The Gene has recently been nominated as a receptor not only for 2-oxogluterate (see alpha-Ketoglutaric acid) but also for the three cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs), particularly leukotriene E4 (LTE4) and to far lesser extents LTC4 and LTE4. Recent studies implicate GPR99 as a cellular receptor which is activated by LTE4 thereby causing these cells to contribute to mediating various allergic and hypersensitivity responses.  History  In 2001, a gene projected to code for a G protein-like receptor protein was reported; the gene's apparent protein product was classified as an orphan receptor (i.e., a receptor whose activating ligand and function were unknown) and named GPR80. The projected amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by the GPR80 gene bore similarities to a purinergic receptor, P2Y1, and therefore might, like P2Y1, be a receptor for purine compounds. Shortly thereafter, a second report found this same gene, indicated that it coded for a G protein receptor with its amino acid sequence similarities closest to purinergic receptors GPR91 and P2Y1, and named the gene and its protein GPR99 and GPR99, respectively. While the latter report found that a large series of purinergic nucleotides, other nucleotides, and derivatives of these compounds did not activate GPR99-bearing cells, a third report in 2004 found that GPR99-bearing cells bound and responded to two purines, adenosine and Adenosine monophosphate, nominated GPR99 as a true purinergic receptor, and renamed GPR99 as P2Y15. However, a review of these studies in the same year by members of the International Union of Pharmacology (IUPHAR) Subcommittee for P2Y receptor nomenclature and classification decided that GPR80/GPR99 is not a P2Y receptor for adenosine, AMP or other nucleotides. Again in 2004, another report found that GPR99-bearing cells responded to alpha-ketoglutarate. This report was accepted by IUPHAR. The gene and its protein were renamed OXGR1 and OXGR1. Finally, in 2013, GPR99-bearing cells were found to bind and respond to CysLTs. The latter finding, while attracting further studies and of potential clinical importance, has not yet lead to a renaming of GPR99 nor its protein product.  Gene and product  GPR99 (OXGR1) is localized to human chromosome 13 at position 13q32.2; it codes for a cellular G protein coupled receptor linked primarily to G protein heterotrimers containing the Gq subunit; when bound to one of its activating ligands, the GPR99 protein stimulates cellular pathways (see Gq alpha subunit#Function) that lead to cell function.http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=162  Activating ligands  GPR99 appears to be the receptor for alpha- ketoglutarate (AKG) and CysLTs. CyslTs and AKG have the following relative potencies in binding to GPR99-bearing cells, LTE4>>LTC4=LTD4>AKG; LTE4 is able to stimulate responses in these cells at concentrations as low as picomole/liter.  Inhibiting ligands  GPR99 is inhibited by montelukast, a well-known and clinically useful inhibitor of cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLTR1); this drug binds to CysLTR1 thereby blocking the binding and action of LTD4, LTC4, and LTE4. It is presumed to act similarly to block the actins of these cystienyl leukotrienes on GPR99. It is not known if other CysLTR1 inhibitors (see Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1#Clinical significance) can mimic montelukast in blocking GPR99.  Expression  Based on their content of GPR99 mRNA, GPR99 is expressed in human kidney, placenta, fetal brain, and tissues involved in allergic and hypersensitivity reactions such as the lung trachea, salivary glands, eosinophils, mast cells derived from umbilical cord blood, and nasal mucosa, particularly the vascular smooth muscle in the latter tissue. In mice, Gpr99 mRNA is expressed in kidneys, testes, and smooth muscle.  Function  GPR99 binds as is activated by LTE4 at concentrations far lower than the other major CysLT receptors, Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLTR1) and Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2 (CysLTR2), both of which appear to be physiological receptors for LTD4 and LTC4 but not LTF4 (see Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1#Function). This suggests that the actions of LTE4 are mediated, at least to a large extent, by GPR99. Several findings support this notion: a) pretreatment of guinea pig trachea and human bronchial smooth muscle with LTE4 but not LTC4 or LTD4 enhances their contraction responses to histamine; b) LTE4 is as potent as LTC4 and LTD4 in eliciting vascular leakage when injected into the skin of guinea pigs and humans; c) inhalation of LTE4 but not LTD4 by asthmatic subjects caused the accumulation of eosinophils and basophils in their bronchial mucosa; d) mice engineered to lack Cysltr1 and Cysltr2 receptors exhibited edema responses to the interdermal injection of LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 but only LTE4 was more potent (by a factor of 64-fold) proved more potent in these mice compared to in wild type mice; and e) mice engineered to lack all three Cysltr1, Cysltr2, and Gpr99 receptors showed no dermal edema responses to the injection of LTC4, LTD4, or LTE4. Mice deficient in Gpr99 (i.e. Oxgr1-/- gene knockout mice) develop (82% penetrance) spontaneous Otitis media with many characteristics of the human disease; while the underlying cause of this development, the Oxgr1-/- mouse is proposed to be a good model to study and relate to human ear pathology. GPR99 also appears to be involved in the adaptive regulation of bicarbonate (HCO(3)(-)) secretion and salt (NaCl) reabsorption in the mouse kidneys undergoing acid-base stress: the kidneys of GPR99 gene knockout mice did not respond to alpha-Ketoglutaric acid by upregulating bicarbonate/NaCl exchange and exhibited a reduced ability to maintain acid-base balance.  Clinical significance  Montelucast is in use to treat various conditions including asthma, exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, allergic rhinitis, primary dysmenorrhoea (i.e. dysmenorrhoea not associated with known causes; see dysmenorrhea#causes), and urticaria. It has been presumed that this drug's beneficial effects in these diseases is due to its well-known ability to act as a receptor antagonist for the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLTR1), i.e. it binds to but does not activate this receptor thereby interfering with LTD4, LTC4, and LTE4 provocative actions by blocking their binding to CysLTR1 (the drug does not block the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2) (see cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1#Clinical significance). The more recently discovered ability of this drug to block the ability of LTE4 and LTD4 to stimulate GPR99 in GPR99-bearing cells allows that montelucast's beneficial effects on these conditions might reflect its ability to block not only CysLTR1 but also GPR99.

He has announced broadcasts of Montreal Canadiens games since 1989. Over the years he was partnered with Pierre Bouchard and Yvon Pedneault. From 2007 to 2011, his partner was former Canadiens' player Benoit Brunet. In 2010-11 Joël Bouchard was his partner in the booth, but when Bouchard left for the Blainville-Boisbriand Armada in 2011, he was replaced by former NHL goaltender Marc Denis. Houde also broadcasts Formula One Races at the same station along with Bertrand Houle. Houde's goal call is \\"Le tir, et le but!\\" (\\"A shot, and a goal!\\") after every Canadiens goal, though depending on the moment he stretches \\"but\\" out for several seconds. Other calls are \\"Eh bien, coup de théâtre, ma parole!\\" which he often uses when unbelievable situations occur and \\"Les rouges s'éteignent... et on roule!!\\" at the start of a Formula One Grand Prix. Houde does hockey play by plays on Le Hockey Du Samedi Soir, Le Hockey Du Mardi Soir, Le Hockey Du Jeudi Soir and any other days the Canadiens play. Houde has acquired a fairly large following among the Canadiens' anglophone fans, many of whom watch his telecasts rather than those on Hockey Night in Canada. Houde is fluently bilingual in both English and French. However, he has only called two games in English. When Dino Soto, the English play-by-play announcer for the Canadiens on CJAD, was unable to get back to Montreal from a party to celebrate the station's 50th anniversary, he asked Houde to step in and to call CJAD's broadcast of the Canadiens' game against the Detroit Red Wings on December 2, 1995. Houde reluctantly agreed, as no other experienced anglophone broadcaster was available. The Canadiens lost that game in an 11-1 rout that proved to be Patrick Roy's last game with the team before being traded to the Colorado Avalanche. The second came when he called a Canadiens game against the Pittsburgh Penguins on RDS' anglophone sister, The Sports Network. Houde had previously been considered for the play- by-play spot with the Avalanche. Houde started his broadcasting career at CKOI-FM as a weekend DJ when he was 20 years old and still going to École des hautes études commerciales de Montréal (HEC Montréal) . His first sports broadcasting was doing half-time NFL broadcasts in French as a freelancer. Houde was one of the original staff at RDS when it started in September 1989. Houde is from Saint-Laurent, Quebec, now a borough in the city of Montreal. He shares his life with Lyne Couture since summer 2018.

Like other members of this subfamily, i.e. GPR4, OGR1 (GPR68), and TDAG8 (GPR65), G2A is a G protein coupled receptor that resides in the cell surface membrane, senses changes in extracellular pH, and can alter cellular function as a consequence of these changes. Subsequently, G2A was suggested to be a receptor for lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). However, the roles of G2A as a pH-sensor or LPC receptor are disputed. Rather, current studies suggest that it is a receptor for certain metabolites of the polyunsaturated fatty acid, linoleic acid.  The G2A gene  G2A in humans is encoded by the GPR132 gene. The G2A gene (Gene ID: 29933) is located on chromosome 14q32.3 codes for two alternative splice variants, the original one, G2A-a, and G2A-b, that consist of 380 and 371 amino acids, respectively; the two receptor variants, when expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, gave very similar results when analyzed for functionality. G2A-a and G2A-b mRNA are expressed at similar levels in blood leukocytes ( macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils [PMN], mast cells, T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes at the highest levels followed by lower levels in spleen, lung and heart tissues; both variants are expressed at similar levels, and are almost equally induced by DNA synthesis inhibitors (hydroxyurea and cytosine arabinoside) or a differentiation inducer (all-trans retinoic acid) in HL-60 human leukemic cells. The mouse G2A receptor, encoded by Gpr132, has 67% amino acid identity to human G2A but does not sense pH and does not respond to certain presumptive ligands (i.e. linoleic acid metabolites) that activate the human G2A.  G2A deficiency in mice  Targeted disruption of G2A in mice causes the development of a late onset (> 1 year) slowly progressive wasting and autoimmune disease characterized by lymphoid organ enlargement, lymphocytic infiltration into various tissues, glomerular immune complex deposition, and anti-nuclear autoantibodies. Mice transplanted with bone marrow cells containing the BCR-ABL leukemia-inducing fusion gene but deficient in G2A exhibit expanded populations of leukemic cells compared to recipients of BCR-ABL-containing, G2A-sufficient bone marrow cells. BCR-ABL is the oncogene of the Philadelphia chromosome that causes human Chronic myelogenous leukemia and is sometimes found associated with human acute lymphocytic leukemia and acute myelocytic leukemia; furthermore, the forced expression of BCR-ABL in cultured rodent cells induces the expression of G2A and the overexpression of G2A inhibits the malignant growth to these cells. Thus, the G2A deficiency studies suggest that G2A functions in mice to suppress certain immune dysfunctions and BCR-ABL-related leukemic cell growth.  G2A function   pH sensor  G2A was initially defined as one of the gene products whose production was stimulated in mouse pre-B lymphocytes (see Immunoglobulin heavy chain) by transfecting the cells with the human oncogene (i.e., cancer causing) BCR-ABL or by treating the cells with DNA damaging agents; its expression in these cells blocked their progression through the cell cycle specifically at the G2-M DNA damage checkpoint. These studies allow that G2A limits the potentially malignant growth of certain cells in mice and possible could do so in humans. In addition, Gene knockout studies in mice find G2A to be necessary for suppressing an autoimmune syndrome (see G2A deficiency in mice). These results allow that G2A may function in blocking certain aspects of autoimmunity, particularly those involving the proliferation and tissue trafficking of lymphocytes. Early studies first classified G2A as a proton-sensing receptor and suggested that G2A contributed to the regulation of proliferation in certain cells and the regulation of lymphocytes' contributions to certain immune functions by being activated by changes in extracellular pH. Tissues suffering malignant cell growth, autoimmune reactions, poor blood flow ischemia, inflammation and allergy reactions, and tissue injury develop extracellular acidification due to the stimulation of anaerobic glycolysis; The proton-sensing function of G2A could be involved in combating or, in certain cases promoting these conditions. An example implicating G2A's pH sensitivity in physiological responses involves pain perception. In rats, G2A, similar to other pH sensing GPCRs, is located in dorsal root ganglia neurons, small diameter neurons responsible for nociception, and other nerve tissues responsible for sensing pain; it is suggested that G2A in these nerve tissues detects the acid changes that occur in the extracellular media of injured tissues and signal for the perception of pain> However, the activity of the human G2A receptor and its mouse homolog are significantly less sensitive to pH fluctuations than other pH sensing GPCRs; indeed, in studies of thymocytes and splenocytes taken from mice deficient in either the G2A or another pH- sensing GPCR, TDAG8, TDAG8 was found critical while G2A was found dispensable for sensing pH changes. Thus, the cited functions of G2A presumed due to its pH sensing ability could reflect other means for this receptor's activation.  Receptor for lyso-phospholipids  A report working with human neutrophils proposed that G2A was a receptor for a phospholipid, lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), and a Sphingomyelin, sphingosylphosphorylcholine. However, these studies did not give evidence that these lyso-phospholipids actually bound to G2A; some 4 years later this report was withdrawn. Nonetheless, many of LPC's activities do depend on G2A; more recent data suggest that rather than acting directly as a ligand that binds to G2A, LPC alters G2A's distribution within the cell by increasing its movement from the cell interior to the cell surface and/or by preventing its movement away from the cell surface to the cell interior. That is, in neutrophils and other cell types which have internal stores of G2A in membrane-bound secretory vesicles, G2A-containing vesicles continuously merge with and move back out of a cell's surface membrane. Lyso-phospholipids may act as a)) detergents to increase a cell's permeability thereby allowing entry of small extracellular molecules such as ionic calcium which trigger the movement of the intracellular vesicles to the surface membrane or b) agents that intercalate or wedge into the cell's surface membrane to promote this vesicle movement or slow this vesicle movement out of the membrane . Such effects increase the expression of G2A at the cell surface membrane which, if G2A has a sub- stimulatory level of activity when normally express but stimulatory when it is overexpressed at the surface membrane, may lead to G2A-dependent cellular responses. With respect to this view, small decreases in extracellular pH reduce the internalization of G2A thereby increasing its surface membrane expression. LPCs that contain the unsaturated fatty acids hexadecanoic acid or octadecanoic acid bound to their sn-1 act to permeablize, while LPC with the monounsaturated fatty acid, oleic acid at sn-1 act to perturb target cell surface membranes. While not involving G2A receptor binding, some actions of LPCs are G2A-dependent. For example, LPCs increase the bactericidal activity of rodent neutrophils, enhance hydrogen peroxide production in rodent neutrophils triggered by the ingestion of bacteria, stimulate the chemotaxis of human monocytes, and protect mice from the lethal effects of experimentally induced bacterial sepsis endotoxin. G2A may similarly be responsible for the activities of other phospholipids which, like LPC have not been shown to bind to G2A but still require G2A for certain of their activities viz., lysophosphatidylserine and lysophosphatidylethanolamine; these two lyso- phospholipids stimulate calcium signaling pathways in human neutrophils by a G2A dependent mechanism. Furthermore, activated neutrophils greatly increase their surface membrane content of lysophosphatidylserine. In a mouse model, mouse neutrophils with increased levels of lysophosphatidylserine on their surface membrane due to cell activation or artificial addition showed an increase in there engulfment by mouse macrophages in vitro that was dependent on the expression of G2A in the macrophages and an increased rate of clearance in mice by a mechanism that was dependent on the expression of G2A by the mice. Lysophosphotidylserine-laden neutrophils stimulated the G2A-dependent production the anti-inflammatory mediator, prostaglandin E2, by macrophages in the in vitro studies and inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, interleukin-6 and keratinocyte chemoattractant, in in vivo studies. G2A is also involved in blood-borne lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) mediated amplification of microbial TLR ligands induced inflammatory responses from human cells https://doi.org/10.1002/JLB.3AB0720-241RR. Taken together, these studies suggest that G2A, activated by certain phospholipids contributes not only to the development but also the resolution of certain inflammation and innate immune responses in mice and may also do so in humans.  Receptor for fatty acid metabolites  The linoleic acid metabolites, 9(S)-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE), (9R)-HODE, and 13(R)-HODE (see 9-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid and 13-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid), and the arachidonic acid metabolites 5(S)-hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid (see 5-HETE), 12(S)-HETE (see 12-HETE), 15(S)-HETE (see 15-hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid), and racemic 5-HETE, 12-HETE, 15-HETE, 8-HETE, 9-HETE, and 11-HETE stimulate Chinese hamster ovary cells made to express G2A; these effects, unlike those of phospholipids, appear to involve and require the binding of the metabolites to G2A as evidenced by the ability of the most potent of these metabolites, 9-HODE to stimulate G2A-dependent functions in membranes isolated from these cells. 9-HODE induces cultured normal human epidermal keratinocytes to stop growing by inhibiting their cell cycle at the G1 stage; it also stimulates these cells to secrete three cytokines that stimulate keratinocyte growth vis., interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and GM-CSF. These activities are G2A-dependent. It is suggested that 9-HODE acts in human skin to block the proliferation of damaged cells while concurrently, by triggering the secretion of the cited cytokines, stimulating the proliferation of undamaged skin cells; these actions may thereby serve to rejuvenate skin damaged for example by UV light.

They had apparently traveled through various places in the United States before being killed in South Carolina. This was inferred from some of their belongings. The crime scene, depicting both victims' bodies as discovered Each victim had been shot three times, receiving one shot in the throat, one in the chest, and one in the back. The weapon used was believed to be a .357 caliber revolver. Sumter County Coroner Verna Moore continued to work on the case until her retirement in 2009. The case remains unsolved. Neither of the victims' identities has been discovered, despite the fact that their descriptions, sketches of their faces, dental information, and fingerprints have been distributed across the United States. Authorities have decided to halt the investigation until the victims can be identified. The male victim had been referred to as \\"Jock\\", which may have originated from the French name \\"Jacques,\\" indication he may have been from French Canada. A man who claimed he had met the victims stated that he was told by the male victim that he had left his Canadian family with his girlfriend. The male victim had furthermore stated that his father was a well known doctor; this supported the theory that his family was wealthy. Discovery of the bodies In the early morning hours of August 9, 1976, the young man and woman were said to have been seen from a distance by a hermit. It was said they had been dropped off on Locklair Road, a secluded dirt road between I-95 and S.C. 341 (Lynches River Road). It is possible that the victims had had their vehicle hijacked, possibly by hitchhikers. Then, upon their exiting the vehicle, someone may have shot them both in the back. At 6:20 a.m., a trucker named Martin Durant found the bodies and contacted Charles Graham, an employee at a nearby store. Graham, in turn, contacted the authorities. Male victim The male victim was at first believed to be between 18 and 22 years of age, but his dentition suggested that he may have been older than 27. The age range was updated to be between 18 and 30 years after his case was entered into NamUs. The forensic dentist who examined the man's teeth said he believed he was over 27, but that he had looked younger due to his clothing and build. The victim was white with an olive complexion. He had brown, shoulder-length hair, brown eyes, and very distinctive bushy eyebrows. He stood over 6 feet tall, weighed about 150 pounds, and had had extensive, elaborate dental work that may have been performed outside the United States. This might indicate a higher socioeconomic status. A unique type of root canal surgery had been performed during the man's life, which could be important for discovering who he was. It looked as if he had been midway through a complete dental restoration. The man had a four-inch appendectomy scar. He also had various scars on his back and shoulders, which indicated frequent participation in contact sports. .357 Magnum revolvers, the type of gun used for the murders. He was wearing faded Levi brand jeans and a red T-shirt. The shirt read \\"Coors — America's Light Beer\\" on the front and \\"Camel Challenger GT Sebring '75\\" on the back, along with a Snoopy design. The shirt was apparently a promotional item from the Sebring Races held in Sebring, Florida, in 1975, which were sponsored by the Coors Brewing Company. He wore no underwear and carried a pack of \\"Grant's Truck Stop\\" matches in a pants pocket. The matches are believed to have come from a Grant's Truck Stop in the Midwest. He wore a yellow gold Bulova Accutron wristwatch with a Twist-o-Flex band, bearing the serial number H918803. Using this number, investigators were able to determine that Bulova had made the watch in 1968. But when the Bulova company downsized in the early 1970s, they destroyed many of their records, meaning that there was no way to ascertain where the victim's watch was distributed or bought. He also wore a 14-karat gold ring set with a gray star sapphire stone. The initials JPF were engraved inside the ring, which had a Florentine finish. Both the ring and the watch were rather expensive. This, together with the man's elaborate dental work, suggested that he had come from an affluent family. Female victim The female victim was slightly younger than the man. She was originally thought to be between 18 and 20 years old. After her case was entered into NamUs, her age estimate was increased to 18 to 25 years. She stood 5' 5\\" tall, weighed 100 to 105 pounds, and had a slim build and an olive complexion like that of her companion. This led some observers to speculate that they may have been siblings. She had reddish-brown, shoulder-length hair and bluish-gray eyes (some sources state \\"hazel\\"). She had two distinctive moles on the left side of her face near her mouth. Wedge-heeled sandals, similar those worn by the female victim. The coroner noted that the young woman had unusually long, natural eyelashes and that both victims were very clean and well-groomed. She had fillings in all of her back teeth, and her front teeth would have appeared straight and even if she were to smile. She had no surgical scars, had never been pregnant, and her legs had not been shaved. Unlike her male companion, no scars were found on her body. She was wearing an unbleached white muslin blouse over a pink, front-tying halter top. She wore blue denim cut-off shorts (Daisy Dukes). She had a floral print scarf tied around her waist as a belt. She wore Stride-Rite brand wedge-heeled sandals that were lavender and hot pink in color. She wore three very distinctive rings. * The first ring was a black, oblong stone with what appeared to be small turquoise chips embedded in it. * The second had an ornate scrolling feather shape with coral and turquoise stones. * The third was a simple metal band with red, white, and blue stones. These rings appeared to be authentic handmade Native American or Mexican costume jewelry. They were all made of sterling silver. They appeared to have originated in the Southwestern United States. Like the man beside her, the female victim wore no underwear. Leads and theories In 1977, a man was arrested in Latta, South Carolina for driving while intoxicated. He owned a revolver (found in his vehicle) of the same kind as the murder weapon. It was proven to be the murder weapon after it was test-fired by investigators. The man was located but was not charged because insufficient evidence existed to file charges against this individual with the murders. Investigators traveled to the city of Brunswick, Georgia. They met with a mother and father who were thought to be possible acquaintances of the Jane Doe. Their daughter was missing and her ex-boyfriend had reported a similarity between the female victim and his ex-girlfriend. However, after showing the parents of the missing woman photographs of the female victim, neither they nor her friends could verify that it was her. After a dental comparison, it was found that the two women did not match. The initials JPF, engraved inside the man's ring, supported the theory that his name was Jacques or at least started with a J. The book of matches found in the man's pocket provided a further clue. The matches came from a truck stop chain which had locations in Idaho, Nebraska, and Arizona. After information was released to the public, a man from Nebraska stated that he may have performed repairs on a car with Oregon or Washington license plates, whose owners matched the description of the victims. But this uncovered no additional leads. Some speculate that notable serial killer Henry Lee Lucas could have been involved in the murders. Lucas himself told police that he had been in South Carolina the day that the victims died, but he was received with scepticism as he had a penchant for false confessions. He was never charged with the crime and died in 2001 due to heart failure.\\"Eternity's gate slowly closing at Peckerwood Hill.\\" Houston Chronicle. August 3, 2012. Retrieved on 7 August 2014. Earlier, Lucas had confessed to two murders that also happened in Sumter County; that of an elderly woman in 1975 and of a young man in 1983. Like most other leads, this revealed no additional clues to the pair's names or their actual murderer. In 2007, both bodies were exhumed to obtain DNA information. This led to the theory that the pair had been siblings being disproved; the testing showed that they were not genetically related, though they did resemble each other. On October 12, 2020, the DNA Doe Project released the results from their genealogical tests. Burial The couple's bodies were kept at a local funeral home in caskets with airtight, see-through lids in hopes that someone would identify them. People from all over the country called to inquire about them, including several parents of young runaways. None was able to identify the bodies. The bodies remained on display until they began to deteriorate. On August 14, 1977, one year and five days after the bodies were found, they were interred in Bethel United Methodist Church Cemetery in Oswego, South Carolina. Hundreds attended the funeral service. Law enforcement agencies raised several hundred dollars to pay the funeral home.

Initially, the group's members are: Dracule Mihawk, Crocodile, Gecko Moria, Jimbei, Boa Hancock, Don Quixote Doflamingo, and Bartholomew Kuma.

Reception  Allen Divers of Anime News Network comments that the male character designs of One Piece are \\"often quite varied and unique\\", while the female ones become \\"a bit repetitive\\". He also notes that, as the characters are \\"defined by what they seek\\", there is little room \\"for actual development\\". Todd Douglass, Jr. of DVD Talk simply states that the series' characters have a lot of \\"charm\\". His colleague Carl Kimlinger describes the visual style of One Piece as \\"unconventional\\" with \\"grotesquely exaggerated expressions, simple eyes, big mouths and bigger teeth\\", \\"supremely ugly supporting characters and skinny, gangly-limbed main cast\\" and comments that \\"it's all amazingly distinctive, utterly appropriate, and surprisingly cool—in a goofy kind of way\\". He also notes that \\"Funimation's English dub is light-years better than the 4Kids debacle\\", \\"unusually accurate, professional, and largely enjoyable, which is far, far more than can be said of the previous dub\\". He laments that Funimation's version of \\"Crocodile loses his sepulchral charisma\\" and that \\"the original's fine dance on the edge of mawkish sentimentality is disrupted often enough by less-than-stellar acting\\". He also states that \\"Colleen Clinkenbeard's Luffy is more a generic spunky kid than a personality in his own right, really coming to life only during the action scenes during which she does a fine job of being darned cool.\\" Dustin Somner of Blu-ray.com comments that the Japanese and Funimation voice-acting is \\"fairly good, but not exceptional\\" and sometimes \\"overly zany\\". Todd Douglass Jr. of DVD Talk notes \\"the daunting cast of characters, both good and bad\\" as \\"one of the appealing factors\\" of the anime, but also comments that \\"Some of the voices [of the 4Kids dub] were pretty irritating ... with a lot of high- pitches and over exaggerated speech.\\" Brigitte Schönhense of Splashcomics comments that the \\"brilliant\\" () flashbacks into the characters' pasts make them so \\"likeable and lovable\\" (German: \\"sympathisch und liebenswert\\") and that they are the manga's real strength. Mania Entertainment writer Jarred Pine comments that Oda's characters are \\"whacky\\" and that his \\"bizarre\\" character designs create \\"wonderful characterizations and personalities\\". He notes the \\"well illustrated\\" facial expressions and says that \\"it's the whacky characterizations and designs that makes One Piece its own\\". His colleague Bryce Coulter comments that \\"One Piece's bizarre character designs will keep your attention as they can be very random and often memorable. Not the prettiest, but it will definitely capture your attention.\\"  Notes   References   Citations   One Piece manga  = Entire series = * Oda, Eiichiro. One Piece. 93 vols.

Constantin realizes that Adrian used him and breaks all ties with his father. The dark side Constantin becomes interested in Lisa again, who is dating Andi Fritzsche. He builds a friendship with his former girlfriend and hopes that it becomes more again. But Lisa is so in love with Andi, that she doesn't have any romantic feelings for Constantin at all. So, Constantin tries to sabotage Lisa's relationship to Andi and wants Olivia Schneider to seduce him. Olivia agrees, when Constantin manages to get her a job at the Lahnstein Holding. The deal is made and Olivia is successful and can really make it look like that she seduced Andi. Happy that Lisa breaks up with Andi, he soon needs to realize that this didn't wake Lisa's interest in him. When the truth about his scheme comes out, he also fears to lose Lisa as a friend. But she later can forgive him. In a time where it is difficult for him to find his place in life, Constantin lets himself go and parties all the time. It gets more and more serious that he fears to fail his graduation. He becomes very desperate and blackmails his teacher Anne Siebert with her secret relationship with Paul. When Paul finds out about Constantin blackmailing Anne, the friendship almost gets destroyed over it. But Constantin comes to his senses and apologizes to Anne and Paul forgives his friend soon before he leaves town with Anne, after the relationship came out anyway. A love story in the making After Paul leaving town, Constantin becomes closer with Johannes again. The two manage to rebuild a relationship as father and son and Constantin finally knows that he doesn't need his real father as long as he would have Johannes in his life. But Johannes is presumed death, after his plane went down over the Atlantic Ocean. Grieving of the death of Johannes, he finds a good friend in Judith Hagendorf. He becomes interested in her, but has competition with Fabian Brandner. Constantin builds very strong feelings for Judith and tries to prove them to her. But Judith is already in love with Fabian and tries to find her happiness with him. But it doesn't work out and Fabian breaks up with Judith, after she didn't tell him about a one-night stand his mother Katja had. Constantin wants to be there for Judith and comforts her over the breakup. But he also realizes that he still has these strong feelings for Judith. They spend much time together and after a while, Constantin starts to believe that Judith feels the same way about him. She stays by him, when nobody is on his side with his opinion over Adrian, who seemed to rescue the life of Carla her daughter. But Constantin believes that he kidnaps her and wants to blackmail him in saying the truth. Adrian needs a kidney and Constantin is a match. Constantin has only one condition for helping him - he wants him to confess the truth. Adrian signs a confession, but it becomes useless, when Constantin tells his family how he got it. Constantin helps him anyway and Judith stays by him and thinks it's a brave thing that he is doing. He believes that Judith and he finally become their chance. But Judith once again falls for someone else, who turns out to be Fabian's brother David. Constantin gets tired over Judith's feelings for David and is hurt that she can't see him as more than a friend. When Judith is finally giving up on David, Constantin confesses his feelings to her. Surprised by that, Judith tells him that she hasn't the same feelings for him and wants them to stay as friends. But their friendship becomes more and more complicated over Constantin's feelings for her. He becomes interest in journalism and applies for a school in London. Meanwhile, Judith begins to discover her feelings for Constantin. She confesses her love for him, but Constantin isn't ready to believe her. After all what happened and that he tried to be more than her friend more than once, he just fears to get hurt once again by a person. When he is taken by the school in London, Constantin decides to go. On the airport it comes to a tearful goodbye between Judith and Constantin. She once again tells him that she loves him and doesn't want him to go. With a last kiss, Constantin leaves and a heartbroken Judith is left behind. He returns the next summer, when Carla wants to talk to him about a family matter. She tells him that their supposedly dead mother Francesca is still alive and has returned to Castle Königsbrunn. Constantin and Carla don't know that it's really their repudiated aunt Maria di Balbi, who works for Ansgar. At first Constantin has a hard time accepting Maria as the not-so-dead Francesca, but he comes around eventually. When Judith finds out that Constantin is in town, she gets all nervous and doesn't know where they stand after all this time. When they meet each other, Constantin shocks Judith with the confession that he has a girlfriend in London and that they would be better of as friends. But later Constantin visits her to say goodbye before returning to London. He can't hide his feelings and the two end up sleeping together. After that, he tells Judith that he lied and that he hasn't a girlfriend waiting for him. He was just afraid, knowing that the two would have no future with Constantin in England. Constantin and Judith agree to be just friends. But they both can't stop thinking about each other. Constantin spends Judith a surprise visit, where he asks her if she missed him. Judith confesses that she was just thinking about him. He doesn't know if that's enough, but he asks her to come with him to London anyway. Judith is happy, kisses Constantin and agrees to go with him. They just pack one bag, before saying goodbye to Olli and Christian and leaving Düsseldorf. He appears once again on the wedding of Christian's brother Gregor Mann, where he tells the family how happy he and Judith are in London. Constantin also finds out the truth about Maria. Affair with Nathalie After Olli and Christian got engaged and plan their wedding with Constantin and Judith as attending guests, the couple is surprised when Constantin appears on their door step. He asked to stay awhile and it doesn't take the friends too long to figure out that he and Judith have split after a half year. Andi offers him to talk about what's bothering, but Constantin doesn't seem ready. His life seems shattered once again, which later is even more clear after he bumps into Maria. Lost in his thoughts he walks down the streets and almost gets hit by a car, when Nathalie Käppler appears out of nowhere to rescue his life. Constantin and Nathalie form a friendship and she helps him learning to speak Spanish for a job. Constantin is taken by surprise when he starts having feelings for his tutor. When Nathalie is confronted by Constantin's feelings, she tells him that they'll never have a chance and that she's in love with Matthias Brandner. Constantin tries to accept Nathalie's relationship to Matthias and swears to concentrate on his Spanish lessons. But Nathalie begins to develop an attraction for Constantin, which ends in a kiss. Because the two get interrupted, Constantin is left confused. Nathalie later talks to him, telling him that something like that can never happen again. Constantin even wants to end his lessons with her, but when Matthias starts asking questions about Nathalie and Constantin's behavior around each other; both want to make it look like everything is all right. Closeness between them strikes again as a result and Nathalie and Constantin end up sleeping together. After that Nathalie realizes that her future is with Matthias. After he found out about Nathalie's affair with Constantin, Matthias marries her anyway. Shortly after this Constantin gets a job offer to work as a journalist in an executive position in Madrid. He thinks it through together with Christian and decides to not pass at this chance. Constantin leaves for his new job and once again says goodbye to his friends in Düsseldorf. Departure and returns Milan Marcus asked to be released from his contract in September 2008 after wanting to focus on college.

Discovery  GPR84 (EX33) was described practically in the same time by two groups. One was the group of Timo Wittenberger in the Zentrum fur Molekulare Neurobiologie, Hamburg, Germany (Wittenberg T. et al.) and the other was the group of Gabor Jarai in Novartis Horsham Research Centre, Horsham, United Kingdom. In their papers they described the sequence and expression profile of five new members of GPC receptor family. One among them was GPR84 which represents a unique GPCR sub-family so far.  Gene  Hgpr84 locates to chromosome 12q13.13, and its coding sequence is not interrupted by introns.  Protein  The human and the murine GPR84 ORFs both encode proteins of 396 amino acid residues length with 85% identity and are therefore considered as orthologs. The hgpr84 was found by Northern blot analysis as a transcript of about 1.5 kb in brain, heart, muscle, colon, thymus, spleen, kidney, liver, intestine, placenta, lung, and leukocytes. In addition, a 1.2 kb transcript in heart and a strong band at 1.3 kb in muscle were detected. A Northern blot from different brain regions revealed strongest expression of the 1.5 kb transcript in the medulla and the spinal cord. Somewhat less transcript was found in the substantia nigra, thalamus, and the corpus callosum. The 1.5 kb band was also visible in other brain regions, but at very low levels. EST clones corresponding to hgpr84 were from B cells (leukemia), neuroendocrine lung as well as in microglial cells and adipocytes. A more detailed description of expression profile can be found in www.genecards.org. The resting expression of GPR84 is usually low but it is highly inducible in inflammation. Its expression on neutrophils can be increased with LPS stimulation and reduced with GM-CSF stimulation. The LPS- induced upregulation of GPR84 was not sensitive to dexamathasone pretreatment. There was also a GPR84 downregulation in dentritic cell derived from FcRgamma chain KO mice. In microglial cells, the GPR84 induction with interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) was also demonstrated. 24 h treatment with IL-1β also induced 5.8 times increase in GPR84 expression on PBMC from healthy individuals. . Transcriptional dynamics of human umbilical cord blood T helper cells cultured in absence and presence of cytokines promoting Th1 or Th2 differentiation was studies. It turned out that GPR84 belongs to the Th1 specific subset genes. While another publication suggests that GPR84 is rather a CCL1 related Th2 type gene. GPR84 was also upregulated on both macrophages and neutrophyl granulocytes after LPS stimulation. Not only LPS challenge but Staphylococcus enterotoxin B was sufficient to cause a 50 times increase in GPR84 expression on isolated human leukocytes stimulated with compared to the expression of naive leukocytes. A viral infection following Japanese encephalitis virus infection also increased GPR84 expression by 2-4.5% in the mice brain. Ablating lysosomal acid lipase (Lal-/-) in mice led to aberrant expansion of myeloid-derived suppressive cells (MDSCs) (>40% in the blood, and >70% in the bone marrow) that arise from dysregulated production of myeloid progenitor cells in the bone marrow. Ly6G + MDSCs in Lal-/- mice show strong immunosuppression on T cells, which contributes to impaired T cell proliferation and function in vivo. GPR84 was 9.1 fold upregulated in the MDSCs of Lal-/- mice. GPR84 is normally expressed at low levels in myeloid cells and can be induced in vitro by stimulating macrophage or microglial cells with LPS, TNFα, or PMA. Elevated expression of GPR84 was also observed during the demyelination phase of the reversible Cuprizone-Induced Demyelinating Disease mouse model. Finally, it has also shown that GPR84 expression is increased in both the normal appearing white matter and plaque in brains from human Multiple Sclerosis patients. Expression of GPR84 increases in mouse whole brain samples from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis before the onset of clinical disease. In cultured microglia in response to simulated blast overpressure the expression of GPR84 was increased 2.9 fold. In ageing TgSwe mice were subjected to traumatic brain injury GPR84 was upregulated by 6.3 fold. GPR84 expression was increased by 49.9 times in M1 type macrophages isolated from aortic atherosclerotic lesions of LDLR-/- mice were fed a western diet. GPR84 is important in regulating the expression of cytokines: CD4+ T cells from GPR84-/- mice show increase IL-4 secretion in the presence of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies; GPR84 potentiates LPS-induced IL12p40 secretion in RAW264.7 cells. Recent work by Nagasaki et al. explored 3T3-L1 adipocytes cocultured with RAW264.7 cells to examine this potential interaction. RAW264.7 coculture increases GPR84 expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and incubation with capric acid can inhibit TNFα-induced adiponectin release. Adiponectin regulates many metabolic processes associated with glucose and fatty acids, including insulin sensitivity and lipid breakdown. Furthermore, a high-fat diet can increase GPR84 expression. The authors suggest that GPR84 may explain the relationship between diabetes and obesity. As adipocytes release fatty acids in the presence of macrophages, the loop of increased GPR84 expression and its stimulation prevent the release of regulating hormones. The work on GPR84 is still very early and needs to be expanded in the context of pathophysiology and immune regulation. Some people presume the role of GPR84 in food intake too. GPR84 is expressed in the gastric corpus mucosa and this receptor can be an important luminal sensors of food intake and are most likely expressed on entero-endocrine cells, where it stimulates the release of peptide hormones including incretins glucagon-like peptide (GLP) 1 and 2.  Ligands  The ligands for GPR84 suggest also a relationship between inflammation and fatty acid sensing or regulation. Medium-chain free fatty acid (FFA) with carbon chain lengths of C9 to C14. Capric acid (C10:0), undecanoic acid (C11:0) and lauric acid (C12:0) are the most potent described endogeneous agonists of GPR84. Not activated by short-chain and long-chain saturated and unsaturated FFAs induced in monocytes/macrophages by LPS. In addition, the activation of GPR84 in monocytes/macrophages amplifies LPS stimulated IL-12 p40 production in a concentration dependent manner. IL-12 plays an important role in promoting cell mediated immunity to eradicate pathogens by inducing and maintaining T helper 1 responses and inhibiting T helper 2 responses. Medium chain FFAs inhibited forskolin-induced cAMP production and stimulated [35S]GTPgammaS binding in a GPR84-dependent manner. The EC50 values for medium-chain FFAs capric acid, undecanoic acid, and lauric acid at GPR84 (4, 8, and 9 mM, respectively, in the cAMP assay). These results suggest that GPR84 activation by medium-chain FFAs is coupled to a pertussis toxin- sensitive Gi/o pathway. Besides medium-chain FFAs diindolylmethane was also described as GPR84 agonist. However, the target selectivity of this molecule is also questionable because diindolylmethane is an aryl hydrocarbon receptor modulator, too. The patent literature mentions that besides medium chain FFAs other substances as 2,5-Dihydroxy-3-undecyl(1,4)benzoquinon, Icosa-5,8,11,14-tetraynoic acid and 5S,6R-Dihydroxy-icosa-7,9,11,14-tetraenoic acid (5S,6RdiHETE) are also ligands of GPR84. These two latest molecules say against the statement that long chain FFAs are not ligands of GPR84. Based on these results it is probable that besides medium chain FFAs some long chain FFAs can also be endogeneous ligands of GPR84. Further work is needed to confirm this hypothesis.  Major mediator in pathologic fibrotic pathways  GPR84 was discovered to be a major mediator in pathologic fibrotic pathways in 2018.https://ajp.amjpathol.org/article/S0002-9440(17)30804-0/fulltext  Drugs under investigation  The molecule GLPG1205 was under investigation by the Belgian firm Galapagos NV. Its clinical effect against inflammatory disorders like inflammatory bowel disease was being investigated in 2015 in a Phase 2 Proof-of-Concept study in ulcerative colitis patients. The results published in January 2016 showed good pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability. However, the target efficacy was not met. The development of GLPG1205 for ulcerative colitis was therefore stopped.http://www.glpg.com/docs/view/56a70f4ad23cf-en The molecule PBI-4050 which inhibits GPR84 signaling is under investigation by the Canadian biotechnology firm Prometic. As of August 2018, it remains a promising drug targeting multiple type of fibrosis entering phase 3 clinical trials.https://ajp.amjpathol.org/article/S0002-9440(17)30804-0/fulltext.

The county name was also spelled Arapaho County, Arapahoe County, Arrapahoe County, and Arappahoe County. The county seat was Denver City. History In July 1858, gold was discovered along the South Platte River in Arapahoe County, Kansas Territory. This discovery precipitated the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. Many residents of the mining region felt disconnected from the remote territorial governments of Kansas and Nebraska, so they voted to form their own Territory of Jefferson on October 24, 1859. On November 28, the General Assembly of the Territory of Jefferson organized 12 counties: Arrappahoe County, Cheyenne County, El Paso County, Fountain County, Heele County, Jackson County, Jefferson County, Mountain County, North County, Park County, Saratoga County, and St. Vrain's County. The legislation that created Arrappahoe County declared: > That the territory comprised within the following limits, be erected into a > county to be called Arrappahoe county: commencing at a point where the 40th > parallel of north latitude crosses the 104th meridian of west longitude; > thence west on said parallel to the centre of the main channel of the south > fork of the Platte River, thence upon the main channel of said stream to the > mouth of Clear Creek; thence up the main channel of Clear Creek to the mouth > of Ralston's Creek; thence in a straight line to a point where Montana Creek > joins the main channel of the Platte; thence up the main channel of said > stream to the mouth of the canon at the base of the mountains, thence on the > main divide between the waters of the Arkansas and the Platte River, to > where the 104th meridian of longitude crosses the same, thence north on said > meridian to the place of beginning. Arrappahoe County was named for the Arapaho Nation of Native Americans that lived in the region. Denver City served as the county seat of Arrappahoe County and was the territorial capital until November 12, 1860. The Jefferson Territory never received federal sanction, but on February 28, 1861, U.S. President James Buchanan signed an act organizing the Territory of Colorado. On November 1, 1861, the Colorado General Assembly organized 17 counties, including Arapahoe County, for the new Colorado Territory. On November 15, 1902, the State of Colorado split Arapahoe County into three new counties: the City and County of Denver, Adams County, and South Arapahoe County (soon to revert to Arapahoe County). Elections And Elected Officials Arapahoe County's first office holding official was William M. Slaughter, appointed by Governor Robert Williamson Steele in December 1859 as President Judge of Arapahoe County. He was to hold office until the county's first popular election was held on January 2, 1860.

Discovered several years after the leukotriene B4 receptor 1 (BLT1), BLT2 receptor binds leukotriene B4 (LTB4) with far lower affinity than the BLT1 receptor does and therefore has been termed the low affinity LTB4 receptor. Sometime after its initial discovery, the BLT2 receptor was shown to bind and become activated by several other arachidonic acid metabolites, one of which, 12-hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid (12-HHT), has 10- to 100-fold higher affinity for it than does LTB4; 12-HHT fails to bind or activate BLT1 receptors. While BLT2 receptors have some actions similar to BLT1 receptors, they have other actions which clearly oppose those of BLT1 in regulating inflammation and allergic responses; BLT2 receptors also have actions that extend beyond those of BLT1 receptors. Laboratory, animal, and other pre-clinical studies suggest that BLT2 receptors may be involved not only in inflammation and allergy but also in human cancer.  Function  BLT2 is a Cell surface receptor that functions by recognizing, binding, and mediating responses to a particular set of messenger molecules or ligands. These messenger ligands are any one of a range of structurally different arachidonic acid metabolites made and released by nearby cells to act as paracrine signals for coordinating responses between cells or autocrine signals for modulating their parent cells' responses.  Genes  Several years after their identification of a Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) receptor termed BLT1 or BLTR1 and encoded by the LTB4R1 gene, Shimizu and colleagues identified a second LTB4 receptor, BLT2 or BLTR2, encoded by the LTB4R2 gene. LTBR1 and LTBR2 encode for proteins with 45% amino acid identity that belong to the G protein–coupled receptor superfamily. The two genes form a cluster on human and mouse chromosome 14; in humans but not mice, this cluster has a very unusual configuration in that LTBR2's open reading frame overlaps the Promoter (genetics) and 5' Untranslated region of LTBR1. The significance of this overlap is not known. Monkeys, rats, and dogs have also been shown to express LTB4R2 orthologs. Two BLT2-like receptors, Blt2a and Blt2b, with 49% amino acid identity to each other and 34% and 29%, respectively, amino acid identities to human BLT2 have been cloned from Zebrafish embryos. The latter citation presents a phylogenic tree on the amino acid relateness of these two receptors as well as those from humans, monkeys, dogs, rats and mice to each other.  Mechanism of action  BLT2 receptors, similar to BLT1 receptors, are G protein coupled receptors that, when ligand-bound, activate G proteins that contain either the Gi alpha subunit and are therefore inhibited by pertussis toxin or the Gq alpha subunit and therefore not inhibited by pertussis toxin. (Pertussis toxin sensitivity is an imported test for G protein receptor linkages.) BLT2 receptors stimulate cells to transiently elevated cytosolic calcium ion concentrations, thereby activating calcium- activated intracellular signaling molecules; it also stimulates cells to activate Extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), Protein kinase B (also known as Akt), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), Janus kinase (JAK)-STAT protein (i.e. signal transducer and activator of transcription, NADPH oxidase (NOX), and NF-κB pathways. One prominent cell-activating pathway involves BLT2 receptor activation of NOX2 or NOX1 with the subsequent production of reactive oxygen species which in turn activate the transcription inducing function of NF-κB.Am J Cancer Res. 2013 Aug 14;3(4):347-55. eCollection 2013  Tissue distribution  The human BLT2 receptor is expressed in a wide range of tissues including spleen, blood leukocytes, liver, ovary, pancreas, heart, prostate gland, testes, small intestine, kidney, lung, colon, thymus, muscle, and placenta; this contrasts with the BLT1 receptor which appears to have a more limited expression pattern including mainly circulating blood leukocytes and lymphocytes. The mouse Blt2 receptor also shows a more limited distribution pattern than the human BLT2 receptor, showing appreciable expression in the small intestine and skin, and low expression in the colon and spleen.  Ligands  While initially defined as a low affinity receptor for the 5-lipoxygenase product of arachidonic acid metabolism, LTB4, BLT2 binds and is activated by not only LTB4 but also the cycloxygenase-thromboxane synthase enzyme pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism, 12-Hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid (12-HHT) as well as by three products of the 12-lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism, 12(S)-HETE, 12(S)-HpETE, and 12(R)-HETE (see 12-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, by a member of the 15-lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism, 15(S)-HETE (see 15-Hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid), and by another member of the LTB4 family of arachidonic acid metabolites, 20-hydroxy-LTB4; the relative BLT2 receptor- binding affinities of these 7 metabolites are ~1000, 100, 10, 10, 3, 3, and 1, respectively. Thus, the most recently discovered ligand, 12-HHT, which does not bind to BLT1 receptors, shows by far the highest affinity of all of the tested ligands for BLT2 receptors. Among these 7 ligand, in contrast, BLT1 binds and is activated by only LTB4 and 20-hydroxy-LTB4. The two BLT4-like receptors in Zebrafish, Blt2a and Blt2b, when transfected into chinese hamster ovary cells, mediate rises in cytosolic calcium responses to both 12-HHT and LTB4 with 12-HHT being about 500- to 1000-fold stronger that LTB4 in doing so; 12-HHT is inactive in this assay in chinese hamster ovary cells made to express the Zebrafish LTB4 receptor-1 (Blt1). Thus, BLT1 receptor exhibits exquisite specificity, binding 5(S),12(R)-dihydroxy-6Z,8E,10E,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid (i.e. LTB4) but not LTB4's 12(S) or 6Z isomers whereas the BLT2 receptor exhibits a binding pattern that includes S and R stereoisomers, aracidonic acid metabolites composed of 17 and 20 carbons, and metabolites with a hydroxyl residue at the 5, 12, or 15 position. BLT2's binding pattern can only be considered as promiscuous. This promiscuous binding pattern complicates determination of which arachidonic acid metabolite and which metabolite-forming oxygenase (i.e. cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase) is responsible for any given BLT2-dependent response. These determinations are often critical to defining the full mechanisms involved in, as well as the means for inhibiting or promoting, the functions of BLT2. Based on the rather large structural differences in the known BLT2 receptor ligands, there may be other as yet undefined ligands that bind to and activate this receptor. For example, the Formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPL2 receptor) was initially suggested to be a second receptor with ~70% amino acid identity to Formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPL1 receptor). Both receptor types bind and are activated by a series of formylated oligopeptide chemotactic factors but FLP2 receptor appears to be a promiscuous receptor in that it also binds to and is activated by lipoxins and resolvins as well as various polypeptides and proteins. The FLP2 receptor appears to be engaged primarily in dampening and resolving inflammation responses, actions which appear to be diametrically opposite to the pro-inflammatory actions of FLP1 receptors.  Btr2 knockout mice  The expression of Blt2 receptors in mice appears limited to fewer tissues than the BLT2 receptor in humans; Blt1 is robustly expressed only in mouse small intestine and skin. LTB4R2 knockout mouse studies, therefore, may reveal a more limited role for the BLT2 receptor than that in humans. BLT2 receptor knockout mice exhibit attenuated ovalbumen- induced allergic airway eosinophilia and interleukin 13 (IL-13) content in their bronchoalveolar lavage fluid compared with wild type mice and CD4-positive T cells isolated from the knockout mice showed a reduction IL-13 production but there was no change in the bronchospasm response to ovalbumin in these mice. The BLT2 receptor ligand(s) and metabolic pathway(s) producing this ligand(s) were not identified. These results indicate that the Blt2 receptor functions to promote the eosinophilic-base inflammation which accompanies and may contribute to allergic lung disease; this effect may be do in part to its ability to reduce production of the pro-allergic cytokine, IL-13; the receptor does not appear to be responsible for allergen-induced bronchospasm. BLT2 receptor could play a similar role in human allergic diseases such as asthma. In response to the oral administration of the inflammation-inducer dextran sodium sulfate, Blt2 receptor knockout mice, compared to wild type or Blt1 receptor knockout mice, exhibited: a) more severe colitis inflammation and body weight loss; b) increased mRNA expression for the pro-inflammatory cytokines interferon-γ, IL1B, and Interleukin 6, two pro-inflammatory chemokines viz., chemokine ligand 9 (also termed chemokine ligand 10) and chemokine 19 (CCL19), and metalloproteinases-3, -10, and -13 in inflamed colon tissues; c) enhanced accumulation of interferon-producing macrophages in affected colon tissues; d) increased phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (i.e. STAT3) in the crypts of affected colon tissue; and e) reduced colon mucosa integrity and barrier function as deduced from the effects of in vitro studies on the impact of BLT2 receptor expression on leakage of FITC-dextran in Madin-Darby canine kidney II cells. These results suggest that Blt2 receptors normally function to suppress colon inflammation in mice; based on its mass content in affected colon tissues, 12-HHT appears at least partly responsible for maintaining this function by stimulating Blt2 receptors. A similar role for the 12-HHT-BLT2 axis could occur in humans and be relevant to diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. LTB4R1 gene knockout provides complete protection from the joint inflammation occurring in a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis (collagen-induced arthritis); double knockout of LTB4R1 snf LTB4R2 genes did not alter the complete protection afforded by LTB4R1 knockout. Further evidence for the role of BLT2 in arthritis was seen in a model of serum transfer arthritis where loss of BLT2 led to weakened inflammation and damage to joints. Thus, the knockout studies available to date assign BLT2 receptors a protective role in dampening certain allergic and inflammatory responses; this role contrasts with the assignment of BLT1 receptors as contributing to both these types of responses. More study is needed to determine if BLT2 receptors protect against other allergic and inflammatory responses and if they function similarly in humans.  Bltr2 transgenic mice  The overexpression of BLT2 receptors in Bltr2 transgenic mice enhances the ability of subcutaneously injected LTB4 and 12-HETE to stimulate new blood vessel formation in skin. Studies indicate that the actions of both ligands were mediated by Blt2 receptors and, that Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) stimulated BLT2 expression and 12-HETE production in Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), and that BLT2 receptor or 12-lipoxygenase knockdown inhibited VEGF-induced angiogenesis in in vitro assays. These results suggest tha BLT2 receptors play critical roles in the development of VEGF-induced neovascularization and are of particular interest to the roles of BLT2 receptors in the growth and spread of cancers and in inflammation (see below).  Activities and clinical significance   Allergic airways disesase  Mouse bone marrow mast cells and human eosinophils exhibit in vitro chemotaxis responses to 12-HHT. Since both cell types are implicated in allergic reactions, this suggests that BLT2 receptors could contribute to allergic responses in mice and humans. However, in a mouse model of ovalbumin-induced allergic airway disease: a) 12-HHT and its companion cyclooxygenase metabolites, Prostaglandin E2 and Prostaglandin D2, but not 12 other lipoxygenase or cyclooxygenase metabolites showed a statistically significantly increase in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid levels after intratracheal ovalbumin challenge; b) only 12-HHT, among the monitored BLT2 receptor-activating ligands (i.e. LTB4, the 12(S) stereoisomer of 12-HETE, and 15(S)-HETE) rose to a level capable of activating BLT2 receptors; and c) BLT2 knockout mice exhibited a greatly enhanced response to ovalabumin challenge. This study also found that the expression of BLT2 receptors was significantly reduced in CD4+ T cells (which are known to mediate allergy-reactions) taken from asthmatic compared to non-asthmatic human controls. Thus, BLT2 receptors suppress allergic airways disease in mice and may function similarly in humans. These studies also allow that BLT2 receptors play suppressive functions in other allergic diseases.  Inflammation  The high affinity BLT2 receptor agonist, 12-HHT, stimulates in vitro chemotactic responses in human neutrophils, suggesting that this receptor, similar to BLT1 receptors, contributes to inflammation by recruiting circulating blood neutrophils to disturbed tissue sites. Other studies, however, indicate that the role of BLT2 receptors in inflammation is directed toward other cell types than neutrophils and differs very much from that of BLT1 receptors. Immortalized human skin keratinocyte HaCaT cells respond to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation by generating toxic reactive oxygen species which in turn triggers the cells to become apoptotic and eventually die. This response is BLT2 receptor-dependent since a) topical treatment of mouse skin with a BLT2 receptor antagonist, LY255283, protects against UVB radiation-induced apoptosis; b) BLT2-overexpressing transgenic mice exhibit more extensive skin apoptosis in response to UVB irradiation that wild type mice; and c) 12-HHT inhibits HaCaT cells from synthesizing the pro-inflammation mediator, interleukin-6 (IL-6), in response to UVB radiation. Furthermore, BLT2 receptor knock-out mice mount of more severe intestinal inflammation response to dextran sodium sulfate than either wild type or BLT1 receptor knockout mice (see Knockout studies). Thus, BLT2 receptors appear responsible for suppressing UVB-induced skin inflammation and, in contrast to BLT1 receptors, oppose the development and thereby dampen the severity of experimental colitis in mice.  Cancer  The Ras subfamily of small GTPases function as Signal transduction proteins by transmitting the presence of extracellular stimuli into inducing the expression of genes which regulate cellular survival, proliferation, differention, adherence to extracellular matrix, and motility as well as factors that are released to promote new blood vessel formation (i.e. Neovascularization) and to alter the extracellular matrix; the three members of this subfamily, KRAS, NRAS (i.e. Neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog), and HRAS, develop point mutations to become oncogenes that drive the growth and spread of some 20% of all human cancers. The highest levels of Ras mutations are found in adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (90%), colon (50%), and lung (30%) Bos, 1989). Race oncogenes can stimulate arachidonic acid metabolism: a) HRAS, in a rat intestinal epithelial cell line, and KRAS, in a rat lung epithelial cell line, up-regulate COX2 expression and prostglandin synthesis; b) HRAS induces 12-lipoxygenase in the human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells;Biochim Biophys Acta. 1997 Feb 18;1344(3):270-7 and c) HRAS stimulates the expression of 5-lipoxygenase, 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein, LTB4, and BLT2 receptors Rat2 and a rat fibroblast cell lines thereby increasing the tumor-forming ability the latter cell line in athymic mice. These studies suggest that the metabolites of cyclooxygenase, 5-lipoxygenase, and 12-lipoxygenase, i.e. 12-HHT, LTB4, and 12-HTE, respectively, may act through BLT2 receptors to contribute to the growth and spread of cancers initiated and/or oncogenic Ras and possibly other oncogenes. This is supported by findings that BLT2 is abnormally expressed in many human cancers that concurrently overexpress these arachidonic acid metabolizing pathways viz., follicular thyroid adenoma, Renal cell carcinoma, urinary bladder Transitional cell carcinoma, esophagus squamous cell carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, the Serous cystadenocarcinoma type of ovarian cancer, and uterine cervical carcinoma. Other studies have implicated BLT2 in these and other types of cancer as follows. = Prostate cancer = 12-HHT stimulates the PC3 human prostate cancer cell line to activate several pro-growth and/or pro-survival signaling pathways including protein kinase B, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, protein kinase C, proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src, and (by inducing the proteolytic cleavage and release of a ligand for the Epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] receptor from HB-EGF), EGFR. When detached from surfaces, cultured non-malignant PWR-1E and PC3 prostate cancer cells die by engaging suicidal apoptosis pathways, a reaction termed anoikis. This is accompanied by increased expression of BLT2 receptors, activation of NADPH oxidase (NOX), increases in NOX-mediated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ROS-induced activation of the pro-survival transcription factor, NF-κB. Ectopic expression and stimulation of BLT2 receptors by 12(S)-HETE or a synthetic BLT2 receptor agonist, CAY-10583, inhibits whereas Gene knockdown by mRNA interference or pharmacological inhibition by LY255283 enhances these cells' anoikis response to surface detachment. Unlike PC-3 cells, LNCaP and CWR22rv-1 human prostate cancer cell lines require exogenous androgen for their survival; this mimics the androgen dependency exhibited by most human prostate cancers in their early, untreated stages. Both cell lines overexpress BLT2 receptors compared to the PWR-1E non-malignant human prostate cell line. Treatment with the BLT2 receptor antagonist, Ly255283, caused both cell lines to become apoptotic; furthermore, BLT2 receptor knockdown using interference mRNA caused LNCaP but not PWR-1E cell apoptosis. The effect appears due to the loss of BLT2-induced NOX4 generation, consequential reactive oxygen species- induced NF-κB-activation, and NF-κB-stimulated expression of androgen receptors. 12-HETE also increases the survival of PC-3 cells by helping to maintain high levels of phosphorylated Rb retinoblastoma protein, an effect which reduces the ability of retinoblastoma protein to inhibit the synthesis of DNA and thereby cell division. Finally, 12-lipoxygenase is overexpressed and the mass of 12-HETE is far higher in human prostate cancer than nearby normal prostate tissue; These findings suggest that BLT2 receptors operate to promote the survival, growth, and spread of human prostate cancer It remains unclear which if any of its 12-HHT, LTB4, and/or 12-HETE ligands mediate BLT2 receptor activation in the human disease. = Uninary bladder cancer = LTB4 and 12(S)-HETE stimulate the invasivenes in an in vitro Matrigel invasion assay of highly malignant human 253 J-BV unirnary bladder cancer cell; their activity in this assay is completely inhibited by a pharmacological inhibition or siRNA knockdown of BLT2 receptors. The expression of 5-lipoxygenase, 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein, 12-lipoxygenase (enzymes synthesizing LTB4 and 12(S)-HETE, respectively) as wells as LTB4 and 12(S)-HETE were substantially elevated in these cells. Pretreatment of these cells with an inhibitor of BLT2 receptos, reduced their tumor forming ability after injection into mice; intraperitoneal injections of LY255283 into the mice also decreased the metastasis-forming ability of the cells after injection in the urinary bladder. Finally, BLT2 receptor protein was over expressed by the malignant tissues of human urinary bladder cancer and this expression was positively associated with the severity of this cancer. The action of BLT2 receptors, similar to their actions on prostate cancer cells, appeared to involve the receptors activation of the NOX, reactive species of oxygen, NK-κB pathway. These results suggest that BLT2 receptors contribute to the aggressiveness and progression of human urinary bladder cancer. = Breast cancer = Compared to non-malignant IMR-90 and immortalized but non- malignant MCF-10A human breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7, ZR-75-1, T47-D, MDA- MB-231, MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-453, and SK-BR-3 human breast cancer cell lines (see list of breast cancer cell lines) overexpress BLT2 mRNA and protein but show relatively little expression of BLT1 mRNA; treatment of the malignant but not non-malignant cells with a BLT2 antagonist, LY255283, but not a BLT1 antagonist, U75302, blocked proliferation of the cells in culture. LY255283 concurrently caused apoptosis in estrogen receptor negative MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-453 but not estrogen receptor positive MCF-7 and T47-D malignant cells. Since LY255283 also inhibits the BLT1 receptor, the apoptosis-inhibiting action of BLT2 receptors was also demonstrated by showing that siRNA-induced transient Gene knockdown of BLT2 receptors caused apoptosis in the MDA-MB-468 cell line. BLT2 receptors link to the activation of the NADPH oxidase, NOX1 (a synthesizer of the Superoxide anion which is a reactive oxygen species that, when inappropriately overproduced, causes cell death and tissue injury); the attendant increased production of reactive oxygen species and activation of NF-κB appeared responsible for these BLT-2 receptor dependent effects. Lipopolysaccharide (i.e. endotoxin) stimulates MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cells to increase their invasiveness as determined with in vitro Matrigel Invasion Chamber assays; this effect appears due to its ability to induce the overexpression of BLT2 receptors, the enzymes which produce LTB4 and 12(S)-HETEs, and the key metabolites of these enzymes, LTB4 and 12(S)-HETE; furthermore, the latter the binding of the latter metabolites to cells overexpressed BLT2 receptors leads to the activation of NF-κB. These results indicate that the 12-HETE/BLT2 interaction reduces the survival of cultured human breast cells by stimulating the production of reactive oxygen species and the activation of NF-κB. Epithelial–mesenchymal transition, a process whereby epithelial cells assume a mesenchymal phenotype, is proposed to occur in a subset of cells in various cancer tissues to promote their movement from a tumor site into blood and lymphatic vessels and thereby form distant metastases. Human breast cancer often expresses and appears promoted by Ras proteins (see carcinogenesis and the Ras subfamily). The forced expression of oncogenic Ras in cultured human MCF-10A breast cancer cells markedly up- regulates BLT2 receptors and this up-regulation appears essential for the epithelial–mesenchymal transition-promoting ability of Transforming growth factor beta in these cells; BLT2 receptors in these cells appear to stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species and activation of NF-κB and may thereby contribute to the metastatic ability of breast cancer. Since BLT2 receptors are significantly elevated in human breast cancer tissue compared to non-cancerous breast tissue, the cited studies, when taken together, indicate that BLT2 receptors promote the malignant growth, invasiveness, metastasis and possibly anti-cancer drug resistance of not only cultured human breast cancer cells but also of human breast cancer. = Ovarian cancer = Compared to CAOV-3 human ovarian cancer cells, SKOV-3 and CAOV-3 human ovarian cancer cells over express BLT4 receptors, LTB4 and 12-HETE metabolizing enzymes, two key metabolites of these enzymes, LTB4 and 12-HETE, and activated STAT3 also are far more invasive in animal models. Inhibition of BLT2 receptors by LY255283 but not of BLT1 receptors by U75302 and suppression of BLT2 receptors by siRNA treatment reduced the expression of NOX4 (i.e. NADPH oxidase 4, the reactive oxygen species made by this enzyme, activated STAT3, the invasion- promoting enzyme, MMP 2, and the in vitro invasiveness (Matrigel invasion assay) of SKOV-3 and CAOV-3 cells. LY255283 also inhibited the peritoneum metastasis of intra-peritoneal injected SKOV-3 cells in athymic mice. These studies indicate that the stimulation of BLT4 receptors by LTB4 and/or 12-HETE operate through a NOX4-reactive oxygen species-STAT-3-MMP2 pathway to promote the metastasis of SKOV-3 and CAOV-3 cancer cells in mice and may act similarly to promote metastases in human ovarian cancer. = Pancreatic cancer = BLT2 receptor protein and mRNA was found to be markedly elevated in human advanced pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias in their primary pancreas sites as well as in lymph node metastasis sites; mRNA for BLT1 was also elevated in these tissues but to a ~5-fold greater extent. Both receptors' mRNA were also expressed in a wide range of human pancreas cancer cell lines with BLT1 receptor mRNA ~2-fold greater than that for BLT2. The stable over expression of BLT2 in AsPC-1, Colo357, and PANC-1 human pancreas cancer cell lines increased these cells' in vitro growth rates; specific BLT2 agonists also stimulated Colo367 and Panc-1 cell growth. BLT2 receptors mediated the in vitro migration of Panc-1 cells. These results allow that BLT2 receptors may contribute to the malignant growth and metastasis of human pancreas cancer. = Colon cancer = The proliferation of Caco-2 human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cells in culture was stimulated by 12-HETE and inhibited by a somewhat selective inhibitor of 12-lipoxygenase, baicalein; the stimulatory effect of 12-HETE appeared due to its interaction with BLT2 receptors based on the effects of pharmacological inhibitors. = Esophageal cancer = Esophagus squamous cell carcinoma overexpresses BLT2 receptors.  Other activities  The BLT2 receptor mediates the itch scratching behavior induced by intradermal injection of 12-HETE in mice.  Antagonist  LY255283 has been presented as a \\"selective\\" BLT2 receptor antagonist. However, this compound is also a BLT1 receptor agonists and therefore cannot be used to discriminate between these two receptor types. In all of the studies using LY255283 quoted above, other methods, such as siRNA knockdown, were used in conjunction with LY255283 to identify BLT2-dependency. Currently, there are no reports on selective BLT2 receptor antagonists.

There are many such privileges recognised by the judicial system, some stemming from the common law and others from statute law. Each privilege has its own rules, which often vary between jurisdictions.  Types  One well known privilege is the solicitor–client privilege, referred to as the attorney–client privilege in the United States and as the legal professional privilege in Australia. This protects confidential communications between a client and his or her legal adviser for the dominant purpose of legal advice.Esso Australia Resources Limited v The Commissioners of Taxation (1999) 201 CLR 49;168 ALR 123 The rationale is that clients ought to be able to communicate freely with their lawyers, in order to facilitate the proper functioning of the legal system. Other common forms include privilege against compelled self-incrimination (in other proceedings), without prejudice privilege (protecting communications made in the course of negotiations to settle a legal dispute), public interest privilege (formerly Crown privilege, protecting documents for which secrecy is necessary for the proper functioning of government), spousal (marital) privilege, medical professional privilege, and clergy–penitent privilege. In the US, several states have enacted the Uniform Mediation Act (UMA) which specifies a mediator's privilege with regard to state procedures. In the United Kingdom, the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 provides that evidence relating to spent convictions (those in respect of which the Act says the convicted person is rehabilitated, generally older and less serious ones) is inadmissible, and provides privilege against answering questions relating to such convictions; although some exceptions apply, in particular in criminal proceedings.  Effect  The effect of the privilege is usually a right on the part of a party or witness to a case, allowing them to refuse to produce evidence in the form of documents or testimony from the person entitled to the privilege. For example, a person can generally prevent their attorney testifying about the legal relationship between attorney and client, even if the attorney were willing to do so. In this case the privilege belongs to the client and not the attorney. In a few instances, such as the marital privilege, the privilege is a right held by the potential witness. Thus, if a wife wishes to testify against her husband, she may do so even if he opposes this testimony; however, the wife has the privilege of refusing to testify even if the husband wishes her to do so. On the other hand, the person entitled to a privilege is at liberty to waive the privilege.

This protein was earlier thought to be a receptor for vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and was considered to be an orphan receptor. It is now classified as a chemokine receptor able to bind the chemokines CXCL12/SDF-1 and CXCL11. The protein is also a coreceptor for human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV).

Coaching career Illinois State Cowdrey was the 16th head football coach for the Illinois State Redbirds in Normal, Illinois and he held that position for four seasons, from 1977 until 1980. His overall coaching record at ISU was 12 wins, 31 losses, and 1 tie. This ranks him 11th at ISU in terms of total wins and 17th at ISU in terms of winning percentage.Illinois State Coaching Records Charlie Cowdrey became perhaps the only football coach in NCAA history to be fired less than 24 hours after his team had scored a major upset.Pantagraph.com  Sports  From Pages Past Southwestern College From 1983 to 1991, he was the 23rd head coach for the Southwestern College Moundbuilders in Winfield, Kansas where he compiled a record of 59 wins and 34 losses with 1 tie, taking over the program from famed football coach Dennis Franchione. He held the position for nine season and became the 7th most successful coach at Southwestern College in terms of winning percentage (65.2%) and second in terms of total number of wins with 59.Southwestern College - Winfield, KS Cowdrey took his teams to two separate bowl games, coaching half of the post-season bowls in school history. Both appearances were in the Sunflower Bowl, and the team lost both times. But 1984 was the first year that Southwestern qualified for the NAIA Football National Championship. The first round the team defeated conference rival Bethel 17–14, and then lost to Northwestern College by a score of 45-23. About being fired from the post, his son Bruce Cowdrey (also a football coach) related this story: :\\"A long time ago, my dad, Charlie Cowdrey (former Illinois State coach) was coaching Southwestern College in Winfield, Kan., when I asked him how he felt about being fired, ... he said, ‘When I came here, the first school president loved me. The second one didn't like football. The third one, he fired the chaplain. So I knew I was next.'\\" Morningside College After Southwestern, Cowdrey became the head coach at Morningside College in Sioux City, IowaLawrence Journal-World \\"Southwestern Tabs Cabell\\" May 14, 1992 from 1993 through the 1995 season.

It is the 39th entry in the series released by Columbia Pictures starring the comedians, who released 190 shorts for the studio between 1934 and 1959. Plot The Stooges are singing waiters in a saloon out West, accompanied by three cowgirls. Unfortunately, saloon keeper Maxey (Dick Curtis) is surly and patronizing to the hard working girls. The girls have little choice, as they are forced to work for him because their father is in debt. The Stooges vow to make enough money to pay off the debt and wed the girls, and decide to go prospecting for gold. Unknown to the Stooges, however, Maxey has recently robbed a bank and buried the loot. Before they find the stolen treasure with the stocks and gold bonds, the Stooges have a mishap, when a rock hits Curly, and thinking that it was Moe's doing, throws a rock at Moe, causing Moe to throw a stick of dynamite, which lands near Yorick, the burro. When their dog takes the stick of dynamite and puts it into the box of canned food supplies, Moe thinks that Yorick ate the dynamite and tries to have the burro drink from a bucket of water, before the explosion. In their digging, the boys managed to discover Maxey's stash, thinking they are truly in the dough. They return to town, but Maxey gets his hands on the money and flees the saloon. The Stooges, of course, catch up with Maxey, retrieve the loot, and end up giving back to the bank from whence it came, much to their astonishment.

GPR126 is a member of the adhesion GPCR family. Adhesion GPCRs are characterized by an extended extracellular region often possessing N-terminal protein modules that is linked to a TM7 region via a domain known as the GPCR-Autoproteolysis INducing (GAIN) domain. GPR126 is all widely expressed on stromal cells. The N-terminal fragment of GPR126 contains C1r-C1s, Uegf and Bmp1 (CUB), and PTX-like modules.  Ligand  GPR126 was shown to bind collagen IV and laminin-211 promoting cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) to mediate myelination.  Signaling  Upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or thrombin stimulation, expression of GPR126 is induced by MAP kinases in endothelial cells. During angiogenesis, GPR126 promotes protein kinase A (PKA)–cAMP-activated signaling in endothelial cells. Forced GPR126 expression in COS-7 cells enhances cAMP levels by coupling to heterotrimeric Gαs/i proteins.  Function  GPR126 has been identified in genomic regions associated with adult height, more specially trunk height, pulmonary function and adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. In the vertebrate nervous system, many axons are surrounded by a myelin sheath to conduct action potentials rapidly and efficiently. Applying a genetic screen in zebrafish mutants, Talbot’s group demonstrated that GPR126 affects the development of myelinated axons. GPR126 drives the differentiation of Schwann cells through inducing cAMP levels, which causes Oct6 transcriptional activities to promote myelin gene activity. Mutation of gpr126 in zebrafish affects peripheral myelination. Monk’s group demonstrated domain-specific functions of GPR126 during Schwann cells development: the NTF is necessary and sufficient for axon sorting, while the CTF promotes wrapping through cAMP induction to regulate early and late stages of Schwann cells development. Outside of neurons, GPR126 function is required for heart and inner ear development. GPR126 stimulates VEGF signaling and angiogenesis by modulating VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) expression through STAT5 and GATA2 in endothelial cells. Disease Mouse models have shown GPR126 deletion to affect cartilage biology and spinal column development, supporting findings that variants of GPR126 have been associated with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, and Mutations have been shown to be responsible for severe arthrogryposis multiplex congenita  References   External links  * Adhesion GPCR consortium G protein-coupled receptors ","title":"GPR126"},{"id":"14440094","text":"In cell biology, ion trapping is the build-up of a higher concentration of a chemical across a cell membrane due to the pKa value of the chemical and difference of pH across the cell membrane. This results in basic chemicals accumulating in acidic bodily fluids such as the cytosol, and acidic chemicals accumulating in basic fluids. Mechanism Many cells have other mechanisms to pump a molecule inside or outside the cell against the concentration gradient, but these processes are active ones, meaning that they require enzymes and consume cellular energy. In contrast, ion trapping does not require any enzyme or energy. It is similar to osmosis in that they both involve the semipermeable nature of the cell membrane. Cells have a more acidic pH inside the cell than outside (gastric mucosal cells being an exception). Therefore, basic drugs (like bupivacaine, pyrimethamine) are more charged inside the cell than outside. The cell membrane is permeable to non- ionized (fat-soluble) molecules; ionized (water-soluble) molecules cannot cross it easily. Once a non-charged molecule of a basic chemical crosses the cell membrane to enter the cell, it becomes charged due to gaining a hydrogen ion because of the lower pH inside the cell, and thus becomes unable to cross back. Because transmembrane equilibrium must be maintained, another unionized molecule must diffuse into the cell to repeat the process. Thus its concentration inside the cell increases many times that of the outside. The non-charged molecules of the drug remain in equal concentration on either side of the cell membrane. The charge of a molecule depends upon the pH of its solution. In an acidic medium, basic drugs are more charged and acidic drugs are less charged. The converse is true in a basic medium. For example, Naproxen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that is a weak acid (its pKa value is 5.0). The gastric juice has a pH of 2.0. It is a three-fold difference (due to log scale) between its pH and its pKa; therefore there is a 1000× difference between the charged and uncharged concentrations. So, in this case, for every one molecule of charged Naproxen, there are 1000 molecules of uncharged Naproxen at a pH of 2.http://www.angelfire.com/tx5/scribe2003/scribe/august/F081709.doc This is why weak acids are better absorbed from the stomach and weak bases from intestine where the pH is alkaline. When pH of a solution is equal to pKa of dissolved drug, then 50% of the drug is ionized, another 50% is unionized. This is described by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Pharmacokinetics Ion trapping is the reason why basic (alkaline) drugs are secreted into the stomach (for example morphine), where pH is acidic, and acidic drugs are excreted in urine where the conditions are alkaline. Similarly, ingesting sodium bicarbonate with amphetamine, a weak base, causes better absorption of amphetamine (in stomach) and its lesser excretion (in urine), thus prolonging its actions. Ion trapping can cause partial failure of certain anti-cancer chemotherapies. Ion trapping is also important outside of pharmacology. For example, it causes weakly acidic hormones to accumulate in the cytosol of cells. This is important in keeping the external concentration of the hormone low in the extracellular environment where many hormones are sensed. Examples of plant hormones that are subjected to ion trapping are abscisic acid, gibberellic acid and retinoic acid. Examples of animal hormones subjected to ion trapping include Prostacyclin and Leukotrienes.

Wisconsin is part of the largest American Viticultural Area (AVA), the Upper Mississippi Valley AVA, which includes southwest Wisconsin, southeast Minnesota, northeast Iowa, and northwest Illinois. The state also has two smaller designated American Viticultural Areas, the Lake Wisconsin AVA and the Wisconsin Ledge AVA. The Wisconsin Winery Association is a statewide organization that promotes wine making in the state. History The first wine grapes were planted in Wisconsin by Agoston Haraszthy in the mid-19th century. Before he migrated to California and helped to found the wine industry there, he established a vineyard, winery and wine cellars overlooking the Wisconsin River at what is today the Wollersheim Winery near Prairie du Sac. Although Haraszthy found the climate of Wisconsin difficult for wine grape production, later German settlers produced wine using both European and native American grape varieties.The Wisconsin Winery Association. History of Winemaking in Wisconsin The first modern winery in Wisconsin, the von Stiehl Winery in Algoma, opened in 1967. By 2007, 41 wineries operated in the state.\\"Midwestern wine: Move over, California\\", The Economist, August 23, 2008 . Accessed September 7, 2008. Today over 110 wineries have commercial operations in Wisconsin, with most making wines from other fruits in addition to grapes. Some Wisconsin wineries rely upon vineyards in other states for all or part of their grape sources.

Arrival Virginia  Capps Point Historical Marker, Hampton, Virginia He traveled to the Colony of Virginia aboard the Sea Venture and was apparently among those shipwrecked in Bermuda for several months before reaching the New World. William Capps arrived in Virginia in 1609-1610 and settled at Kecoughtan on the west side of the Hampton River. This site is in present-day Hampton, Virginia and is on the opposite side of the Hampton River from the grounds of Hampton Institute. There is a street called \\"Capps Quarters\\"Capps Quarters Location in this area that is almost certainly part of William Capps' original tract of land. A Virginia historical marker is posted in this area. This point, patented by William Capps about 1634, was known for a century as Capps Point.A Guidebook to Virginia's Historical Markers, Charlottesville: The University of Virginia Press, 1994, p. 184.Tyler, Lyon Gardiner. The Cradle of the Republic: Jamestown and the James River, Richmond, VA: Whittet & Shepperson, General Printers, 1900, p. 160. The area was later renamed Little England. Kecoughtan had originally been the site of an Indian village which on May 1, 1607 had some 18 houses of twigs and bark and 20 fighting men. Indians and whites had lived together at this site for the first years of the Colony, but in summer 1610 Sir Thomas Gates drove the Kecoughtan Indians from the area in retaliation of the killing of a settler at Fort Algernourne (Old Point Comfort). The settlement grew slowly as a report of John Rolfe in 1616 shows: \\"At Keqoughtan, being not farr from the mouth of the river, thirty-seven miles below James Towne on the same side, are twenty [persons] whereof eleven are Farmors.\\"Hatch, Charles E., Jr. The First Seventeen Years, Virginia 1607-1624, Charles E. Hatch, Jr., Charlottesville: The University of Virginia Press, 1957, pp. 97  Ancient Planter  In May-1616 only 350 of all persons who had come to Virginia remained there - the rest having died or given up and returned to England. Three years later in 1619 the first general division of land in Virginia occurred. Those settlers having arrived before 1616 and having three years residence, termed \\"ancient planters,\\" were entitled to .Hatch, Charles E., Jr. The First Seventeen Years, Virginia 1607-1624, Charles E. Hatch, Jr., Charlottesville: The University of Virginia Press, 1957, pp. 22 John Rolfe described the situation in Jan-1620 in glowing terms: \\"All the ancient planters being sett free have chosen places for their dividendes according to the commission, Which giveth all greate content, for knowing their owne landes, they strive and are prepared to build houses & cleere their groundes ready to plant, which giveth ... [them] greate incouragement, and the greatest hope to make the Colony florrish that ever yet happened to them.\\"Frances Mossiker, Pocahontas: The Life and the Legend, Published by Da Capo Press, 1996, p. 197  First House of Burgesses  That same year as the land division, the Colony's Governor issued a call for the first representative legislative assembly in America which convened at Jamestown on July 30, 1619 and remained in session until August 4, 1619. Twenty-two Burgesses met representing the 11 major settlements in Virginia. The Kecoughtan settlement was represented by Capt William Tucker and William Capps. A memorial church built on the foundations of the church in which the House of Burgesses met exists at the Historic Jamestowne National Park Service site on Jamestown Island, Virginia. A monument bearing the names of the Burgesses is located near within the confines of the newly rediscovered original Jamestown fort. It was apparently at their urging that the first House of Burgesses was asked \\"to change the savage name of Kiccowtan, and to give that Incorporation a new name.\\" The new name selected was Elizabeth City after the daughter of King James. In Dec-1619 the population of Virginia was about 900 out of a total immigration of 1440.  Member Virginia Council  In 1627, William Capps was appointed a member of the Council by the Crown upon the recommendation of the Governor. The Councilors were the Governor's advisers in executive matters and constituted the supreme court of the Virginia. They also held legislative functions as members of the upper house of the Virginia Assembly, corresponding somewhat to our senate.William and Mary College Quarterly Historical Magazine (WMCQ), July 1897, Volume VI, p. 194-195. Two years later William Capps asked leave of the Governor to depart the colony on the King's affairs, and when permission was refused, departed any way. In 1630 he returned with the King's letter of instructions to the Council.

This is then cut and rolled into thin strips of about half a centimetre thickness which are formed into rings, briefly cooked in boiling sugar water, then baked in an oven.Bublik and Sushki recipes (in Russian) The rings are generally about 3 to 5 cm in size. Sushki are sometimes topped with poppy seeds. Traditionally, sushki were strung on a string for selling on the street or at regional markets. Nowadays, industrially produced pre-packaged sushki are sold in food shops all over the countries of the former Soviet Union. In other countries, packaged sushki can be found in markets that sell Russian foods.  Similar products and common names  Sushki belong to a class of Eastern European ring-shaped bread products which are briefly boiled before baking. Belarusian and Russian baranki are larger and softer, but still rather dense such that they are often dipped into tea like sushki. Ukrainian bubliki and Polish obwarzanki krakowski are even larger and softer, but not as soft as Jewish bagels. All such products are also commonly referred to as bubliki in Russian and Ukrainian. Alternatively, they are called generically baranki in Russian, obarinki in Ukrainian and abaranki in Belarusian. \\"Baranka-type products\\" () is a formal designation of the product class.

During the early months of each year, the River Jindi has a very limited water supply, but the summer months bring with them much needed rain to water the area. As the river proceeds downstream, the local people use dams, similar to the Warsak Dam on the Kabul River, to take out water for irrigation; therefore, the amount of water flowing downstream decreases. The area surrounding the Kabul and Jindi rivers is one of the largest irrigated areas within Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.Atlas of Pakistan, 1990 This coupled with an exponentially growing population alludes to problems in the future. The River Jindi used to have enough water to sustain the surrounding area, but over the last few years, due to the environmental changes including massive droughts and rising global temperatures, the river does not. This, coupled with growing pollution of the water, is making the ability to acquire fresh clean water detrimental to the area and its surrounding population. The river passes through other villages like Spankharo, Prang Ghar, Palay, Umerzai, Turangzai, Utmanzai and then through one of the tehsil of Charsadda Tangi, and it meets with the Swat River south of Charsadda at Baberra.

It is the 40th entry in the series released by Columbia Pictures starring the comedians, who released 190 shorts for the studio between 1934 and 1959. Plot The Stooges are traveling salesmen in the fictional country of Valeska, described as a \\"thriving kingdom in the tropics.\\" The lazy town is only slightly stirred awake by its frequent earthquakes, though there is a quiet revolution on the horizon. The revolutionary leader (Gino Corrado) also happens to run the hotel where the Stooges are staying, and he decides to close the place down. When the trio cannot pay their bill, they are in jail and are sentenced to be shot as revolutionaries. During their stay, the Stooge befriend Señorita Rita (Carmen LaRoux), another member of the revolutionaries, and she helps the Stooges escape. They make their way to the rebels where they are sentenced to be shot for bringing the wrong plans. Saved by an earthquake, the trio escape in a dynamite truck which blows up due to Curly's stupidity. They survive and try to ride out of the country only to fall off the horse. Production notes Saved by the Belle was filmed on December 12–15, 1938. The film title is a play on the boxing expression \\"saved by the bell.\\" It was the final Three Stooges short to be directed by veteran comedian Charley Chase, who died of a heart attack on June 20, 1940. When the Stooges introduce themselves to the rebels upon their arrival, Moe is heard saying \\"Hello, doh!\\" This line is from the Stooges' \\"Maharaja\\" routine, which would be performed in future films Time Out for Rhythm, Three Little Pirates and The Three Stooges Go Around the World in a Daze. When the Stooges are in front of the firing squad, believing they are to get their picture taken, Curly poses and says to Moe \\"I'm gonna send one home to Elaine\\". This is a reference to his then-wife Elaine Ackerman, whom he was married to from 1937 to 1940. Curly almost laughs and breaks character when the team lands on the immobile cigar store horse.

The first description of the law of contagion appeared in The Golden Bough by James George Frazer. Bonewits and Bonewits have claimed parallels in quantum physics. Benefits and dangers According to this law, contagion has both dangers and benefits. Benefits, for example, include that the holiness of a saint, god or other venerated figure confers benefits to relics, as do temples and churches, by virtue of their having religious rituals conducted within them. Psychics and mediums commonly utilize an object once owned by a missing or deceased subject as their \\"focus\\" for psychometry or clairvoyance or during séances. Dangers include, for example, a sorcerer or witch might acquire a lock of hair, nail clipping or scrap of clothing in order to facilitate a curse. Voodoo dolls resemble the victim and often incorporate hair or clothing from them. In cultures that practice sorcery individuals often exercise care that their hair or nails do not end up in the hands of sorcerers. Unconscious belief in the law of contagion Even among people who do not profess a belief in magic, psychological experiments have shown a reluctance on the part of the public to, say, try on a sweater worn by a serial murderer.

Cheyenne County occupied the region that today includes the City of Cheyenne, Wyoming. Cheyenne County was named for the Cheyenne Nation of Native Americans that lived in the area. History In July 1858, gold was discovered along the South Platte River in Arapahoe County, Kansas Territory. This discovery precipitated the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. Many residents of the mining region felt disconnected from the remote territorial governments of Kansas and Nebraska, so they voted to form their own Territory of Jefferson on October 24, 1859. On November 28, the General Assembly of the Territory of Jefferson organized 12 counties: Arrappahoe County, Cheyenne County, El Paso County, Fountain County, Heele County, Jackson County, Jefferson County, Mountain County, North County, Park County, Saratoga County, and St. Vrain's County. The legislation that created Cheyenne County declared: > That a county to be called Cheyenne, be and is hereby erected, including > that portion of territory lying within the following limits: commencing in > the main channel of the south fork of the Platte River, where the 104th > meridian of west longitude crosses the same, thence north with said 104 > meridian of longitude to where the same crosses Lodge Pole Creek, thence > west up the main channel of said creek to the summit of the Black Hills; > then south upon the summit of said Hills to the north west corner of Heele > county, thence east along the north line of said county to its north east > corner; thence south to the Cache La Poudre Creek, thence south down the > main channel of said creek to its junction with the South Platte River, > thence down the main channel of the Platte to the place of beginning.

It recounts the American Civil War through the viewpoint of Traveller, the favorite horse of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. Plot In his stable, Traveller, the favorite horse of retired Civil War general Robert E. Lee, relates the story of his life and experiences to his feline friend Tom. His narrative, meant to begin in the early spring of 1866, follows the events of the war as seen through a horse's eyes, from the time he was bought by General Lee in 1862 until Lee's death in 1870. At the end of the novel, Traveller, with undying faith in Lee, remains convinced that the Confederate Army beat the Union and that Lee is now \\"commander of the country\\" (versus his actual postbellum role as president of Washington University). Despite being led in Lee's funeral procession, Traveller does not understand that his master has died and will not return to ride again. Narrative style The main character, Traveller, relates his life story aloud to his friend Tom, a cat with whom he shares the barn. As such the entire narrative is written in a way meant to portray a Southern accent, reflecting Traveller's locality. The events of the war are told from the horse's point of view.

Competitive swimming Born in Brighton, Read began swimming relatively late at 14 years old. He joined Brighton Swimming Club in 1955 and became its youngest committee member in 1957. During the period from 1969 to 1971 he became a FINA judge, timekeeper, referee and starter and he remembers his time at the Edinburgh Commonwealth pool with great affection. English Schools champion, British Universities Champion, and second in the ASA National Championships in 1959, Read was selected to represent Great Britain in Swimming in the 1960 Olympic Games in Rome but unfortunately due to injury, was never able to compete. He joined the Channel Swimming Association (CSA) in 1969, making his first crossing that year and became a committee member in 1973. He was elected Vice Chairman from 1977–93 and Chairman of the CSA from 1993–1999. He joined the Board of Directors of the newly constituted CSA in 1999 and was elected Chairman. After a long struggle with the former King, Des Renford, he finally became King of the Channel in 1979 and took the record number of crossings from 17 to 31, with Des snatching back the 18th. Read retired from Channel swimming in 1984. Most of his training took place at the Ipswich lido: Broomhill, which was closed for many years but reopening is planned for 2020. Read briefly lost the title in 2000, having held it for 21 years, but regained the title in 2004 with his 33rd crossing. He is the only swimmer ever to have been awarded the title and the Letona Trophy 3 times. He has had a distinguished long-distance swimming career, competing in more than 120 swims over distances now termed \\"ultra marathon\\" swims and many more of the new marathon distance. Later years Unusually for an administrator he has continued to compete over a period of six decades, and still competes internationally in competitions up to 30 km. In his youth he competed in over 225 BLDSA events, won many BLDSA championships across the UK including the 1970 Windermere International, the Loch Ness Championship, set over 70 records and was the BLDSA Double Windermere Championship for nine consecutive years. In recent years he has also competed in the World, European and National Masters competitions. He has been the ASA National Masters 3 km champion on more than 10 occasions and runner-up four times. On one occasion when the event was held in Ullswater, he was second in the ASA 25 km; only two swimmers finished but he was judged out of time. He made a number of inaugural swims in the Scottish Lochs and the first ever two-way crossing of the Wash from Skegness to Hunstanton and back to Skegness. Among other firsts were the first ever three-way swim of Windermere and the first four-way swim. He was the first person to swim Loch Tay, Loch Rannoch, from Perth to Broughty Ferry and the 65 km from Mora to Amposta in the Ebro river. He was the second person to swim around the Isle of Wight. Honours Read was inducted into the International Marathon Swimming Hall of Fame in 1978 and has been made an Honorary citizen of both Nikiti in Greece and Dervio in Italy. In February 2009 he was awarded the International Swimming Hall of Fame Davids/Wheeler Memorial Award which recognises contributors to the administration of open water swimming worldwide. Read was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2012 New Year Honours for services to swimming. Records held *First person to complete a 3 way swim of Windermere (30.75 miles) on 20 July 1972. *First person to complete a 4 way swim of Windermere (41 miles) on 20 July 1972. *First person to swim Loch Tay (14 miles) in August 1973. *First person to swim Loch Lomond (21.6 miles) twice. *Most English Channel Swims in a Year by a man - 6 in 1979.

Indirect agonists work through varying mechanisms to achieve their effects, including transporter blockade, induction of transmitter release, and inhibition of transmitter breakdown. Mechanisms of indirect agonism Reuptake inhibition Cocaine is a monoamine transporter blocker and, thus, an indirect agonist of dopamine receptors. Cocaine binds the dopamine transporter (DAT), blocking the protein's ability to uptake dopamine from the synaptic cleft and also blocking DAT from terminating dopamine signaling. Blockage of DAT increases the extracellular concentration of dopamine, therefore increasing the amount of dopamine receptor binding and signaling. Dipyridamole inhibits reuptake of adenosine, resulting in greater extracellular concentrations of adenosine. Dipyridamole also inhibits the enzyme adenosine deaminase, the enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of adenosine. Evoking transmitter release Fenfluramine is an indirect agonist of serotonin receptors. Fenfluramine binds to the serotonin transporter, blocking serotonin reuptake. However, fenfluramine also acts to induce non-exocytotic serotonin release; in a mechanism similar to that of methamphetamine in dopamine neurons, fenfluramine binds to VMAT2, disrupting the compartmentalization of serotonin into vesicles and increasing the concentration of cytoplasmic serotonin available for drug-induced release.

PPX is a processive exophosphatase, which means that it begins at the ends of the polyphosphate chain and cleaves the phospho-anhydride bonds to release orthophosphate as it moves along the polyphosphate molecule. PPX has several characteristics which distinguish it from other known polyphosphatases, namely that it does not act on ATP, has a strong preference for long chain polyphosphate, and has a very low affinity for polyphosphate molecules with less than 15 phosphate monomers. PPX plays an important role in the metabolism of phosphate and energy in all living organisms. It is especially important for maintenance of appropriate levels of intracellular polyphosphate, which has been implicated in a variety of cellular functions including response to stressors such as deficiencies in amino acids, orthophosphate, or nitrogen, changes in pH, nutrient downshift, and high salt, and as an inorganic molecular chaperone. PPX is classified as a polyphosphatase, which are part of the large DHH phosphoesterase family. Both subfamilies within this super family share four N-terminus motifs but have different C-terminus moieties. PPX activity is quantified by measuring the loss of radioactively labeled 32P polyphosphate. PPX is mixed with a known quantity of labeled polyphosphate, and the hydrolysis reaction is stopped with perchloric acid (HClO4). The amount of remaining labeled polyphosphate is then measured by liquid scintillation counting. History PPX was discovered by the lab of Nobel laureate Arthur Kornberg in 1993 and is part of the polyphosphate operon along with polyphosphate kinase, the enzyme which synthesizes polyphosphate. The Kornberg lab was very interested in polyphosphate and published a series of papers elucidating the metabolism and roles of polyphosphate in vivo. Their interest in polyphosphate led them to identify and characterize the polyphosphate operon (which includes polyphosphate kinase [PPK] and PPX) and develop a wide variety of assays and techniques for quantification of polyphosphate production and degradation, in vitro and in vivo. The results of these studies of polyphosphate by the Kornberg lab led Kornberg to speculate that due to its high energy and phosphate content and the degree to which it is conserved across species, polyphosphate may have been the precursor to RNA, DNA, and proteins.  Structure  Structural characterization of the Ppx protein family: crystal structure of the Aquifex aeolicus family member. Active site is indicated by the binding of the chlorides (green) and the calcium ion (purple).1T6C The structure of PPX is characterized by the actin-like ATPase domain that is a part of this superfamily. In Aquifex aeolicus it contains a ribonuclease H-like motif that is made up of a five-stranded ß-sheet with the second strand antiparallel to the rest. A few of the strands are connected by helical segments that are longer in the C-terminal domain than in the N-terminal domain. Five alpha-helices are located in the C-terminal domain and only two are located in the N-terminal domain. The closed configuration of the enzyme is referred to as the type I structure. This configuration shares similar features to other members of this superfamily, including the N-terminal and C-terminal domains being separated by two alpha-helices centered on the structure. The more open arrangement of the domains displays rotational movement of the two domains around a single hinge region. The structural flexibility has been described as a \\"butterfly like\\" cleft opening around the active site. In E. coli, exopolyphosphatase exists as a dimer, with each monomer consisting of four domains. The first two domains consist of three beta-sheets followed by an alpha-beta-alpha-beta-alpha fold. This is different from the previously described Aquifex aeolicus homolog which lacks the third and fourth domains. To date, 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with Protein Data Bank accession codes 1T6C, 1T6D, 1U6Z, and 2FLO. 474x474px  Active Site  The active site of exopolyphosphatase is located in the clefts between domains I and II. In E. coli, this region contains a loop between strands beta-1 and beta-2 with the amino acids glutamate and aspartate (E121, D143, and E150). These residues, along with K197 are critical for phosphate binding and ion binding which is commonly seen among other ASKHA (acetate and sugar kinases, Hsp70, actin). In A. aeolicus, the active site of the enzyme exists in a cleft between the two domains. It is seen that catalytic carboxyl groups in this cleft are important for the enzyme activity, specifically Asp141 and Glu148. The preference of exopolyphosphatase to bind to polyphosphate and not ATP has been contributed to the clashing that would occur between the ribose and adenosine of ATP and the side chains of N21, C169, and R267.  Mechanism  Exopolyphosphatase cleaves a terminal phosphate off of polyphosphate through the amino acid side chains of glutamate and lysine. Glutamate activates water, allowing it to act as a nucleophile and attack the terminal phosphate. The oxygen that was previously bridging the two phosphate atoms then abstracts a hydrogen from the nearby lysine residue. 450x450px Function Polyphosphates are utilized by exopolyphosphatase enzymes, which cleave portions of the chain of phosphates. These proteins play an essential role in the metabolism and maintenance of polyphosphates. Polyphosphate is located throughout the cytosol of each cell and is also present in the cell's organelles. There are many classes of exopolyphosphatases, each with their own unique localization and properties. It has been speculated that once the polyphosphates are broken down, they are involved with signaling molecules acting as secondary messengers. In E. coli, the regulation of polyphosphate metabolism is poorly understood. Polyphosphate is a linear chain of phosphates linked together by phosphoanhydride bonds. Polyphosphate is found in all living organisms and plays an essential role in the organisms survival. In bacteria, polyphosphate is used to store energy to replace adenosine triphosphate. It has also been shown to be involved with cell membrane formation and function, enzyme regulation, and gene transcriptional control. In mammals, polyphosphates are involved with blood coagulation and inflammation, immune response, bone tissue development, and brain function. It has been shown in a yeast model that mutant yeast deficient in exopolyphosphatase activity had problems in respiration functions and metabolism of inorganic polyphosphates. Conversely, yeast strains that have higher levels exopolyphosphatase enzyme are shown to have no obvious growth defects under phosphate deficiency or excess phosphate conditions, however the level of polyphosphate in the yeast was much lower due to the increased number of enzymes breaking the polyphosphate chains down. Potential Clinical/Industrial Relevance E. coli mutants which are unable to synthesize polyphosphate die after only a few days in stationary phase. Strategies to inhibit polyphosphate accumulation in bacteria are therefore of interest as potential antibacterial treatments. This can be accomplished via inhibition of polyphosphate kinase, enhancement of exopolyphosphatase activity, or both. Polyphosphate accumulation is also of interest for a variety of industrial applications including removal of Pi from aquatic environments via enhanced biological phosphorus removal and for its role as a molecular chaperone in expression of recombinant protein. Because of the activity of polyphosphate as a molecular chaperone, strains of E. coli which accumulate polyphosphate could be used to increase yield of soluble recombinant protein.

Kentucky passed legislation in 1976 allowing wineries to operate, and tobacco settlement funds have provided Kentucky farmers the opportunity to once again explore grapes as a cash crop. History One of the first attempts at large-scale commercial viticulture in the United States started in Kentucky in 1799, with plantings by the Kentucky Vineyard Society. The relatively mild climate of Kentucky, especially in the Ohio River Valley, made Kentucky an attractive place for early American winemaking. By the mid-19th century, Kentucky was the third largest wine-producing state in the country.

He was an author of symphonic and vocal symphonic music, choir music, vocal chamber music, cantatas, oratories and operas; contemporary picaresque novels and short stories. He is considered to be the first representative of the Postmodern style in Latvian literature. Biography His father was a choir conductor, organist and organ builder. He completed his primary education at , by which time he was already performing as an organist. After 1925, he attended the then, in 1928, studied organ, piano and composition at the Riga Conservatory. He slowly gained recognition as a composer while working as a teacher and a librarian. Following the Soviet Occupation, he was appointed musical director at the Dailes Theatre (1940–1950), and served as chairman of the Latvian Composers' Union (1951–1952, 1956–1968). He was also the Director of the Latvian National Symphony Orchestra for the 1951–1952 season. Although he was forced to compose in the acceptable Soviet musical styles, he attempted to experiment whenever possible. Toward the end of the 1960s, he turned to writing. In 1969, the journal Literature and Art published his first novel: The Champs Elysées Mozart. His best known novel, Viltotais Fausts jeb pārlabota un papildināta pavārgrāmata (translated as Mock Faustus) came out in 1973. From 1956 to 1968, he was Chairman of the . Works His musical output is large and diverse. His best works display a theatrically concrete, striking imagination, expressive modifications of style and genre, artistic skill, and exceptionally diverse forms of humour. He composed five operas (of which four have been performed at the Latvian National Opera), two musical comedies, vocal- orchestral works, six concertos, chamber song-cycles, organ music, music for theatre and film, and over 100 songs for choir, including ten song-cycles. In the post-war period he maintained and developed the approach to folklore that had already appeared in the choral arrangements of the younger generation of composers in the 1930s, mainly in the works of Volfgangs Dārziņš and Jānis Kalniņš. More than his predecessors, however, he chose to develop the elements of dance, humour and play found in folk music. From 1960s he represents stylistically vivid, sometimes paradoxical forms of musical expression and widely to use stylization, quotations and musical allusions in various ways. This new vision brought with it freedom of thought and served to erode the standardized aesthetics and dogmatic thought which formed the cornerstone of Soviet ideology.

The scales and weighing machines produced at the Fishponds foundry on Parnall Road included the hardy Patent Agate Hand Scales and the Patent National Balances invented by Mr Parnall, which sold 20,000 in 10 years. In 1889 the company expanded into shopfronts, including glasswork and iron architecture and had over 400 employees. By the 1890s \\"there is hardly a city or town in Great Britain where their productions are not known and appreciated\\".Histories of Bristol Companies: Parnalls of Fishponds Retrieved on 26 November 2007. Weighing machine production was phased out after W & T Avery Ltd. was associated and the company concentrated on its well-known shop- front business. The foundry was later sold to George Adlam & Sons the iron founders and brewers engineers. During the First World War the company started manufacture of aeroplanes and seaplanes, producing over 600 by 1918. George Geach Parnall left the company soon afterwards, who eventually went on to form Parnall Aircraft Ltd and successfully continued aircraft design and manufacture elsewhere in Bristol. Between the wars In 1923, Parnall & Sons Ltd moved to Lodge Causeway, Fishponds, in Bristol into a former factory of the Cosmos Engineering aeroengines company.The Transport Archives: Brazil Straker Building – Fishponds Retrieved on 27 November 2007. The company resumed manufacture of shopfronts, including the bronze shopfronts and display cases in Piccadilly Circus tube station and steel canopies at the Savoy Hotel and the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford-on-Avon. High-profile work included the internal fittings for passenger liners, including the outfit of the Tourist class dining room on the RMS Britannic built at Harland & Wolff for the White Star Line in the late 1920s. In addition they also branched out into refrigerated and cold storage units, executive office furniture, and gained expertise in the fabrication of plastics leading to the formation of a plastics division. The Second World War Tiger Moth wings were built by Parnall & Sons Once again the Air Ministry turned to the company for aircraft manufacturing, and the factory in Fishponds produced airframe components and fuselage sections in metal and wood for a range of RAF and FAA aircraft. Manufacture throughout the war years included wings for De Havilland Tiger Moth and Airspeed Oxford trainers, wing flaps for Fairey Barracuda torpedo-bombers and Handley Page Halifax heavy bombers, fuselages for Shorts Stirling heavy bombers and Airspeed Horsa gliders, and tail planes for Bristol Beaufighter heavy fighter. Post war Similar aircraft component work also continued after the war with contracts for the manufacture of fuselages in the late 1940s and 50s for the de Havilland Venom, a jet single-seat fighter- bomber. Work continued with interior finishings for Bristol Britannia airliners up until 1960, which then exploited the new materials available, such as plastic. In the late 1940s, the company turned its hand to supplying the new supermarket industry, producing metal shelving and display units. Fittings contracts continued in the luxury market including contracts for 10 Downing Street, Buckingham Palace, the Houses of Parliament. Most famous of all was the production and installation of the internal fittings for public rooms on board the Cunard Ocean Liner QE 2 in 1960s. In 1979, Parnall & Sons was bought by GEC, who subsequently sold the company to CH Holdings.

Remarkable as well are the abstract floral patterns that cover all the interior walls outside the frescos as well as the gilded pulpit.  Architectural Style  As the architect predominantly used the round arch, this building is clearly neo-romanesque. Using 19th- century building materials and techniques it was possible to create much larger windows, compared to monuments from the original Romanesque period.

Gothic elements can be found in the pointed arches of altar and pulpit, nevertheless, they form a harmonious whole with the entire building.  frescos  The vaulted ceiling is graced by images of the Nativity and the Resurrection of Christ. Immediately above the altar, the Holy Trinity is depicted, surrounded by the Virgin Mary, the prophets of the Old Testament, the four evangelists, and the community of the faithful. The choir to the left and right of the altar contains two frescoes: Christ is shown entering Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, and the Lazarus is shown resurrected. The artist managed to arrange a noteworthy interaction of natural light and his painting in the left side of the choir, depicting Jesus' entrance into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday. Around noon, rays of sunlight reach the Messiah and the disciples immediately surrounding him. In contrast, those waiting for him with their perfectly understandable, yet earthly wishes and needs—with sometimes desperate hope—are for the time being shrouded in shadow.

For example, in the context of oncology, an MRI scan may reveal the shape and size of a tumor, while an MRSI study provides additional information about the metabolic activity occurring in the tumor. MRSI can be performed on a standard MRI scanner, and the patient experience is the same for MRSI as for MRI. MRSI has broad applications in medicine, including oncology and general physiological studies. When hydrogen is the target element, MRSI is also called 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging. MRSI can also be performed with phosphorus, or hyperpolarized carbon-13.

It is the oldest Polish Roman Catholic Church within the city and Archdiocese of Philadelphia. The church building was closed at the end of March 2014 due to structural issues, and all religious functions were relocated to Holy Name of Jesus Church, 2 blocks away. St. Laurentius Catholic School, while merging with Holy Name of Jesus Parish School, remains open. There are plans for the church to be demolished. History The building has Gothic spires and stained glass windows. Its origins date back to a time when pious, but poor, immigrants sought a house of worship. In the late 19th century, Catholic Polish people in the area desired a parish. Early religious services were held in the basement of St. Boniface Church on Diamond and Hancock Streets, and later, at Norris and Sepviva Streets. Neighborhood children received catechism lessons at a nearby blacksmith shop. With fewer than fifty devoted family followers and only US$31.50 in the treasury, the Polish people petitioned Archbishop of Philadelphia James F. Wood for a church. In 1882 a house of worship was established. St. Laurentius Church was named (in Latin) after St. Lawrence, a deacon who was martyred under the reign of Roman Emperor Valerian. Church services began in a modest basement facility at Berks and Memphis Streets. Children began attending school there in 1890, under the instruction of the Felician Sisters, a Polish order of nuns. The first Polish-speaking priest at St. Laurentius Church, Father Adalbert Malusecki, led efforts to build the church's upper chapel. Architect Edwin Forrest Durang constructed a Gothic- style décor for the sanctuary, which is 114 feet long, 60 feet wide, with three naves. Master craftsmen from Mannheim, Germany were called upon to build an ornate wooden altar, pulpit, statues and elaborate cut-glass windows. Later, in 1912, under the stewardship of Father Gabriel Kraus, the sanctuary was embellished with oil paintings portraying the life of Christ and his Saints. After the upper church was built, two small homes adjoining the church were purchased and demolished, and a rectory was built. In 1897, under Father Gabriel Kraus, two more properties were purchased for extra classroom space and the construction of a Sisters’ Convent. In 1899 the school was officially dedicated in a celebration attended by members of Polish lodges from around the Delaware Valley, Bishop Edmond F. Prendergast blessed the building, which was adorned with American and Polish flags. During Father Karus's 25 years of service improvements were made to the church. In 1919, an elaborate pipe organ was installed. In 1923, when school attendance was steadily increasing, a new school building was erected. The three-story schoolhouse has enough space for 14 classrooms, and more than 350 students. During this time, the school was officially listed on the register of Philadelphia parochial schools. Archbishop Dennis Cardinal Dougherty blessed the new building. As St. Laurentius School's attendance increased in the mid-1920s, Father Julian G. Zagorski, then assistant at the church, founded the Catholic Young Men's Club. With a focus on athletics the club promoted good sportsmanship and fostered Catholic fellowship among neighborhood boys. The Great Depression caused financial difficulty, but after fund-raising the church's financial debt was alleviated. Enrollment at St. Laurentius School continued to increase. By 1938 nearly 800 children were enrolled. Improvements were made in the 1950s and 1960s, including new heating in the school and rectory. A new convent was erected for the Felician Sisters. Under Father Garstka's leadership a Boy Scouts of America troop was founded in 1956, and the Catholic Ladies Guild was formed for fund-raising. A newspapers called The Parish Calendar was set up in 1957. Karol Cardinal Wojtyla, Archbishop of Kraków, Poland, became Pope John Paul II in 1978, succeeding John Paul I. He visited Philadelphia on October 4, 1979. The Church's 100th year Jubilee was celebrated 1982. In the mid-1990s the Archdiocese of Philadelphia began to lose parishioners as fewer Catholics attended Mass on a regular basis. Father Frank Gwiazda, appointed in 1986, was faced with raising declining enrollment at St. Laurentius School. After Holy Name School, St. Anne's School and several other Catholic schools closed in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Saint Laurentius Parish and Fr. Frank Gwiazda welcomed all children to St. Laurentius School. It is being recognized for working with The University of Pennsylvania, for a well qualified staff and for the growth its student show both academically and emotionally. In 2013, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, prompted by financial troubles both centrallyhttp://articles.philly.com/2013-07-04/news/40353788_1_archdiocese- archbishop-charles-j-timothy-o-shaughnessy and at many parishes, as well as a declining number of clergy to staff parishes, announced the closing of numerous parishes effective July 1. St. Laurentius was among those parishes; it was suppressed as an independent parish effective July 2013. It became a worship site of Holy Name of Jesus Church, also in Fishtown, about 0.2 mile away. At the time, plans were to keep the building at St. Laurentius open as a worship site of the expanded Holy Name Parish;http://catholicphilly.com/2013/06/local-news/local-catholic- news/parishes-in-four-regions-of-philadelphia-archdiocese-to-merge-july-1/ this status would allow the use of the church building for periodic Sunday Masses and special celebrations such as weddings and funeralshttp://archphila.org/conversion/BuildingaNewParishCommunityManualApril2013.pdf [Appendix B-1] On Saturday, March 29, 2014, the St. Laurentius church building was closed indefinitely due to severe structural problems that left it \\"in immediate danger of collapse\\". Independent building inspectors, who had observed deterioration in the brownstone masonry in the fall of 2013, found in a follow-up visit at the end of March that this deterioration had greatly accelerated during the winter, and recommended immediate closure of the structure. All services were moved to Holy Name of Jesus Parish nearby on Gaul Street while the Archdiocese of Philadelphia determined the fate of the building. On Sunday, March 22, 2015, the Archdiocese revealed that they would go forward with demolishing St. Laurentius due to an excess of $3.5 million in repairs and accelerated structural deterioration due to previous weather conditions. The cost of the demolition is estimated to be $1 million and will be borne by Holy Name Parish which took ownership of St. Laurentius when it became a worship site of Holy Name before its closure. The money will be raised by selling unutilized buildings on the parish campus, according to CatholicPhilly, which also said that the decision would not affect the St. Laurentius School, which will continue to operate. On Friday, July 10, 2015, the Philadelphia Historical Commission voted overwhelmingly to grant the 19th- century building historic status in a decision that will protect Fishtown's St. Laurentius Roman Catholic Church from demolition - at least temporarily.

MEM is part of a group of small round blue cell tumors which includes neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and the Ewing's family of tumors .  Typical Pathology  Small Blue Round Cell Tumor under a microscope Malignant ectomesenchymomas may form in the head and neck, abdomen, perineum, scrotum, or limbs. The tumor is defined by its heterologous rhabdomyoblastic components. MEM histology is that of an elongated cell with an embryonic morphology Holland, James F.; Frei III, Emil; Weichselbaum, Ralph R.; Bast, Robert C.; Gansler, Ted S.; Kufe, Donald W.; Pollock, Raphael E., eds. (2003), \\"Resemblance to embryonal tissue\\", Holland-Frei Cancer Medicine (6th ed.), Hamilton, Ontario, Canada: BC Decker, , OCLC 53895425, retrieved 3 Dec 2011. Onset time is relatively rapid and occurs early in life with the average age of onset is 0.6 years of age. However, children have been known to develop MEM up until they reach 5 years old. The neuroectodermal component has the potential to display any neuroblastic tumor including neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroblastoma, and ganglion cells with or without schwannian stroma. The rhabdomyoblastic component is derived from pluripotent migratory neural crest cells . The nature and wide migration patterns of neural crest cells allow them to give rise to both neural and non-nervous tissue including neurons, glia, smooth muscle, and melanocytes. Patients have the potential to display primary tumors in various locations prior to metastasis making this cancer particularly complicated.  Differing Representations Across Patients  Unfortunately, heterogenous tumors have the potential to represent further heterogeneity between patients. Because of the rarity of cases, in 2014 there were only 64 cases reported in the literature, most studies of ectomesenchymoma are limited by very small cohort sizes. In an investigation of six cases, researchers attempted to create a profile for the different presentations in ectomesenchymomal tumors. Mesenchymal elements, represented by rhabdomyosarcoma, were the dominant component in the majority of cases (5/6) while embryonal and alveolar morphology had equal distribution (3/6). Patients with the alveolar subtype harbored the characteristic translocations including translocation of the FOXO1 gene fusing with the PAX3 or PAX7 gene. In the neuroectodermal component of the tumors, neuroblastic neoplasm was the most common presentation (4/6) and the other two cases represented a primitive neuroectodermal tumor-like morphology.  Genetic Factors  Several translocations and genetic markers have been identified as possible oncogenic transformations in ectomesenchymoma: * FOXO1 fusion with PAX3 or PAX7 in alveolar expression * Chromosome amplification of 6p21.32-p21.2 and 6p11.2 in embryonal RMS expression ** Concurrent with increased expression of HMGA1 and HMGA2 proteins Treatment with chemotherapy led to a reduction in amplification of 6p21.32-p21.2 and 6p11.2 leading to rescue of HMGA1 and HMGA2 protein expression .  History  The first records of ectomesenchymoma are from 1971 in an investigation into neoplasms of mixed mesenchymal and neuroepithelial origin. In the same year another research group identified gangliorhabdomyosarcoma originating from the ectomesenchyme. The term ectomesenchymoma was first termed in 1977 to refer to a facial tumor found in a 6 month old female. This tumor persisted with evidence of regrowth 8 months after extensive debulking, triple chemotherapy, and radiation treatment. Biopsical investigation identified four different phenotypes present in the tumor and all were originally derived from the neural crest cell lineage. The varied nature of these tumors sparked questions about the transformational factors which lead to cancerous expression across multiple mature cell types. A publication in 2017 was the first to identify FOX01 gene rearrangements in ectomesemchymoma.  Treatment & Complications  Current treatment options for ectomesenchymomas are limited to traditional therapies as reported in the literature. Typical treatment options include chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgical debulking when possible. Lack of specific therapies has the potential to cause discomfort and damage to the patient. Because most of the effected population of ectomesenchymoma are juveniles, the long term carcinogenic and developmental risk of radiation therapy is fairly high. Risk of development of leukemia and thyroid cancers also increases significantly with cancer treatment . Another major concern for chemotherapy and radiotherapy, particularly in the central nervous system and brain, is the potential developmental impacts.

Hee Seo and Roberto Bolle, 28 June 2014 Derek Deane, the English National Ballet director, created two productions for him: Swan Lake and Romeo and Juliet, both of them performed at the Royal Albert Hall in London. On the 10th anniversary of the Opera Theatre in Cairo, he performed in Aida at the pyramids of Giza and afterwards at the Arena in Verona for a new version of the opera live worldwide. In October 2000 he opened the season at Covent Garden Opera House in London performing Swan Lake, and in November he was invited by the Bolshoi Ballet to celebrate Maya Plisetskaya's 75th anniversary in the presence of President Vladimir Putin. In June 2002, on the occasion of Queen Elizabeth's Golden Jubilee, he danced the Swan Lake Act III pas de deux with Royal Ballet principal dancer Zenaida Yanowsky in the ballroom at Buckingham Palace in the presence of the Queen. The event was broadcast live by BBC and transmitted to all the Commonwealth countries. During the 2003-2004 season he was promoted to Étoile of La Scala Theatre. On 1 April 2004 he danced in front of Pope John Paul II in St. Peter's Square to celebrate young people's day. On 7 December, to celebrate the re-opening of La Scala Theatre after its restoration, he danced Europa riconosciuta with Alessandra Ferri and three weeks later in the New Year’s Eve Star Gala. In December 2005 at Covent Garden Opera House in London he performed Frederick Ashton’s production of Sylvia, broadcast by the BBC on Christmas Day. Bolle danced at the opening ceremony of the 2006 Winter Olympic Games in Turin where he performed a solo created for him by Enzo Cosimi. The ceremony was broadcast worldwide and seen by 2.5 billion people. In 2007 he performed for the first time with ABT as a guest artist, on the occasion of Alessandra Ferri’s farewell performance. For the 2009 spring season at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City, Bolle performed as a principal dancer with the American Ballet Theatre: the first time that a male Italian dancer joined the company as a principal. The \\"Dance Listings\\" in the New York Times on 26 June 2009 described Bolle as \\"utterly gorgeous (in both looks and dance).\\" Bolle’s Spring 2010 American Ballet Theatre performances include The Lady of the Camellias, Swan Lake, La Bayadère, and Romeo and Juliet.

Despite being a South Korean production, the film's principal cast consists of Western actors such as Harrison Young, Donna Phillipson, Richard B. Livingston, Briant Wells, Brad Sergi, Dan Cashman, and Bruce Cornwell. Yonggary was released in South Korea on July 17, 1999. An alternative cut was later released with an altered plot and updated special effects on January 20, 2001 as Yonggary: 2001 Upgrade Edition, which was distributed in North America as Reptilian. The film was considered the most expensive South Korean film produced at the time of its release. Plot Based on the 2001 version; the 1999 version has never been released on home video on any market. In Southeast Asia, Dr. Campbell and Dr. Hughes lead an archaeological party exploring caverns. Hughes is separated and finds an alien corpse with a fossilized diamond while Campbell uncovers hieroglyphics leading to the location of a dinosaur skeleton. Two years later, an alien mothership arrives near Earth’s orbit and destroy two American satellites that get the attention of soldier Parker, who reports it to General Murdock of the United National Defense Agency (UNDA). Bud Black, a photojournalist, learns about a dinosaur dig, led by Campbell, along with his assistant Holly. Hughes, who has been believed to be dead for the last two years, arrives at the dig site to warn Campbell about the dinosaur's resurrection, but is quickly removed from the site. The alien ship sends beams to reanimate the dinosaur, killing several diggers. Holly confronts Campbell about the mysterious deaths and quits after Campbell refuses to launch an investigation. Hughes finds Holly and reveals to her about the legend of Yonggary, the alien fossil, additional hieroglyphics, and that he was held by the U.S. government as a \\"guest\\" for the last two years. She initially dismisses his claims, but comes around after he shows her classified data concerning the alien fossil. They return to the dig site to stop Campbell, but arrive too late when the alien ship fully resurrects Yonggary, killing Campbell in the process. The alien ship dematerializes Yonggary and Holly and Hughes are taken into custody by Parker. Yonggary is then teleported before them and escape before a helicopter squadron engage Yonggary in battle, only to be defeated. The National Space Investigation Agency (NSIA) send Stanley Mills to share information regarding the aliens with General Murdock and General Howell. Mills explains that a paleontologist provided the NSIA with scientific evidence that an alien civilization visited the Earth 200 million years ago and that vital information in defeating the aliens was stolen. Mills recommends to capture the aliens alive, but Howell wishes to destroy them. Yonggary is then teleported to Los Angeles and proceeds to attack. Upon arriving at the UNDA base, Hughes and Holly are confronted by Mills, who reveals that Hughes was the paleontologist who shared his discoveries and later stole information from their lab. Hughes counters that he warned the NSIA but chose to ignore him. Mills attempts to take the stolen data disc back but fails and is detained. The US President gives the UNDA five hours to defeat Yonggary or will launch a nuclear strike. Murdock orders General Thomas to dispatch his experimental Project T Forces, led by Parker, to attack Yonggary. Hughes and Holly decode the additional hieroglyphics and uncover that the aliens are controlling Yonggary through a diamond-shaped receptor on his forehead and that \\"another great light will be sent to do battle.\\" Failing to defeat Yonggary in time, the President sends a bomber to kill Yonggary, to the delight of Mills. The T-Forces manage to break the aliens’ control over Yonggary. Mills tries to convince Murdock to kill him but is ignored, which forces Mills to jam the UNDA's radars unless they let him leave. Mills fails and is arrested. The aliens send a new monster, Cykor, to battle Yonggary. Cykor initially gets the upper hand, but Yonggary emerges victorious in the end, forcing the aliens to flee. The generals manage to stop the bomber at the last minute and the following morning, the UNDA transports Yonggary to a deserted island. Cast Production Suits were produced and used during filming but were replaced with CGI during post-production. In addition to receiving financial support from the Hyundai Capital Corp. and Korean Technology Finance Corp., the film received financial and technical support from the Korean government (and the government of Suwon) by allowing the filmmakers access to military bases, hardware, and locations such as the Historic War Museum in Seoul, a location where filming has never been permitted before.Yonggary (2001) Production Notes - Colombia TriStar DVD Release The film utilized 124 miniatures and the designers spent 6 months designing Yonggary. Sculptures of the monsters were made in 6 months which were then scanned to digital screens for 3D work. Suits were produced for the monsters but were replaced with computer-generated imagery during post-production. The film was in production for 18 months and resulted in 45 minutes of computer graphics. 2001 Upgrade Edition After the film's successful opening, the filmmakers decided to expand the film with additional CG effects, new sets, a slightly different story, and additional characters, and began reshooting in December 1999. This version would later be released in early 2001 as Yonggary: 2001 Upgrade Edition and as Reptilian for its North American home video release. Release Posters used at Cannes in 1998 Marketing In 1998, a two-minute preview titled Yonggary 1998 was produced and shown at the Cannes Film Festival for potential international distributors, which generated interest from Warner Bros. and United International Pictures. Before entering production, the film was pre-sold at $2.72 million after signing nine contracts of copyrights with Germany, Poland, Thailand, Turkey, and others. Yonggary was given coverage in magazines that were published during the festival. Theatrical Yonggary was released in South Korea on July 17, 1999. The film opened at the Korean Culture Center in Seoul, the first time a film premiered at the center, and sold 120,000 admissions on its opening day and 1 million admissions during its opening weekend. The film was released in 85 theaters in South Korea, the highest number for any movie released in South Korea at the time. The film was considered the most expensive South Korean film produced at the time of its release. The film was later re-released on January 20, 2001 with updated special effects and an altered plot as Yonggary: 2001 Upgrade Edition; however, the re-release was a critical and commercial flop. Home media The 2001 version was released on DVD by Columbia Tristar on August 21, 2001 as Reptilian. Columbia Tristar later released the film on VHS on March 5, 2002. Reception Chuck Arrington from DVD Talk gave the film a mixed review, criticizing the film's acting and dialogue, calling it \\"painful\\", but also wrote that the film was funny enough to merit renting it. StompTokyo.com gave the film a negative review, criticizing the film's poor quality special effects, calling it \\"cartoonish\\". In his book VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever, Jim Craddock awarded the film one out of four bones, noting that the film should have ended once the military defeats Yonggary. An anonymous reviewer in Fangoria declared the film as being so inept that the film had made as purposely intentionally awful with special effects that resembled a disappointing video game.

Biography  Qasim Barid was a Muslim (Shia) Turk domiciled in Safavid Georgia. He entered the service of the Bahmani sultan Muhammad Shah III and later became the prime-minister of the Bahmani sultanate. According to the third edition of the Encyclopaedia of Islam, he was a Sunni Turk.  As Vizier  Qasim Barid I led one of the first revolts against the Bahmani Sultanate.

Logan was named head coach at Loyola on May 12, 2005, after spending the previous four seasons (2001–2005) as a women's basketball assistant coach at St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia. Logan, a 1996 graduate of Loyola, was also an assistant coach at Loyola from 1997–2001 under Pat Coyle and Cindy Griffin. Following his graduation, Logan spent a season as a men's basketball assistant coach at Centenary College, an NCAA Division III school in Hackettstown, New Jersey. During his time as a student at Loyola, Logan was a manager for both the men's and women's basketball teams. He was with each team when they advanced to the NCAA Tournaments (men, 1994; women, 1995) and served under former Loyola coaches Skip Prosser and Coyle. Logan returned to Loyola to help rebuild the Greyhounds, and he has done an admirable job at that. In 2005–2006, the Greyhounds compiled a 20–10 record, the most victories by a first-year head coach in school history. Loyola advanced to the MAAC Championship Game that year before losing to Marist. The 2006–2007 Greyhounds put together an 18–12 mark and moved on to the MAAC Semifinals despite being projected to finish seventh in the conference prior to the season. Logan was named the Anaconda Sports/MAAC Coach of the Year following that season. Following the graduation of eight players over two years, the Greyhounds entered a bit of a rebuilding process in 2007–2008. Logan, however, helped the team jump out to a 7–2 record before finishing the season 13–17 in the MAAC Quarterfinals. In 2008–2009, the Greyhounds finished 10–20. Logan led the Greyhounds to arguably the most successful season in program history in 2010–11, tying the record for most wins in a single season with 21, and setting the mark for most conference wins with 15. Loyola finished 21–13 overall and 15–3 in the MAAC to finish second in the regular season. During the 2010–11 campaign, Loyola won nine-straight games, tying the record for the longest winning streak in program history. The Greyhounds went on to the MAAC title game for the seventh time in school history, where they fell to Marist. Loyola qualified for the 2011 Women's National Invitation Tournament, where they picked up the program's first-ever postseason win, knocking off Old Dominion 67-65 on the road. During the 2011-12 season, Logan reached a pair of career milestones. First, he won his 100th career game with a win over George Washington, becoming just the second head women's basketball coach at Loyola to accomplish the feat. Logan then became the all-time wins leader as coach in Greyhound history on January 7, 2012, recording his 101st career win over Siena. Loyola went on to finish fourth in the MAAC during 2011–12, going 13–17 overall and 9–9 in the MAAC. Logan is married to former Loyola women's basketball player and assistant coach, Susan Bryce.

Lung cancer and breast cancer account for about 50-65% of malignant pleural effusions. Other common causes include pleural mesothelioma and lymphoma. Diagnosis Clinical evaluation Clinical factors predicting the diagnosis of malignant pleural effusions are symptoms lasting more than 1 month and the absence of fever. Imaging This is needed to confirm the presence of a pleural effusion. Chest radiograph is usually performed first and may demonstrate an underlying lung cancer as well as the pleural effusion. Ultrasound has a sensitivity of 73% and specificity of 100% at distinguishing malignant pleural effusions from other causes of pleural effusion, based on the presence of visible pleural metastases, pleural thickening greater than 1 cm, pleural nodularity, diaphragmatic thickening measuring greater than 7mm and an echogenic swirling pattern visible in the pleural fluid. Biochemical analysis Malignant pleural effusions are exudates. A low pleural fluid pH is associated with poorer survival and reduced pleurodesis efficacy. Histopathology Pleural fluid cytology is positive in 60% of cases. However, in the remaining cases, pleural biopsy is required. Image guided biopsy and thoracoscopy have largely replaced blind biopsy due to their greater sensitivity and safety profile. CT guided biopsy has a sensitivity of 87% compared to Abrams' needle biopsy, which has a sensitivity of 47%. Biomarkers Identification of pleural fluid biomarkers to distinguish malignant pleural effusions from other causes of exudative effusions would help diagnosis. Biomarkers that have been shown to be raised in malignant pleural effusions compared to benign disease include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), endostatin, matrix metalloproteinases and tumour markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen. Pleural fluid mesothelin has a sensitivity of 71%, greater than that of cytology, and a specificity of 89% for the diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma. Treatment The goal of treatment of malignant pleural effusions is relief of shortness of breath. Occasionally, treatment of the underlying cancer can cause resolution of the effusion. This may be the case with types of cancer that respond well to chemotherapy, such as small cell carcinoma or lymphoma. Simple aspiration of pleural fluid can relieve shortness of breath rapidly but fluid and symptoms will usually recur within a couple of weeks. Drainage should generally be done under ultrasound guidance. For this reason, more permanent treatments are usually used to prevent fluid recurrence. Standard treatment involves inserting an indwelling plural catheter and pleurodesis. However, this treatment requires an inpatient stay of approximately 2–7 days, can be painful and has a significant failure rate. This has led to the development of tunneled pleural catheters (e.g., Pleurx Catheters), which allow outpatient treatment of effusions. If an infection due to the catheter occurs, antibiotics are given and the catheter is generally left in. A Cochrane review concluded tentatively in favour of thoracoscopy to remove the fluid and blow talc into the pleural cavity (talc poudrage) compared to other commonly used methods.

The county seat was Colorado City. History In July 1858, gold was discovered along the South Platte River in Arapahoe County, Kansas Territory. This discovery precipitated the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. Many residents of the mining region felt disconnected from the remote territorial governments of Kansas and Nebraska, so they voted to form their own Territory of Jefferson on October 24, 1859. On November 28, the General Assembly of the Territory of Jefferson organized 12 counties: Arrappahoe County, Cheyenne County, El Paso County, Fountain County, Heele County, Jackson County, Jefferson County, Mountain County, North County, Park County, Saratoga County, and St. Vrain's County. The legislation that created El Paso County declared: > That the territory comprised within the following limits be erected into a > county to be called El Paso county: commencing in the main channel of the > south fork of Platte River, at the south west corner of Arrappahoe county, > thence easterly on the main divide between the head waters of the Arkansas > and Platte Rivers twenty-five miles; thence south seventy-five miles; thence > west to the summit of the Rocky Mountains; thence northwardly on the said > range to the south Platte River, thence down the main channel of said stream > to the place of beginning. El Paso County was named for the Spanish language name for Ute Pass north of Pikes Peak. The Jefferson Territory never received federal sanction, but on February 28, 1861, U.S. President James Buchanan signed an act organizing the Territory of Colorado. On November 1, 1861, the Colorado General Assembly organized 17 counties, including El Paso County and Pueblo County, for the new Colorado Territory.

The following July, when the App Store launched, it was among the first 552 apps available for iPhone. It was then released alongside the iPad in 2010, and became one of the first apps available for Apple Watch in 2015. In December 2013, Cultured Code announced that they had sold one million copies of the software to date, and in December 2014 the company announced that downloads had increased by an additional three million.  Awards  Things has won multiple awards over the years. It first won the MacLife Editors' Choice Award in 2008, and then in 2009 it went on to win the Apple Design Award, the Macworld Editors' Choice Award, and the Macworld Best of Show Award. In 2012, after the release of Things 2, Apple selected it as Editors' Choice, named it among the App Store Best of 2012, and inducted it into the App Store Hall of Fame. Things won the Apple Design Award again with the release of Things 3 in 2017. In 2018, thanks to its innovative implementation of external keyboard support, Things for iPad won the MacStories Selects Award for Best App Update of the year.  Features   Main features  Things allows to-dos to be subdivided into several sections, which roughly correspond to parts of the Getting Things Done methodology: = Collect = *Inbox is used to temporarily collect to-dos which have not been filed into a specific list yet. = Organize = *Projects are collections of to-dos that contribute to the completion of a larger goal (e.g., \\"Plan Holiday\\"). A project can be subdivided with headings. Once the project is finished, the user marks it complete and it moves to the Logbook with all the to-dos it contains. *Areas can be used to group together projects and to-dos which correspond to the same, ongoing theme (e.g., \\"Work\\" or \\"Family\\"). Unlike projects, areas are perpetual, do not have a checkbox, and are never completed. = Schedule = *Today automatically collects to-dos which are due, or scheduled to begin, from all the user's lists into one centralized place; they are the user's priorities for the current day. **This Evening is a separate section at the bottom of Today where the user can set aside to-dos they don't plan to do until later in the evening. *Upcoming contains to-dos and projects that have been postponed to a specific date, as well as to-dos that are automatically generated based on repeating patterns chosen by the user. *Anytime is an overview of active to-dos from across all of the user's projects and areas (i.e., to-dos not scheduled for a later date, or postponed in Someday). *Someday is used to store to-dos which need to be done, but are not time critical (or are on hold).  Additional features  *Calendar integration allows the user to see their calendar events alongside their to- dos in the Today and Upcoming lists. *Reminders integration allows the user to import to-dos from Apple's Reminders app into their Things inbox. *Quick Entry is an extension on the Mac that allows the user to create to-dos while working in other apps. Activated by a global keyboard shortcut, it invokes a small pop-up window which can automatically include links to files or websites. *Add to Things is an extension on iPhone and iPad that, like Quick Entry, allows the user to send to-dos to Things from other apps. The new to-do is saved to Things' inbox in the background. *Siri integration allows the user to speak to-dos to their iPad, iPhone, or Apple Watch and have them automatically appear in Things without having to type. *Siri Shortcuts integration on iOS & iPadOS allows the user to automate common tasks by tapping Siri suggestions, recording a spoken phrase, or by adding shortcuts to Apple's Shortcuts app. *Repeating To-Dos are automatically generated by the app based on flexible recurrence rules, such as the last day of every month, every other Thursday, or two weeks after the last one was completed, etc. – whatever the user chooses. *Tags allow the user to further describe to-dos using the popular tagging organisation paradigm; lists can then be filtered by these tags to search for and focus on specific types of tasks. *Mail to Things is a cloud service that allows the user to send (or forward) emails to a private address and have the email automatically converted into a to-do in their Things inbox. *Widgets allow the user to quickly access specific lists from their device's Home Screen or Notification Center on Mac, iPad, and iPhone. *Things URLs is a URL scheme that allows the user to construct special links for doing such things as creating to-dos or projects based on predefined values, invoking searches, or filtering lists. *Type Travel is a unique method for navigating the app on the user's Mac (or iPad with external keyboard) by simply typing where in the app they want to go: a project, area, to-do, or tag. *Quick Find allows the user to search through all their to-dos across projects, areas, and the Logbook. *Logbook is where projects and to-dos are stored for future reference after they've been completed.  Things Cloud  Things Cloud is a sync service that stores the user's to-dos and automatically keeps them updated across all their Apple devices. It was developed to replace the app's original sync technology, which only worked over a local network. The company began alpha testing the new service in 2011 and, after an extended beta period, launched it publicly on August 9, 2012 with the release of Things 2. A user can create a free Things Cloud account from within the apps' settings. In 2015, the company announced \\"Nimbus\\" – an update to Things Cloud's architecture which introduced push sync through the cloud. The main benefit of the new push technology is that it delivers sync to iOS & iPadOS devices when the app isn't actively running, by utilizing APNs.

This rare and aggressive form of breast cancer is characterized as being composed of a mixed group of neoplasms containing both glandular and non-glandular patterns with epithelial and/or mesenchymal components. It accounts for fewer than 1% of all breast cancer diagnoses. It is most closely associated with invasive ductal carcinoma of no special type. (IDC), and shares similar treatment approaches. Relative to IDC, MCB generally has higher histological grade and larger tumor size at time of diagnosis, with a lower incidence of axillary lymph node involvement. MCB tumors are typically estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor-2 (HER-2) negative, meaning hormone therapy is generally not an effective treatment option, which correlates to a relatively poor prognosis. MCB was first recognized as a distinct pathological entity in 2000 by the World Health Organization. Classification Owing to its relatively recent pathological distinction, multiple classification systems have been adopted for MCB among different organizations and research groups. The World Health Organization classifies MCB under two categories: Epithelial-type and mixed-type. The epithelial-type is further classified as squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma with spindle cell differentiation, and adenosquamous carcinoma. The mixed-type is further classified as carcinoma with chondroid metaplasia, carcinoma with osseous metaplasia, and carcinosarcoma. Wargotz et al. proposed a classification system for MCB according to its cytopathological features. These classifications are spindle cell, squamous cells, matrix-producing, carcinosarcoma, and MCB with osteoclastic giant cell. Another research group, Oberman et al., proposed a classification system consisting of spindle cell carcinoma, invasive ductal carcinoma with extensive squamous metaplasia, and invasive ductal carcinoma with pseudosarcomatous metaplasia. The lack of consensus between these various classification systems for MCB has led to complications in both clinical practice and research studies. Risk Factors In most MCB cases, patients are women over the age of 50, indicating that age is a major factor in determining the risk of developing MCB. Genetics are another primary risk factor for developing MCB. Genetic mutations and family history both correlate to higher risk. Signs & Symptoms The most common presenting symptom of MCB is a rapidly growing, palpable mass of the breast. If the tumor has metastasized, more severe symptoms will be presented, depending on the site of metastasis. Diagnosis Mammography is a standard diagnostic tool for MCB, where the tumors will typically display as a high- density mass. However, they can also mimic IDCs as well as benign lesions in the mammogram. Sonography is also often used to help diagnose MCB, where solid and cystic components may be observed. This is related to necrosis and cystic degeneration. In Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) smears, only 57% of cases show ductal carcinoma and metaplastic components. Consequently, roughly half of MCB tumors cannot be diagnosed by FNA. Pathologic tissue diagnosis is therefore essential to distinguish MCB from other breast cancers in order to institute proper and prompt treatment. This is achieved using immunohistochemistry with a cytokeratin panel to distinguish such cases from phyllodes tumors, primary sarcomas, and fibromatoses. Prognosis The prognosis of MCB can vary between different sub-classifications, which, given the heterogeneity of classification systems, makes assigning prognoses difficult. However, the prognosis for MCB is generally poor. Predictors associated with worse prognosis of MCB include age younger than 39 years at presentation, tumor invasion of the skin, and squamous cell carcinoma spread to the lymph nodes. The 5-year survival rate for MCB varies by classification, and ranges from 49% in the most deadly classifications to 64%. Treatment Despite the range of classifications of MCB, treatment options are standard with other breast cancers. If the tumor is diagnosed early, breast-saving surgery could be an option, although this is relatively uncommon. In non-metastatic MCB, the most common treatment is mastectomy. If the tumor is metastatic, surgery is no longer a viable option, and treatment generally defaults to aggressive chemotherapy. Because MCB tumors are typically triple-negative, hormone therapy is not usually an option for treatment. This is directly related to its relatively poor prognosis.

This term is equivalent to disease management for chronic conditions. The work involves motivating patients to persist in necessary therapies and interventions and helping them to achieve an ongoing, reasonable quality of life.  Chronic care and the medical system  Historically, there has been little coordination across the multiple settings, providers and treatments of chronic illness care. In addition, the treatments for chronic diseases are often complicated, making it difficult for patients to comply with treatment protocols. Effective medical care usually requires longer visits to the doctor's office than is common in acute care. Moreover, in treating chronic illnesses, the same intervention, whether medical or behavioral, may differ in effectiveness depending on when in the course of the illness the intervention is suggested. Fragmentation of care is a risk for patients with chronic diseases, because frequently multiple chronic diseases coexist. Necessary interventions can require input from multiple specialists that may not usually work together, and to be effective, they require close, careful coordination. Research has shown that highly fragmented care for Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions are more likely to present in emergency rooms and be admitted than others. As a consequence, patients with chronic conditions can fare poorly in the current acute-care model of care delivery. Historically, reimbursement has been challenging for care coordination services. Medicare recently started paying for services related to chronic care management. Medicare pays a monthly fee for patients who consent to treatment for a minimum of 20 minutes of telehealth services.  Personal chronic care management  Patients with chronic conditions have an important role in the management of their conditions, as they are often the ones administering the treatments in everyday life. They also play an important role in monitoring their health and changes in their health by means of Observations of Daily Living (ODLs).Health in Everyday Living Robert Wood Johnson Foundation primer Resulting information may inform both self care and clinical care.  Importance  Certain problems related to chronic illness are not specifically medical, but involve patients' interactions with families and workplaces. Interventions often require patients and families to make difficult lifestyle changes. Patients need to be educated on the benefits of treatment and the risks of not properly following their treatment regimen. They need to be motivated to comply because treatment usually produces an improved state, rather than the results that most patients desire—a cure. Chronic care management helps patients systematically monitor their progress and coordinate with experts to identify and solve any problems they encounter in their treatment. It would appear from the above, that chronically ill persons are better cared for by primary care physicians. Considering the diverse nature of chronic health problems and the roles that psychosocial environments play in their course, a purely biological model of care is usually inadequate. The biopsychosocial model of care is the ideal alternative.  History  Although acute care has characterized all medical care until recently, several varieties of managed care have emerged in the past decades in an effort to improve care, reduce unnecessary service utilization and control spiraling costs. Despite its initial promise, however, managed care has not achieved truly coordinated care. In actual operation it appears to emphasize its fiscal goals. Moreover, managed care does not address the complexity of chronic conditions, and in the interests of cost-cutting, tends to reduce time with patients rather than increase it.  Chronic care models  In the latter part of the 20th century, researchers began to develop care models for the assessment and treatment of the chronically ill. Nurse researchers, such as S. Wellard, C. S. Burckhardt, C. Baker and P. N. Stern, and I. M. Lubkin and P. D. Larson,Lubkin, I.M. and Larson, P.D. (2002). Chronic illness: Impact and interventions (5th ed.) Sudbury, MA: Jones and Bartlett. were often on the front lines of actual care for patients with ongoing treatments for conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure. They stated that their patients experienced a series of \\"phases\\", and that during some of these phases the patients responded to the same interventions quite differently. Individuals who suffered from chronic illnesses, such as C. RegisterRegister, C. (1987). The Chronic Illness Experience: Embracing the Imperfect Life. Center City MN: Hazelton. and S. Wells,Wells, S.M. (1988). A Delicate Balance: Living Successfully With Chronic Illness. New York: Plenum Press. have given detailed accounts of their experiences and made recommendations about how to manage chronic conditions. Associations proliferated for those with specific conditions (Sjögren's syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, peripheral neuropathy, etc.), and these groups have engaged in advocacy work, acted as clearinghouses for information, and began funding research. Edward H. Wagner, MD, MPH, Director Emeritus of The MacColl Institute for Healthcare Innovation, and former Director of The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation national program \\"Improving Chronic Illness Care\\", and Emeritus Investigator at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle, WA (formerly Group Health Research Institute) developed the Chronic Care Model, or CCM. The CCM summarizes the basic elements for improving care in health systems on different levels. These elements are the community, the health system, self-management support, delivery system design, decision support and clinical information systems. Evidence-based change concepts under each element, in combination, foster productive interactions between informed patients who take an active part in their care and providers with resources and expertise. The Chronic Care Model can be applied to a variety of chronic illnesses, health care settings and target populations. The bottom line is healthier patients, more satisfied providers, and cost savings. The Stanford Self-Management Program is a community-based self-management program that helps people with chronic illness gain self-confidence in their ability to control their symptoms and manage how their health problems will affect their lives. Partnership for Solutions, a Johns Hopkins/Robert Wood Johnson collaborative, conducts research to improve the care and quality of life for individuals with chronic health conditions. J. O. Prochaska and his colleagues, investigating issues associated with the treatment of addictions, have described a transtheoretical model of behavior change as a process rather than an event. They have advocated assessment and treatment based on the patient’s stage in the process. Patricia Fennell, working on the experiences of imposed change (such as illness, grief, or trauma), has developed the Fennell Four Phase Model of chronic illness. Fennell says people commonly experience four phases as they learn to incorporate their changed physical abilities or psychological outlook into their personality and lifestyle: Crisis, Stabilization, Integration, and Resolution. Established by the investment banking firm Wyatt Matas, the term Care Cycle Management is a chronic care business model that integrates interventional disease management with care delivery to manage the care of high-cost patients. The Flinders Human Behaviour & Health Research Unit (based in Adelaide, South Australia) has developed the Flinders ProgramTM, a generic set of tools and processes that allows for assessment of chronic condition management behaviours, collaborative identification of problems and goal setting leading to the development of individualised care plans with the goal of raising the quality of life for people living with chronic disease. The Flinders ProgramTM has been adapted to specific contexts to meet the needs of Indigenous Australians and veterans.Chronic Care Management Software Chronic care models such as the delivery of chronic disease management programs may be effective for patients with long-term chronic conditions. For patients with asthma, having a coordinated program involving multiple health care professionals can make improvements in aspects such as patients perceived quality of life, lung functioning and the severity of their asthma. A range of studies have shown mindfulness-based pain management (MBPM) to be beneficial for those suffering from chronic pain and other long-term conditions.

Many residents of the mining region felt disconnected from the remote territorial governments of Kansas and Nebraska, so they voted to form their own Territory of Jefferson on October 24, 1859. On November 28, the General Assembly of the Territory of Jefferson organized 12 counties: Arrappahoe County, Cheyenne County, El Paso County, Fountain County, Heele County, Jackson County, Jefferson County, Mountain County, North County, Park County, Saratoga County, and St. Vrain's County. The legislation that created Fountain County declared: > That the territory lying south of the main divide, between the headwaters of > the Arkansas and the south Platte River, and lying east of the summit of the > Rocky Mountains, and not included in El Paso county, be erected into a > county to be called Fountain county. Fountain County encompassed most of what is today the southeastern portion of the State of Colorado. The Jefferson Territory never received federal sanction, but on February 28, 1861, U.S. President James Buchanan signed an act organizing the Territory of Colorado.

Economics of education = Research on the returns to schooling= The bulk of Angrist's research has concentrated on the economics of education, beginning with the returns to schooling. In one early study, Angrist and Krueger exploited the relationship between children's season of birth and educational attainment that is due to policies and laws setting ages for school start and compulsory schooling, finding that returns to education are close to their OLS estimatesAngrist, J.D., Krueger, A.B. (1991). Does compulsory school attendance affect schooling and earnings? Quarterly Journal of Economics, 106(4), pp. 979-1014. and that compulsory attendance laws constrain roughly 10% of students to stay in school who would have otherwise left.Angrist, J.D., Krueger, A.B. (1992). The effect of age at school entry on educational attainment: an application of instrumental variables with moments from two samples. Journal of American Statistical Association, 87(418), pp. 328-336. Another early attempt at using IV to estimate returns to schooling by Angrist and Krueger was to exploit the Vietnam-era draft lottery.Angrist, J.D., Krueger, A.B. (1992). Estimating the payoff to schooling using the Vietnam-era draft lottery. NBER Working Paper Series, No. 4067. However, while their later research on split-sample IVs confirmed the findings of their compulsory schooling research, it failed to support the returns to schooling estimates derived from the draft-lottery research.Angrist, J.D., Krueger, A.B. (1995). Split-sample instrumental variables estimates of the return to schooling. Journal of Business & Economics Statistics, 13(2), pp. 225-235. Angrist further used variation in U.S. compulsory schooling laws in research with Daron Acemoglu in order to estimate human-capital externalities, which they found to be about 1% and not statistically significant.Acemoglu, D., Angrist, J. (2000). How large are human-capital externalities? Evidence from compulsory schooling laws. NBER Macroeconomics Annual, 15, pp. 9-59. Angrist has also studied the strong decrease in the economic returns to schooling in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the 1980s.Angrist, J.D. (1995). The economic returns to schooling in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. American Economic Review, 85(5), pp. 1065-1087. Together with Lavy, Angrist has also explored the returns to schooling in Morocco, exploiting a change in its language of instruction from French to Arabic to find that policy substantially reduced Moroccan youths' returns to schooling by deteriorating their French writing skills.Angrist, J.D., Lavy, V. (1997). The Effect of a Change in Language of Instruction on the Returns to Schooling in Morocco. Journal of Labor Economics, 15(1), pp. S48-S76. = Research on the determinants of student learning= Another strand of Angrist's research in the economics of education concerns the impact of various inputs and rules on learning. For instance, in further work with Lavy, Angrist exploited Maimonides' Rule, which limits class size to 40 students, in order to study the impact of class size on scholastic achievement in Israeli schools, finding that class size reduction substantially increase test scores for 4th and 5th graders, albeit not for 3rd graders.Angrist, J.D., Lavy, V. (1999). Using Maimonides' rule to estimate the effect of class size on scholastic achievement. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 114(2), pp. 533-575. In further research at Israeli schools, they find that teacher training can cost-effectively improve students' test scores (at least in secular schools),Angrist, J.D., Lavy, V. (2001). Does teacher training affect pupil learning? Evidence from matched comparisons in Jerusalem public schools.

In research on school vouchers for private schools in Colombia with Eric Bettinger, Erik Bloom, Elizabeth King and Michael Kremer, Angrist found voucher recipients 10 pp more likely to finish lower secondary school, 5-7 pp more likely to complete high school, and to score 0.2 standard deviations higher on tests, suggesting that the vouchers' benefits likely exceeded their $24 cost.Angrist, J. et al. (2002). Vouchers for private schooling in Colombia: Evidence from a randomized natural experiment. American Economic Review, 92(5), pp. 1535-1558.Angrist, J. Bettinger, E., Kremer, M. (2006). Long-term educational consequences of secondary school vouchers: Evidence from administrative records in Colombia. American Economic Review, 96(3), pp. 847-862. Another subject of Angrist's research are peer effects in education,Angrist, J.D. (2014). The perils of peer effects. Labour Economics, 30, pp. 98-108. which he has e.g. explored with Kevin Lang in the context of METCO's school integrations or with Atila Abdulkadiroglu and Parag Pathak in Boston's and New York City's over- subscribed exam schools, though the effects that they find are brief and modest in both cases.Angrist, J.D., Lang, K. (2004). Does school integration generate peer effects? Evidence from Boston's Metco Program. American Economic Review, 94(5), pp. 1613-1634.Abdulkadiroglu, A., Angrist, J., Pathak, P. (2014). The elite illusion: Achievement effects at Boston and New York exam schools. Econometrica, 82(1), pp. 137-196. With regard to the effect of teacher testing, which Angrist has studied with Jonathan Guryan in the U.S., he finds that state-mandated teacher testing raises teachers' wages without raising their quality, though it decreases teacher diversity by reducing the fraction of new teachers who are Hispanic.Angrist, J.D., Guryan, J. (2008). Does teacher testing raise teacher quality? Evidence from state certification requirements. Economics of Education Review, 27(5), pp. 483-503. In work with Lavy and Analia Schlosser, Angrist has also explored Becker's hypothesis on a trade-off between child quality and quantity by exploiting variation in twin births and parental preferences for compositions of siblings of mixed sexes, with evidence rejecting the hypothesis.Angrist, J., Lavy, V., Schlosser, A. (2010). Multiple experiments for the causal link between the quantity and quality of children. Journal of Labor Economics, 28(4), pp. 773-824.  Research on charter schools Since the late 2000s, Angrist has conducted extensive research on charter schools in the U.S. with Pathak, Abdulkadiroglu, Susan Dynarski, Thomas Kane, and Christopher Walters. For instance, studying the KIPP Lynn Academy, they estimate that KIPP Lynn attendance increased students' math scores by 0.35 SD and their English scores by 0.12 SD,Angrist, J.D. et al. (2010). Inputs and impacts in charter schools: KIPP Lynn. American Economic Review, 100(2), pp. 239-243. with most of the gains accruing to students with limited English proficiency or special education needs or those who scored low at baseline.Angrist, J.D. et al. (2012). Who benefits from KIPP? Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, 31(4), pp. 837-860. Beyond KIPP Lynn, they find attendance to Boston charter schools to generally increase test scores for middle and high school students, especially for schools with binding assignment lotteries, whereas pilot schools (public schools covered by some collective bargaining provisions and more independence concerning educational policies) generally have at best statistically insignificant or small effects on students' test scores.Abdulkadiroglu, A. et al. (2011). Accountability and flexibility in public schools: Evidence from Boston's charters and pilots. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 126(2), pp. 699-748. Further research has attributed the relative efficacy of urban charter schools to these schools' embrace of the No Excuses approach to urban education which emphasizes student discipline and behaviour, traditional reading and math skills, instruction time, and selective teacher hiring.Angrist, J.D., Pathak, P.A., Walters, C.R. (2013). Explaining charter school effectiveness. American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 5(4), pp. 1-27.  Labour economics Similar to his research on the economics of education, Angrist's research on labour economics also often seeks to exploit quasi-natural experiments to identify causal relationships. In a publication derived from his dissertation, Angrist e.g. exploits the military draft lottery during the Vietnam War to estimate that fighting in Vietnam reduced veterans' lifetime earnings by about 15% relative to those of nonveterans.Angrist, J.D. (1990). Lifetime earnings and the Vietnam era draft lottery: evidence from social security administrative records. American Economic Review, 80(3), pp. 313-336. Taking into account veterans' benefits that subsidized education and training (e.g. through the G.I. Bill), he finds that these benefits raised schooling in the U.S. by ca. 1.4 years and veterans' earnings by 6%.Angrist, J.D. (1993). The effect of veterans benefits on education and earnings. ILR Review, 46(4), pp. 637-652. In further work exploiting the idiosyncrasies of U.S. military recruitment, Angrist studies the labour market impact of voluntary military service in the 1980s, estimating that voluntary soldiers serving in the 1980s earned considerably more than comparable civilians while serving and experienced comparatively higher employment rates thereafter, even though it raised their long-run civilian earnings at best modestly and - for whites - reduced them.Angrist, J. (1998). Estimating the labor market impact of voluntary military service using social security data on military applicants. Econometrica, 66(2), pp. 249-288. Together with Krueger, Angrist also investigated with Krueger whether U.S. World War II veterans earned more than nonveterans, finding instead that they earned at most as much as comparable nonveterans.Angrist, J., Krueger, A.B. (1994). Why do World War II veterans earn more than nonveterans? Journal of Labor Economics, 12(1), pp. 74-97. Angrist and Krueger later on summarized their work on causality in labour economics in a chapter of the Handbook of Labor Economics, with special emphasis on controls for confounding variables, fixed effects models and difference-in-differences, instrumental variables estimation and regression discontinuity designs.Angrist, J.D., Krueger, A.B. (1999). Empirical strategies in labor economics. In: Ashenfelter, O.C., Card, D. (eds.) Handbook of Labor Economics, vol. 3A. Amsterdam: Elsevier, pp. 1277-1366. In another study related to the U.S. military, Angrist and John H. Johnson IV use the Gulf War to estimate the effects of work-related separations on military families, showing large differences between the impact of male and female soldiers' deployment on divorce rates and spousal labour supply.Angrist, J.D., Johnson J.H. IV (2000). Effects of work-related absences on families: Evidence from the Gulf War. ILR Review, 54(1), pp. 41-58. In work with William Evans, Angrist exploited families' preference for having siblings of mixed sex to estimate children's impact on parental labour supply, observing that family size had no impact on husbands' labour supply and that the impact on women was being overestimated through OLS.Angrist, J.D., Evans, W.N. (1996). Children and their parents' labor supply: Evidence from exogenous variation in family size. American Economic Review, 88(3), pp. 450-477. In further work with Evans, he also explored the impact of the 1970 state abortion reforms on schooling and labour market outcomes, arguing that they reduced Afro-American teen fertility and thereby raised black women's rates of high school completion, college attendance and employment.Angrist, J.D., Evans, W.N. (2000). Schooling and labor market consequences of the 1970 state abortion reforms. Research in Labor Economics, pp. 75-113. In another study with Acemoglu, Angrist has also analysed the consequences of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), finding a sharp drop in employment of persons with disabilities (PwDs) shortly after its inception, thus suggesting that ADA has likely hurt PwDs' labour market outcomes.Acemoglu, D., Angrist, J.D. (2001). Consequences of employment protection? The case of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Journal of Political Economy, 109(5), pp. 915-957. Angrist has also studied the U.S. marriage market, finding - by exploiting endogamy in marriages - that high male-female sex ratios increased the likelihood of female marriage and decreased their labour force participation.Angrist, J. (2002). How do sex ratios affect marriage and labor markets? Evidence from America's second generation. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 117(3), pp. 997-1038. Together with Adriana Kugler, Angrist finds that labour market institutions that reduce labour market flexibility exacerbate native job losses from immigration, especially regarding restricted product markets.Angrist, J.D., Kugler, A.D. (2003). Protective or counter- productive? Labour market institutions and the effect of immigration on EU natives. Economic Journal, 113(488), pp. F302-F331. Angrist and Kugler also investigated the relationship between coca prices and civil conflict in Colombia, observing that financial opportunities offered by coca cultivation fueled the conflict, with cultivated rural areas witnessing pronounced increases in violence.Angrist, J.D., Kugler, A.D. (2008). Rural windfall or a new resource curse? Coca, income, and civil conflict in Colombia. Review of Economics and Statistics, 90(2), pp. 191-215.  Econometrics Besides his empirical research, Angrist has also made major contributions to econometrics, especially concerning the use of instrumental variables estimations. For instance, Angrist developed a two-stage least squares (2SLS) equivalent of the efficient Wald estimator.Angrist, J.D. (1991). Grouped-data estimation and testing in simple labor-supply models. Journal of Econometrics, 47(2-3), pp. 243-266. Together with Guido Imbens, he developed the concept of local average treatment effects and showed how to identify and to estimate them,Angrist, J., Imbens, G. (1994). Identification and estimation of local average treatment effects. Econometrica, 62(2), pp. 467-475. and how to use 2SLS to estimate the average causal effect of variable treatments.Angrist, J.D., Imbens, G.W. (1995). Two-stage least squares estimation of average causal effects in models with variable treatment intensity. Journal of the American Statistical Association, 90(430), pp. 431-442. In further work with Imbens and Donald Rubin, Angrist then showed how instrumental variables can be embedded within the Rubin causal model in order to identify causal effects between variables.Angrist, J.D., Imbens, G.W., Rubin, D.B. (1996). Identification of causal effects using instrumental variables. Journal of the American Statistical Association, 91(434), pp. 444-455. Angrist also developed with Imbens and Krueger so-called \\"jackknife instrumental variables estimators\\" to address the bias in 2SLS estimates in over-identified modelsAngrist, J.D., Imbens, G.W., Krueger, A.B. (1999). Jackknife instrumental variables estimation. Journal of Applied Econometrics, 14(1), pp. 57-67. and has explored the interpretation of IV estimators in simultaneous equations models along with Imbens and Kathryn Graddy.Angrist, J.D., Graddy, K., Imbens, G.W. (2000). The interpretation of instrumental variables estimators in simultaneous equations models with an application to the demand for fish. Review of Economic Studies, 67(3), pp. 499-527. Again with Imbens, along with Alberto Abadie, he has also studied the effect of subsidized training due to the Job Training Partnership Act of 1982 on the quantiles of trainee earnings, finding large effects of JTPA on low-wage female workers but significant effects on men only for the upper half of the male trainee earnings distribution.Abadie, A., Angrist, J., Imbens, G. (2002). Instrumental variables estimates of the effects of subsidized training on the quantiles of trainee earnings. Econometrica, 70(1), pp. 91-117. With regard to limited dependent variable models with binary endogenous regressors, Angrist argues in favour of using 2SLS, multiplicative models for conditional means, linear approximation of non-linear causal models, models for distribution effects, and quantile regression with an endogenous binary regressor.Angrist, J.D. (2001). Estimation of limited dependent variable models with dummy endogenous regressors: simple strategies for empirical practice. Journal of Business & Economics Statistic, 19(1), pp. 2-28. Angrist has also explored the link between local average treatment effects and population average treatment effects, i.e., the external validity of IV estimates.Angrist, J.D. (2004). Treatment effect heterogeneity in theory and practice. Economic Journal, 114(494), pp. C52-C83. Finally, along with Victor Chernozhukov and Iván Fernández-Val, Angrist has also explored quantile regressions, showing that they minimize a weighted MSE loss function for specification error.Angrist, J., Chernozhukov, V., Fernández-Val, I. (2006). Quantile regression under misspecification, with an application to the US wage structure. Econometrica, 74(2), pp. 539-563. In articles with Krueger as well as with Jorn-Steffen Pischke in the Journal of Economic Perspectives, Angrist has repeatedly made the case for a focus on the identification of causality in economics, e.g. using instrumental variables;Angrist, J.D., Krueger, A.B. (2001). Instrumental variables and the search for identification: From supply and demand to natural experiments. Journal of Economic Perspectives, 15(4), pp. 69-85. in particular, Angrist has argued in 2010 in response to Edward Leamer's 1983 critique of econometrics that microeconomics had experienced since then a \\"credibility revolution\\" thanks to substantial improvements in empirical research designs and renewed attention to causal relationships.Angrist, J.D., Pischke, J.-S. (2010). The credibility revolution in empirical economics: How better research design is taking the con out of econometrics. Journal of Economic Perspectives, 24(2), pp. 3-30.  Honours and awards Angrist is a Research Fellow at the Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA). He is also a fellow of the Econometric Society. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2006. In 2007 Angrist received an honorary doctorate in Economics from the University of St. Gallen.http://www.unisg.ch/en/Schools/Economics+and+Political+Science/Ueber+SEPS/Dozierende/Ehrendoktorate.aspx He is the recipient of the 2011 John von Neumann Award given annually by the Rajk László College for Advanced Studies in Budapest.

He was born in Kristinehamn but grew up in Borås. He took an engineering degree at Linköping University in 2001, after which he moved to Chamonix in France to focus on skiing. He specialized in skiing down some of the world's highest and steepest mountains. He had gone from the top of Aconcagua in Argentina (6960 m), Lenin Peak in Kyrgyzstan (7134 m), Muztagh Ata (7546 m) and Kuksay Peak (7134 m) in China and Cho Oyu in Tibet (8201 m). Biography Tomas Olsson lived in Chamonix in France where he worked as a professional extreme skier. Birth and early life He was born in Kristinehamn and raised in Borås. From the beginning he was just an ordinary lad but during high school became aware of action sports. Over the years, interest grew and MSc studies in Linköping was devoted every spare moment to skiing and climbing. After completing graduation in 2001, he moved to Chamonix in France to pursue the life of an adventurous skier. Life in Chamonix Steep skiing and climbing was his everyday life. The base is Chamonix in the French Alps and a couple of times a year he went to exotic locations to explore new environments and his own limits. With skis on his feet, Tomas had skied from the summit of Aconcagua (6960m) in Argentina, Peak Lenin (7134m) in Kirigizistan, Muztagh Ata (7546m) & Kuksay Peak (7134m) in China, Cho Oyu (8201m) in Tibet and a Volcano in Kamchatka in the far away Siberia. Besides skiing he had held lectures and worked with product development and promotional issues with Bergans of Norway & Silva Sweden. Desire to ski down Everest Tomas's ultimate goal, which was scheduled for spring 2006, was to once again stand on the summit of Everest and from the top of the world's highest mountain directing the skis toward Tibet and become the first skier in the world to ski down Everest's steep north side of the mountain. At the end of March 2006, he set off to go to Everest. The goal together with Norwegian Tormod Granheim was to be the first in the world to ski from the top and down the mountain's north side. During October and November, he was in Sweden to tie a couple of new partners to the office and work out optimum communication- & logistics solutions. Then it was off to Chamonix in France, to fine-tune the shape during the winter. As training for the Everest Expedition in the summer of 2005, he cycled alone from Stockholm to Chamonix in France, climbed the Mont Blanc (4810m) and then rode back to Sweden. He was an adventurer full-time and his goal was to in May 2006, becoming the first in the world to ski down the north side of Everest, the world's highest mountain. Adventures In June 2005, he went off on what he called a training expedition, where he was on a bicycle came from Stockholm down to Chamonix in France to climb Mont Blanc. Olsson cycled the 2500 km long tour down to Chamonix of 17 days and 4 July he climbed Mont Blanc. Then he took his bicycle and cycled the 2500 km back to Sweden and Stockholm again. He started the ride on Monday 13 June 2005, could see the expedition which ended on Friday, 22 July 2005. In the media, he has mentioned that this bike ride, he made partly in honor of the now deceased adventurer Göran Kropp who in October 1995 embarked on his legendary adventure on the bike to Mount Everest for a clean solo ascent. Tomas Olsson was a Swedish adventurer and ski mountaineer who attempted to be the first to make a complete ski descent from the summit of Mount Everest down the Norton Couloir (via North Col), with partner Tormod Granheim, in Spring 2006. In early April 2006 gave Olsson set off on an expedition to Mount Everest together with the Norwegian extreme skier Tormod Graneheim. The goal of the expedition was to try to become the first in the world to ski down the steep north side of the mountain. Tomas Olsson, his Norwegian partner Tormod Granheim and photographer Fredrik Schenholm approached Everest from the Tibetan side in Spring 2006. Olsson climbed the mountain from Advanced Base Camp, 6400 meters above sea level, to the summit (8848 m) in a 2 days effort. The route he follows known as the Mallory route normally takes climbers five days to complete. Olsson and Graneheim reached Everest's peak on 16 May 2006. The pair then skied into the North Face by the Norton Couloir, a 55 degree steep and nearly 3000 meter high mountain face. North Col (North Face) Route is one of the most difficult of all the difficult routes to the top of the mountain. On May 16, 2006, after a full day of climbing, the two met up on the mountain and reached the summit. Exhausted, they wondered if they had the strength to ski down. Undeterred by their fatigue, they set off on skis down the North Face via the Norton Couloir at angles as steep as 60 degrees and a sheer 3,000 meter drop. Unfortunately, just as they set off, and after only skiing down the North Face approximately 1,500 feet, one of Olsson’s skis broke, adding extra tension to the already complex task. They tried to repair the ski with tape. A cliff intersecting the couloir forced the two to make an abseil. A snow anchor failed and Olsson fell an estimated 2500 meters to his death. Granheim skied alone to the North Col. Tomas Olsson was not the only one to attempt skiing down Mount Everest this year he was part of \\"The Vikings are back: Climb + Sky-ski Everest expedition 2006\\" with the ambition to ski down the North Col route of Mount Everest. As part of an ongoing project to ski the Seven summits, the Swedish expedition were involved in a project of climbing and sky-skiing down the Seven Summits. The expedition consisted of Tomas Olsson, Tormod Granheim from Norway and Fredrik Schenholm. The guys successfully skied down Cho Oyu in fall, 2004. However, logistical problems prevented the pair from attempting a similar feat on Shisha Pangma. Olsson and Granheim had been training hard all winter in Chamonix, French Alps, for the upcoming Everest challenge. Fredrik Schenholm would join the expedition as a photographer. Another expedition, Swedish Everest Ski expedition (Martin Letzter and Olof Sundstrom), also skied down Everest the same day as Tomas Olsson using an easier route. They had already skied Elbrus, Denali, Aconcagua, Kosciuszko, and Kilimanjaro during the last three years. To reach Mount Everest the team reached Tibet after driving 12 000 kilometers from Stockholm to Kathmandu, through such countries as Russia, Poland, Romania, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan and India, in a 13-year-old Land Rover Defender. The team would have skied the Antarctica the coming winter if they would have been successful in completing their series by skiing Mt. Vinson during the Antarctic summer 2006/2007. During the expedition in May 2006, Olsson, while rappelling down a 150-meter rock cliff at 8,500 meters up, fell to his death when his snow anchor broke, which knocked him unconscious and sent him sliding down the wall to his death, dying the day after David Sharp froze to death in Green Boots Cave.

Pashto music is commonly performed in Afghanistan and Pakistan among Pashtun people. The major center for Pashto music and arts is found in Peshawar, Pakistan. Genres Tappa Tappa is the oldest and most popular genre of the Pashto poetry. The Tappa is a composition of two unequal meters, in which the first line is shorter than the succeeding one, yet it reflects all human feelings and aspirations elegantly. Be it laborers, peasants, or women, all sentiments find expression in the Tappa. It is also common among the Pashtuns that a boy of school age would sing it, the elders in their hujrahs, or the women in their home and Godar alike. It is the only song sung in the time of grief and on the occasion of marriage. In music it is sung with the traditional Afghan musical instruments rubab and mangai. Tappa has up to 16 different models of harmony and is sung with full orchestra. In hujrah it is sung with rubab and sitar. Charbeta Charbetta is another popular genre, which consists of an epic poem with special rhythms. There are four kinds of Charbettas. Normally, it is a poem of four lines but might also have six or eight lines. All aspects of life are discussed in it. That includes the heroic deeds and heroism of legendary figures and sometimes expresses romantic feelings. The tempo is usually very fast and is sung by two or more singers as part of a chorus in which one singer reads the first line while the others follow the remaining. The singing or recitation of a Charbetta is called Tang Takore. Traditionally Charbetta is started just after the finishing of a Tappa. Neemakai Neemakai has many different forms and normally women compose it. It is usually very short (1 to 3 lines). The first lines are repeated in the middle of the song and Tappa is usually added according to the subject and circumstances. Most of these songs in Pashtun culture have been expressed in different areas about daily life and love. Loba The rubab is often used in Pashto music Loba is very popular among the masses and are added within Tappas occasionally. This is a form of folk music in which a story is told. It requires 2 or more persons who reply to each other in a poetic form. The two sides are usually the lover and the beloved (the man and woman). Shaan Shaan is sung during happy occasions such as marriages or the birth of a child, and is sung in private congregations and social gatherings. Badala Badala is a professional form of folk music and consists of an epic poem or a ballad. Instruments used include the rubab, harmonium, mungey or tabla. In Badala, tribal traditions are the main theme as well as heroism, tragedies and romance. Badala consists of variations, because each couplet is varied in rhythms from the others. It is sung traditionally at night. Rubayi Rubayi is a Pashto form of a Ghazal. The Rubayis of Rehman Baba are popular among the masses and is sung before the starting of Badala. As with the Ghazals, the Rubayi have been heavily influenced by Arabic, Persian and Turkic poetry. Takki Whilst not strictly speaking a literary form, Takki are a common form of entertainment in large gatherings. Two contestants take turns to extemporaneously deliver verses attacking the other, not unlike a rap battle. This is sometimes also called Hujooh or Lughat, and is more common in the southern districts of KPK and the areas across the border, such as Khost https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvHe5ckBgCo.

It is part of the British New Church Movement (BNCM) and has links with other BNCM leaders and movements, especially Gerald Coates of Pioneer Network.Brian Hewitt, Doing a New Thing? (London: Hodder, 1995, ) 112 History Ichthus Christian Fellowship was founded in London in 1974 by Roger T. Forster.Brian Hewitt, Doing a New Thing? (London: Hodder, 1995) 106 By 1982 the Forest Hill congregation had grown to around 400 people, and two new congregations were planted. In 1990 Ichthus had 43 congregations; in 1992, Ichthus had 47 congregations, and was split into three areas. After some rationalisation the number of congregations dropped to 27. In 2002 a further major change involved a number of churches disaffiliating and forming a separate group known as Transform Network; still others became independent. Ichthus congregations meet across London as well as in Essex and Kent. Approximately 130 other churches and movements across the UK and Europe are linked with Ichthus Christian Fellowship. In comparison to other BNCM streams, the Ichthus link relationship is reasonably loose, denoting shared theology, vision and values, rather than an attempt to create a larger identity (such as Newfrontiers and the Pioneer Network). Vision Ichthus is characterised by \\"social and racial inclusiveness,\\" s.v. \\"Roger Forster\\" according to Peter Hocken. Ichthus theology is also non-Calvinist, and shares much with Open Theism; believes in the practice of spiritual warfare and takes an egalitarian position on the issue of women's leadership, (both formal and informal), with congregations led by women.Brian Hewitt, Doing a New Thing? (London: Hodder, 1995) 119 Ichthus identifies Anabaptism as the Christian tradition that has been most influential in its development.Ronald Sider, Bread of Life: Stories of Radical Mission (London: Triangle, 1994, ) 26 Ichthus has committed itself to social action,Ronald Sider Bread of Life: Stories of Radical Mission (London: Triangle, 1996) 19 which has included starting a primary school, a launderette, action for the unemployed, pregnancy advice and other similar projects.

Hewitt says: \\"Any emphasis on 'new' churches to the virtual exclusion of the 'old' seemed to him both ignorant and arrogant.\\" Instead of being distant from other churches, therefore, Ichthus has tended towards ecumenism and cooperation.

The role of a church usher is typically a volunteer position, and in the past was often considered one of honor, particularly if a church committee selects an usher by a nomination.  History  The concept of an usher is not new. In the Old Testament, there were positions addressed as \\"Doorkeepers\\" or \\"Gatekeepers\\", and their roles were very similar.(2 Kings 22:4) (1 Chronicles 9:17-27) (Psalms 84:10) Jesus' disciples could be considered ushers, in the sense that they: *Prepared the way for Jesus *Kept order among those listening to Christ *Served food to the audience *Cleaned up after a service, such as the Feeding of the Five Thousand.  Organization  Churches often have a group of people that work as ushers led by a head usher. The ushers typically receive their instructions from the head usher. The head usher receives instructions directly from the pastor and is responsible for training and scheduling ushers.  Dress  Traditionally ushers wore three piece suits. In most contemporary churches, a more casual dress style has become acceptable.  Duties  The church usher has various duties. Depending on the church's denomination, size, and preferences, ushers may perform some or all of the following: * Seat guest * Collect the tithes and offering * Distribute communion * Keep order at the entrance of the sanctuary * Distribute bulletins and service programs * Handle disturbances References  External links  * How to Usher in a Church - wikiHow * Plusline:Usher Ministry Description Christian worship roles Christian religious occupations Ushers ","title":"Church usher"},{"id":"14441348","text":"Alice Frame is a fictional character from the daytime soap opera, Another World, most notably portrayed by Jacqueline Courtney. Character history Alice Matthews was born and raised in Bay City, Illinois and was a member of the prominent Matthews family, though she grew up middle-class. She was an average college girl with no problems, until she met Steve Frame. They fell head over heels in love and soon decided to get married. Alice with Eliot Carrington. She worked as his son's governess. There was just one thing in the way of Steve and Alice's happiness and her name was Rachel Matthews. Rachel was married to Alice's brother, Russ. Alice already disliked Rachel since she believed she was a goldigger who had only married Russ to become part of Bay City high society (and she would be correct). Rachel also fell for Steve and one night, after Steve and Alice had a fight, the pair made love. Rachel arrived at Steve and Alice's engagement party and announced she was pregnant with Steve's baby. When Steve rejected Rachel to stay with Alice, she passed the baby off as Russ's and he was named James Gerald \\"Jamie\\" Matthews. When the truth about Jamie's paternity came out, Alice left town. In 1971, Alice returned to Bay City and finally married Steve. Shortly after Alice was pregnant. Rachel schemed to get Steve away from Alice by making the condition that Steve could only see Jamie in her presence. One day, Steve went to visit Jamie and Alice fell off a ladder and lost their child. Alice was convinced Steve was having an affair with Rachel and she fled to New York City. In the city, she called herself Alice Talbot and was the governess of Dennis Carrington, son of the dashing Eliot Carrington. Alice grew to care deeply for Dennis and Eliot, and Eliot even proposed marriage to Alice. Iris Carrington, Eliot's ex-wife and Dennis's mother, meddled in Alice and Eliot's relationship since she was hoping to reconcile with Eliot. Steve begged Alice for a second chance. Alice agreed to try again and the pair remarried. Steve went to prison for embezzlement and Alice had a mental breakdown. Her Aunt Liz moved in to take care of her. Tim McGowan convinced Alice to sign over Steve's power of attorney to him as well as a stock transfer. He did this to embezzle money from Steve. Alice was finally put into a sanitarium to be given proper help. Tim was eventually caught and his power of attorney was revoked. Alice recovered and went home. She then learned she could never conceive another child, which Rachel found out. When Rachel told Steve, Alice thought they were over, but Steve did not care about her infertility. They reconciled and went off to St. Croix. Alice returned to nursing. One day at the hospital, she met a 10-year-old girl named Sally Spencer and wanted to adopt her. When Steve was in Australia, his helicopter crashed and he was presumed dead, leaving Alice devastated. She still decided to go ahead with Sally's adoption. Alice dated Willis Frame, Steve's brother, and they became engaged, but never made it down the aisle. Alice with her sister Pat, 1973. Alice was finally head of Frame Enterprises and Willis was not happy. Sally's biological grandmother, Beatrice, was still mad she did not win custody of Sally and she kidnapped her. Luckily, Sally was rescued safe and sound. Alice eventually married Ray Gordon, Sally's biological uncle, only because she had given up hope that Steve was alive. Ray changed Frame Enterprises to Gordon Enterprises. She realized the marriage was a mistake and they divorced. Alice helped Sharlene Frame when Russ Matthews threw her out after discovering her past as a prostitute. When Dan Shearer came to town, they became close friends. Even though Dan was divorced from Alice's cousin, Susan, he and Alice became intimate. When Olive Randolph, Dan's ex, heard about their engagement, she tried to kill Alice in a fire. Alice's brother-in-law, John Randolph, saved her, but was killed in the process. Alice broke off her engagement to Dan. She left Sally with Liz to take a nursing position in Chicago. In 1981, Alice returned to Bay City and became a private nurse. Alice began dating Mac Cory, Rachel's ex-husband, and the two became engaged. Alice broke off her engagement to Mac when Steve turned up alive. The star-crossed lovers were reunited, but on the eve of their wedding, Steve and Rachel got trapped under some beams and he admitted his love for her. Alice and Steve did not go through with the marriage and Steve reunited with Rachel. Alice departed Bay City once more. Steve was later killed (for real this time) in a car crash. During her time away, Alice earned her medical degree and became a grandmother when it was discovered Sally had a son named Kevin, who she had given up and was reunited with. Alice returned to town for Sally's wedding to Kevin's father, David Thatcher. She missed the ceremony, which Sally had run out on. When David was killed, Alice thought Dr. Royal Dunning was responsible, but he was not. She helped Rachel recover from a bout of amnesia after she was kidnapped by dastardly Carl Hutchins. Rachel was horrified to learn how she treated Alice over the years, but Alice let her know it was all in the past. She had a relationship with Mark Singleton, but it did not work out. She accepted a position in Washington, D.C. and bid farewell to Bay City once more. Sally was killed in a car accident, but Alice did not return for her funeral. She did return for the 25th anniversary of Brava magazine (the show's 25th anniversary). She and Rachel briefly reminisced about their history: Rachel said how happy Alice had made Steve and Alice said that it was Rachel who gave him a son. It appeared the two women were truly at peace with each other. Alice returned once more for Mac's funeral. This would be her last appearance in Bay City.

Early life Aldred was born in East Melbourne, Victoria, on 1 August 1945. He was educated at Melbourne High School and Monash University, and held the degrees of Bachelor of Economics and Master of Administration from Monash University. During 1970–71 he was Special Projects Officer in the Commonwealth Public Service Board in Melbourne. This was followed by two years in the period 1971–73, as Management Training Officer at the Administrative College of Papua New Guinea. Though principally based in Port Moresby, Aldred also had responsibility for running management courses in several of PNG's major regional centres. In June 1973 Aldred returned to the Commonwealth Public Service Board in Melbourne as Industrial Information Officer. Later that year he was appointed Senior Industry Survey Officer in the Commonwealth Industries Assistance Commission, also in Melbourne. He remained there until elected to Federal Parliament in December 1975 as the Member for Henty. Military service From 1965 to 1971, Aldred served in the Australian Army Reserve. His first four years were in the Melbourne University Regiment (MUR) and the last two years as a lieutenant and platoon commander in the newly formed Monash University Regiment (Mon UR). He was also Assistant Adjutant of Mon UR, and founded and edited the joint regimental publication, The Military Review. Aldred had a three-month attachment to the Australian Regular Army over the summer of 1968–69, as a sergeant instructor in 1 Recruit Training Battalion (1RTB) at Kapooka in New South Wales. Political career Federal election Upon election as federal member for Henty in the Australian House of Representatives in the Liberal landslide of 13 December 1975, Aldred assumed a very active role in Coalition and Parliamentary Committees. He chaired the Government Members' Small Business Committee, working closely with the Industry Minister, Phillip Lynch, on small business policy formulation. As Chairman of the Government Members' Worker Participation Committee, Aldred produced the first definitive set of proposals for a Coalition worker participation policy, to then prime minister, Malcolm Fraser. Many of the proposals were incorporated in a worker participation policy later announced by the productivity minister, Ian McPhee. Expenditure Committee Aldred was an active member of the newly established Expenditure Committee of the House of Representatives and as Chairman of the Government Members' Trade Sub- Committee, worked closely with the Deputy Prime Minister and Trade Minister, Doug Anthony. Manpower Development Executive Defeated in October 1980, by the later House Speaker, Joan Child, Ken Aldred returned to the training profession. In early 1981 he took up the position of Manpower Development Executive with the Victorian Dairy Processing Industry Training Committee (VDPITC), operating under the auspices of the Australian Dairy Cooperation (ADC). In this capacity he spent over two years setting up training courses and training manuals for Victoria's dairy industry factories. He spent a considerable amount of time visiting factories in the state's three dairying regions, namely Gippsland, the Western District and the Northern Region. Ken Aldred left VDPITC on re-election to the federal parliament in May 1983. He re-entered the House of Representatives through the by-election in Bruce, which followed the resignation of House Speaker, Sir Billy Snedden, after the Coalition defeat in the 1983 federal election. House of Representatives During his time as the MHR for Bruce, Aldred took a prominent role on defence and economic issues, as chair of the Opposition Defence Committee and the Opposition Treasury Committee. In 1985, he was elected by the Liberal Party to represent Australia at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, as the Opposition Parliamentary Adviser to the Australian Mission. At the UN, he became involved in committee work on the international drug trade and on Antarctica. Shortly afterwards in 1986–87 he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the then Leader of the Opposition, John Howard. Following an electoral re-distribution he was elected to represent Deakin in the 1990 federal election and remained there until the 1996 election, when he lost pre- selection to his successor, Phil Barresi. Throughout his six years as member for Deakin, Aldred was a most active Liberal member on the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts, spearheading the inquiries into business migration and the Australian Taxation Office. The Charter of Taxpayers' Rights and other reforms to Tax Office administration were largely attributed to him. As a result of these inquiries, abuses of the Business Migration Programme were eliminated and significant reforms were made to Tax Office administration, including the introduction of the Charter of Taxpayer's Rights. At this time he was also Chairman of the Opposition Immigration and Ethnic Affairs Committee. During the 1980s, Aldred successfully advocated for the immigration to Australia of a large group of Jewish refusniks from the Soviet Union, when they had been refused admission by the federal Labor government. Controversy In November 1989, Aldred and Senator Jim Short alleged that Labor MP Lewis Kent was \\"an agent of a foreign power\\" and had ties to the UDBA, the Yugoslav secret police. Their allegations were based on a statutory declaration from a member of Melbourne's Yugoslav community. Kent vigorously denied their claims, describing them as a smear campaign. The House of Representatives later voted on party lines to suspend Aldred for two days, following a report from the privileges committee. Aldred was disendorsed by the Liberal Party for Deakin in 1995 for the 1996 federal election and subsequently used parliamentary privilege to make allegations of involvement in espionage and drug trafficking against a prominent Jewish lawyer and a senior foreign affairs official, using documents that were later found to be forged, which had been supplied to him by LaRouche movement front organisation the Citizens Electoral Council. He also alleged that the Department of Foreign Affairs had twenty child sexual abusers employed in senior positions, and named senior diplomat John Holloway, who was charged and later acquitted. Publications Aldred was a regular writer on policy issues for magazines and newspapers. Additionally he was co-editor and contributor to three books. The first, The Heart of Liberalism, was produced in 1994 with fellow Liberal MPs Kevin Andrews and Paul Filing. It presented a pragmatic and centrist philosophy and set of policies for the Liberal Party. After politics After leaving federal parliament in 1996, Aldred was President and later Chairman of the Society of Australian Industry and Employment (SAIE) 2001–08, during which he devoted much time and energy to promoting the interests of Australian industry. This included editing and contributing to two books on industry policy, Rekindling the Flame in 2000, and Getting on Track in 2004. From December 1996 until his death, Aldred was the proprietor of one of Australia's major equestrian centres, the Victorian Equestrian Centre (VEC) in Upper Beaconsfield. The VEC offers children's riding clubs, school holiday camps, riding lessons, trail rides, specialised training programs and agistment. The VEC also founded the concept of Interschool Equestrian Challenges, with four of them being run each year.

It was invented by Timor Kadir and J. Michael Brady in 2001 and an affine invariant version was introduced by Kadir and Brady in 2004Zisserman, A. and a robust version was designed by Shao et al.Ling Shao, Timor Kadir and Michael Brady. Geometric and Photometric Invariant Distinctive Regions Detection. Information Sciences. 177 (4):1088-1122, 2007 in 2007. The detector uses the algorithms to more efficiently remove background noise and so more easily identify features which can be used in a 3D model. As the detector scans images it uses the three basics of global transformation, local perturbations and intra-class variations to define the areas of search, and identifies unique regions of those images rather than using the more traditional corner or blob searches. It attempts to be invariant to affine transformations and illumination changes. This leads to a more object oriented search than previous methods and outperforms other detectors due to non blurring of the images, an ability to ignore slowly changing regions and a broader definition of surface geometry properties. As a result, the Kadir–Brady saliency detector is more capable at object recognition than other detectors whose main focus is on whole image correspondence. Introduction Many computer vision and image processing applications work directly with the features extracted from an image, rather than the raw image; for example, for computing image correspondences, or for learning object categories. Depending on the applications, different characteristics are preferred. However, there are three broad classes of image change under which good performance may be required: Fig. 1. Detected regions, illustrated by a centre point and boundary, should commute with viewpoint change – here represented by the transformation H. Global transformation: Features should be repeatable across the expected class of global image transformations. These include both geometric and photometric transformations that arise due to changes in the imaging conditions. For example, region detection should be covariant with viewpoint as illustrated in Figure 1. In short, we require the segmentation to commute with viewpoint change. This property will be evaluated on the repeatability and accuracy of localization and region estimation. Local perturbations: Features should be insensitive to classes of semi-local image disturbances. For example, a feature responding to the eye of a human face should be unaffected by any motion of the mouth. A second class of disturbance is where a region neighbours a foreground/background boundary. The detector can be required to detect the foreground region despite changes in the background. Intra-class variations: Features should capture corresponding object parts under intra-class variations in objects. For example, the headlight of a car for different brands of car (imaged from the same viewpoint). All Feature detection algorithms attempt to detect regions which are stable under the three types of image change described above. Instead of finding a corner, or blob, or any specific shape of region, the Kadir–Brady saliency detector looks for regions which are locally complex, and globally discriminative. Such regions usually correspond to regions more stable under these types of image change. Information-theoretic saliency In the field of Information theory Shannon entropy is defined to quantify the complexity of a distribution p as p \\\\log p \\\\,. Therefore, higher entropy means p is more complex hence more unpredictable. To measure the complexity of an image region \\\\\\\\{x,R\\\\\\\\} around point x with shape R, a descriptor D that takes on values {d_1 ,\\\\dots , d_r } (e.g., in an 8 bit grey level image, D would range from 0 to 255 for each pixel) is defined so that P_{D}(d_i,x,R), the probability of descriptor value d_i occurs in region \\\\\\\\{x,R\\\\\\\\} can be computed. Further, the entropy of image region R_x can compute as : H_{D}(x,R) = -\\\\sum_{i \\\\in (1\\\\dots r)} P_{D}(d_i,x,R) \\\\log P_{D}(d_i,x,R). Using this entropy equation we can further calculate H_{D}(x,R) for every point x and region shape R. A more complex region, like the eye region, has a more complex distributor and hence higher entropy. H_{D}(x,R) is a good measure for local complexity. Entropy only measures the statistic of the local attribute. It does not measure the spatial arrangement of the local attribute. However, these four regions are not equally discriminative under scale change. This observation is used to define measure on discriminative in subsections. The following subsections will discuss different methods to select regions with high local complexity and greater discrimination between different regions. Similarity-invariant saliency The first version of the Kadir–Brady saliency detector[10] only finds Salient regions invariant under similarity transformation. The algorithm finds circle regions with different scales. In other words, given H_{D}(x,s), where s is the scale parameter of a circle region R, the algorithm selects a set of circle regions, \\\\\\\\{x_i,s_i;i=1\\\\dots N\\\\\\\\}. The method consists of three steps: *Calculation of Shannon entropy of local image attributes for each x over a range of scales — H_{D}(x,s) = -\\\\sum_{i \\\\in (1\\\\dots r)} P_{D}(d_i,x,s) \\\\log P_{D}(d_i,x,s)/10; *Select scales at which the entropy over scale function exhibits a peak — s_p ; *Calculate the magnitude change of the PDF as a function of scale at each peak — W_D(x,s) = \\\\sum_{i \\\\in (1\\\\dots r)} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial s}P_{D,}(d_i,x,s) (s). The final saliency Y_D(x,s_p) is the product of H_D(x,s_p) and W_D(x,s_p). For each x the method picks a scale s_p and calculates salient score Y_D(x,s_p). By comparing Y_D(x,s_p) of different points x the detector can rank the saliency of points and pick the most representative ones. Affine-invariant saliency Previous method is invariant to the similarity group of geometric transformations and to photometric shifts. However, as mentioned in the opening remarks, the ideal detector should detect region invariant up to viewpoint change. There are several detector [] can detect affine invariant region which is a better approximation of viewpoint change than similarity transformation. To detect affine invariant region, the detector need to detect ellipse as in figure 4. R now is parameterized by three parameter (s, \\"ρ\\", \\"θ\\"), where \\"ρ\\" is the axis ratio and \\"θ\\" the orientation of the ellipse. This modification increases the search space of the previous algorithm from a scale to a set of parameters and therefore the complexity of the affine invariant saliency detector increases. In practice the affine invariant saliency detector starts with the set of points and scales generated from the similarity invariant saliency detector then iteratively approximates the suboptimal parameters. Comparison Although similarity invariant saliency detector is faster than Affine invariant saliency detector it also has the drawback of favoring isotropic structure, since the discriminative measure W_D is measured over isotropic scale. To summarize: Affine invariant saliency detector is invariant to affine transformation and able to detect more generate salient regions. Salient volume It is intuitive to pick points from a higher salient score directly and stop when a certain number of threshold on \\"number of points\\" or \\"salient score\\" is satisfied. Natural images contain noise and motion blur which both act as randomisers and generally increase entropy, affecting previously low entropy values more than high entropy values. A more robust method would be to pick regions rather than points in entropy space. Although the individual pixels within a salient region may be affected at any given instant, by the noise, it is unlikely to affect all of them in such a way that the region as a whole becomes non- salient. It is also necessary to analyze the whole saliency space such that each salient feature is represented. A global threshold approach would result in highly salient features in one part of the image dominating the rest. A local threshold approach would require the setting of another scale parameter. A simple clustering algorithm meets these two requirements are used at the end of the algorithm. It works by selecting highly salient points that have local support i.e. nearby points with similar saliency and scale. Each region must be sufficiently distant from all others (in R3) to qualify as a separate entity. For robustness we use a representation that includes all of the points in a selected region. The method works as follows: #Apply a global threshold. #Choose the highest salient point in saliency-space (Y). #Find the K nearest neighbours (K is a pre-set constant). #Test the support of these using variance of the centre points. #Find distance, D, in R3 from salient regions already clustered. #Accept, if D > scalemean of the region and if sufficiently clustered (variance is less than pre-set threshold Vth ). #Store as the mean scale and spatial location of K points. #Repeat from step 2 with next highest salient point. The algorithm is implemented as GreedyCluster1.m in matlab by Dr. Timor Kadir Kadir,T GreedyCluster1.m download Performance evaluation In the field of computer vision different feature detectors have been evaluated by several tests. The most profound evaluation is published in the International Journal of Computer Vision in 2006.A comparison of affine region detectors. K. Mikolajczyk, T. Tuytelaars, C. Schmid, A. Zisserman, J. Matas, F. Schaffalitzky, T. Kadir and L. Van Gool. International Journal of Computer Vision The following subsection discuss the performance of Kadir–Brady saliency detector on a subset of a test in the paper. Performance under global transformation In order to measure the consistency of a region detected on the same object or scene across images under global transformation, repeatability score, which is first proposed by Mikolajczyk and Cordelia Schmid in [18, 19] is calculated as follows: Mikolajczyk Schmid, C Firstly, overlap error \\\\epsilon of a pair of corresponding ellipses \\\\mu_a and \\\\mu_b each on different images is defined: \\\\epsilon = 1 - \\\\frac{\\\\mu_a \\\\cap (A^T \\\\mu_b A)}{\\\\mu_a \\\\cup (A^T \\\\mu_b A)} where A is the locally linearized affine transformation of the homography between the two images, and \\\\mu_a \\\\cap (A^T \\\\mu_b A) and \\\\mu_a \\\\cup (A^T \\\\mu_b A) represent the area of intersection and union of the ellipses respectively. Notice \\\\mu_a is scaled into a fix scale to take the count of size variation of different detected region. Only if \\\\epsilon is smaller than certain \\\\epsilon_0, the pair of ellipses are deemed to correspond. Then the repeatability score for a given pair of images is computed as the ratio between the number of region-to-region correspondences and the smaller of the number of regions in the pair of images, where only the regions located in the part of the scene present in both images are counted. In general we would like a detector to have a high repeatability score and a large number of correspondences. The specific global transformations tested in the test dataset are: *Viewpoint change *Zoom+rotation *Image blur *JPEG compression *Light change The performance of Kadir–Brady saliency detector is inferior to most of other detectors mainly because the number of points detected is usually lower than other detectors. The precise procedure is given in the Matlab code from Detector evaluation #Software implementation. Performance under intra-class variation and image perturbations In the task of object class categorization, the ability of detecting similar regions given intra-class variation and image perturbations across object instance is very critical. Repeatability measures over intra- class variation and image perturbations is proposed. The following subsection will introduce the definition and discuss the performance. =Intra-class variation test= Suppose there are a set of images of the same object class e.g., motorbikes. A region detection operator which is unaffected by intra- class variation will reliably select regions on corresponding parts of all the objects — say the wheels, engine or seat for motorbikes. Repeatability over intra-class variation is measuring the (average) number of correct correspondences over the set of images, where the correct correspondences is established by manual selection. A region is matched if it fulfills three requirements: *Its position matches within 10 pixels. *Its scale is within 20%. *Normalized mutual information between the appearances is > 0.4. In detail the average correspondence score S is measured as follows. N regions are detected on each image of the M images in the dataset. Then for a particular reference image, i, the correspondence score S_i is given by the proportion of corresponding to detected regions for all the other images in the dataset, i.e.: Si = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Total number of matches}}{\\\\text{Total number of detected regions}}=\\\\frac{N_{M}^{i}}{N (M-1)} The scoreS_i is computed for M/2 different selections of the reference image and averaged to give S. The score is evaluated as a function of the number of detected regions N. The Kadir–Brady saliency detector gives the highest score across three test classes which are motorbike, car and face. The saliency detector indicates that most detections are near the object. In contrast, other detectors maps show a much more diffuse pattern over the entire area caused by poor localization and false responses to background clutter. =Image perturbations test= In order to test insensitivity to image perturbation the data set is split into two parts: the first contains images with a uniform background and the second images with varying degrees of background clutter. If the detector is robust to background clutter then the average correspondence score S should be similar for both subsets of images. In this test saliency detector also outperforms other detectors due to three reasons: *Several detection methods blur the image, hence causing a greater degree of similarity between objects and background. *In most images the objects of interest tend to be in focus while backgrounds are out of focus and hence blurred. Blurred regions tend to exhibit slowly varying statistics which result in a relatively low entropy and inter-scale saliency in the saliency detector. *Other detectors define saliency with respect to specific properties of the local surface geometry. In contrast the saliency detector uses a much broader definition. The saliency detector is most useful in the task of object recognition, whereas several other detectors are more useful in the task of computing image correspondences. However, in the task of 3D object recognition where all three types of image change are combined, saliency detector might still be powerful.

Destra's interests spanned film, internet, music, theatre and retail, including Magna Pacific. During its peak years, Destra was one of the largest online music distributors in Australia, while also specializing in hosting and domain registry. In the mid 2000s, the company reached $100 million in annual turnover. The company's shareholders included Prime Media, whose stake represented 44% at April 2008. Following the collapse of Opes Prime in 2007, Destra announced they were suffering financially and it went on to lose $76.9 million between 2007 and early 2008. The company was split into a number of divisions before its subsidiaries were sold. Destra became defunct in November 2008. History Domenic Carosa and Anna Carosa founded Destra Corporation in 1993. The Carosas were only teenagers when they came up with the concept, which they originally called Sprint. In its early days, the company owned entertainment websites in Australia and formed Ozhosting.com in 1995 to provide hosting to small businesses. Sprint purchased a number of smaller Australian-based hosting companies over the next couple of years in order to increase its market share in the hosting market. This included BlueFire and also GlobalHost. Both companies remained as separate entities under Sprint but operated under the OzHosting.com brand. In 2000, Sprint Corporation was rebranded as Ehyou in order to expand into other online fields besides hosting. This included the purchasing of mp3.com.au, with the aim of moving more into the online music and digital downloads market. Over the next couple of years, Destra expanded its hosting offerings geographically through acquisitions of Cyberhost, lasiaworks, and Ocean Internet's hosting division. Destra also acquired Webtrader in January 2001, a move which further diversified its services. The company was then integrated under the OzHosting subsidiary, making the hosting brand the second largest retail hosting company in Australia. During 2002, Destra continued to acquire hosting companies, including Enet21 and SuperHosting. Most notably, Destra announced in 2002 that they had acquired a 60% controlling interest in TPP Internet, which was one of Australia's largest domain name registrars at the time. In 2004, the subsidiary OzHosting was integrated into a new part of the business. The OzHosting brand was shelved, and OzHosting and Techex merged to form Destra. During the same year, Destra won the PowerTel Partner of the Year award. During its first year as the Destra brand, the company announced that they had reached a partnership agreement with Yahoo! to create a new suite of services that would be integrated into the subsidiary, OzHosting. In 2005, Destra reported revenue of over $15 million, up 73% from the previous year, with revenues of $15.739 million, up 73 percent. In 2006, Destra was the largest digital music provider in Australia, with more than 1.3 million tracks in its online music catalogue. At the time, the company was strategically developing advertising revenue streams across its websites. After making a number of acquisitions, Destra was greatly affected by the collapse of Opes Prime in 2008. In 2007–08, Destra lost $76.9 million, having made 13 acquisitions in the previous three years. In November 2008, Destra's divisions were sold in administration to companies including Fremantle Media; Central Station Records; Brand New Media; Eddie MacGuire's Visual Entertainment Group; producer of the Discovery Channel's hit show MythBusters, Beyond International; and Domenic Carosa's Dominet Digital.

Its Red Army predecessor fought on the Eastern Front of World War II from 1941 to 1945. It gained fame as a formation, whose soldiers raised the Soviet flag over the Reichstag shortly before the end of the war. The nickname ‘Idritskaya’ was given to the Soviet division on July 23, 1944, by the order № 207 for its heroic battle in the town of Idritsa. The Division fought at Schneidemühl and Berlin. History The Division was formed three times, being initially established at Vyazma in September 1939. As part of the 3rd Army's 3rd Rifle Corps, the division took part in the Soviet Invasion of Poland.

The unit was made up of over 10,000 men from Siberian factories and the Kuzbass coal fields and had a cadre of 1,460 combat veterans. By September 1 it had enlisted 13,754 personnel, 43.8 percent of whom were Communist Party members or Komsomols. Within two weeks it was assigned to the 6th \\"Siberian Volunteer\\" Rifle Corps and began moving by rail to camps near Moscow where it received the last of its support troops and transport. On September 30, the 150th set out on a 170km road march to join the 22nd Army near Belyi in Kalinin Front.Charles C.

On January 6, 1943, the division was pulled from the line and moved by rail to the Velikiye Luki area, where it served in the 5th Guards Rifle Corps during the last few days of the battle for that city, then on the 25th staged an assault crossing of the Lovat and Loknya Rivers. By the middle of February it was back in 6th Corps in 22nd Army. Over the next two months it fought in the Kholm area, pinning down the German forces evacuating from the Demyansk Pocket. On April 16 the Supreme High Command recognized the service of the 6th \\"Siberian Volunteer\\" Rifle Corps by re-designating it as the 19th Guards Rifle Corps, and three days later the 150th became the second formation of the 22nd Guards Rifle Division.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", pp. 57-58 3rd Formation \\"Victory Banner #5\\" was raised just below a statue on the roof of the Reichstag building. The flag reads, \\"150th Rifle, Order of Kutuzov 2nd class, 'Idritskaya' Division, 79th Rifle Corps, 3rd Shock Army, 1st Belorussian Front.\\" It was then re-created for the third time in September 1943. When formed for the third time, it was composed of the 127th, 144th, and 151st brigades. Initially, this division fell under the command of the 34th Army. But during some time in early 1944, it was transferred to the 6th Guards Army, and then finally it was assigned to the 79th Rifle Corps of the 3rd Shock Army, of the 1st Belorussian Front, under which it would stay on the offensive all the way from Nevel, Pskov Oblast to Berlin. On April 22, 1945, when victory for the Soviet Army was near, an order from the Military Council of the 3rd Shock Army designated the 150th Division to be one of 9 divisions to receive a special banner solely for the purpose of raising it over the Reichstag as a sign of the Soviet victory. Red Army photographer Yevgeny Khaldei took the picture of soldiers Kovaliev and another comrade of the Division's 756th Rifle Regiment hoisting the flag (called the Victory Banner) on April 30, 1945, on the roof of the Reichstag building.A largely symbolic move, as the building had not been the seat of German power since the 1933 Reichstag fire An earlier flag had been raised the day before while the building was being fought over with remaining German soldiers. However, as the flag was raised after dusk, there was no chance to take a picture. After taking the shot with the flag Khaldei rushed back to Moscow, and it was later decided that the true persons on the photo, Kovaliev and his comrade, were not politically correct. So they became Meliton Kantaria (a Georgian, like Stalin) and Mikhail Yegorov (a Russian). On April 26, 1945, for its earlier heroic overnight victory at lake Woświn east of Stargard, 150th Rifle Division was awarded the Order of Kutuzov, second degree. In December 1946 the division was disbanded in the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany. 15 personnel were awarded the Gold Star Medal as Heroes of the Soviet Union, while a veteran of the unit was given the Gold Star Medal as a Hero of Ukraine in 2005.

He was a high-ranking official in the pre-war Belgrade police and was involved in the persecution of communists in Yugoslavia during the interwar period. Vujković collaborated enthusiastically with the Gestapo following the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia. He was made Special Police commander at Banjica on 5 August 1941 and was later the victim of a failed assassination attempt by Serbian anti-fascists. As the commander at Banjica, he ordered murders and devised torture techniques. Execution lists were drawn up by him beginning in 1942. Vujković often selected victims, including children, at random, and had murders carried out by members of the Belgrade Special Police and the Serbian State Guard. He is said to have personally participated in interrogations and devised numerous humiliating methods of torture. Executions occurred frequently at his whim and he rarely asked for approval from German or Serbian authorities to carry out murders and ordered prisoners killed even in cases where the Ministry of Interior decided against execution. Vujković is reported to have begged the Germans to \\"personally shoot twenty young girls who were ordered for shooting\\" on one occasion. Despite this, neither he nor any other Serbs holding positions of power in the camp were reprimanded or removed from their posts by the Serbian collaborationist government. When prisoners in Banjica complained of lack of food, Vujković and his associates often replied by saying: \\"[you] didn't come here for spa therapy and food, but to be executed. To eat more or less will not save your lives.\\" Vujković was captured by the Anglo-American forces and extradited to Yugoslavia at the end of the war. In July 1949, he testified before the Yugoslav State Commission and explained that Serbian collaborationist forces saved countless Serb civilians from being executed as German hostages by swapping them with Roma prisoners. He died in 1949.

It was written by New York Times bestselling author Zoey Dean and was released in April 2007. Plot summary The A-List crew has finally graduated and everyone is looking forward to enjoying a carefree summer but Cammie and Anna get caught trespassing and are arrested. Fortunately, the girls only have to help run a charity fashion show for New Visions, an organization to help less- fortunate girls, for their community service. There, they meet a beautiful, petite girl named Champagne, an aspiring model. Virginia Vanderleer, the head of New Visions, warns Cammie and Anna that Champagne was accused of stealing a dress not too long ago and is not to be trusted. However, Cammie takes Champagne under her wing and promises to make her a star while Anna uses her East Coast connections to pull a deal with Lizbette Demetrius, an upscale cosmetics company CEO, who promises to attend the show in person to check out Champagne. Adam Flood has decided to spend the summer in Michigan and even tells Cammie that he might want to attend college there, much to her dismay. Cammie begins to flirt with Ben and the two almost kiss. Ben tells Cammie she has changed and if they ever get back together, it would be so much more than before. Dee is still with Jack Walker but she becomes concerned when their relationship is becoming too serious especially since she finds herself attracted to Aaron Steele, an acquaintance from Ojai. Sam is convinced that Poppy is cheating on Jackson with Bodhi Gilad, her new yoga instructor, and enlists Parker to help her catch Poppy in the act. She offers him a deal: she will secure for Parker a part in her father's remake of Ben Hur and he will seduce Poppy in exchange. She assures him he will be kept anonymous but Parker worries that somehow Jackson will find out and will blacklist him forever in Hollywood. Sam hires a photographer to capture Poppy and Parker kissing but feels guilty afterwards and decides to destroy the pictures. However, a tabloid magazine catches Poppy and Bodhi together and when Jackson confronts her, Poppy breaks down in tears and flees, leaving Ruby Hummingbird behind. Sam is pleased Poppy is finally out of her life and comforts her betrayed father and abandoned half-sister. Clark admits to Cammie that her mother was clinically depressed and committed suicide although she loved Cammie dearly. He leaves Cammie with a letter Jeanne wrote to be read on Cammie's wedding day but Cammie opens it and is touched by the beautiful, emotional letter. With Dee, the girls talk about their relationship woes and Cammie wishes her mother was still around. The two venture up into the attic, where they find Jeanne's old clothes. Cammie finds a familiar outfit and tries it on, finally grieving over the loss of her mother. Dee pleasantly surprises Cammie by offering wisdom and comfort. The New Visions fashion show is a success, especially since the models used were not professionals but under-privileged girls like Champagne. However, when a dress goes missing, everyone is quick to accuse Champagne. Cammie deduces that Martin Rittenhouse, the designer, deliberately hid the dress to drum up publicity. Since Lizbette decided Champagne was not right for her company after all, Cammie coerces Martin to launch a petite fashion line and use Champagne as his star model lest she ruin his reputation. Martin quickly agrees and Champagne is thrilled. During the after party, Cammie calls Adam and gives him an ultimatum: if he is not back in L.A. soon, they are over. Meanwhile, Anna tell Caine and Ben simultaneously, and tells them that she wants to date both of them at the same time. Caine agrees and Ben is incredulous, but eventually he kisses Anna sweetly and agrees, because he doesn't want to lose her. Cammie and Anna congratulate each other for a job well done when Cammie announces to Anna that if it doesn't work out between her and Adam, Cammie will go after Ben.

Published by DAW Books in 1974, it is the third novel in his Green Star Series. In this installment, other (than the one found in the treetop cities such as Phaolon and Ardha) races of Green Star planet humans are introduced. Plot summary As Karn ponders on how to get past Klygon (who Gurjan Tor had ordered to kill him in case of failure), Klygon then tells him that they should escape together—as Gurjan Tor will also kill Klygon a \\"master assassin\\" even more tortuously, and as Klygon has no wish to kill his only remaining true friend. The two escape on their black-painted zaiphs tethering them a short distance outside Ardha (as night travel is extremely dangerous). In the morning, they see a flight of Akhmim's warriors pursuing the sky-sled (which Karn knows they cannot catch, due to its speed exceeding that of any zaiph). When the two set out for Phaolon at a higher altitude, a huge shadow comes over them. Klygon looks toward the shadow's source which turns out to be a dinosaur-sized hawklike bird or zawkaw. They attempt to flee from the zawkaw only to find that its speed exceeds that of their zaiphs; before fleeing Karn observes a beautiful (not in effeminate sense) bald, ebon-skinned human riding it. At that point, Karn finds the zoukar (an invention of the kaloodha, the lightning-emitting wand which Sarchimus had used to kill the phuol) and slays the zawkaw, panicking its rider who falls from its back into the abyss. However, he and Klygon are not able to regain control of their zaiphs till these hit the forest floor (which kills the zaiphs). In the meantime Janchan, Niamh and Zarqa (along with a captive Arjala) prepare to restart after a night spent parked; at this point Arjala's haughtiness comes to the forefront as she criticises the rude breakfast they have—and her feeling of humiliation is aggravated when Niamh reminds her that she (Niamh) too is a Goddess (as Princess/Goddess are integrated in Phaolon). When they restart the sky-sled at high altitude, they see a large floating city from which zawkaw with ebon- skinned riders (similar to the one that chased Karn and Klygon) flying around it. A flight of the zawkaw lands near the quartet, who are taken captive by the riders and taken into the city. There, an old man tells them the city is named Calidar, at which Arjala is initially overjoyed (she had earlier welcomed the ebon-skinned men as her \\"cousins\\", though they gave her no recognition)--but her joy is turned to horror as the old man, Nimbalim of Yoth, informs her that she is viewed as merely another captive. Niamh is thrilled at meeting Nimbalim (whom she had always been told had died a thousand years prior—even his city had been destroyed sometime later by the Blue Barbarians during one of their madness-times). Karn and Klygon have meantime taken shelter, but are disappointed at the forest floor as it provides only some tasteless (though plentiful) food items. They are captured by a tribe of albinos who ride on huge earthworms (known as sluth) and taken into caves in the trees' root-networks. There, they meet a blue-skinned man who identifies himself as \\"Delgan of the Isles\\" (the \\"of the Isles\\" particularly intrigues Karn who has lived entirely in the treetops), to whom Klygon takes an immediate dislike. Karn notices that Delgan is rather refined for a \\"Blue Barbarian\\" (the only race of which he knows having such skin colour). The troglodytes, led by Gor-ya, add Klygon and Karn to their herd of slave tenders of grubs known as ygnoum. Gor-ya also warns them that they must keep the ygnoum safe from enemies he terms kraan. When the kraan (hippo-sized red ants) later attack the troglodytes and slaughter many of the ygnoum, Gor- ya tries to punish Klygon by whipping him to death, but is stopped when Karn thrusts a torch in his face giving him serious burns—for which Karn is sentenced to be killed by the largest of the sluth (suggested to Gor-ya by Delgan). One of the younger of the black men of Calidar, Ralidux, finds Arjala fascinating; he discusses this with an elder, Clyon, who attempts to dissuade him. The travellers (including Nimbalim) plan on escaping Calidar but are initially stymied by the sky-sled's being too small—for which Niamh finds a solution, capturing (and riding) one of the zawkaw. Eventually, Zarqa is able to tap Ralidux' mind and use him to control a zawkaw—on which Niamh and Arjala ride with him. The travellers' escape is detected however, and a flight of the zawkaw-riders armed with a pain-rod (less-powerful version of the zoukar) knocks Zarqa (piloting the sky-sled) unconscious. Janchan then takes control and brings the sky-sled to a stop. Delgan visits the condemned Karn and gives him his weathercloak, witchlight, rapier and zoukar—and tells him to hurry so they can escape. As they do so, the troglodytes awaken the huge sluth which pursues the trio. Karn then pushes a button on the witchlight (warning Delgan and Klygon to cover their eyes), and turns away. The witchlight has one lightning-bright flash which kills the huge sluth—but the reflection on the water's surface blinds Karn. The trio escape in a boat made from a fallen leaf to the inland sea, and land on a small isle—where Delgan strikes Klygon unconscious and robs the two of weathercloak, rapiers and zoukar. Mockingly he states, \\"in my land, I am a king; I go to reclaim my throne\\". Klygon regains consciousness, and he and Karn hear the wings of the zawkaw (piloted by Ralidux, now free of Zarqa's mind-control) overhead. Followed by As the Green Star Rises.

Abilene Reporter-News, 11 Mar 2007. Retrieved 2012-04-27. In this article, which is a review of Lone Stars of David: The Jews of Texas, ed. Hollace Ava Weiner and Rabbi Kenneth D. Roseman (Brandeis University Press), it is stated that Dallas' Jewish population of approximately 45,000 is the largest of any Texas city. Early history German Jews arrived in Dallas as part of the mid-nineteenth century immigration to Texas from the German principalities following their revolutions. They established the city's first Jewish cemetery in 1854. The small but growing Jewish community wanted a permanent religious structure as well as a rabbi to conduct services and to offer religious education for children. In 1872, the \\"Hebrew Benevolent Association\\" was formed, a charity relief organization that also sponsored the city's first High Holiday services. In 1873, several families founded the first congregation in the Dallas area, Jewish Congregation Emanu-El (now Temple Emanu-El), a Reform congregation. The Temple was chartered in 1875. The next year they built a small red brick temple in the Byzantine style at Commerce and Church (now Field) streets in downtown Dallas. The congregation engaged its first rabbi, Aaron Suhler, in 1875 and joined the Union of American Hebrew Congregations in 1906, an association of Reform congregations. Modern history In 1947, a member of the Jewish community in Dallas began printing the Texas Jewish Post. In 1957 the temple moved to its present location in North Dallas. Architects Howard R. Meyer and Max M. Sandfield, with noted California architect William W. Wurster as consultant, received an Award of Merit from the American Institute of Architects for the design of the present structure, which was enhanced by art coordinator György Kepes of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The Handbook of Texas states that, \\"The formal preservation of the history of Texas Jewry goes back to Rabbi Henry Cohen of Galveston and Rabbi David Lefkowitz of Dallas, who set out to interview as many early settlers and their families as possible. They produced a historical account for the Texas Centennial in 1936.\\" Early Merchant Community Many Jewish merchants contributed to the growth of Dallas, often working together for the betterment of the city. Because Jewish merchants were often the prime supporters of the community's cultural institutions and charities, their economic health often dictated the economic health of the city. Local newspapers received most of their income from advertising from Jewish merchants, enabling them to remain independent and impartial in their reporting unlike European newspapers which were often funded by a particular political party. Jewish merchants were often among the largest bank depositors and frequently sat on the boards of local banks.\\"Titche--Goettinger Department Store,\\" Texas Historical Commission Atlas.

It has playground equipment, outdoor sports fields, and objects that are designed by Isamu Noguchi, a Japanese American artist. Visitors can enter the park and use the parking lot for free. Construction began in 1988; the park opened in 2005. It won a number of awards including the Good Design Award in 2002.  History  Before the construction of Moerenuma Park, the place has been used as a garbage reclaimed ground since 1979.Moerenuma Park and Isamu Noguchi - The entire park is considered to be a sculpture Under the Sapporo Circular Greenbelt Concept, a city planning project that aims at developing the urban areas of Sapporo with greenbelts and parks, construction began in 1982. Sapporo asked Isamu Noguchi to design the park. Noguchi's first visit to Sapporo was in March 1988, when the place was still used as a reclaimed ground in part. Impressed with the landscape and the northern skyline, Noguchi contracted the offer from Sapporo government and made the master plan of the park, which includes the concept of \\"park that is considered to be one complete sculpture.\\" On December 30 in the same year, however, right after making a miniature model of the planned park, Isamu Noguchi died of heart failure in New York City, and the park was constructed with his master plan from 1989. In 1990, land reclamation of garbage was totally closed. It had 71.2 ha and 2,736,000 tons of garbage carried to the place until 1990.About Moerenuma Park In 1997, Moerenuma Park made a park twinning agreement with the Bayfront Park in Miami, United States.Sapporo Green Plan (pdf file) The park won the Good Design Award in 2002, 11th Sapporo Urban Scenery Award in 2003, and Hokkaidō Red Brick Architectural Award in 2004. The park was partly open during construction, and on July 1, 2005, the entire construction was completed (although it was initially planned to be complete in 2004). The Sapporo international art festival was held in 2014 and 2017.  Outline  The name \\"Moerenuma\\" (Moere marsh) is derived from the word \\"Moyre pet\\" in Ainu language, which means \\"a slowly flowing river.\\"Moerenuma Park FAQ Moere marsh was in the place long before the park was constructed. The official name of the marsh is Shinoro New River. It is said that river was made because of perpetual flood in the past. It currently connects to the Kariki New River. The Moere marsh is surrounding the whole area of the park ground. The entire area of the park is 1,888,000 m² including the Moere marsh, coming to a total cost of 27 billion yen. The park has 120 pieces of playground equipment, about 3,000 cherry trees, and the parking lots holds 1,500 vehicles.Access to the Moerenuma Park The construction is mainly supervised by Isamu Noguchi Foundation and George Sadao. The biggest symbol of the park is a glass pyramid near the eastern entrance. The pyramid has the nickname \\"Hidamari\\", which means \\"sunny spot\\" in Japanese. The nickname was given in 2002 and selected from 2,340 applications. With a floor space of 5,328 m², the pyramid has three floors and a roof overlooking a large part of the park. The top floor houses the gallery of Isamu Noguchi and the miniature model of the park. A restaurant and museum shop are on the ground floor. The pyramid has an air conditioning system to cool down inside in summer, using snow stored in a neighbouring storage building during winter. Hidamari is also used for workshops and events including the Prestigious International Conference on Music and Perception with a concert by John Kaizen Neptune in 2008 in the rooms on the ground and second floors. The Tetra Mound, an object with triangle stainless steels (one of the creations of Isamu Noguchi) is placed in the western side. Several events have been held in the square close by. The Mt. Moere occupies large part of the park. It is 62 metres high, which enables visitors to overlook the landscape of the park and northern part of the Sapporo city. More playground equipment is near the Forest of Cherry Trees and the Moere Beach, which is a shallow pond open during summer. A 150-metre canal, the Aqua Plaza, is in the centre of the park, and the Sea Fountain is constructed near the canal. The fountain reaches 25 meters high when it jets out, and it is closed during winter. The monument called Music Shell is used as the musical venue. It is shaped to imitate two shells swelling up from the ground — as the name indicates. The park contains sports grounds such as a tennis court, baseball field and athletic field. These are opened from April to November. Registration to use these facilities is required at the management office. Visitors can rent bicycles. In winter, as some facilities in closed; people can enjoy cross-country skiing in the park instead. Courses are set up, which enable visitors to view objects in the park whilst skiing. Cross-country skiing equipment is lent at the office in the glass pyramid. Nearby Close to Moerenuma Park, there is the Sapporo Satoland — a theme park focusing on agriculture and one of the venues of the Sapporo Snow Festival. The Sapporo Community Dome, an indoor stadium which is often used as a venue for some sports events, and the Okadama Airport are close to the park.

Through Williams, Davis met the other members, brothers Josh Farro and Zac Farro, then forming Paramore.

Biographical details  Pickford was born in 1943 in Wiltshire, England.Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz: Dr. Martin Pickford (Accessed Aug 2012) He is the 4th child of Austin Joseph Pickford and Eleanor Margery Pickford née Holman. The family moved to Kenya in 1946. He read for his first degree between 1967 and 1971 in Dalhousie University and took a PhD at the University of London in 1975. Between 1978 and 2003 he worked at Kenya National Museums at the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris and as a Fellow at the University of Mainz, Germany and has since held various visiting professorships. Research in Africa At the time of Orrorin's discovery, researchers wishing to carry out palaeontological research in Kenya were required to be affiliated with an officially sanctioned Kenyan research organisation. Prior to 1993 the only institution with this privilege was the Kenya National Museums, in which Pickford was Head of the Department of Sites and Monuments from 1978 to 1984. As such the museum and its director used to enjoy a monopoly on palaeontological research in Kenya. However, 7 years before the discovery of Orrorin in 2000, following intense pressure from the international community, the Kenyan Government liberalised many facets of the political, economic and bureaucratic life of the country, and this included the monopoly on the country's palaeontological and archaeological resources that the National Museums of Kenya and its director Richard Leakey had previously enjoyed, both prior to, and following, the country's independence in 1963. In 1984, Pickford was congratulated in writing by the then director of the National Museums of Kenya Richard Leakey, with whom Pickford had attended high school in Nairobi, for completing three two-year contracts at the museum. Leakey informed Pickford that it was not possible to renew the contract a fourth time, as at that time there was a government-set limit placed on the quantity of such renewals. Pickford then settled in France, and in 1985, after contacting the Uganda Government, he launched the Uganda Paleontology Expedition. From 1971 to 1978 Pickford had carried out extensive research in the Tugen Hills under a permit issued by the Kenyan Office of the President. During the surveys Pickford and his team found many important fossils ranging in age from 15 million to 2 million years old. In 1974 he found the first hominid fossil from the 6-million-year-old Lukeino Formation (published in Nature in 1975), a lower molar, which is today included in the hypodigm of Orrorin tugenensis.

Set in 1933, the film concerns a group of revolutionaries attempting to overthrow the Cuban government of Gerardo Machado. The story is based loosely on an episode in Robert Sylvester's novel Rough Sketch and draws on historical events. Plot The story draws on events that occurred as part of the political violence that led to the overthrow of Cuban dictator Gerardo Machado y Morales in 1933. In 1932, a violent opposition group, the ABC (abecedarios), assassinated the President of the Cuban Senate Clemente Vazquez Bello. They had constructed a tunnel to reach the Vazquez family crypt in Havana's Colón Cemetery and planted an explosive device there, anticipating that Machado would attend the funeral. The plan failed when the family decided to bury Vazquez elsewhere. The film is about a group of revolutionaries who plot to bring down their corrupt government. The title, chosen by the distributor Columbia Pictures in place of Rough Sketch, identifies how they come together with no prior associations, sharing only their political principles. China Valdez (Jennifer Jones) is a bank clerk who has a brother who distributes anti-government flyers. She watches as a government operative guns him down on the steps of the University of Havana. She vows to kill his assassin, Ariete. At her brother's funeral, Tony Fenner (John Garfield), an American confederate of her brother, tells her to join his anti-government underground group instead of taking revenge on her own. When he learns that China's house borders a cemetery, he devises a scheme to dig a tunnel from China's house to the cemetery, assassinate a senior government official whose family plot is in that cemetery, and then detonate a bomb during the man's funeral, killing the government officials among the mourners. His disparate group of tunnelers includes a dockworkers, a bicycle mechanic, and a graduate student. Much of the movie is devoted to the digging of the tunnel. The tunnelers struggle with the need to kill men who are less than entirely evil and to take the lives of innocent bystanders. Ramon goes mad thinking of these issues, wanders off and dies in a traffic accident. Ariete harasses China, jealous of her relationship with Fenner, who he has learned is actually Cuban by birth. When the tunnel is ready, a prominent government minister is assassinated as planned. As a munitions expert prepares to set the bomb in place, they learn that the burial will not take place in the family tomb as expected. They make plans for Fenner, who by now is well known to Ariete, to leave Cuba. China will get the necessary funds from Fenner's account at her bank. Fenner rages about his failure, about the disgrace of returning to the people who funded his trip with small donations, fleeing as he had as a boy with his father. Only in supporting him at this point does China declare her love for him. China obtains the funds but sends a fellow employee because she is being tailed by one of Ariete's men. But Fenner, unwilling to leave without her, comes to China's house. The film climaxes with a violent shoot-out sequence, followed by the outbreak of revolution and popular celebration.

One critic has noted the film is \\"a barely disguised indictment of U.S. foreign policy\\" as well as a study of \\"the poetry of failure\\" typical of Huston's style. Huston cast Garfield partly because they shared the same political outlook. Most of the film was shot at the Columbia Pictures studio in Los Angeles, with additional second unit work done in Havana. The second unit footage employed locally-hired doubles for Jennifer Jones and other cast members.Steinhart, Daniel. (2019). Runaway Hollywood: Internationalizing Postwar Production and Location Shooting. University of California Press. p. 152-3. . Much of the script was written as filming progressed. According to Peter Viertel, \\"Huston was going through a lot of personal problems at the time, and he was unable to concentrate on the film\\" even though it presented serious challenges: \\"It was a very difficult story with an ending that wasn't exactly considered happy by Hollywood standards.\\" The ending was repeatedly rewritten by a variety of writers, with the final version by Ben Hecht. The supporting players include Mexican film star Pedro Armendáriz as the corrupt police chief, and former silent stars Gilbert Roland and Ramon Novarro as members of the resistance. John Huston makes a cameo appearance as a bank teller. Many of the film's outdoor scenes were shot against rear projections, which are quite noticeable, including views of Havana Harbor, Havana University, Morro Castle, and Colon Cemetery. The film, however, achieves an almost documentary-like feel with its stark black-and-white photography. The film was evidently unavailable for viewing until it was made available for domestic video sale in 2005, long after John Huston's other films became available. During filming, Huston was asked to give Marilyn Monroe, then unknown, a screen test. As a result, he cast her in a small role in his next film, The Asphalt Jungle. Reception John Huston directed the film between two box office successes: Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) and The Asphalt Jungle (1950). We Were Strangers was released in April 1949 and received mixed reviews. In The New York Times, Bosley Crowther praised the physical and psychological realism of the conspirators, but he disliked Jennifer Jones' performance and missed a central romance: \\"the real emotional tinder which is scattered within this episode is never swept into a pyramid and touched off with a quick, explosive spark\\". Reviews in Time and Collier's were more positive, but The Hollywood Reporter denounced its politics: \\"a shameful handbook of Marxian dialectics ... the heaviest dish of Red theory ever served to an audience outside the Soviet\\". The film was withdrawn from theaters shortly after its release. The Communist Party's Daily Worker thought it was \\"capitalist propaganda.\\" American audiences were perplexed by it, its largely Hispanic cast did not resonate with white Americans, and its shocking presidential assassination theme may have offended some sensibilities. Claimed effect on Lee Harvey Oswald According to Priscilla Johnson McMillan's biography of Lee Harvey Oswald and his wife, Marina, Oswald was \\"greatly excited\\" while watching We Were Strangers on television in October 1963, just a few weeks before he assassinated President John F. Kennedy.

The Capet String Quartet was a French musical ensemble founded in 1893, which remained in existence until 1928 or later. It made a number of recordings and was considered one of the leading string quartets of its time.  Personnel  The personnel of the Capet Quartet (other than the leader, Lucien Capet) changed fairly often, and are reported differently in variant sources. The original line-up appears to have included a player named Giron, and during the first decade Henri Casadesus and Marcel Casadesus, uncles of the celebrated pianist Robert Casadesus, played viola and cello within the group, which often rehearsed at the Casadesus household.Capet Quartet Photo In 1903, it had become:Capet Quartet Photo with newer members 1st violin: Lucien Capet 2nd violin: André Touret viola: Louis Bailly violoncello: Louis Hasselmans By 1910 the team was established which survived into the 1920s to make the well-known recordings: 1st violin: Lucien Capet 2nd violin: Maurice Hewitt viola: Henri Benoît cello: Camille Delobelle  Origins  Lucien Capet (b. Paris, 1873) had been a pupil of Morin at the Paris Conservatoire, and appeared as a soloist very widely, especially with the Concerts Lamoureux. He taught at the Bordeaux Conservatoire from 1899 to 1903 and from 1907 in Paris, wrote three string quartets, and a work on the art of bowing. Louis Hasselmans (b. Paris 1878) took first prize in the Paris Conservatoire in 1893, became cellist with the Concerts Lamoureux, and was also a conductor: he later became attached to the Opéra-Comique. In 1924 it was said that the quartet devoted itself mainly to the performance of the Beethoven repertoire, but dedicated a few performances each year to modern music.

The Buckeyes went into the game as the top-ranked team in the country, with a 22-game winning streak under the direction of legendary head coach Woody Hayes. They were also defending national champions. The Wolverines went into the game under a new head coach, Bo Schembechler, who was trying to redefine a college football power that had fallen on hard times. Ohio State was playing for its second straight national title, while Michigan was playing for the Rose Bowl, and the championship of the Big Ten Conference was on the line. The game was witnessed by a (then) stadium-record crowd of 103,588 at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor, and began the highly combative stretch of the rivalry informally known as The Ten Year War. Background Throughout the entire 1969 college football season, Ohio State had been ranked #1 by the AP poll. Ohio State's 1969 football team was dubbed by the media as the \\"greatest college football team of all time\\", with a handful of proven All-Big Ten players and All-Americans, such as quarterback Rex Kern, running backs Larry Zelina, Jim Otis and John Brockington, wide receivers Jan White and Bruce Jankowski, middle guard Jim Stillwagon and defensive back Jack Tatum. Three Buckeye players, including Kern, Otis, and Tatum finished in the top ten of the Heisman Trophy voting in 1969. Leading up to the Buckeyes' meeting with Michigan, Ohio State had never trailed at any point during the 1969 season, and no team had scored more than 21 points on them all season (Michigan State in a 54–21 loss). In addition, Ohio State had not scored less than 34 points in any game and their closest margin of victory was 27 points in a 34–7 win over Minnesota. Michigan was in the process of rebuilding after a period of mediocrity that saw them win only one Big Ten championship between 1951 and 1968; the program, known for the winning traditions under Fielding H. Yost and Fritz Crisler, had seemingly lost its way. Schembechler was hired before the 1969 season, after six successful seasons as head coach of his alma mater, Miami University of Ohio, where he'd won two MAC titles. But the team began the season with an unimpressive 3–2 record, including a loss to in-state rival Michigan State. But they did get a key 30–21 win vs. #9 Purdue on Oct. 11; had Michigan lost, Purdue would have gone to the Rose Bowl (Ohio State could not go due to the Big Ten's \\"no repeat\\" rule) regardless of the outcome of the Ohio State game. Michigan would win their next four games, with a team including quarterback Don Moorhead, fullback Garvie Craw, wingback John Gabler, tailbacks Glenn Doughty and Billy Taylor, offensive lineman Dan Dierdorf and defensive stars Barry Pierson, Thom Darden, Cecil Pryor and Henry Hill. When Schembechler was hired, he set the team goal – beat Ohio State. One advantage Schembechler had was that he had played for Woody Hayes at Miami (Ohio), then coached under him at Ohio State, so he patterned his team after Hayes' 1969 behemoth. There was also a revenge factor from the 1968 game when Ohio State trounced Michigan 50–14, including going for two after their last touchdown in the game's final moments. When asked why he did so after the game, Hayes replied, \\"Because I couldn't go for three!\\" Ohio State was favored by 17 points going into Michigan Stadium on November 22. Due to the Big Ten's \\"no repeat\\" rule in effect at the time, the Buckeyes knew a victory would give them their second consecutive national championship because they could not go to a bowl game. Michigan was playing for a share of the conference championship. To motivate his team, Schembechler had the number 50 (for the 50 points Ohio State scored against the Wolverines the year before) displayed everywhere in the Michigan locker room, and taped to every player's practice uniform.Schembechler and Albom. p.63 In addition, Schembechler said that if Michigan lost, they would not accept the Rose Bowl berth they had essentially clinched because of the \\"no repeat\\" rule. First half Ohio State appeared to take control of the game right from the opening kickoff, when Rex Kern kept the ball and ran for 25 yards on the first play from scrimmage. Jim Otis would carry the next three plays for another first down. The Buckeyes got the ball to the Michigan 11, when the Wolverine defense ended the drive on a fourth down-and-two to take over. Michigan failed to get a first down, and the Buckeyes would get the ball back and get on the scoreboard first, on a 1-yard touchdown run by Otis. A missed extra-point left the score 6–0 in favor of the scarlet-and-gray. Glenn Doughty would return the kickoff to the Michigan 44, and Don Moorhead would lead a drive downfield, primarily getting the ball to tight end and captain Jim Mandich. Once Michigan got the ball to the Ohio State 3, Schembechler called a basic off-tackle play, and Garvie Craw would score to tie it up. The Frank Titas extra-point put Michigan ahead 7–6. This would be the first time since the second quarter of the 1969 Rose Bowl that Ohio State had trailed. Ohio State shook the score off and began a drive that carried over into the second quarter. Kern would lead the Buckeyes downfield again, hitting Larry Zelina and Jan White, who would score and put Ohio State up 12–7. The extra-point was kicked, but Michigan was called for offsides, and Hayes tried for a two-point conversion, which failed. Michigan started the next possession at their own 33. Once they reached the Ohio State 33, Michigan ran a tailback draw, and Billy Taylor gained 28 yards to the Buckeye 5. Two plays later, Craw punched it into the end zone to put Michigan ahead 14–12. After Ohio State went three-and-out on their next possession, punter Mike Sensibaugh kicked to Michigan's Barry Pierson, who began his career game by returning the punt all the way to the Buckeye 3-yard line, sending Michigan Stadium into delirium. Morehead scored two plays later on an option play, and it was 21–12 in favor of the maize-and-blue. The Buckeyes got the ball going again, but their next possession ended on the Wolverine 36. Michigan drove down the field again and Schembechler went for it on a fourth-and-three on the Ohio State 3. Morehead tossed to Mandich for a touchdown, but it was called back on an illegal procedure penalty. Ted Killian kicked the field goal to put Michigan up at the half 24–12. For the first time since October 28, 1967, Ohio State trailed at halftime. Second half The Wolverines got the ball to start the third quarter and began racking up more first downs, only to have the drive end on the Ohio State 30. Killian missed a 47-yard field goal and Ohio State took over, only to have a Kern pass picked off by Pierson. Michigan would go three-and-out and miss another field goal. In what would become a refrain throughout the second half, another Ohio State pass would be picked off, with a third-down pass intercepted again by Pierson, who would this time return it to the Buckeye 35. Killian would miss another field goal try. As the fourth quarter got underway, Hayes realized that his offense needed to play more aggressive and not punt the ball back to Michigan after each possession. Kern was tackled for a loss on the Buckeyes' first drive of the quarter, on fourth down. Michigan got the ball back at the Ohio State 40, and Michigan continued to churn out the yards, getting the ball to the Buckeye 10. Craw went for it on fourth-and-one and failed, keeping Ohio State in the game. Ohio State's offense went three-and-out, then Michigan drove the ball again to the Buckeye red zone. Craw tried to get a first down again and was once again rebuffed. Hayes pulled Kern out of the game and went with his backup at quarterback, Ron Maciejowski. Maciejowski was able to get a first down, but then threw a pass intercepted again by Pierson, his third of the game. Yet another Wolverine possession was stopped, and Killian missed another field goal try. The Buckeyes tried one last-ditch effort to pull within Michigan with 3:12 left in the game, with Maciejowski finding Dick Kuhn. Hayes called a fake punt with Sensibaugh throwing to Zelina to get the first down at their own 38. Kuhn then took another pass in Michigan territory, then Maciejowski threw to Ray Gillian at the Michigan 22. The drive was squashed on the next play when Maciejowski threw an interception to Thom Darden. The Michigan Stadium crowd, sensing a major upset, began screaming and chanting. Michigan tried to run down the clock, but Ohio State stalled with timeouts and got the ball back after a Wolverine punt. With 29 seconds left, Maciejowski fumbled the ball, and it was recovered by Cecil Pryor. The Buckeyes had committed an unheard-of seven turnovers on the day, six interceptions and a fumble. Moorhead took a knee as the crowd counted down the final seconds, then rushed the field in ecstasy. ABC-TV play-by-play announcer Bill Flemming exclaimed, \\"There it is! What has to be the upset of the century!\\"Pennington. p. 31 Schembechler was carried off on players' shoulders (he was accidentally dropped, but Bo noted \\"it was the only thing [they] fumbled all day.\\"), and Jim Mandich was seen being carried, with tears of joy streaming down his cheeks.

Plot The story is based on the 1961 novel by Hans Koningsberger, set at the time of the 1358 uprising of the peasants of northern France known as the Jacquerie. Heron of Fois (Assi Dayan), a student from Paris, crosses territory devastated by the upheaval and the ferocious reprisals of the nobility. He meets with Claudia (Anjelica Huston), the aristocratic daughter of a royal official killed by the peasants, and they attempt to reach Calais. In the novel Heron's intended final destination is Oxford University while in the film \\"the sea\\" less specifically comes to represent an abstract freedom. While differing in their views of the Jacquerie—Heron sympathises with the exploited peasantry while Claudia sees their rising as mindless savagery—the young couple become lovers.

Anjelica Huston had been in the running to play Juliet in director Franco Zeffirelli's adaptation of Romeo and Juliet, but John Huston withdrew her from consideration when he decided to cast her as Claudia in A Walk With Love and Death. Huston felt that she was wrong for the role, and has commented on the experience that her father \\"miscast me first time out and I think he realized that. I was ready to act, but I wasn’t ready to act for him....I was difficult, I didn't want to act with no makeup, although I'd have done it for Franco.\\" Father and daughter had a fractious relationship on set, with the young Anjelica having difficulty learning her lines and focusing, while her father grew more impatient and angry at directing her. Music The musical score was the work of the French composer Georges Delerue. It incorporated medieval folk music themes, making extensive use of lute, harpsichord and recorders. Box Office The film was not a box-office success, although John Huston noted in his autobiography, An Open Book (1980), that it was highly praised in France, where there was a greater understanding of the historical context. According to Fox records the film required $3,900,000 in rentals to break even and by 11 December 1970 had made $825,000. In September 1970 the studio reported it had lost $1,637,000 on the film.Silverman p 259 Reception Some contemporary reviewers considered that the film held up the past as a mirror of the events of 1968, when it was made. Comparisons were variously made with the Vietnam War or the Paris rioting of May/June that year, which required filming to be relocated to Austria and Italy. However a recent and detailed analysis of both novel and film by the essayist Peter G. Christensen concludes that the story is literally a period one, intended to evoke the turbulence of its 14th century setting, rather than illustrating cultural or generational issues of the late 1960s.

During a German counterattack on that day, at Birgel, Germany, one of his legs was severed by enemy fire. He continued to operate his machine gun until the German force withdrew. Neppel survived his wounds, although his remaining leg was badly damaged and had to be amputated. On August 23, 1945, he was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Harry S. Truman in a White House ceremony. During his recovery and rehabilitation at McCloskey General Hospital in Temple, Texas, Neppel was fitted with prostheses and was promoted from sergeant to technical sergeant. He married his fiancee Jean Moore, and was discharged from the Army in 1946. Neppel returned to work at his 240-acre Iowa farm. He earned a bachelors degree and attended graduate school, and worked for the Veterans Administration for 22 years. He served for eight years on the Iowa Governor's Committee for the Employment of the Handicapped, and in 1969 he was a finalist for the President's award for Handicapped Person of the Year. Neppel died in 1987 at age 63 and was buried in Holy Family Cemetery, Lidderdale, Iowa. Medal of Honor citation Sergeant Neppel's official Medal of Honor citation reads as follows: > He was leader of a machinegun squad defending an approach to the village of > Birgel, Germany, on 14 December 1944, when an enemy tank, supported by 20 > infantrymen, counterattacked.

Prostitution is widespread throughout the country. Many brothels and prostitutes operate outside the regulatory system and the regulations have been less strictly enforced in recent years. 25,000 prostitutes were registered in the year 2000. In 2007 it was estimated that 70% of the prostitutes in the country were from Colombia. The country attracts Colombian prostitutes as the currency is the US$ rather than the unstable Colombian peso. UNAIDS estimate there to be 35,000 prostitutes in the country. Quito was the first city in Ecuador to regulate prostitution in 1921, requiring prostitutes to be tested weekly for STIs and the results recorded in the \\"Register of Venereal Disease\\". Testing and any necessary treatment was free to the prostitutes. Guayaquil and Riobamba introduced a similar system of regulation in 1925. In 1939, about 1,000 prostitutes were registered in Quito. In 2015, 6 hotels used for prostitution were closed down by the authorities in the Historic Centre of Quito. Following protests by the sex workers, the administrator of the Central Zone, Joffre Echeverría, pledged to set up a new zone for them to work in. Brothels are known as \\"chongos\\" or \\"licensed centers of tolerance\\". Legal situation There is no law to criminalise sex workers or those who organise prostitutes. The National Health Code of Ecuador requires sex work in brothels to be monitored by the Department of Health. Brothels are required to be registered and sex workers licensed. To obtain a licence (\\"carnet\\"), the prostitute must undergo a medical examination and be free from syphilis, chlamydia and HIV. The prostitutes must be reexamined every 9 – 15 days and the licence updated. If the prostitute tests positive for STIs, their licence is suspended or revoked. The licence resembles a passport and contains a photograph of the sex worker. Prostitutes have demanded that the photographs be removed and the details of STI testing encrypted. Street prostitution is dealt with under public order laws. Sex workers organisations The first sex workers organisation in Latin America, \\"Asociacion de Mujeres Autonomas \\"22nd de Junio\\"\\" (Association of Autonomous Women 22 June) was set up in Machala in 1985. The idea of the organisation came from an idea by a physician working at the clinic where the woman received their check-ups. In 1988, the organisation organised a strike in response to increases in the rent for the rooms the women worked in. The women locked themselves in a brothel for a week to obtain their demands. The success led to an increase in membership. A general strike was organised in 2000 over a number of issues, including the need for better security, better hygiene and stable rent prices. The organisation receives some funding from international women's organisations such as Mama Cash in the Netherlands and the Global Fund for Women in the United States. Organisations have also been set up in other parts of the country. In Quito women who work in brothels have set up \\"Association Pro-Defense of Women (ASPRODEMU)\\", street workers \\"Association For a Better Future\\" and \\"Association 1st of May\\" and transgender workers the \\"Association of Trans Sex Workers of Quito (Aso TST UIO)\\". In Guayaquil there is the \\" Association of Autonomous Female Workers 1st of August\\" and in \\"Association of Women from Milagro Canton\\" in Guayas Province. In April 2005, the \\"Red de Trabajadoras Sexuales del Ecuador\\" (Network of Sex Workers of Ecuador), commonly known as REDTRABSEX, was set up to give a collective voice for all the individual associations. The organisation partnered with the Ministry of Health in 2008 to provide contraception and information on HIV/AIDS to sex workers. Galápagos Islands The Ecuadorian military ensures that there are prostitutes available for their personnel stationed in the Galápagos Islands (part of Ecuador). Just outside the most populated town on the islands, Puerto Ayora, there are 3 brothels. Child prostitution Child prostitution is a widely recognised problem, especially on the seaport of Esmeraldas. A 2002 International Labor Organization report estimated that 5,200 minors were engaged in prostitution. Many child prostitutes have been abandoned or orphaned by one or both parents; some poverty-stricken parents also sell their children, wittingly or unwittingly, into prostitution. More than half of the girls involved in prostitution work in illegal establishments. Most child victims are trafficked internally for prostitution, but some children are also trafficked to other countries, in particular to Venezuela. The victims are usually children who are kidnapped, sold by their parents, or deceived by false employment opportunities. These children are first exploited through prostitution at the average age of 12. As the age of consent in Ecuador is 14 and teenagers can start work at 15, some girls start working as prostitutes in the unregulated sector at 15, or even earlier with false documents. Law enforcement on underage girls working in brothels is lax. In 2006 it was estimated that the average age of entering prostitution was 15. HIV HIV is a problem in the country and sex workers are a high risk group. It was estimated that in 2016 0.30% of the adult population was infected. The sex workers network, REDTRABSEX, partnered with the Ministry of Health in 2008 to provide contraception and information on HIV/AIDS to sex workers. Lack of education and reluctance to use condoms are significant factors in the spread of the infection. Because of the reluctance to use male condoms, sex worker organisations have distributed female condoms. Sex trafficking Ecuador is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to sex trafficking. Ecuadorian men, women, and children are exploited in sex trafficking within the country. Indigenous and Afro- Ecuadorians, as well as Colombian refugees and migrants, are particularly vulnerable to human trafficking. Women, children, refugees, and migrants continued to be the most vulnerable to sex trafficking, but NGOs reported an increase in LGBTI individuals vulnerable to or victims of sex trafficking. Nationals of Cuba, Ghana, Cameroon, Nigeria, Chad, China, Pakistan, the Dominican Republic and Haiti, initially lured by smugglers promising a better life, have documents confiscated, debts imposed, and are forced into prostitution. Ecuador is also a destination for Colombian, Peruvian, Dominican, Venezuelan, Mexican, Haitian, Paraguayan, and Cuban women and girls exploited in sex trafficking. Traffickers used Ecuador as a transit route for trafficking victims from Colombia, Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. Sex traffickers use emotional relationships and job offers to recruit victims and prey on vulnerabilities such as prior domestic and sexual violence. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons class Ecuador as a Tier 2 country.

In traditional archery practice outside of Western Europe the variations of the thumb draw are by far the most dominant draw types with the Mediterranean draw restricted to Olympic style of target shooting.

This is often called the \\"primary draw/release\\"; the advantage of this draw is that the release is very clean; when the pull reaches a certain point, friction can no longer hold the arrow and it flies free. However, this release prevents the drawing of a stiff bow unless the archer possesses enormous strength in the fingers. It is now of historical interest, but was widespread in traditional archery in the Americas and is seen (with the Mediterranean draw) in the earlier Assyrian reliefs of Ashurnasirpal II. Among Greek archers it was probably the most common draw until the end of the Classical period.The shooting methods of the archers of the Ancient Greek World 1400 BC – 400 BC. Spyros Bakas.

These variants were also used in the Americas, appear on the reliefs of Sennacherib, and have been described from Thailand and the Andaman Islands.  Mediterranean draw and release  A Mediterranean draw This is accomplished by the forefinger on the string above the arrow, and the middle and ring finger on the string below the arrow. The arrow is normally placed on the left side of the bow for right handed archers and on the right side for left handed archers. The modern thought on the draw is to keep effort in the hand at a minimum. The only work the hand has to do is the effort required to keep the bowstring on the fingers. The wrist is to be either straight or flexed away from the archer. This allows for the least tension in the hand, and thus a faster relaxation of the hand at release. This generally results in a more accurate and consistent shot. The nock of the arrow is held on the bowstring between the forefinger and middle finger to help stabilize the arrow before loosing. The Mediterranean draw and its variants are the main traditional form in Europe; it is also native to the Middle East, appearing on Assyrian carvings at all periods.Ancient and modern methods of arrow-release. Edward S. Morse, Director, Peabody Academy of Science. Bulletin of the Essex Institute vol. XVII Oct-Dec 1885. Reprinted 2002 by the Dyfi Valley Bookshop. The Hadza, who do not use quivers, may hold other arrows with the free thumb and little finger.Marlowe, 2010. The Hadza: Hunter-Gatherers of Tanzania. Illustrated by front-cover photo.  Variations  There are variations of this that include the use of only two fingers, sometimes referred to as being the \\"Flemish\\" release. This may allow for a cleaner release. However, more pressure is put on the two fingers, resulting in more strain. Currently, this draw method is little used in Western archery but widespread in Eastern European archery where it is often referred to as the \\"Hungarian draw\\". The two-finger release is, as might be assumed, common in Hungarian archery, and is taught by several prominent modern teachers of traditional horse and foot archery techniques. The two-finger release can be used on either side of the bow, but is primarily used with a left hand side nocking position bow for mounted and foot use. The two-finger draw in its Hungarian form can be found in historical records into antiquity amongst Scythian archery and through into the Middle Ages in eastern European manuscripts and art. Barebow and longbow archers often have the index, middle and ring fingers on the string all below the arrow, a method referred to as \\"three under\\". This brings the arrow closer to the eye, facilitating \\"point of aim\\" and instinctive shooting, and allows the archer to use the \\"string walking\\" aiming technique. An Asiatic variation of this draw (the long Sassanid draw) uses only the middle and ring fingers on the string underneath the arrow using a specialised finger tab, with the index finger used to stabilise the arrow during the draw but not touching the string.  Thumb draw and release  Thumb draw The thumb draw uses only the thumb, the strongest single digit, to grasp the string. The index and/or middle fingers close over the outside of the thumb to reinforce the grip. This is often called the \\"Mongolian draw/release\\", but it is traditional for all ethnicities across the Asian steppes, extending to Korea, China, Russia, Persia and Turkey.Ancient and modern methods of arrow-release. Edward S. Morse, Director, Peabody Academy of Science. Bulletin of the Essex Institute vol. XVII Oct-Dec 1885. Reprinted 2002 by the Dyfi Valley Bookshop. It is typically used with a thumb ring for protection of the thumb pad and joints. It was also used by Ishi, the last of the Yahi, with his short bows. This draw was also used by the Romans and Byzantines, and it is mentioned in Byzantine manuals. It gives a narrower grip on the string, as only one digit is used, and this may help to avoid \\"string pinch\\" with shorter bows such as the composite bows normally used from horseback. It may also avoid a problem occasionally faced by archers using the Mediterranean release, when the three fingers do not release at exactly the same time and thus foul the draw. It also positions the string further back in the hand, allowing a longer draw, all else being equal. This release is normally used with the arrow on the right side of the bow for a right-handed archer, and on the left side of the bow for a left-handed archer. Japanese draw and release Traditional Japanese archery uses a unique type of thumb draw called torikake. It employs a three or four-fingered leather glove with a grooved piece of horn sewn into the crouch of the thumb. The draw starts with the thumb wrapping around the string just below the nocking point so the string seats in the horn groove. Then the index finger, middle finger and (in some styles) ring finger bend down and squeeze the string against the thumb groove. The Japanese draw tends to be very long compared to Western styles, pulling several inches past the archer's ear.  Equipment  Protective equipment is normally used to protect the skin of the digits used. For the Mediterranean draw, the fingers may be protected with shooting gloves or by finger tabs. A shooting glove is a three- fingered glove that goes on the primary hand of the shooter. Models range from full-finger leather to gloves that only cover the tips of the fingers. These gloves are used mostly by traditional and bare-bow shooters. Finger tabs are pieces of material that are attached via leather straps or holes to the middle finger. For amateurs a plain tab made of leather is a simple, cheap, and still highly effective protection for the fingers. Thumb rings or leather thumb tabs are used by archers practising the Mongolian release. Most cover and protect the skin of the thumb only. The Japanese yugake is a reinforced glove with a special ridge which holds the string. In the past 25 years, with the advent of the compound bow, mechanical releases have become popular. The mechanism is usually attached to the wrist; it holds the string, and releases it when triggered. They offer a cleaner release and require no finger strength. However, finger releases must be used for bows other than compounds in most tournaments (including the International Archery Federation) and thus are still widely used. Mechanical releases factor out any kind of finger strength, allowing for a stronger pull as the weakest point in drawing back a bow is the fingers. Some drawbacks to these devices are the need for consistent equipment (any change in equipment can lead to slight deviation and require the archer to take a period to adjust his shot) and the slight decrease in draw length. Bow sling or wrist sling is used to allow the archer to resist the bow instead of actively holding it. If also using a stabilizer it should force the bow to fall forward as the sling catches it. This form is dominant in Olympic Style archery and proper form for Mediterranean release of a recurve bow. Other releases include: * Gemini ring (Roman) * African shooting-cross of the Tengelin * shooting-tablet / Czech bow puller  References  General references  Ancient and modern methods of arrow-release.

He also placed second in the European championships on three occasions. Olympics He competed for Denmark at the 1906 Intercalated Games, in the Greco-Roman heavyweight class and in an open weight class for all Greco-Roman competitors. In the very first round of the heavyweight class he faced the Austrian wrestler Arnold, who he considered to be his greatest threat in the competition. After an hour of wrestling, Jensen emerged victorious. In the second round he faced Ronti, of the German team who weighed in excess of 120 kilograms (264 lbs). Following a victory against the German, he faced and defeated the Belgian Debouis and then Bauer from Austria in order to win the gold medal in the heavyweight class, at which point King George I of Greece called out to him in congratulation. Following that gold medal, he competed once more in the open competition, winning that competition as well and a second gold medal. He competed at the following two Olympic Games, winning the bronze medal in the Greco-Roman super heavyweight event at the 1908 Summer Olympics and another bronze medal this time in the Greco-Roman heavyweight competition at the 1912 Summer Olympics. At the 1912 Games he actually made it to the deciding match to find out who would win the gold medal, against Finland's Yrjö Saarela. After three hours of wrestling in the open air, Jensen retired from exhaustion on a particularly hot day. Legacy Although he won Denmark's only wrestling gold medal at an Olympic Games, those Games are no longer considered to be a true Olympic Games and instead is referred to as the 1906 Intercalated Games.

Mexican immigrant Carlos Amparan developed a line of brilliantly colored fine art acrylic paint after experimenting with this relatively new water-borne emulsion. He and his brother Raoul began small-scale production of Nova Color and sold it at a low price to local artists. Inexpensive and readily available, Nova Color helped fuel the explosion of the Southern California Mural Arts and Chicano Mural Arts movement in the late 1960s, 1970’s and 1980’s. Powerful artwork was made on a large scale. Cities began mural painting programs such as the Los Angeles Citywide Mural Project to promote community development and renewal. Although originally designed as an artists’ easel paint, Nova Color proved to be a remarkably long lasting architectural paint for outdoor murals and decorative finishes. Nova Color developed a loyal following among artists who loved the strong colors that were affordable.

Agros is one of the most interesting villages of Cyprus and the Pitsilia area. The village is located 45 minutes away from the cities of Nicosia and Limassol, 20 minutes from Troodos Square and 80 minutes from the international airports of Larnaca and Paphos. History The village of Agros was named after the Monastery of Megalos Agros, which was built at the spot where the Church of Panayia of Agros is found today. According to tradition 40 monks from Cyzicus of Asia Minor, during the era of Byzantine Iconoclasm abandoned the Monastery of Megalos Agros and arrived in Cyprus carrying the icon of the Holy Mother. They ended up at the area where Agros is located today, stayed for a certain period in a cave. They built a new monastery naming it Monastery of Megalos Agros after the name of monastery they left in Minor Asia. In 1692 A.C. death virus spread all over the island causing death to of the population. The survivors left their houses and moved close to the monastery. So a new village was formed with the name of Agros. Finally in 1894 the monastery was ruined leaving the village a great historical inheritance. National Contribution The village of Agros was always present to all national fights. The patriotism and strength of the people of Agros were recorded on the pages of the Greek and Cypriot history. Following there is a report on the contribution of the people of Agros to the national fights based on a relevant chapter of the book “Agros, I Eptalofi tis Pitsilias”*. Greek Revolution 1821 After the tragic events of the 9th of July 1821, the Exarch of the Metropolis of Kiti sought shelter in Agros. In particular, he undertook the managing of the property of the Monastery of Agros. Later on, however, the exarch decides to seek shelter in the Monastery of Kykkos, but the Turks search for him at the Monastery of Agros. When the latter find the Monastery closed, they take it out on the tax collector of Agros, Constantinos Kemitzis, who chose not to testify of having known about the exarch. The Turks, according to Hadjipetris, “crumpled the tax collector in a large chair and threw him down a very deep and steep cliff where he was tragically killed”. What was particularly sad is the fact that when the exarch returned to the village, not only did he behave like a tyrant, but he would also embezzle the Monastery's incomes. Greek-Turkish War According to the research of Petros Papapolyviou which is cited in the book of Hadjipetris, three men from Agros were volunteers in the Greek-Turkish war. Balkan Wars Unfortunately, our evidence is insufficient regarding the participation of the people of Agros in the Balkan Wars. However, we do know that some people from Agros participated in the Balkan wars and then in World War I. Additionally, the people of Agros also contributed to the wars financially. In particular, according to the data of Papapolyviou's research, the contribution of Agros was 7 pounds and 13 cents. upright=1.3 World War I As we have already mentioned, the people of Agros who participated in World War I were the same fourteen who had fought in the Balkan wars. However, it is believed that there had been more people from Agros who took part, possibly expatriates who lived in Nicosia, Lemesos or even abroad. Most of them served in the Health Services or as mule drivers. The people of Agros who participated in the Balkan wars, as well as in World War II were: Philippos Gregorides Petros Kitromilides Augoustis Savvas Lefteris Kyriakos Konstanti Kalimeras Savvas Avloitos Aristodemos Constantinou Cleanthis Mappourides Sophronis Grousos Cleanthis Savva (Machos) Sophocles Michaelides (Kenevezos) Savvas Hadjisavvas Loukaides Kyriacos (mechanic) Sophocles Koufides (sanitary) Neoclis Shipillis Union Referendums of 1921 and 1930 On March 25, 1921, the priests, teachers, Land Committee and School Committee signed the Unification Referendum because, in the meantime, they had become public servants. The main demand of the referendums was the Unification of Cyprus with Greece. Octovbriana (The uprising of October 1931) The imposition of custom duties by the British government, in combination with its denial to satisfy the motion for unification and the difficult financial conditions of that period on the island, constituted the basic causes for the Cypriots’ uprising in October 1931 (Octobriana). During the uprising, protesters burned down the Government- house and the English responded with shootings. The first victim of the shootings was Onoufrios Clerides, aged 17, from Agios Theodoros of Agros. Clerides originated from the village, and especially from the family of Nearchos Clerides. World War II The participation of Agros in World War II was massive. Among the people of Agros who participated were Glafkos Clerides, former president of the Republic of Cyprus, and Andreas N. Tzionis. The former served as a flight-sergeant in the British Air-force, whereas the latter in the U.S. Army. Moreover, as Hadjipetris remarks, “the father of the former President Mr Ioannis Clerides, his brother Xanthos, as well as the children of Nearchos Clerides, Lefkos and Phoebos Clerides also fought in World War II”. K. Leonidas was killed in battle, and Varnavas Savva and Stelios Kalli were seriously wounded. The grave of K. Leonidas is located in Tobruk of Libya. EOKA Fight The action of Agros in the liberating fight of EOKA against the British colonisers was extremely important. From the beginning of the fight, Agros was the command centre of the Pitsilia region. Gregoris Afxentiou guided the guerrilla fighters of the entire Troödos area from Agros. The people of Agros who participated in the EOKA fight were more than a hundred. In this text it is impossible to even mention them all. Cited in brief below are some reports from Hadjipetris about the contribution of the people of Agros in the fight. The first sector-head for Pitsilia, Renos Kyriakides, visits Agros in 1955 and in particular the home of the head of Agros, Diomedes Mavroyiannis. A few days later, they establish the Youth of EOKA called ANE, in Apeiteio Gymnasium. ANE developed significant activity to a degree that, as Renos Kyriakides remarks, “the English began to deal with the activity of ANE of Agros instead of hunting down guerrilla fighters”. The first student protest of the Apeiteio Gymnasium took place on April 30, 1955, after the arrest of their fellow student Costas Pissarides. For this daring action of them, the students were charged by the British for “having paraded in Agros without a written permit by the Commander of Lemesos”. In several residences of Agros there were many guerrilla hideouts. The first guerrilla hideout was in the home of Kyriacou Polykarpou. Stylianos Lenas would manufacture grenades there. When the hideout was compromised, Lenas continued to manufacture grenades in a hideout in another village. As we have already said, the headquarters of Agros was also in a hideout in Agros. The first ever curfew in Cyprus was imposed in Agros on August 17, 1955. On June 14, 1956, the son of our community, Petros Eliades, is seriously wounded by an English soldier's fire gun the moment he was ready to throw a bomb. This brave man of Agros died on the following day. More: Heroes Monument Also important was the contribution of Andreas Vasileiou, who, before he became a guerrilla fighter, had caused a serious strike to the British Air-force. In particular, on November 26, 1957, he placed bombs and destroyed four Canberra bomber aircraft and a Venom pursuit plane. This sabotage is considered to have been the biggest one of the liberating fight. There were many guerrilla fighters from Agros, some of which were sentenced to prison and others were kept as political prisoners without a trial. During the entire fight, the people of Agros had an enormous contribution to it. Hadjipetris writes: “The participation of the people in the passive resistance and the operation of an arbitration court, whose president in Agros was Papairacles Tsaggarides, had a remarkable success”. The last curfew was imposed in Agros and Agridia on January 22, 1959, when the women of these two communities threw stones against English soldiers. The contribution of women to the Liberating Fight against the colonization is honoured with the construction of the Cypriot Woman Fighter's monument, which is a devout offer to the memory and honour to the woman fighter of the 1955 generation in the region of Pitsilia. The expatriate people of Agros also contributed to the fight from the cities where they lived in (from Nicosia, Lemesos or elsewhere). Turkish mutiny of 1963 A group of men from Agros participated in the resistance against the Turkish mutiny of 1963. These were: Panayiotis Gerasiotis, Petros Sofroniou, Stavros Mathaiou, Leandros Tsolakis and Andreas Pissarides. Turkish Invasion of 1974 In a speech of his, Renos Kyriakides writes according to Hadjipetris: “It was not possible for this village not to stand worthy of the circumstances of the time. Five young men of Agros sacrificed their lives in the fight against the Turkish invaders”. These were: Christophoros Pissarides, Antonakis Tsolakis, Yiannakis A. Mavrou, Nicos Hadjipavlou, and Antonakis Adamou Agrotis. Climate Agrotourism Local tourists were attracted to Agros from the early stages of Cyprus Agrotourism inception. Accommodation can be found at traditionally built hotels, as well as at many bed and breakfast rooms in traditional homes. The village maintains its traditional character and offers a natural and built with significant historical, religious and cultural sites. Local visitor attractions include the views of the mountain, walking in the village narrow streets, natural trails, the traditional local food and wine served at traditional taverns and the produce of the village promoted by the in-house shops of the local enterprises. Rose bushes Cultivation Agros roses bush - of the species Rosa damascena – owe its proliferation to the late Nearchos Klirides who in 1917 as a school teacher in his native village of Agros founded the \\"Pupils Association for the Dissemination of the Rose bush\\" and introduced an incentive scheme targeting the expansion of the cultivation of the rose bush with the aim of producing rose water. According to Klirides vision, this would contribute to a substantial improvement of the standard of living of the local community. In May, visitor-volunteers participate for the gathering of the roses. Heroes and monuments The village of Agros has built a monument near “Apeitios High School” to honor the hero Petros Iliadis. The monument is a copper bust based on a marble base. Petros Iliadis was born in Agros in 1932. He went to the elementary school of the village and continued his studies in Apeitios high school, where now lies his monument. His parents, Ilias Louka and Panayiota Ilia created a big family and gave to their children strict values for life. Petros had five siblings: Andreas, Foinikou, Cleopatra, Ellada and Eleftheria. When Petros finished school, he left for the capital where he worked as a grocer. He was also a member of a Christian Union (OXEN). Some years later he became a member of EOKA which was a team fighting against the British. He was in the same team with Iakovos Patatsos and Panayiotis Georgiadis, two other great heroes. He was responsible for the recruitment of the team as well as to hide and transport secret weapons and mail. He was a strong person both in body and soul, so he decided to recruit the assault team of Nicosia which was in real need of fighters. On 14 June 1956 he participated in a bomb attack against the British. The attack took place in the main post office. Petros tried to approach the building but an English guard saw him and shot him. He managed to walk for some meters and the other members of his team took him to the hospital. The doctors gave their best but it was too late. The bullet went through his right lung and his stomach. He died the next morning, on 15 June, and was buried in Agros some days later. Churches Church of \\"Panagia Eleousa\\" Panagia Eleousa, Agros, Cyprus The so-called «Agios Theofanis en to megalo Agro» (Saint Theofanis in the Great Agros) was firm fighter of the Byzantine Iconoclasm and prior of what was then the Monastery of “Panagia Eleousa” (Blessed Virgin Mary the Merciful). He came from Asia Minor, where during Iconoclasm he was condemned and driven away. He was exiled to Samothraki in 817 AD where he died. From 817 until 842 (the era of Iconoclasm) this firm supporter faithfully performed his duties. The prior was condemned because he rejected the Imperial Decrees, which turned against the icons. The monks living with him in the same monastery (preserving the same name that was dedicated to “Panagia Eleousa”) in Asia Minor, decided to come to Cyprus after his death. Having come to Cyprus, they resided in a cave in the region of the village Agros for some period. It is not known for how long they stayed in the cave. In 817 they also brought the icon of “Panagia Eleousa” to the monastery in the Agros village. The monastery, being packed with monks, was in operating regularly. Later on, between the 16th and 17th century, a large-scale epidemic of the deadly disease cholera struck the area. In order to protect themselves from the epidemic, all the inhabitants moved and constructed their houses right outside the monastery, under the wing of the Virgin Mary. Thus the village of Agros was created. The monastery properly functioned until 1830. Afterwards, the monastery no longer hosting any monks, the Metropolitan Diocese started to let out the monastery's cells. To some degree they were exploiting the monastery. This tactic continued until 1880. We ought to mention that during the Turkish domination people granted their estates to the monastery so as to avoid the taxes that were enforced on them. However, the inhabitants rose up and started having claims themselves. One of them had suggested that if the monastery got demolished then the Diocese would no longer preserve its rights. And so it was done. In 1894 they demolished the monastery. When the Metropolitan Bishop went to perform a liturgy in the monastery he found himself facing it demolished in astonishment. This was not accepted by the Metropolitan Diocese and as a result they imposed a fine on the inhabitants. In that same year and right on the same spot, the inhabitants started building today's church, which still exists now at the center of the Agros village, at their own initiative. The operations ended in 1909. It is a cross-like structure with a dome. It is quite a big church that can accommodate up to 1500 of the faithful. Externally it is made of local stone. The Church is 97 feet long and 48 feet wide. The dome's height is 49 feet and the surrounding wall is feet thick. The steeple is a real sight, tall and adjacent to the church's north-east corner, bearing three large bells. Internally it is whitewashed but with no hagiographies. The High Altar remains the same, having been saved during the demolition of the monastery. The icon screen it the church's special treasure. It is woodcut. It bears carefully made, beautiful icons of the saints that were made by the renowned hagiographer Solonas Fragkoulis from 1930 until 1934. Inside it is flat and quite spacious, a women's loft having been added. The women's loft was constructed later on in 1955. The icon dedicated to the Virgin Mary is still in existence and it is quite old (1856). This icon was covered by a silver, painted cover. This was kept until 1987 when the unveiling of the holy icon was performed. This icon has been preserved and today it can be found in the nearby little church, which was constructed in 1990 so as to remind the existence of the “Monastery of Great Agros” in this area. Along with this old icon, there are some other extant items from the monastery such as a piece of the icon screen and the icon of Christ. It celebrates on the 21st of November, the day of the Virgin Mary's Presentation to the Temple. A large fair takes place and many are the faithful that come to kneel before Her holy icon. The Church of “Timios Prodromos” church of “Timios Prodromos” , Agros, Cyprus East of the village, in the midst of the traditional houses, the church of “Timios Prodromos” (John the Baptist) was constructed around 1860. It is due to the initiative and the contributions of the inhabitants that it was made. It is of the Basilica style with tiles on the roof. It is 100 feet long and 25 feet wide. It is unique throughout Cyprus with regards to its length. The Church's inauguration was done in 1892. In 1984 the roof had to be replaced since the passage of many years and the plentiful water of rain that gradually penetrated had caused serious damages, thus deeming its replacement necessary. Externally a low-rise wall that is coated with local stone surrounds it. The yard is comfortable and also covered with local stone. Two note-worthy fountains, coated with stone, were constructed in 1990. One is in the east of the yard and the other in its west. Inside there are some hagiographies such as that of “Panagia Platytera” over the chancel. The rich in chasings, wooden icon screen was made in 1914. The two gates, the “Oraia Pyli” (“the Beautiful Gate”, central) and the north gate (to the right), are formed in the icon screen. Inside it is flat. In 1960 they paved a new floor, the former one with the old slates no longer being able to sustain trampling by the believers. The dedicated icon dates back to 1887 and it is found on the icon screen right next to the holy icon of Christ. It celebrates with a fair on the 29th of August, the holy icon of the Saint being carried about in procession. Frangoulides Museum Frangoulides Museum, Agros, Cyprus One of the most important museums of the island is the “Museum Fragoulides” and it is built near the church of Panagia in the village Agros. The museum was founded in 2004 to honor Solomos Fragoulides (l902-1981), who was one of the greater representatives of the first generation of Cypriot artists. He is also considered a pioneer painter and hagiographer. The love between the painter and the inhabitants of the village was mutual and it grew during the stay of Fragoulides in Agros from 1932 to 1934. The painter writes in his biography: “Concerning my painting, the two years I have spent in Agros, were the happiest of my entire life. I felt loved by the people here...”. The village returned this love by building the museum in his memory. His work has both an artistic and religious value. He was the hagiographer who undertook the painting of all the portable icons of the church of Panagia. The idea for the foundation of the museum belongs to Solon Papachristodoulou who was actually the god child of the painter as well as his only heir. He inherited all his fortune, reports, patterns, unfinished paintings, paintings, several materials and accessories for painting but also his rich record. Fragoulides explains in his biography how he met Solon. He says that a young couple asked him to become the best man at their wedding and then christen their child. And he did so. He also decided to name the baby after his own name, Solon. Solonas in corporation with the “Association of Farmers and Friends of Agros”, the members of the Executive Council and the help of the entire village organized the museum. The building was donated by the church. Traditional Arts/Occupation The rosewater In the village of Agros, there are roses that the locals use them to produce rose water. Rose water is produced from which is a special cultivation of roses. The wide spread of these roses was made by Nearchos Kliridis who brought to the village the first still, which is necessary for the production of rose water. The traditional way of rose water production requires the use of a still which is composed of a cauldron and a barrel. The barrel must be full of water. The roses are placed in the cauldron with plenty of water. For every kg of roses, about kg of water must be added. In the meanwhile, the fire is turned on and the mixture in the cauldron is simmering. The steam which is created is going through a copper pipe into the barrel. In the barrel, the steam is liquefied and become rose water with incredible scent. For each kg of roses which is used in this procedure, of rose water is finally produced. Traditional sweets The area is also popular for its traditional sweets. The most common are the sweets with syrup. There are around 40 to 50 kinds of sweets in syrup, such as the walnut, the cherry, the water melon, the grape, the quince and the rose. The inhabitants of Agros claim that the sweet made of rose is very good for health as it can cure several illnesses. The majority of the visitors prefer the sweet made of walnuts (). The manufacture of these sweets lasts two days. They are put in syrup which is made of water and sugar. In the village, one can find some more traditional Cypriot desserts, like mahallebi and loukoumades. The former one, is usually prepared during summer and it is served cold. The latter is a deep fried dough, soaked in syrup. While these pastry products can be found in many places in Cyprus, the traditional Agros recipe demands to be flavored with local rosewater. Meat products The meat products which are produced in Agros are very special and known for their taste and scent. They are usually salted or smoked and they are produced with the traditional Cypriot recipes. Some of these products are the \\"chiromeri\\", the \\"lountza\\", and the \\"bacon\\". These three products are made of pork meat, wine and salt. The \\"chiromeri\\" is put in salt, later on is put in wine and then in the (a traditional tool) where it is pressed so that the liquids of the meat come out. The entire procedure lasts 3 months. In the lountza and bacon a special spice is added, the coriander which offers a lovely scent. The preparation of these two meat products lasts two weeks. Firstly the meat is put in wine and salt and coriander and then in the . Another popular and traditional product of Agros are the sausages. They are made of mince pork meat, wine, salt, coriander and other spices. They are also put in the and they are ready in a week. Pastourmas is a kind of sausage which is prepared in Agros and it is also very popular. It is made of beef, a variety of spices, garlic and salt. The preparation lasts 3 days and when it is finished, the is left under the sun for several days. Undoubtedly, the small industries of meat products in Agros have managed to rescue the traditional recipes of pork products with great success.  2005 Helvetia Cup  The 2005 Helvetia Cup or 2005 European B Team Championships in badminton was held from January 19 to January 23 in Agros, Cyprus.

Prior to that, he briefly served as Vice President of Autopilot Software at Tesla, Inc. and worked at Apple Inc. as Senior Director of the Developer Tools department, leading the Xcode, Instruments, and compiler teams.  Background  Lattner studied computer science at the University of Portland, Oregon, graduating in 2000. While in Oregon, he worked as an operating system developer, enhancing Sequent Computer Systems's DYNIX/ptx. He is married to compiler engineer Tanya Lattner, who co-founded and is president and COO of the LLVM Foundation since 2015.  LLVM  In late 2000, Lattner joined the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as a research assistant and M.Sc. student. While working with Vikram Adve, he designed and began implementing LLVM, an innovative infrastructure for optimizing compilers, which was the subject of his 2002 M.Sc. thesis. He completed his Ph.D. in 2005, researching new techniques for optimizing pointer-intensive programs and adding them to LLVM. In 2005, Apple Inc. hired Lattner to begin work bringing LLVM to production quality for use in Apple products. Over time, Lattner built out the technology, personally implementing many major new features in LLVM, formed and built a team of LLVM developers at Apple, started the Clang project, took responsibility for evolving Objective-C (contributing to the blocks language feature, and driving the ARC and Objective-C literals features), and nurtured the open source community (leading it through many open source releases). Apple first shipped LLVM-based technology in the 10.5 (and 10.4.8) OpenGL stack as a just-in-time (JIT) compiler, shipped the llvm-gcc compiler in the integrated development environment (IDE) Xcode 3.1, Clang 1.0 in Xcode 3.2, Clang 2.0 (with C++ support) in Xcode 4.0, and LLDB, libc++, assemblers, and disassembler technology in later releases. Lattner's recent work involves designing, implementing, and evangelizing the LLVM and Clang compilers, productizing and driving the debugger LLDB, and overseeing development of the low-level toolchain. As of 2016, LLVM technologies are the core of Apple's developer tools and the default toolchain on FreeBSD. In June 2010, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Special Interest Group on programming languages (SIGPLAN) gave Lattner its inaugural ACM SIGPLAN Programming Languages Software Award \\"for his design and development of the Low Level Virtual Machine\\", noting that Professor Adve has stated: \\"Lattner’s talent as a compiler architect, together with his programming skills, technical vision, and leadership ability were crucial to the success of LLVM.\\" In April 2013, the ACM awarded Lattner its Software System Award,ACM (2013).

Swift  Swift is an open source programming language with first-class functions for iOS and macOS development, created by Apple and introduced at Apple's developer conference Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2014. Swift is designed to coexist with Objective-C, the object-oriented programming language formerly preferred by Apple, and to be more resilient against erroneous code. It is built with the LLVM compiler included in Xcode 6. Lattner began developing Swift in 2010, with the eventual collaboration of many other programmers. On June 2, 2014, the WWDC app became the first publicly released app that used Swift. Lattner announced that the Project Lead role had been transferred to Ted Kremenek, and that Lattner would leave Apple in January 2017.

Born in Kensington in 1887, the son of White Russian immigrants, de Relwyskow took up wrestling as a means of keeping fit while a student in London training as an artist and designer. By 1907 he had won thirty-five open competitions in Great Britain and won the English amateur championships at lightweight and middleweight in 1907 and 1908. Because of his success he selected to represent Great Britain in the 1908 Olympics held in London.George de Relwyskow on the Wrestling Heritage website On the outbreak of the First World War de Relwyskow returned to Britain from South America where he was on a wrestling tour to enlist in the Army. He served as a gymnastic and bayonet-fighting trainer, and served for a period with the Australian infantry. In France he trained soldiers in the use of unarmed combat. In October 1918 de Relwyskow was based at Aldershot as a Royal Army Physical Training Corps instructor in the Army system of wrestling, a system he created. In 1924 he was appointed trainer to the British Olympic Games team in the 1924 Olympics held in Paris. He enlisted again at the start of World War II and served as an instructor in Unarmed Combat and Silent Killing with the Special Operations Executive (SOE). After serving for a period as an Instructor to the SOE School in Canada - the Special Training School (STS) 103 (which was also known as \\"Camp X\\"), de Relwyskow returned to Britain before being sent to the Far East. Relwyskow died at his Leeds home in 1942. He left a wife, Clara, and sons Douglas and George. Douglas was a professional wrestling referee, whose own son, also called Douglas (grandson of the original George), became a regular face on televised professional wrestling in the UK under the name Barry Douglas. The younger George de Relwyskow pursued a career in professional wrestling cut short by an injury in World War II.

Wall of New Jersey on the floor of the Senate Military career He was appointed to the rank Lieutenant Colonel in the New Jersey militia on 14 June 1776 by an ordinance of the Provincial Congress of New Jersey. On 1 August he was promoted to Colonel and was placed in command of a regiment in Brigadier General Nathaniel Heard's brigade of New Jersey troops at New York. The regiment, totaled about 235 men and consisted of three companies from Somerset County and five from Hunterdon County.Johnston, Henry Phelps; The Campaign of 1776 Around New York and Brooklyn, p112, 130 According to the 1836 memorial of Senator Garret D. Wall of New Jersey, he died \\"near the side, and under the eye of his immediate commander General Sullivan.\\" Heard's brigade was initially under the command of Nathanael Greene at Long Island, however when Greene fell ill just prior to the battle the command devolved upon Gen John Sullivan and later to Gen Israel Putnam. Johnston and his unit formed part of the guard at the Flatbush Road during the night prior to the battle.Johnston, Henry Phelps; The Campaign of 1776 Around New York and Brooklyn, p196 After the battle commenced Sullivan commanded an element of about 800 soldiers that moved toward the center of the American advanced position to support units at the passes, including Johnston's. They were overwhelmed and dispersed in the ensuing fight and General Sullivan and the mortally wounded Colonel Johnston were captured.Johnston, Henry Phelps; The Campaign of 1776 Around New York and Brooklyn, p176, 205 Senator Wall likely inferred that Sullivan was his commander based upon a newspaper account of the time preserved by the family as a keepsake that read: > We hear that, in the late action on Long Island, Colonel Philip Johnston of > New Jersey behaved with remarkable intrepidity and fortitude. By the well- > directed fire from his battalion, the enemy was several times repulsed, and > lanes were made through them, until he received a ball in his breast, which > put an end to the life of as brave an officer as ever commanded a battalion. > General Sullivan, who was close to him when he fell, says that no man could > behave with more firmness during the whole action. As he sacrificed his life > in defence of the invaded rights of his country, his memory must be dear to > every American who is not insensible to the sufferings of his injured > country, and as long as the same uncorrupted spirit of liberty which led him > to the field shall continue to actuate the sons of freemen in America. The day of the battle, August 27 was his thirty-fifth birthday. Children At the time of the 1836 memorial to Congress, three of Colonel Johnston's daughters remained alive. One of them, Maria Scudder, had married Joseph Scudder, the son of Colonel Nathaniel Scudder, the only member of the Continental Congress to die in battle during the American Revolutionary War. Philip Johnston was the first colonel of the New Jersey militia to die in battle in the Revolutionary War and Nathaniel Scudder was the last colonel of the New Jersey militia to die in battle in the Revolutionary War.

L. Lehmus and subsequently proved by Jakob Steiner. It states: : Every triangle with two angle bisectors of equal lengths is isosceles. The theorem was first mentioned in 1840 in a letter by C. L. Lehmus to C. Sturm, in which he asked for a purely geometric proof. C. Sturm passed the request on to other mathematicians and Jakob Steiner was among the first to provide a solution. The theorem became a rather popular topic in elementary geometry ever since with a somewhat regular publication of articles on it.Coxeter, H. S. M. and Greitzer, S. L. \\"The Steiner–Lehmus Theorem.\\" §1.5 in Geometry Revisited. Washington, DC: Math. Assoc. Amer., pp. 14–16, 1967.Diane and Roy Dowling: The Lasting Legacy of Ludolph Lehmus. Manitoba Math Links – Volume II – Issue 3, Spring 2002Barbara, Roy, \\"Steiner–Lehmus, revisited\\", Mathematical Gazette 91, November 2007, pp. 528–529 (JSTOR) Direct proofs The Steiner–Lehmus theorem can be proved using elementary geometry by proving the contrapositive statement. There is some controversy over whether a \\"direct\\" proof is possible; allegedly \\"direct\\" proofs have been published, but not everyone agrees that these proofs are \\"direct.\\" For example, there exist simple algebraic expressions for angle bisectors in terms of the sides of the triangle. Equating two of these expressions and algebraically manipulating the equation results in a product of two factors which equal 0, but only one of them (a − b) can equal 0 and the other must be positive. Thus a = b. But this may not be considered direct as one must first argue about why the other factor cannot be 0\\\\. John ConwayAlleged impossibility of \\"direct\\" proof of Steiner–Lehmus theorem has argued that there can be no \\"equality-chasing\\" proof because the theorem (stated algebraically) does not hold over an arbitrary field, or even when negative real numbers are allowed as parameters. A precise definition of a \\"direct proof\\" inside both classical and intuitionistic logic has been provided by Victor Pambuccian., who proved, without presenting the direct proofs, that direct proofs must exist in both the classical logic and the intuitionistic logic setting.

In 1890 he earned his medical doctorate from the University of Bonn, and afterwards was an assistant to pathologist Eugen Bostroem (1850–1928) in Giessen and to internist Otto Michael Ludwig Leichtenstern (1845–1900) in Cologne. In 1899 he was habilitated for surgery at Leipzig, and in 1907 he became a professor of surgery at Basel. In 1910 he attained the chair of surgery at the University of Heidelberg. In May 1918, while performing emergency surgery on a French P.O.W. who had a swollen larynx associated with diphtheria, Wilms became infected with the disease, and died within a few days at the age of 50. Reportedly, he was successful in saving the life of the French soldier. After his death, his position at Heidelberg was filled by surgeon Eugen Enderlen (1863–1940). Max Wilms is remembered for his work in the field of nephrology, and his pathological studies concerning the development of tumor cells. In his research of renal tumors, he proposed that tumor cells originate during the development of the embryo.

The relationship has developed since the early 16th century, when Spanish empire colonizers created the Province of Santa Marta (now Colombia) and the Province of New Andalucia (now Venezuela). The countries share a history for achieving their independence under Simón Bolívar and becoming one nation—the Gran Colombia—which dissolved in the 19th century. Following then, the overall relationship between the two countries has vacillated between cooperation and bilateral struggle. History These neighboring countries share a similar history as parts of the Spanish Empire. The border dispute long predates the foundations of the modern nations, and goes back to the difficulties experienced in shaping a boundary between the colonies of Santa Marta (now Santa Marta, Colombia) and New Andalusia (now part of Venezuela). During the colonial era the Guajira Peninsula—then inhabited by the Wayuu indigenous group—resisted the invasion of the Spaniards coming from Santa Marta and New Andalusia, a situation which prevented the colonies from delimiting their territories in the area. The Wayuu tribes were finally subdued by the end of the colonial period with the independence of both colonies in the early 19th century. The new independent began formal negotiations to divide the Guajira peninsula in a longitudinal manner. Negotiations failed and the parties asked Spain to intervene. In 1891 the Spanish crown issued a judgment but failed once again to delimit the border because of confusing geographical locations. Since the 20th century the relationship has evolved with ups and downs mostly regarding the Colombia–Venezuela maritime territory dispute over the Gulf of Venezuela. The lowest point in the relationship occurred on August 19, 1987, after the Colombian corvette ARC Caldas (FM-52) trespassed into disputed waters and then President of Venezuela, Jaime Lusinchi, ordered the Venezuelan Air Force to the area. The standoff was resolved through diplomatic channels but the dispute remained. Published in Power in Latin America (Issue 129/2004) The Colombian armed conflict between the Colombian government and guerrilla groups has also provoked impasses between the two countries. Military illegal incursions by the two countries' military forces into each other's territory have been frequent since the conflict in Colombia escalated in the 1980s, which subsequently triggered forced displacements in Colombia and into Venezuela. Illegally armed groups also trespassed into Venezuela. Contraband flows from one territory to another depending on supply and demand along the shared porous border of . Illegal products range from gasoline, drugs and weapons to stolen cars. Since 2002, the relationship between Venezuela and Colombia has fluctuated due to ideological differences between both governments.  Chronology  1922–1941 ;End of land border dispute In 1939 the Venezuelan government issued a decree imposing a maritime border line from the village of Castilletes in Guajira Peninsula to Paraguaná Peninsula which result in most of the Gulf belonging to Venezuela. The Colombian government reacted to this in the late 1940s asking the Venezuelan government to rectify and draw a middle line in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. In 1941 once again bilateral negotiations resumed settling the territorial border, successfully agreeing upon the Venezuela-Colombia Boundary Treaty of 1941, but setting off a new round of differences regarding the maritime territory. 1941–1987 On April 5, 1941, Colombia and Venezuela created the Tratado de delimitación terrestre y de navegación de ríos comunes (Common rivers navigation and terrestrial delimitation treaty). =Secession of Los Monjes Archipelago= Monjes del Sur (South Island), from the south On November 22, 1952, the Colombian government renounced its claims over the Los Monjes Archipelago. The treaty was signed by chancellors Esteban Gil Borges, from Venezuela and Luis López de Mesa, from Colombia, with the presence of the ambassadors Santiago Rodríguez and Alberto Pumarejo in the city of Cúcuta. 1987–1991 =The Caldas frigate crisis= The ARC Caldas (FM-52) is an Almirante Padilla class frigate Tensions escalated on August 11, 1987, as a result of the Caldas frigate incident. The Colombian guided missile frigate Caldas refuse to leave the disputed waters claiming they belonged to Colombia. The Venezuelan government reacted by sending a fleet of F-16 fighter jets and almost engaging in combat. Once again, on June 20, 1989, Colombia and Venezuela created the Comisión de vecindad Colombo-Venezolana (Colombo-Venezuelan neighborhood Commission). Colombia and Venezuela then signed the Accord of Open Skies on May 18, 1991. Both countries also create the Comisión mixta para el control del tráfico de estupefacientes (Mixed Commission for the Control of Illegal Drugs Traffic).  Combifron: 1994–1998  In 1994 Colombian and Venezuelan government created the Comisión binacional de Fronteras (Combifron) or \\"Binational Commission of Frontiers\\" which intended to exchange military intelligence between the two countries. =1995 – ELN incursion in Venezuela= On February 25, 1995, the Colombian guerrilla group National Liberation Army (ELN) attacked a fluvial military post, penetrating on the Venezuelan side and killing 8 Venezuelans and injuring 12 Marines.  Chávez presidency: 1998–2012  On April 30, 1998, The ELN guerrilla assaulted the Colombian border town of Ragonvalia. After the attacks the guerrillas crossed the border into Venezuela. Venezuelan president Rafael Caldera authorized the Colombian Army to enter Venezuela and fight the guerrillas. =2000 – Venezuelan military incursion in Colombia= On March 21, 2000, Four Venezuelan helicopters and two airplanes entered Colombian airspace and bombarded an area in the jungle region of Catatumbo, in the Department of North Santander. On April 23, Colombian and Venezuelan governments signed an accord of understanding the issues of population displacement. This in regards to the Colombian nationals displaced by the conflict and crossing into Venezuela. Between May and June 2000, Venezuelan truckers blocked the border crossing between the two countries protesting the lack of guarantees for their safety in Colombia due to the constant attacks perpetrated by the Colombian guerrillas. =2001 – Ballestas case= In February 2001 the ELN commander José María Ballestas, accused in Colombia of hijacking an Avianca airplane, was captured in Venezuela but later released causing diplomatic tensions between the governments of Hugo Chávez and Andrés Pastrana. Ballestas was later recaptured by Venezuelan authorities and in December 2001, was extradited from Venezuela to Colombia. =2002 – Coup d'état against Hugo Chávez= After the 2002 Venezuelan coup d'état attempt toppled Chávez for two days, Pedro Carmona fled house arrest and asked for political asylum at the Colombian ambassador's residence in Caracas, which he was later granted. The government of Hugo Chávez criticized the decision but granted Carmona safe passage out of Venezuela. =Rodrigo Granda= In 2004 the relationship became strained again in the Rodrigo Granda affair, with the kidnapping in Caracas of Colombian-Venezuelan naturalized guerrilla member Rodrigo Granda. Granda was transported by his captors to the border city of Cúcuta in Colombia and taken into custody by the Colombian National Police on rebellion charges. =2007 – Post-humanitarian exchange negotiation= Hugo Chávez with the guarantors of \\"Operation Emmanuel\\" In late 2007 Colombian President Álvaro Uribe, through his appointed negotiator Piedad Córdoba, contacted Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez to facilitate the humanitarian exchange negotiations of prisoners for hostages between the government of Colombia and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. During a private meeting at the 2007 Ibero-American Summit, Uribe told Chávez not to contact Colombian military commanders. Two weeks after the summit, Chávez tried to communicate with the General of the Colombian National Army Mario Montoya Uribe. The issue was reported to Uribe who publicly announced the interruption of Chávez and Córdoba as facilitators. =Operation Emmanuel= While relations between the two governments continued to be strained, on December 27, 2007, Chávez publicly said that he had a plan set up to rescue the three hostages promised to Chávez by the FARC guerrilla in compensation. This was after Colombian president Uribe decided to end the mediation by Chávez and Piedad Córdoba. Operation Emmanuel used Venezuelan aircraft in coordination with the International Red Cross to fly into Colombia and rescue the hostages from the FARC. =Operation Road to Freedom= In February 2008, the Venezuelan government launched a new operation to liberate four more hostages held by the FARC: Luis Eladio Perez, Orlando Beltran, Gloria Polanco and Jorge Eduardo Géchem all of them former senators kidnapped by the FARC in order to pressure the Colombian government. =2008 Andean diplomatic crisis= On March 1, 2008, the Colombian military launched an attack against FARC in the border area between Colombia and Ecuador, which ended with the death of some 19 guerrillas, including the group's second-in-command Raúl Reyes. The attack targeted a guerrilla camp some 1.8 km inside Ecuadorean territory. Colombian president Álvaro Uribe called Ecuadorean president Rafael Correa, arguing that Colombian forces had crossed the border during combat in pursuit of the guerrillas. Correa said he would investigate the events and later accused the Colombian government of lying, recalling his ambassador in Bogotá. The Colombian government subsequently apologized for its actions. Reacting to the event, Hugo Chávez stated that if Colombia launched a similar operation within Venezuelan borders he would consider it a casus belli and verbally attacked the Colombian president. Chavez ordered ten national guard battalions to the Colombia–Venezuela border and closed its embassy in Bogotá. Chavez also offered his support to Ecuadorean president Correa. On March 9, 2008, the Venezuelan government announced that it was re-establishing normal diplomatic ties with Colombia. Chavez asked Latin American nations and the European Union to remove FARC from their lists of terrorist organizations, which they roundly refused to do. FARC was added to the European Union's list in 2002 after the kidnapping of Íngrid Betancourt, one of the 700 hostages held by FARC as of 2008.\\"EU to keep Farc on 'terror list': The European Union has insisted it will not remove Colombia's Farc rebels from its \\"terror list\\", despite recent calls by Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez\\" In June 2008 Chávez worked to get FARC rebels in Colombia to release hostages and end their war against the Colombian government. Later, he withdrew his support for FARC.\\"Chavez ends support of Farc rebels: Hugo Chávez said he was ending his support for Colombia's Marxist guerillas, robbing them of their most public and powerful ally.\\" article by Jeremy McDermott in Medellín published: BST 2008 in Telegraph.co.uk Los Maniceros massacre  In late July, the Colombian government claimed that AT4 anti-tank rockets manufactured by Saab Bofors Dynamics of Sweden, which were later purchased by Venezuela were being used by the FARC. In response, President Chavez ordered most staff members of the embassy in Colombia to return to Venezuela, including the ambassador. Only the \\"lowest functionaries\\" were left to staff the embassy. Venezuela halted imports of Colombian cars and banned a Colombian energy firm from Venezuela's oil-rich Orinoco region. The Venezuelan ambassador was later sent back to Bogotá. President Chávez stated that the five anti-tank rockets were stolen when the Colombian guerrilla group FARC attacked a military post in 1995 and took the armaments. However, Colombian newsweekly Revista Semana reported that the attack on the Venezuelan outpost in 1995 was actually carried out by the National Liberation Army (ELN) instead of FARC and that Chávez could not explain how the weapons would have passed from one guerrilla group to another. In addition, former Venezuelan military personnel denied that the rockets in question were ever present in the outpost. =2010 – FARC files = The 2010 Colombia-Venezuela diplomatic crisis was a diplomatic stand-off between Colombia and Venezuela over allegations in July 2010 by outgoing President Álvaro Uribe that the Venezuelan government was actively permitting the Colombian FARC and ELN guerillas to seek safe haven in its territory. Uribe presented evidence to the Organization of American States (OAS) allegedly drawn from laptops acquired in Colombia's 2008 raid on a FARC camp in Ecuador, which had sparked the 2008 Andean diplomatic crisis. In response to the allegations Venezuela broke off diplomatic relations, and there was speculation of a possible war. The crisis was resolved after Juan Manuel Santos was inaugurated as the new President of Colombia on 7 August 2010, and the intervention of UNASUR bringing together Santos and Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez. Chávez told the guerillas that there could be no military solution to the conflict, and Santos agreed to turn over the disputed laptops to the Ecuadorean government. Colombia and Venezuela agreed to re-establish diplomatic relations.  Maduro presidency: 2013–present  = 2013 – Henrique Capriles = In 2013, a new diplomatic crisis erupted because of discomfort expressed by the Venezuelan government of Nicolás Maduro for the reception of opposition leader Henrique Capriles by his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos at the Presidential Palace in May 2013. Capriles was on a regional tour denouncing the alleged fraud in the presidential elections of 2013 in which the \\"successor\\" of Hugo Chávez had won by a narrow margin. For his part, the President of the National Assembly of Venezuela, Diosdado Cabello relate this meeting with an \\"alleged plot\\" between opposition sectors in both Venezuela and Colombia to try a coup d'état to depose Maduro. Bilateral relations were normalized in July 2013 with a presidential meeting held in the Venezuelan city of Puerto Ayacucho. = 2015 – Venezuela–Colombia Border Dispute = In mid-late August 2015 a new crisis develops after the government of Nicolas Maduro closed the passage through the Simón Bolívar International Bridge, border crossing linking Colombia and Venezuela in Táchira state and deported Colombian citizens who were in this state. According to the Venezuelan government, Colombian militias were allegedly involved in an attack on Venezuelan soldiers in the area, as well as illegal activities such as smuggling gasoline and other basic goods. Venezuelan authorities warned that the closure could be extended to all of the bilateral border with Colombia. The crisis resulted in tens of thousands of Colombians living in Venezuela being displaced. In mid-September 2015, Venezuela flew two fighter jets along the Venezuela/Colombian Border. = 2018 – Military concerns, Duque presidency = Following revelations on 5 July 2018 that United States president Donald Trump made comments regarding options involving military intervention in Venezuela, options which the Colombian government distanced itself from, former Venezuelan military officer and high-level official Pedro Carreño stated that if the United States were to attack Venezuela, the Venezuelan military would immediately fire on targets in Colombia. Carreño stated that Venezuelan Sukhoi fighter jets would destroy the seven bridges crossing the Magdalena River in order to virtually divide Colombia in two. Days later on 12 July 2018, the Venezuelan military placed missiles and anti-air equipment on its border with Colombia in Táchira, placing Colombian forces on alert. The Lima Group expressed \\"deep concern\\" about Venezuela's militarized stance towards Colombia, further criticizing Venezuela's human rights record. A month later, following the 2018 Caracas bombing on 4 August 2018, the Venezuelan government blamed Colombia as the mastermind behind the incident, stating that Venezuela will \\"hold the Colombian government responsible for any new aggression\\". Upon assuming the Colombian Presidency on August 7, 2018, Iván Duque announced that he would not have an ambassador in Venezuela because he does not recognise the Maduro administration. He did maintain that consular relations would continue, as a necessity to discuss border disputes. On 12 August 2018, former Foreign Minister of Venezuela, Roy Chaderton, stated that Venezuelans are \\"more civilized\\" than Colombians and referred to himself as \\"part of the Pedro Carreño command\\" of the Bolivarian government, believing that Venezuelan troops must conquer Colombia and \\"reach the Pacific, because at last and finally we liberate the countries whose coasts are bathed by the Pacific Ocean...I believe that we...have military superiority\\". On 19 December 2018, Carlos Manuel Pino García, an advisor to the Venezuelan embassy in Colombia, was arrested outside a restaurant in Bogotá, taken north to Cúcuta on the Venezuelan border, and deported to Venezuela before sunrise the next morning. He had lived in Colombia ever since authorities captured him along with three other Venezuelans on 26 May 1999 at a FARC encampment in the wilderness in Colombia's Vichada department near the Venezuelan border. The men arrested in 1999 were suspected of collaborating with the FARC, but Venezuela did not cooperate with Colombia's investigation, so Colombia released them. Colombia's immigration agency justified Pino's 2018 deportation by pointing to legislation against activities by foreigners that \\"threaten national security, public order, public health, or public safety\\" and claiming that Pino did not have diplomatic immunity. Pino will not be allowed to return to Colombia for ten years, after which he must apply for a visa to enter Colombia. He is married to Colombian former senator Gloria Inés Flórez, with whom he has a Colombian son. Flórez had worked for Gustavo Petro from 2014 to 2015 while he was mayor of Bogotá, and she continued to support Petro, who subsequently lost the 2018 presidential election to Iván Duque. 23 February 2019 relationship were broken. = 2019 – Return of FARC-EP, Feud with Duque = Venezuela cited Colombian President Ivan Duque’s policies as the reason behind revival of the armed conflict in the country. Enmity between both the leaders sparked after Duque accused Maduro of sheltering leftist fighters in Venezuela. Invoking the Rio Treaty In a tough stance against Venezuela, members of the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance decided to invoke the Rio Treaty, which will follow joint actions, including economic sanctions to the use of military force and ending transport and communications links. 74th United Nations General Assembly At the 74th United Nations General Assembly General Debate, President Iván Duque Márquez presented a 128-page dossier revealing Venezuela’s support of a plot for a cross-border penetration by assisting a criminal network, which is against Colombia. On September 30, 2019, Colombia's defense minister Guillermo Botero summoned the media to divulge evidence proving that Venezuela is sheltering and coordinating with the National Liberation Army (ELN) to plan attacks against Colombia. Breaking Relations and Closing Embassies On February 23, 2019, Maduro cut off diplomatic ties with Colombia. All embassies and consulates were closed and the diplomats were evacuated. This situation will persist for an indefinite amount of time.

Cuban immigration has greatly influenced modern Miami, creating what is known as \\"Cuban Miami.\\" However, Miami reflects global trends as well, such as the growing trends of multiculturalism and multiracialism; this reflects the way in which international politics shape local communities. About 500,000 Cubans, most of them business people and professionals, arrived in Miami during a 15-year period after the Cuban Revolution. Some figures in Fulgencio Batista's administration were among those who arrived in Miami. The Miami Cubans received assimilation aid from the federal government. The Cubans established businesses in Miami. The Cubans arriving after 1980 did so primarily because of economic reasons. Essentially, the coexistence of growth and internationalization within Miami has perpetuated an ethnically driven social polarization. The growing number of Cubans in Miami have remained loyal to their cultural norms, mores, customs, language, and religious affiliations. The transnational force of immigration defines Miami as a growing metropolis, and the 20th century Cuban influx has greatly affected Miami's growth. As of 2012, there were 1.2 million people of Cuban heritage in Greater Miami. As of that year, about 400,000 had arrived after 1980.\\"Cuban-Americans The Miami mirror.\\" The Economist. March 24, 2012. Retrieved on February 8, 2014.  History  Chart showing history of Cuban refugees arriving in Florida.  Early migration (1800s - 1958)  Due to Miami's geographic proximity to Cuba it served as an easy location to migrate to for Cubans who were dissatisfied with poverty, or the various military dictatorships in Cuba. Many affluent Cuban families also sent their children to school in the United States, usually in Miami. Various Cuban political leaders used Miami as a base of operations to organize against the Fulgencio Batista regime. By 1958 only about 10,000 Cubans lived in Miami, while various affluent Cubans would often visit Miami, even just for the day. The tourist industry in Miami heavily catered to Cuban visitors and tried to offer as many services in Spanish as possible.  First Cuban exiles (1959 - 1973)  After the Cuban Revolution of 1959 various Cubans began to leave the country. Cubans settled in various places around the United States but many settled in Miami due to its proximity to Cuba and Cuban culture already in the city. Many would live in the neighborhoods of Little Havana or Hialeah, Florida in Miami due to their cheap housing, new jobs, and sometimes their access to Spanish speaking businesses. As Cubans became more settled in Miami more businesses and media outlets began catering to Spanish speaking audiences. Many non-Hispanic locals began moving out of Miami in a white flight. Cuban immigration greatly affected Miami's future demographics. For example, the net immigration of African Americans into Miami was reduced during the 1960s in comparison to previous years. This was the result of Cuban immigrants competing for jobs that had often been afforded to African Americans living in Miami. This reduction of immigration of non-Hispanics displayed the growing presence of Cubans in Miami. Miami \\"posts a low emigration rate-43.6 per 1,000. This, of course, stems from the huge Cuban presence in Dade County and is testimony to the holding power of the Cuban enclave in Miami\\".  Later exiles and migrants (1974 - )  By 1980 many Cubans arrived in the United States due to the Mariel boatlift. But other Cubans already in the United States began to enter south Florida. Miami posted an in-migration of 35,776 Cubans from elsewhere in the United States between 1985 and 1990 and an emigration of 21,231, mostly to elsewhere in Florida. Flows to and from Miami account for 52 percent of all interregional migration in the Cuban settlement system\\". Cubans continued to come to the United States and specifically Miami, especially during the 1994 Cuban rafter crisis and beyond. As Cubans continued to immigrate and become more settled in American society, many Cuban owned businesses began to prosper in the Miami area.  Culture  Bay of Pigs Memorial in Little Havana, Miami  Language  With the emerging importance of ethnicity and the increased effects of segregation, Cubans within Miami attempted to reassert the Spanish language. In Miami, the Spanish language was spoken to a larger extent than in other cities with large Hispanic populations; also it was spoken in more diverse settings in Miami than any other city. The 1970 census revealed that Spanish speakers made up 24 percent of Miami's population.Winsberg, Morton D. (1979), \\"Housing Segregation of a Predominantly Middle Class Population: Residential Patterns Developed by the Cuban Immigration into Miami, 1950-74\\", American Journal of Economics and Sociology, 38. 403-418 The Spanish language was becoming a norm in Miami as it was more extensively spoken by Miami's Cuban elite. Language became increasingly important in 20th-century Miami as a result of the Cuban influx and this had impacts on other non-Latin communities. Non-Hispanic communities began to oppose the rise of the Spanish language as a growing force within Miami. This can be seen in the anti- bilingualism/English Only movement. This movement came about in 1980, after a long period of vast Cuban immigration and social reform. Language was becoming a pressing issue as \\"Miami had the first bilingual public school program in the modern period (1963) and the first English Only referendum (1980)\\".Castro, Max, J. (1992), \\"The Politics of Language in Miami\\", Miami Now: Immigration, Ethnicity, and Social Change (University Press of Florida): 109-133 In fact the debates of English as Dade County's official language led to violent and dangerous riots in the 1980s.Croucher, Sheila, L. (1999), \\"Ethnic Inventions: Constructing and Deconstructing Miami's Culture Clash\\", The Pacific Historical Review, 68: 233-251 Cubans felt that by preserving their language, they were preserving a fundamental component of their culture. In the 2000 census, 59.2% of people in Miami-Dade County said that they spoke Spanish at home.2000 US Census Profile of selected social characteristics for Miami-Dade County  Media  Although the media in Miami allows a certain amount of cultural labeling to flourish within the community, it also portrays the growing importance and domination of Cuban immigrants. For example, the Miami Herald's June 14, 1996 headline reads \\"Vanishing Spanish\\". The headline refers to, and deplores the fact that, only a small percentage of recent high school graduates were fluent in Spanish; whereas the majority of second-generation Cuban immigrants spoke broken Spanish, and only spoke it in the home. \\"This was described as an alarming trend since it erodes Miami's advantage as a bilingual community and diminishes its economic competitiveness\\". During the 20th century, many Spanish-language newspapers were founded in Miami. \\"The Miami Herald created a Spanish-language insert, el Nuevo Herald, in 1976\\".Huntz, Maura E. (1996), \\"Spanish-Language Newspapers in the United States\\", Geographical Review, 86: 446-456 This addition received a vast amount of support and \\"by 1981 circulation reached 83,000 on weekdays and 94,000 for weekend editions. el Nuevo Herald is now published as an independent newspaper and reports a weekday circulation of about 100,000. It too is accessible on the World Wide Web (http://www.elnuevoherald.com). As the Hispanic population has grown and achieved considerable economic success, it has also moved beyond Miami's city limits: Spanish-language newspapers are now published in adjacent Hialeah and Fort Lauderdale. This expansion can be seen at a statewide level as well, for Tampa, Orlando, and Immokalee each have Spanish-language newspapers\\". Essentially, through the founding and growth of distinctly Hispanic newspapers, Cuban immigrants established a distinctly Latin American media. Politics Historically the Miami Cuban community has strongly opposed Fidel Castro and has blocked normalization in Cuba-United States relations. The Cubans arriving after 1980 have closer ties to those remaining in Cuba. They tend to take charter flights to and from Miami to Cuba. Parks and recreation As common meeting places, several parks in the greater Miami area reflect the influence of Cuban migration to the community and nod to Cuban culture. Starting in the early 1970s, community leader and urban planner Jesus Permuy spearheaded the effort to designate a park for the Cuban exile community.Ed Taylor, \\"Miami OKs 'Latin' Park Site\\", The Miami News (April 27, 1973), p. 16A. The sometimes controversial proposed park was known for much of the almost ten-year effort simply as the \\"Latin Park,\\" and faced some pushback from non-Cuban residents. The park was unanimously approved by the Miami City Commission, however, and finally opened in 1980 as José Martí Park in honor of Cuban icon José Martí. Another noteworthy park named after a popular Cuban figure is Máximo Gómez Park, named after Máximo Gómez. Additionally, other parks feature monuments and landmarks in honor of Cuban figures, such as the \\"MINOSO\\" sculpture in Miami Lakes' Optimist Park by Cuban artist Rafael Consuegra that was erected in honor of Cuban baseball player Minnie Minoso.

New York: Oxford University Press, 1989, accessed 7 November 2013 According to Tom Turnipseed, the first executive director of the South Carolina Independent School Association, James H Hammond's \\"name was chosen because his grandson contributed significant money to the school's founding, and Confederate big- wigs were favored as names for white-flight private schools started as part of the backlash to impending racial desegregation of public schools.\\" The school's enrollment surged in 1968 when details of the public school desegregation busing plan were released. One parent told that Los Angeles Times that she enrolled her children at Hammond Academy because \\"integration had turned the public schools upside down\\" In 1972, Hammond Academy's tax exemption was revoked by the IRS when it refused to document that it had a racially nondiscriminatory admissions policy. In 1976, a school administrator told John Egerton the school did not want the tax exemption because the school was \\"better off without negroes\\". The administrator further opined that \\"segregation is coming back to this country\\" because it is a \\"more natural condition.\\" The school initially eschewed extracurricular activities in to focus on basic education In the 1980s, under headmaster Nick Hagerman, Hammond Academy moved away from its segregationist roots.

Tumpeng is one of the most famous Javanese dishes. Javanese cuisine is the cuisine of Javanese people, a major ethnic group in Indonesia, more precisely the province of Central Java, Yogyakarta and East Java. Though the cuisine of Sumatra is known for its spiciness with notable Indian and Arabic influences, Javanese cuisine is more indigenously developed and noted for its simplicity. Some of Javanese dishes demonstrate foreign influences, most notably Chinese. Some Indonesians perceive Javanese cuisine as sweeter compared to other Indonesian dishes, because of the liberal use of gula jawa (palm sugar) or kecap manis (sweet soy sauce). Javanese food is categorized into Central and East Javanese food; both simple and non-spicy food, though Central Javanese food tends to be sweeter. In a wider sense, Javanese cuisine might also refer to the cuisine of the whole people of Java Island, Indonesia; which also include Sundanese in West Java and Banten, Betawi in Jakarta and Madurese on Madura Island off East Java. These ethnic groups have their own distinctive cuisines. Nasi kuning with urap, fried beef, anchovy and peanuts, potato and shrimp in sambal. Javanese cuisine is largely divided into three major groups: * Central Javanese cuisine * East Javanese cuisine * Common Javanese dishes There are similarities in these cuisines but the main differences lie in the flavors. Central Javanese cuisine tend to be sweeter and less spicy, while East Javanese cuisine uses less sugar and more chili, possibly influenced by Madurese cuisine or Indian cuisine.  History  Selamatan traditional Javanese ceremony usually involved a communal feast of eating together. Javanese cooking tradition has a long history, derived from Javanese indigenous elements, and along its history, was enrichen by foreign influences — including Indian, Chinese and European influences. Ancient dishes and recipes was mentioned in numbers of Javanese prasasti (inscription) and modern historians has been succeed on deciphered some of them. The inscriptions from Medang Mataram era circa 8th to 10th century mentioned several ancient dishes, among others are Hadangan Harang (water buffalo minced meat satay, similar with today Balinese sate lilit), Hadangan Madura (water buffalo meat with sweet palm sugar), and Dundu Puyengan (eel seasoned with lemon basil). Ancient beverages include Nalaka Rasa (sugarcane juice), Jati Wangi (jasmine beverage), and Kinca (tamarind juice). Also various Kuluban (boiled vegetables served in spices, similar with today urab) and Phalamula (boiled yams and tubers served with liquid palm sugar). In Javanese culture, food is an integral part of traditional ceremonies. For example selamatan ceremony often performed as a symbol of gratitude, are usually involving a communal feast where participants, guests and attendances are invited to eat together. Food are usually prepared, cooked and served together. It also symbolyzes gotong- royong (working together), guyub (harmonious communal spirit), abundance and gratitute.  Ingredients  Fresh produce including vegetables on sale in pasar pagi (morning wet market) in Surabaya. Rice is an important food crop in Java, dating back to ancient times. The Javanese are known to revere Dewi Sri as the Rice Goddess. Steamed rice is the common staple food, and is served at every meal. Tumpeng, a cone-shaped yellow rice is essential in slametan, Javanese traditional ceremonies. Rice can be processed into lontong or ketupat, or cooked in coconut milk as nasi liwet or colored with turmeric as nasi kuning (yellow rice). Other sources of carbohydrate such as gaplek (dried cassava) is sometimes mixed into rice or replaces rice. Gaplek is usually consumed by poor commoners during hard times when rice is scarce. Tubers such as yam, taro, and sweet potato are consumed as snacks in between meals. Bread and grains other than rice are uncommon, although noodles and potatoes are often served as accompaniments to rice. Potatoes are often boiled then mashed, shaped into discs, spiced, coated in beaten eggs and fried into perkedel. Wheat noodles, bihun (rice vermicelli), and kwetiau are influences of Chinese cuisine. The Javanese adopted these ingredients and made them their own by adding kecap manis (sweet soy sauce) and local spices to create bakmi Jawa, bakmi rebus, and bihun goreng. Vegetables feature heavily in Javanese cuisine, notably in vegetable-heavy dishes such as pecel, lotek, and urap. nasi gudeg, which consist of (from top clockwise): krechek (spiced buffalo skin cracker), ayam goreng (fried chicken), opor telur pindang (spiced egg in coconut milk), and gudeg (unripe jackfruit cooked in coconut milk). Coconut milk, peanut sauce, gula jawa (palm sugar), asem jawa (tamarind), petis, terasi (shrimp paste), shallot, garlic, turmeric, galangal, ginger, and chili sambal are common ingredients and spices that can be found in Javanese cuisine. Freshwater fishes such as carp, tilapia, gourami and catfish are popular, while seafood such as tuna, red snapper, wahoo, ray, anchovy, shrimp, squid, and various salted fish are popular in coastal Javanese cities. Chicken, goat meat, mutton and beef are popular meats in Javanese cuisine. Next to common farmed chicken, the ayam kampung or free-range chicken, is popular and valued for its leaner, more natural flavors. Almost 90% of Javanese are Muslim, and consequently, much of Javanese cuisine omits pork. However, in small enclaves of Catholic Javanese population around Muntilan, Magelang, Yogyakarta, and Klaten, pork might be consumed. Few ethnic groups in Indonesia use pork and other sources of protein considered haram under Muslim dietary laws in their cuisine, most prominently Balinese cuisine, Indonesian Chinese cuisine, Batak cuisine, and Manado cuisine.  Influences  Sambal tempeh penyet kemangi. Compared to the spicy and curry-like cuisine of Sumatra that is heavily influenced by Indian cuisine, Javanese cuisine is most notably influenced by Chinese and European with some local touch. Javanese cuisine in different areas show different foreign influences. For example, Chinese influences is prevalent in Semarang, Yogyakarta, and Cirebon; Indian and Arabic influences in Surabaya, Lamongan, and Gresik; and European influences in Solo and Malang. Javanese cuisine may also have contributed and influenced foreign cuisines. Javanese botok, for example, has influenced the South African bobotie dish and in the Netherlands, Javanese lumpia has influenced on Dutch cuisine. Because of the dispersion of Javanese people outside of Indonesia, the Javanese cuisine has influenced the cuisine of Johor in Malaysia, Singapore and the cuisine of Suriname. The influence of Javanese cuisine has contributed significantly to the food of Johor. Javanese-Malaysian dishes such as nasi ambeng, soto ayam, pecel, tempe, and sambal tempe are popular in Malaysia.  Outlets  Javanese households usually purchase fresh ingredients from the local market every morning, cook and serve them in the late morning to be mainly consumed for lunch. The leftovers are stored to be heated again for family dinner. Other than homemade family dishes, Javanese cuisine are served from humble street side carts and warungs, to fancy restaurants in five-star hotels. Small family-run warungs are the budget options for street food, serving everything from family dishes for full meals, or snack foods. The popular simple Javanese cuisine establishments are the budget food of Warung Tegal, which are mainly established by Javanese from Tegal city, and the Angkringan street side carts in Yogyakarta and Solo that sold cheap sego kucing and various wedang (hot beverages). In Javanese tradition, it is common to dine in lesehan style, which is sitting cross-legged on the mat while dining in front of short-legged table. It was started as a warung lesehan street food dining popular among tourists along Malioboro street in Yogyakarta. Today, Javanese lesehan foodstalls can be found in several cities, including Surakarta, Semarang and Jakarta. File:Food at Warung Tegal.jpgFood display in warung Tegal.

Central Javanese cuisine  The food in Central Java is influenced by the two ancient kingdoms of Yogyakarta and Surakarta (also commonly known as Solo). Most of Central Javanese dishes are indigenously developed, however in coastal cities such as Semarang and Pekalongan, notable Chinese influences can be seen, such as lumpia (spring roll) and bakmi Jawa.

Forty Fort, Pennsylvania from 1906  The business community in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, was keen to attract and invest in manufacturing.

Legacy  The sprawling building that housed the manufacturing plant still exists, although heavily modified into a series of commercial business locations. The Matheson building is quite long, taking up more than a block of space on Welles Street in Forty Fort. The anchor business is Matheson Warehouse, an agent of North American Van Lines and operated by several generations of the Hinchey Family. Recently, it was announced that funding for the Welles Street Gateway Project has been awarded as part of the proceeds from state profits garnered from the Mohegan Sun Casino in nearby Plains Township. The Welles Street Gateway Project was the brainchild of former Forty Fort Council President Andy Tuzinski and current Borough Engineer Chris Borton. This project will introduce a \\"Main Street\\" USA motif with retail shops, sidewalks and period lighting.

It starts off as a minor spur route, connecting the West Windsor Recreationway with Huron Church Road and the neighbourhood of South Windsor (via a tunnel under Huron Church Road, and light at Grand Marais Rd. if the tunnel is closed).  Routing and path description  The trail begins as a link to the West Windsor Recreationway, and travels along Grand Marais Road, with a spur branch heading south and under Huron Church Road. The trail continues along its own alignment before leading to bike lanes at West Grand Boulevard. The original path only travelled as far as Balmoral Avenue and California Avenue (both residential streets) until very recently, having been constructed as either a gravel or concrete-paved trail. Bike lanes continue along both sides of Turkey Creek (Grand Marais Road West, and West Grand Boulevard), with a trail bypass heading along Academy Drive and Radisson Court West, before becoming its own trail between houses and Turkey Creek. The trail's three branches all meet up at Bruce Avenue (which is the main thoroughfare for vehicular traffic as well as cycling traffic heading to and from Grand Marais Road), where the routing continues along West Grand Boulevard. In between the three alignments, a bridge connects the Grand Marais Road bike lanes to the \\"bypass\\" (along Academy Drive) and to West Grand Blvd.'s bike lanes at Virginia Park Avenue. The trail continues as a separated path again from intersection of West Grand Boulevard and South Cameron Boulevard on the north side of the road to intersection with Howard Avenue. As it crosses two tracks of the CASO Subdivision CN Rail line at-grade, it continues due north along the west side of Howard Avenue, serving Devonshire Mall and Roundhouse Centre. The path then crosses the Roundhouse Centre/Devonshire Mall plaza entrances and switches to the east side of Howard Avenue, heading due north. The path then crosses the northbound-to-eastbound onramp to E.C. Row Expressway, which currently presents a dangerous situation (high-speed cars and transport trucks driving by without a safe crossing light for pedestrians or cyclists). After this onramp, the path travels underneath E.C. Row Expressway, meeting the already-open stretch of trail just north of the traffic lights serving the westbound offramp. Between Grand Marais Road East and the E.C. Row ramp intersection, the trail heads northeast, with a spur joining it from the intersection of Grand Marais Road. The trail leads north-east, while a second branch continues due north before terminating at Remington Avenue. The main trail heads between Turkey Creek and a few industrial offices. All trail sections and branches are a minimum of four lanes wide (enough width for four bikes to ride side-by-side). The road crosses Elsmere Avenue and Langois Avenue before having a spur branch off to link the trail to Brookview Crescent (and a small playground at the corner of Brookview Cres. as it curves). Langois Avenue and Parent then lead towards the Remington Booster Park and its trail system, and eventually, towards bike lanes on Parent Avenue, with the final end at Riverside Drive and the Riverfront Bike Trail. The next spur heads due south to meet Conservation Drive (which indirectly links the trail to the Devonwood Trail). As the trail passes the Fogolar Furlan club, it splits into two alignments: one curves to the south to meet Parkdale Place, while the main route heads north to meet Turner Road. A \\"temporary crossing for pedestrians and cyclists\\" (as said by the City of Windsor) exists between Grand Marais Road and Memorial Drive, at the intersections of the discontinuous segments of Turner Road, to allow pedestrians to access shops while Walker Road is re-built below the CP Rail line. The current trail (temporary or not) meets the single CP line at-grade, with crossing signals. At Memorial Drive, the trail then meets Walker Road at the Grand Marais intersection, and heads west towards Memorial Park, meeting the trail network in that park. East of Walker Road, the trail continues in several discontinuous segments, though these are expected to be linked together as one long trail serving the Chrysler Minivan Plant. The trail resumes at the south side of the intersection of Chrysler Centre Drive (formerly the southern extension of Drouillard Road) and Grand Marais Road East, continuing until Meldrum Road.  Development of the trail  Much of the Grand Marais Trail can be considered the newest bike trail of the network, as most of the trail has been recently constructed (in 2006, with ongoing extensions currently under construction) along Turkey Creek, around 650 feet (200 m) south of Grand Marais Road, bypassing this very busy, dangerous and heavily-travelled two-lane road (by bikes and cars). The path extends from an intersection with Turner Road, along the creek, with a short (30-ft /10 m) cut-off to Byng Road (a residential street), with a cut-off to Parkdale Place near the Fogolar Furlan club and park, westerly with offshoot trails leading a short distance to nearby streets in the Remington Park subdivision, leading to Conservation Street, which also links to the Devonwood Bike Trail on the other side of E.C. Row Expressway. The road has a major junction with Langois Avenue, as it provides one of two links to the Bike Route along Parent Avenue (and ultimately, Riverfront Trail and Ganatchio Trail), via a short jog on Grand Marais Road. The second is at Ellsmere Avenue. The trail continues west between industrial lots, and the creek, before meeting Howard Avenue and Grand Marais Road, with three branching paths: One north to Remington Street, one straight to the intersection, and one curving south to the E.C. Row/Howard Avenue Interchange, where it will eventually meet up with another extension of the current path under construction to improve access via bike and walking to the Devonshire Mall. The extension has been paved, but it is not open yet, however, and the freeway ramp from Howard Avenue (northbound) to E.C. Row Expressway (eastbound) represents a considerable obstacle, and a safety hazard for pedestrians, cyclists, and automobiles, and is quite busy. It may be possible to link the Devonwood Bike Trail (east of the mall) to the mall from the rear, where traffic is far lighter.

A native of Barbour County, he studied in the University of Alabama, where briefly he was a roommate of future Governor George Wallace . Price ran for many public offices in Alabama, but only won one election - as an alternate delegate to the 1952 Democratic National Convention. Most notably he ran in the Democratic primaries for Governor of Alabama in 1958, 1970, 1974 and 1978. Although he never captured more than 2% of a vote, he once finished before well-known politician Coleman Brown. Price campaigned heartily against his former roommate, Wallace. His slogan was Shorty, Shorty, he’s our man. George Wallace belongs in the garbage can. In 1972 he proposed to shorten the Governor's term from four to two years. Many claimed it was so he could run more often. Although he was never a political power, Price became an important part of southern political and historical folklore in the storied and rich history of colorful candidates in the south. Price was famous for his antics at Crimson Tide football games, which sometimes landed him in jail. In 1979, after Price pleaded guilty to public drunkenness and disorderly conduct charges following the Alabama- Tennessee game at Legion Field in Birmingham, Circuit Judge William Cole told him \\"See you next fall\\" after imposing a $125 fine.

It commemorates a Croatian- Venetian victory over Ottomans on August 14, 1715 in which the local Christian population of around 700 Croats in cooperation with a smaller number of Venetians managed to defend Sinj against 60,000 Ottoman soldiers led by Mehmed-paša Ćelić. Because of this victory, the Venetians retained control over Sinj and integrated it into the Venetian Dalmatia, according to the terms of the Treaty of Passarowitz signed in 1718.Giornale del blocco ed assedio della fortezza di Sign The people of Sinj believe that the Lady of Sinj miraculously drove away Ottomans, thus helping them to defend their town. On the national holiday of the Assumption of Mary (Velika Gospa) on August 15, in honor of Lady of Sinj, a procession is organised, during which horsemen in full regalia (\\"Alkari\\") parade a painting of Our Lady of Sinj throughout the town streets. The Alka itself is an equestrian competition in which various horsemen riding at full gallop aim their lances at a hanging metal ring (alka), and are awarded points according to which sector of the ring they are able to pierce. In 2010, the Alka was inscribed in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.UNESCO: Sinjska Alka, a knights’ tournament in Sinj Objective Scoring in alka: bottom segments are worth 1 point, top segment is worth 2 points, and the central ring is worth 3 points. Alkar Ante Zorica, 4 times winner Alkar helper Whenever Alkar hits the middle (U sridu), a cannon placed on the mountain above Sinj shoots Alka 160 m long racecourse in the center of Sinj Alka is also the name of the object used in the tournament; it is made of two concentric rings (diameter of inner being 35.1 mm, and 131.7 mm of outer one) connected with three bars 120° apart. The object is hung on a rope 3.32 metres above the race track. The contestant (called an alkar) rides his horse down the race track and tries to hit the central ring of the alka with his spear in full gallop. Depending on which part of the alka he hits, he receives from 1 to 3 points, and no points if he misses. If, however, the alkar sends the alka in the air away from its holder and hits any part of it on its way down, he will be awarded 1-3 points for a target hit and an additional three points, thus increasing the maximum to 6 points in one run. The contest consists of three rounds. Participants Only men born in Sinjska krajina (city of Sinj and surrounding villages) can take part in the Alka and it is considered a great privilege to participate in the tournament. The vojvoda (\\"Duke\\") of Alka is a ceremonial title representing the commander of the Alkars. It is a great honour to become the alkar vojvoda, and only the most notable men from Sinjska krajina become one. The costumes worn by the alkar men are the same that were worn by the warriors in the 18th century. History Sinjska Alka was created in the early 18th century as a continuation of knightly competitions that were held across the Venetian Dalmatia: Zadar, Imotski and Makarska. The oldest written mention of Alka are in the three sonnets and an ode written by the Italian poet Julije Bajamonti in 1784. The oldest official file about Alka is a letter of the first Austrian Commissioner for the Austria Dalmatia Count Raymond Thurn that he wrote to the commander of Sinj Josip Grabovac on February 10, 1798. In the letter Count Thurn informs Commander Grabovac that the Palatine Commission from Vienna \\"approved further maintenance of Alka in Sinj on the last day of the carnival\\". At the past Alka was organised at a different time than today, occasionally twice a year (in years: 1798 (the last day of the carnival and on 9 May) and in 1818 (on 15 May and 6 July)). In 1834 it was organised on 9 February, in 1838 on April 19, and in 1855 on October 4 because of cholera. Alka is organised regularly on August 18, which is the birthday of Emperor Franz Joseph, since 1849, as determined by the Statute of 1902. Since then, Alka is organised in August (and under the new rules), in the first third of the month, so that Bara, Čoja and Alka could be organised in the same month. In 1818, during his trip through Dalmatia, the Emperor Francis II visited Sinj, and the locals organized a special Alka in his honor. The Emperor awarded the winner a brilliant ring worth 800 forints. Also, by 1818, Vienna was rewarding the winner a prize of 100 florins, and this was probably main reason for the continuation of this knightly tournament. When the Emperor Franz Joseph rose to power in 1848 he established the award in the amount of 100 forints. From 1902 to 1914 prize awarded to winner was 4000 crowns, and from 1914 to 1918 it was 600 crowns. Alka was repeatedly organised during the visits of rulers or other very important people. On March 28, 1842 Alka was organised in honor of the Austrian Archduke Albrecht during his visit to Sinj, and in the same year on October 22 in honor of the Austrian Archduke Franz Karl. On May 18, 1875 Emperor Franz Joseph visited Sinj. In his honor people of Sinj organised extraordinary solemn Alka. The winner was Mate Bonić. The Emperor awarded him a gold ring. Alka was organised four times outside of Sinj: in 1832 in Split, in 1922 in Belgrade, 1946 in Zagreb and in 2017 in Vukovar. Vicko Grabovac was the longest-running Alka Duke with 28 commands over Alka festivities (1908-1936). Bruno Vuletić was Alka Duke 21 times (1964-1985) and Ivan Vuletić 17 times (1872 - 1894). Rules Alka is an individual equestrian competition in which at least 11 and at most 17 Alkars can participate. The Alkar, a rider on horseback, has to pass the racecourse length 160 m in full gallop in 12 seconds and try to hit the center of a small iron ring called Alka. The Alka is at 3.32 m height, measured from its center to the ground. The Custodian of the Alka (Najmeštač Alke) and his assistant have the responsibility for the proper placement and height of the Alka; the Custodian steadies the pendant ring with a 3.22 m long stick and simultaneously controls the height of it, while his assistant tightens the rope on which the ring hangs. Alka ring The Alka is a ring made of wrought iron and made up of two circuits: the smaller (3.51 cm), and the larger (13.1 cm). The hoops are connected by three arms of which the outer circle divides it into three equal sections. Rims and spokes of Alka are 6.6 mm thick and have a pointed edge on the side facing the Alkar. The loop on which Alka hangs is located on half of one of three equal spans of the larger Alka circle. The aim of the game is to collect as many points in three attempts. During the race, all equipment has to remain on the horse and Alkar, and not one single piece may be allowed to fall off. If this happens without the Alkar being aware of it, he must subsequently seek permission from the Alka Duke for another attempt. However, if an Alkar notices that any item of equipment has fallen off, he must run through with his \\"spear lowered\\" without hitting the Alka.

In television commercials, the clown inhabited a fantasy world called McDonaldland, in which he had adventures with his friends Mayor McCheese, the Hamburglar, Grimace, Birdie the Early Bird and The Fry Kids. By 2003, McDonaldland had been dropped from McDonald's advertising. Many people work full-time making appearances in the Ronald McDonald costume, visiting children in hospitals and attending regular events. At its height there may have been as many as 300 full-time clowns at McDonald's. There are also Ronald McDonald Houses, where parents can stay overnight when visiting sick children in nearby chronic care facilities. History Willard Scott The origin of Ronald McDonald involves Willard Scott (at the time, a local radio personality who also played Bozo the Clown on WRC-TV in Washington, D.C., from 1959 until 1962), who performed using the moniker \\"Ronald McDonald, the Hamburger-Happy Clown\\" in 1963 on three separate television spots. These were the first three television ads featuring the character. Scott, who went on to become NBC-TV's Today Show weatherman, claims to have created Ronald McDonald according to the following excerpt from his book Joy of Living: At the time, Scott was working for Oscar Goldstein, the Washington, DC, area McDonald's franchisee, and numerous sources describe Scott's role as only playing the part of Ronald McDonald, while giving credit for the creation of the mascot to Goldstein and his ad agency.  McDonald's version  thumb McDonald's does not mention George Voorhis or acknowledge that Willard Scott created Ronald in their statement: Nonetheless, on March 28, 2000, Henry Gonzalez, McDonald's Northeast Division President, thanked Scott for creating Ronald McDonald during a taped tribute to Scott on the Today Show. The character first appeared in national TV advertising in 1965, during the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, and followed with spots during the 1966 Superbowl. Circus performer Coco the Clown (real name Michael Polakovs) was hired in 1966 to revamp Ronald's image, creating the now familiar costume and make-up. In 2010, the Corporate Accountability International in Boston, Massachusetts, suggested Ronald McDonald should retire due to childhood obesity. However, McDonald's CEO Jim Skinner said there are no plans to retire him. In April 2011, McDonald's announced that Ronald McDonald will reappear in their commercials, but Ace Metrix stated Ronald McDonald ads are no longer effective. On May 18, 2011, Corporate Accountability International renewed their call to retire Ronald McDonald by running ads in major newspapers and launching several web pages dedicated to the retirement of the character. However, McDonald's CEO Jim Skinner defended Ronald McDonald by saying that he is an ambassador for good and \\"it's all about choice\\". Shortly after, McDonald's announced that Ronald McDonald was \\"here to stay\\". In April 2014, McDonald's announced that Ronald McDonald would have a whole new look and new outfits. They also announced that he would be featured in their new commercials as well as on social media websites like Twitter. As part of Ronald's makeover, his jumpsuit has been dropped in favor of yellow cargo pants, a vest and a red-and-white striped rugby shirt; his classic clown shoes remain part of the official uniform.  Actors  alt= The original Ronald McDonald as pictured on the United States trademark application filed in 1967At any given time, there are dozens to hundreds of actors retained by McDonald's to appear as Ronald McDonald in restaurants and events. It is assumed, however, that the company uses only one actor at a time to play the character in national television commercials. Following is a list of primary American Ronald McDonald actors. * Willard Scott (Washington, D.C. 1963–1965) * Bev Bergeron (Southern California, 1966–1968) * George Voorhis (Southern California, 1968–1970) * Michael Polakovs (1965–1968) * Ray Rayner (1968–1969) * Viv Weekes (1968–1970) (local) * Bob Brandon (1970–1975) (local)http://www.thelavendereffect.org/2013/04/25/april-25-in-lgbtq-history// * King Moody (1969–1985) * Squire Fridell (1985–1991) * Jack Doepke (1991–1999) * David Hussey (2000–2014) * Brad Lennon (2014–present) Various forms of the name \\"Ronald McDonald\\" as well as costume clown face persona, etc. are registered trademarks of McDonald's. McDonald's trains performers to portray Ronald using identical mannerisms and costume, to contribute to the illusion that they are one character. McDonald's marketing designers and stylists changed elements of the Ronald McDonald character, persona, style, costume and clown face when they adopted the clown as a trademark. Joe Maggard claim An actor named Joe Maggard claimed to have performed as Ronald McDonald from 1995 to 2007, though these dates overlap with the portrayals by Jack Doepke and David Hussey. In a 2003 article by The Baltimore Sun, a spokesperson for McDonald's said that Mr. Maggard was simply a stand-in for Ronald for one commercial shoot in the mid-1990s, and stated that \\"he is definitely not Ronald McDonald.\\" International localization A statue of Ronald McDonald at a military base in alt= In Thailand, Ronald McDonald greets people in the traditional Thai \\"wai\\" greeting gesture of both hands pressed together.

Film Ronald McDonald appears for a few seconds in the 1988 film Mac and Me during a birthday scene set at a McDonald's. He is played by Squire Fridell, but is credited as \\"Ronald McDonald as himself\\". He won a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst New Star for his appearance in the film. The character also prominently appears in the theatrical trailer for the film. Subversion Because of his prominence, Ronald McDonald has become a symbol, not just of McDonald's but of the fast food industry in the US as a whole, as well as Corporate America, capitalism, globalization and other broader topics. The costume and iconography of Ronald McDonald are often appropriated by protestors and artists wishing to subvert the icon and communicate an anti-corporate message. For example, in 2000, protestors in Hong Kong dressed as Ronald McDonald to protest McDonald's labor policy in China. Criticism and failed retirement Deposition of Ronald by Artis Love - Public art in Vienna Critics claimed that a clown mascot targeting children for fast food is unethical. A group of 550 doctors took out newspaper ads in 2011, insisting Ronald McDonald retire. References Further reading * Schlosser, E.

Background The invention of the self-propelled torpedo by Robert Whitehead and Austrian Navy Captain Giovanni Luppis in 1866, combined with the introduction of small fast torpedo boats (invented by John Ericsson in the late 19th century) posed a threat to battleships: large numbers of torpedo boats could overwhelm a battleship's defences and sink it, or distract the battleship and make it vulnerable to opposing capital ships. Torpedo boats proved devastatingly effective in the 1891 Chilean Civil War. The defence against torpedo boats was clear: small warships accompanying the fleet that could screen and protect it from attack by torpedo boats. Several European navies developed vessels variously known as torpedo boat \\"catchers\\", \\"hunters\\" and \\"destroyers\\", while the Royal Navy itself operated torpedo gunboats. However, the early designs lacked the range and speed to keep up with the fleet they were supposed to protect. In 1892, the Third Sea Lord, Rear Admiral Jackie Fisher ordered the development of a new type of ships equipped with the then novel water-tube boilers and quick-firing small-calibre guns. Orders Six ships to the specifications circulated by the Admiralty were ordered initially, comprising three different designs each produced by a different shipbuilder: * and from John I. Thornycroft & Company * and from Yarrows (the ) * and from Laird, Son & Company (the ) Design These boats all featured a turtleback (i.e. rounded) forecastle that was characteristic of early British TBDs. All six of them were removed from service and disposed of by the end of 1912, and thus were not affected by the Admiralty decision in 1913 to group all the surviving 27-knot and 30-knot destroyers (which had followed on these six 26-knot vessels) into four heterogeneous classes, labelled \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\" and \\"D\\" classes. and were both built by Thornycroft, displaced 260 tons (287.8 tons full load) and were in length. They were armed with one 12-pounder gun and three 6-pounder guns, with one fixed 18-in torpedo tube in the bow plus two more torpedo tubes on a revolving mount abaft the two funnels. Later the bow torpedo tube was removed and two more 6-pounder guns added instead. They produced from a pair of Thornycroft water-tube boilers, giving them a top speed of 27 knots. In common with subsequent early Thornycroft boats, they had sloping sterns and double rudders.

Sisi Star Heist A portrait of Empress Elisabeth of Austria in Courtly Gala Dress with Diamond Stars (by Franz Xaver Winterhalter) In 1998, Blanchard stole the Star of Empress Sisi, one of 27 diamond-and-pearl hair ornaments worn by Elisabeth of Bavaria, consort of Francis Joseph I, from the Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna, Austria. Police thought that, accompanied by his wife and father-in-law posing as tourists, Blanchard disabled the alarm and replaced the jewel with a replica purchased at the souvenir shop. A parachute was found hidden near the Palace grounds. Blanchard later said that he parachuted onto the Palace roof from a small airplane in the middle of the night to make the swap. A few days before the heist, he toured the palace with his wife and father-in-law while video recording the layout. Police recovered a video tape on one of the many raids of Blanchard's high-end properties, leading up to the theft and the calculated planning. It took two weeks before the swap was discovered. The loss of a priceless part of Austria’s history remained unsolved until Blanchard offered to turn the jewel over to police following his arrest in Canada on Fraud and robbery charges for cleaning out financial institutions at night without using any violence and being good-hearted. He took police to the Sisi Star where he had hidden it in his grandmother's basement in Winnipeg. In return for the Star Blanchard's co-accuseds would only receive conditional sentences. Blanchard never identified his accomplices in any of his global heists, and he was the only one to do serious prison time. The priceless Köchert Diamond Pearl was returned to Austria by a Canadian Crown Attorney in 2009. Blanchard pleaded guilty at the Court of Queen's Bench of Manitoba on 7 November 2007 to sixteen charges of robbery and fraud in Canada and elsewhere in the world. Blanchard faced a maximum of 164 years in prison for the sixteen charges to which he pleaded guilty but was sentenced to just eight years in prison in the Winnipeg court as part of a plea deal in which he cooperated with authorities through his Lawyer Danny Gunn from Campbell Gunn Inness Law firm only to turned over the Köchert Diamond Pearl. He was paroled after serving two years. After prison In January 2010, Blanchard was released and was reported to be attempting to develop himself a new career as a security consultant.

On trial she made headlines as the 'Fastest Boat Ever'. The introduction of steam turbines after 1897 quickly made her and her sisters obsolete and she was sold off in 1912. Construction The ship was laid down as yard number 287 at the Thornycroft yard at Chiswick in July 1892. She was launched on 25 November 1893 following the naming ceremony by Mrs Thornycroft, the wife of the company founder John Isaac Thornycroft. When Daring failed the sea trial cavitation was analyzed more deeply for the first time.Introduction for amazing (cavitation) bubbles, Shengcai Li,1 Christopher E.

Daring commenced her trials off Gravesend on 17 January 1894 and soon moved to the measured mile at Maplin Sands near Southend. On 19 July she managed a speed of 28.21 knots over the measured mile, exceeding her design speed and earning her the sobriquet of the 'Fastest Boat Ever'. Her coal consumption trial on 18 September showed that on one ton of coal she could travel nearly 38 nautical miles at 10 knots on one boiler. She was completed in February 1895. Service history Daring appears to have served in home waters between 1895 and 1912. She was commissioned at Portsmouth on 23 February 1900 as tender to , gunnery school situated on Whale Island near Portsmouth. In early June 1901 a boiler explosion occurred on board Daring at anchor off Portsmouth, causing the death of a crew-member and injuring several others. An inquiry showed that some tubes were blown out of the lower drum, thus freeing a flood of scalding water and steam. She was passed into the Fleet reserve at Portsmouth in early June 1902, and later the same month joined the instructional flotilla at Plymouth. Lieutenant A. S. Susmann was appointed in command on 8 August 1902, and the following month she became tender to , gunnery school ship off Plymouth. Later in September 1902, however, she was reported to be part of a squadron visiting Nauplia and Souda Bay at Crete in the Mediterranean Sea. On 26 October 1907 a minor collision took place between Daring and the destroyer at Devonport, both ships' hulls being dented. Daring was sold on 10 April 1912.Lyon (1996), p.43.

He was the co-pilot of the Enola Gay, the B-29 Superfortress bomber which dropped the atomic bomb Little Boy on the Japanese city of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945.  Military career  Lewis grew up in Ridgefield Park, New Jersey, and attended Ridgefield Park High School, graduating in 1937. During World War II, he had to wait after enlisting to be processed into the USAAF Officer Candidate School (OCS). Lewis went on to be a multi-engine test pilot in B-24, B-26, B-17 and B-29 bombers, which later led to him as co-pilot and his crew being selected for the Hiroshima bombing mission. Lewis was field promoted to captain by General Curtis LeMay after demonstrating the B-29 and training the general on how to fly it. LeMay addressed Lieutenant Lewis as \\"Captain Lewis\\" on the field at the conclusion of several days of training and testing. Lewis tried to correct the general as to his rank, but LeMay insisted on captain, with the field commission arriving several weeks later by USAAF mail to him based in the midwestern US at the time. Lewis was always a \\"crew-first\\" pilot who survived two crashes due to electrical failure and engine failure. Articles from New York City area newspapers attested to his \\"cool head under stressful conditions\\", ultimately leading to his selection as captain of a B-29 crew. Lewis led hundreds of bombing runs from Utah to Salton Sea in California leading up to his selection with his crew by Colonel Paul Tibbets. In early June, Lewis and his co-pilot Dick McNamara flew the entire crew and support crew from Utah to Tinian, in the B-29 specially modified to carry Little Boy to Japan from the huge Tinian base that General LeMay controlled from Guam. On August 6, 1945 – August 5 in the United States, due to the time difference – Lewis was the co-pilot of the Enola Gay when it dropped Little Boy on Hiroshima. Normally the aircraft commander assigned to the Enola Gay, for this important mission he acted as co-pilot, assisting Enola Gay's new aircraft commander, Colonel Tibbets. Lewis and his crew, minus their original co-pilot Dick McNamara, were Tibbets' crew for the mission, and it included two specialists for the arming of Little Boy, the uranium-235 fission bomb. The entire story was written by Lewis just before his death in 1983. His log, the only minute-by-minute recording on paper by any crew member that day, is part of his copyrighted historical manuscript. His sons and daughter are in the process of publishing the manuscript before the 75th anniversary of the bombing in 2020.  Post-war  After the war, Lewis became a pilot for American Overseas Airlines, specializing in the New York to London routes. He left in 1947 to rejoin his prewar employer, the Henry Heide Candy Company, where he became plant manager and personnel director of their factory in New Brunswick, New Jersey. He was granted at least three patents during his time at Heide. In the 1950s, Lewis lived with his family in a home that he had built in Old Tappan, New Jersey. He and his wife had a daughter and four sons. Survivor meetings In New York City in 1951, Lewis met Hiroshima survivor Father Hubert Schiffer, who was eight blocks from ground zero when the explosion occurred and was seriously injured. Schiffer invited Lewis to visit Hiroshima in August 1952 for the dedication of a \\"palace of prayer\\", which Lewis accepted; however, there is no record of Lewis actually making such a visit. The two also appeared together at Fordham University in 1957, on the twelfth anniversary of the bombing, with Schiffer noting that they had become \\"very fast friends.\\" In 1955, Lewis appeared on the television show This is Your Life, in an episode not without controversy. The show had as its guest Reverend Kiyoshi Tanimoto, who had been living in Hiroshima at the time of the bombing and survived the explosion, as recounted in John Hersey's 1946 book Hiroshima. Tanimoto had traveled to the United States with the Hiroshima Maidens to get reconstructive surgery for them, and while there was the subject of the May 11 episode of This Is Your Life. After some acquaintances were introduced and interviewed, a surprise for Tanimoto was meeting Lewis – on live television broadcast to a nationwide audience – representing the crew of the aircraft that had so dramatically changed his life. Contemporary reaction to the episode was mixed, ranging from \\"one of [the] best\\" to a \\"new low in poor taste.\\" Lewis described the Enola Gay's flight and the dropping of the bomb on Hiroshima. When asked by host Ralph Edwards if he remembered his reaction on that fateful day, he remarked, \\"I wrote down later, 'My God, what have we done?' \\" Later life Lewis became a self-taught stone sculptor, working in marble and alabaster, following a business trip to Florence where he saw some apprentices at work. One of his sculptures, titled ‘God’s Wind’ at Hiroshima?, depicted a mushroom cloud. In the 1970s, Lewis lived in a small cottage on West Shore Trail in the quiet Lake Mohawk community of Sparta, New Jersey. In 1971, Lewis sold his manuscript log from the Hiroshima mission, which he had written during the flight at the request of journalist William L. Laurence; it was auctioned by Christies and sold for $37,000. The manuscript was later resold to Malcolm Forbes, and after Forbes' death was purchased by an anonymous buyer. Prior to the 1971 sale, Lewis made six hand-written copies of the log, one each for his wife and five children; one copy was sold in 2015 for $50,000. In 1975, Lewis took a position with the Estee Candy Corporation, until his retirement in 1981. He was portrayed by Gregory Harrison in the 1980 television film Enola Gay: The Men, the Mission, the Atomic Bomb. Lewis lived in Smithfield, Virginia, for two years before his death in 1983 of a heart attack at home; he was declared dead at Riverside Hospital in Newport News, Virginia. In 1990, Lewis' widow put up for auction a manuscript navigator's log from the Hiroshima mission, however it failed to sell after questions arose about its authenticity, with Enola Gay navigator Theodore Van Kirk stating that he still had the log he wrote during the mission.

The term \\"Jōmon\\" (縄文) means \\"rope-patterned\\" in Japanese, describing the patterns that are pressed into the clay.  Outline   Oldest pottery in Japan  The pottery vessels crafted in Ancient Japan during the Jōmon period are generally accepted to be the oldest pottery in Japan and among the oldest in the world.  Dating  Odai Yamamoto I site in Aomori Prefecture currently has the oldest pottery in Japan. Excavations in 1998 uncovered forty-six earthenware fragments which have been dated as early as 14,500 BC (ca 16,500 BP); this places them among the earliest pottery currently known. This appears to be plain, undecorated pottery. Such a date puts the development of pottery before the warming at the end of the Pleistocene. 'Linear-relief' pottery was also found at Fukui Cave Layer III dating to 13,850–12,250 BC. This site is located in Nagasaki Prefecture, Kyushu. Both linear-relief, and 'nail-impressed' pottery were found at Torihama shell mound, in Fukui prefecture, dating to 12000-11000 BC.Junko Habu, Ancient Jomon of Japan.

Database on-line. Springerlink; accessed October 3, 2007. It is believed by many that Jōmon pottery was probably made even earlier than this date. However, due to ambiguity and multiple sources claiming different dates based on different dating techniques, it is difficult to say for sure how far back Jōmon Pottery was made. Some sources claim archaeological discoveries as far back as the 14th millennium BCE.Kuzmin, Yaroslav V. “Chronology of the earliest pottery in East Asia: progress and pitfalls.” Antiquity 80, (2006): 362–371. Database on- line. EBSCOhost; accessed October 3, 2007.  Chronology  The Jōmon Period in Ancient Japan lasted until roughly 300 BCE. From there, it is divided into six periods: Incipient Jōmon, from 10,500–8,000 BCE, Earliest Jōmon, from 8,000–5,000 BCE, Early Jōmon, from 5,000–2,500 BCE, Middle Jōmon, from 2,500- 1,500 BCE, Late Jōmon, from 1,500–1,000 BCE, and Final Jōmon, from 1,000–300 BCE.Hall, M.

Academic Search Complete, EBSCOhost; accessed October 5, 2007. There are over 80 sites in Japan where Incipient Jōmon pottery vessels have been found, but the majority of Jōmon pottery remains come from the later periods. It was later followed by the Yayoi pottery.  Characteristics  The majority of Jōmon pottery has rounded bottoms and the vessels are usually small. This shows that the vessels would typically be used to boil food, perhaps fitting into a fire.Pearson, Richard. “Debating Jomon Social Complexity.” Asian Perspectives 46, no.2 (2007): 361–388. Database on-line. Project Muse; accessed October 5, 2007. Later Jōmon pottery pieces are more elaborate, especially during the Middle Jōmon period, where the rims of pots became much more complex and decorated. The name Jōmon itself means “rope-patterned”. This refers to the impressions on the surface of the pottery which were created by pressing rope into the clay before it was heated to approximately 600–900 degrees Celsius. A specific type of clay figurines produced during this period are the dogū.

By the time of the Fraser by-election, Hill had resigned from the Liberal Party because of the party's attitude to race and immigration, and chose to run as an independent.Hill, Cheryl Anne, Australian Women Biographical Entry. Results Aftermath The by-election was won easily by Steve Dargavel, the ALP candidate, who held the seat until 1998 when he lost preselection in favour of Bob McMullan. Dargavel's election saw only a minor swing away from the ALP, a remarkable result since the by-election fielded ten candidates in contrast to three candidates in the previous general election in 1996. In contrast to Dargavel as the ALP candidate, the absence of the Liberal Party in the by-election and with their 1996 candidate Cheryl Hill running as an independent, the by-election saw Hill's personal vote dropped more than 20% in the primary vote and a fall of 8% in the two-candidate preferred basis.

Nineteen presidents have led the school over the years while the school has been transformed from a single building to a campus of and approximately 30,000 students in 2015. Corvallis College Corvallis College in 1876 In 1856, a school building was constructed in the Willamette Valley at Corvallis.Horner, John B. (1919). Oregon: Her History, Her Great Men, Her Literature. The J.K. Gill Co.: Portland. p. 164-5 The structure would serve as home to a private academy until 1858. Named Corvallis Academy, this was the area's first community school for primary and preparatory education. The local chapter of the Freemasons played an important role in developing the concept to eventually establish a state college in the city and initiated the construction of the early campus with the original donation of land. In 1858, what would become Oregon State University began as Corvallis College as it was formally incorporated by members of the Freemasons. At that time the school did not offer college level courses. Years later the school's ownership was transferred to the Methodist Episcopal Church. In 1865, William A. Finley was named as the school's first president. The school as began offering a bachelor's degree that year. State school Corvallis College was incorporated by the church in 1868, and the state of Oregon designated the school as the State Agricultural College (SAC). In 1873, the school became the first West Coast school to offer a course in agriculture. The two-year program had been approved by the Oregon Legislative Assembly. State Agricultural College became a completely state run school in 1885. In 1889, the original building of Corvallis College was torn down. In 1888 the college informally became known as Oregon Agricultural College (OAC), a name not made official until 1907. Three women in a dormitory room in Waldo Hall c. 1905 By 1934, Mary J. L. McDonald made donations that allowed for the purchase of the land that comprises the McDonald Forest owned by the school, which also includes Peavy Arboretum. Oregon State Weatherford Hall built in 1928. The building is named after James K. Weatherford, longtime head of the university's Board of Regents. A growing diversity in degree programs offered led to another name change in 1937, when the college became Oregon State College. Naval ROTC, and the program of Naval Sciences, were added to the existing Army ROTC program in 1946. The Air Force ROTC program was included in 1949, making Oregon State one of only 33 universities in the country to offer officer training for all branches of the United States Armed Forces. Although OSU's focus was solidly on agriculture, engineering and other vocational subjects, the novelist Bernard Malamud spent the 1940s and 1950s teaching English Composition there. His experiences as a professor were the basis for his novel A New Life. He was also awarded the 1967 Pulitzer Prize for his novel The Fixer, named after a store in downtown Corvallis. Linus Pauling, Class of 1922, became Oregon State's first Nobel Laureate alumnus in 1954 when he received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work elucidating the nature of the atomic bonds. In 1962, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his campaign against nuclear weapons testing. He joined Marie Curie as the only person to win two different Nobels. Curie's physics prize was shared with her husband, Pierre Curie. Both of Pauling's prizes were unshared.

She reached a speed of over the measured mile and a six-hour average speed of during official trials on 15 December 1894. Ardent was completed on 25 March 1895. Service history The torpedo boat destroyer was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 30 April 1895 at Portsmouth under the command of Lieutenant & Commander Godfrey H B Mundy for service on the Mediterranean Station based at Malta. Ardent departed Portsmouth on 14 May 1895, stopping at Plymouth to join the third-class cruiser . They departed for Malta on 15 May 1895. Upon her arrival she became tender to the fleet flagship, the battleship . Among Ardent′s duties was the training of stokers in the management of water-tube boilers. On 31 March 1901, Ardent was listed as being at Malta for the British Empire census. In April 1902 she was on tactical and gunnery exercises with the Mediterranean Fleet, and in September that year she was part of a squadron visiting the Aegean Sea for combined manoeuvres near Nauplia and Souda Bay at Crete.

Its formula is PsH. It was predicted to exist in 1951 by A Ore, and subsequently studied theoretically, but was not observed until 1990. R. Pareja, R. Gonzalez from Madrid trapped positronium in hydrogen laden magnesia crystals. The trap was prepared by Yok Chen from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. In this experiment the positrons were thermalized so that they were not traveling at high speed, and they then reacted with H− ions in the crystal. In 1992 it was created in an experiment done by David M. Schrader and F.M. Jacobsen and others at the Aarhus University in Denmark. The researchers made the positronium hydride molecules by firing intense bursts of positrons into methane, which has the highest density of hydrogen atoms. Upon slowing down, the positrons were captured by ordinary electrons to form positronium atoms which then reacted with hydrogen atoms from the methane. Decay PsH is constructed from one proton, two electrons, and one positron. The binding energy is . The lifetime of the molecule is 0.65 nanoseconds. The lifetime of positronium deuteride is indistinguishable from the hydride. The decay of positronium is easily observed by detecting the two 511 keV gamma ray photons emitted in the decay. The energy of the photons from positronium should differ slightly by the binding energy of the molecule. However this has not yet been detected. Properties The structure of PsH is as a diatomic molecule, with a chemical bond between the two positively charged centres. The electrons are more concentrated around the proton. Predicting the properties of PsH is a four body Coulomb problem. Calculated using the stochastic variational method, the size of the molecule is larger than dihydrogen, which has a bond length of 0.7413 Å. In PsH the positron and proton are separated on average by 3.66 a0 (1.94 Å). The positronium in the molecule is swollen compared to the positronium atom, increasing to 3.48 a0 compared to 3 a0. Average distance of the electrons from the proton is larger than the dihydrogen molecule, at 2.31 a0 with the maximum density at 2.8 au. Formation Due to its short lifetime, establishing the chemistry of positronium hydride poses difficulties. Theoretical calculations can predict what can happen. One method of formation is through alkali metal hydrides reacting with positrons. Molecules with dipole moments greater than 1.625 debye are predicted to attract and hold positrons in a bound state. Crawford's model predicts this positron capture. However in the case of lithium hydride, sodium hydride and potassium hydride molecules, this adduct decomposes and positronium hydride and the alkali positive ion form. Similar compounds PsH is a simple exotic compound. Other compounds of positronium are possible by the reactions e+ \\\\+ AB → PsA + B+. Other substances that contain positronium are di-positronium and the ion Ps− with two electrons. Molecules of Ps with normal matter include halides and cyanide.

He may have attended Winchester College as a schoolboy as his elder brother George is known to have done, but nothing is known for sure of his activities until 1744 when he received a commission to join the 10th Dragoons as a cornet. In the Dragoons Pitt registered solid if unspectacular service and was not engaged on active service until the outbreak of the Seven Years' War in 1756.Pitt, George, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, G. F. R. Barker, Retrieved 28 November 2007 Pitt's wartime records are vague, but he gained distinction for his bravery in action and was severely wounded and taken prisoner at the Battle of Kloster Kampen in 1760. Released on parole, Pitt returned to his regiment at the war's conclusion and was made a full colonel. Between 1754 and 1761 Pitt had been the Member of Parliament for Wareham, a Dorset constituency with approximately 500 voters. He lost his seat whilst a prisoner in France and did not enter politics again, even after his brother's elevation to the House of Lords. In 1763 Pitt married Mary Howe, the daughter of Emanuel Howe, 2nd Viscount Howe. They had no children. In 1770 Pitt was promoted to major- general while maintaining the colonelcy of the 12th Dragoons. His forces were not deployed during the American Revolutionary War and in 1775 he transferred to be Colonel to the 3rd Regiment of Horse (Carabiniers), again not seeing any action. In 1777 he was promoted to lieutenant general and in 1784 became commander of all the British forces in Ireland, a post he retained until 1791, when he was made a Knight Companion of the Order of the Bath. At the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1793, Pitt was promoted to full general but his age and lack of military service precluded any active postings and in 1794 he was given the shore command of the Portsmouth defences, a post he retained until 1809 when he died at his estate, Highfield House, in Hampshire aged over eighty. Despite his relatively uneventful service, Pitt continued to exert influence at Army headquarters throughout his life.

Davis, 370 U.S. 65 (1962), is a federal income tax case argued before the United States Supreme Court in 1962, holding that a taxpayer recognizes a gain on the transfer of appreciated property in satisfaction of a legal obligation.United States v. Davis, . In 1984, \\"having heard criticism of the Davis/Farid rule for many years,\\" Congress overruled the main holding: Under § 1041(a), no gain or loss shall be recognized by the transferor-spouse (or former spouse, but \\"only if the transfer is incident to divorce\\"); as a corollary, §1041(b) provides that transferor's basis shall carry over into the hands of the transferee-spouse. (Thus, for transfers between spouses, §1041(b) overrules the lower-of-cost-or-market rule for determining loss on subsequent sale of a gift, in §1015.) Facts Pursuant to a separation agreement, the taxpayer's (ex-)wife agreed to relinquish any potential claims or marital rights, in exchange for which he transferred to her 1,000 shares of stock in DuPont. These shares had cost him $74,775.37, and had appreciated to $82,250 at the time of the transfer. The government argued that the appreciation should be included in the taxpayer's gross income, viewing the transfer of property as an exchange for the release of an independent legal obligation. The taxpayer argued that the appreciation should not count as gross income, since the transfer was more like a division of property between co-owners than a sale that resulted in gain.Davis, 370 U.S. at 69. Holding The Supreme Court held that the $7,000 appreciation should count as gross income, as \\"the 'amount realized' from the exchange is the fair market value of the released marital rights, which in this case would be equal to the value of the stock transferred.\\"See Philadelphia Park Amusement Co. v. United States, 126 F.Supp. 184 (U.S. Court of Claims, 1954), determining that the fair market value of consideration of indeterminable value is equal to the value of the property exchanged for it, assuming arms-length transaction. Further Reasoning The court bolstered its position by arguing that the lower court's ruling (that the value of the released marital rights is indeterminable and therefore, not included in gross income) could prejudice the taxpayer's spouse, as her basis in the shares would not include the $7,000 appreciation, and she would have to include this in her gross income if she decided to sell the shares. Overruled by Congress In response to this decision, Congress enacted Internal Revenue Code § 1041. This statute provides that, generally, \\"no gain or loss shall be recognized on a transfer of property from an individual to...(2) a former spouse, but only if the transfer is incident to divorce.\\" While this statute overrules the specific holding of Davis, it does not change the general rule—that \\"a taxpayer recognizes a gain on the transfer of appreciated property in satisfaction of a legal obligation.\\"Donaldson (2007), 136. These legislative changes were regarded by most tax specialists as overdue and welcome, because the Davis/Farid rule had a number of weaknesses:Chirelstein (2005), 93. *It had been a complicating factor in divorce settlements *It resulted in better treatment for residents of community property states (since the Service had held that it would not apply Davis to an equal division of community property) that for residents of common law jurisdictions. *It added considerably to the Treasury's enforcement burden—the Treasury ran the risk that gain would be reported by neither spouse, unless it was prepared to audit every substantial property settlement: :*transferor-spouses sometimes seemed not to know about Davis or to find it counter-intuitive, and hence often omitted to report their taxable gain when property was transferred. :*By contrast, transferee-spouses, well aware of Farid, almost invariably computed their gain(loss) on subsequent sale by using a basis equal to fair market value at time of receipt.

The Victorian Baptist Women’s Association (VBWA) suggested that Strathalan become a home for the elderly. The VBWA raised 4,000 pounds over four years to re-open the homestead as Strathalan Home for the Elderly. In 1945, the first of Baptcare's aged care homes, Baptcare Strathalan Community opened. In 1959, Baptcare Karana Community was constructed. In 1960, Baptcare Northaven Community was opened.

The first historical sequence shows Mary as the Queen of Syria who cruelly executes a young goldsmith and jeweller (played by the same actor as Eduard). Back in the present, Mary has arranged an assignation with both Harber and Eduard, neither knowing of the intentions of the other, at night in a summerhouse. While waiting for them she falls asleep: an Expressionist dream shows Harber and Eduard fighting over her, and Eduard killing his father. This is succeeded by the main historical sequence, the wickedness and destruction of Sodom, in which Mary now appears as Lea (Lia), Lot's wife. The dreams shock Mary into a realisation of the true nature and consequences of her behaviour, and she returns in penitence to Harry. Production The producer was Sascha Kolowrat-Krakowsky, who according to contemporary film magazinesas quoted by Walter Fritz: see below came up with the idea, while on a trip to United States to discover more about the American film industry, of making an epic film with many extras in Austria, as such films - \\"Intolerance\\" seems to have been a particular model - were very popular at that time in the US and Kolowrat-Krakowsky had America in view as an additional potential market. For this purpose he founded the Herz Film Corporation in New York City as a branch of his Austria company Sascha-Film. In the film, produced between 1920 and 1922, Mihaly Kertész (later known in the US as Michael Curtiz) directed, and his Hungarian wife Lucy Doraine played the leading role of Mary Conway. Walter Slezak played Edward, the young son of her fiancé. Among the extras, according to their own accounts, were Willi Forst, Hans Thimig, Paula Wessely and Béla Balázs. The film is unique in Austrian film history on account of its sheer scale, in which it reputedly surpassed the American epics, the Italian films of classical antiquity and the German historical dramas. Thousands of craftsmen, architects, decorators, sculptors, stuccoists, stage and set builders, pyrotechnicians, cameramen, hairdressers, mask makers and tailors, with assistants, labourers and extras, mostly the unemployed and juveniles, found employment for three years during the making of the film, in an Austria crippled by inflation and unemployment. Thousands of costumes, wigs, beards, sandals, standards, horse harnesses and other such things were made specially for the production, generally on site. Béla Balász referred to it as \\"prop madness\\".Ausstattungswahnsinn; see Walter Fritz's book below Sodom und Gomorrha cost more than five times the planned budget and in later films, on the basis of such expensive experiences, expenditure on props was drastically reduced. The outdoor shoots were made at the Laaerberg near Vienna, in the Lainzer Tiergarten, in Laxenburg, in Schönbrunn and on the Steirischer Erzberg. The Laaerberg was particularly suitable for filming, as at this time it was a waste area, with a few clay pits filled with water. Just for the preliminary construction and erection of the backdrops several thousand workers were required. During filming between 300 and 500 actors were always needed, for crowd scenes as many as 3,000. In addition similar quantities of horses were required for some scenes. At the end of the film the temple was supposed to collapse, for which pyrotechnicians were appointed to blow it up. However, there were accidents, causing injuries and deaths, which were to have legal consequences. The director was acquitted, but the chief pyrotechnician was arrested for 10 days and fined 500,000 Kronen. Background Many of those of worked on this film later became leading names in their fields. The cameraman Franz Planer made a career in Hollywood, as did the director Michael Curtiz and the actor Walter Slezak, who also emigrated a few years later. Gustav Ucicky, employed as a cameraman, later became a successful director in Germany and Austria. The set designer and builder Julius von Borsody worked for decades longer in this capacity in Austrian films. After the film was finished, Michael Curtiz and Lucy Doraine were divorced. Architecture The film's architectural masterpiece, designed by three architects, was the \\"Temple of Sodom\\", which was counted as one of the world's great film structures of the time. Under the direction of the architect Julius von Borsody his assistants Hans Rouc and Stefan Wessely worked with specialist companies such as Mautner und Rothmüller the Österreichische Filmdienst on the monumental buildings of Sodom, Gomorrha and Syria. A noticeable feature of the architecture of the buildings was the ornament, strongly reminiscent of Jugendstil. The dream scenes featured Expressionist architecture. Further staff The production design was by Julius Borsidine and Edgar G. Ulmer. Remigius Geyling, costume designer at the Burgtheater, was responsible for the costumes, including the design of the headgear for Lucy Doraine, who, even in the edition available today, has 11 different costumes. Arthur Gottlein was the production assistant. Performance For the première in Berlin Giuseppe Becce was engaged, probably the most prominent film composer in Germany at this period. His musical accompaniment borrowed from a wide range of classical, mostly romantic, music of all types. Next to works by famous composers such as Tschaikovsky, Bizet, Massenet, Sibelius and Verdi he used works by less well- known composers, such as the Hans Heiling overture by Heinrich Marschner, the overture from the opera Yelva by Carl Gottlieb Reissiger and others. Versions The original version was 3,900 metres long, representing a running time of about three hours. The film was therefore generally shown in two parts: Part I: Die Sünde (\\"The Sin\\") and Part II: Die Strafe (\\"The Punishment\\"). By 1987 only 25 minutes remained in the possession of the Österreichische Filmarchiv. Further sections of the film were obtained however from the Soviet Film Archive, and the film archives of the DDR and Czechoslovakia, as well as from Bologna and Hungary, so that although the whole film is not recovered, all four sequences have now been restored. The restored version has a running time of 98 minutes.

Under the pseudonym Anna O., she was also one of Josef Breuer's best documented patients because of Freud's writing on Breuer's case.  Biography   Childhood and youth  Bertha Pappenheim was born on 27 February 1859 in Vienna, the third daughter of Sigmund Pappenheim and Recha Pappenheim. Her father Sigmund (1824–1881), a merchant, the son of an Orthodox Jewish family from Preßburg, Austria-Hungary (today's Bratislava, Slovakia), was the cofounder of the Orthodox Schiffschul in Vienna; the family name alludes to the Franconian town of Pappenheim. Her mother Recha, née Goldschmidt (1830–1905), was from an old and wealthy family in Frankfurt am Main. As \\"just another daughter\\" in a strictly traditional Jewish household, Bertha was conscious that her parents would have preferred a male child. Her parents' families held traditional Jewish views on marriage and had roots in Orthodox Judaism. Bertha was raised in the style of a well-bred young lady of good class. She attended a Roman Catholic girls' school and led a life structured by the Jewish holiday calendar and summer vacations in Ischl. When she was eight years old her oldest sister Henriette (1849–1867) died of \\"galloping consumption.\\"Jensen, Ellen M. (1984). Streifzüge durch das Leben von Anna O./Bertha Pappenheim: Ein Fall für die Psychiatrie – Ein Leben für die Philanthropie. Frankfurt am Main: ZTV Verlag. p. 19. According to Jensen, the family's second daughter died at two years of age in 1855, four years before Bertha was born. When she was 11 the family moved from Vienna's Leopoldstadt, which was primarily inhabited by poverty-ridden Jews, to Liechtensteinstraße in the Alsergrund. She left school when she was sixteen, devoted herself to needlework and helped her mother with the kosher preparation of their food. Her 18-month-younger brother Wilhelm (1860–1937) was meanwhile attending a high school, which made Bertha intensely jealous.Jensen (1984), Streifzüge, p. 21.  Illness  Between 1880 and 1882 Bertha Pappenheim was treated by Austrian physician Josef Breuer for a variety of nervous symptoms that appeared when her father suddenly became ill. Breuer kept his then-friend Sigmund Freud abreast of her case, informing his earliest analysis of the origins of hysteria. On this subject they published Studies on Hysteria in 1895.  Frankfurt  In November 1888, when she was twenty-nine and after her convalescence, she and her mother moved to Frankfurt am Main. Their family environment was partially Orthodox and partly liberal. In contrast to their life in Vienna they became involved in art and science, and not only in charitable work. The Goldschmidt and Oppenheim families were well known as collectors and patrons of the arts and lent their support to scientific and academic projects, particularly during the founding of Frankfurt University.For example, the Katharina und Moritz Oppenheimsche Stiftung established a chair of theoretical physics at Frankfurt University, and Marcus M. Goldschmidt was a member and patron of the Senckenbergische Naturforschende Gesellschaft. In this environment, Bertha Pappenheim intensified her literary efforts (her publications began in 1888 and were initially anonymous; they later appeared under the pseudonym \\"P. Berthold\\") and became involved in social and political activities. She first worked in a soup kitchen and read aloud in an orphanage for Jewish girls run by the Israelitischer Frauenverein (Israelite Women's Association). In 1895 she was temporarily in charge of the orphanage, and one year later became its official director. During the following 12 years she was able to orient the educational program away from the one and only goal of subsequent marriage, to training with a view to vocational independence. In 1895, a plenary meeting of the Allgemeiner Deutscher Frauenverein (ADF) (General German Women's Association) took place in Frankfurt. Pappenheim was a participant and later contributed to the establishment of a local ADF group. In the following years she began — first of all in the journal Ethische Kultur (Ethical Culture) — to publish articles on the subject of women's rights. She also translated Mary Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Woman.  Jüdischer Frauenbund  At the first German conference on combating traffic in women held in Frankfurt in October 1902, Bertha Pappenheim and Sara Rabinowitsch were asked to travel to Galicia to investigate the social situation there. In her 1904 report about this trip, which lasted several months, she described the problems that arose from a combination of agrarian backwardness and early industrialization as well as from the collision of Hasidism and Zionism. At a meeting of the International Council of Women held in 1904 in Berlin, it was decided to found a national Jewish women's association. Similar to the Bund Deutscher Frauenverein (BDF) (Federation of German Women's Associations) co- founded by Helene Lange in 1894, the intent was to unite the social and emancipatory efforts of Jewish women's associations. Bertha Pappenheim was elected the first president of the Jüdischer Frauenbund, JFB (League of Jewish Women) and was its head for 20 years, contributing to its efforts until her death in 1936. The JFB joined the BDF in 1907. Between 1914 and 1924 Pappenheim was on the board of the BDF. On the one hand the goals of the JFB were feminist — strengthening women's rights and advancing the gainful employment of Jewish women, and on the other hand they were in accordance with the traditional goals of Jewish philanthropy — practical charity, as a divine precept. Integrating these different objectives was not always easy for Pappenheim. A particular objection was that in her battle against traffic in women she not only spoke openly about Jewish women as victims, but also about Jewish men as perpetrators. She criticized how women were perceived in Judaism, and as a member of the German feminist movement she demanded that the ideal of equal rights for women be realized also within Jewish institutions. She was particularly concerned about education and job equality. A statement she made at the first JFB delegate assembly in 1907 - \\"under Jewish law a woman is not an individual, not a personality; she is only judged and assessed as a sexual being\\"Pappenheim, \\"Zur Sittlichkeitsfrage.\\" In: Helga Heubach (ed.), Sisyphus: Gegen den Mädchenhandel – Galizien. Freiburg im Breisgau: Kore, 1992. p. 112. Original German: \\"vor dem jüdischen Gesetz ist die Frau kein Individuum, keine Persönlichkeit, nur als Gattin und Mutter wird sie gewertet und beurteilt.\\" - prompted a violent nationwide reaction on the part of Orthodox rabbis and the Jewish press. The existence of the conditions Pappenheim criticized — traffic in women, neglect of illegitimate Jewish orphans — was denied, and she was accused of \\"insulting Judaism.\\" Also, politically liberal and emancipated Jews had a patriarchal and traditional attitude about women's rights. Meanwhile, the JFB grew steadily and in 1907 had 32,000 members in 82 associations. For a time the JFB was the largest charitable Jewish organization with over 50,000 members. In 1917 Bertha Pappenheim called for \\"an end to the splintering of Jewish welfare work,\\" which helped lead to the founding of the Zentralwohlfahrtsstelle der Juden in Deutschland (Central Welfare Agency of German Jewry), which continues to exist today. Her work on its board was supported by Sidonie Werner. After the Nazis assumed power in 1933 Pappenheim again took over the presidency of the JFB, but resigned in 1934 because she could not abandon her negative attitude to Zionism, despite the existential threat for Jews in Germany, while in the JFP, as among German Jews in general, Zionism was increasingly endorsed after 1933. Especially her attitude toward the immigration of young people to Israel (Youth Aliya) was controversial. She rejected the emigration of children and youths to Palestine while their parents remained in Germany. However, she herself brought a group of orphanage children safely to Great Britain in 1934. After the antisemitic Nuremberg Laws were passed on 15 September 1935, she changed her mind and argued in favor of the emigration of the Jewish population. After Pappenheim died her JFB positions were partially taken over by Hannah Karminski. In 1939 the League of Jewish Women was disbanded by the Nazis.  Neu-Isenburg  Bertha Pappenheim was the founder - or initiator - of many institutions, including kindergartens, community homes and educational institutions. She considered her life's work to be the Neu-Isenburg orphanage for Jewish girls (Mädchenwohnheim Neu-Isenburg). After she gave a speech at the Israelitischer Hilfsverein (Israelite Women's Aid Association) in 1901, a women's group was formed with the goal of coordinating and professionalizing the work of various social initiatives and projects. This group was first a part of the Israelitischer Hilfsverein, but in 1904 became an independent organization, Weibliche Fürsorge (Women's Relief).... Starting around 1906 Pappenheim devoted herself to the goal of founding a refuge to help illegitimate girls and/or Jewish women endangered by prostitution and traffic in women, where she could implement the theories she had developed on Jewish social work. This home was to be operated on the following principles: * In contrast to traditional Jewish charities, modern social work should be undertaken, focusing mainly on education and training for an independent life. * In accord with the principle of \\"follow-up aid,\\" former home inhabitants' progress through life was to be monitored for an extended period to avert renewed negligence. * The home should not be \\"an establishment caring for juveniles in the legal sense, no monument in stone to some foundation, with inscriptions, votive tablets, corridors, dormitories and dining halls, an elementary school, a detention room and cells, and a dominating director's family, but rather a home, although it can be only a surrogate for the proper raising of children in their own families, which was preferable.\\"Pappenheim, Bertha. Aus der Arbeit des Heims des Jüdischen Frauenbundes in Isenburg 1914–1924. p. 8. * The residents should become involved in Jewish tradition and culture. * The home should be kept simple, so that the residents become familiar with the realities and requirements of a lower middle class household. Louise Goldschmidt, a relative of Pappenheim's mother, made available a pair of semi-detached houses where a girl's home could be established in Neu-Isenburg near Frankfurt am Main with all its clinics and social institutions. In contrast to Prussian Frankfurt, Hessian Neu-Isenburg's less rigid laws also had advantages for stateless persons. Thanks to donations amounting to 19,000 marks to furnish the house, it could begin operations on 25 November 1907 with the goal of providing \\"protection for those needing protection and education for those needing education.\\"Pappenheim, Aus der Arbeit, p. 5. The facility was plain, and was sometimes criticized for being excessively so. There was, for example, no running water in the bathrooms, and central heating was only added in 1920. But the facilities did make it possible to strictly adhere to Jewish dietary and purity requirements, (kashruth, kosher). In the basement a passover kitchen was even available, although it was required only once a year. Art in the house and the garden was to serve to educate the residents. Examples are the children's fountain, Der vertriebene Storch (The Expelled Stork), designed by Fritz J. Kormis to illustrate a tale by Pappenheim, lecture series, modest theater performances, and speeches, among others by Martin Buber, a friend of Pappenheim and a guest on several occasions. The number of residents was initially low, but grew in the course of time from 10 in 1908 to 152 in 1928. The property and existing buildings were expanded with purchases and donations and adapted to meet increasing requirements, and additional buildings were constructed. In the end, the home consisted of four buildings, including one for pregnant women and those who had just given birth — the delivery itself took place in a Frankfurt clinic — and an isolation ward. The home's school-aged children attended the Neu-Isenburg elementary school. There was extensive medical care for the residents, and - at regular intervals - psychiatric examinations. Pappenheim rejected psychoanalytic treatment for the residents. Although she never experienced proper psychoanalytic therapy herself, undergoing only an unfinished hypnotic treatment by Josef Breuer, Pappenheim only spoke once about psychoanalysis in general: \\"Psychoanalysis is in the hands of a doctor, what confession is in the hands of a Catholic priest; whether it becomes a good instrument or a double edged sword depends on who is administering it, and on the treatment.\\". Cited in: Loentz, Elizabeth (2007). Let Me Continue to Speak the Truth: Bertha Pappenheim as Author and Activist. Cincinnati: Hebrew Union College Press. p. 219. Since the ongoing financing of the home was preferably not to depend on rich individual patrons, an association, the Heim des jüdischen Frauenbundes e.V. (Home of the Jewish Women's Association), was established to act as its sponsor and owner. Membership fees of 3 marks per year were supposed to put the covering of running expenses on a broad basis. Appreciation for her Neu-Isenburg work was not at first forthcoming for Bertha Pappenheim. Orthodox Jewish circles considered the founding of the home to be a scandal, and its existence a tacit toleration of prostitution and immorality. In order to reintegrate into the Jewish community single mothers, young prostitutes and their children, who in most cases had been disowned by their families, the home attempted to motivate families to resume relations with them, and known fathers to marry the mothers of their children, or pay alimony.  Final years and death  After her mother died in 1905 Bertha Pappenheim lived alone for many years without a private attachment. \\"Mir ward die Liebe nicht\\" (\\"Love did not come to me\\"), she lamented in a poem dated 1911. In May 1923, she was one of the principal speakers at the First World Congress of Jewish Women in Vienna, where she spoke on the need to protect Jewish girls and women from trafficking and prostitution. In 1924 a close friendship began with Hannah Karminski, a woman 40 years her junior, when Hannah took over the leadership of the Jüdischer Mädchenclub (Jewish Girl's Club). Both women spent their free time together as much as possible. When in 1925 Karminski moved for a time to Berlin, they wrote to each other almost daily. While on a trip in Austria in 1935, she donated two of her collections (lace and small cast iron objects) to the Museum of Applied Arts in Vienna.Seminar- und Gedenkstätte Bertha Pappenheim. \\"Schenkung Bertha Pappenheim Seminar- und Gedenkstätte: Thora-Zeiger im Andenken an Anni Salinger\\" [press release] (January 13, 2012). Retrieved from http://neu- isenburg.de/buergerservice/rathauspresse/archiv-pressemitteilungen/ 2015-08-28. The collections were initially permanent loans of the Siegmund- und Recha-Pappenheim Stiftung, and later came into the possession of the museum as donations. From Vienna she traveled on to Ischl. While traveling, her general condition deteriorated and she was taken to the Israelite Hospital in Munich. During an operation which took place there it was determined that she had a malignant tumor. Despite her illness she traveled, at the end of 1935, to Amsterdam in order to meet Henrietta Szold, the head of Youth Aliyah, and again to Galicia, to advise the Beth Jacob Schools. After returning to Frankfurt her suffering increased and she became bedridden. She also had jaundice. During her last few days of life, she was summoned for questioning by the state police station in Offenbach, the reason being denunciation by an employee of the home. A girl with an intellectual disability had made what was considered by the police to be a derogatory comment about Adolf Hitler. Pappenheim refused to appear at the hearing because of poor health. After the hearing on 16 April 1936, for which she calmly but firmly supplied information regarding the accusation, no further steps were taken on the part of the police.Leitner, Thea (1998). Fürstin, Dame, Armes Weib. Ungewöhnliche Frauen im Wien der Jahrhundertwende. Vienna: Ueberreuter. p. 349. She died on 28 May 1936, cared for until the end by her friend Hannah Karminski, and was buried next to her mother in the Rat Beil Strasse Jewish cemetery in Frankfurt. After the death of Bertha Pappenheim, the work in Neu-Isenburg could continue essentially unhindered until the 1936 Olympic Games. In 1937, the children residing in the home were no longer allowed to attend the Neu-Isenburg elementary school and had to be transported daily to the Jewish school in Frankfurt.Based on the Gesetz gegen die Überfüllung deutscher Schulen und Hochschulen (law against overcrowding in German schools and universities) of 25 April 1933. In 1938 the Isenburg branch of the NSDAP instigated the closure of the home. On 10 November 1938, one day after the November Pogrom (Reichskristallnacht), the home was attacked. The main building was set afire and burned down, and the other buildings were wrecked. On 31 March 1942 the home was disbanded by the Gestapo. The remaining residents were deported to the concentration camp in Theresienstadt, where many died. On 9 December 1942 Hannah Karminski was brought to the extermination camp in Auschwitz-Birkenau where she was murdered on 4 June 1943.  Literary works   Stories, plays, poetry  Bertha Pappenheim published her first works anonymously, and later under a pseudonym, \\"Paul Berthold,\\" still a common practice among female writers of that time. She derived the pseudonym by modifying her own name: „Berth(a) Pappenheim“ became „P(aul) Berth(old).“Jensen (1984), Streifzüge, p. 43 f. Starting in 1902 she published novellas and plays under her own name. Kleine Geschichten für Kinder (Little Stories for Children) appeared anonymously in 1888, to be followed in 1890 by a volume of tales, In der Trödelbude (In the Junk Shop). The nine novella in this volume have as their subject in each case a defective or otherwise useless item, such as a piece of lace, a music box, or a coffee pot. In 1913 she published the play Tragische Momente. Drei Lebensbilder (Tragic Moments. Three Scenes from Life). The scenes correspond to three episodes in the life of a Jewish couple. In the first scene the young couple experiences the atrocities of the Russian pogroms of 1904 and flees to Frankfurt. In the second scene, as Russian Jews they are not accepted in the community. A Jewish innkeeper wants to employ the woman as a hostess and the man as a trickster. When they turn down his offer, he denounces them as political criminals and they flee to Palestine. The third scene shows the man as a widower waiting for his son to return from Europe. When the son confesses that he cannot imagine a life as a farmer in Palestine, his father commits suicide. Pappenheim refused to have the play performed at a JFP assembly of delegates in 1933, \\"since the 'Tragic Moments', which I wrote without an ulterior motive, would certainly give rise to objections in Zionist circles because of their timeliness.\\" She advised against \\"scattering explosives among the women.\\"Bertha Pappenheim to Frau Clem Cramer, dated Isenburg, January 1933. Stadtarchiv Frankfurt (Frankfurt Municipal Archive). Among the lost texts were apparently two other plays mentioned in this letter. Their titles are Ostern (\\"Easter\\") and Das Gesindel (\\"The Rabble\\"). In addition she wrote numerous texts unpublished during her lifetime. Most are lost and what remains is scattered. Among the scattered texts are the so- called Denkzettel (\\"Memoranda\\"), short maxims and sayings, some of which are dated and some of which she later had her secretary Lucy Jourdan collect and copy.Jensen (1984), Streifzüge, p. 179–195. An example: \\"Whoever foregoes his freedom without an urgent necessity does not deserve it.\\" These texts also include the prayers which were published by the League of Jewish Women shortly after Pappenheim's death. These are not prayers in the sense of traditional Judaism, but personal poems addressed to God. One of Pappenheim's poems written in the period 1910–1912:Stadtarchiv Frankfurt. Nachlass Dora Edinger. Blatt II. (Frankfurt Municipal Archive. Estate of Dora Edinger. Sheet II). Love did not come to me - So I vegetate like a plant, In a cellar, without light. Love did not come to me - So I resound like a violin, Whose bow has been broken. Love did not come to me - So I immerse myself in work, Living myself sore from duty. Love did not come to me - So I gladly think of death, As a friendly face.  Translations  One of her first productions was a translation of Mary Wollstonecraft's programmatic paper in English on the women's rights movement. It appeared in 1899 under the title Mary Wollstonecraft – Eine Verteidigung der Rechte der Frau (Mary Wollstonecraft — in defense of women's rights). Starting in 1910 she translated several Yiddish texts into German: * The memoirs of Glikl bas Judah Leib (also known as Glückel of Hameln), one of Pappenheim's ancestors (1910) * The Ma'assebuch, also known as the \\"Women's Talmud,\\" a collection of stories from the Talmud and the Midrash (1929) and * Parts of Ze'enah u-Re'enah, the so-called \\"Women's Bible.\\" Bertha Pappenheim as Glikl bas Judah Leib Only the first part of her translation of the Women's Bible appeared (Bereschit, correspondending to the First Book of Moses). The translations of the Second and Third Books (Schemot and Wajikra) have apparently been lost. Bertha Pappenheim dealt exclusively with texts written by women or for women. The Ma'assebuch and the Women's Bible were the most widely distributed works of Yiddish \\"women's literature.\\" As to the purpose of her translations, she wrote in the foreword to the memoirs of Glikl: > Putting the text into modern language and punctuation has the purpose of > reanimating the image of a woman who, deeply rooted in her times, stands out > because of her unusual intellectual gifts, and is true to her faith, true to > her people, true to her family, and true to herself.Memoiren der Glückel von > Hameln (2005). Weinheim: Beltz. p. IX. And in the foreword to the Ma'assebuch she wrote: > In the hands of parents, educators and teachers the Allerlei Geschichten > (All Kinds of Stories) can be a bridge to a new understanding of the meaning > of traditional Jewish culture and beliefs. Together with her brother Wilhelm and Stefan Meyer, a relative, she found out while researching her family tree that she was distantly related to Glikl. She also had Leopold Pilichowski (1869–1933) make a portrait of her as Glikl.  Articles and information pamphlets  German postage stamp (1954) in the series \\"Benefactors of Mankind\\" The focus of her writings, however, was to provide information especially about the social situation of Jewish refugees and traffic in women. In 1924 she published her most well-known book, Sisyphus-Arbeit (Sisyphean Labor), a study on traffic in women and prostitution in Eastern Europe and the Orient.  Recognition  In 1954 a German postage stamp with a portrait of Bertha Pappenheim was issued in the series \\"Benefactors of Mankind\\" in recognition of her services. On the 50th anniversary of her death, a conference was held on various aspects of her life. On the former site of the Neu Isenburg home for endangered girls and unwed mothers, a seminar room and memorial to Bertha Pappenheim were inaugurated in 1997.Brentzel, Marianna (2014).

Two of the major mines of Ethiopia are located near Shakiso: the Lega Dembi gold and the Kenticha tantalum mines.\\"Tantalum Mineral Resource\\" Ministry of Mines and Energy of Ethiopia website (accessed 12 January 2009) The Lega Dembi mine was acquired by MIDROC gold, which between 1998 and 2008 extracted 34 metric tons from the mines, earning 466 million dollars. However, MIDROC has announced in 2009 that the deposits at Lega Dembi are almost exhausted.Minassie Teshome, \\"Ethiopia: Midroc Signs Up for Second Gold Mine\\", Addis Fortune 29 November 2009 (accessed 29 April 2010) Shakiso is served by an airport (ICAO code HASK, IATA SKR).

There were two substantial waterholes there, although the water was somewhat salty. The customs staff had four small buildings on the top of a hill near the main road. Their primary task was to collect salt tax from caravans, which amounted to ten or eleven Maria Theresa Thalers per month before the Second Italian-Abyssinian War.\\"Local History in Ethiopia\\" (pdf) The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 27 November 2007) Following the savage suppression of their revolt in 1960, numerous members of the Gedeo people were forcibly evicted from their homes, and over the following years some migrated to Shakiso to settle.

It is estimated to be worth up to £160 million or $208 million in today's money. History Spain had controlled Lima since the 16th century, when it defeated the Incas. In the centuries that followed, the Roman Catholic Church gathered a huge treasure in Lima. In the early 19th century, Spain began to have difficulties with its colonies due to wars of independence in South America. Lima was no exception, and in 1820 the city came under heavy pressure and finally had to be evacuated. (See also Peruvian War of Independence.) In 1820, Lima was on the edge of revolt. As a preventative measure, the Viceroy of Lima decided to transport the city's fabulous wealth to Mexico for safekeeping. The treasures included jeweled stones, candlesticks, and two life-size solid gold statues of Mary holding the baby Jesus. In all, the treasure was valued at between $12 million and $60 million. Captain William Thompson, commander of the Mary Dear, was put in charge of transporting the riches to Mexico. Thompson and his crew proved to be unable to resist the temptation; they turned pirate, cut the throats of the guards and accompanying priests, and threw their bodies overboard. Thompson headed for Cocos Island, off the coast of present-day Costa Rica, where he and his men allegedly buried the treasure. They then decided to split up and lay low until the situation had calmed down, at which time they would reconvene to divvy up the spoils. However, the Mary Dear was captured, and the crew went on trial for piracy. All but Thompson and his first mate James Alexander Forbes were hanged. To save their lives, the two agreed to lead the Spanish to the stolen treasure. They took them as far as the Cocos Islands and then managed to escape into the jungle. Thompson, the first mate, and the treasure were never seen again, though it is believed that Thompson returned to Newfoundland with the aid of a whaling ship. Forbes settled in California, became a successful businessman, but never returned to the island. Treasure hunting Since that time, hundreds of treasure hunters have travelled to Cocos Island and tried to find the Treasure of Lima, sometimes also referred to as the Loot of Lima, or the Cocos Island Treasure. One of the most notable was the German August Gissler, who lived on the island from 1889 to 1908. Another was the American gangster Bugsy Seigel. None have succeeded in finding the treasure. One theory is that the treasure was not buried on the Cocos Islands at all, but on an unknown island off the coast of Central America. The Costa Rican government does not allow treasure hunting here any longer and believes no treasure exists on this island.  Treasure of Lima: A Buried Exhibition  An art project called Treasure of Lima: A Buried Exhibition took place on Cocos Island in May 2014. A container with artwork by 40 different artists was buried in a secret location, with the coordinates auctioned off.

Some accounts say that when Gungsong Gungtsen reached the age of thirteen (twelve by Western reckoning), his father, Songtsen Gampo, retired and he then ruled the country for five years (which could have been the period when Songtsen Gampo was working on the constitution). Gungsong Gungtsen also married 'A-zha Mang-mo-rje when he was thirteen and they had a son, Mangsong Mangtsen (r. 650-676 CE). Gungsong Gungtsen is said to have only ruled for five years when he died at eighteen. His father, Songtsen Gampo, took the throne again.Shakabpa, Tsepon W. D. (1967).

Lightning, together with the other two Palmer-built destroyers, was laid down on 28 March 1894, and was launched on 10 April 1895.Friedman 2009, p. 302. Lightning exceeded the required 27 knots, reaching an average of during sea trials on 5 November 1895.Brassey 1897, p. 321. She collided with a collier on 8 November when returning to port from these trials, damaging her bows, and then ran aground on the Maplin Sands. Staff Commander Bullmore, in command of the ship during the trials, was found guilty of hazarding the ship by negligence and being drunk when on board Lightning in the resultant court martial. He was severely reprimanded and lost five years seniority. Despite these mishaps Lightning completed in January 1896. Service The Palmer- built ships were considered the best of the 27-knotters, and at one stage, both Lightning and Janus were selected for service in distant overseas stations,Lyon 2001, p. 116. although in the end, only Janus was sent to the China station, with Lightning serving her whole career in home waters. Lightning took part in the 1896 British Naval Manoeuvres, attached to the Channel Fleet operation from Berehaven in southern Ireland.Brassey 1897, pp. 141–143, 149. She was based at HMNB Portsmouth as a tender to Excellent in 1900. She underwent repairs to re-tube her boilers in 1902, and was commissioned by Lieutenant Rowland Henry Bather on 1 August 1902. She again had her boilers retubed at Sheerness in 1907, after which she returned to Portsmouth. On 17 February 1908 Lightning rammed a mooring buoy in Portsmouth harbour, holing her bow. In 1910, Lightning was part of the Sixth Destroyer Flotilla, based at The Nore, still being based at the Nore in 1912. On 25 April 1912 Lightning collided with the torpedo boat in Stangate Creek. Both ships were damaged, and required docking for repair, with Lightnings bow damaged and TB 17 holed below the waterline. On 30 August 1912 the Admiralty directed all destroyers were to be grouped into classes designated by letters based on contract speed and appearance.

Lightning, assigned the pennant number N.23, was allocated to the Nore Local Defence Flotilla by January 1915. On 30 June 1915, following the sighting of floating mines near the Kentish Knock Lightvessel, Lightning and the destroyer were sent out to deal with the mines. The two ships had destroyed three mines before Lightning struck another mine, lain by the German submarine , killing 15 of her crew. Lightning broke in half, the bow section sinking, while the stern was towed back to Sheerness and later scrapped.

After graduating from the University of Southern California Medical School in 1916 and completing her internship and residency in Illinois, she established one of the first Western medical clinics in San Francisco's Chinatown in the early 1920s. Early life Chung was born in Santa Barbara, the eldest of eleven children. Her father was the foreman of the Rancho Guadalasca in Ventura County, but the family moved to Los Angeles by 1902. Chung's parents became sick, and she supported the family and helped to raise her younger siblings from when she was ten. In 1905, Chung was noted in the Los Angeles Herald as a promising student and for her planned future career as a newspaper reporter. She was noted in the Herald again in 1906 for her poem \\"Missionary Giving,\\" delivered at the eighteenth anniversary of the Los Angeles Congregational Chinese mission. Chung would write and deliver a paper entitled \\"Comparisons of Chinese and American Costumes\\" at the first anniversary of the Pasadena Congregational mission in 1907. By that fall, Chung had graduated from the eighth grade at the Seventh Street School and enrolled in the preparatory school at USC, being hailed as a \\"bright particular star\\" of the women's gymnasium class. In 1910, Chung won second place in a speech contest. Chung won a Los Angeles Times scholarship to study at USC by selling newspaper subscriptions and worked her way through college as a waitress, a seller of surgical instruments, and by winning cash prizes in several speech contests. In 1909, Chung graduated from USC. Chung enrolled in the medical school in 1911, according to a 1914 profile that noted her belief that she was \\"the first Chinese girl to enter a medical school in this state.\\" Professional career Dr. Chung with a Lockheed P-38 Lightning model and photos of some of her recruits After graduating with a medical degree in 1916, she was initially denied positions as either a medical missionary to China or an internship and settled for work as a surgical nurse in Los Angeles, at the Santa Fe Railroad Hospital. After several months, she left for Chicago, interning at the Mary Thompson Women's and Children's Hospital before serving her residency at the nearby Kankakee State Hospital. Chung would serve as the resident assistant in psychiatry for the first Juvenile Psychopathic Institute of the State of Illinois at the Cook County Hospital in 1917; she was later appointed state criminologist for Illinois. After two years in Illinois, Chung resigned from her position with Cook County in November 1918 and returned to Los Angeles following her father's death, accepting a position as a surgeon at Santa Fe Railroad Hospital, where she would go on to treat celebrities, including removing Mary Pickford's tonsils. Chung moved to San Francisco's Chinatown in 1922, where she treated the local Chinese American population as well as celebrities such as Sophie Tucker, Helen Hayes, and Tallulah Bankhead. She also treated seven Navy reserve pilots during this time; part of her care was making them meals, and they reportedly soon began calling themselves \\"Mom Chung's Fair-Haired Bastard Sons\\" as a tribute to her. An alternative origin story for the \\"Mom Chung\\" nickname is that after eight pilots came to her in 1932, volunteering their services for China against Japan, she turned them down and fed them instead because \\"they looked starved\\". The pilots \\"ate everything she gave them, except eggs\\" because when they were destitute, the only vendor who would lend the pilots food on credit was an egg farmer. Prior to the United States entry into World War II, Chung would give her \\"adopted son\\" pilots a jade Buddha to wear around their necks, which would become a token by which the pilots would recognize each other throughout the world. Non-aviation naval officers \\"adopted\\" by Chung were called \\"Golden Dolphins.\\" When Japan invaded China in 1937, Chung volunteered as a front-line surgeon, but she was secretly assigned instead to recruit pilots for the 1st American Volunteer Group, better known as the \\"Flying Tigers.\\" During the war, Chung would serve up to 175 people at Thanksgiving at her house and wrapped and addressed 4,000 gifts at Christmas. Her houseguests included high ranking officers and US senators and congressmen; leaning on these connections, she helped establish the Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service although she was not permitted to join them, as the government suspected that she was gay. Mom Chung adopted the entire VF-2 squadron, nicknamed \\"The Rippers\\" for their logo, which showed a Chinese dragon ripping a flag. VF-2 was assigned to and would set an American record by shooting down 67 Japanese planes in a single day during the Great Marianas Turkey Shoot in June 1944. In 1947, 90% of Chung's medical patients were white. She retired from medical practice within ten years after the end of World War II, and her \\"adopted sons\\" purchased a house for her in Marin County. Death TBM \\"Mom Chung\\" on May 30, 2013 Chung died of cancer in January 1959 at Franklin Hospital in San Francisco. Among her pallbearers was Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, one of her \\"Golden Dolphins.\\" Personal relationships A pioneer in both professional and political realms, Chung led an unconventional personal life. As the only woman in her class, she adopted masculine dress and called herself \\"Mike,\\" but after having established a professional practice she reverted to conventional dress and her female name. Based on personal correspondence, she had close and apparently intense relationships with at least two other women, the writer Elsa Gidlow and entertainer Sophie Tucker, that some writers have speculated were romantic. Although she was briefly engaged, she never did marry. An advocate of strong Sino-American relations, Chung was a neighbor, friend and confidante of travel writer Richard Halliburton (1900–1939), who died in an attempt to sail the junk Sea Dragon, as a symbol of the bond of East and West, from Hong Kong to the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco. Military \\"sons\\" Some of the notable \\"sons\\" of \\"Mom\\" Chung included: * Albert B. Chandler, Sr. (no. 98), Governor and U.S. Senator from Kentucky * William F. \\"Bull\\" Halsey (no. 600), Fleet Admiral of the United States Navy * Andre Kostelanetz (no. 434), conductor * Melvin Maas (no. 447), Major General of the United States Marine Corps and U.S. Representative from Minnesota * Chester W. Nimitz (no. 100), Fleet Admiral of the United States Navy * William Sterling Parsons, Rear Admiral and bomb commander of Enola Gay * Russell Randall, Brigadier General of the United States Army Air Forces * Ronald Reagan (no. 131), actor and President * Raymond E. Willis (no. 124), U.S. Senator from Indiana  Commemorations  Chung reportedly served as inspiration for the character of Dr. Mary Ling in the 1939 film King of Chinatown, portrayed by Anna May Wong. At least three Flying Fortresses were named \\"Mama Chung\\" in her honor by her \\"adopted\\" sons during World War II. Chung was commemorated with a plaque in the Legacy Walk project on October 11, 2012, an outdoor public display which celebrates LGBT history and people. A tunnel boring machine for the San Francisco Municipal Railway's Central Subway was named \\"Mom Chung\\" on March 7, 2013. Margaret Chung is featured in a mural by Maren Conrad commemorating 100 years of the 19th amendment. It is located in Sacramento, California.

On 3 June 1969, the two ships were participating in SEATO exercise Sea Spirit in the South China Sea. Around 3:00 am, when ordered to a new escort station, Evans sailed under Melbournes bow, where she was cut in two. Seventy-four of Evans's crew were killed. A joint RAN–USN board of inquiry was held to establish the events of the collision and the responsibility of those involved. This inquiry, which was believed by the Australians to be biased against them, found that both ships were at fault for the collision. Four officers (the captains of Melbourne and Evans, plus the two junior officers in control of Evans at the time of the collision) were court-martialled based on the results of the inquiry; while the three USN officers were found guilty, the RAN officer was cleared of wrongdoing. Ships HMAS Melbourne was the lead ship of the Majestic class of aircraft carriers. She was laid down for the Royal Navy on 15 April 1943, but construction was stopped at the end of World War II. She was sold to the Royal Australian Navy in 1948, along with sister ship , but was heavily upgraded while construction was completed and did not enter service until the end of 1955. In 1964, Melbourne was involved in a collision with the Australian destroyer , sinking the smaller ship and killing 81 of her crew and one civilian dockyard worker. USS Frank E. Evans was an . She was laid down on 21 April 1944, and commissioned into the United States Navy on 3 February 1945.Naval History Department, History of USS Frank E. Evans (DD-754). She served in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War, and earned 11 battle stars.

Evans (DD-754) at sea, April 1963.jpgUSS Frank E. Evans Lead up Melbournes commanding officer during the SEATO exercise was Captain John Phillip Stevenson.Frame, Pacific Partners, p. 126. Rear Admiral John Crabb, the Flag Officer Commanding Australian Fleet, was also embarked on the carrier. During Sea Spirit, Melbourne was assigned five escorts: the US destroyers , and , and the frigates HMNZS Blackpool and . Stevenson held a dinner for the five escort captains at the start of the exercise, during which he recounted the events of the Melbourne–Voyager collision, emphasised the need for caution when operating near the carrier, and provided written instructions on how to avoid such a situation developing again.Hall, HMAS Melbourne, p. 175. Additionally, during the lead-up to the exercise, Admiral Crabb had strongly warned that all repositioning manoeuvres performed by the escorts had to commence with a turn away from Melbourne. Despite these warnings, a near-miss occurred in the early hours of 31 May when Larson turned toward the carrier after being ordered to the plane guard station.Hall, HMAS Melbourne, p. 176. Subsequent action narrowly prevented a collision. The escorts were again warned about the dangers of operating near the carrier and informed of Stevenson's expectations, while the minimum distance between carrier and escorts was increased from . Collision On the night of 2–3 June, Melbourne and her escorts were involved in anti-submarine training exercises.Hills, Muddied Waters In preparation for launching a Grumman S-2 Tracker aircraft, Stevenson ordered Evans to the plane guard station, reminded the destroyer of Melbournes course, and instructed the carrier's navigational lights to be brought to full brilliance.Smith & Lancaster, USS Frank E. Evans, p. 1. This was the fourth time that Evans had been asked to assume this station that night, and the previous three manoeuvres had been without incident. Evans was positioned on Melbournes port bow, but began the manoeuvre by turning starboard, towards the carrier. A radio message was sent from Melbourne to Evanss bridge and Combat Information Centre, warning the destroyer that she was on a collision course, which Evans acknowledged.Hall, HMAS Melbourne, p. 178. Seeing the destroyer take no action and on a course to place herself under Melbournes bow, Stevenson ordered the carrier hard to port, signalling the turn by both radio and siren blasts. At approximately the same time, Evans turned hard to starboard to avoid the approaching carrier.Sherbo, Death of a Destroyer. It is uncertain which ship began to manoeuvre first, but each ship's bridge crew claimed that they were informed of the other ship's turn after they commenced their own. After having narrowly passed in front of Melbourne, the turns quickly placed Evans back in the carrier's path. Melbourne hit Evans amidships at 3:15 am, cutting the destroyer in two.Frame, Pacific Partners, p. 127. The paths taken by HMAS Melbourne and USS Frank E. Evans in the minutes leading up to the collision Melbourne stopped immediately after the collision and deployed her boats, liferafts and lifebuoys, before carefully manoeuvring alongside the stern section of Evans.Hall, HMAS Melbourne, pp. 178, 184. Sailors from both ships used mooring lines to lash the two ships together, allowing Melbourne to evacuate the survivors in that section.Hall, HMAS Melbourne, p. 184. The bow section sank quickly; the majority of those killed were believed to have been trapped within. Members of Melbournes crew dived into the water to rescue overboard survivors close to the carrier, while the carrier's boats and helicopters collected those farther out.Hall, HMAS Melbourne, pp. 183–184. Clothing, blankets and beer were provided to survivors from the carrier's stores, some RAN sailors offered their own uniforms, and the ship's band was instructed to set up on the flight deck to entertain and distract the USN personnel.Smith & Lancaster, USS Frank E. Evans, p. 2. All of the survivors were located within 12 minutes of the collision and rescued before half an hour had passed, although the search continued for 15 more hours.Hall, HMAS Melbourne, pp. 182, 184. Seventy-four of the 273 crew on Evans were killed. It was later learned that Evanss commanding officer—Commander Albert S. McLemore—was asleep in his quarters at the time of the incident, and charge of the vessel was held by Lieutenants Ronald Ramsey and James Hopson; the former had failed the qualification exam to stand watch, while the latter was at sea for the first time.Hall, HMAS Melbourne, p. 200. Post-collision events Following the evacuation of Evanss stern, the section was cast off while the carrier moved away to avoid damage, but against expectation, it failed to sink.Hall, HMAS Melbourne, p. 185. The stern was recovered and towed by fleet tug to Subic Bay, arriving there on 9 June. After being stripped for parts, the hulk was decommissioned on 1 July, and was later sunk when used for target practice. Melbourne travelled to Singapore, arriving on 6 June, where she received temporary repairs to her bow.Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 312. The carrier departed on 27 June, and arrived in Sydney on 9 July, where she remained until November docked at Cockatoo Island Dockyard for repairs and installation of the new bow. 817 Squadron RAN—which was responsible for the Westland Wessex helicopters embarked on Melbourne at the time of the collision—later received a USN Meritorious Unit Commendation for its rescue efforts. Five other decorations were presented to Australian personnel in relation to the rescue of Evanss crew: one George Medal, one Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE), one Air Force Cross, and two British Empire Medals.Hall, HMAS Melbourne, pp. 191–192. Fifteen additional commendations for gallantry were awarded by the Australian Naval Board. Joint board of inquiry A joint RAN–USN board of inquiry was established to investigate the incident, following the passing of special regulations allowing the presence of Australian personnel at a U.S. inquiry. The board was in session for over 100 hours between 9 June and 14 July, with 79 witnesses interviewed: 48 USN, 28 RAN, and three from other navies.Stevenson, In The Wake, pp. 68, 167–168. The board was made up of six officers. The RAN representatives were Rear Admiral David Stevenson (no relation to Melbournes Captain Stevenson), Captain Ken Shards, and Captain John Davidson.Jo Stevenson, In The Wake, p. 56. The USN officers were Captains S. L. Rusk and C. B. Anderson. Presiding over the board was USN Rear Admiral Jerome King: considered to be an unwise posting as he was the commanding officer of both the forces involved in the SEATO exercise and the fleet unit Evans normally belonged to, and was seen during the inquiry to be biased against Captain Stevenson and other RAN personnel.Cooper, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 203. King's attitude, performance, and conflict of interest were criticised by the Australians present at the inquiry and the press, and his handling of the inquiry was seen as detrimental to relations between the two countries.Frame, Pacific Partners, pp. 127–128. Despite admissions by members of the USN, given privately to personnel in other navies, that the incident was entirely the fault of Evans, significant attempts were made to reduce the U.S. destroyer's culpability and place at least partial blame for the incident on Melbourne.Frame, Pacific Partners, p. 128. At the beginning of the inquiry, King banned one of the RAN legal advisers from attending, even as an observer.Stevenson, In The Wake, p. 71. He regularly intervened for American witnesses, but failed to do so on similar matters for the Australians.Stevenson, In The Wake, p. 85. Testimony on the collision and the subsequent rescue operation was to be given separately, and although requests by American personnel to give both sets of testimony at the same time in order to return to their duties were regularly granted, the same request made by Stevenson was denied by King.Stevenson, In The Wake, p. 95. Testimony of members of the RAN had to be given under oath, and witnesses faced intense questioning from King, despite the same conditions not applying to USN personnel.Stevenson, In The Wake, p. 163. There was also a heavy focus on the adequacy of Melbournes navigational lighting.Stevenson, In The Wake, p. 136. Mentions of the near miss with Larson were interrupted with the instruction that those details could be recounted at a later time, but the matter was never raised by the board. The unanimous decision of the board was that although Evans was partially at fault for the collision, Melbourne had contributed by not taking evasive action sooner, even though doing this would have been a direct contravention of international sea regulations, which stated that in the lead-up to a collision, the larger ship was required to maintain course and speed.Hall, HMAS Melbourne, p. 204. The report was inconsistent in several areas with the evidence given at the inquiry, including the falsity that Melbournes navigational lights took significant time to come to full brilliance.Stevenson, In The Wake, pp. 196–197. Several facts were also edited out of the transcripts of the inquiry.Stevenson, In The Wake, pp. 200–201. Courts-martial Stevenson Stevenson was informed on 29 July of the result, although not the details, and was told that a court- martial charging him for his role in the incident might be required.Stevenson, In The Wake, p. 174. Two charges of negligence—for failing to explicitly instruct Evans to change course to avoid collision and for failing to set the carrier's engines to full astern—were laid on 15 August, with the court martial held from 20 to 25 August.Hall, HMAS Melbourne, p. 205. Evidence presented during the hearing showed that going full astern would have made no difference to the collision, and on the matter of the failing-to-instruct charge, the presiding Judge Advocate concluded that reasonable warning had been given to the destroyer and asked \\"What was [Stevenson] supposed to do—turn his guns on them?\\". Of the evidence and testimony given at the court- martial, nothing suggested that Stevenson had done anything wrong; instead it was claimed that he had done everything reasonable to avoid collision, and had done it correctly.Stevenson, In The Wake, p. 191. The reasons for the court- martial given by historians vary. One reason suggested was that it was to appease the USN, which had court-martialled three officers from Evans and had threatened to prevent US ships from operating as part of Australian-led forces if no action was taken against Stevenson.Hall, HMAS Melbourne, p. 206. The other view is that the court-martial was used in an attempt to clear Stevenson's name and to allow the RAN to distance itself from the findings of the joint board of inquiry. The defence submitted that there was \\"no case to answer\\", resulting in the dropping of both charges, and the verdict of \\"Honourably Acquitted\\".Frame, Pacific Partners, p. 129. Despite the findings, Stevenson's next posting was as chief of staff to a minor flag officer; seen by him as a demotion in all but name. The posting had been decided upon before the court-martial, and was announced while Stevenson was out of the country for the courts-martial of Evanss officers; he did not learn about it until his return to Australia.Stevenson, In The Wake, pp. 205, 208. Following the events—publicly considered to be another scapegoating of a commanding officer of Melbourne (the first enquiry into the collision between Melbourne and HMAS Voyager had laid significant blame on Captain John Robertson, the ship's commanding officer at the time)—Stevenson requested retirement, as he no longer wished to serve under people he no longer respected.Frame, Pacific Partners, pp. 130–131. This retirement was initially denied, but was later permitted. McLemore, Ramsey and Hopson Commander Albert S. McLemore and Lieutenants Hopson and Ramsey also faced courts-martial for their contributions to the collision. Hopson and Ramsey both pleaded guilty to charges of dereliction of duty and negligence, and had their positions in the promotion list moved down.Frame, No Pleasure Cruise, p. 244. McLemore, who pleaded not guilty to the charges against him, was found guilty of dereliction of duty and negligently hazarding his ship.Frame, Pacific Partners, p. 130. The formal reprimand effectively ended his naval career. In 1999, McLemore publicly claimed that the collision was his responsibility, as he had left two inexperienced officers with the con of his ship.Davis, A rusty hulk is their tombstone. Aftermath A training film, I Relieve You, Sir, was developed by the USN for junior watchkeeping officers. Based on the events of the collision, the film demonstrates the responsibility junior watchkeeping officers hold, and the potential consequences of failing to do their job. Unlike other naval casualties during the Vietnam War, the names of the 74 Evans crew killed are not inscribed on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.Prados, A Forgotten Tragedy. Despite operating in Vietnamese waters immediately before deployment to Exercise Sea Spirit, and being scheduled to return to activities supporting the war effort after the exercise, it was determined that as Sea Spirit was not directly linked with U.S. operations in Vietnam, and the exercise took place outside the geographical limit for the conflict as defined by the outer edge of Market Time operations, the crew was ineligible for inclusion on 'The Wall'. Exceptions to the geographic limit rule have been made for other personnel killed as part of the conflict but not in Vietnam itself; for example those involved in operations in Laos, and those dying in transit to or from Vietnam. However, an act of Congress specifically permitting the inclusion of their names on the memorial is required: legislation to have those killed in the Melbourne–Evans collision has been introduced on several occasions, but has so far failed to gather sufficient support. A memorial to the collision is located in Niobrara, Nebraska. The memorial specifically commemorates the three Sage brothers, all of whom were aboard Evans and were killed in the collision. They were the first group of siblings permitted to serve on the same ship since World War II, a result of the policy introduced when the five Sullivan brothers were killed following the sinking of . Collision survivors and family members of Evans personnel have held annual reunions to memorialise the accident. Australian sailors who served on Melbourne often attend.Branch, Alex, \\"Survivors Recall The Night The USS Frank E. Evans Was Cut in Two\\", Fort Worth Star-Telegram, 29 September 2012. In December 2012, Stevenson announced that his son had received a letter from the Minister for Defence, Stephen Smith, saying that he was \\"not treated fairly\\" by the government of the day and the Australian Navy. It also said, \\"Your father was a distinguished naval officer who served his country with honour in peace and war.\\" \\"Should your father have continued his naval career, the Chief of Navy advises me that he would undoubtedly have been competitive for flag rank.\\"Official apology for HMAS Melbourne captain, Peter Lloyd and Hayden Cooper, Australian Broadcasting Corporation's PM and ABC News Online, 6 December 2012, accessed 7 December 2012. Stevenson also said that he was supported throughout his ordeal by his wife, who had died just five months before the letter arrived. In March 2014, retired RAN officer David Ferry, in writing about the 1964 HMAS Melbourne/HMAS Voyager collision, included a section on related Melbourne/Evans experience and some aspects of its joint board of inquiry. In September 2014 American journalist Louise Esola published American Boys: The True Story of the Lost 74 of the Vietnam War, which chronicles the lives of the 74 men killed on the USS Frank E. Evans and the efforts by survivors and families to have the men memorialized on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C.

It can inform others about what treatment they want or don't want from psychiatrists or other mental health professionals, and it can identify a person to whom they have given the authority to make decisions on their behalf. A mental health advance directive is one kind of advance health care directive. Legal foundations Psychiatric advance directives are legal documents used by persons currently enjoying legal capacity to declare their preferences and instructions for future mental health treatment, or to appoint a surrogate decision maker through Health Care Power of Attorney (HCPA), in advance of being targeted by coercive mental health laws, during which they may be stripped of legal capacity to make decisions.\\"Advance Directives for Mental Health Treatment\\" Debra S. Srebnik and John Q. La Fond Psychiatric Services, Volume 50, Number 7: 919 - 925, July 1999 In the United States, although 25 states have now passed legislation in the past decade establishing authority for PADs, there is relatively little public information available to address growing interest in these legal documents.\\"Law and Psychiatry: Psychiatric Advance Directives and the Treatment of Committed Patients\\" Paul S. Appelbaum, Psychiatric Services, Volume 55, Number 7: 751 - 763, July 2004 In addition in states without explicit PAD statutes, very similar mental health advance care planning can and does take place under generic HCPA statutes—expanding the audience for PADs to all 50 states (see National Resource Center on Psychiatric Advance Directives). In addition, states are beginning to recognize legal obligations under the federal Patient Self-Determination Act of 1991, which includes informing all hospital patients that they have a right to prepare advance directives and—with certain caveats—that clinicians are obliged to follow these directives. Finally, the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) requires behavioral health facilities to ask patients if they have PADs. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced that patients have the right to formulate advance directives and to have hospital staff and practitioners who provide coercive interventions in the hospital comply with these directives. Hospitals out of compliance risk loss of Medicare and Medicaid revenue. Proponents of these directives believe thy of followed by treatment providers, crisis planning using PADs will help involuntary detainees retain control over their decision making—especially during times when they are labeled incompetent. Additionally, advocates argue that health care agents will be instrumental in providing inpatient clinicians with information that can be central to patients’ treatment, including history of side effects and relevant medical conditions. Clinical benefits Recent data from a NIH-funded study conducted by researchers at Duke University has shown that creating a PAD with a trained facilitator increases therapeutic alliance with clinicians, enhances involuntary patients' treatment satisfaction and perceived autonomy, and improves treatment decision-making capacity among people labeled with severe mental illness.\\"Facilitated Psychiatric Advance Directives: A Randomized Trial of an Intervention to Foster Advance Treatment Planning Among Persons with Severe Mental Illness\\" Jeffrey W. Swanson, Marvin S. Swartz, Eric B. Elbogen, Richard A. Van Dorn, Joelle Ferron, H. Ryan Wagner, Barbara J. McCauley, Mimi Kim. American Journal of Psychiatry, Volume 163, Number 11: 1943-1951, November 2006 Moreover, PADs provide a transportable document—increasingly accessible through electronic directories—to convey information about a detainee's treatment history, including medical disorders, emergency contact information, and medication side effects. Clinicians often have limited information about citizens detained and labeled as psychiatric patients who present or are coercively presented and labeled as in crisis. Nonetheless, these are the typical settings in which clinicians are called upon to make critical patient- management and treatment decisions, using whatever limited data may be available. With PADs, clinicians could gain immediate access to relevant information about individual cases and thus improve the quality of clinical decision-making—appropriately managing risk to patients and others’ safety while also enhancing patients’ long-term autonomy. For these reasons, PADs are seen as an innovative and effective way of enhancing values of autonomy and social welfare for detainees labeled with mental illness. Since PADs are among the first laws that are specifically intended to promote autonomy among people detained under mental health laws, wider use of PADs would empower a traditionally disenfranchised group when targeted for coercive psychiatry. Barriers National surveys in the United States indicate that although approximately 70% of people targeted by coercive psychiatry laws would want a PAD if offered assistance in completing one, less than 10% have actually completed a PAD.\\"Psychiatric Advance Directives Among Public Mental Health Consumers in Five U.S. Cities: Prevalence, Demand, and Correlates\\" Jeffrey W. Swanson, Marvin S. Swartz, Joelle Feron, Eric B. Elbogen, and Richard Van Dorn. The Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law, Volume 34, Number 1, 2006 Some people detained and forcibly drugged under coercive psychiatry laws report difficulty in understanding advance directives, skepticism about their benefit, and lack of contact with a trusted individual who could serve as proxy decision maker. The sheer complexity of filling out these legal forms, obtaining witnesses, having the documents notarized, and filing the documents in a medical record or registry may pose a formidable barrier. Recent studies of practitioners of coercive psychiatry's attitudes about PADs suggest that they are generally supportive of these legal instruments, but have significant concerns about some features of PADs and the feasibility of implementing them in usual coercive intervention settings. Clinicians are concerned about lack of access to PAD documents in a commitment, lack of staff training on PADs, lack of communication between staff across different components of mental health systems, and lack of time to review the advance directive documents. In a survey conducted of 600 psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers showed that the vast majority thought advance care planning for crises would help improve patients’ overall mental health care.\\"Clinical Decision Making and Views About Psychiatric Advance Directives\\" Eric B. Elbogen, Marvin S. Swartz, Richard Van Dorn, Jeffrey W. Swanson, Mimi Kim, and Anna Scheyett Psychiatric Services, Volume 57, Number 3: 350-355, March 2006 Further, the more clinicians knew about PAD laws, the more favorable were their attitudes toward these practices. For instance, while most psychiatrists, social workers, and psychologists surveyed believed PADs would be helpful to people detained and targeted for forced drugging and electroshock when labeled with severe mental illnesses, clinicians with more legal knowledge about PAD laws were more likely to endorse PADs as a beneficial part of patients’ treatment planning. However, many clinicians reported NOT knowing enough about how PADs work and specifically indicated they lacked resources to readily help patients fill out PADs. Thus, if clinicians knew more about advance directives and had ready assistance for creating PADs, they said they would be much more likely to help their clients develop crisis plans. Resources It thus has become clear that the potential significance of PADs is becoming widely recognized among those targeted for coercive psychiatry, survivors of coercive psychiatry, influential policy makers, clinicians, family members, and patient advocacy groups but that significantly more concerted efforts at dissemination were needed. The community of stakeholders interested in PADs and the broader concept of self-directed care are in need of online resource and gathering place for exchange of views and information. As a result, in the United States, a collaboration between the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law and Duke University has led to creation of the MacArthur Foundation-funded National Resource Center on Psychiatric Advance Directives, the only web portal exclusively devoted to developing a learning community to help people targeted for coercive psychiatry, their families, and clinicians prepare for, and ultimately prevent, coercive psychiatry interventions. The NRC-PAD includes basic information, frequently asked questions, educational webcasts, web blog, most recent research, legal analyses, and state-by-state information on PADs and patient-centered crisis planning. The NRC-PAD website thus includes easy step-by-step information to help those targeted for forced drugging, family, and clinicians complete PADs that mirror the provisions in the PAD statutes.

She was launched in 1894 and sold in 1912. Construction In April 1892, the British Admiralty sent out a request to several shipbuilders for designs and tenders for \\"large sea going torpedo boats\\", or what later became known as \\"Torpedo Boat Destroyers\\", to be built under the 1892–1893 shipbuilding programme. In January 1893, an order was placed for two ships with Laird & Co., following on from orders placed in July the previous year with the specialist torpedo boat builders Yarrows and Thornycroft. The Admiralty did not specify a standard design for destroyers, laying down broad requirements, including a trial speed of , a \\"turtleback\\" forecastle and armament, which was to vary depending on whether the ship was to be used in the torpedo boat or gunboat role. Laird's design was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was normal and deep load. Four Normand Normand water-tube boilers fed steam to 2 three-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines rated at . Four funnels were fitted. As a torpedo boat, the planned armament was a single QF 12 pounder 12 cwt ( calibre) gun on a platform on the ship's conning tower (in practice the platform was also used as the ship's bridge) and one six-pounder (57mm) gun aft, with a single fixed 18 inch (450 mm) torpedo tube in the ship's bow and two more 18 inch tubes on a rotating mount. As a gunboat, the two swivelling torpedo tubes could be removed to accommodate a further two six-pounders. Lynx was laid down at Laird's Birkenhead shipyard on 1 July 1893 as yard number 597 and was launched on 24 January 1894. She carried out Sea trials in August 1894, successfully reaching the contract speed of 27 knots, but had problems steering when running astern, and was not completed until August 1895. Service history On 26 December 1894, Lynx ran aground off the coast of Cornwall, receiving serious damage. Lynx took part in the Royal Navy's annual manoeuvres in July 1896. On 26 June 1897 she was present at the Jubilee Fleet Review at Spithead. On 30 September 1897, Lynx and the destroyer ran aground in thick fog off Dodman Point in Cornwall. A steam main aboard Thrasher ruptured as a result of the impact, killing four stokers, with Lynx less badly damaged. Both ships were refloated, with Lynx sailing to Devonport for repair. While Thrashers commanding officer was severely reprimanded for \\"reckless navigation\\" in the resulting Court Martial, Lynxs commanding officer was acquitted. Lynx served in the Devonport instructional flotilla, when in early February 1900 she was transferred to become tender to the torpedo school ship off Devonport. In 1902 she served in the Channel Squadron, underwent repairs to re-tube her boilers in May, and took part in the Coronation Review for King Edward VII in August. In February 1908, inspection revealed that Lynxs deck plating and bulkheads were rusting through. On 10 April 1912, she was sold for scrap to Ward's of Preston.

It was published in Japan in 1989 by NamcoJapanese TV commercial of Quinty and Rasāru Ishii no Childs Quest and in North America in 1990 by Hudson Soft.American TV commercial of Mendel Palace. Mendel Palace is the debut game of Satoshi Tajiri and his company Game Freak. This success inspired him to create the Pokémon series. Plot The player's character must save his girlfriend, who was kidnapped by a young girl. The backstory differs slightly between the Japanese and American versions, although the in-game presentation is the same regardless. In the American version, the player's character is named Bon-Bon and the girl he must rescue is a Princess named Candy, who is trapped in her own dream. In the Japanese version, the main character is named Carton and the girl he must rescue is merely his own girlfriend, Jenny, who has been kidnapped by Carton's younger sister Quinty (the titular character in the Japanese version), who is jealous of the attention that Jenny gets. Gameplay The game can be played by a single player, or by two players co-operatively. The players' characters are a blue- and a green-colored boy in a vest and cap. Each level consists of a single room composed of a 5 by 7 grid of floor tiles surrounded by a boundary wall. At the beginning of each level a number of enemy dolls appear and start to wander around, attempting to collide with the player. The characters have the ability to \\"flip\\" the floor tile they are standing on or adjacent to in order to propel enemy dolls away, as well as revealing new floor tiles underneath. Enemies can be destroyed by flipping them into a wall or impassable block. The player(s) must destroy every doll to complete the level and move to the next one. It is also possible to win certain levels by making a \\"stalemate\\" in which all the tiles are unflippable like the bolted metal tiles or the graffiti tiles from the Artist dolls. Each doll does a simple action that varies from each world. They vary from the basic walking motion to swimming and even aggressive tile flippers who have the same abilities to flip random tiles as the player. The level select screen shows each palace along with the enemy dolls that occupy it. Enemy dolls can be destroyed by flipping them into a wall or block, or by slamming into them from a Spinner tile. Touching an enemy causes the player to instantly lose a life. Each world has ten levels which is accompanied by a boss and a scene showing the player's girlfriend being whisked off to another part of the realm. Stars and lives for each player are tracked separately on the screen. Some rooms are in darkness where players must anticipate useful tiles and enemies well in advance. If one player loses all of his lives, then the other player must continue to play until he also loses all of his lives. There are a variety of patterns on the floor tiles that can be collected or affect gameplay. Each particular tile can hide many patterns underneath that can be revealed after multiple flippings. Development Satoshi Tajiri had initially used Nintendo's Family BASIC (1984) as a gateway to build his understanding of the internal operation of the Famicom. This inspired him to create his own handmade Famicom game development hardware from spare electronics parts, spend two years learning programming, and spend one year making Game Freak's debut game Quinty. Tajiri had already written entire issues of his magazine called Game Freak solely about his favorite arcade game, Xevious (1983), so he wanted Quinty to be published in Japan by Namco, which had made Xevious and several other cute, colorful arcade games. Taijiri marketed Quinty to American NES licensees by driving a rental car \\"all over the West Coast\\". It was rejected by most as \\"too cute\\" until Hudson Soft accepted while altering the title and the package art to reduce cuteness. Reception About 60,000 copies of Mendel Palace were sold in the US.

Named after Maj. Gen. George Henry Thomas, she was used by the Navy as a gunboat in waterways of the Confederate South.  Constructed in Chattanooga, Tennessee in 1864  General Thomas was one of four light wooden gunboats built at Chattanooga, Tennessee, for the War Department in 1864. After cruising on the Ohio River without being formally commissioned in June and July 1864, she commissioned 8 August 1864 at Bridgeport, Alabama, Acting Master Gilbert Morton in command.  Patrolling the Tennessee River  Assigned to the 11th district of the Mississippi Squadron, commanded by Lt. Mordeau Forrest, General Thomas served as a patrol vessel on the Tennessee River, above Muscle Shoals, Alabama. During this period Confederate General John Bell Hood was mounting his campaign into Tennessee to divert General William Tecumseh Sherman's march on Atlanta, Georgia, and General Thomas patrolled the river unceasingly to prevent the Southern troops from crossing.  Engaged against the forces of Confederate General Hood  At Decatur, Alabama, 28 October 1864, the gunboat engaged strong batteries from General John Bell Hood's army. After passing the batteries downstream and sustaining several hits, General Thomas rounded to and, with Union Army gunboat Stone River, poured such a withering crossfire into the emplacements that the Confederates were forced to withdraw. After Hood's repulse at Nashville, Tennessee in December, General Thomas was used on the upper Tennessee River to block his escape route. She aided General James B. Steedman in his successful attack on Decatur 27 December by giving his army concentrated gunfire support, and attempted to pass over Elk River Shoals to prevent a Southern crossing of the river. The Tennessee River was too low, however, and Forrest and his gunboats could not cross. General Thomas returned to Bridgeport 30 December 1864, but was soon active again. On 26 February 1865 she joined the other gunboats of the 11th district and, taking advantage of unusually high water, crossed Elk River Shoals. The ships destroyed the camp of Southern General Philip D. Roddey, captured a quantity of supplies and destroyed communications at Lamb's Ferry before returning to Bridgeport 4 March.  Post-war return to the War Department  General Thomas continued to patrol between Bridgeport and Decatur, Alabama, until she was turned over to the War Department at Bridgeport 3 June 1865.

He had lead roles in The Typewriter, directed by FM Croissant in 2004, followed by Unscrewed 2, directed by Florian Huber in 2005 and Butterfly Child, directed by Daniel Schmidt in 2006 In 2006, Schölermann took the part of Christian Mann in the soap opera Verbotene Liebe. After being cast in August, he first appeared on-screen on November 27, 2006. The role brought him international fame when Christian was paired with Oliver Sabel, played by Jo Weil. Christian and Olli became a phenomenon with fans all over the world. The couple was featured in many different stories together over the years, much to the producers fear of breaking up the couple. Schölermann and his on-screen-partner Weil were judges on Mr. Gay World 2009. In 2012, it was announced that Schölermann would take over hosting duties for The Voice of Germany from previous host Stefan Gödde. It was originally planned that his new work wouldn't affect Schölermann's work on Verbotene Liebe. However, his screen time got reduced and he then vacated the role on December 7, 2012 with Christian taking a job abroad. Online rumors indicated that Schölermann would return to the soap opera in early 2013, when the season finale of The Voice of Germany aired. These rumors turned out to be untrue as Schölermann's management made a statement that there are no plans of Thore Schölermann returning to Verbotene Liebe full-time. However, he would be open to a short stint if the production could schedule around his other engagements. In June 2013 he returned filming, with his on-screen return planned for September.

In August she escorted ships of the 1st Minelaying Squadron on several operations, and on the 28th was detached for duty with the Free French expedition to Dakar (Operation Menace). After the operation was abandoned on 25 September, she escorted the damaged battleship to Freetown, where Echo was retained for local convoy defence, not rejoining the Flotilla until the end of October. On 21 May 1941, Echo and five other destroyers were deployed as the escort to the battlecruiser and battleship on their way to the Denmark Strait, during the search for the German warships and . On 25 May, the day after the Battle of the Denmark Strait, Echo escorted the damaged Prince of Wales to Iceland. At the end of July she was deployed in the destroyer screen of Force P—the carriers and and the cruisers and —during the raid on Kirkenes and Petsamo.

From 8 December, she and provided the screen for the cruiser escorting the Russian Convoy PQ 6 to Kola Inlet. On arrival on the 19th, Echo was detached to escort a Russian merchant ship to Murmansk. She was attacked by two German Ju 88 bombers, but spared by the timely arrival of Russian Hurricane fighters and Edinburgh. She then escorted the return Convoy QP 4, arriving back at Scapa Flow on 10 January 1942. Echo returned to Scapa Flow to provide anti- submarine defence for convoys between the UK and Iceland. On mid-June she began a refit in a Humber shipyard, returning to Scapa Flow on 22 August to join the 8th Destroyer Flotilla. On 2 September she was deployed to support Russian Convoy PQ 18. Further Arctic convoy duty followed, escorting returning Convoy QP 15 in November, then Convoy JW 51A in December 1942, and Convoy JW 52 in January 1943. In February Echo began a refit at a Humber shipyard, rejoining the 8th Destroyer Flotilla in June, and sailing for Gibraltar on 17 June.

She returned home to join the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla after repairs – first at Freetown, Sierra Leone, and subsequently at Gibraltar. In this period, one member of her crew was Charles Causley, the Cornish poet and broadcaster, who served as a Coder. He subsequently published two poems about the ship and this voyage: 'HMS Eclipse Approaches Freetown'; and 'Immunity', which recounts an inoculation session, and then anticipates the ship's loss later in the war. From 12 April 1941 Eclipse was refitted at Devonport Dockyard, sailing in early June to rejoin the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla.

Sinking of Gaetano Donizetti The Italian of 3,428 tons, had been confiscated by the Germans to bring arms to Rhodes. The Germans stowed some 1,600 prisoners in the cargo hold. Gaetano Donizetti set sail on 22 September 1943 . The vessel sailed along the east coast of Rhodes, and headed south-west, passing Lindos to the south. The Italian ship was escorted by the German torpedo boat TA10 under Oberleutnant Jobst Hahndorff. This was the former French torpedo boat La Pomone and later the Italian FR 42. Around 01:10 that night (on 23 September), the convoy was detected by Eclipse under Commander E. Mack, who immediately opened fire. Gaetano Donizetti went down in seconds, taking with her the entire crew and all the Italian prisoners of war and German guards and crew. TA10 was heavily damaged and later towed back to Rhodes, where it was scuttled a few days later. Demise On 24 October 1943 Eclipse hit a mine east off Kalymnos in position . She broke in two and sank within five minutes with the loss of 119 of the ship's company and 134 soldiers (from A Company, 4th Battalion, Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment)).

Although assigned to the Home Fleet upon completion, the ship was attached to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1935–36 during the Abyssinia Crisis. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–39, she spent considerable time in Spanish waters, enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides of the conflict. Encounter was assigned to convoy escort and anti- submarine patrol duties in the Western Approaches, when World War II began in September 1939. She participated in the Norwegian Campaign before joining Force H in mid-1940 and was present during the Battles of Dakar and Cape Spartivento later that year. The ship was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1941 where she escorted convoys to Malta. Encounter was badly damaged while refitting at Malta a few weeks after arriving in the Mediterranean and was briefly reassigned to Force H after her repairs were completed before rejoining the Mediterranean Fleet later in the year. Late in the year, the ship was transferred to the Eastern Fleet at Singapore and spent several months in early 1942 on convoy escort duties under the control of American- British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDACOM). She was one of the Allied ships retasked to intercept Japanese invasion convoys during the Dutch East Indies Campaign in February 1942 and participated in the Battle of the Java Sea. Encounter was sunk a few days later in the Second Battle of the Java Sea on 1 March and most of her crew were rescued by a Japanese ship the next day. About a quarter of them died in captivity before the end of the war in 1945. The ship's wreck was discovered in 2007 and had been almost totally destroyed by illegal salvagers by 2016.

Encounter collided with her sister off Portland on 18 June and was under repair at Devonport Dockyard 18 June–8 July. The ship was attached to the Mediterranean Fleet, together with most of the rest of her flotilla, beginning in September 1935, during the Abyssinian Crisis. She collided with another of her sisters, , on 19 November during a night exercise off Alexandria. While not severely damaged, Encounter was repaired at Malta from 29 November to 8 February 1936 and returned home with the rest of her sisters the next month. The flotilla patrolled Spanish waters in the Bay of Biscay during the Spanish Civil War, enforcing the edicts of the Non-Intervention Committee, in January–March 1937. The ship's bow was badly damaged in another collision on 26 September 1938 and she was repaired at Hebburn beginning the following day. Her repairs lasted through October and then Encounter was attached to the Mediterranean Fleet on non-intervention patrol duties from Gibraltar for the first three months of 1939. The ship began a refit on 15 July, but it was interrupted by the rise of tensions before the start of World War II in September. She was assigned to the 12th DF upon recommissioning and manned with a crew that largely consisted of reservists.English, p. 69 World War II Encounter was assigned to convoy escort duties in the Western Approaches Command for the first three months of the war before transferring to Scapa Flow and joining the Home Fleet.

She was refitted at Sheerness Dockyard from 20 June to 20 July and was then transferred to Gibraltar to join the 13th DF of Force H. En route, she escorted several troop ships and the aircraft carrier . During Operation Hurry, Encounter and three other destroyers escorted Argus to a position south-west of Sardinia so the carrier could fly off her Hawker Hurricane fighters to Malta on 2 August.Nailer, p. 152 On 13 September, Force H rendezvoused with a convoy that was carrying troops intended to capture Dakar from the Vichy French. Ten days later, they attacked Dakar, but failed to take the city.

This was an unsuccessful night torpedo attack by eight of Ark Royals Fairey Swordfish on the Tirso Dam in Sardinia. The British ships returned to Gibraltar on 4 February and began preparing for Operation Grog, a naval bombardment of Genoa, that was successfully carried out five days later.Admiralty Historical Section, pp. 48–53; Rohwer, p. 58 The ship was then transferred to the South Atlantic for escort duties for a time before departing to join the Mediterranean Fleet at Alexandria on 14 April. While refitting in a drydock in Malta, Encounter was damaged by blast and splinters when a bomb detonated on the floor of the dock during an air raid on 29 April. Another bomb struck the ship's forecastle the next day and blew a hole in the hull. She was hit by another bomb on 16 May that blew another hole in the hull and disabled her boilers and cruising turbines when water flooded in through the hull. Repairs took until July to complete,English, pp. 69–90 in time for the ship to participate in Operation Substance, during which she escorted six empty freighters from Malta to Gibraltar, 23–26 July.Admiralty Historical Section, p. 148 A few days later, she escorted reinforcements to Malta during Operation Style. On 22 August, Force H, escorted by Encounter and four other destroyers, sailed to attack the airfield at Tempio Pausania, Sardinia, as a diversion for as she laid a minefield off Livorno, Italy.Rohwer, pp. 89, 94 The ship was reassigned to the South Atlantic Command for the month of September before rejoining the Mediterranean Fleet in Alexandria on 16 October.English, p. 70 She spent most of the next month escorting convoys to Tobruk.

Encounter was transferred to the Eastern Fleet the following month and departed Alexandria on 14 November bound for Singapore. En route, she rendezvoused with the battleship and the battlecruiser of Force Z at Colombo, Ceylon, on 28 November. The ships arrived at their destination on 2 December.Rohwer, p. 111 Encounter required a refit upon her arrival and was thus unavailable when Force Z sortied on 8 December on their ill-fated attempt to intercept the Japanese invasion convoys.Middlebrook & Mahoney, p. 70 Four days later, the ship escorted a convoy from Singapore to the Sunda Strait. She remained based at Singapore until 20 January 1942 when she was transferred to the 7th DF of the China Force. Under the command of ABDACOM, the force was tasked with escorting convoys to and from Singapore and the Dutch East Indies. Encounter continued to escort convoys until late February.English, p. 70; Gill, pp. 509, 518, 580; Rohwer, p. 137 =First Battle of the Java Sea= On 25 February, Vice Admiral Conrad Helfrich of the Royal Netherlands Navy, the new commander of Allied naval forces in the East Indies, ordered all available warships to join the Dutch Rear Admiral Karel Doorman's Eastern Striking Force at Surabaya. Encounter, together with the destroyers and , escorted the British heavy cruiser and the Australian light cruiser , there that same day.Shores, Cull & Izawa 1993, p. 233 After they had arrived the following day, Doorman's entire force of five cruisers and nine destroyers departed Surabaya at 18:30 to patrol off Eastern Java in hopes of intercepting the oncoming invasion convoy which had been spotted earlier that morning. The Japanese were further north than he anticipated and his ships found nothing.Gill, pp. 607–08 His own ships were located at 09:35 on the following morning, 27 February, and were continuously tracked by the Japanese. Doorman ordered a return to Surabaya at 10:30 and his ships were attacked by eight bombers from the Kanoya Air Group at 14:37. They claimed to have made two hits on Jupiter, but actually missed the British destroyer. Just as his leading ships were entering harbour, he received reports of Japanese ships to the north and Doorman ordered his ships to turn about to intercept them.Shores, Cull & Izawa 1993, p. 238 Aware of Doorman's movements, the Japanese commander, Rear Admiral Takeo Takagi, detached the convoy's two escorting destroyer flotillas, each consisting of a light cruiser and seven destroyers, to intercept the Allied ships in conjunction with his own pair of heavy cruisers, ( and ), which were escorted by a pair of destroyers.Grove, pp. 86–89 His heavy cruisers opened fire at long range at 15:47 with little effect. The light cruisers and destroyers closed to ranges between and began firing Type 93 \\"Long Lance\\" torpedoes beginning at 16:03.Dull, pp. 76–78 All of these torpedoes failed to damage their targets, although one torpedo hit Exeter and failed to detonate at 16:35.Grove, p. 93 Three minutes later, Haguro changed the course of the battle when one of her shells detonated in Exeters forward boiler room,Lacroix & Wells, p. 298 knocking six of her boilers off-line. The ship sheered out of line to avoid another torpedo and slowed, followed by all of the trailing cruisers.Shores, Cull & Izawa 1993, p. 239 Perth laid a smoke screen to protect ExeterGrove, p. 94 and the Allied ships sorted themselves into separate groups as they attempted to disengage. Exeter was escorted by one Dutch and all three British destroyers in one group and the other cruisers and the American destroyers formed the other group. The Japanese did not initially press their pursuit as they maneuvered to use their torpedoes against the crippled Exeter, which could only make , and her escorts.Dull, pp. 80–82 The Japanese began launching torpedoes beginning at 17:20 at ranges of , but they all missed. For some reason, two Japanese destroyers continued to close before firing their torpedoes at and Encounter and Electra pulled out of line to counter-attack. They engaged and at close range as they closed. Encounter and Minegumo exchanged fire at ranges down to for about 10 minutes, but they failed to inflict any significant damage on each other. On the other hand, Asagumo was damaged by Electra, but the Japanese ship sank the British destroyer at 17:46. Exeter continued south to Surabaya, escorted by Encounter and the Dutch destroyer . Doorman's repeated unsuccessful, and ultimately fatal, attempts to reach the transports concentrated the Japanese on the task of protecting the transports and allowed the damaged British cruiser to reach harbour.Dull, pp. 82–86 =Second Battle of the Java Sea= The following day, after making temporary repairs and refuelling, Exeter, Encounter and the American destroyer were ordered to sail to Colombo, via the Sunda Strait. They departed on the evening of 28 February, but were intercepted by the Japanese heavy cruisers Nachi, Haguro, and and the destroyers , , and on the morning of 1 March.Grove, p. 95 About 08:00, the British ships spotted two of the Japanese cruisers, one of which launched its spotting floatplanes. Two others were seen closing in, and both launched their aircraft before opening fire at about 09:30.Shores, Cull & Izawa 1993, p. 306 The Allied ships laid smoke and turned away to the east with the Japanese to their north and south.Dull, p. 87 Exeter was able to reach a speed of Gill, p. 623 before the first hit on her again detonated in a boiler room and knocked out all power around 11:20. Encounter turned back to lay a smoke screen to protect the immobilised cruiser, and aid survivors, but she was soon immobilised herself by shell hits and splinters and set on fire.https://www.navybooks.com/blog/2017/03/01/the-sinking-of-hms- exeter-1-march-1942/ Lieutenant Commander Eric Morgan, the destroyer's captain, ordered the ship scuttled to prevent her capture by the Japanese.

Among the rescued was Lieutenant (later Sir) Sam Falle, an officer aboard Encounter, who would go on to become a British diplomat. This humanitarian decision by Lieutenant Commander Shunsaku Kudō placed Ikazuchi at risk of submarine attack, and interfered with her fighting ability due to the sheer numbers of rescued sailors. The action was later the subject of a book and a TV special. . A summary of the 2007 television program. 38 of the ship's crew subsequently died in captivity.

Although assigned to the Home Fleet upon completion in 1934, the ship was attached to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1935–1936 during the Abyssinia Crisis. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939 she spent considerable time in Spanish waters, enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides of the conflict. Escapade was assigned to convoy escort and anti-submarine patrol duties in the Western Approaches when World War II began in September 1939, but transferred back to the Home Fleet at the end of the year. After participating in the Norwegian Campaign in early 1940, she participated in anti-invasion duty and escorted capital ships to Gibraltar and in Operation Menace. The destroyer returned to the British Isles for continued escort duty, punctuated by Operation Rubble and the hunt for Scharnhorst and Gneisenau in early 1941. Following a midyear refit she escorted Arctic convoys and a convoy to Malta, then went into another refit in mid-1942 before returning to the Atlantic from late 1942 to early 1943. After a refit, she returned to duty in the Atlantic later that year, but was sidelined for more than a year when a projectile from her Hedgehog anti-submarine weapon exploded, causing significant damage. Following her return to duty at the end of 1944, she escorted convoys in the last months of the war, then was used for training before being sold for scrap in 1947.

The ships' complement was 145 officers and ratings.Lenton, p. 156 The ships mounted four 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark IX guns in single mounts, designated 'A', 'B', 'X' and 'Y' from front to rear. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, they had two quadruple mounts for the Vickers AA machinegun. The E class was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for torpedoes.Whitley, p. 103 One depth charge rack and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began.English, p. 141 Wartime modifications Escapade had her rear torpedo tubes replaced by a 12-pounder (76 mm) AA gun by April 1941. In June–September 1943, she was converted into an escort destroyer. A Type 286 short-range surface-search radar was fitted and a Type 271 target indication radar was installed above the bridge, replacing the director-control tower and rangefinder. Her short-range AA armament was augmented by four Oerlikon guns and the .50-calibre machine guns were replaced by a pair of Oerlikons. A split Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar was installed abreast 'B' gun and stowage for a total of 70 depth charges meant that 'Y' gun and the 12-pounder had to be removed to compensate for their weight.English, p. 141; Friedman, pp. 237, 239, 241–245; Lenton, p. 157 After the accident that destroyed her Hedgehog mount in September 1943, the ship required extensive repairs and the navy took the opportunity to install two new Squid anti-submarine mortars in lieu of 'A' gun. The ship also received a HF/DF radio direction finder mounted on a pole mainmast. A Type 277 radar replaced the Type 271 and the Type 286 was superseded by a Type 291 radar.Friedman, pp. 239, 246 Construction and career Escapade, the only ship of that name to serve with the Royal Navy,Colledge, p. 116 was ordered 1 November 1932, from Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company under the 1931 Naval Programme. She was laid down on 30 March 1932 at their Greenock dockyard, and launched on 30 January 1934. The ship was commissioned on 30 August 1934, at a total cost of £249,987, excluding government-furnished equipment such as the armament.English, pp. 63–64 Escapade and her sister ships were assigned to the 5th Destroyer Flotilla (DF) and accompanied the Home Fleet during its West Indies cruise between January and March 1935. She collided with her sister off Portland on 18 June, but was only lightly damaged. The ship was attached to the Mediterranean Fleet, together with most of the rest of her flotilla, beginning in September 1935. Her deployment was a result of the Abyssinian Crisis, after which she returned home with the rest of her sisters in March 1936. The flotilla patrolled Spanish waters during the Spanish Civil War, enforcing the edicts of the Non-Intervention Committee, Escapade being detached for this duty five times between January 1937 and March 1939. She was struck by one of her sisters, , on 18 January when her engines broke down and Eclipse could not manoeuvre clear in time; repairs took 17 days to complete. The ship was placed in reserve on 16 June at Devonport, but was recommissioned on 2 August to participate in the Reserve Fleet Review three days later.English, pp. 69–70 In September 1939 she was allocated to the 12th Destroyer Flotilla, with which she served on escort and patrol duties. Escapade unsuccessfully attacked single U-boats in the English Channel on 5 November and 15 November, rescuing survivors from the torpedoed SS Navasota on 5 December.Haarr 2013, p. 446 Escorting convoy HN14 to Norway on 25 February 1940, she spotted the surfaced U-63, but the submarine dived as Escapade approached, after which she made a depth charge attack. The depth charges dropped by her and the other three destroyers of the escort damaged the U-boat and forced the latter to surface, where the submarine was sunk by gunfire from the other three destroyers, as Escapade was out of position. Despite having made the first attack, her crew was not credited with the sinking.Haarr 2013, pp. 109–110 The destroyer served in the Norwegian Campaign from 7 April, when she left Scapa Flow with the fleet in response to the sighting of the German invasion force in Heligoland Bight for what was erroneously thought to be a breakout into the Atlantic.Haarr 2013, p. 413 The Home Fleet came under repeated air attack on 10 April, but Escapade was unscathed.Haarr 2009, p. 287 The destroyer returned to Scapa Flow after the sortie and screened the light cruiser Southampton as the latter departed Scapa Flow alongside her sister ship Electra on 12 April. She was detached to protect troopships landing at Harstad on 15 and 16 April, and remained there for the rest of the month and much of May, escorting empty transports into the North Sea, pursuing U-boat sightings, and transporting orders and personnel between the landing sites.Haarr 2010, pp. 198, 208, 210 After screening the last evacuation convoys out of Norway in early June, the destroyer was sent to escort the aircraft carrier Ark Royal to join Force H at Gibraltar from 17 June. To guard against a German invasion of the British Isles, Escapade returned to that area with the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla in August, but was detached after three weeks to escort the battleship Barham in Operation Menace, the failed attempt to capture the West African port of Dakar from Vichy France. 1941–1947 Returning to the British Isles after the end of Operation Menace in late September, Escapade served as an escort for the next eight months, participating in the January 1941 Operation Rubble, the escape of Norwegian merchant ships from Sweden to England. In the next month, the destroyer escorted the battleship Nelson in the unsuccessful search for German battlecruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, which had broken out in Operation Berlin to raid merchant shipping in the North Atlantic. Escapade was under refit on the River Tyne between 27 May and 10 July after escorting Convoy HX125. The destroyer then rejoined the 4th Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet, forming part of the escort for the battleship HMS Prince of Wales in August, which was transporting Prime Minister Winston Churchill to the Atlantic Charter conference in Newfoundland. Returning from this mission, she escorted the aircraft carriers and Furious as they attacked the Axis-occupied ports of Petsamo, Finland, and Kirkenes, Norway, in Operation EF.Rohwer, p. 88 Upon her return, Escapade was assigned to protect the Arctic convoys to Arkhangelsk in the Soviet Union, arriving at the latter with Operation Dervish, the first convoy, on 31 August. She continued this task, covering Convoys PQ 1, PQ 6 and QP 4,Rohwer, pp. 104, 123–124, 129–130 until beginning a refit at Immingham on 9 February that lasted until 20 March 1942. After escorting the Norwegian tanker Lind into Methil after the latter broke out from Sweden in April, Escapade escorted the capital ships covering Convoys PQ 14 and PQ 15 later that month.Rohwer, pp. 158, 162 The ship then covered the May attempt to transfer the damaged light cruiser Trinidad from Murmansk to Iceland, which ended with the scuttling of the latter due to bomb damage. She then escorted Convoy QP 12 back from Kola Bay without incident. Survivors of a sunken U-boat clambering aboard Escapade in May 1943 Rejoining the 5th Destroyer Flotilla on 5 June, the destroyer escorted Convoy WS19Z to Malta in Operation Harpoon, then did the same for the aircraft carrier HMS Argus for the return journey. After helping to cover Convoy PQ 17 to the Soviet Union, the destroyer was refitted at Liverpool from 20 July to 24 September. Following the completion of the refit, she escorted the aircraft carrier HMS Furious to Gibraltar, arriving on 25 October. After again escorting Convoys KMF1 and KMF2 for Operation Torch, she returned to Greenock on 19 November with Convoy MKF1(X). Escapade was repaired on the Thames between 27 November and 23 December, joining Escort Group B3 of the Western Approaches Command for convoy escort duty in the North Atlantic, on which she spent the next six months. This period included escort duty with Convoys HX 228, ONS 175, HX 232, and HX 239 during the defeat of the U-boat campaign in May 1943. Receiving the Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar during a refit at Cardiff between 3 June and 5 September, Escapade began escorting Convoy ONS 18 after a brief working up. While engaged in this duty off Northern Ireland on 20 September, she fired her Hedgehog at a submarine contact, but one of its projectiles prematurely exploded, killing fifteen ratings, and wounding ten others, one mortally, in addition to destroying 'B' gun, the Hedgehog and heavily damaging the bridge and wheelhouse. It took more than a year to repair Escapade, which returned to duty on 30 December 1944. She trialled the Squid anti-submarine mortar while serving with the 8th Escort Group in the last months of the war, and escorted Norwegian personnel to their home country in May 1945. The destroyer briefly served with the Anti-Submarine Training Flotilla, and was approved for scrapping on 18 February 1946. She was accordingly ordered stripped of equipment on 15 November and paid off as tender to HMS Tartar on 3 December. Handed over to the British Iron & Steel Corporation for scrapping on 17 May, she was broken up at Grangemouth, Scotland, by G.W. Brunton beginning on 3 August.

It is separated from Carlisle by the M6 Motorway, and it is close to other dormitory villages in the area, such as Wetheral, Cumwhinton and Aglionby. It is part of the Wetheral civil parish. In 2018 it had an estimated population of 2366. History During the Second World War, on 11 March 1943, a village dance was being held in the village hall when a bomb penetrated the hall roof which resulted in a local farmer being killed. In the field on the opposite side of the Tyne Valley Line to the Church, rubber tubes were laid out so as to represent railway lines to make the German Luftwaffe think that it was a major railway sidings of Carlisle. It is thought that the Luftwaffe, which was returning from a bombing raid on the munitions factory at Gretna, released their bomb load on to the fake sidings in the hope of destroying them, and also to lighten their plane load for their flight home. On the same night, a bomb also landed near to the War Memorial in the churchyard Although it did not explode, It did damage some of the church windows. Community Scotby School is the main primary school for children living in the area. It has around 282 registered pupils, and its catchment includes Wetheral village and parts of eastern Carlisle. There is a village green in the centre of the village, and the village hall is located beside it. The hall, which is arranged as a single floor, was constructed in 1926, and an extension was added to the front of the building in 1953. Also on this side of the green is a building which used to be the Quaker Meeting house. It is now part of a small development called Scotby Green Steading. The Quakers had a strong religious presence in the village going back to at least the mid 1600s. The Meeting House was used by them until as late the Second World War. Along with the cemetery adjacent to the Meeting House, the Quakers also had a burial ground situated off Broomfallen Road on what is known as White Hill. This can be seen from Ladysteps; it is the small wood to the right of the skyline. The Royal Oak public house Opposite the green is the village Shop and Post Office, a public house and Scotby Parish Centre. The Parish Centre was originally built as a Reading Room by the Quakers in the 1880s. The village Church is the All Saints Church, which is located on a piece of high ground situated between the village green and the Tyne Valley Line railway. The church was consecrated on 11 October 1855. Before this date, residents of the village had to travel to the Holy Trinity church in Wetheral to worship, and to be buried in Wetheral Churchyard cemetery. To reach the cemetery, a number of Corpse Roads were used and many of these lonnings exist today, for example, the lonning at the top of Ghyll Road in Scotby.http://www.sccparish.church Sport The village has its own cricket club, Scotby Cricket Club. Transport There was formerly a railway station on the Tyne Valley Line, however the station was closed in 1959, before the Beeching Axe. The Settle-Carlisle Railway also runs through the village and Scotby also had a station on this line until 1942.

During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939, she spent considerable time in Spanish waters, enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides of the conflict. Esk was converted to a minelayer when World War II began in September 1939, and spent most of her time laying mines. During the Norwegian Campaign of April–June 1940, the ship laid mines in Norwegian territorial waters before the Germans invaded, but was recalled to home waters to resume her minelaying duties in early May. During one such sortie, Esk was sunk during the Texel Disaster on the night of 31 August 1940, when she ran into a newly laid German minefield.

During the Munich Crisis, Esk and her sister ship were temporarily attached to the 9th Destroyer Flotilla at the Nore, and practiced minelaying on 3 October 1938. Esk was reduced to reserve on 24 June 1939, and was not recommissioned until 2 August. She attended the Reserve Fleet Review on the 15th, and then began conversion as a minelayer beginning on 28 August.English, p. 72 The conversion was completed on 7 September 1939, and the ship was assigned to the 20th Destroyer Flotilla the next day. Esk laid mines in the Heligoland Bight with her sister Express on the night of 9/10 September.Rohwer, p. 4 She escorted the battleship from Scapa Flow to Portsmouth from 23–26 September, and then conducted minelaying operations from Milford Haven and Portsmouth through December. On 17–18 December, Esk, Express, and laid 240 mines off the mouth of the Ems.Rohwer, p. 12 She was refitted at Portsmouth from 29 December to 26 January 1940. After the completion of her refit, Esk escorted the auxiliary minelayers and for the next six months, as they laid mines in the East Coast Barrier, as well as making occasional minelaying sorties of her own. On 3 March, Esk, Express, and laid mines near Horns Reef in the Heligoland Bight, that sank the about 13 March.Rohwer, p. 16 The ship was assigned to the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow at the beginning of April, and was allocated to \\"Force WV\\" with the ships of the 20th Flotilla for Operation Wilfred, an operation to lay mines in the Vestfjord to prevent the transport of Swedish iron ore from Narvik to Germany.

Career Carvajal was born in San Antonio de los Baños and lived in poverty his entire life before his death in Havana. During his life he was a mailman who performed walking and running exhibitions in Cuba (including a journey across the full length of the island). Carvajal traveled to the United States to compete in the Olympic marathon at the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, but lost all of his money gambling in New Orleans, Louisiana and was forced to hitchhike and walk the rest of the way. He arrived at the race dressed in street clothes and hastily cut around the legs of his trousers to make them more like shorts. Carvajal performed well in the race despite stopping to chat with spectators and snatching some peaches from a spectator's car. Later in the race he saw an apple tree and stopped to eat some apples which turned out to be rotten. After stopping to nap and recover, Carvajal rallied to finish fourth. Carvajal returned to St. Louis the following year to run in the inaugural All-Western Marathon, where he finished third, in a time of 3:44. Carvajal was selected to represent Cuba in the 1906 Olympic Marathon at Athens, Greece, with his expenses funded by the Cuban Government. However, he disappeared after landing in Italy, and never arrived in Athens. He was thought to be dead, and his obituary was published in the Cuban newspapers, but he later returned to Havana on a Spanish steamer. He then turned professional and would go on to defeat American distance runner Henry W. Shelton in a six-hour race in 1907. On May 8, 1909, he participated in a Marathon Derby on a six-laps-per-mile track at the Polo Grounds in New York City with an international field of twelve other professional marathon runners, the most notable being Dorando Pietri. Carvajal was quickly lapped by the leaders after they had completed the first mile in 5:02. The race was won by Henri St. Yves of France in a time of 2:44:05; Carvajal finished, but was never out of last place.ST.

Although assigned to the Home Fleet upon completion, the ship was attached to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1935–36 during the Abyssinia Crisis. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939 she spent considerable time in Spanish waters, enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides of the conflict. Exmouth was assigned to convoy escort and anti-submarine patrol duties in the Western Approaches when World War II began in September 1939. She was sunk by a German submarine in January 1940 while escorting a merchant ship north of Scotland. Description Exmouth displaced at standard load and at deep load.

The ship's complement was 175 officers and ratings.Whitley, pp. 104–05 The ship mounted five 45-calibre 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark IX guns in single mounts. For anti-aircraft defence, Exmouth had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0.5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for torpedoes. One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began.English, p. 141 Service Exmouth was ordered on 1 November 1932 under the 1931 Naval Programme, and was laid down at Portsmouth Dockyard on 15 March 1933. She was launched on 30 January 1934, named the following day, and commissioned for service on 9 November 1934. On commissioning, Exmouth was assigned as leader of the 5th Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet. The increased tensions between Italy and Abyssinia – eventually leading to the outbreak of the Second Italo-Abyssinian War – caused the Admiralty to attach the flotilla to the Mediterranean Fleet from August 1935 to March 1936, although Exmouth was refitted in Alexandria from 4 October 1935 to 5 January 1936. The ship patrolled Spanish waters during the Spanish Civil War enforcing the edicts of the Non-Intervention Committee in between annual refits at Portsmouth between 17 November 1936 and 19 January 1937 and 21 November 1938 and 16 January 1939. She returned to Britain in March and Exmouth was assigned to training duties and local flotilla work based at Portsmouth on 28 April. She carried out these duties until 2 August, when she was placed into full commission as the leader of the 12th Destroyer Flotilla.English, p. 64 Exmouth and her flotilla were initially assigned to the Home Fleet upon the outbreak of World War II in September 1939. The ship and two of her flotilla mates, and , escorted the battlecruiser as she searched for German commerce raiders south of Iceland in late November.Rohwer, p. 9 In December, she was transferred to the Western Approaches Command to carry out patrols and escort convoys, but was transferred to Rosyth in January 1940 to carry out the same duties in the North Sea. She was escorting the merchant Cyprian Prince on 21 January 1940 when she was spotted by the , under the command of Karl-Heinrich Jenisch, and torpedoed at 05:35. She sank with the loss of all hands. After sinking Exmouth, the submarine also fired on Cyprian Prince whose master deemed it too dangerous to pick up survivors. Eighteen bodies were later found washed ashore by a schoolboy playing truant near Wick. They were buried with full military honours in the cemetery at Wick. Aftermath The wreck of Exmouth was discovered in the Moray Firth in July 2001 by an independent expedition, with their findings being verified by Historic Scotland. The wreck is one of those listed as a 'protected place' under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986.

He was the son and successor of Raymond III and Ermessenda.Stasser, 15. Raymond must have been born after his parents' marriage in 1027×29, and is first mentioned in a document of 1044. He had a younger brother, Sunyer II, who is sometimes also styled count and who was excommunicated in 1079. His reign was characterised by ceaseless wars and litigations with his cousins Artau I and Artau II of Pallars Sobirà, yet it was transformative in the history of Pallars through the new modes of exercising comital power that Raymond introduced. The viscounties of Pallars Jussà during the time of Raymond IV were Vilamur, Bellera, and Orcau.Kosto, 166. There is a rather large and well-preserved series of records for the reign of Raymond IV largely because he pioneered the use of written conventions for the making of agreements in Pallars. In this he was helped along by the same scribe who had at times served his father since 1040 and who had worked at the court of his father-in-law Arnau Mir de Tost for some time, Vidal. Establishing his power Early in his reign Raymond exacted a collective oath from the general public, claiming to rely on precedent established earlier that century by his father Raymond III and uncle William II of Pallars Sobirà.Kosto, 54. His action in fact harkened back to the original public function of the count during Carolingian times. He renewed the collective oath a second time at a later date.Kosto, 258. In 1055 Raymond married Valença, daughter of Arnau Mir de Tost, and granted him four castles as a pledge to keep the oaths he had sworn for her hand.Kosto, 125. She acted alongside him in many of his charters and conventions. In 1056-1057 Raymond and Valença ceded their \\"power\\" (potestas) over the castle of Orcau to Ramon Mir and his wife Maria.Kosto, 93-94. In 1088 they renewed the concession to Ramon Mir's son Tedball Ramon. This and similar actions have led certain historians to consider Raymond weak in relation to his vassals. He was even forced out of power at one point, but had regained it by the early 1070s. Raymond had three sons by Valença: Pere Ramon, Arnau Ramon, and Bernat Ramon. The eldest two succeeded him and ruled jointly until around 1112, when they were succeeded by their brother Bernat, who ruled until 1124. Raymond did take part in the Reconquista of Muslim lands. He promised the vills and castles of the Vallferrera to Orset and Drogo after their reconquest.Kosto, 98 (villae ... castelli ... Val Ferrera ... Orseth ... Drocho). Quarrels with his cousins A page of the 12th-century manuscript Liber Feudorum Maior illustrating the moment when Count Raymond and Ficapal, spouse of Sibila and vassal of the count, reached an agreement on the castles of Guilareny and Vallferrera In 1064 Raymond and Artau I reached their first agreement (convenientia, \\"convention\\"), which saw a castle pass to Raymond as a pledge for future negotiations.Kosto, 138. A second agreement of 30 May 1067 saw Artau cede the monastery of Santa Maria de Lavaix to Raymond and quitclaim several villages (villae). Around 1080 a series of conventions were made between Raymond and either Artau I or II (the elder died around 1081). As a guarantee for the process, Raymond granted the potestas of the castle of TalarnKosto, 86-89, describes in detail the structure of command of Talarn under Raymond. to two of his chief magnates, Pere Ramon I d'Erill and Mir Guirreta II de Bellera, while Artau granted the same of his castle of Salás to two of his men, Guillem Guitard de Vallferrera and Ramon Bernat.Kosto, 139. Both castles stood not far apart on opposite sides of the Noguera Pallaresa where it defined the border of the two counties. The final settlement and exchange of castles took place in the presence of Sancho Ramírez, King of Aragon.Kosto, 140. On 20 July 1094 Raymond commended (as fiefs) Llimiana and Mur to Artau II and granted him (as allods) Castellet, Claverol, and Vall d'Escós.Kosto, 141. In September 1097 Raymond received the baiulia (protection) and receptum (payment) of Castellet from Ramon Mir and Ramon Arnau. Whether Castellet had been reclaimed by treaty or by force from Artau II is unknown.Kosto, 96. On another front Raymond was an adversary of the Ermengol III of Urgell, who had been his father's erstwhile enemy and was his father-in-law's suzerain and frequent rival. He was unable, however, to prevent the Conca de Tremp from being annexed by Urgell.

During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939, she spent time in Spanish waters, enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides of the conflict. Fame served in the Norwegian Campaign in 1940 before she was severely damaged when she ran aground in October. The ship was refloated several months later and spent a year and a half under repair. Fame was converted into an escort destroyer while under repair and was assigned to escort duties in the North Atlantic when the repairs were completed in mid-1942. She sank two German submarines before she was transferred back to British coastal waters in May 1944 to protect the build-up for Operation Overlord. Together with two other destroyers, she sank another German submarine that month and was reassigned to escort duties off the west coast of Scotland in July, where she remained until the war ended in May 1945. Fame remained on active duty until mid-1947 when she was paid off. The ship was recommissioned a year later and was then sold to the Dominican Republic in 1949. She was scrapped in 1968.

For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, they had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0.5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun. The F class was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for torpedoes.Whitley 1988, p. 103 One depth charge rack and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 38 shortly after the war began.Friedman 2009, p. 236 Wartime modifications Fame had her rear torpedo tubes replaced by a 12-pounder AA gun while under repair in mid-1940.English 1993, p. 77; Friedman 2009, p. 241 After running aground in October, she was converted into an escort destroyer. 'A' gun was replaced by a Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar and stowage for a total of 70 depth charges meant that 'Y' gun had to be removed to compensate for the weight. A Type 286 short-range surface search radar was fitted and a Type 271 target indication radar was installed above the bridge, replacing the director- control tower and rangefinder. The ship also received a HF/DF radio direction finder mounted on a pole mainmast. Her short-range AA armament was augmented by two Oerlikon guns on the wings of the ship's bridge and another pair were added on the quarterdeck. By June 1943, the .50-calibre machine guns had been replaced by a pair of Oerlikons, 'A' gun was reinstalled, and the Hedgehog mounted there was converted to a split installation. Later, her single mounts on the bridge wings were probably replaced by twin mounts.Friedman 2009, pp. 237, 242–44; Lenton 1998, p. 158 Construction and career Fame was ordered on 17 March 1933 from Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company, although her hull was sub-contracted to Vickers Armstrongs. She was laid down at their Walker, Newcastle upon Tyne shipyard on 5 July, launched on 28 June 1934, the same day as her sister ship, , and completed on 26 April 1935. The ship cost 244,216 pounds, excluding government-furnished equipment like the armament. Fame was initially assigned to the 6th Destroyer Flotilla (DF) of the Home Fleet, although she had to have her ammunition hoists modified at Devonport Royal Dockyard from 23 July to 28 August. The ship was then sent to reinforce the Mediterranean Fleet during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. Fame was refitted at Devonport from 20 July to 10 November 1936 before she began to enforce the arms embargo imposed on both sides in the Spanish Civil War by the Non- Intervention Committee until January 1937. She visited Aarhus, Denmark in July before returning to Spanish waters in August–September. The ship then returned home and spent the next two years with the 6th DF. The 6th DF was renumbered the 8th Destroyer Flotilla in April 1939, five months before the start of World War II. Fame remained assigned to it until July 1940, escorting the larger ships of the fleet.English 1993, pp. 75–77 In the Norwegian Campaign, she supported the Allied landings on 12–13 May at Bjerkvik during the Battle of Narvik. She continued to provide fire support during the battle for the rest of the month. During the nights of 30 and 31 May, the ship helped to evacuate troops from Bodø to Harstad and Borkenes to await further evacuation. Fame was one of the ships that escorted the troop ships evacuating the troops from the Narvik area on 7 and 8 June.Haarr 2010, pp. 246, 248, 254, 266, 300, 312 While searching for the damaged submarine on 6 July, she was badly damaged by bomb splinters and was under repair until 10 October. A week later, she ran aground, together with the destroyer , on the Northumberland coast while escorting the battleship . The ship was severely damaged and could not be refloated until 1 December. Fame received temporary repairs at Sunderland before she was towed to Chatham Royal Dockyard on 2 February 1941. Heavily overworked, the dockyard took nearly 18 months to repair the ship, although the decision to convert her into an escort destroyer during this time contributed to the time required.English 1993, pp. 77–78; Whitley 1988, p. 106 In September 1942, Fame finished her repairs and she was assigned to Escort Group B6 with her captain, Commander R. Heathcote, as the Group's senior officer. Her first Atlantic convoy action was with SC 104, a major convoy battle that saw the loss of 8 ships, with 2 warships damaged, and 2 U-boats destroyed, with 2 more damaged and forced to retire. Fames ASDIC located on 16 October and a shallow-set pattern of 10 depth charges forced her to the surface where she was rammed and sunk by Fame. The impact badly damaged the destroyer and she was forced to leave the convoy for repairs after rescuing 39 survivors.Blair 1998, pp. 39–40; English 1993, p. 77; Kemp 1997, p. 92 Her repairs were completed in December, and, while escorting Convoy ON 155, was dispatched to the aid of Convoy ON 154, which was under heavy attack. Heathcote was ordered to take command of the escort after the commander of Escort Group C1 collapsed from exhaustion after a five-day battle, during which ON 154 had lost 14 ships for one U-boat destroyed.Blair 1998, p. 134 In February 1943, Escort Group B6 was escorting Convoy ONS 165, which lost two ships for two U-boats destroyed.

Post war Fame began a refit at Leith in May 1945 that lasted until August. Unlike most of the prewar destroyers, she remained on active duty and was assigned to the Rosyth Escort Force until October when she was transferred to the Londonderry Training Flotilla. A month later, Fame became the senior officer's ship for the 3rd Flotilla at Londonderry Port. The ship was reduced to reserve in May 1947, but was reactivated a year later and refitted in June 1948. Together with the destroyer , she was sold on 4 February 1949 to the Dominican Republic for £190,000 for both ships, plus an additional £40,000 to refit each ship. By this time the ship carried a Type 291 air-warning radar and an American SG-1 surface-search radar. She was armed with three 4.7-inch guns, four Bofors light AA guns, one quadruple 21-inch torpedo mount, four depth charge throwers and two rails for 70 depth charges.English 1993, p. 142 Fame was renamed Generalisimo, but, after the death of Rafael Trujillo, the ship was renamed Sanchez in 1962.

The ship cost 245,728 pounds, excluding government-furnished equipment like the armament. Fearless was initially assigned to the 6th Destroyer Flotilla (DF) of the Home Fleet, but she was detached to reinforce the Mediterranean Fleet during the Second Italo- Abyssinian War from March to July 1936. The ship enforced the arms embargo imposed on both sides in the Spanish Civil War by the Non-Intervention Committee from November 1936 to March 1937. During this time, Fearless escorted the elderly liner , full of refugee children, from the Basque Country to Saint-Jean-de-Luz, France. She returned to Gibraltar for three-month detachments in August 1937, January 1938 and January 1939.

The convoy entered the Andfjorden on the morning of 15 April en route to make their landings at Harstad, but paused there after reports of a German submarine on the surface inside the Vågsfjorden were received. Fearless, the destroyer , and the trawler were ordered into the Vågsfjorden to investigate. Fearlesss ASDIC found a submarine and the ship dropped five depth charges near . The submarine commander, Lieutenant (Kapitänleutnant) Curt von Gossler, panicked and ordered his crew to surface and scuttle the boat. Machinegun fire from Fearless discouraged von Gossler from properly disposing of his secret documents and a boat from Brazen was able to retrieve many of them, including a map showing the location of all U-boats in Norwegian waters. Valiant, Fearless, Brazen and the destroyer were ordered to return to Scapa Flow that evening.Haarr 2010, pp. 198, 203–05 Beginning on 23 April, the ship was one of the escorts for the aircraft carriers and as they conducted air operations off the coast of Norway in support of Allied operations ashore.

A week later, she was escorting the battlecruiser and Ark Royal, together with her sisters and and the destroyer , from Scapa Flow to Gibraltar where they would form Force H.Rohwer, p. 29 Force H, 1940–41 On 3 July she took part in the attack on the French Fleet at Mers- el-Kébir (Operation Catapult). A month later the ship escorted Force H during Operation Hurry, a mission to fly off fighter aircraft for Malta and conduct an airstrike on Cagliari on 2 August.Rohwer, pp. 31, 34 Two days later, while returning to the UK, Fearless collided with the trawler Flying Wing and was repaired at the Barclay Curle shipyard in Scotstoun between 10 August and 11 October. On 30 October she was involved in another collision with at Greenock that fractured her stern. More repairs followed at Troon, and Fearless did not rejoin Force H at Gibraltar until 18 January 1941.English, p. 79 On 31 January, Force H departed Gibraltar to carry out Operation Picket, an unsuccessful night torpedo attack by eight of Ark Royals Fairey Swordfish on the Tirso Dam in Sardinia. The British ships returned to Gibraltar on 4 February and began preparing for Operation Grog, a naval bombardment of Genoa, that was successfully carried out five days later.Admiralty Historical Section, pp. 48–53 At the end of March, together with the light cruiser and three other destroyers, the ship attempted to intercept a Vichy French convoy that included the freighter , supposedly laden with of rubber, which had already been unloaded. Fearless was ordered to board and capture Bangkok, but she was thwarted by gunfire from a coast-defence battery off the port of Nemours, Algeria. A few days later, Fearless and four other destroyers escorted Sheffield, the battlecruiser , and Ark Royal in Operation Winch, which delivered 12 Hurricane fighters to Malta.English, p. 79; Rohwer, pp. 66–67 In early May she was part of the destroyer screen with five other destroyers for the battleship , and the light cruisers , and which were joining the Mediterranean Fleet. This was part of Operation Tiger which included a supply convoy taking tanks to the Middle East and the transfer of warships. Fearless and her sisters had their Two-Speed Destroyer Sweep (TSDS) minesweeping gear rigged to allow them to serve as a fast minesweepers en route to Malta. Despite this, one merchant ship was sunk by mines and another damaged. The ship escorted another flying-off mission to Malta on 14 June; two days later, after German blockade runners reached France, Force H sortied into the Atlantic on a failed search for more blockade runners. Together with her sisters Faulknor, , and Foxhound, Fearless helped to sink on 18 June. Four days later, the 8th DF was tasked to intercept a German supply ship spotted heading towards the French coast. The next day they intercepted which was scuttled by her crew upon the approach of the British ships. They rescued 78 British POWs taken from ships sunk by German raiders as well as the crew.English, p. 79; Rohwer, p. 74, 77–78 Presumably the burning Fearless, 23 July 1941 Another Malta convoy (Operation Substance) was conducted in mid- July, heavily escorted by Force H and elements of the Home Fleet. Fearless was torpedoed by an Italian Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 bomber at 09:45 on 23 July. The detonation killed 27 and wounded 11 of her crew, set the aft oil tank on fire, and knocked out all power and the port propeller shaft. Forester closed to render assistance, but Fearless could not be saved under the circumstances. Her crew were taken off by her sister, which then sank the wrecked and burning ship with torpedoes at 10:57,English, p. 79; Evans, pp. 71–72; Kemp, p. 151 about north-north-east of Bône, Algeria, in position .

Although assigned to the Home Fleet upon completion, the ship was attached to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1935–36 during the Abyssinia Crisis. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–39, she spent much time in Spanish waters, enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides of the conflict. Several weeks after the start of the Second World War in September 1939, Firedrake helped to sink a German submarine and took part in the Norwegian Campaign in early 1940. She was sent to Gibraltar in mid-1940 and formed part of Force H where she escorted many Malta convoys in the Mediterranean and helped to sink an Italian submarine. Firedrake participated in the Battle of Cape Spartivento and screened the capital ships of Force H as they bombarded Genoa before she was damaged by an Italian bomb in mid-1941. After her repairs were completed the ship became a convoy escort in the Atlantic at the beginning of 1942. Firedrake was torpedoed and sunk by a German U-boat in late 1942 with the loss of most of her crew. Description The F-class ships were repeats of the preceding E-class. They displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ships had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . They were powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by three Admiralty three-drum boilers. The turbines developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . Firedrake barely exceeded her designed speed during her sea trials.March, p. 296 She carried a maximum of of fuel oil that gave her a range of at . The ships' complement was 145 officers and ratings.Lenton, p. 156 The ships mounted four 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark IX guns in single mounts, designated 'A', 'B', 'X', and 'Y' in sequence from front to rear. For anti- aircraft (AA) defence, they had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0.5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun. The F class was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for torpedoes.Whitley, p. 103 One depth charge rack and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began.English, p. 141 Wartime modifications By October 1940, Firedrake had her rear torpedo tube mount replaced by a 12-pounder AA gun. While the ship was under repair in late 1941, 'Y' gun had was removed to allow a total of 70 depth charges to be stowed aboard. Several other changes also probably happened during this refit, notably two single Oerlikon light AA guns were installed abreast the bridge and a Type 286 short-range surface search radar was fitted as was a HF/DF radio direction finder mounted on a pole mainmast.Friedman, pp. 241, 243 Construction and career Firedrake, the sixth ship of her name in the Royal Navy,Colledge, p. 126 was built by Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company, Wallsend, although her hull was sub-contracted to Vickers Armstrongs. She was laid down at their Walker, Newcastle upon Tyne shipyard on 5 July, launched on 28 June 1934, the same day as her sister ship, , and completed on 30 April 1935. The ship cost 243,966 pounds, excluding government-furnished equipment like the armament. Firedrake was initially assigned to the 6th Destroyer Flotilla (DF) of the Home Fleet, but was sent to reinforce the Mediterranean Fleet, together with most of her sisters, during the Abyssinian crisis, in September and remained there until December. Firedrake was refitted at Gibraltar from 14 December 1935 to 11 February 1936. She briefly returned home to give leave to the crew later that month, but she returned to the Mediterranean in March and remained there until July when she began a refit at Sheerness Dockyard.English, pp. 75–76, 79–80 Upon its completion on 30 September, the ship returned to the Mediterranean and began to enforce the arms embargo imposed on both sides in the Spanish Civil War by the Non- Intervention Committee until June 1937. On 23 April 1937, Firedrake, together with the battlecruiser , escorted a British merchantman into Bilbao harbour despite the presence of the Nationalist cruiser that attempted to blockade the port. Firedrake returned to Gibraltar in September and resumed patrols in Spanish waters until November when she began another refit at Sheerness that lasted until 30 December. The ship spent another two months at Gibraltar between January and March 1938 and then patrolled the Spanish coastline in the Bay of Biscay a year later. The 6th DF was renumbered the 8th Destroyer Flotilla in April 1939, five months before the start of World War II. Firedrake remained assigned to it until June 1940, escorting the larger ships of the fleet.English, p. 80 World War II In September 1939 Firedrake was assigned to the Home Fleet and based at Scapa Flow. In the first month of hostilities she was part of an anti-submarine hunting group centred on the aircraft carrier . On 14 September, the carrier was unsuccessfully attacked by the . Firedrake, in company with her sisters and , counter-attacked and sank U-39 north-west of Ireland. On 5 October, the ship rescued survivors from the small freighter . In February 1940, she was one of the escorts for Convoy TC 3 carrying troops from Canada to the UK.Smith, pp. 30, 35 Firedrake was slightly damaged going alongside the destroyer at Invergordon on 28 March and was repaired between 2 and 26 April at Cardiff, Wales. In the Norwegian Campaign, she supported the Allied landings on 12–13 May at Bjerkvik during the Battle of Narvik. The ship continued to provide fire support during the battle for the rest of the month. During the nights of 30 and 31 May, Firedrake helped to evacuate troops from Bodø to Harstad and Borkenes to await further evacuation. She was one of the ships that escorted the troop ships evacuating the troops from the Narvik area on 7 and 8 June.Haarr, pp. 266, 269, 300, 312 She was slightly damaged by splinters during an aerial attack on 23 May and again on 12 June when her port steering motor and 'A' gun were knocked out of action; her repairs were completed eight days later. Firedrake was briefly assigned to the 4th Destroyer Flotilla until she rejoined the 8th DF in mid-August as they escorted the battleship and the new carrier from the UK to Gibraltar, arriving on 29 August. The next day, Fury and Force H covered the passage of Valiant and Illustrious through the Western Mediterranean to rendezvous with the Mediterranean Fleet (Operation Hats).Rohwer, p. 37–38 On 18 October, she sank the east of Gibraltar together with the destroyer and two Saro London flying boats of 202 Squadron RAF. A boarding party captured cipher and operational documents aboard the boat which led to the sinking of the two days later. Between them, the two destroyers rescued 5 officers and 43 ratings.Admiralty Historical Section 2002, Vol. I, p. 70; Rohwer, p. 45 Firedrake escorted the carriers and Ark Royal during Operations Coat and White in November as they flew off aircraft for Malta. The ship escorted Force F to Malta during Operation Collar later in the month and participated in the inconclusive Battle of Cape Spartivento on 27 November, where she was part of the screen for the battlecruiser and the battleship .Rohwer, pp. 47, 49–50; Smith, pp. 70–75 On 1 January 1941, Firedrake was one of the ships that intercepted a Vichy French convoy off Mellila, Morocco and seized all four merchant ships of the convoy.Osborne, p. 26 Later that month, she was involved in Operation Excess. On 31 January 1941, Force H departed Gibraltar to carry out Operation Picket, an unsuccessful night torpedo attack by eight of Ark Royals Fairey Swordfish on the Tirso Dam in Sardinia. The British ships returned to Gibraltar on 4 February and began preparing for Operation Grog, a naval bombardment of Genoa, that was successfully carried out five days later. The destroyer accidentally ran aground in fog near Gibraltar on 1 March and received preliminary repairs there until 21 April. Final repairs were completed at Chatham Royal Dockyard on 19 June and she rejoined the 8th DF back at Gibraltar shortly afterwards.Admiralty Historical Section 2002, Vol. II, pp. 48–53; English, p. 80 During Operation Substance, Firedrake and Foxhound were each leading a column of the convoy, streaming their TSDS minesweeps, through the Sicilian Narrows on 23 July when an Italian bomb near missed Firedrake and detonated off her port side. The shockwave blew in the plating over No. 1 boiler room and disabled her so that she had to be towed back to Gibraltar by the destroyer . Temporary repairs were made in Gibraltar and she was transferred to the Boston Navy Yard for repair on 23 September. Firedrake exchanged one 4.7-inch gun for additional depth charges while under repair to better suit her new role as a convoy escort.English, p. 80; Smith, p. 108 After escorting Convoy NA 2 to the UK in January 1942, the ship was assigned to Escort Group B7 of the Mid-Ocean Escort Force. While escorting Convoy ON(S) 94 in May, the escorts drove off . Firedrake received repairs in April on the Clyde and August in Belfast. She rescued survivors from the torpedoed merchantman on 26 September. Two months later, the ship was detached to reinforce the escort for Convoy ON 144 on 18 November and helped to prevent any further losses to the convoy. On 16 December, while escorting Convoy ON 153, Firedrake was torpedoed by at 19:11. She broke in two; the bow section sinking immediately at coordinates , but the stern stayed afloat until 00:45. The corvette picked up 26 survivors, but the rest of her crew of 140 men were lost.English, p. 80; Rohwer, pp. 140, 165, 212, 219The rescue of the survivors is described on pages 76/77 in the autobiography of John Treasure Jones, who was the Captain of HMS Sunflower References Bibliography    * External links * HMS Firedrake Association website * HMS Firedrake at Naval-History.net E and F-class destroyers of the Royal Navy Ships built on the River Tyne 1934 ships World War II destroyers of the United Kingdom Ships sunk by German submarines in World War II Maritime incidents in December 1942 World War II shipwrecks in the Atlantic Ocean ","title":"HMS Firedrake (H79)"},{"id":"14445256","text":"Thomas Gumpert (* 11 December 1952 in Lauchhammer, Bezirk Cottbus) is a German actor.

During this time the ship helped to sink another German submarine. Converted into an escort destroyer midway through the war, Forester was assigned to escort convoys to Russia for the next year and a half and then in the North Atlantic until mid-1944. The ship helped to sink another German submarine before she was transferred to the English Channel to protect convoys during the Normandy landings. Forester assisted in sinking a German submarine before returning to the North Atlantic for a few months.

In April–June 1943, she was converted into an escort destroyer. A Type 286 short-range surface search radar was fitted and a Type 271 target indication radar was installed above the bridge, replacing the director-control tower and rangefinder. The ship also received a HF/DF radio direction finder mounted on a pole mainmast. Her short-range AA armament was augmented by four Oerlikon guns and the .50-calibre machine guns were replaced by a pair of Oerlikons. A split Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar was installed abreast 'A' gun and stowage for a total of 70 depth charges meant that 'Y' gun and the 12-pounder had to be removed to compensate for their weight. By 1944 the ship carried 115 depth charges.English, p. 83; Friedman, pp. 237, 241–44; Lenton, p. 158; March, p. 298 Construction and career Forester was built by J. Samuel White at its Cowes shipyard under the 1932 Naval Programme. The ship was laid down on 15 May 1933, launched on 28 June 1934,English, pp. 75–76 as the eleventh ship to carry the name,Colledge, p. 130 and completed on 19 April 1935. The ship cost 248,898 pounds, excluding Admiralty supplied equipment such as armaments and communications sets. Forester was initially assigned to the 6th Destroyer Flotilla (DF) of the Home Fleet, but was sent to reinforce the Mediterranean Fleet, together with most of her sister ships, during the Abyssinian crisis in June and remained here until February 1936. She was deployed to Gibraltar in September–October 1937 during the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939. The ship then returned home and spent the next two years with the 6th DF. The flotilla was renumbered the 8th Destroyer Flotilla in April 1939, five months before the start of World War II.

The following day, Forester and three of her sisters sank the and then resumed their normal escort duties.English, p. 82; Rohwer, p. 4 On 11 February 1940, she helped to tow the damaged tanker to port after she was torpedoed by .English, p. 82 Two months later, Forester escorted the battleship during the Second Battle of Narvik on 13 April and engaged several German destroyers. Only lightly damaged herself, she escorted the badly damaged destroyer to Skjelfjord for temporary repairs after the battle. Two days later, Forester was one of the screen for the battleship and the battlecruiser as they sailed back to Scapa Flow to refuel.Haarr (2009), pp. 359–72 In early June, the ship was escorting the battlecruiser and two cruisers as they searched for illusory German commerce raiders off Iceland; they were recalled to Norwegian waters on 9 June after the Germans launched Operation Juno, an attack on the Allied convoys evacuating Norway, but the Germans had already returned to base by the time the ships arrived.Haarr (2010), p. 348; Rohwer, p. 25 Force H In late June, the 8th DF was ordered to Gibraltar where they were to form the escorts for Force H. A few days later, they participated in the attack on Mers-el-Kébir against the Vichy French ships stationed there. During Operation MA 5, a planned air attack on Italian airfields in Sardinia, the destroyer was torpedoed by the on 11 July after the attack had been cancelled due to lack of surprise.Rohwer, pp. 31–32 The torpedo blew a large hole in the ship, but the British tried to salvage her. Despite their efforts, she foundered later that morning after Forester and the flotilla leader took off the survivors.Smith, p. 61 A month later Forester was one of the escorts for Force H during Operation Hurry, a mission to fly off fighter aircraft for Malta and conduct an airstrike on Cagliari on 2 August. On 13 September, Force H rendezvoused with a convoy that was carrying troops intended to capture Dakar from the Vichy French. Ten days later, they attacked Dakar, but were driven off by the Vichy French defences. In early October, Forester escorted a troop convoy from Freetown, Sierra Leone, to French Cameroon.Rohwer, pp. 34, 38, 42–43 She then returned to Gibraltar and escorted the aircraft carriers and during Operations Coat and White in November.Rohwer, pp. 47, 49 On 21 November, the light cruiser , Forester and Faulknor intercepted the Vichy French blockade runner and escorted her to Gibraltar.Smith, p. 69 The ship escorted Force F to Malta during Operation Collar later in the month and participated in the inconclusive Battle of Cape Spartivento on 27 November. In early January, she screened Force H during Operation ExcessRohwer, pp. 49–50, 54 and rescued the crew of a shot-down Italian bomber on 9 January.Smith, p. 78 Later that month, Forester and Faulknor temporarily relieved some of the escorts for Convoy WS 5B bound for Egypt via the Cape of Good Hope and stayed with the convoy to Freetown. Before arriving there on 26 January, they were detached from Force H to reinforce the Freetown Escort Force. This did not last long as they were ordered to escort Convoy SL 67 and the battleship en route back to Gibraltar. On 7 March, the German battleships and spotted the convoy, but Admiral Günther Lütjens declined to attack when Malaya was spotted. Their report caused attacks by two U-boats that sank five ships from the convoy before Force H rendezvoused with it three days later.Rohwer, p. 62 The following month Forester was part of the escort screen, with five other destroyers, for the battleship and the light cruisers , and which were joining the Mediterranean Fleet. This was part of Operation Tiger which included a supply convoy taking tanks to Egypt and the transfer of warships to and from the Mediterranean Fleet. Forester and her sisters had their Two-Speed Destroyer Sweep (TSDS) minesweeping gear rigged to allow them to serve as a fast minesweepers en route to Malta. Despite this, one merchant ship was sunk by mines and another damaged.Rohwer, p. 72 Later that month, she participated in Operation Splice, another mission in which the carriers Ark Royal and flew off fighters for Malta.Smith, p. 96 Force H was ordered to join the escort of Convoy WS 8B in the North Atlantic on 24 May, after the Battle of the Denmark Strait on 23 May, but they were directed to search for the and the heavy cruiser on 25 May. Heavy seas increased fuel consumption for all of the escorts and Forester was forced to return to Gibraltar to refuel later that day before rejoining the capital ships of Force H on 29 May, after Bismarck had been tracked down and sunk. In early June the destroyer participated in two more aircraft delivery missions to Malta (Operations Rocket and Tracer). While returning to Gibraltar to refuel, after covering another WS convoy west of Gibraltar, she participated in the sinking of , together with four of her sisters on 18 June. In late June, Forester screened Ark Royal and Furious as they flew off more fighters for Malta in Operation Railway.Smith, pp. 96–106 On 23 July, during a Malta supply convoy (Operation Substance), Forester rescued survivors from her sister , which had been attacked by Italian torpedo-bombers, and then sank the wrecked and burning ship with torpedoes. A week later she screened the capital ships of Force H as they covered another Malta convoy (Operation Style). Over the next several months, Forester participated in Operation Halberd, another Malta convoy and escorted Ark Royal and Furious as they made several trips to fly off aircraft for Malta (Operations Status, Status II and Callboy). Upon her return to the UK on 26 October, the destroyer was briefly assigned to the 11th Escort Group before rejoining the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow in November. She then began a lengthy refit and work up that lasted until April 1942. Russian convoys, 1942 In mid-April, Forester was part of the close cover for Convoy PQ 14 to Murmansk.Rohwer, p. 158 On 28 April, Forester joined the escort of returning Convoy QP 11, and two days later, when the light cruiser was torpedoed, she and her sister Foresight were detached to escort the crippled cruiser back to Murmansk. On 1 May Edinburgh and her escorts were attacked by the German destroyers , and . Forester fired her torpedoes at Z25, but was almost simultaneously hit by three shells. They disabled 'B' and 'X' guns and the hit in No. 1 boiler room temporarily disabled her propulsion machinery. Twelve crewmen were killed, including her captain, and nine were wounded. Foresight was also temporarily disabled and the Germans put another torpedo into Edinburgh, crippling her, before breaking off the engagement to rescue the crew of the crippled Z7 Hermann Schoemann. The two British destroyers took off the survivors from the cruiser and Foresight scuttled the cruiser with a torpedo before heading back to Murmansk for temporary repairs.Admiralty Historical Section, pp. 39–43 She sailed on 13 May with Foresight and the destroyers and as escorts for the light cruiser that had been damaged while escorting Convoy PQ 13. The next day the ships came under heavy air attack, and Trinidad was further damaged and set on fire. Forester took off the wounded and other survivors, and Trinidad was sunk by Matchless. Forester arrived at Scapa Flow on 18 May and immediately took passage to a shipyard on the Tyne for repairs that lasted until October. That month, she rejoined the 8th DF and resumed escorting convoys to Russia until April 1943. The ship was then refitted at Leith until June. Later service, 1943–45 In June 1943, Forester joined the 1st Canadian Escort Group for Atlantic convoy duty. On 10 March 1944, while escorting Convoy SC 154, Forester, along with the destroyer HMCS St. Laurent, the frigate and the corvette sank the . The ship remained on convoy duty in the North Atlantic until 29 May when she was transferred to the English Channel to support the Normandy landings for the next several months. On 20 August, Forester, and the destroyers and sank the off Beachy Head. The next day she engaged and drove off E-boats with the destroyers and while defending a Channel coastal convoy. In October, the ship was transferred to the 14th Escort Group at Londonderry Port for convoy defence. On 1 December 1944 Forester arrived at Liverpool for repairs, returning to service in May 1945, and joining the Rosyth Escort Force. Forester was paid off in August and reduced to reserve at Dartmouth on 2 November. She was turned over to the British Iron & Steel Corporation on 22 January 1946 for disposal and arrived at Rosyth to be broken up for scrap on 26 February by Metal Industries, Limited.

Although she was assigned to the Home Fleet upon completion, the ship was detached to the Mediterranean Fleet to enforce the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides during the Spanish Civil War of 1936–39. Several weeks after the start of the Second World War in September 1939, Fortune helped to sink a German submarine. The ship escorted the larger ships of the fleet during the early stages of World War II and played a minor role in the Norwegian Campaign of 1940. Fortune was sent to Gibraltar in mid-1940 and formed part of Force H where she participated in the Battle of Dakar against the Vichy French. The ship escorted numerous convoys to Malta in 1940–41 until she was badly damaged by Italian bombers in mid-1941. After repairs were completed, Fortune was briefly assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet before she was transferred to the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean in early 1942. The ship screened an aircraft carrier during the Battle of Madagascar later that year and was assigned to convoy escort duties for the rest of 1942 and early 1943. She returned home in February to begin conversion into an escort destroyer. The ship was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) when it was completed in mid-1943 and renamed HMCS Saskatchewan. The ship spent the next year escorting convoys in the North Atlantic before she was transferred to the English Channel to defend convoys during the Normandy landings in June 1944. Saskatchewan engaged some German patrol boats the following month and was lightly damaged. She was sent to Canada for repairs and a general refit and did not return to the UK until January 1945. The ship resumed her former duties until the end of the war in May and then ferried troops back to Canada for several months. Saskatchewan was judged surplus later that year and was sold for scrap, in early 1946. Description The F-class ships were repeats of the preceding E class.

For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, they had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0.5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun. The F class was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for torpedoes.Whitley, p. 103 One depth charge rack and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began.English, p. 141 Wartime modifications Fortune had her rear torpedo tubes replaced by a 12-pounder (76 mm) AA gun by April 1941. In February–May 1943, she was converted into an escort destroyer. A Type 286 short-range surface search radar was fitted and a Type 271 target indication radar was installed above the bridge, replacing the director-control tower and rangefinder. The ship also received a HF/DF radio direction finder mounted on a pole mainmast. Her short-range AA armament was augmented by four Oerlikon guns and the .50-calibre machine guns were replaced by a pair of Oerlikons. A split Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar was installed abreast 'A' gun and stowage for a total of 70 depth charges meant that 'Y' gun, the 12-pounder and her Two-Speed Destroyer Sweep (TSDS) minesweeping gear had to be removed to compensate for their weight.Friedman, pp. 237, 241–44; Lenton, p. 158; March, p. 298 Construction and career Fortune, the 23rd ship of that name in the Royal Navy,Colledge, pp. 131–32 was laid down by John Brown & Company at their Clydebank shipyard on 27 July 1933. She was launched on 29 August 1934 and completed on 27 April 1935. The ship cost 247,564 pounds, excluding government-furnished equipment like the armament. Fortune was initially assigned to the 6th Destroyer Flotilla (DF) of the Home Fleet, but detached to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1937 to enforce the arms embargo imposed on both sides in the Spanish Civil War by the Non-Intervention Committee. The 6th DF was renumbered the 8th Destroyer Flotilla in April 1939, five months before the start of World War II.English, pp. 75–76, 83 After a pair of fishing trawlers were sunk by a submarine off the Hebrides after the start of World War II in September 1939, the 6th and 8th DFs were ordered to sweep the area on 19 September. The following day, Fortune and three of her sister ships sank the and then resumed their normal escort duties.English, p. 83; Rohwer, p. 4 In February 1940, she was one of the escorts for Convoy TC 3 carrying troops from Canada to the UK.Smith, p. 35 In the following month, while escorting units of the Home Fleet north-west of Shetland on 20 March, she was credited with sinking ,English, p. 83 although later research suggests that the submarine was destroyed in a minefield which had been laid by other British destroyers on 13 March. During the Norwegian Campaign, Fortune played a minor role escorting the oiler RFA War Pindari to Namsos on 15 April.Haarr, p. 111 On 25 April, she ferried part of the 2nd Battalion, the South Wales Borderers to Bogen and Lenvik.Smith, pp. 51–52 A few days later the ship escorted the aircraft carriers Ark Royal and Glorious and the battleship off the coast of Norway.Haarr, pp. 146, 150 In early May, she escorted two cruisers ferrying troops to occupy Iceland. In August, Fortune was briefly transferred to the 4th DF and on 10 August, the ship rescued survivors from the torpedoed armed merchant cruiser Transylvania. Later in the month, she escorted a convoy to Gibraltar and was transferred to Force H on the 28th.English, p. 83; Rohwer, p. 37 Force H, 1940–41 During Operation Hats, the ship escorted Force H while the carriers and Ark Royal flew off fighter aircraft for Malta and conducted an airstrike on Cagliari on 2 August.Smith, p. 64 On 13 September, Force H rendezvoused with a convoy that was carrying troops intended to capture Dakar from the Vichy French. Ten days later, they attacked Dakar where Fortune sank the on the 24th, rescuing 76 of the crew.English, p. 83; Rohwer, pp. 38, 42 In November, the ship escorted the carriers during Operations Coat and White as they flew off fighters for Malta and attacked the airfield at Elmas, Sardinia. During the former operation, Fortune was detached and escorted Force F to Malta, streaming her TSDS gear at the head of the convoy to serve as a fast minesweeper.Smith, pp. 68–69 In early January 1941, she participated in Operation Excess.Smith, p. 78 Three months later, Fortune and four other destroyers escorted the light cruiser , the battlecruiser , and Ark Royal in Operation Winch, which delivered a dozen Hurricane fighters to Malta.Rohwer, p. 67 Beginning on 24 April, Fortune and Force H covered Argus flying off more Hurricanes as well as the destroyers of the 5th Destroyer Flotilla sailing to Malta in Operation Dunlop. In early May she was part of the destroyer screen with five other destroyers for the battleship , and the light cruisers , and which were joining the Mediterranean Fleet. This was part of Operation Tiger which included a supply convoy taking tanks to the Middle East and the transfer of warships. Fortune and her sisters had their TSDS gear deployed en route to Malta. Despite this, one merchant ship was sunk by mines and another damaged. During the return voyage on 10 May, the ship was badly damaged by a bomb that detonated nearby. The shockwave ruptured the hull, knocked out her engines, slightly bent her propeller shafts, and caused a lot of flooding. Her crew jettisoned nearly of topweight and she was able to reach a speed of en route to Gibraltar for temporary repairs. Fortune then sailed to Chatham Royal Dockyard for permanent repairs that lasted until November.English, p. 84; Rohwer, p. 72; Smith, pp. 90–96 Although she returned to Gibraltar that same month, the ship did not become fully operational and mechanical problems restricted her to local duties until February 1942. On the 9th of that month, Fortune escorted the light cruiser to Malta and then escorted her and a convoy including the transport to Alexandria, Egypt where they arrived on the 17th. She was transferred to the 2nd DF of the Eastern Fleet and arrived at Trincomalee, Ceylon on 7 March. Admiral James Somerville, commander of the fleet, assigned her to screen the slow ships of Force B as he organised his forces in anticipation of the Japanese Indian Ocean Raid. On 4 April, the ship rescued 88 survivors from the torpedoed freighter . Fortune returned to the Mediterranean to participate in Operation Vigorous, a convoy from Alexandria to Malta, in June. After the ship returned to the Indian Ocean, she was assigned to the 12th DF and escorted the carrier when that ship supported operations on Madagascar in September. Fortune spent the rest of the year and the first part of 1943 escorting convoys in the Indian Ocean until she was sent home in February for conversion into an escort destroyer.English, p. 84; Rohwer, pp. 142–43, 154, 173, 195 HMCS Saskatchewan Upon completion of the conversion, the ship was transferred to the RCN on 31 May, renamed Saskatchewan, and then gifted to Canada on 15 June 1943. She was assigned to Escort Group C3, of the Mid-Ocean Escort Force, as the \\"Senior Officer's\\" ship, which was based in Londonderry Port. The ship remained with the group until she was transferred to the 12th Escort Group in May 1944 where she later patrolled the western entrance to the English Channel after the Normandy landings to protect shipping from German attacks.English, p. 84; MacPherson & Barrie, p. 53 Together with the destroyers Qu'Appelle, Skeena, and Restigouche, Saskatchewan attacked three German patrol boats off Brest on the night of 5–6 July, with sinking the German patrol boat V715. Saskatchewan was lightly damaged and suffered one man dead and four wounded. The ship was sent to Canada for a refit and arrived at Halifax on 6 August. She began her refit at Shelburne, Nova Scotia which lasted until November. More work was required at St. John's, Newfoundland and Saskatchewan did not return to Britain until January 1945.English, p. 84; Rohwer, p. 340 Upon her arrival, she was assigned first to the 14th Escort Group and then the 11th Escort Group. With the end of the war on 9 May, the ship ferried Canadian troops back home, arriving on 30 May. She made four voyages between St John's and Quebec City before being declared surplus on 23 September, although the ship was not paid off until 28 January 1946 at Sydney, Nova Scotia. Saskatchewan was sold later that year to the International Iron & Metal Co. for scrap.

The ship was sent to Gibraltar in mid-1940 and formed part of Force H where she participated in the attack on Mers-el-Kébir. Foxhound escorted the aircraft carriers of Force H as they flew off aircraft for Malta and covered convoys resupplying and reinforcing the island until late 1941. During this time the ship helped to sink another German submarine. In December, she was briefly transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet where she escorted several convoys to Malta from the Eastern Mediterranean. Foxhound was transferred to the Eastern Fleet in early 1942 and was then assigned to convoy escort duties off South Africa and then in West Africa until mid-1943 when she was converted into an escort destroyer. When the conversion was completed in early 1944, the ship was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy and renamed HMCS Qu'Appelle. She was assigned escort duties in the Western Approaches for several months before the ship was transferred to the English Channel to protect convoys during the Normandy landings. Qu'Appelle engaged German surface ships several times before she was sent to Iceland for more convoy escort work in October. The ship received a lengthy refit in Canada at the end of the year that was not completed until mid-1945.

While the ship was under repair in late 1941, her existing director-control tower and rangefinder above the bridge was replaced by a new director with a Type 285 gunnery radar mounted on its roof. These fed target data to the new Fuze-Keeping Clock, an analogue fire-control system that calculated the gunnery information for the guns. The ship also received a HF/DF radio direction finder at the top of her foremast. Her short-range AA armament was augmented by two Oerlikon guns on the wings of the ship's bridge, a pair on the enlarged searchlight platform and, probably, another pair were added on the quarterdeck.Friedman, pp. 240–41 When she was converted into an escort destroyer in late 1943, 'B' gun was replaced by a Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar and stowage was increased for a total of 70 depth charges which meant that 'Y' gun and the 12-pounder AA gun had to be removed to compensate for the weight. A Type 271 target-indication radar replaced the director. It is likely that the Vickers guns were replaced by the Oerlikons from the quarterdeck at this time. Construction and career Foxhound, the seventh ship of that name in the Royal Navy,Colledge, p. 133 was laid down by John Brown & Company at their Clydebank shipyard on 15 August 1933. She was launched on 12 October 1934 and completed on 21 June 1935. The ship cost 247,234 pounds, excluding government-furnished equipment like the armament. Foxhound was initially assigned to the 6th Destroyer Flotilla (DF) of the Home Fleet, but often detached to the Mediterranean Fleet to enforce the arms embargo imposed on both sides in the Spanish Civil War by the Non- Intervention Committee. Between November 1936 and 13 February 1937, the ship was based in Gibraltar except for a brief refit at Sheerness Dockyard in January. She patrolled the Spanish ports on the Bay of Biscay in May–June and August–October before returning home for a refit at Chatham Dockyard from 27 October to 30 December. During her service in northern Spanish waters, Foxhound was accidentally engaged and straddled by the Spanish nationalist minelayer Jupiter while on station off Gijon in August.Foreign Office (1937), p. 545 She then returned to the Mediterranean to patrol the area between Gibraltar and Oran, French Algeria from January to March 1938. On 22 September, the ship collided with the submarine , damaging one of her propellers. She was repaired at Sheerness from 10 November to 12 December. Foxhound remained in home waters for the rest of 1938–39. The 6th DF was renumbered the 8th Destroyer Flotilla in April 1939, five months before the start of World War II.English, pp. 75–76, 85 In September 1939, Foxhound was assigned to the Home Fleet and based at Scapa Flow. In the first month of hostilities she was part of an anti-submarine hunting group centred on the aircraft carrier . On 14 September, the carrier was unsuccessfully attacked by the . Foxhound, in company with her sisters and , counter-attacked and sank U-39 north-west of Ireland.English, p. 85 In February 1940, she was one of the escorts for Convoy TC 3 carrying troops from Canada to the UK.Smith, p. 35 Later that month the ship rescued the survivors of the torpedoed freighter on 11 February. A map of the Ofotfjord During the Second Battle of Narvik, Foxhound and the destroyers and streamed their TSDS minesweeping gear in advance of the battleship and her escort as they steamed up the Vestfjord to engage the remaining German destroyers on 13 April. The ship and four other British destroyers pursued the remaining German ships into the Rombaksfjorden (the easternmost branch of the Ofotfjord), east of Narvik, where the lack of ammunition had forced the German ships to retreat. During the battle, Foxhound rescued two officers and nine ratings from the destroyer .Haar 2009, pp. 357–58, 362–5 During May, she escorted troop convoys to Iceland as they occupied the island. In early June, the ship was escorting the battlecruiser and two cruisers as they searched for illusory German commerce raiders off Iceland; they were recalled to Norwegian waters on 9 June after the Germans launched Operation Juno, an attack on the Allied convoys evacuating Norway, but the Germans had already returned to base by the time the ships arrived.Haarr 2010, p. 348; Rohwer, p. 25 Later, Foxhound escorted Ark Royal and the battlecruiser , together with her sisters Faulknor and and the destroyer , from Scapa Flow to Gibraltar where they would form Force H.Rohwer, p. 29 Force H, 1940–41 On the morning of 3 July, she ferried Captain Cedric Holland, the emissary of Admiral James Somerville, commander of Force H, to meet with Admiral Marcel-Bruno Gensoul, commander of the Vichy French forces at Mers-el-Kébir, Algeria. Holland was to deliver an ultimatum regarding the disposition of the French ships there to ensure that they could not fall into the hands of the Germans. Gensoul initially refused to meet with such a low-ranking envoy, but later relented and negotiations were underway that afternoon to disarm the French ships in place when the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, ordered the talks terminated to forestall the impending arrival of French reinforcements. The British opened fire a half- hour later,Lasterle, pp. 840–43 including Foxhound. A month later the ship escorted Force H during Operation Hurry, a mission to fly off fighter aircraft for Malta and conduct an airstrike on Cagliari on 2 August.Rohwer, pp. 31, 34 Shortly afterwards, she escorted Hood back home and began a refit at Sheerness that lasted until October.English, p. 85; Smith, pp. 63–64 Foxhound then returned to Gibraltar and escorted the aircraft carriers and Ark Royal during Operations Coat and White in November.Rohwer, pp. 47, 49 In between sorties into the Mediterranean, the ship escorted convoys between Gibraltar and West Africa. In early January 1941, she was involved in Operation Excess.Smith, p. 78 On 31 January, Force H, including Foxhound, departed Gibraltar to carry out Operation Picket, an unsuccessful night torpedo attack by eight of Ark Royals Fairey Swordfish on the Tirso Dam in Sardinia. The British ships returned to Gibraltar on 4 February and began preparing for Operation Grog, a naval bombardment of Genoa, that was successfully carried out five days later.Admiralty Historical Section, pp. 48–53 On 7 April, Foxhound was escorting Convoy WS 7 off the coast of Sierra Leone, West Africa, when she rescued three seamen. They were survivors from the cargo liner , which had been sunk a week earlier. In mid-May, she participated in Operation Splice, another mission in which the carriers Ark Royal and flew off fighters for Malta.Smith, p. 96 Force H was ordered to join the escort of Convoy WS 8B in the North Atlantic on 24 May, a day after the Battle of the Denmark Strait, but they were directed to search for the and the heavy cruiser on the 25th. Heavy seas increased fuel consumption for all of the escorts and Foxhound was forced to return to Gibraltar to refuel later that day before rejoining the capital ships of Force H on the 29th, after Bismarck had been tracked down and sunk. The destroyer screened another flying-off mission to Malta on 14 June; two days later, after German blockade runners reached France, Force H sortied into the Atlantic on a failed search for more blockade runners. Together with her sisters Faulknor, Fearless, and , Foxhound helped to sink the on 18 June. Four days later, the 8th DF was tasked to intercept a German supply ship spotted heading towards the French coast. The next day they intercepted which was scuttled by her crew upon the approach of the British ships. They rescued 78 British POWs taken from ships sunk by German raiders and the crew. In late June, Foxhound screened Ark Royal and Furious as they flew off more fighters for Malta in Operation Railway.Smith, pp. 97, 99–100, 102–03, 106 During Operation Substance, Firedrake and Foxhound were each leading a column of the convoy, streaming their TSDS minesweeps, through the Sicilian Narrows on 23 July when an Italian bomb near missed Firedrake and disabled her so that she had to be towed back to Gibraltar. The bulk of the convoy reached Malta the next day before the escorts rejoined Force H.Admiralty Historical Section, pp. 147–48 A week later she screened the capital ships of Force H as they covered another Malta convoy (Operation Style).Rohwer, p. 89 Foxhound returned to the UK in August for a refit that lasted until November. The ship was briefly assigned to Escort Group EG.3 in the North Atlantic for convoy escort duties later that month until she was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in late December.Admiralty Historical Section, pp. 232–33; English, p. 85; Rohwer, pp. 117, 126 1942–1946 Foxhound screened the light cruisers of Force B and the freighter of Convoy MF 2 from Alexandria, Egypt, to Malta in early January 1942. A week later, she escorted the cruisers covering Convoy MF 3 to Malta and was detached to escort the freighter to Benghazi, Libya, after she developed engine trouble on 18 January. En route the freighter was sunk by German aircraft and Foxhound arrived back at Alexandria on 20 January. By 29 March, the ship had been transferred to the Eastern Fleet and was assigned to the fast ships of Force A as Somerville organised his forces in anticipation of the Japanese invasion of the Indian Ocean.Rohwer, pp. 133, 136, 154 Shortly afterwards she was transferred to South Africa and the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla to escort convoys. Foxhound was then transferred to 4th Destroyer Flotilla at Freetown, Sierra Leone, in May–July 1943. The ship's forward 4.7-inch guns, Freetown, 1943 Foxhound was converted to an escort destroyer from August 1943 and she was transferred to Canada on completion on 8 February 1944. The ship was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy that same day as HMCS Qu'Appelle.MacPherson & Barrie, p. 53 After working up at the Anti-Submarine Training School at Tobermory on the Isle of Mull, she was assigned to the Western Approaches Command. Initially Qu'Appelle was a part of the 6th Escort Group based at Londonderry Port, but she was transferred to the 12th Escort Group in May where she later patrolled the western entrance to the English Channel after the Normandy landings to protect shipping from German attacks. Together with the destroyers Saskatchewan, Skeena, and Restigouche, Qu'Appelle attacked three German patrol boats off Brest on the night of 5–6 July, with the German patrol boat V715 being sunk and Qu'Appelle lightly damaged. On 11 August, the ship, Restigouche, Skeena and the destroyer Assiniboine intercepted a small convoy south of Brest. While they sank two naval trawlers, Qu'Appelle was accidentally rammed by Skeena during the engagement and was under repair until 5 September. The following month she joined the 11th Escort Group for patrols off Iceland until the end of November. The ship arrived at Halifax on 29 November to begin a refit at Pictou, Nova Scotia, that lasted from 5 December to 30 June 1945.English, p. 86; Rohwer, pp. 340, 347, 400 Qu'Appelle made four trips to the UK to ferry Canadian troops back to Canada by 25 September. The ship then became a stationary training ship for the Torpedo School at Halifax. She was placed in reserve on 27 May 1946 and then sold to German and Milne for scrap in December 1947.English, p. 86 Notes Citations Bibliography  Foreign Office: Index to the correspondence of the Foreign Office for the year 1937, Part 4.

Although assigned to the Home Fleet upon completion, the ship was attached to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1935–36 during the Abyssinia Crisis. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939, she spent time in Spanish waters, enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides of the conflict. The ship escorted the larger ships of the fleet during the early stages of World War II and played a minor role in the Norwegian Campaign of 1940. Fury was sent to Gibraltar in mid-1940 and formed part of Force H where she participated in the attack on Mers-el-Kébir and the Battle of Dakar. The ship escorted numerous convoys to Malta in 1940–41 and Arctic convoys during 1942. Fury was briefly transferred to the Mediterranean in August 1942 to participate in Operation Pedestal but returned to the Home Fleet immediately afterwards to resume her role screening convoys to Russia. She continued in this role until March 1943 when she began escorting convoys in the North Atlantic for several months. The ship was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet a few months later as the Allies began making landings in Italian territory in mid-1943. Later in the year, she participated in the Dodecanese Campaign in the Aegean where she helped to sink a German troop convoy. Fury returned to the Home Fleet in mid-1944 in preparation for Operation Neptune, the Allied invasion of France. The ship provided naval gunfire support during the landings until she struck a mine during a storm on 21 June and was then blown ashore. She was deemed uneconomical to repair and scrapping began in September. Description The F-class ships were repeats of the preceding E class. They displaced at standard load and at deep load.

By July 1942, a Type 286 short-range surface-search radar was fitted as was a HF/DF radio direction finder mounted on a pole mainmast. By February 1943 photographic evidence shows that a pair of Oerlikons had replaced her Vickers .50 machine guns. During her early 1944 refit, another pair of Oerlikons was added and her 12-pounder gun was removed. Photos taken of the ship in July 1944 show her with a Type 271 radar mounted on her searchlight platform that was probably installed during her last refit.

Fury was initially assigned to the 6th Destroyer Flotilla (DF) of the Home Fleet, but was sent to reinforce the Mediterranean Fleet, together with most of her sister ships, during the Abyssinian crisis in June.English, pp. 76–77, 86 On 11 December 1936, the day after his abdication broadcast to the nation, Fury embarked The Duke of Windsor for passage to Boulogne-sur-Mer.Pigott, p. 62 After returning home, she remained there aside from deployments to Spanish waters to enforce the arms embargo imposed on both sides in the Spanish Civil War by the Non-Intervention Committee. The flotilla was renumbered the 8th Destroyer Flotilla in April 1939, five months before the start of World War II. Fury remained assigned to it until June 1940, escorting the larger ships of the fleet and conducting anti-submarine patrols.English, p. 86 On 15 September, Fury was one of the destroyers that relieved her sisters escorting the aircraft carrier after they had sunk the after it attacked the carrier. Two months later, she was escorting the battleship when the latter struck a magnetic mine as they were entering Loch Ewe on 4 December. Fury remained there for a time in case any further mining attempts were made. In February 1940, she was one of the escorts for Convoy TC 3 carrying troops from Canada to the UK.Smith, pp. 24, 33, 35 On 17 April, Fury screened the damaged heavy cruiser as she returned to Scapa Flow after bombarding the airbase at Stavanger, Norway. Oronsay heading for the Norwegian campaign in 1940. She is lying off Gourock at the mouth of the River Clyde. Beginning on 23 April, the ship was one of the escorts for the aircraft carriers Ark Royal and as they conducted air operations off the coast of Norway in support of Allied operations ashore. Glorious was detached to refuel at Scapa Flow on the 27th and was escorted by Fury and seven other destroyers. Three days later, she screened the battleship as the latter rendezvoused with Ark Royal. On 9 May, Fury, her sister , and three other destroyers were detached from the escort of the battlecruiser in an attempt to intercept a German force of E-boats that was expected. Other forces searching for German minelayers nearby also failed to locate their quarry. During this time, the destroyers and were detached from the screen of the light cruiser to pursue a possible submarine contact and Kelly was torpedoed by S-31 in the darkness later that night. The destroyer came up to assist and towed KellyHaarr 2010, pp. 143, 150, 187–89 most of the way to Hebburn, escorted by Fury, Kandahar and the destroyer .Langtree, p. 71 On 18 May, Fury and her sisters Foresight and were transferred to the Humber to counter the threat of E-boats and minelayers in the North Sea.Admiralty Historical Section 2003, p. 59 Force H, 1940–1941 On 29 June, Fury sailed from Scapa to Gibraltar to join her sisters of the 8th DF as the escorts for Force H. On 3 July she took part in the attack on the French Fleet at Mers-el-Kébir (Operation Catapult).Smith, pp. 58–60 In late August the ship escorted Valiant and the new carrier from the UK to Gibraltar. The next day, Fury and Force H covered the passage of Valiant and Illustrious through the Western Mediterranean to rendezvous with the Mediterranean Fleet (Operation Hats).Rohwer, p. 37–38 On 13 September, Force H rendezvoused with a convoy that was carrying troops intended to capture Dakar from the Vichy French. Ten days later, they attacked Dakar, but were driven off by the Vichy French defences.Rohwer, p. 42 During the battle on 24 September, Fury, the destroyer , and the heavy cruiser engaged the Vichy French destroyer which was set on fire and forced to beach itself.English, p. 100 In early October, Fury escorted a troop convoy from Freetown, Sierra Leone, to French Cameroon.Rohwer, p. 43 She returned to Gibraltar on 19 October, together with her sisters Faulknor and .Smith, p. 67 The ship escorted the carriers and Ark Royal during Operations Coat and White in November. Fury escorted Force F to Malta during Operation Collar later in the month and participated in the inconclusive Battle of Cape Spartivento on 27 November, where she was part of the screen for the battlecruiser and the battleship . In January 1941, the ship screened Force H during Operation Excess.Rohwer, pp. 47, 49–50, 54; Smith, pp. 70–75 At the end of the month, Force H departed Gibraltar to carry out Operation Picket, an unsuccessful night torpedo attack by eight of Ark Royals Fairey Swordfish on the Tirso Dam in Sardinia. The British ships returned to Gibraltar on 4 February and began preparing for Operation Grog, a naval bombardment of Genoa, that was successfully carried out five days later.Admiralty Historical Section 2002, pp. 48–53 The following month Fury underwent a brief refit at Malta. At the end of March, together with the light cruiser and three other destroyers, the ship attempted to intercept a Vichy French convoy that included the freighter , supposedly laden with of rubber, which had already been unloaded. Her sister was ordered to board and capture Bangkok, but she was thwarted by gunfire from a coast-defence battery off the port of Nemours, Algeria.Smith, p. 86 A few days later, Fury and four other destroyers escorted Sheffield, Renown, and Ark Royal in Operation Winch, which delivered a dozen Hurricane fighters to Malta.Rohwer, p. 67 Beginning on 24 April, Fury and Force H covered Argus flying off more Hurricanes as well as the destroyers of the 5th Destroyer Flotilla sailing to Malta.Smith, p. 90 In early May she was part of the destroyer screen with five other destroyers for the battleship , and the light cruisers , and which were joining the Mediterranean Fleet. This was part of Operation Tiger which included a supply convoy taking tanks to the Middle East and the transfer of warships. Fury and her sisters had their Two-Speed Destroyer Sweep (TSDS) minesweeping gear rigged to allow them to serve as a fast minesweepers en route to Malta. Despite this, one merchant ship was sunk by mines and another damaged. Later that month, she participated in Operation Splice, another mission in which the carriers Ark Royal and flew off fighters for Malta.Rohwer, p. 72; Smith, pp. 91–96 Force H was ordered to join the escort of Convoy WS 8B in the North Atlantic on 24 May, after the Battle of the Denmark Strait on 23 May, but they were directed to search for the and the heavy cruiser on 25 May. Heavy seas increased fuel consumption for all of the escorts and Forester was forced to return to Gibraltar to refuel later that day before rejoining the capital ships of Force H on 29 May, after Bismarck had been tracked down and sunk. In early June the destroyer participated in two more aircraft delivery missions to Malta (Operations Rocket and Tracer). On 22 June, the 8th DF was tasked to intercept a German supply ship spotted heading towards the French coast. The next day they intercepted which was scuttled by her crew upon the approach of the British ships. They rescued 78 British POWs taken from ships sunk by German raiders and the crew. In late June, Fury screened Ark Royal and Furious as they flew off more fighters for Malta in Operation Railway.Smith, pp. 96–106 Another Malta convoy (Operation Substance) was conducted in mid-July, heavily escorted by Force H and elements of the Home Fleet and another in early August (Operation Style), albeit with only Force H covering the convoy.Smith, p. 110 Several weeks later, Fury participated in Operation Mincemeat, during which Force H escorted a minelayer to Livorno to lay its mines while Ark Royals aircraft attacked Northern Sardinia as a diversion.Admiralty Historical Section 2002, p. 163; Rohwer, p. 94 In late September, the destroyer escorted another convoy to Malta in Operation Halberd. Arctic Waters 1942–1943 A flotilla of destroyers led by Fury at Scapa Flow, 1942 Fury was transferred home in October and briefly joined the Greenock Special Escort Division. By December she had rejoined the 8th DF of the Home Fleet and began a refit in a Humber shipyard. On 15 February 1942 she rejoined the 8th Flotilla at Scapa Flow for service with the Russian convoys.English, p. 87 In March Fury escorted the covering force for Convoy QP 6 and Convoy PQ 12.Rohwer, p. 149 On 11–14 March, together with seven other destroyers, she attempted to intercept the as the latter sailed from Narvik to Trondheim. The Germans spotted the destroyer force and delayed Tirpitzs sailing date to avoid them.Smith, pp. 126–27 Fury and the destroyer escorted Convoy PQ 13 beginning on 23 March, later reinforced by the light cruiser . A severe storm from 25 to 27 March caused the convoy to scatter and the escorts were detailed to find the stragglers and reassemble the convoy. Fury had to find and refuel the converted whaler Sumba in response to her message that she was low on fuel and found the merchantman en route as she rejoined the convoy the next day. On the morning of 29 March, Trinidad and Fury encountered the German destroyers , , and as they attempted to rendezvous with another part of the scattered convoy. The leading destroyer, Z26, was badly damaged when Trinidad opened fire and attempted to break contact, but was tracked by the cruiser's radar and re-engaged at a range of . Trinidad fired one torpedo at Z26, but it circled around and struck the cruiser. The detonation caused her speed to drop to and allowed the German ship to disengage. Fury pursued her until they encountered the convoy and Fury turned back to screen Trinidad after firing two salvoes by mistake at Eclipse. Fury then escorted Trinidad into the Kola Inlet where they arrived the following morning.Admiralty Historical Section 2007, pp. 25, 28–31, 33 Fury remained in Murmansk until 10 March, when she screened Convoy QP 10 through to Iceland. She escorted the distant cover force of the Home Fleet as Trinidad attempted to sail home from Murmansk in mid-May, but the cruiser was sunk en route by German bombers. Fury then was a part of the screen of Home Fleet as it provided distant cover for Convoys PQ 16 and QP 12 later in the month.Rohwer, pp. 158, 165–66; Smith, p. 130 The ship was assigned as part of the close escort for Convoy QP 17 at the end of June. En route she made an unsuccessful attack on with the destroyer and corvette on 2 July, before the convoy was ordered to disperse under the threat of German surface attack.Admiralty Historical Section 2007, pp. 56–57; Rohwer, p. 175 Fury returned to the Mediterranean in early August, and was one of the close escorts of Force X for Operation Pedestal in mid-August. As the convoy passed through the Sicilian Narrows between Tunisia and Sicily, the ship used her TSDS gear to sweep for mines. During the early morning of 13 August, she unsuccessfully attempted to engage the as the latter was firing two torpedoes that sank the freighter .O'Hara, pp. 180–81, 188, 190, 192 Fury then escorted the damaged Nelson back to the UK for repairs. On 9 September 1942 she joined the escort for Convoy PQ 18, but was detached from it on 17 September to escort the returning Convoy QP 14.Admiralty Historical Section 2007, pp. 76, 80 The ship was given a brief refit on the Humber in November before resuming convoys to Russia. The following month, Fury escorted the Convoys JW 51A and RA 51 to and from Murmansk then Convoy RA 53 in February 1943.Admiralty Historical Section 2007, pp. 89, 102, 106 1943–1944 In mid-March recent successes by U-boats caused the Admiralty to transfer destroyers from the Home Fleet to escort duties in the North Atlantic. Fury was one of these and was assigned to the 4th Escort Group. In April the group escorted Convoys HX 231, HX 234 and ONS 5 (where they drove off attacking U-boat wolfpacks). In May she escorted ON 184Rohwer, pp. 239, 243, 245, 251 before beginning a brief refit on the Humber. On 17 June, Fury escorted Home Fleet units to reinforce the Mediterranean Fleet for the Sicily landings. On 10 July she formed part of the covering force for the landings.Rohwer, p. 262 On 1 September she screened the battleships and Valiant and the light cruisers and as they bombarded Reggio Calabria in support of Operation Baytown, the occupation of southernmost mainland Italy. A week later, she was part of the covering force for the landings at Salerno. After the surrender of Italy, Fury was one of the ships that escorted units of the Italian Fleet into Malta for their surrender and then to Alexandria, Egypt, arriving on 17 September.Smith, p. 186–92 A few days later, the ship was assigned to support Allied forces in the Dodecanese Campaign. On 20–21 September, she loaded of supplies and 340 men of the Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment at Haifa, Palestine, to reinforce the British garrison on Leros. Fury, Faulknor and Eclipse were diverted from the campaign on 1 October to escort the battleships and from Alexandria to Malta. Six days later, the three destroyers screened the light cruisers and as they patrolled the Dodecanese searching for German shipping, although Eclipse had to return to Alexandria early for repairs to her steering. On the morning of 7 October, they encountered a small convoy south of Levitha. The cruisers sank the escorting trawler Uj 2111 while the destroyers sank the 5,216-GRT freighter ; all of the ships engaged the barges at very short range and sank six of the seven. As the ships withdrew, they were repeatedly attacked by German aircraft which damaged Penelope.Rohwer, p. 278; Smith, pp. 196–97, 199–201 On the night of 15/16 November she bombarded Leros with the destroyers and Rohwer, p. 287 On 29 November, Fury helped to escort the recently torpedoed Birmingham to Alexandria.Smith, p. 222 Fury (in the foreground) and laying a smoke screen during manoeuvres in preparation for the Second Front. Photograph taken from Faulknor. In December she was converted at Gibraltar for use as a convoy escort in a refit that lasted until February 1944. Upon its completion, the ship rejoined the 8th DF in the Mediterranean for several months before rejoining the Home Fleet where they arrived on 11 May. After several weeks of training in preparation for her role as a shore bombardment ship during the Normandy landings, Fury sailed from Scapa to Portsmouth on 26 May.Smith, pp. 234–35 The ship was assigned to Bombardment Force E, supporting Juno Beach and the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division and No. 48 (Royal Marine) Commando assaulting the beach.Rohwer, p. 331; Smith, p. 237 Fury and Faulknor left the Solent on 5 June as the escort for the minesweepers of Convoy J-1. She arrived at the beachhead and took up her bombardment position on 6 June where, along with Faulknor and the destroyers , and the Free French-manned La Combattante, she carried out a preliminary bombardment of the area west of Courseulles and then gunfire support as requested. The ship returned to Portsmouth periodically to reammunition and resupply as needed.Smith, pp. 237–39, 247 Fury high and dry on the beach at Arromanches after she had been mined and driven ashore in a gale on 21 June At 10:38 on the morning of 21 June, Fury detonated a ground mine off Juno Beach during a gale and the navy decided to tow her into the British Mulberry harbour at Arromanches where her damage could be evaluated. While waiting for a tugboat, she took on a 6° list to starboard from flooding. The Dutch tug Thames began towing the ship at 13:25; at 21:14, Fury accidentally collided with the stern of a freighter anchored outside the Mulberry, damaging her port side above the waterline, and the towline snapped at 21:49 when she struck another ship several times. She let go her anchor after drifting clear, but it almost immediately started dragging under the pressure of the wind and waves and the salvage ship Lincoln Salvor was secured alongside to steady Fury. Another tug made a towline fast at 22:18, but it immediately snapped when the tug began to pull forward. Lincoln Salvor had to cast off as her wooden hull was being damaged by slamming into Furys hull and six other tugboats attempted to tow the destroyer clear of the shipping in the Mulberry, but they all failed. Fury struck at least three other ships, including petrol and ammunition ships before she was driven ashore at 01:30. Her crew was able to walk to Arromanches at about 05:30 once the tide went out.Evans, pp. 195–96 She was subsequently refloated on 5 July and towed back to the UK.Evans, p. 196 The subsequent survey declared her a constructive total loss, and the ship was sold to Thos W Ward by BISCO. Fury was towed Briton Ferry to be scrapped, arriving there on 18 September 1944.

Almost immediately after being commissioned, in May 1940, the ship began evacuating Allied troops from Dunkirk and other locations in France. Afterwards she was assigned to the Western Approaches Command for convoy escort duties. Harvester and another destroyer sank a German submarine in October. She was briefly assigned to Force H in May 1941, but her anti-aircraft armament was deemed too weak and she was transferred to the Newfoundland Escort Force in June 1941 for escort duties in the North Atlantic. The ship was returned to the Western Approaches Command in October 1941 and was converted to an escort destroyer in early 1942. Harvester was torpedoed and sunk in March 1943 by a German submarine after having rammed and sunk another submarine the previous day while escorting Convoy HX 228.

For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, Harvester had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0.5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for torpedoes. One depth charge rail and two throwers were originally fitted, but this was increased to three sets of rails and eight throwers while fitting-out. The ship's load of depth charges was also increased, from 20 to 110.English, p. 141Friedman, p. 226 Wartime modifications Harvester had her rear torpedo tubes replaced by a 12-pounder AA gun after the evacuation of Dunkirk in 1940, but it is not known exactly when this modification was made. During her 1942 conversion to an escort destroyer, the ship's short-range AA armament had been augmented by two Oerlikon 20 mm guns on the wings of the ship's bridge. The .50-calibre machine gun mounts were replaced by a pair of Oerlikons later. 'A' gun was replaced by a Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar. The ship's director-control tower and rangefinder above the bridge were removed in exchange for a Type 271 target indication radar. A Type 286 short-range surface search radar was probably also fitted midway through the war. The ship also received a HF/DF radio direction finder mounted on a pole mainmast. Service Jurua was ordered by Brazil on 6 December 1937 from Vickers-Armstrongs, Barrow-in-Furness. The ship was laid down on 3 June 1938 and she was purchased by the British on 5 September 1939 and renamed HMS Handy. The ship was launched on 29 September 1939 and renamed Harvester in January 1940 as her original name was thought too liable to be confused with . Harvester was commissioned on 23 May and briefly worked up at Portland Harbour before she was assigned to the 9th Destroyer Flotilla.English, p. 127 The ship joined the Dunkirk evacuation on 29 May and returned 272 men to Dover during the day. However, the situation at Dunkirk soon became too dangerous to risk the larger and more modern destroyers, so Harvester made no attempt to evacuate any troops during daylight hours on 30 May. This decision was rescinded during the day on 30 May and the ship sailed for Dunkirk on the night of 30/31 May. En route she was narrowly missed by two torpedoes, but she rescued 1341 men in two trips on 31 May and an additional 576 on 1 June.Wisner, pp. 20, 25, 87 Harvester was lightly damaged by strafing German aircraft that same day and required repairs that were made at Chatham. On 9 June the ship was ordered to Le Havre, France, to evacuate British troops, but none were to be found. She loaded 78 men at Saint-Valery-en-Caux on 11 June. Later in the month she escorted ships evacuating refugees and troops from Saint-Nazaire and St. Jean de Luz (Operation Ariel).Wisner, pp. 38, 48, 128, 146 From July to September, Harvester was assigned to convoy escort duties with the Western Approaches Command and she rescued 90 survivors from the armed merchant cruiser on 27 August. The ship, together with five other destroyers of the 9th Flotilla, was assigned to Plymouth Command for anti-invasion duties between 8 and 18 September before returning to her role as an escort vessel. On 30 October, with help from her sister , she sank the . Harvester rescued 19 survivors from the merchant vessel on 5 December and 131 survivors from the Armed Boarding Vessel Crispin on 3 February 1941. She rescued four survivors from a Royal Air Force Armstrong Whitworth Whitley bomber four days later.English, pp. 127, 132 The ship was refitted at Barrow between 18 March and 18 April and then was assigned to Force H in Gibraltar where she escorted ships during Operations Tiger and Splice in May. Harvester was transferred to the Newfoundland Escort Force in June as her anti-aircraft capability was believed by Admiral James Somerville to be too weak. She was assigned to the 14th Escort Group upon her arrival at St. John's on 1 July. The ship was transferred back to the Western Approaches Command three months laterEnglish, pp. 127–28 and assigned to the 9th Escort Group.Rohwer, p. 104 Harvester was converted to an escort destroyer during a lengthy refit at Dundee, Scotland, from 30 January 1942 to 16 April. She conducted sea trials of her Type 271 radar during May and then resumed her escort duties in the North Atlantic as flagship of Mid-Ocean Escort Force Escort Group B-3.English, p. 128 The ship was refitted at Liverpool between 12 December and 11 February 1943. Whilst defending Convoy HX 228 on 3 March, Harvester forced to the surface and then rammed it. She was badly damaged by the ramming, but she rescued five survivors after the submarine sank. The next day, Harvester was torpedoed by and broke in half. Nine officers and 136 ratings were lost, but the rammed and sank U-432 herself and then rescued Harvesters few survivors.

She participated in the Norwegian Campaign in May 1940 and was assigned to convoy escort and anti-submarine patrols with the Western Approaches Command afterwards. The ship was briefly assigned to Force H in 1941, but her anti-aircraft armament was deemed too weak and she rejoined Western Approaches Command. Havelock became flotilla leader of Escort Group B-5 of the Mid-Ocean Escort Force in early 1942 and continued to escort convoys in the North Atlantic for the next two years. The ship was converted to an escort destroyer and sank one submarine during the war. After the end of the war, she escorted the ships carrying the Norwegian government in exile back to Norway and served as a target ship through mid-1946. Havelock was scrapped beginning in late 1946.

For anti- aircraft (AA) defence, Havelock had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0.5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for torpedoes. One depth charge rail and two throwers were originally fitted, but this was increased to three sets of rails and eight throwers while fitting-out. The ship's load of depth charges was increased from 20 to 110 as well.English, p. 141Friedman, p. 226 Havelock was completed without a director-control tower (DCT) so the three remaining 4.7-inch low-angle guns fired in local control using ranges provided by a rangefinder. She was fitted with an ASDIC set to detect submarines by reflections from sound waves beamed into the water.Brown, p. 164 Wartime modifications Havelock was fitted with a HF/DF radio direction finder before completion and she had her rear torpedo tubes replaced by a 12-pounder AA gun by October 1940.Friedman, pp. 241, 247 The ship's short-range AA armament was later augmented by two Oerlikon 20 mm guns on the wings of the ship's bridge and the .50-calibre machine gun mounts were replaced by a pair of Oerlikons. It is uncertain if the ship's director-control tower was installed before a Type 271 target indication radar was installed above the bridge. At some point, the ship was converted to an escort destroyer. 'A' gun was replaced by a Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar and additional depth charge stowage replaced the 12-pounder high-angle gun. A Type 286 short-range surface search radar was fitted and the HF/DF installation was moved to a pole mainmast. History Jutahy was ordered by Brazil on 8 December 1937 from J. Samuel White, Cowes. The ship was laid down on 31 May 1938 and was purchased by the British on 5 September 1939 after the beginning of the Second World War and renamed HMS Havelock. She was launched on 16 October and commissioned on 10 February 1940. After working up, the ship was assigned to the 9th Destroyer Flotilla of the Western Approaches Command.English, p. 129 Havelock was detached to Home Fleet during the Norwegian Campaign and supported the Allied landings on 12–13 May at Bjerkvik during the Battle of Narvik. During the initial stages of this battle, she mounted a French mortar battery on her forecastle.Haarr, pp. 246, 248, 250 She continued to provide fire support during the battle for the rest of the month. During the nights of 30 and 31 May, the ship helped to evacuate troops from Bodø to Harstad and Borkenes to await further evacuation. Havelock was one of the ships that escorted the troop ships evacuating the troops from the Narvik area on 7 and 8 June.Haarr, pp. 266, 269, 300, 312 She was commanded by Capt. E. Barry Stevens, DSC. Later in June, the ship rejoined the 9th Destroyer Flotilla and spent most of the next two years escorting convoys. Late in 1940 the Flotilla was redesignated as the 9th Escort Group. Havelock was attached to Force H in Gibraltar to reinforce the escort during Operations Tiger in May 1941. The ship returned to the Western Approaches command afterwards as her anti-aircraft capability was believed by Admiral James Somerville to be too weak for operations in the Mediterranean.English, pp. 129–30 In March 1942, Havelock became flotilla leader of Escort Group B-5 team of the Mid-Ocean Escort Force and continued to escort convoys in the North Atlantic until early 1944. From 28 December to 14 January 1943, the escort group defended Convoy TM 1, a group of nine oil tankers sailing from Trinidad to Gibraltar. The convoy was attacked by several U-boat wolfpacks en route and lost seven of its ships despite the best efforts of its escort. Havelock only managed to damage with depth charges whilst escorting this convoy. Havelock and her consorts escorted Convoy SC 122 through the largest convoy battle of the war some two months later. In mid-1943, the escort group was deployed to the Bay of Biscay to attack U-boats in cooperation with the Royal Air Force (RAF) as they left their bases on the French Atlantic coast.Rohwer, pp. 220–21, 238–39, 256–57 In late September – early October, the group escorted ships carrying No. 247 Group RAF to the Azores to begin setting up airbases there.English, p. 130 In early 1944, Havelock was transferred to the 14th Escort Group which was given the task of protecting the convoys supporting Operation Overlord, the impending invasion of Western Europe, in British coastal waters, captained by Earl H. Thomas. Together with the destroyers and , the ship sank on 18 June.Rohwer, p. 333 She was refitted in Liverpool from July to September and rejoined the group upon completion. Havelock was under repair again in February–April 1945, but they were completed by 30 April when the ship, together with her sister , attacked the wreck of northwest of the island of Anglesey thinking that it was which had been spotted by a Short Sunderland flying boat earlier that day.Rohwer, p. 406 Two weeks later, Havelock and the 14th Escort Group escorted a group of surrendered German U-boats from Loch Alsh to Lough Foyle. On 27 May, the ship, together with Hesperus, escorted the exiled Norwegian government back to Oslo and remained there until 1 June. Later that month, she began service as an aircraft target, a role that lasted for the next year. The ship was approved for scrapping on 18 February 1946 and was placed in Category C reserve on 2 August.

History She was originally ordered as Jaguaribe on 16 December 1937 by the Brazilian Navy. The ship was laid down by John I. Thornycroft and Company at Woolston, Hampshire, on 28 September 1938 and was purchased by the British on 5 September 1939 after the beginning of World War II. Renamed HMS Highlander, she was launched on 16 October and commissioned on 18 March 1940.English, p. 127 After working up at Portland Harbour, she was assigned to the 9th Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet and began escort duty on 11 April. Six days later, the ship ran aground in the Shetland Islands and was moderately damaged. Re-floated, Highlander was repaired at Hull between 20 April and 19 May. She escorted the battlecruiser to Scapa Flow and arrived there on 24 May. The flotilla was transferred to the Western Approaches Command in mid-June and Highlander rescued survivors of the torpedoed armed merchant cruiser en route to Plymouth.English, p. 131 Later in the month, the ship escorted ships evacuating Allied troops from French ports on the Atlantic coast (Operation Ariel).Winser, p. 146 Highlander then rejoined the 9th Destroyer Flotilla on convoy escort duties until January 1941. During this time, she was briefly refitted in mid-July with a 12-pounder AA gun replacing her rear set of torpedo tubes and, together with her sister , the ship sank the on 30 October. On 1 December, she escorted the torpedoed Canadian destroyer to Barrow-in- Furness for repairs. Highlander began a longer refit at Hawthorn Leslie's shipyard at Hebburn from 30 January to 23 March 1941.English, p. 132 After its completion, the ship was briefly assigned to Force H at Gibraltar,Rohwer, p. 67 before continuing on to Freetown to begin escort duties with the 18th Destroyer Flotilla there. She remained there until August when she was transferred to Londonderry where she was later assigned to the 28th Escort Group of Western Approaches Command. Highlander was refitted and rearmed from 2 February–18 March 1942 at Tilbury. She became flotilla leader for Escort Group B4 and was assigned to the Mid-Ocean Escort Force when her refit was completed. The ship and her consorts escorted Convoy SC 122 through the largest convoy battle of the war in March 1943; Highlander was unsuccessfully attacked by and during the battle.Rohwer, p. 238 The ship was given an extensive overhaul at Troon from 28 December–12 April 1944 that was lengthened when she was damaged in a collision with a tugboat. Upon its completion, she rejoined her group and remained with them until September when she was transferred to Escort Group B2 and became its flotilla leader. Highlander crushed her bow on 15 April 1945 when she struck some ice; she had to be towed to Bay Bulls, Newfoundland, for temporary repairs. She received permanent repairs at nearby St. John's from 17 April to 24 July. The ship reached Portsmouth five days later and later sailed to Rosyth for service as a target ship for aircraft. Highlander was placed in Category C reserve on 19 January 1946 and was approved for scrapping on 19 February 1946. She was sold on 27 May, but demolition did not begin until May 1947.

It was first performed in the Green Banana Restaurant at the Ambiance Lunch-hour Theatre Club in London.Stoppard Plays at http://www.doollee.com/PlaywrightsS/stoppard-tom.html  History  Tom Stoppard wrote After Magritte during the period of his well-known plays Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead and The Real Inspector Hound. Stoppard was already well-established as a writer of stage, radio, and television plays. The idea struck for After Magritte came to him while writing the Radio play Artist Descending a Staircase, which was based on a Marcel Duchamp painting of a similar name. Around this time Tom Stoppard was beginning to become interested in bringing his plays to an American stage.  Motifs   Surrealism  After Magritte is an example of Surrealism in the arts, in which what is seen by the naked eye is not what the art necessarily expresses. The basis of the surrealism in this play is the predisposition of Rene Magritte as a surrealist painter; Stoppard sought to bring to life the characters inside of Magritte’s surrealist reality. The idea behind After Magritte is partly to represent the surrealist schools of thought that are shared between art forms, but also to animate Magritte's world of still images, and to its illogical situations perpetually illogical.  Absurdism (Art vs Reality)  After Magritte is also an example of Absurdism, which is based on the idea that humans are always in search of inherent meaning in life, even when there is no meaning—at least none that is understandable. As Rene Magritte's paintings places figures in situations that are devoid of meaning to our eyes, so Stoppard's characters try to find meaning, even as they don’t know why they are in this painting or why they are doing certain things. Stoppard creates confusion through his use of language: \\"Several critics have noticed the specific quality of language in the play, the use of puns and the fact that language is an inadequate means of describing reality.\\"  Setting of the play  The setting of the play takes in an unidentified Rene Magritte painting that bears similarities to his L'assassin menacé. Stoppard describes the set in his script: “The only light comes through the large window which is facing the audience…The central ceiling light hangs from a long flex which disappears up into the flies. The lampshade itself it a heavy metal hemisphere, opaque,…similarly hanging from the flies, is a fruit basket attractively overflowing with apples, oranges, bananas, pineapple, and grapes,…It will become apparent that the light fixture is on a counterweight system, it can be raised and lowered, or kept in any vertical position, by means of the counterbalance, which in this case is a basket of fruit. Most of the furniture is stack up against the street door in a sort of barricade, an essential item is a long low bench-type table, about eight feet long, but the pile also includes a settee, two comfortable chairs, a TV set, a cupboard and a wind up gramophone with an old-fashioned horn…” The set as described by Stoppard resembles the beginning of the play Tango by Slawomir Mrożek, which was translated by Stoppard in 1966. Synopsis The play begins with an astonished policeman looking through the window of a house where a group of people are posed in a bizarre, surreal tableau reminiscent of the paintings of René Magritte. Finding this suspicious, he calls in his inspector. Inside the room, a rational explanation for the tableau gradually becomes apparent. Two ballroom dancers, a man and a woman named Reginald and Thelma Harris, are hurriedly getting ready for an event. A lampshade which had used bullets as a counterweight has broken and a woman crawls on the floor to look for them. The mother plays the tuba. The inspector arrives and asks about the family's memories of a man they had seen outside of the Tate Gallery, where a René Magritte exhibit is being held. He invents an entirely false story, accusing the family of complicity in a crime known as the Crippled Minstrel Caper. As he continues, the stage picture becomes increasingly ridiculous. For instance, the couple offers the inspector a banana as the male dancer stands on one foot. One scene is even performed in total darkness.Absurdist Reviews at By the end of the play, the characters are posed in another Magritte-like tableau.  Reception  Randolph Ryan praised After Magritte as “a clever and funny look at the problem of determining reality, reduced from philosophic terms to those of farce.” Theresa Montana Sabo dubbed it \\"witty\\" along with The Real Inspector Hound (1968). Jadwiga Uchman called the play \\"hilariously funny\\" in 1999 and argued, \\"Stoppard wittily employs language to create confusion, making it clear that it is an imperfect tool for describing reality.\\" Nancy Worssam of The Seattle Times wrote, \\"None of this preposterous yet outrageously funny behavior seems to make sense. Amazingly, by play’s conclusion, everything that had appeared to be totally idiotic is explainable. And isn’t that more than a bit like life?\\" Leone Lucille Michel stated, \\"Attention to structure at the expense of ideas marks this as one of Stoppard's less notable achievements. Nevertheless, as ingeniously constructed light entertainment, After Magritte succeeds to a great extent\\". Jess M. Bravin of The Harvard Crimson said that the play is, like The Real Inspector Hound, weaker in character development and plot than in dialogue, but that this is a less important flaw in the case of After Magritte because of its brevity. He described both works as \\"diverting and enjoyable entertainment\\". Adam Langer praised the exchanges between the five characters about the man walking near the gallery as \\"hilariously whimsical and disorienting [...] despite the sophomoric philosophizing about perceptions, the play, with its many inspired sight gags and turns of phrase, can be a hoot.\\" Clive Barnes referred to After Magritte as \\"a brief Dadaist sketch that somehow does not quite sustain itself\\". J. Wynn Rousuck of The Baltimore Sun dismissed it as a \\"trifle\\" for Stoppard. Todd Everett wrote that \\"Stoppard’s manic script [...] simply doesn’t make much sense.\\"  Premiere  Actors and characters for premiere at the Green Banana Restaurant at the Ambiance Lunch-hour Theatre Club in London. * Harris - Stephen Moore * Thelma - Prunella Scales * Mother - Josephine Tewson * Foot - Clive Barker * Holmes - Malcom Ingram Directed by Geoffrey Reeves References 1970 plays Plays by Tom Stoppard ","title":"After Magritte"},{"id":"14445494","text":"The Nature and Purpose of the Universe is a play written by Christopher Durang, first produced in 1975. The work is an absurdist comedy concerning the irony of Catholic dogma, a theme visited in other Durang plays, including Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All For You, Laughing Wild, and The Marriage of Bette and Boo. Nature and Purpose deals primarily with an unhappy housewife's religious faith being tested by nightmarish circumstances which church dogma teaches she must willingly endure. Productions The Nature and Purpose of the Universe was produced by the Direct Theatre at the Wonder Horse Theatre, New York, on February 21, 1979. Directed by Allen B.

At the center of the story is Eleanor, a sweet, sad housewife horribly treated by her husband Steve and most every other character in the play, most of whom are actually the \\"agents of God\\" in disguise. Eleanor's oldest son Donald is a drug addict, a dealer, and a pimp, middle son Gary an angry homosexual, and youngest son Andy has lost his penis in a reaper accident. When it seems to Eleanor that there isn't any hope for escape from her miserable existence, a door-to-door brush salesman professes his love for her and promises he'll return to carry her away forever, however, the salesman is actually one of the agents of God once again testing Eleanor's threshold for misery. After numerous trials and tribulations (including a sadistic rape) the revelation that the brush salesman was lying, and a Papal assassination, the family finds itself exiled in Iceland, where it appears Eleanor's nightmare will only continue.

In 1960, Wander bought the rights to Poppycock, a snack consisting of caramelized popcorn and nuts, from Harold Vair, a Detroit candy shop owner. In 1968, Wander merged with Sandoz Nutrition Corporation, a division of Sandoz, to form Sandoz-Wander, Inc. (which is today the pharmaceutical company Novartis). Poppycock production was moved from Villa Park to Lincoln, Nebraska and the Lincoln Snacks Company was created as an operating division of Sandoz-Warner.

Biography Waller was born in New York City on February 15, 1839, the son of Irish immigrant parents. His father's name was Thomas Armstrong, and his parents died before he turned eight. He earned a living by selling newspapers and working as a cabin boy, and was considering going to California during the gold rush of 1849, when a New London man named Robert Waller offered to provide him a home and an education in Connecticut. Waller accepted his offer, was adopted by the elder Waller, and received an education in the New London schools, where he was noted for his skills in public speaking. In 1859 he married Charlotte Bishop and they had six children. Career After his graduation from Bartlett High School, he studied law and he was admitted to the bar in 1861, the same year that the Civil War began. He enlisted in the Second Connecticut Volunteers in April, due to an eye disease he was discharged two months later. Using his oratory talents to recruit volunteers for the Union, and his work in arguing cases in court, drew attention to his speaking ability. Ge served in the Connecticut House of Representatives in 1867, 1872, and 1876, and was Speaker in 1876. He also served as Secretary of the State of Connecticut from 1870 to 1871, and mayor of New London, Connecticut from 1873 to 1879. In 1882 Waller ran for governor on the Democratic ticket and defeated William Bulkeley (brother of future governor Morgan Bulkeley) by more than 4,000 votes. He served from January 3, 1883 to January 8, 1885. In 1884 Waller sought reelection and received more votes than his Republican opponent, Henry Baldwin Harrison, but it was less than the 50% majority required by law; the choice fell to the state legislature, which was controlled by Republicans, and they selected Harrison. Waller gained attention at the 1884 Democratic National Convention when he made the seconding speech nominating Thomas A. Hendricks for vice president on the ticket with presidential nominee Grover Cleveland. Cleveland and Hendricks won, and the following year Cleveland appointed Waller as Consul-General in London, where he served from 1885 to 1889. Waller's home, \\"Neptune Park\\" in the Ocean Beach section of New London, Connecticut (from a 1910 postcard) When Waller returned to New London in 1889, he opened law offices there and in New York City. \\"I work five days a week in New York,\\" he once said in jest, \\"that I may live two in Connecticut.\\" In 1893 he served on the commission for the Chicago Columbian Exposition. At the 1896 Democratic national convention, he was an articulate spokesman for the gold faction supporting the Cleveland's policies and opposing William Jennings Bryan. He campaigned hard for the Gold Democratic ticket headed by John M Palmer of Illinois. Waller also served as a delegate to Connecticut's 1902 Constitutional Convention. Death Waller died on January 25, 1924, at his Ocean Beach home in New London. He is interred at Cedar Grove Cemetery in New London, Connecticut. There is a Waller Street in New London that is named after him. References External links * Sobel, Robert and John Raimo. Biographical Directory of the Governors of the United States, 1789-1978.

It is a cosmid, and contains two functioning (wild-type) closely linked genes: a gene of interest and a mosaic marker. Such an array is injected into germ line cells, which already contain mutant (specifically, loss of function) alleles of all three genes in their chromosomal DNA. The cosmid, which is not packed correctly during mitosis, is occasionally present in only one daughter cell following cell division. The daughter cell containing the array expresses the gene of interest; the cell lacking the array does not. The mosaic marker is a gene which exhibits a visible phenotype change between the functioning and non-functioning alleles. For example, ncl-1, located in chromosomal DNA, exhibits a larger nucleolus than the wild-type allele, which is in the array. Thus, cells which exhibit larger nucleoli have usually not retained the extrachromosomal array. The gene of interest is the target of the mosaic analysis. Cells lacking the extrachromosomal array also lack the functional gene of interest. Cells which develop normally without the array do not require the gene of interest for normal function. Cells which do not develop normally are said to require the gene. In this way, those cell lineages which require a specific gene can be identified. Extrachromosomal arrays replace an earlier technique involving a duplicated piece of chromosome called a free duplication. The latter technique required that the gene of interest and the mosaic marker be closely linked on the duplication; the former allows free choice of mosaic marker and target gene.

The plot was inspired by a true story about a pipe bomb improvised explosive device (IED) that was placed around the neck of an extortion victim. The name came from the PVC pipes used for the explosive device. This directorial debut premiered at the Cannes International Film Festival in 2007 as an official selection of the Directors' Fortnight. The 84-minute film was shot in one single continuous take without cuts using a Glidecam Smooth Shooter and a Glidecam 2000 Pro camera stabilization system. The film won numerous awards at the International Thessaloniki Film Festival. Plot The film, set in Colombia, opens with a gang in a car, carefully looking after a certain package. The gang is led by a violent and volatile man who is only known as Benjamin. A few moments later, the gang arrives at a farm and storm the house, taking the family hostage. Benjamin then says that there is money in the house, and that the family will give it to them if they want to remain unharmed. However, Simon, the man of the house, says that they are wrong and that they are a really poor family who have never had much money. A furious Benjamin holds Simon at gunpoint, while one of his henchmen begins taking measurements of all the family member's necks, he realizes that the only person who has the \\"desired\\" measurements is Simon's wife, Ofelia. The man then takes out the package seen at the beginning of the film and opens it, revealing 2 pieces of PVC pipes and other instruments; he places the pieces around Ofelia's neck and straps them together, forming a \\"collar bomb\\". Benjamin then orders the family to lay down on their stomachs, the family complies and, a few minutes later, realize the gang is gone. The shocked family, still asking themselves why they were attacked if they had no money, begin trying to take the device off Ofelia's neck (being completely unaware of what the device was) but are unable to do so. They find a cassette tape in the package where the device was, and play it on a stereo player. The cassette is a message left by the gang, asking for a ransom of 15 million pesos to remove the collar, and at the same time warning them not to tamper with the device or go to the police. Since the family has no money, they decide to ask help to the police anyway. They use a cellphone to call Ofelia's sister so that she in turn can call the police. The national guard and the Colombian army react quickly and arranges a meeting with Ofelia so that they can remove the device. However, the meeting point is far away, and so the family asks a neighbor (who is also unaware of what the collar was) to drive them to the meeting point. He initially complies but then tells them to get out of the car after realizing the device is actually a bomb. The family are forced to walk, but luckily they are given a ride by a couple of men who were pushing a wagon along the train rails. Soon after, the device begins making a beeping noise, which terrorizes the family. They eventually reach the meeting point and meet with Jairo, an officer from the national guard's bomb squad, who begins examining the device. He knows the procedure to remove it, but he lacks the proper tools and is forced to improvise with a kitchen knife, a candle, and a lighter. The process takes a long time, since the knife is not very sharp and the candle takes a long time to heat it. The army eventually arrives and sets around a perimeter, and a lot of passersby start gathering around the perimeter to watch. Ofelia, who was initially relatively calm, is now visibly distraught and has a breakdown after Jairo tells her to \\"excuse her for a second\\" to which she replies \\"I have no spare seconds\\". Jairo eventually manages to remove a piece from the device, and finds the explosive component. He attempts to remove it but realizes it's more complicated than that when the device releases toxic fumes from a chemical detonator that was hidden inside. Jairo barely manages to avoid the fumes. Ofelia doesn't and she goes into respiratory arrest, but is helped by the paramedics on site and manages to breathe normally again. Jairo successfully removes the chemical detonator, he reports it to his CO, who congratulates him and reassures Ofelia that she will be fine, Ofelia takes his word and starts calming down. As the CO begins walking to the safe zone, the camera turns black, and an explosion is heard, Ofelia's family rush to the site and realize that despite all efforts, the bomb has detonated, killing Ofelia. Jairo can be seen lying on the floor with severe burns on his arm (although it is unknown if he is dead or just injured). The camera then moves towards Ofelia's youngest daughter, who is watching in horror from a distance. The film ends with the girl crying and asking \\"Why God, why?\\". Jairo's fate, as well as the gang's, is left unknown.

Camarillo, along with his brother Juan Jr., owned much of what later became the town known by their family name, Camarillo.Ventura County Information Site - Where Did The Name \\"Camarillo\\" Come From? Camarillo also donated the land for Adolfo Camarillo High School.Adolfo Camarillo High School - official site The horse breed Camarillo White Horse was named for Camarillo. He began breeding them in 1921 and the line continues today. Because of his philanthropy in 1950, Pope Pius XII named him a Knight of St. Gregory the Great. Biography Camarillo was born to Juan (1812–1880) and Martina Camarillo (1826–1898). He had four sisters and one brother. In 1875, Juan purchased one of the last remaining Mexican land grants, Rancho Calleguas, from the Ruiz family; it was later willed to his wife. Upon Juan's death, Adolfo Camarillo took over operations of the family ranch at age 16. His brother Juan Jr. was more interested in religion. The ranch was almost ,City of Camarillo Official Site , Local History and was left to Adolfo and Juan Jr. upon the death of their mother. The land went on to become Camarillo Ranch, which in turn grew into the city of Camarillo. Adolfo Camarillo ran the ranch until his death in 1958. In 1885, Camarillo graduated from the International Business College at Woodbury University in Los Angeles. After that he took over full-time management of the ranch at age 21. In 1888 he married Isabella Menchaca (1861–1936). He and Isabella raised seven children: Frank, Isabel, Minerva, Rosa, Carmen, Ave Marie, and Martina. The ranch grew from a mostly cattle operation to both cattle and crops. Camarillo focused mainly in developing crops and became a leading innovator, bringing in lima beans, plus barley, corn, alfalfa, walnuts, and citrus. Camarillo had a love of fiestas, horses, rodeos and barbecues. He kept a stable of a dozen pure white horses of Arabian and Morgan descent. His horses often participated in parades in California. He died of pneumonia on December 10, 1958, and was interred in the family crypt beneath St. Mary Magdalen Church in Camarillo, alongside his parents, his wife, sisters and brother.St. Mary Magdalen Parish , History Camarillo White Horses  The Camarillo White Horse is a relatively Spanish-blooded horse known for its pure white color. This breed dates back to 1921, when Camarillo purchased a nine-year-old horse named Sultan from the Miller and Lux cattle ranch at the California State Fair in Sacramento.the Free Library Rose parade article Over the next few years, Sultan won many stock championships throughout California. Camarillo bred Sultan to Morgan mares at his ranch. For the next 65 years the family privately owned and bred the Camarillo White Horses. Since the 1930s these horses have become famous by being featured up and down the California coast at parades and events. Once a year Camarillo rode one of his white Arabians in the Fiesta of Santa Barbara while dressed up in a colorful Spanish costume. The Camarillo White Horses were privately owned and bred by the Camarillo family until the death of Camarillo's daughter Carmen in 1987, after which, according to her wishes, the horses were sold at public auction, ending the tradition of exclusive ownership of the breed by the Camarillo family. The city of Camarillo especially felt the loss, as the Camarillo White Horses were a favorite entry at the annual Christmas and Fiesta parades. The horses share the city's symbol with Adolfo Camarillo; it appears on all the street signs, city vehicles, banks, Chamber of Commerce insignia, and shopping centers. Camarillo White Horses History Many people of note have ridden on Camarillo White Horses including Governor Ronald Reagan, President Warren G. Harding, and 1946 Nobel Peace Prize recipient John Mott, as well as movie stars Leo Carrillo and Steven Ford (son of President Gerald Ford). As of 2010 there are only 20 Camarillo White Horses: three stallions, five mares, three geldings, two colts, and seven foals. Personal achievements Camarillo was a member of the Ventura County Board of Supervisors for eight years. He also was a member of the Knights of Columbus, serving as Grand Knight of the Oxnard Council for two terms, was a member of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks of Santa Barbara, and was a member of the Native Sons of the Golden West. Besides running his ranch he was a vice president of the First National Bank of Ventura, vice president of the Ojai State Bank of Nordhoff, a director of the Bank of A. Levy, of Oxnard, and was a stockholder in the First National Bank of Oxnard and in the Fillmore State Bank in Ventura County.The History of Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, and Ventura Counties Volume 2 by Gidney, Charles M.; Brooks, Benjamin; Sheridan, Edwin M. Camarillo had leadership roles on the Ventura County Fair Board and on the California State Fair Board, and in the Camarillo City Chamber of Commerce, Peoples Lumber Company, Los Rancheros Visitadores, and California Lima Bean Growers Association. He served as a member of the Pleasant Valley School District Board of Trustees for 57 years, from 1894 to 1951. Contributions Camarillo made significant contributions to Ventura County. He helped found the Oxnard Union High School District on October 4, 1901. The boundary was from the Ventura River to the Los Angeles County line.\\"History of OHS\\" Oxnard High School official website. Accessed 16 November 2014 In 1956, when the district was ready to build the first high school in Camarillo, he donated 50 acres of land. He was present for the groundbreaking of this school that was named after him. Adolfo Camarillo High School opened in 1958. According to Carol Yung, a volunteer at the Camarillo Ranch who is also a board member and tour guide for the Camarillo Ranch Foundation, the high school cheerleaders and band walked over to the Camarillo Ranch House to celebrate his birthday. In 1904 Camarillo donated land to extend the Southern Pacific Railroad through Camarillo and for the expansion of St. John's Seminary to include St. John's College. He also donated land in 1937 for the Conejo Grade portion of the highway that is now the Ventura Freeway. In 1890 Camarillo, with the help of two Chumash Indian boys, planted two rows of eucalyptus trees. The trees lined Highway 101 in Camarillo for many years. Some of the trees are still present along the north side of the freeway. Camarillo Ranch House The Camarillo Ranch House is a Queen Anne Victorian style home that was built in 1892 by Camarillo and several other workers; the house was a cultural and social hub that was the center of the ranch. Camarillo enlisted the services of architects Franklin Ward and Herman Anlauf. Camarillo used his ranch mostly for growing crops. His main crops were lima beans, barley, corn, alfalfa, walnuts, and citrus. According to Carol Yung, some of the land that Camarillo owned was in the Mission Oaks and Leisure Village area of the city that now bears his name. After his death in 1958, the land went to his family. Financial problems arose after some family deaths, so parcels of land were sold off due to taxes and land was given to St. John Cemetery. The property, including the barn and stable adjacent to the ranch house, was given to the city of Camarillo in 1997. The city relocated the buildings to their current locations on the ranch in 1999, and restored the exterior and foundation of the Camarillo Ranch House in 1999-2000. This renovation included upgrades, exterior lighting, and a ranch-style fence around the perimeter as well as a new roof and utilities. About $1.5 million and over 10,000 volunteered hours were invested. In 2001 the Camarillo Ranch House was opened to the public. Today, the city of Camarillo funds basic maintenance. The Camarillo Ranch Foundation has restored the entire interior of the house. This was done with donations and support from volunteers in the community. The foundation worked on matching specific styles of the rooms to match what they could have looked like when Camarillo and his family lived there. Camarillo Ranch Foundation In 1998 the Camarillo Ranch Foundation was established by the city of Camarillo. The foundation was recognized as a non-profit public corporation. The Camarillo Ranch's mission statement includes: > \\"To preserve, restore, and maintain The Camarillo Ranch as a historic site > in partnership with our public and private sectors, on a self-sustaining > basis; to foster its place in the rich history of California; to transform > it into a focal point of the community for education, enrichment, and > enjoyment; and to exhibit our diverse history and culture\\". Events at the Ranch House According to Michael Lavenant, a board member from 2001 to 2011, the Camarillo Ranch House is available for weddings, receptions, bar mitzvahs, filming and corporate events. Among many of the events hosted here each year, weddings are the biggest source of income for the ranch. The restored barn is also host to many events. For example, on May 20, 2010, Republican gubernatorial nominee Meg Whitman came to the Camarillo Ranch House for a campaign event to discuss immigration and education. Additionally, the ranch each year hosts two major fund raisers for the house: the Candle Light Gala and the Octoberfest Car Show. Legal battles over Camarillo Ranch House In 1891, Martina Camarillo deeded the ranch to her sons. Following her death, her daughters, who had only been given $5 each, challenged the will and the deed of the ranch. The daughters also claimed that their brothers had deceived their mother and that Juan Jr. had confessed his guilt to one of the sisters and paid her $8,500. Juan Jr., however, testified that his sisters were trying to blackmail him and send him to jail for an \\"infamous crime.\\" Eventually Adolfo Camarillo was granted control over the ranch.

However, the WAFL refused to clear him and Beard had to sit out of football for a year and was unable to play for Richmond until the 1969 VFL season. He played in nine wins from his first ten games including winning the 1969 VFL Grand Final. He returned to South Fremantle after his three seasons at Richmond but only played 6 games in the 1972 WANFL season before retiring.

Lehmus was the grandson of the German poet Johann Adam Lehmus (1707-1788) and the Berlin-based physician Emilie Lehmus (1841-1932) was his grandniece. His father Christian Balthasar Lehmus was a science teacher and director of a gymnasium in Soest, as such he took it upon himself to school his son. From 1799 to 1802 Lehmus studied at universities of Erlangen and Jena. In 1803 he went to Berlin, where he was giving private lectures in mathematics and pursued further studies at the university, which awarded him a PhD in 1811. From December 18, 1813 to Easter 1815 Lehmus was employed as a lecturer (Privatdozent) by the university, but in 1814 he became a teacher for math and science at the Hauptbergwerks-Eleven- Institut (mining school) in Berlin as well. In 1826 he also assumed a teaching position at the Königlichen Artillerie- und Ingenieurschule (military engineering school) and was granted the title of a professor at that school in 1827. In 1836 he was awarded the Order of the Red Eagle (4th class). In addition to his two teaching positions Lehmus was giving lectures at the university until 1837 as well.Wilhelm Koner: Gelehrtes Berlin im Jahre 1845. T. Scherk 1846, p. 209 () (German)Siegmund Günther: Lehmus, Daniel Christian Ludolph. In: Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie (ADB). Volume 18, Duncker & Humblot, Leipzig 1883, p. 147 (German) Lehmus wrote a number of math and science textbooks, best known was probably his Lehrbuch der Geometrie, which saw several editions. He published articles in various math journals, in particular he was a regular contributor to Crelle's Journal and provided an article for its very first edition in 1826. He published an elegant trigonometric solution of Malfatti's problem in the French math journal Nouvelles Annales de Mathématiques, but due to a copy error the author's name was given as Lechmütz. In 1840 Lehmus wrote a letter to the French mathematician C. Sturm asking him for an elementary geometric proof of the theorem that is now named after him. Sturm passed the problem on to other mathematicians and Jakob Steiner was one of the first who provided a proof. In 1850 Lehmus came up with a different proof on his own. The theorem itself proved to be a rather popular topic in elementary geometry being a subject of somewhat regular publications for over 160 years.Coxeter, H. S. M. and Greitzer, S.

It is a photoreceptor protein sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) light. The OPN5 gene was discovered in mouse and human genomes and its mRNA expression was also found in neural tissues. Neuropsin is bistable at 0 °C and activates a UV-sensitive, heterotrimeric G protein Gi-mediated pathway in mammalian and avian tissues.  Function  Opsins are members of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. Human neuropsin is expressed in the eye, brain, testes, and spinal cord. Neuropsin belongs to the seven-exon subfamily of mammalian opsin genes that includes peropsin (RRH) and retinal G protein coupled receptor (RGR). Neuropsin has different isoforms created by alternative splicing.  Photochemistry  When reconstituted with 11-cis-retinal, mouse and human neuropsins absorb maximally at 380 nm. When illuminated these neuropsins are converted into blue-absorbing photoproducts (470 nm), which are stable in the dark. The photoproducts are converted back to the UV-absorbing form, when they are illuminated with orange light (> 520 nm).  Phylogeny  The neuropsins constitute one of the four subclades of the Go/RGR group of opsins, also known as RGR/Go or Group 4. Go/RGR is one of the four major subclades of type-II opsins, also known as metazoan or animal opsins. Go/RGR comprises Go-coupled, RGR, peropsins, and neuropsins. Type-II opsins comprise four subclades: C-opsins (ciliary), R-opsins (rhabdomeric), Cnidops (cnidarian), and Go/RGR. Three of these subclades occur only in Bilateria (all but Cnidops). However, the bilaterian clades constitute a parphyletic taxon without Cnidops.  Species Distribution  Neuropsin and its orthologs have been found experimentally in a small number of animals, among them human, house mouse (Mus musculus), chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus), the Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica), the European brittle star Amphiura filiformis (related to starfish), the tardigrade water bear (Hypsibius dujardini), and the tadpole of Xenopus laevis. Searches of publicly available databases of genetic sequences have found putative neuropsin orthologs in both major branches of Bilateria: protostomes and deuterostomes. Among protostomes, putative neuropsins have been found in the molluscs owl limpet (Lottia gigantea) (a species of sea snail) and Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), in the water flea (Daphnia pulex) (an arthropod), and in the annelid worm Capitella teleta.

Signaling  The inositol phosphate (IP3) accumulation, aequorin, and 35S isotope binding assays in overexpressing HEK293 cells have demonstrated coupling of GPR97 to Gαo protein triggering cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). GPR97 actives cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), NF-κB, and small GTPases to regulate cellular functions.  Function  Systemic steroid exposure is a therapy to treat a variety of medical conditions and is associated with epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation that may reflect pharmacological responses and/or side effects. GPR97 was found to be differently methylated at CpG sites in the genome of blood cells from patient under systemic steroid treatment. GPR97 is transcribed in immune cells. Gene-deficient mice revealed that Gpr97 is crucial for maintaining B-cell population via constitutive CREB and NF-κB activities. Human lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) abundantly express GPR97. Silencing GPR97 in human LECs indicated that GPR97 modulates cytoskeletal rearrangement, cell adhesion and migration through regulating the small GTPase RhoA and cdc42.

Biography Lounsbury was born in Ridgefield, Connecticut on January 10, 1841. He worked on his father's farm and attended the local schools. He married Jennie Wright. Career In New York City, he secured a position as clerk in a shoe store, and in time familiarized himself with all departments of the business. When the civil war broke out Lounsbury enlisted as a private in the Seventeenth Connecticut Regiment, but after four months' active service was compelled by severe sickness to return, being honorably discharged and recommended for a pension, which he would not accept. Having laid the foundations for a successful commercial career; he began, upon attaining his majority in 1862, the manufacture of shoes in New Haven under the firm name of Lounsbury Brothers. The business was afterward moved to South Norwalk, and carried on under the firm name of Lounsbury, Matthewson & Co. Lounsbury became a member of the Connecticut House of Representatives in 1874 and held that position till 1876. Winning the 1886 Republican gubernatorial nomination, Lounsbury was elected governor by a legislative decision. During his term, he signed the Incorrigible Criminal Act. He also advocated for instituting a 60-hour work week for women and children under 16. He did not run for re-election and retired from public service. After serving as the governor of Connecticut, Lounsbury returned to his business and served as president of the Connecticut Merchants Exchange National Bank. His brother and business partner, George E. Lounsbury, served as governor from 1899 to 1901. In 1883, he built a Great Camp, Echo Camp, on Raquette Lake in the Adirondack. Death Lounsbury died in Ridgefield, Connecticut on June 22, 1925. He is interred at Lounsbury Cemetery, Ridgefield, Fairfield County, Connecticut.

At the snap, Baltimore defensive lineman Keith Washington bullrushed the Titans lineman defending him, losing his helmet in the process; undeterred, Washington stretched out his right arm over his head, deflecting Del Greco's kick high into the air. Mitchell snatched the tipped ball out of the air at the Ravens' 10-yard line, raced up the far sideline and, with the help of blocks thrown by backup safety Corey Harris and starting cornerback Chris McAlister, returned the ball 90 yards for a Baltimore touchdown.

In 2006, ADEA instituted open membership, which increased the number of ADEA member institutions and engaged their faculty, staff, students, residents and fellows in the association’s work and goals. The mission of ADEA is to lead institutions and individuals in the dental education community to address contemporary issues influencing education, research and the delivery of oral health care for the overall health and safety of the public. ADEA institutional members include all 76 U.S. and Canadian dental schools, over 800 allied and advanced dental education programs and 66 corporations working in oral health education. ADEA individual members are numbered at more than 20,000 faculty, staff, deans, program directors and students. Dental education is a broad and varied field that trains people as general dentists, specialists, dental hygienists, dental assistants, and dental laboratory technicians. ADEA membership mirrors this diversity, so the association has 38 sections: academic affairs, anatomical sciences, behavioral science, biochemistry, nutrition, and microbiology, business and financial administration, cariology, clinic administration, community and preventative dentistry, comprehensive care and general dentistry, continuing education, dental anatomy and occlusion, dental assisting education, dental hygiene education, dental informatics, dental school admissions officers, development, alumni affairs, and public relations, educational research/development and curriculum, endodontics, gay-straight alliance, gerontology and geriatrics education, graduate and postgraduate education, minority affairs, operative dentistry and biomaterials, oral biology, oral diagnosis/oral medicine, oral and maxillofacial radiology, orthodontics, pediatric dentistry, periodontics, physiology, pharmacology, and therapeutics, postdoctoral general dentistry, practice management, prosthodontics, student affairs and financial aid, and substance abuse, addiction and tobacco dependence education; and ten special interest groups: career development for the new educator, dental hygiene clinic coordinators, foreign-educated dental professionals, graduate dental hygiene education programs, implant dentistry, lasers in dentistry, professional, ethical, and legal issues in dentistry, scholarship of teaching and learning, and teaching and learning with emerging technologies. ADEA also fosters interconnected community experiences that enable members to meet their individual goals while leveraging their collective strength: * ADEA provides valuable support to entering students through its Division of Educational Pathways, which supports four application services: ADEA AADSAS (predoctoral programs), ADEA PASS (postdoctoral programs), ADEA CAAPID (postdoctoral programs for international dentists) and ADEA DHCAS (dental hygiene programs). * ADEA encourages students from diverse backgrounds to learn about careers in dentistry as early as elementary school. Programs such as ExploreHealthCareers.org, the Summer Medical and Dental Education Program, and the W.K. Kellogg/ADEA Minority Dental Faculty Development Program all assist underrepresented minority students in realizing their career goals. * For dental educators, ADEA offers ongoing opportunities to advance their skills and knowledge. The ADEA Leadership Institute and the ADEA Allied Dental Faculty Leadership Development Program cultivate leadership skills. Webinars, fellowship programs and numerous meetings (including the ADEA Annual Session & Exhibition) offer educational programming and networking to educators at all career stages. * ADEA publishes the peer-reviewed Journal of Dental Education, the Bulletin of Dental Education, the ADEA Official Guide to Dental Schools, surveys and reports on the state of dental education, policy briefs and much more. ADEA determines best practices for dental education and encourages change in dental education programs and institutions that will benefit everyone. The ADEA Commission on Change and Innovation in Dental Education (ADEA CCI) has engaged representatives from each U.S. dental school specifically to examine dental school curricula. ADEA contributes to solving oral health care problems by encouraging excellence in dental education, research and patient care, and provides financial support for dental education, research, and leadership through the ADEAGies Foundation. The Gies Foundation was established in 1950, by colleagues and admirers or Dr. William J. Gies, a Columbia University biochemistry professor. Dr. Gies is best known for his 1926 landmark report on dental education in the United States and Canada. Dr. Gies published over 600 articles, pamphlets and books.

The communications part of SOC Enterprise communications have traditionally been provided by closed, stand-alone PBX systems. Installed in a separate phone room or wiring closet, operated over a different wiring infrastructure, known only by the telecom manager, these systems ran independently from every other aspect of the business. Today’s business-savvy chief information officers (CIOs) are exploring ways in which information technology can be better leveraged to improve the efficiency and productivity of the enterprise. In practice, CIOs are embracing the concepts of service-oriented architectures and rethinking how the different business systems in use within the enterprise can be designed to allow each system to leverage the benefits of any other system. The maturing of web service technology has provided a real framework for allowing one system to leverage the services of another according to the principles of a service-oriented architecture. Complex business systems can now work together to deliver solutions in highly customized ways to end users. Increasingly, applications are adapting to the specific needs of users rather than users being forced to adapt to the available functionality of applications.  Web service technology  As the Internet grew from a forum for sharing information to a marketplace for doing business, a technology matured that allowed computers to transact with each other more easily. Out of these Internet roots, web service technology was born. The general goal of web services is to construct elements of business logic, services, which can be very easily used by other applications. The services themselves hide the complexity of their business logic from the consumers through simple interfaces that allow the services to be reused in many different applications. The service and the consumer are described as being loosely coupled, an approach that allows complex composite solutions to be developed through leveraging multiple web services. There are a number of key elements to web service technology… * XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is the core language of web service technology. It provides a platform neutral way to describe the data associated with any service transaction. * SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is the preferred means by which an application invokes a web service. The protocol itself is written in XML. * WSDL (Web Services Description Language) is the specification of the interface that a web service exposes to consumers. It describes the set of operations that the service makes available. The WSDL is also written in XML. Advantages of web services * Loosely coupled—the high degree of abstraction that exists between the implementation and the consumption of the service frees the web service client and the web service provider from needing any knowledge of each other beyond inputs and outputs * Platform neutral—web services can be provided by or invoked on most, if not all, platforms today, even legacy platforms * Development language neutral—people are developing web services using C/C++, C#, Java, Visual Basic, Python and others * Standards are architecture neutral—these do not enforce client–server, peer-to-peer or any other model, although practical implementation issues currently drive developers to client–server * Web services leverage existing standards—standards that are already in place for conventional web server applications, including HTTP, secure sockets and authentication * Relatively lightweight—so they can be easily deployed to small devices for example PDAs and SmartPhones.

Biography Coffin was born in Mansfield, New York. He studied at Cortland Academy and the Charlottesville Seminary. At seventeen he went to New York to be a salesman for a mercantile house, and two years later, in 1855, he became the New York representative of a prominent Connecticut manufacturing firm. In 1858, he married Ellen Elizabeth Coe, and they had two children. When the American Civil War broke out in 1861, he was a strong supporter of the Union, but physically barred from active service. However, he served two terms as president of the Brooklyn YMCA and was active in the New York Committee of the United States Christian Commission. Career In 1864, Coffin moved to Connecticut. He was president of the Middlesex Mutual (Fire) Assurance Company from 1865 to 1878. He was secretary and treasurer of the Farmers and Mechanics Savings Bank of Middletown, and he held the same offices and that of director for several years in the old Air Line Railroad Company. From 1872 to 1874 he was mayor of Middletown. In 1875, he was president of the Middlesex County Agricultural Society. A member of the Connecticut Senate for the 22nd District, he served in 1887 and also in 1889. In 1894 he became a member of the Connecticut Society of the Sons of the American Revolution. Governor of Connecticut In 1894 Coffin was nominated for governor and elected by the greatest majority recorded up to that time. During his term, a legislation was passed that prohibited the use of convict labor in the production of food, drugs, and tobacco products. Several other changes also took place. A state board of mediation and arbitration was instituted, and a bill was enacted that disallowed children under the age of 14 from working, and a bill was constituted that enabled a worker's right to join a labor union. Coffin left office on January 6, 1897, but stayed active in his business ventures, and in his civic and religious dealings. He received the honorary degree of LL.D. from Wesleyan University and is an honorary member of the college fraternity Delta Kappa Epsilon. Death Coffin enjoyed shooting and fishing, and for years he was president of the Middletown Rifle Association as well as the vice-president of the Connecticut Rifle Association. He died on January 13, 1921, and is interred at Indian Hill Cemetery, Middletown, Connecticut. References External links * Sobel, Robert and John Raimo.

The 90/60 and 90/70 were repackaged Univac 9700 computers. After the RCA acquisition by Sperry, it was determined that the RCA TSOS operating system was far more advanced than the Univac counterpart, so the company opted to merge the Univac hardware with the RCA software and introduced the 90/70. The 90/60 was introduced shortly thereafter as a slower, less expensive 90/70. It was not until the introduction of the 90/80 that VS/9 finally had a hardware platform optimized to take full advantage of its capability to allow both interactive and batch operations on the same computer. Background In September 1971, RCA decided to exit the mainframe computer business after losing about half a billion dollars trying (and failing) to compete against IBM. Most of the assets of the computer division were sold to what was then Univac. This included RCA's Spectra series of computers, various external hardware designs (such as video terminals, tape drives and punched card readers), and its operating system, Time Sharing Operating System (TSOS). TSOS may have been a better operating system from a user standpoint than any of IBM's, but at the time, operating systems were not considered something sold separately from the computer, the manufacturer included it free as part of the purchase price. Univac introduced some additional new features to TSOS, and renamed it VS/9. The name 'TSOS' however, remained as the username of the primary privileged (System Manager) account, which on Unix-type systems, is called 'root'. RCA also sold TSOS to what would become Fujitsu, and it is the basis for Fujitsu's BS2000 operating system on its mainframes of the same name. Use Interactive use Interactive use of VS/9 was done through terminals connected to a terminal concentrator unit, which passed control signals to and from the terminals, in a manner similar to the way IBM would provide with its IBM 3270-style terminals. This provided, in general, for input to the terminal to be sent in response to an enter key, as opposed to the practice on PCs of taking input one character at a time. The concentrator unit was originally known as the Communications Control Module, or CCM. However, RCA had sold the patents and designs for its CCM terminal controller to Singer Corporation, so Univac developed an emulator device for the CCM which was known as the Multiterminal Connection Controller model 16, or MCC-16. The MCC-16 supported both the Univac standard terminal (from RCA) renamed to the Uniscope Video Display Terminal or VDT, as well as ordinary ASCII dumb terminals. Univac's Uniscope VDT provided sophisticated (for the time) editing capability including the ability to edit text on screen and make changes a line at a time or a page at a time, then transmit the text back to the computer. The VDT also supported direct cursor positioning and input protection through a cursor which indicated that only text after the cursor was to be recognized. It also supported special scroll mode in a subset of the screen, or \\"window\\" in which, instead of the entire screen scrolling upward when the last line is displayed, it was possible to make the scroll area only the bottom half of the screen. (The same feature for \\"split screen scroll\\" would become available about 20 years later in the Apple II microcomputer.) A distinction was made between interactive (timesharing) terminals and transactional terminals. Where interactive terminals were controlled directly by the operating system, transactional terminals were controlled from a batch program. Initially, this batch program, known as MCP for Multichannel Communications Program, was developed for the RCA and Sperry batch-oriented operating systems, TDOS (Tape-Disk Operating System) and DOS (Disk Operating System). Once it became clear that they would be phased out in favor of the much more robust interactive operating system, VMOS, MCP was ported to run on VMOS. VMOS (Virtual Memory Operating System) became the new moniker for TSOS on RCA Spectra 70 models 46, 61, 3, and 7 computers, and then initially on Univac Series 70 (formerly RCA) computers. Eventually, MCP was enhanced to support Sperry Univac terminals and its name was changed to COS (Communication Operating System). Ports in the CCM and later in the MCC running in emulation mode could be designated either interactive or transactional, but not both. If a port was designated an interactive port, it was controlled by the timesharing services integrated into the VMOS or VS/9 operating system. Transactional ports, on the other hand, were controlled by COS. All terminals connected to these ports became the \\"property\\" of the respective controlling host software. Timesharing was used for program development allowing much faster program development than the traditional batch process which was state of the art at the time. Each timesharing user was a task by itself and could execute programs, create files, and request system resources as needed. What made much of this possible was the operating system's ability to manage \\"virtual memory\\", or temporarily save pages of memory (including executing programs) to disk or drum while not in use and then retrieve them later as needed. Virtual memory page size was fixed at 4096 bytes. This allowed many more tasks to be running simultaneously than would otherwise be constrained by limited and expensive main memory space. Transactional users, on the other hand, were all controlled by a single program and their view of the environment was limited to that which was presented to them. They were not identified as individual tasks and did not have the ability to run programs or request system resources. The CCM and the MCC running in emulation mode were \\"dumb\\" hardware interfaces. That is, all the network protocol intelligence, including terminal polling, error recovery, and message construction resided in the mainframe, while the CCM and MCC simply acted as conduits between the mainframe and the phone lines. It was not until the MCC was used as a true front end processor that much of this overhead (such as polling and error recovery) was offloaded from the mainframe, thus freeing up computer time for running application programs. This did not occur until the VS/9 era. Batch use VS/9 supported one or more card readers, which were connected to the computer and activated by the user placing a card deck in the hopper and pressing the \\"Start\\" button. Presumably, the computer would read the source deck, and place all of the cards read in the output hopper. If the card deck consisted of a valid login, it would process the card deck as a job to execute. Site Operations VS/9 was controlled by a computer operator at the central site. Computer operators interacted with the system through a system console. Initially, this console was a teletype device, but was later upgraded to a video display device with an attached system console printer. All system console messages were logged to the system console printer. Unsolicited messages originating in the operating system were also logged to the system console printer. Computer operators had a number of responsibilities: * Initialize the system through a boot process. * Start batch program processes. * Load the communication control program (MCP or COS) if the site had transactional terminals. * Supply input data via punched cards or magnetic tapes. * Mount/dismount removable disks and tapes as needed for batch and/or interactive tasks. * Prioritize jobs executing or in the input queues. * Adjust batch and interactive terminal limits to optimize system performance. * Supply paper for the onsite, locally connected printers. * Report system malfunctions to vendor maintenance personnel. * Perform other duties as specified by the customer management team. Features Volume Groups One of the more useful enhancements late in the life of VS/9 was volume groups. Disk technology at the time provided limited storage space on each disk. Since disk drives were comparatively large and quite expensive, manufacturers of disk drives provided the capability to physically remove the actual disk from the device and replace it with another. Customers thus had the ability to store many times the capacity of their disk drives, albeit they could not necessarily be used simultaneously unless there were enough free disk drives. Limited disk storage space also presented users with another problem. Very often files would be larger than could be contained on one disk. Volume groups helped mitigate this technological problem by allowing files to span multiple disks. Volumes (disks) that had to be mounted simultaneously were designated a \\"volume group\\". Owners could be defined in order to limit access to sensitive data. Once mounted and attached to an active task, the entire volume group could not be dismounted until all attached tasks either released it or terminated. Every disk available to the system was part of a volume group, even if there was only one volume in the group. Volume groups could be designated as removable or fixed. Fixed volume groups could not be removed at any time. This was necessary for disks that housed the operating system and the files that supported the transactional terminals. Remote Batch Processing Remote Batch Processing (RBP) was a capability that existed in VS/9, although it was never completely exploited, probably due to limited demand. RBP allowed remote users to submit batch jobs for execution on the mainframe and receive the results back at their offsite printer. Typically, a remote batch device consisted of a card reader and a printer connected to a communication line which interfaced with the remote batch services in the operating system. Like a local batch job, operators could receive requests for tape or disk mounts/dismounts and program prompts for responses to questions. Task Types VS/9 managed tasks by task type. Task types could be either executing programs or queues of pending tasks. The following were the task types used by VS/9: # Batch input queue # Executing batch programs # Active timesharing users # Print and punch spool output queue # Print and punch devices printing or punching # RBP output queue # Not used # RBP devices printing MCP and COS were always type 2 tasks. The computer operator would see a count of the number of tasks within each queue on the system console. A complete list of the task queues was available from any interactive terminal with administrator access via a field-written program known as \\"Stat200\\". This program would scan the task queues every few seconds and display a rolling list of tasks on the terminal screen until it was interrupted or terminated. While not an officially released product, it became the de facto standard for task monitoring. Account access VS/9 controlled access through the use of an account name and a user name. The account name was a 1 to 7 character identifier, and the user name was also a 1 to 8 character identifier. Identifiers for account names and user names could only be letters and numbers. The account name was the equivalent of a directory name under Unix-style user accounts, with the note that the user name indicated which person sharing that account was the party using it. Thus, for example, if there was an account name of S0103, if there were two users, whose name were Pat and Leslie in that account, they would have a complete identifier of S0103,PAT and S0103,LESLIE. All of their files would be stored in the directory S0103 and thus, they could not create files with the same name. Note that if there was an account name of, say, PA5, if there was a user named Pat, their identifier would be PA5,PAT and would be completely unrelated to any other user named Pat. Accounts could be given restrictions such as requiring a password to use, limits on amount of files, amount of usage, time of permitted usage (such as only allowing logons after 5 p.m. or before 8 a.m.) and CPU limits. A user could also issue commands to have the system interrupt a program if the current session used more than a certain amount of wall-clock or cpu time. A user at a terminal that was not logged on, who wanted to start a session would press the red Transmit key on a Univac VDT, or use Control-C on an ASCII terminal. VS/9 would issue the following response: :Welcome to the VS/9 terminal system. Please logon. Followed by a slash (\\"/\\"), and in the case of the Univac VDT, the prompt character, which looked like an inverse color greater than sign (\\">\\"). The user would logon by typing the word 'logon followed by their identifier, e.g. their account name, a comma, and their user name. If they had a password on their account, they would type a comma followed by their password, which could be from 1 to 4 characters. If it contained one or more spaces (other than trailing spaces, which could be omitted), it had to be typed in single quotes. If it contained non-printable or binary characters, it had to by typed in by using the letter X followed by a quote and the 8-character hexadecimal value of their password. So if the account S0103 had the password (in hexadecimal) A0B0C0 and a space, then user LESLIE would logon to the system by typing :/LOGON S0103,LESLIE,X'A0B0C0' If their credentials were incorrect, either because the account name, user name or password were incorrect, they would get the message, :Logon invalid, please try again. and would be given a / prompt to logon again. If their credentials were correct, then if the system manager (the owner of account $TSOS) had posted a system message, it would display at this time. The user would be at command mode, and a standard / prompt would appear where they could type various commands. The user would finish their session by typing LOGOFF and pressing transmit on the Univac VDT or Control-C on an ascii terminal. Terminal functions Univac's VDT terminal had four function keys at the top, and VS/9 specifically recognized them. * F1 was the equivalent to the break key on an Ascii terminal. If a program was running, it would be interrupted, and the user would enter break mode, in which they could issue a command. They could type R or INTR to resume running the program where the break had been struck. * F2 and F3 could be set up to be recognized by a program for various functions, but were not used by VS/9. * F4 performed an immediate forced logoff of the user if struck, by accident or on purpose. This would be the equivalent on MS-DOS of pressing CTRL-ALT-DEL, which force- reboots the machine immediately. System commands VS/9 accepted commands by typing the command and any options. Commands issued in a batch stream either as cards or as a batch file required that they be preceded by a slash; commands entered at a terminal did not require use of the slash. Commands included the following: * EXEC to load and run a program * LOAD to load a program into memory and break to command mode without running, to allow debugging commands * DO to run a batch file in the current session * ENTER to run a batch file as if it had been submitted to the card reader * SYSFILE to specify the disposition of printed output * LOGOFF to end one's session. If someone was going to use the terminal, or they wanted to change accounts, they could also type LOGOFF BUT to issue an immediate request for a new login. Any printed output the user had generated during their session would be spooled to the line printer and printed at this time. The option 'TAPE' could be used, as in \\"LOGOFF TAPE\\", \\"LOGOFF BUT,TAPE\\" or \\"LOGOFF TAPE,BUT\\" to indicate that pending printed output should be spooled to magnetic tape instead of being printed. A request would be sent to the system operator. If one had issued a break to a running program (through the Break key on an ASCII terminal or the F1 key on a Univac VDT) or had used the LOAD command instead of EXEC, one would be in \\"break mode\\" in which the program was suspended to allow the user to be at command mode. They could issue the above commands as well the following: *R to resume a program interrupted by the break key *INTR to issue an Interrupt-Resume to a program supporting INTR *Debugging commands :VS/9 included the Interactive Debugging Aid (IDA) which provided commands to view memory and registers, trap program errors, and store memory in locations. Unlike other systems where an interactive debugger required either you run a program to use it or link a module into a program, IDA was a part of the operating system and its commands were available from break mode. :Another very helpful, but unsupported product for debugging operating system problems was a program called \\"CareCity\\". The VS/9 operating system was supplied as pre-assembled modules on magnetic tapes. During installation, selected modules were linked together based on the configuration parameters supplied to form the functioning operating system and then saved to disk. Each module had a designated free space at the end, which was used to patch existing code in the event of an error, without re-assembling the entire module. CareCity enabled the administrator to view the operating system memory contents using addresses relative to the start of each operating system module. Patch code could then be inserted into the designated patch areas as needed and then branches from existing code to the newly installed code could be inserted. This could all be done while the operating system was in use. File name conventions File names could be up to 56 characters in length. A file could consist of letters, numbers, dashes, and digits. A file name of all digits was permissible, but a file could not have two consecutive periods. To access a file in another account, it was necessary for a user in that account to make the file public. If the file was public, it could be accessed by another user by prefixing the name of the file with the indicator that a file being referenced is in another account, which was the dollar sign (\\"$\\"), followed by the account name, followed by a period. If there was a file named \\"A\\" in account S0103, and a user in account PA5 wanted to access the file in account S0103, first, the file would have to be marked as public, and second, it would have to be referenced by account name and the name of the file. So a user in account PA5 who wanted to access file A in account S0103, if the file was public, would reference it as \\"$S0103.A\\". Note that a user in account S0103 could reference the file simply as \\"A\\" or could reference it with a fully qualified file name by including a dollar sign and their own account name, followed by a period and the name. Public files in the special account TSOS could be accessed by using $ alone as the first character of the file, unless the file began with a name that was identical to an account number, in which case the explicit account reference $TSOS. would be required. Also, $TSOS. was what would be called the path name for missing files referenced by name which were not found in the user's account. For example, if there was a file called S0103.XYZZY in account $TSOS, and there was an account on that system named S0103, any user wanting to access it would have to access it as \\"$TSOS.S0103.XYZZY\\". TSOS was also the \\"default\\" account for a file that was referenced that did not exist locally. For example, to execute the EDT editor program, one would issue the command to run a program, EXEC, followed by the name of the file, which was called EDT. So, if the user had not created a file named EDT, they could execute the EDT editor by typing :/EXEC EDT and pressing the transmit key. If they had, for some reason, created a program of the same name, to use the system editor, they would have to type :/EXEC $EDT or they could explicitly type in the system account :/EXEC $TSOS.EDT When Unisys discontinued sales of the 9000 series mainframes in favor of the EXEC 8 series computers (probably because they were no longer cost effective, and the market for mainframes had shrank), VS/9 was effectively abandoned by the company.

HCA2 activation inhibits lipolytic and atherogenic activity (i.e., it inhibits the breakdown of fats and the development of atherosclerosis), induces vasodilation (i.e., the dilation of blood vessels), and is responsible for mediating niacin-induced flushing.  Function  HCA2 is a high-affinity Gi/Go-coupled G protein- coupled receptor (GPCR) for nicotinic acid (niacin), and is a member of the nicotinic acid receptor family of GPCRs. HCA2 activation inhibits lipolytic and atherogenic activity (i.e., it inhibits the breakdown of fats and the development of atherosclerosis), induces vasodilation (i.e., the dilation of blood vessels), and is responsible for niacin-induced flushing.  5-oxo-ETE  The mouse ortholog of HCA2, Niacr1, has been proposed to mediate the ability of 5-oxo-ETE, a member of the 5-HETE family of eicosanoids, to stimulate the production of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein mRNA, Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, and thereby progesterone in mouse cultured MA-10 Leydig cells. Human tissues respond to 5-oxo-ETE and other 5-HETE family members though the OXER1 G protein-coupled receptor. The roles, if any, of Niacr1 in the response of leydig cells to other 5-HETE family members, of Niacr1 in the response of other mouse cells to 5-HETE family members, and the role of HCA2 in the response of human tissues to 5-HETE family members has not been determined.  Clinical significance  HCA2 is an important biomolecular target of niacin which is a widely prescribed drug for the treatment of dyslipidemia and to increase HDL cholesterol but whose therapeutic use is limited by flushing. In HCA2 knockout mice, the effects of niacin on both lipids and flushing is eliminated. Furthermore, in arrestin beta 1 knockout mice, niacin's effect on flushing is greatly reduced while the lipid modifying effects are maintained. At high doses, niacin produces marked anti-inflammatory effects in a variety of tissues – including the brain, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and vascular tissue – through activation of HCA2. Niacin has also been shown to attenuate neuroinflammation in part through NIACR1 binding; consequently, HCA2 has been identified as a potential therapeutic target for treating neuroimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. The precise mechanism of action of niacin therapeutic effects has not been fully elucidated, but appears to work in part through activation of HCA2 which reduces the levels of intracellular cAMP thereby inhibiting lipolysis in adipocytes. In contrast, the flushing effect is due to HCA2 activation of ERK 1/2 MAP kinase mediated by arrestin beta 1. Activation of MAP kinase in turn causes release of prostaglandin D2 from Langerhans cells in the skin. Ligands Full agonists of HCA2 include: * -β-Hydroxybutyric acid and β-hydroxybutyrate * Butyric acid and butyrate Figure 1: Microbial-derived molecules promote colonic Treg differentiation. * Niacin (also known as vitamin B3 and nicotinic acid)  References  G protein-coupled receptors ","title":"Hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2"},{"id":"14446533","text":"TAB Trackside is a New Zealand horse racing and sports broadcast network, incorporating two pay TV channels. The TV channels are available on Sky channels and Vodafone TV IPTV channels 062 and 063. The radio station broadcasts on 14 AM radio and 16 FM radio frequencies from Kaitaia to Invercargill were suspended on 12 April 2020. Together, the outlets provide full coordinated coverage of all thoroughbred horse racing, harness horse racing and greyhound racing in New Zealand, most racing from Australia, and many races from Hong Kong, Singapore and other countries. The channels provides tickers and commentary with up-to-the-minute odds, field and dividend information. Between races, they feature on-track interviews, in-studio analysis, live footage of horses warming up for races, replays of previous races, and recaps of betting odds. The live broadcasting of horse racing in the New Zealand dates back to the launch of a racing radio network in 1978. The station, originally known as Radio Pacific and later as bSport and LiveSport, became TAB Trackside Radio. A racing television station launched in 1992, initially known as Action TV and later as Trackside, is now TAB Trackside 1. A second racing television station launched in 2007, known initially as TAB TV, is now TAB Trackside 2. History Radio Pacific This was the Radio Pacific logo in 1991. Racing network Radio Pacific began in Auckland in 1978, and became one of the first stations to be networked across the country in the early 1990s. The network combined news, news talkback, sports talkback and live racing commentaries. Radio Pacific became a listed company on the New Zealand Stock Exchange and the Totalisator Agency Board became its major shareholder. Radio Pacific's Waikato station began as Radio Waikato, New Zealand's third privately owned station. It originally broadcast in 930AM in 1971, before moving 954AM in 1978. In 1986 Radio Waikato changed to a country music format and was renamed Country Gold - Waikato 954. In 1988 it was sold to Radio Pacific and transitioned into a local talk radio format with national racing commentary. It changed its name to Radio Pacific and eventually replaced local programmes with Auckland networked programmes. A new station of the same name also operated in Hamilton between 1993 and 1994. Other radio stations This was the LiveSport logo in 2010. The company also owned the North Island music station group Energy Enterprises and merged with the South Island radio company Radio Otago in 1999. Between May 2000 and January 2001 it was purchased by CanWest Global Communications, becoming part of RadioWorks and later part of MediaWorks New Zealand. Part of the company was purchased in July 2004, and the entire company was sold off in June 2007.Decision No. 294 Commerce Commission, Wellington New Zealand, 1997. Before 2005 live races and betting odds had been broadcast on Radio Pacific in pre-determined, limited periods during the race day under a contract with the New Zealand Racing Board. Between 2001 and 2005, this was also complemented by a trial Radio Trackside station in the Southland market dedicated to racing coverage. In 2005 MediaWorks launched new talkback network Radio Live and moved many of Radio Pacific's talkback personalities across to the new network. John Banks continued to host Radio Pacific's breakfast programme, and Alice Worsley and Martin Crump co-hosted a new morning talkback programme. A Trackside TV simulcast, branded as Radio Trackside, was broadcast in the afternoon. On 29 October 2007 Radio Pacific became BSport and its tagline became \\"BSport, the station you can bet on\\". The general talkback format was replaced with a sports talkback format. MediaWorks New Zealand and Trackside shared the network's Auckland studios, with live sports talk and betting odds in the morning, and live races and betting odds in the afternoon. In January 2010 BSport was renamed LiveSport, the sister network to Radio Live. It became TAB Trackside Radio on 13 April 2015, when it came under the full ownership of the New Zealand Racing Board. The radio simulcast on the AM and FM frequencies was suspended on 12 April 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19. The suspension would be reviewed once the resumption of New Zealand racing was confirmed. The simulcast of racing continues on the TAB website, TAB app and via third party apps. Television TAB Trackside began television broadcasting in 1992 as Action TV - a free-to-air UHF station that only broadcast during live racing events. In 1993, it changed its name to Trackside. From 1994, Sky Television began using broadcasting Discovery Channel to subscribers when Trackside was in closedown. The station received a dedicated channel on the new Sky Digital platform in 1999, which began broadcasting 18 hours a day from 2004 and 24 hours a day from 2007. In addition to live New Zealand racing, the channel introduced racing replay, preview and review shows, and live racing and racing shows from Australia. The channel began broadcasting on Freeview Satellite from 2 May 2007, on Freeview terrestrial on 14 April 2008, and in widescreen from 15 December 2008. In October 2009, TAB introduced a second channel - TAB TV - to accommodate live racing from Hong Kong and Singapore. In October 2013 it changed the TVNZ metadata on the Freeview satellite service to unlock access to Trackside TV, keeping TAB TV as a pay-TV channel. On 14 April 2014, it ceased operations on Freeview, becoming only available to Sky subscribers. In August 2014, Trackside TV and TAB TV were relaunched as TAB Trackside 1 and TAB Trackside 2, extending racing coverage from all codes and enabling up to 5000 additional races to be broadcast each year that were previously not scheduled.

He became a master of the Antwerp Guild of St. Luke in 1567 and was its deacon in 1587. His younger brothers Hieronymus Francken I and Ambrosius Francken I both became successful painters. The early biographer Karel van Mander stated that Frans Francken the Elder was a pupil of the leading Antwerp Mannerist painter Frans Floris.Frans Francken in Karel van Mander's Schilder-boeck, 1604 In 1571 he collaborated with his older brother Hieronymus on a large Adoration of the Magi triptych (Brussels, Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium and London, Brompton Oratory) which bears his monogram as well as that of his younger brother Frans.

At the time of his death in 1619 their surviving children were Thomas, Frans, Hieronymus, Ambrosius II, Magdalena and Elisabeth. His pupils included his son Frans, Gortzius Geldorp, Herman van der Mast and Jan de Wael. Work Frans Francken the Elder worked mainly on altar pieces as there was a great demand for such works as a result of the iconoclasm of the Calvinists. His masterpiece is a triptych entitled Christ among the Scribes, which was made for the Antwerp Cathedral in 1587. The figures are rather wooden in the late Mannerist style. However, the heads show the artist’s skill for portraiture. Frans Francken I was also a portrait painter and a few court portraits have been attributed to him. The Battle of Time against Death His earliest paintings were in the style of Frans Floris but after 1600 he developed his own style which displayed classicising characteristics not unlike those in the work of Otto van Veen.Franks Francken I, in: Walter A. Liedtke, Flemish Paintings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 1984, p. 224 Frans Francken the Elder painted small-scale cabinet pictures, a genre in which his sons Frans and Hieronymus would excel.

The pinned dislocation expands and wraps around repeatedly forming new dislocation loops. In materials science, a Frank–Read source is a mechanism explaining the generation of multiple dislocations in specific well-spaced slip planes in crystals when they are deformed. When a crystal is deformed, in order for slip to occur, dislocations must be generated in the material. This implies that, during deformation, dislocations must be primarily generated in these planes. Cold working of metal increases the number of dislocations by the Frank–Read mechanism. Higher dislocation density increases yield strength and causes work hardening of metals. The mechanism of dislocation generation was proposed by and named after British physicist Charles Frank and Thornton Read. History Charles Frank detailed the history of the discovery from his perspective in Proceedings of the Royal Society in 1980. In 1950 Charles Frank, who was then a research fellow in the physics department at the University of Bristol, visited the United States to participate in a conference on crystal plasticity in Pittsburgh. Frank arrived in the United States well in advance of the conference to spend time at a naval laboratory and to give a lecture at Cornell University. When, during his travels in Pennsylvania, Frank visited Pittsburgh, he received a letter from fellow scientist Jock Eshelby suggesting that he read a recent paper by Gunther Leibfried. Frank was supposed to board a train to Cornell to give his lecture at Cornell, but before departing for Cornell he went to the library at Carnegie Institute of Technology to obtain a copy of the paper. The library did not yet have the journal with Leibfried's paper, but the staff at the library believed that the journal could be in the recently arrived package from Germany. Frank decided to wait for the library to open the package, which did indeed contain the journal. Upon reading the paper he took a train to Cornell, where he was told to pass the time until 5:00, as the faculty was in meeting. Frank decided to take a walk between 3:00 and 5:00. During those two hours, while considering the Leibfried paper, he formulated the theory for what was later named the Frank–Read source. A couple of days later, he traveled to the conference on crystal plasticity in Pittsburgh where he ran into Thorton Read in the hotel lobby. Upon encountering each other, the two scientists immediately discovered that they had come up with the same idea for dislocation generation almost simultaneously (Frank during his walk at Cornell, and Thornton Read during tea the previous Wednesday) and decided to write a joint paper on the topic. The mechanism for dislocation generation described in that paper is now known as the Frank–Read source. Mechanism Animation illustrating how stress on a Frank–Read source (center) can generate multiple dislocation lines in a crystal. The Frank–Read source is a mechanism based on dislocation multiplication in a slip plane under shear stress. Consider a straight dislocation in a crystal slip plane with its two ends, A and B, pinned. If a shear stress \\\\tau is exerted on the slip plane then a force F=\\\\tau \\\\cdot bx , where b is the Burgers vector of the dislocation and x is the distance between the pinning sites A and B, is exerted on the dislocation line as a result of the shear stress. This force acts perpendicularly to the line, inducing the dislocation to lengthen and curve into an arc. The bending force caused by the shear stress is opposed by the line tension of the dislocation, which acts on each end of the dislocation along the direction of the dislocation line away from A and B with a magnitude of Gb^2, where G is the shear modulus. If the dislocation bends, the ends of the dislocation make an angle with the horizontal between A and B, which gives the line tensions acting along the ends a vertical component acting directly against the force induced by the shear stress. If sufficient shear stress is applied and the dislocation bends, the vertical component from the line tensions, which acts directly against the force caused by the shear stress, grows as the dislocation approaches a semicircular shape. When the dislocation becomes a semicircle, all of the line tension is acting against the bending force induced by the shear stress, because the line tension is perpendicular to the horizontal between A and B. For the dislocation to reach this point, it is thus evident that the equation: : F=\\\\tau \\\\cdot bx =2Gb^2 must be satisfied, and from this we can solve for the shear stress: : \\\\tau=\\\\frac{2Gb} x This is the stress required to generate dislocation from a Frank–Read source. If the shear stress increases any further and the dislocation passes the semicircular equilibrium state, it will spontaneously continue to bend and grow, spiraling around the A and B pinning points, until the segments spiraling around the A and B pinning points collide and cancel. The process results in a dislocation loop around A and B in the slip plane which expands under continued shear stress, and also in a new dislocation line between A and B which, under renewed or continued shear, can continue to generate dislocation loops in the manner just described. A Frank–Read loop can thus generate many dislocations in a plane in a crystal under applied stress. The Frank–Read source mechanism explains why dislocations are primarily generated on certain slip planes; dislocations are primarily generated in just those planes with Frank–Read sources. It is important to note that if the shear stress does not exceed: : \\\\tau=\\\\frac{2Gb} x and the dislocation does not bend past the semicircular equilibrium state, it will not form a dislocation loop and instead revert to its original state.

Biography Cooke was born in New Marlborough, Massachusetts the Son of Levi Cooke and Amelia (Todd) Cooke. He was educated at Norfolk Academy in Connecticut, For several years after high school, he taught school in the Norfolk area in the winter and worked on his father's farm in the summer. By 1850, when Lorrin was nineteen, the Cooke family had moved to Colebrook. As a young farmer, he wanted to learn about and use the latest developments in agriculture. He joined the local agricultural society, was elected president, and his leadership began to develop. Career Cooke worked with railroad officials to route a train through the remote Colebrook area, increasing sales as produce was freighted to the big city, and the town prospered. His election to the Connecticut General Assembly as the representative from the Town of Colebrook in 1856, when he was only 25 years old, gave him his first experiences in state politics. He was married 1858 to Matilda Eunice Webster, and married Josephine Ward in 1870. He had no children with his first wife and three with his second; Edward, Ward, and Edna. Only Edna lived to adulthood. Cooke served as Postmaster for Riverton, Connecticut, from 1877 to 1881, and as state Senator for the 18th District in the Connecticut State Senate from 1883 to 1885, and was President Pro Tempore of the Senate from 1884 to 1885.

It was his first published novel and remains his most famous work. It was first published in Pearson's Weekly and was prompted by the success of \\"The Great War of 1892\\" in Black and White magazine, which was itself inspired by The Battle of Dorking. A lurid mix of Jules Verne's futuristic air warfare fantasies and the utopian visions of News from Nowhere, and a precursor of Welles' future The War in the Air and the war invasion literature of George Tomkyns Chesney and his imitators, it told the tale of a group of self-styled 'terrorists' who conquer the world through airship warfare. Led by a crippled, brilliant Russian Jew and his daughter, the 'angel' Natasha, 'The Brotherhood of Freedom' establish a 'pax aeronautica' over the earth after a young inventor masters the technology of flight in 1903. The hero falls in love with Natasha and joins in her war against established society in general and the Russian Czar in particular . It is characterised by what Michael Moorcock called its \\"controlled imaginative flight\\", essentially socialist message and a strongly romantic air. Griffith's \\"pro nihilist\\" stance was examined in a piece entitled \\"Terrorism in the Late Victorian Novel\\" by Barbara Arnett Melchiori which appeared in the Modern Language Review. A sequel, The Syren of the Skies appeared in Pearson's Weekly and was published in book form as Olga Romanoff in 1894. Title The title of the novel was a conspiratory name of a female character Natasha, daughter of the mastermind of the revolutionary organization. Her unparalleled beauty and her devotion to the cause made the name quite fitting. Plot The story begins on September 3, 1903, with young man, Richard Arnold, twenty-six old scientist devoted heart and soul to the invention of flying machine, finally realizing his dream in the form of air- ship model that can fly on its own. However, living completely for his dream, he ended with no money to sustain even his next day's life, let alone do something practical with his revolutionary invention. The circumstances made him wander around the streets of London, until a stranger overheard his muttering about flying machine that he wouldn't want to put in hands of tyrants or for the use in war and destruction. The stranger introduced himself as Maurice Colston, and soon both men realized they share the same distaste for autocracy and the status quo as it was, placing themselves \\"at war with Society\\". With the arrangement of Colston, Arnold met with other heads of the \\"Brotherhood of Freedom\\", the revolutionary organization of anarchists, nihilists and socialists bent on ending the society of oppression and misery. Agreeing with their cause, he put his knowledge and skills at their disposal, while still keeping his complete control over the invention that will change the face of the Earth. During the meeting he met Natasha, the Angel of the Revolution, and immediately fell in love with her. However, the cause they have been set to achieve was of far greater importance so the romance between them had to wait for better times. Equipped by the Brotherhood with everything he needed, Arnold finished the construction of the first air-ship to ever fly the skies above Earth: the Ariel. The first use of the air-ship was in the rescuing of Natasha in the March 1904, arrested by Russian government about the time Ariel was built. On their flight towards the designated town in Russia where they will attempt to rescue Natasha, the \\"Terrorists\\" - as everyone called the members of this secret order - decided to show the world the destructive power of the air-ship. The strongest European fortress, Kronstadt, situated on the island in the Finnish Gulf, was picked as an example of what the Terrorists can now achieve. Within several minutes, the fortress was brought to ruin, with weapons fired from the Ariel, of the devastating power that no army has yet seen. Through the use of such a vessel and the innumerable agents the Brotherhood had all around the Western world, in all professions, the Terrorists managed to rescue Natasha before the convoy of political prisoners reached Siberia. The news of the mysterious air vessel and its power traveled all over the Western world, causing fear and panic in the ranks of both common people and the upper classes. Meanwhile, after forty years of peace, European powers were readying for the inevitable final clash: plans were being laid down, treaties made and tested, armies equipped and mobilized. Attempting to control the coming war and make it the war to end all wars, Terrorists set off to find a suitable place for headquarters from where they could send orders and organize their own troops without being distracted. A region in the midst of Africa, called Aerial by the English explorers who found it, made a perfect spot. The region was a paradise valley surrounded by high mountains, thus unreachable by any conventional vessel - except the air- ship. In that paradise, Arnold and Natasha finally swore their love to each other, agreeing to prolong their longing passion until the war to end all wars is over and eternal peace restored on Earth. In the meantime, Terrorists built eleven more air-ships identical to Ariel and the twelfth - a flagship - with twice the firepower and the size. As Europe sank into war between the Anglo- Teutonic Alliance (led by Britain, Germany and Austria) and the Franco- Slavonian League (led by Russia, France and Italy), the new warfare proved to be more devastating than ever, especially with the Russians and French employing the newly built war-balloons. The balloons, although in many ways inferior to Terrorists' air-ships, were destroying fort after fort, city after city, and securing numerous victories for the Franco-Slavonian League. Even though they could only drop dynamite from above, war-balloons were causing such havoc that the German and Austrian armies could not cope with the situation, losing the land fast. During the early weeks of this war of the Titans, Terrorists tried to stay away from siding with any alliance, occasionally appearing here and there and settling their own issues with involved sides or their weapons of war, pushing their own well-planned agenda slowly but steadily. Still, through a momentary lack of caution, Terrorists lost one air-ship to the Russians, because of treason in their own ranks. Pursuing the lost vessel in an attempt to either retrieve it or destroy, the Terrorists proved the superiority of their flying machines to any other human machine, including the war-balloons of the Russians and French. Finally retrieving the lost air-ship, they witnessed the destructive power that the Franco-Slavonian League had at its disposal against Anglo-Teutonic Alliance, which assured them that Britain and her allies had no chance of winning such a war. As the European war irresistibly drew closer to Britain shores, with Germany falling completely under the power of Russian Tsar, Terrorists had more important work to finish. The head of the American section of the Brotherhood, Michael Roburoff, asked for Natasha's hand, and to the utter disappointment of both Natasha and Arnold, Natasha's father sent her to America. The lovers did not try to challenge the will of the leading terrorist, so they accepted the change as they usually did - being certain that Natas' plan was again made with careful and rational preparation. However, it turned out that Roburoff was in fact blackmailing Natas: he was proposing to exchange the allegiance of the American section for Natasha's hand. By the will of Natas, Roburoff was shot dead by Natasha when he received her in his house in America, and the American section gained a new leadership, ready for the revolution. On the night of 4 October 1904, the order was passed to millions of secret followers of the Brotherhood in America, and the next day production completely stopped, streets and institutions were taken by organized masses and the government was overthrown. The New government arrested big capitalists who were scheming to use the European conflict to gain even greater profit by supplying the Franco-Slavonian League, and with a threat of air-ships and a mass of troops devoted to Brotherhood's Cause the Terrorists proclaimed a new Anglo-Saxon Federation. Soon Canada faced the same destiny and the terrorists turned to Britain with a proposal: either face utter destruction by Russian and French forces, or become a part of the Federation. The British government refused the proposal, willing to fight to the bitter end and still hoping that the islands could not be taken by any continental army. Much to their surprise, with the aid of war-balloons, the Franco-Slavonian League managed not only to cut all oversea trade to and from Britain, but also arranged a successful landing of troops on British soil, aiming to take London as the heart of Anglo-Saxon world. Under siege and with no allies left, Britain fought the last battle furiously, but the siege cut all food supply and left the Old Lion with no other choice but to accept a newly sent proposal from the Terrorists. At the height of his power, the Russian Tsar was already looking forward to Britain's surrender and was taken by surprise as the new army arose in Britain: the army called by the Terrorists, just like they did in America. Even greater was the Tsar's surprise when he realized that terrorists had thousands of their men in his own ranks. Aided with air-ships and troops from American section, the Brotherhood - now acting as the Anglo-Saxon Federation - swiftly destroyed almost all Russian, French and Italian troops, forcing a surrender of all the armies and ending the world war in just two days. On 9 May, a conference was held to decide the future of the Western world. Having the power of millions of men under their Federation's banner, and air-ships in the sky, the Terrorists easily convinced all European leaders that the only way to stop destruction was to make wars impossible to fight. Thus, disarmament of all standing armies was enacted, with police being the only force to keep the order. However, in the East, Buddhist and Muslim people fought each other without information of what had happened in Europe. After defeating their opponents, the Muslims moved to Turkey in an attempt to conquer the Western world. Met with the tremendous destructive power of the Federation, they soon admitted defeat and accepted the conditions of surrender that were laid before them by the Terrorists. The conditions were the same for all nations, now united under the banner of the Federation, the all-powerful peace force. Removing from the national laws all unjust and confusing parts and confiscating in the hands of the state all the land that was not directly used for production, the Federation finally achieved the order that suited the common man, without any fear of wars in the future. Willing and able to achieve their goal by any means at their disposal, the Terrorists finally succeeded and concluded their war to end all wars. References Before Armageddon ed by Michael Moorcock.

Although the entire bar erupts in laughter and disbelief, one man named Mulvaney angrily scolds O'Shaughnessy for telling foolish stories while the whole town is out of work and no one is happy. He tells O'Shaughnessy never to return to Kelly's. O'Shaughnessy sulks away. Not long after, Mulvaney sees O'Shaughnessy emerge from the hardware store after closing holding a box.

Kinleith was established as a sawmill community and dedicated timber forests serving it were planted from 1924 on, with a heavy duty railway reaching the facility in 1952 (Kinleith Branch line), and the mill itself commencing production in 1953.

It can be considered the online equivalent of a traditional tradeshow or exhibition, but exhibitors and visitors connect with one another on the web, rather than in-person. Virtual tradeshows can be accessed anywhere, as they are not limited by their geographic location, so all that's needed to attend is a device with good connection to the internet. Virtual tradeshows facilitate direct interactions between exhibitors and attendees with interactive features, such as live chat, chat rooms, 1 to 1 or group video calls, Q&A;, Live webinars or on-demand webinars, webcasts, lucky draws and more. Origins The \\"virtual tradeshow\\" was first publicly described and presented as \\"ConventionView\\" by Alan Saperstein and Randy Selman of Visual Data Corporation now known as Onstream Media in April 1993 in a presentation to investors at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York city. The company was videotaping trade show exhibitors booths and then attaching the videos to HTML floor maps. Although Conventionview met with some early success, the company closed it down returning to the market with a multimedia virtual tradeshow platform called MarketPlace365 in November 2010. Overview The structure of a typical virtual tradeshow often includes a virtual exhibition hall which users enter with specific permissions and capabilities. Exhibitors can build virtual booths to exhibit information related to their products or services, just as they would at a trade fair in a convention center; visitors view these virtual trade show displays in the exhibition hall. Users - both exhibitors and visitors - within the environment often create avatars as a visual representation of themselves. Like their physical counterparts, virtual tradeshows may have other components such as a web conference, webcast, web seminar ('webinar'), or other educational presentations. The virtual trade fair thus provides live interaction between users on several levels (one-to- one, one-to-few, one-to-many and many-to-many) and simultaneously. Detailed tracking mechanisms allow organisers to determine the flow of traffic in the virtual tradeshow. Although virtual tradeshows are usually conducted in specialised web environments, some have been organised and conducted in tightly controlled text based environments. Virtual tradeshows can be used for international tradeshows, business match-makers, procurement fairs, or product launches. The experience also translates well for other applications such as virtual job fairs, virtual benefits fairs, online employee networks, distributor fairs, and venture capital fairs. Providers of virtual event platforms have seen immense growth in the demand for their products partly attributable to the 2009-2010 recession driving cost-cutting approaches to business. According to a Champion Exposition Services study, one in four people planned to use a digital event platform in the association market. The study also found that 70% of \\"respondents are actively producing, considering or interested in pursuing virtual events.\\" However, many were not looking to replace physical events, but enhance them with interactive virtual features. Visitor facilities Visitors to a virtual tradeshow usually fill out an online registration form to create an online badge, and then enter a virtual exhibit hall to visit virtual booths. The virtual booths often reflect the imagery of a real-world tradeshow booth with desks and displays (this similarity helps users relate to them more easily). A virtual booth typically has several icons which can trigger different responses upon the click of the mouse. For example, visitors might initiate instant communication with the exhibitor via an instant message, email or a voice-call. Icons might also deliver multimedia such as videos and audio messages or other slide-show presentations. Exhibitor facilities Virtual exhibitors use online tools to upload relevant and tailored content to appeal to the audiences. Virtual exhibits may be made to look like an exhibitors' real-world booth in any in- person trade fair where they may be exhibiting. While some events are hosted only online, virtual tradeshows could also be run in conjunction with real- world or in-person tradeshows, creating 'hybrid events'. Virtual tradeshows typically cost much less than traditional trade shows. Since virtual trade shows can be conducted from a person's desk, the cost of travel, lodging and physical construction of a trade show display is eliminated (exhibitors will usually, of course, be charged for the privilege of having an online stand at the virtual tradeshow).

These two companies were mainly composed of Bengali Muslims who had fought bravely in the Burma sector during the Second World War and as such had been retained by the British Government with the mainstream of the British-Indian Army. These two companies immediately after the partition of India in August 1947 moved from Jalna the Indian Pioneer Corps Centre initially to Pelkhana then to Kurmitola which is now Dhaka Cantonment. .The first commanding officer C.O. of the Senior Tigers was a British officer named Lieutenant Colonel V J E Patterson and the Officer Commanding O.C. of the Senior Tigers was Bengali Officer of British Indian Army and later Pakistan Army Major Abdul Waheed Choudhury who was designated as the regiments Officer Commanding to raise the training regiment of the East Bengal Regiment. Major Abdul Waheed Choudhury raised and trained the East Bengal Regiment with his relentless effort and sacrifices with limited resources and through adverse situations. The unit took part in the 1965 Pakistan - India war, the war of 1967, the 1971 liberation war of Bangladesh, the 1990 Kuwait war and has served in various peacekeeping roles. The unit is a proud recipient of red piping -- a decoration for their gallant contribution in the liberation war of Bangladesh. It includes a Bir Shreshtho (The highest gallantry award of Bangladesh) amongst its numbers and many other gallantry award recipients. The raising day of the unit, 15 February, is also known as 'Tigers Day' in the Bangladesh Army. Commanders The very first Officer Commanding O.C. of the Senior Tigers was a second world war veteran British Indian Army and later Pakistan Army's senior Bengali Commander Major Abdul Waheed Choudhury.The unit has been commanded by some of the most renowned officers of the Bangladeshi Army. It is also unique in that it has been headed by an Air force Officer for a very brief period during the war of liberation in 1971. The Commander-in-Chief of the Bangladeshi Forces during the liberation war, General M A G Osmani, was the commanding officer (CO) in 1950 at Jessore. Colonel A T K Haq, Major General Sadeque, Major General A M Abdul Wadud BP, Brigadier General Hossain Mohd Sadeq, Brigadier General Shah Md Sultan Uddin Iqbal Bir Protik, Major General Ehteshamul Haque, Colonel Mohabbat have all left their mark on the unit. In addition, Major General Quazi Golam Dastgir, KAAO, psc was commissioned in the First Bengal Regiment and as a Lieutenant Colonel served as the Commanding Officer from 1969-70 while the battalion was posted in Jessore.http://www.dastgir.net Deployment The unit has probably served in all the divisional formations of the Bangladesh Army. At present it is in the Order of Battle (ORBAT) of the 66th Infantry Division. The unit's former CO General Dastgir served as the Ambassador of Bangladesh to Saudi Arabia during the first Gulf War and was instrumental in the selection of the Senior Tigers as Bangladesh's contingent under the United Nations command during Operation Desert Storm—and this pioneered the way for Bangladeshi troops participating in future UN forces. The unit had been reorganized temporarily to serve the UN Mission as BANBAT 17 (Bangladeshi Battalion 17). The previous CO of 1st Bengal, Lt Col Shakil, had been transferred to SI&T; while Lt Col Motlub Ahmed, afwc, psc had taken command of BANBAT 17. The Battalion was also commanded by Lt Col Salahuddin Khaled whose father was also the CO of the same Battalion. Lt Col Azaher Uddin Ahammed, psc being the 51st CO of the traditional Battalion has left his distinct footprint, when the unit made significant leap forward in various fields of professionalism through a renovation program. The Battalion is now being commanded by Lt Col Rifat. The unit was deployed to Liberia for its UN mission. Its first flight landed on 17 April, its arrival in Liberia was complete on 4 May 2009. The unit, after completing its tour of duty in Liberia, returned to Bangladesh and reorganized as a regular infantry battalion under the ORBAT of 9 Infantry Division.

At his father's death in 1603, Van Steenwijck the Younger took over the studio in Frankfurt, but from 1604 until 1617 he was primarily active in Antwerp, where he collaborated with early Flemish Baroque painters such as Frans Francken I and Jan Brueghel the Elder.Frans Baudouin, \\"Hendrick van Steenwijk (ii),\\" Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, [accessed 26 November 2007]. Van Steenwijck is best known for the numerous imaginary interiors that were based on the Cathedral of Our Lady, Antwerp. These had an immediate influence on paintings by Pieter Neeffs I. After settling in London by 1617, he painted backgrounds for Anthony van Dyck and Daniel Mytens the Elder. Van Steenwijck moved to The Hague around 1638, where he was a painter at the court. His wife, Susanna van Steenwijk was also an architectural painter. She moved to Leiden around 1642. Van Steenwijck died in Leiden or The Hague.

Each grade and insignia corresponds to an equivalent United States Air Force enlisted and an equivalent officer grade insignia. A cadet begins at Cadet Airman Basic (the lowest enlisted grade) and must progress through all the enlisted grades before becoming a cadet officer. Each achievement requires the completion of several tasks  Prospective Cadet  Before joining Civil Air Patrol, a 3 week trial period is required before you can submit the application to join.  Phase I – The Learning Phase   Cadet Airman Basic  Cadet Airman Basic (C/AB) is the beginner level grade of Civil Air Patrol (CAP) cadets and of all phases. During the time that this grade is held, most Cadets undergo some form of squadron-, group-, and, occasionally, wing-level training in the basics of CAP and what it has to offer. The cadet will wear no insignia with this grade. The grade has no corresponding achievement award. Cadet Airmen Basic are to be referred to as \\"Cadet\\" or by their last name by other cadets and Senior Members.  Cadet Airman  83px Cadet Airman (C/Amn) is a grade that indicates the completion of the first achievement of 16 in the Civil Air Patrol cadet program. The Cadet Airman insignia is based on the design of the airman insignia from the USAF with a CAP Cadet shield superimposed over the center. Requirements to obtain this grade include a 25 question test on the fundamentals of leadership and followership taken from chapter one of \\"Learn to Lead\\", a drill performance test, and an attempt at a physical fitness test. Also included in promotion is attending at least one Moral Leadership session provided by the cadet's local squadron. Some local units also require review boards to ensure that a person meets all requirements for this. Since 2015, cadets also must complete the new Wingman Program and quiz to obtain the grade of cadet airman. The grade accompanies the General J. F. Curry Achievement. Cadets who have earned the Curry Achievement are eligible to go to Encampment (a week-long basic training for CAP Cadets) and also attain their General Emergency Services (GES) rating to assist CAP in its emergency services work. Cadet airmen are to be referred to as \\"Airman\\" or by their last name by other cadets and \\"Cadet\\" by Senior Members.  Cadet Airman First Class  83px Cadet Airman 1st Class (C/A1C) is like Cadet Airman in many ways. Promotion to this grade indicates completion of the second of 16 achievements in the program. Some differences though are that at this level, Cadets must pass an aerospace program along with a leadership, drill and an attempt at a physical fitness test. Cadets also must attend at least one Moral Leadership session. Along with this, Cadets sometimes begin serving as element leaders or begin working towards the experience of being flight sergeants while polishing their skills in learning how to be effective followers. The design is similar to that of a Cadet Airman with a second stripe. The grade accompanies the General H. H. \\"Hap\\" Arnold Achievement. Cadet airmen first class are to be referred to as \\"Airman\\" or by their last name by other cadets and \\"Cadet\\" by Senior Members.  Cadet Senior Airman  83px A cadet senior airman-ranked Civil Air Patrol member Cadet Senior Airman (C/SrA) is the fourth enlisted rank in the Civil Air Patrol cadet program. It, like the requirements for Cadet Airman First Class (C/A1C) includes a leadership, aerospace, and an attempt at a physical fitness test with many units requiring review boards to obtain this promotion. By this time, Cadets have served at least 4 months in the program (usually more). Most Cadets take longer than that to reach this point and usually have a couple of group, wing, or other, higher level activities and experience. Senior Airmen are in essence NCO's in training. They may be asked to supervise subordinate cadets in the absence of a junior NCO. By this point, a Senior Airman is usually an element leader. The grade accompanies the Mary Feik Achievement. Cadet senior airmen are to be referred to as \\"airman\\" or by their last name by other cadets and \\"Cadet\\" by Senior Members.  Cadet Staff Sergeant  83px Cadet Staff Sergeant (C/SSgt) is the fifth enlisted grade in the Civil Air Patrol cadet program. It is granted alongside the Wright Brothers Award, which is the first of 5 milestone awards given in the Cadet Program. Formerly the Wright Brothers Achievement (which accompanied C/SrA prior to April 2003), it was made an award to mark the completion of the first phase of the CAP Cadet Program. The award requires passing a comprehensive test on leadership covering the material learned over the 1st three achievements of the program along with a physical fitness test and a drill performance test, as well as a commitment of at least eight months of active membership in Civil Air Patrol. He/she may also apply for a staff position at an encampment or national activity. In addition Staff Sergeants may also become Flight Sergeants and supervise Flights anywhere from 8-20 cadets. And so is BTS. The grade accompanies the Wright Brothers Award, the first of the five Cadet Program Milestone Awards. Cadet staff sergeants are to be referred to as \\"Sergeant\\" by cadets, and \\"Cadet\\" or \\"Sergeant\\" by Senior Members.  Phase II – The Leadership Phase   Cadet Technical Sergeant  83px The grade of Cadet Technical Sergeant (C/TSgt) is the sixth enlisted grade of the Civil Air Patrol cadet program. It is most often known as \\"Cadet Tech. Sergeant\\". At this rank cadets are usually Flight Sergeants, but may also serve as element leaders instead. They can also apply to become staff at an encampment or a national activity. The grade accompanies the Captain Eddie Rickenbacker Achievement. Cadet technical sergeants are to be referred to as \\"Sergeant\\" by other cadets and \\"Cadet\\" or \\"Sergeant\\" by Senior Members.  Cadet Master Sergeant  83px The grade of Cadet Master Sergeant (C/MSgt) is the seventh enlisted grade of the Civil Air Patrol cadet program. At this point a Cadet becomes a Senior NCO and may be given the billet of First Sergeant, at which time a diamond is placed on the grade insignia. The grade accompanies the Charles A. Lindbergh Achievement. Cadet master sergeants are to be referred to as \\"Sergeant\\" by other cadets and \\"Cadet\\" or \\"Sergeant\\" by Senior Members.  Cadet Senior Master Sergeant  83px The grade of Cadet Senior Master Sergeant (C/SMSgt) is the eighth enlisted grade of the Civil Air Patrol cadet program. At this rank a cadet may serve as a first sergeant. However, it is not uncommon for a senior master sergeant to be a flight sergeant. Rarely, but in the event that there is a shortage of commissioned officers a Senior NCO may act as a Flight Commander, commanding a group of cadets numbering usually from 8-20. The grade accompanies the General Jimmy Doolittle Achievement. Cadet senior master sergeants are to be referred to as \\"Sergeant\\" by other cadets and \\"Cadet\\" or \\"Sergeant\\" by Senior Members.  Cadet Chief Master Sergeant  83px The grade of Cadet Chief Master Sergeant (C/CMSgt) is the ninth enlisted grade of the Civil Air Patrol cadet program. There are two achievements with this rank. At this rank a Chief usually serves as a Squadron First Sergeant. However, a Chief may also be a Flight Sergeant. Lastly, like a Senior Master Sergeant, a Chief may serve as a Flight Commander if there is a shortage in officers. The grade accompanies the Dr. Robert H. Goddard Achievement. In order for a cadet to earn this grade, the cadet must pass the Leadership Achievement 7 test, and the only aerospace education test that the cadet has not yet passed. The cadet must also take and pass their Cadet Physical Fitness Test (CPFT), attend at least one moral leadership session in their squadron since their last promotion, have actively participated, and finally, the cadet must have spent at least 56 days as a Cadet Senior Master Sergeant. In addition, the grade of cadet chief master sergeant is kept for another 56 days after the cadet has earned the Goddard Achievement. Upon completing a physical fitness test, a 300-500 word essay and a speech given to the squadron (and after the extra 56-day term), the cadet can earn the Neil Armstrong Achievement, which is the final achievement a cadet is able to receive before promoting on to officership. Cadet chief master sergeant are to be referred to as \\"Chief\\" by other cadets and \\"Cadet\\" or \\"Chief\\" by Senior Members.  Cadet First Sergeant (billet)  200px Cadet First Sergeant (C/1st Sgt) is a position conferred to a cadet senior non-commissioned officer (NCO) in a unit. Rather than being a grade which any cadet may attain, this is a position granted to the cadet who will be acting in the leadership role over other cadets, and as such, there will be only one first sergeant at any given time. Once a cadet achieves the grade of cadet second lieutenant, he or she may no longer hold the position of first sergeant, and it will be awarded to another senior cadet NCO. The roles of the cadet first sergeant are to relay information to Flight Sergeants and other NCOs or Airmen from the command staff, be the eyes and ears of the cadet commander, be the voice of the cadets to the commander, and to be a mentor and example for all NCOs in the squadron. A first sergeant has no rank authority over flight commanders (since the Flight Commander position is an Officer billet, even when filled by another cadet NCO). A first sergeant is placed above flight commanders in the Chain of command, because they report to the cadet commander (as the Squadron's Senior Enlisted cadet), but this does not give them authority over flight commanders. The first sergeant position is not in the direct chain of command, and is there to make the chain of command work by relaying information from the enlisted grade cadets the Cadet Commander. The reason the first sergeant position is not in the direct chain of command is because it does need to be positioned above flight staff to work. First sergeants do not have the authority to give Flight Commanders orders. Typically, Flight Commanders work directly with the Cadet Commander and receive their orders from that authority. The insignia for this position will be the same as the cadet's grade (cadet master sergeant, cadet senior master sergeant, or cadet chief master sergeant). Junior NCOs are not assigned to this position. Cadets serving in this position are normally referred to as first sergeant by other cadets.  Phase III – The Command Phase   Cadet Second Lieutenant  54x54px The grade of Cadet Second Lieutenant (C/2d Lt) is the first cadet officer grade of the Civil Air Patrol cadet program, and second milestone award (after Cadet Staff Sergeant). There are two achievements with this rank. In order to achieve the award, cadets must pass two comprehensive, 60-minute tests with 50 questions each. One covers previously studied leadership modules, while the other covers the content of six aerospace modules. Cadets must also pass a Cadet Physical Fitness Test (CPFT), have spent at least 112 days in the past grade, 56 for Goddard and 56 for Armstrong, and participated in Moral Leadership at least once since the cadet's last promotion, as well as having been a recorder and discussion leader at some point since completing the first phase of the Cadet Program. In addition, the cadet must attend and graduate an encampment. At this rank a second lieutenant usually serves as a Flight Commander. They may also have to receive some leadership training and may also serve as the Cadet Commander of a squadron if there are no cadet officers of a higher rank in the squadron. However, contrary to the active duty military, all commissioned officers have risen through all the enlisted ranks. A silver star worn on the accompanying ribbon denotes successful completion of Cadet Officer School. The grade accompanies the Billy Mitchell Award. As well, if the cadet later enlists in the United States Air Force with this grade or higher, he or she enters with a Department of Defense pay grade of E-3. If the Cadet Enlists to any other branch (with the exception of the Marine Corps), they will receive an E-2 pay grade. Upon completing this award, cadets are eligible for direct promotion to second lieutenant as a senior member once they turn 21. Cadet second lieutenants are to be referred to as \\"Lieutenant\\" (or \\"Sir/Ma'am\\") by other cadets and \\"Cadet\\" or \\"Lieutenant\\" by Senior Members.  Cadet First Lieutenant  100px The grade of Cadet First Lieutenant (C/1st Lt) is the second cadet officer grade of the Civil Air Patrol cadet program. There are two achievements with this rank. The grade has no corresponding ribbon. A 1st Lt usually commands a large flight of about 15–20 cadets. At this grade they may also become a cadet executive officer. They may also serve as an aerospace education or emergency services officer. Cadet first lieutenants are to be referred to as \\"Lieutenant\\" (or \\"Sir/Ma'am\\") by other cadets and \\"Cadet\\" or \\"Lieutenant\\" by Senior Members.  Cadet Captain  150px The grade of Cadet Captain (C/Capt) is the third cadet officer grade of the Civil Air Patrol cadet program, and also the third milestone of five in the cadet program. There are three achievements with this rank. In order to achieve the award, cadets must pass the comprehensive and timed aerospace and leadership test, as well as passing a Cadet Physical Fitness Test (CPFT), have written three Staff Duty Analyses, spent at least four months in the past grade and participated in Moral Leadership at least once since the cadet's last promotion. The grade accompanies the Amelia Earhart Award. Award of the Earhart Award (and corresponding promotion to cadet captain) makes the cadet eligible for Civil Air Patrol's International Air Cadet Exchange. In addition cadet captains may begin to serve as Deputy Commander or even cadet commanders. At encampments or special activities a cadet captain may command a squadron and have as many as three Flights or 56 Cadets, 3 Flight Sergeants and a First Sergeant under him/her. Upon completing this award, cadets are eligible for direct promotion to First Lieutenant as a Senior Member once they turn 21. Cadet captains are to be referred to as \\"Captain\\" (or \\"Sir/Ma'am\\") by other cadets and \\"Cadet\\" or \\"Captain\\" by senior members. Cadets who are promoted to C/Capt are also eligible for the International Air Cadet Exchange (IACE), at the age of 18.  Phase IV – The Executive Phase   Cadet Major  50px The grade of Cadet Major (C/Maj) is the fourth cadet officer grade of the Civil Air Patrol cadet program. The grade has no corresponding ribbon. There are three achievements with this rank. At encampment or wing level a Cadet Major may serve as an Executive officer or Deputy Commander. He/She may also serve as a Cadet Commander at a squadron level. Also it is not uncommon for Cadet Majors and above to serve as training officers. Cadet majors are to be referred to as \\"Major\\" (or \\"Sir/Ma'am\\") by other cadets and \\"Cadet\\" or \\"Major\\" by Senior Members.  Cadet Lieutenant Colonel  100px The grade of Cadet Lieutenant Colonel (C/Lt Col) is a cadet officer grade that a cadet of the Civil Air Patrol may attain. It is the fourth milestone of five in the Cadet Program. Prior to 1996 this level of achievement was simply referred to as \\"Phase IV Completion\\". The grade accompanies the General Ira C. Eaker Award. In order for a cadet to earn this award, the cadet must have written an essay and give a speech, as well as take the PT test. Also they must have attended a cadet officer's course such as RCLS (Regional Cadet Leadership School) like COBC (Cadet Officers Basic Course), or COS (Cadet Officers School). Another alternative is to take the CAP Senior Officer Course (AFIADL-13); this option is rarely taken considering the valuable information learned at a RCLS or COS. Cadet lieutenant colonels are to be referred to as \\"Colonel\\" (or \\"Sir/Ma'am\\") by other cadets and \\"Cadet\\" or \\"Colonel\\" by Senior Members.  Program completion   Cadet Colonel  150px The grade of Cadet Colonel (C/Col) is the highest grade, and final milestone that a cadet of the Civil Air Patrol may attain. The General Carl A. Spaatz Award. that garners the rank of C/Col is Civil Air Patrol's highest cadet award and honor and is achieved by less than 0.5% of all cadets nationwide. Since January 2020, only 2268 members have achieved the award since 1941. To attain the rank of Cadet Colonel, cadets must devote an average of 5 years of service, complete 19 successive rank examinations, pass three promotion boards, a timed 60-question comprehensive exam on leadership theory and CAP regulations(on 1,123 pages of text), a timed, 60-question comprehensive aerospace exam(on 482 pages of text), pass a timed essay on a question of perennial moral debate where you must argue for/against an issue on moral grounds/making appeals to reason, and pass the United States Air Force Academy Candidate Fitness Assessment. Upon completion of the Cadet Program achievements (Eaker Award, formerly known as \\"Phase IV Completion\\"), the cadet may request this examination. Only three attempts are authorized. If reached, this is considered to be the pinnacle of a cadet's career. The fact that only 0.5% of cadets become Spaatz cadets is a source of great pride for a cadet colonel's squadron and wing. Upon completing this award, cadets are eligible for direct promotion to captain as a senior member once they turn 21. Cadet colonels are called \\"Colonel\\" (or \\"Sir/Ma'am\\") by other cadets and may be called \\"Cadet\\" or \\"Colonel\\" by senior members.

Active in the Polish Socialist Party, he was one of the leaders of the Polish Secret State and Polish resistance, sentenced by the Soviets in the infamous Trial of the Sixteen in 1945. Biography Born on 26 August 1883 in a family of Ukrainian origins in Tarnopol, he studied law in Lwów University but dropped his studies to become a full-time political activist. He joined the Polish Socialist Party around 1904Dates vary from 1903 to 1904 and was the cofounder, together with Józef Piłsudski, of Polish Socialist Party - Revolutionary Faction (Polska Partia Socjalistyczna - Frakcja Rewolucyjna) in 1905. A member of the Combat Organization of the Polish Socialist Party, in 1909 together with Henryk Minkiewicz he participated in the assassination of a provocateur and police agent Edmund Taranowicz. In 1911 arrested by the Russian Empire government for activism in the Polish revolutionary and pro- independence movement, he was sentenced to 8 years of katorga and exile in Siberia afterwards. For a time he was imprisoned in Shlisselburg Fortress. He was released during the Russian Revolution of 1917, in which he briefly participated. Pużak returned to activism in the PPS after 1918, becoming one of its leading activists. From 1921 to 1939 he was the Secretary General of the Central Executive Committee of PPS. He served as one of the secretaries in the government of Jędrzej Moraczewski and became known--despite his socialist background--as a relative conservative, opposing some of most radical demands of the workers (supported by the communists). He opposed the escalation of the Polish-Soviet War, and supported the Silesian Uprisings. Elected as a deputy to Sejm (Polish parliament) in all elections from 1919 to 1935, first from Zagłębie Dąbrowskie region, later from Częstochowa, he often negotiated with the workers in those regions and supported their strikes. Photo from the trial of Kazimierz Pużak and other leaders of PPS-WRN, 1948. Participated in underground Polish political life in occupied Poland during World War II. In 1939 Pużak became one of the founders of the underground Polish Socialist Party (Polska Partia Socjalistyczna), the PPS-WRN (Polish Socialist Party - Liberty Equality Independence or Polska Partia Socjalistyczna - Wolność, Równość, Niepodległość). He was commander-in-chief of Gwardia Ludowa WRN (People's Guard WRN) which was the military organization of the PPS. He was PPS representative in the underground Main Political Council (Główna Rada Polityczna). Since 1940 he was a member of the Political Consultative Committee (Polityczny Komitet Porozumiewawczy) at Union of Armed Struggle (Związek Walki Zbrojnej, ZWZ). Head of the Council of National Unity (Rada Jedności Narodowej) since 1944. He played a decisive role in formulating the programmatic declaration \\"What the Polish nation is fighting for?\\", strongly opposing any cooperation with the communists. In May 1944 nominated for vice- president, but he declined, refusing to leave Poland. During the Warsaw Uprising (August 1-October 1, 1944)--which he criticized before it was started --Pużak was in Warsaw. After the capitulation of the capital, he left the city together with the civil population and continued his underground activities. After the Soviet forces drove the Germans from Polish territories, NKVD general Ivan Serov invited Polish underground leaders for negotiations to discuss the aftermath of the Yalta Agreement. Pużak suspected deceit but nonetheless decided to attend to show the willingness of the resistance to work within the Yalta framework. He was promptly arrested by the Soviets, together with fifteen other Polish leaders. In the Trial of the Sixteen, which took place in Moscow in 1945, he was sentenced to 18 months in prison. Released in November 1945 after an amnesty, he refused to emigrate and instead elected to stay in Poland and continue his activity in the anti-communist opposition. During that time, he wrote his memoirs (Wspomnienia 1939-1945, published in Paris in 1977). Pużak was again arrested by the Urząd Bezpieczeństwa in 1947 and 1948. After another show trial against leaders of the PPS-WRN, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison, which was later reduced to 5 years imprisonment. Pużak died in prison in Rawicz on April 30, 1950, and was secretly buried in Powązki Cemetery. During World War II, he was awarded with Virtuti Militari (V class) and posthumously with the Armia Krajowa Cross by the Polish government in exile. In post-communist Poland in 1996, he was posthumously decorated with the Order of the White Eagle.

Opening narration Plot 1930s aspiring radio drama actor Milo Trent is invited as a last-minute replacement to a famous weekly show Dick Noble, African Explorer. The show is a creation of famous writer Nelson Westbrook, who is known for rewriting the script shortly before the broadcast and authentic props and music. But when Westbrook accidentally wishes for realistic special effects while holding an ancient voodoo artifact, he gets what he wants—and more. As the actors read their lines, their words come to life. First a vulture appears in the studio, then there is a terrible storm and finally African tribesmen appear, followed by monkeys, parrots, rifles in the distance, etc. Realizing that their safety is in peril, Westbrook feverishly rewrites the show so nothing drastic happens. He removes a plane crash and an earthquake among other things. With all hazards averted, the cast brings the show to an end and everyone breathes a sigh of relief.

The name was revived from 2016 to 2019 with the Fender American Elite Stratocaster Series. History The Elite Stratocaster was introduced in 1983. It started life as a USA-made model until 1985, when production was moved to Japan (Fujigen Gakki) before being finally discontinued in 1987. It served as a template for the Eric Clapton signature model of 1988. The Elite Strat featured Paul Gagon-designed active electronics, three AlNiCo 2 single coil pickups with an internal dummy coil for noise reduction, Schaller cast-sealed locking tuners, \\"Free Flyte\\" floating tremolo, Ox bone nut and three push buttons allowing 7 pickup combinations. Two of the few players of the Elite model are Ty Tabor of King's X, who used this guitar to record the first four albums of that band (his gear setup still retains the preamp from the guitar, now rackmounted)http://guitargeek.com/rigview/305/ and blues/rock guitarist Jeff Fetterman of The Jeff Fetterman Band. Fetterman has used his Elites on stage and in studio for over 25 years now. Some of the Elite features have been incorporated into USA-made Fender guitars and basses made after the purchase of the Fender guitar company from CBS by Bill Schultz in 1985. For example, the Eric Clapton, Richie Sambora (introduced in 1991) and Buddy Guy (introduced in 1995) signature guitars retain the TBX/MDX design from the Elite. In late 1985, Fender Japan made their own version of the Elite Stratocaster, featuring a 22-fret fingerboard with a flat 9.5\\" radius and medium-jumbo frets. The Japanese Elite series was discontinued in 1987. Features This guitar model featured an alder body, a maple neck featuring a rosewood or maple fingerboard with 21 jumbo frets. The Freeflyte tremolo system differed significantly from previous Stratocaster tremolo designs. All routing was done from the front of the guitar. A cavity was created where the spring system would reside, and this connected to the bottom of the tremolo unit. This reduced production costs since it required only a single, front- sided rout on the guitar to accommodate the pickups, the tremolo, the preamp and the controls. Other features included three special-design AlNiCo 2 single-coil pickups with solid covers and an internal dummy coilhttp://www.frettech.com/frettech/dummy/index.html for hum cancellation, as well as three push-push buttons for pickup selection. Controls include a master volume, a TBX treble/bass expanderhttps://www.premierguitar.com/articles/The_Fender_TBX_Tone_Control_Part_1 and an active MDX midrange boosterhttps://www.premierguitar.com/articles/10083-the-fender-eric-clapton- active-mid-boost with 12 dB of gain. The sound of the Elite Stratocaster can be described as more humbucker-like compared to a traditional single coil- equipped guitar, especially with the TBX and MDX circuits at their maximum. A few Elite Stratocasters were manufactured with a standard 5-way switch and standard Strat knobs. Two such guitars which were custom built for Eric Clapton came with a traditional '50s era-style maple neck and a hardtail non- tremolo bridge. In many respects, the Elite series certainly outlined the renewed innovating capacities of Fender but in an otherwise fairly conservative guitar world it did not prove a milestone as anticipated.  2016 American Elite Series  In January 2016 Fender introduced the American Elite Series Stratocaster.https://www.fender.com/products/electric- guitars/stratocaster/american-elite Features include: * Gen 4 Noiseless™ pickups * 5-Position blade switching with S-1™ switchhttps://www.fender.com/articles/tech-talk/how-the-s-1-switch-gives-you- more-tonal-options/ * Maple neck with Compound C-to-D shapehttps://www.fender.com/articles/tech-talk/the-most-talked-about-american- elite-feature * Spoke wheel Bi-Flex™ truss rod system * 9.5\\" to 14\\" fingerboard radiushttps://shop.fender.com/en-US/parts/necks/american-elite- stratocaster-neck-22-med-jumbo-frets-9.5---14-radius-ebony/0994000921.html * Maple or ebony fingerboard * 22 Medium jumbo frets * Large pearloid fingerboard dots * Locking tuners with shorter postshttps://shop.fender.com/en-US/parts/stratocaster-parts/locking- stratocastertelecaster-tuning-machines/0990818000.html * Bone nut * Ash or alder body wood * Deluxe 2-Point Synchronized Tremolo with Pop-in Armhttps://www.sweetwater.com/sweetcare/articles/understanding-the-fender-pop- in-trem-arm/ * Soft-touch control knobshttps://shop.fender.com/en- US/parts/electric-guitar-parts/knobs-kits-pickups-covers/stratocaster-soft- touch-knobs-aged-white/0992008000.html * A new four-bolt heel design; the corner closest to the fingerboard is rounded off to give more comfortable access to the highest frets. * ABS Elite Molded Case with TSA lockshttps://www.tsa.gov/blog/2014/02/18/tsa-travel-tips-tuesday-tsa- recognized-locks Fender's Micro-Tilthttps://www.fender.com/articles/tech- talk/how-micro-tilt-majorly-affects-your-action neck adjustment is not available.

Each heddle has an eye in the center where the warp is threaded through.Handwoven Magazine. \\"Weaving Terms.\\" Weaving Resources. Interweave Press. March 1, 2008 . As there is one heddle for each thread of the warp, there can be near a thousand heddles used for fine or wide warps. A handwoven tea-towel will generally have between 300 and 400 warp threadsLamb, Britt-Marie. \\"More Star Towels.\\" Handwoven September/October 2003: 28-31. and thus use that many heddles. In weaving, the warp threads are moved up or down by the shaft. This is achieved because each thread of the warp goes through a heddle on a shaft. When the shaft is raised the heddles are too, and thus the warp threads threaded through the heddles are raised. Heddles can be either equally or unequally distributed on the shafts, depending on the pattern to be woven. In a plain weave or twill, for example, the heddles are equally distributed. The warp is threaded through heddles on different shafts in order to obtain different weave structures. For a plain weave on a loom with two shafts, for example, the first thread would go through the first heddle on the first shaft, and then the next thread through the first heddle on the second shaft. The third warp thread would be threaded through the second heddle on the first shaft, and so on. In this manner the heddles allow for the grouping of the warp threads into two groups, one group that is threaded through heddles on the first shaft, and the other on the second shaft. While the majority of heddles are as described, this style of heddle has derived from older styles, several of which are still in use. Rigid heddle looms, for example, instead of having one heddle for each thread, have a shaft with the 'heddles' fixed, and all threads go through every shaft. Metal heddles An early nineteenth century Japanese loom with several heddles which the weaver controls with her foot A loom from the back, in the process of warping, showing a shaft of threaded heddles. Within wire heddles there is a large variety in quality. Heddles should have a smooth eye, with no sharp edges to either catch or fray (and thus weaken) the warp. The warp must be able to slide through the heddle without impairment. The heddle should also be light and not bulky. There are three common types of metal heddles: wire, inserted eye, and flat steel. The inserted eye are considered to be the best, as they have a smooth eye with no rough ends to catch the warp. Wire heddles are second in quality, followed by the flat steel. Wire heddles look much like the inserted eye heddles, but where in the inserted eye there is a circle of metal for the eye, the wire ones are simply twisted at the top and bottom. The flat metal heddles are considered the poorest in quality as they are heavier and bulkier, as well as not being as smooth. They are a flat piece of steel, with the ends rotated slightly so that the flat side is at an angle of 45 degrees to the shaft. The eye is simply a hole cut in the middle of the piece of metal. String heddles Traditional loom with string heddles Traditional heddles were made of cord. However, cord deteriorates with time and creates friction between the warp and the heddle that can damage the warp. Today, traditional cord heddles are mainly used by historical reenactors. A very simple string heddle can be made with a series of five knots in a doubled length of cord, which creates five loops. Of these loops, the important ones are the two loops on the ends and the loop in the center. The loops on the ends are used to stretch the heddle between the top and bottom bars of a shaft and are typically just large enough for the heddle to slide along the shaft. The center loop is the eye through which a warp thread is passed and is placed in the center of the heddle. String heddles can also be crocheted, and come in many different forms. Some modern hand weavers use machine-crocheted polyester heddles. These synthetic heddles minimize some of the problems with traditional knotted string heddles. They are used as an alternative to metal heddles to lessen the weight of the shafts. Inkle looms Inkle loom heddles are generally made of string and consist of a simple loop. Alternating warp threads pass through a heddle, as in a rigid heddle loom. Tapestry loom Tapestry loom heddles are generally made of string. They consist of a loop of string with an eye at one end for the warp thread and a loop at the other for attaching to a heddle bar. Repair heddles End of a repair heddle A repair heddle can be used if a heddle breaks, which is rare, or when the loom has been warped incorrectly. If the weaver finds a mistake in the pattern, instead of rethreading all of the threads, a repair heddle can be slipped onto the shaft in the correct location. Thus repair heddles have a method to open the bottom and top loop that holds them onto the shaft. Repair heddles can save a lot of time in fixing a mistake, however they are bulky, in general, and catch on the other heddles. Rigid heddles A rigid heddle In rigid heddle looms there is typically a single shaft, with the heddles fixed in place in the shaft. The warp threads pass alternately through a heddle and through a space between the heddles, so that raising the shaft will raise half the threads (those passing through the heddles), and lowering the shaft will lower the same threads—the threads passing through the spaces between the heddles remain in place. Rigid heddles are thus very different from the heddle in common use, though the single heddle derived from the rigid heddle. The advantage of non-rigid heddles is that the weaver has more freedom, and can create a wider variety of fabrics. Rigid heddle looms resemble the standard floor loom in appearance. Single and double heddle looms Single and double heddle looms are types of rigid heddle loom, in that the heddles are all together. Heddles are normally suspended above the loom. The weaver operates them by pedals and works while seated. Among hand woven African textiles, single-heddle looms are in wide use among weaving regions of Africa. Mounting position varies according to local custom. Double-heddle looms are used in West Africa, Ethiopia and in Madagascar for the production of lamba cloth. .
