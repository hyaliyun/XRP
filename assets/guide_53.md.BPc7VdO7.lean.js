The castle of Methoni occupies the whole area of the cape and the southwestern coast to the small islet that has also been fortified with an octagonal tower and is protected by the sea on its three sides. Its north part, the one that looks to land, is covered by a heavily fortified acropolis. A deep moat separates the castle from the land and communication was achieved by a wooden bridge. The Venetians built on the ancient battlements and added on and repaired it during both periods that they occupied the castle. Description Part of the castle Detail View of the Bourtzi Its entrance is accessed by a stone bridge of 14 arches, that was built over a moat by the technicians of the Exp√©dition scientifique de Mor√©e, that accompanied general Maison. The entrance gate ends in an arch framed on the right and left by pilasters with Corinthian capitals. It is considered to be the work of Venetians after 1700. On the right and left of the entrance two large battlements can be seen. One battlement is the one built by general Antonio Loredan, during the second period of Venetian occupation. Right after the central gate, a domed road opens up that leads through a second gate and then a third in the interior of the castle, where the habitable part was and which was separated from the north part with a vertical low wall (approximately 6 meters), fortified with five towers (four square and one octagonal) is dated to the period after 1500, when the Turks tried to reinforce the population and the fortification of the caste. In the interior there are ruins of the houses where the Venetian lords lived during the period of rise, the paved street that led to the sea gate, the ruins of a Turkish bath, the Byzantine church of St. Sophia, close to which a slate with Latin lettering was found (dating back to 1714), parts of Doric pillars, a monolithic granite pillar (1493/4), unlined, with a capital on the top of Byzantine style, which is supposed to have supported either the winged lion of Saint Mark, the symbol of Venice, or the bust of Morosini. That is why it is erroneously called \\"Morosini's stele\\". There was an inscription on the capital that has not survived to this day. On the left of the entrance are the ruins of the building which originally Imbrahem used as a residence in 1826 and later general Maison. The French of the liberating corps remained in the area till 1833 and the construction of the church of Santa Sotira, which is still attributed to them. In the interior of the castle there are also a few cisterns and the remains of the British prisoner's cemetery during the World War II. On the south part of the walls rises the spectacular sea gate which has recently been restored. A stone-paved stretch leads over a small bridge to the small fortified islet of Bourtzi. This is the place where many soldiers and inhabitants of Methoni were slaughtered, when the Turks occupied the fort in 1500. History The Bourtzi is dated back to the period after 1500 and has been used in various instances as a prison. It has a two-floor octagonal tower. The tower finishes in a round dome. On the lower floor there was a cistern and the whole works, with small defensive value, and is dated during the first period that the Turks occupied the fortress. The west part of the walls is not as well constructed as the others. It was here that during the Second World War, after an explosion, parts of well constructed stones from the ancient walls of Methoni were found. In the interior of the walls, ruins of Turkish military establishments are preserved. The east side of the walls also reached initially to the sea. Nowadays, a long strand of beach lies in front of a large part of it. Parallel to the east wall, up to the Bourtzi, there was a pier and this is where the small fortified harbor was formed (mandrachio), while the big one was to the northeast where ships could be pulled. The long east side has suffered many repairs, performed on the initial venetian battlements of the 13th century, mainly during the second Venetian occupation and the Turkish occupation. In one of the towers parts of the Byzantine fortification are preserved. On various parts of the fortification there are Venetian emblems with the winged lion of St. Mark and inscriptions. This is the case on the north part of the Loredan battlement, where there is an inscribed plaque from the time when general Loredan was in command in the Peloponnese. On the north wall, on the right of the main entrance, there is also a plaque with the coat of arms of the families of the Foscarini, Foscolo and Bembo, to which the inscription denotes the construction of the Bembo battlement, just before 1500.

The concerns by CIA pilots that the Lockheed U-2 was being tracked by radars on spy missions over the Soviet Union prompted Northrop to make low observable technology a part of the N-204 design, as was later done with the Lockheed A-12.Chong, Tony, 2016.

Although Northrop estimated that the N-204 could go into service in 1960, the N-204 project did not proceed to the hardware stage. Design The N-204 was similar to the Lockheed U-2 and Yakovlev Yak-25RV in having long, straight wings like an ordinary sailplane, and a v-tail. However, the engines of the aircraft were not buried in the wing roots or podded under the wings, but instead were buried in the outboard end of the wing center-section.

A total of 80 teams compete in this division, which began on 20 August 2016 and ended on 18 June 2017. Format The competition format consists of two stages. In the first stage, the 80 clubs were divided in eight series of 10 teams, according to geographic criteria. The only exceptions were teams from Madeira, which were placed in the first series, and teams from the Azores, which were distributed through the latter series. In each series, teams play against each other in a home-and-away double round-robin system. In the second stage, the two best-placed teams from each first-stage series were divided in two groups of eight teams, again according to geographic proximity, with home-and-away matches. The two group winners secured promotion to the LigaPro. To determine the overall division champion, the group winners contested a one-off grand final on a neutral ground. On 15 March 2016, the LPFP announced that four teams (instead of three) would be relegated to the 2017‚Äì18 Campeonato de Portugal, and two teams (instead of three) would be promoted directly from the Campeonato de Portugal to reduce the number of LigaPro teams to 20 for the 2017‚Äì18 season. There would also be a two-legged promotion/relegation play-off involving the 17th- and 18th-placed teams of 2016‚Äì17 LigaPro and both second-placed teams of the Campeonato de Portugal promotion groups (North and South). The remaining eight clubs from each first- stage series were divided into eight groups of eight teams, with home-and-away matches, but there was a reshuffle so that teams from Series A, C, E and G ending the first stage from seventh to tenth were placed in the second stage's Series B, D, F and H and vice versa. Each teams only conserved 25% of first- stage points. The bottom-two teams from each group were relegated to the District Championships. The sixth-placed teams were paired into four two- legged play-out ties, with the four winners being paired into two further two- legged play-out ties. All six play-out losers were also relegated.

The airport is located in the southwestern part of the island, about from the port of Parikia. It replaced the Old Paros National Airport on 25 July 2016. History The old airport of Paros, which was situated a few kilometers to the south, was operational since 1982. Its 710-meter runway was sufficient for its time, but over years, passenger numbers grew making the use of larger aircraft necessary. Although these aircraft could serve various Greek airports, Paros airport was not one of them. The reason was that it had a short runway. It was finally decided that there should be a new airport for the island. The new airport opened in 2016 taking over all operations of the old airport. It has a wider, 1,400 meter runway and larger aircraft can use it. The types that fly to the airport currently are the following: Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 of Olympic Air, ATR 42/72 of Sky Express (Greece), BAe 146 & ATR 42/72 of Astra Airlines and B737-700 of Travel Service. Since 8 June 2018, Smartwings, a Czech charter airline, is the first operator to regularly fly with a medium-sized jet to Paros. The flight is operated with a fuel stop at Santorini Airport on the return leg, due to no fuel being available at Paros. Olympic Air, a subsidiary of Aegean Airlines, financed both the construction of the first phase of the terminal and the infrastructure works for the new airport. Airlines and destinations Ground transportation Other than car, the airport is linked to the city of Parikia by bus from the nearby bus station. There are also taxis available to any destination on the island.

It is the deadliest ballooning disaster to ever occur in the United States. Aircraft The aircraft involved was a Kubicek BB85Z hot air balloon, registration N2469L. The balloon was operated by the Heart of Texas Balloon Ride company, which served people in the Greater Austin area. Accident The balloon departed from Fentress Airpark at 06:58 local time (11:58 UTC) on Saturday, July 30, 2016. It was carrying the pilot and fifteen passengers. At 07:42, the aircraft struck power lines and crashed into a field near Lockhart, Texas.NTSB preliminary report All sixteen people on board were killed. The emergency services were alerted at 07:44 about a \\"possible vehicle accident\\", and arrived at the scene to find the basket of the balloon on fire. A witness described hearing two \\"pops\\" which were thought to be a gun going off. Reports said that the balloon lost contact about half an hour into the scheduled one-hour flight. The envelope of the balloon landed about northeast of the burned-out gondola. The flight had covered a distance of about . Investigation The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) led the investigation into what was designated a \\"major accident\\" by the NTSB. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) also secured evidence for the NTSB's investigation. Fourteen personal electronic devices (cellphones, an iPad, and cameras) were recovered from the wreckage. These were turned over to the FBI for the recovery of evidence. The NTSB held an investigative hearing into the accident in December 2016. In October 2017, the NTSB determined the accident was caused by the pilot's \\"pattern of poor decision-making\\" that led him to launch the balloon (on a day when other balloon operators cancelled their planned flights because of low cloud and fog), to continue the flight into fog and above clouds, and then to descend near clouds which made it difficult to see and avoid obstacles. The pilot's medical conditions (depression and ADHD), the prescription drugs he was taking, and the fact that balloon pilots do not need a medical certificate even for commercial flights were contributing factors leading to the accident.NTSB Board Meeting, October 17, 2017 Press Release Abstract Webcast Aftermath On August 1, Heart of Texas Hot Air Balloon Rides, whose owner died in the accident, announced that it would be suspending operations. More than two years later on September 27, 2018, the House of Representatives approved new legislation that would mandate medical exams for commercial balloon pilots.

Her first book Loom: a Novel, published in 2010 by Syracuse University Press, won the 2011 Arab American Book Award. Soukar Chehade lives in western Massachusetts, where she writes and teaches English. Early life and education Th√©r√®se Soukar Chehade was born and raised in Beirut, Lebanon. When she was 12 years old, the civil war broke out, and for the next eight years, she toggled between living the life of an ordinary teenager and hiding from bullets and bombs. In 1983, she moved from Lebanon to Massachusetts. There she enrolled at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where she obtained a Master of Fine Arts in English writing, studying with John Edgar Wideman, as well as a master's degree in English language education. Writing influences Soukar Chehade's writing centers around the civilian experience of living in a war zone, fleeing from war, and having to start a new life from scratch in a new place. She credits Virginia Woolf's \\"To the Lighthouse\\" with inspiring her to write in her non- native English. Loom: A Novel  Synopsis  Chehade's first novel, \\"Loom\\", portrays a Lebanese-American family, the Zaydans, struggling to reconcile generational differences and immigrant identity. On the evening of the arrival of a cousin, Eva, from Lebanon, the Zaydans are sequestered by a blizzard. Amidst the storm, the family matriarch Emilie struggles with English and prefers not to speak. Her eldest daughter, Josephine, still lives at home with her brother George's family and remembers the independence she had in Lebanon. George's daughter, Marie, longs to leave behind her conservative family and head off to Berkeley. With Eva stranded in the storm in New York, and tensions rising, Emilie braves the blizzard to deliver a meal to the mysterious neighbor the Zaydans have nicknamed \\"Loom\\", and the family is forced to leave the metaphorical and actual isolation of their home as they go after her.  Influences  In the novel, Chehade draws heavily from her experiences growing up during the Lebanese Civil War as well as from her life as a young immigrant in New England. Her memories of the war helped to inform the character development of Eva and Salma.  Reception  On release, Loom was recommended by Library Journal magazine, as part of its \\"Fall Firsts\\" purchase list. In Foreword Reviews, Jessica Henkle described the book as an entire story formed within a pause where what ensues over twenty-four hours is spellbinding, revealing a history of secrets and resentments, of undisclosed pain and unshakeable love. Theri Alyce Pickens thought the book was a hauntingly beautiful read, where as the snow falls, the novel‚Äôs pace slows considerably to give room to the characters‚Äô musings, but where this slowness is compensated for by Chehade‚Äôs outstanding skill in developing their memories, painting each with depth and sadness without making them tragic or depressing.

It is black, and looks like a piece of charred wood hanging from a string. It was made by the sailors and fishermen of the coast of Liguria and Versilia; under European law, it may no longer be legally produced or sold. A somewhat similar product in Sicily made from fillet of tuna, often sold as \\"mosciame di tonno\\", is essentially the same as the mojama de at√∫n of Spain.  Production  Musciame was made on board ship by the sailors and fishermen of the Ligurian and Versilian coast, in north- west Italy. Strips of dolphin meat were salted, then hung by a string from the mast to dry in the sun for about a week. The result had the appearance of a small log charred by fire. The meat was black, and became hard if kept for long. Musciame may not legally be sold or produced in Italy. Intentional killing of dolphins is prohibited by the Habitats Directive of the European Union, 92/43/CEE. Under the terms of EU regulation 338/97, where cetaceans are listed in Appendix A, it is illegal to buy, sell or obtain dolphin meat. In 2014, after an expos√© by an investigative reporter from the television programme Le Iene, the Guardia Costiera and the port authorities of Civitavecchia confiscated vacuum-packed musciame destined to be secretly served in a restaurant in the area, and investigated those responsible for trafficking in it. In the same year, the corpse of a young bottlenose dolphin was found butchered on a beach at Golfo Aranci in Sardinia; the , the national league for the protection of animals, said that it had been slaughtered for musciame. According to a report published in 2015 by the , the Italian anti- vivisection league, illegal killing of dolphins for musciame production continues.  Consumption  Musciame was a basic element of the diet of Ligurian seamen, who ate it with ship's biscuit softened with sea-water and vinegar, accompanied by vegetables. It is eaten very thinly sliced; it may be simply seasoned with olive oil, or served on slices of tomato, or accompanied by boiled beans and onion.

The main hero of the poem is American inventor Thomas Alva Edison, considered by the author to be a modern genius. Nezval's work is a praise of human activity, technology, and science, but also an expression of anxiety about civilisation. Nezval compares the inventor's work to writing poetry. He points out that every creative work demands much toil and courage. After Edison's death in 1931 Nezval wrote Sign√°l ƒçasu (Signal of time) which is an elegy. Both poems are written in the same measure, trochaic hexameter.

The site is a kettle hole, a deep pond formed in the void remaining after a submerged glacial calf block melted. Barelees Pond is illustrative of vegetative habitat evolution as peat sediment gradually fills the pond. Location and natural features Barelees Pond is situated in the north-east of England, immediately south of the Anglo- Scottish border in the county of Northumberland, some south-east of the town of Cornhill-on-Tweed. The pond lies within mildly undulating terrain circa above sea level, and is oval in shape, some north to south and east-west. An island has formed to occupy much of the south and midsections of the pond, fringed at the south by a moat of water, the substantial remains of the pond lying to the north end. The local area has a number of other kettle hole ponds; a second, Campfield Kettle Hole, lies west of Barelees. Vegetation Within the perimeter of the island is a carr woodland - in part a quaking bog floating on the pond - supporting birch (Betula sp.) with a carpet of bog mosses including Sphagnum palustre and Sphagnum recurvum. On this are found cotton-grasses such as Eriophorum angustifolium and E. vaginatum, with marsh cinquefoil (Potentilla palustris) and bogbean (Menyanthes trifoliata). The distinct stable central areas of the island supports Scot's pine (Pinus sylvestris) and a ground flora of ling (Calluna vulgaris) and cross-leaved heath (Erica tetralix). A 2009 survey found lichen (Caloplaca luteoalba ) on the birch. The perimeter of the island supports willow (Salix spp.), marsh marigold (Caltha palustris) and bittersweet (Solanum dulcamara). The perimeter of the pond supports soft rush (Juncus effusus), greater pond sedge (Carex riparia) and water plantain (Alisma plantago-aquatica). The perimeter bank supports elder (Sambucus nigra), hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), wild rose (Rosa sp.), rosebay willow herb (Epilobium angustifolium) and common nettle (Urtica dioica). The condition of the geological units of Barelees Pond was judged to be favourable in 2009.

Launched in 2015, its games are played without football helmets or other protective equipment. The A7FL is the only organized level of competition in American 7s football. Its teams are based in the mid- Atlantic region in the states of New Jersey, Maryland and Pennsylvania, as well as San Diego, California. History Founded in 2014 with play commencing the following year, the A7FL plays an eight-game schedule running from March to June. It primarily attracts semi-professional football players seeking opportunities to stay in shape during spring. In 2016, the league participated in a safety study led by the New Jersey Institute of Technology. In 2016 the league reported it had four teams in New York City (in Brooklyn, Long Island, Queens, and The Bronx), four teams in Florida (in Miami, Tampa, Orlando, and Jacksonville), four teams in the deep South (in New Orleans; Baton Rouge; Montgomery, Alabama; and Jackson, Mississippi), and four teams in the northeast (in Newark, New Jersey; Trenton, New Jersey; Philadelphia, and Baltimore), and said it sought to expand to 32 teams by 2017. In 2018 the league had 18 teamshttps://www.a7fl.com/standings/standings-2018/ and in 2020 expanded to 21.https://www.a7fl.com/standings/ There are also considerations towards expanding outside of the United States. Differences from other leagues A7FL players play without pads or helmets as part of what the league describes as an effort to reduce the potential of head injuries resulting from helmet-to-helmet contact. League games also do not include kickoffs, field goals, or punts, and, instead of the kickoff, implement a unique version of special teams called a 3-on-1 throw off (three 'throwing' players and one receiver). Games are played on narrow fields of 37 yards' width (34 m, between one set of hash marks and the furthest sideline away) to accommodate fewer players on the field on each team. A7FL games are played between two seven-man teams; teams are, additionally, required to cap their rosters at 35 active players. Media coverage Eleven Sports Network acquired the exclusive United States and international rights to broadcast the A7FL 2017 Championship on July 9, 2017, played at Palisades Credit Union Park. Through ELEVEN Sports Network's distribution with DirecTV, Verizon FiOS, and AT&T; uVerse the A7FL 2017 Championship was to be accessible by over 70 million homes worldwide. In 2018, Eleven Sports Network acquired the exclusive United States and international rights to broadcast a 21-game package including the playoffs and championship, and in 2019, the non-exclusive U.S. and international rights to the playoffs and championship. In 2019, Twitch acquired the exclusive United States and international rights to a 21-game package of the season including the playoffs and championship. Organization The CEO of the A7FL is Sener Korkusuz and its president is Ryan DePaul. In 2019, UFC co-founder David Isaacs joined the A7FL to serve as chairman of the advisory board. Isaacs said, \\"Removing equipment to make any sport safer seems counterintuitive and we faced similar issues when we launched the UFC and created the sport of mixed martial arts. With the A7FL, football can be safer but still thrilling full-contact competition. I can't wait to get started.\\" Athletes playing in the A7FL are required to sign a player injury waiver and be 18 years of age or older. Once expanded to 32 teams the league will be structured around eight groups divided into two divisions. The teams play each other twice in the group stages with the top two teams going forward to a divisional championship. The winners of the divisional championships will play each other to decide the winner of the championship.

N. Ventouras in his workshop Summary Nikolaos Ventouras was born the 31st of August 1899, in a noble family of the region of Venice, Veneto, which was included in the Libro d'Oro. The family settled on the island of Corfu around 1730. Members of the family defended the island in the Siege of Corfu (1716). In fact one of his ancestors was the writer Isabella Teotochi Albrizzi and Ioannis Kapodistrias, who was his great uncle. He had one brother, married 2 times, had a daughter from his second marriage and a grandson. He studied chemistry but became one of the greatest engravers of the 20th century. He did not study further, but since he was familiar with a number of languages, he acquired his own, deep education, particularly around issues of art and philosophy. It has been written about him \\"if etching had not been discovered, surely he would have discovered it\\". Nikos Ventouras passed on April 1, 1990. The first years As he notes on his resume, drafted in 1981, \\"already from the early classes of elementary school, I was taught sketching\\". In 1916 he took a 2-year class to study chemistry in Athens at the Academy of Commerce and Industry, but never worked as a chemist. Although he had no academic studies on art, his devotion and persistence guided him in his work. During the 20s he served in HMS Ramillies. Nikolas Ventouras was a passionate photographer and never missed a chance to capture 'life' with his Rolleiflex. It is noteworthy that some of his photos were chosen by the National Geographic. He also loved traveling, motorcycles and bicycles. In 1923, from March 16 to May 5 he travelled from Brindisi to Vienna with a group of cyclists. HMSR-Ventouras.jpgHMS Ramillies, picture by N.

Ventouras (1932) and published by the National Geographic Art-History It can be agreed that the starting point of his artistic career were the watercolour lessons he received from Angello Giallina, from 1931 to 1937. He started printmaking, specifically engraving in wood, etching on copper and stone (a relatively new technique, invented by the German Alois Senefelder), as early as 1932, feeling reluctant in respect to his tutor. But engraving won him over and he focused his interest in perfecting it. In his r√©sum√© he notes \\"self-taught excluding lithography which I was taught\\". He took some lithography (etching on stone) courses in 1937. Primarily the evolution of the engraving was personal and he evolved several variations of known techniques. His complete work consists of dry-point, vernis mou, aquarelle, oil, wood etching, copper etching, lithography, lithography on zinc, printing fabric, photogravure, monotypes and custom prints for Ex Libris, books, magazines, stamps, greeting cards etc. The study of chemistry and the study of bees helped him experiment with materials and corrosion times, which helped him achieve the exact level of detail he intended. Due to his persistence and his evolution in the area of etching he is considered a pioneer of printmaking. Art-Style He draws his inspiration mainly from the local tradition of Corfu focusing his on themes of the city life in the Corfu town, rural landscapes and the ships, using the human form only in complementary roles. Other thematic sections, but to a lesser extent, can be identified as his landscapes, the famous Constellations, impressive processions, religious performances and his completely abstract compositions. Color was used to accentuate his feeling and therefore it is not uncommon to find variations of his works with color. Furthermore, he uses the visual styles of the European era with equivalent expressionist, surrealist and cubist elements, which are reflected in his works. With seemingly fast lines that give a capacity in his works, he manages to give an abstract character which differentiates them from conventional standards of his time. This brings etching side by side with the modernist tendencies of Greek art. His works reveal a modernist approach, especially for his time, as the building blocks of visual configurations released by the initial visual stimuli and simultaneously incorporate his personal expression. He uses an expressionist idiom, but not distinguished for its brutality in a more poetic character. Nikolaos Ventouras was the only Greek artist who served printmaking with such dedication, persistence and consistency for over half a century and has maintained throughout his work a morphoplastic idiom. He was very meticulous keeping detailed notes for each work and excellent organization of the workshop, tools, apprenticeship. In the file kept detailed notes, the emotion that he intended to capture, the time of taking a task and when finished, the technique used and materials. Noted that perhaps the same project after a long time or even several years, noting the progress of each project and its progress. The raw materials were thoroughly registered. Especially for paper, he noted weight, type, date and origin and how that affects the result of \\"printing\\". The colors were always clean and he made himself the blend of colours and chemical compounds in order to achieve the desired result. Etching-Ventouras.jpgSome of N.

He also figured out a way to print the etchings without pressure marks and even upside down. He was very strict with his work and made notes -in the judgment of quality performance in his own metric ranging from \\"kachektypon\\" (misprint) all they through to \\"exeretikon\\" (perfect). With these efforts left behind an innovative project rich in expression and meaningful content. Influences From his first works until 1937, Nikolas Ventouras, carves landscapes. His work is calm and filled with light; his subjects come from Corfu and Venice. During the years of the Second World War and immediately after the war, 1945‚Äì1948, he floods his projects with inspiration and expression drawn from post-war ruins, disasters and perspective distortions. His work clearly reveals his psychological state influenced by the historical events. This period can be identified as expressionistic. 1949 to 1950 shows his diversity; few lines, strictly calculated expressing serenity and tranquility, his works are again full of light. 1955 is the year Piraeus changes the scene for Ventouras. He introduces plurality in intercepting forms which, in time, are simplified. He uses, smokestacks, winches and cranes whatever is necessary in the background to complement the harbour, and show how live it is. His lines and some ‚Äúdrops‚Äù of color complete his works. Mr. Manolis Hatzidakis in a 1963 speech given at the \\"Athens Technological Institute\\" notes: [...] By simplifying things, we would say that we feel to exhale from the work of Mr Ventoura a new lyrical sense of the world ernment so disciplined to laws purely disciplinary. People, landscapes and people, transformed into works of art by a lyrical fantasy goes beyond appearances and things and which found expression within too simple: the search for the essential, and the rejection of unnecessary lent the works of Mr. Ventoura a cleaner spiritual quality. [...] His work In 1928 he illustrated an ethography of Constantine Theotoki \\"The Life and Death of Karavela\\", using India ink. The illustration was bought by Vassileiou's publishing house and the relevant printing plates were created. Before these are printed, Mr. Vassileiou passes, and the project stops. Finally, in 1961 his son issued the book with a small number of the drawings as they could not find all of the printing plates. The prints carry the nickname N. G. Viros (as per Ventouras‚Äô request) He worked and was friends with other major Greek artists such as Nikos Hadjikyriakos-Ghikas, Alamanos Spyros and Eleni Vakalo. He first presented his work in Athens, at the 1948 Panhellenic Art Exhibition in Athens and continued to exhibit his work every year until 1969. Nikolaos Ventouras has participated in individual, group and international exhibitions in Greece and abroad. It is noteworthy to mention that he also participated at the Biennale of S√£o Paulo (1955,1957), the Alexandria Biennale (1957), the Venice Biennale (1964). In 1982, four of his prints were added to the British Museum department of Prints and Drawings with the famous Easter procession from the church of St Nicholas being one among them, along his personal favourites, The bend in the road. His first solo exhibition was presented in 1963 at the Athens Institute of Technology. A retrospective exhibition of his work was held a year after his death, in 1991 in Athens. Art Gallery Hyacinth. On May 29, 2016 the ‚ÄúMunicipal Art Gallery‚Äù in Corfu opens its doors to a retrospective exhibition, in memory of \\"Nikolaos, Ada and Fanny Ventoura‚Äù, and is titled ‚ÄúPersistently Modern‚Äù. The largest retrospective exhibition to date was curated by his grandson and presented at the Piraeus Annex of the Benaki Museum in 2017. It featured over 500 original works of art as well as notes, sketches and studies.

He is best known for his donation which helped found Barnes-Jewish Hospital.  Life  Barnes was born in Washington, D.C., but moved to Louisville, Kentucky at the age of thirteen after the death of his father. He moved to St. Louis in 1830 and began working in a mercantile house. Soon afterwards, he began his own grocery business and held partnerships with prominent St. Louis businessmen. In 1845, he married Louise DeMun. The couple had two children together, although neither child lived past infancy. In the early 1840s, Barnes became the president of the Bank of the State of Missouri. He stayed with the bank for 26 years while simultaneously working as an executive in other St. Louis-based companies, such as the St. Louis Railroad Company.  Legacy  Robert Barnes was a philanthropist during his lifetime, but his greatest contribution came after this death. Because he had no children with whom to leave his fortune, he instead chose to leave a one million dollar bequest in his will for the foundation of a hospital. Barnes wanted to build \\"a modern general hospital for sick and injured persons, without distinction of creed...\\" His generosity, together with funds raised from the Jewish community in St. Louis, gave rise to what is now the Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri.

It is known from Sri Lanka through southeast Asia and the Philippines to Polynesia. Description The rhizomes are radially symmetric (without distinct upper and lower surfaces) and bear whorls of stipes, which lack a joint at the point of attachment. The rhizome scales are red-brown, of uniform color, and usually glossy. They have unbranched, red-brown hairs on their edges. Hairs, where present, are unbranched and branched, and brown in color. The leaf blades are usually pinnate in cutting, rarely pinnatifid or bipinnatifid, bearing free veins which lack hydathodes at their terminus. Sori are borne in two rows beneath pinnae or lobes. The sori are circular to elliptic in shape; the sporangia either lack hairs or have one to two red- brown hairs. Taxonomy The genus was first described by Barbara Parris in 2007 to receive some of the species of the genus Grammitis, which as then circumscribed was artificial and contained a number of disparate lineages. The name \\"Dasygrammitis\\" means \\"shaggy Grammitis\\", referring to the shaggy hairs often present on the frond in this group of former Grammitis species. Parris initially placed six species in the genus. A phylogenetic study of the grammitids found that Dasygrammitis was sister to a clade consisting of Calymmodon, Micropolypodium, Scleroglossum, Tomophyllum, and Xiphopterella. These six genera share a radially symmetric rhizome, which may be a synapomorphy for this clade (although the trait appears in other grammitid taxa, probably independently). Species , the Checklist of Ferns and Lycophytes of the World accepted the following species: *Dasygrammitis brevivenosa (Alderw.)

The autos-da-f√© of 1688 On the afternoon of Sunday March 7, 1688, a group of xueta (Majorcan Jewish) families from Palma tried to flee the island on an English ship, but the vessel failed to set sail and they returned to their homes; however, they were discovered by Mallorcan Catholics, and as a result they were quickly imprisoned. Unlike the captured during the \\"Conspiracy of 1678\\", almost all the conversos were declared Jews and they refused to repent of their intention to return to Judaism in the countries where it was permitted. The trials were conducted during three years. In 1688, apparently because of the tortures that were applied on them, her parents and her sister Francina died.

Many Hakka Americans have connections to Hakka diaspora in Jamaica, the Caribbean, South East Asia, Latin America, and South America. The Han characters for Hakka () literally mean \\"guest families\\". Unlike other Han ethnic groups, the Hakkas are not named after a geographical region, e.g. a province, county or city. The Hakkas usually identify with people who speak the Hakka language or share at least some Hakka ancestry. The earliest Hakka immigrants to what is now the United States mostly went to Hawaii, starting when the Kingdom of Hawaii was an independent sovereign state. After the lifting of the Chinese Exclusion Act by the passage of the Magnuson Act in 1943, the Hakka began to come to the US from Taiwan and to a lesser extent Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, Jamaica and the Caribbean. Countries of Origin Taiwan The first wave of Taiwanese migration to the United States involved mostly post-World War II immigrants from the area now ruled by China (Waishengren), most of whom were not Hakka. Later, the other Taiwanese people, whose ancestors arrived in Taiwan before 1945, including many Hakkas, started immigrating in larger numbers after the 1960s.Lai, Him Mark. Becoming Chinese American: A History of Communities and Institutions. p. 243 It is estimated that there are currently over 20,000 Taiwanese Hakka in the United States. Mainland China Some Hakka Americans came from Meizhou (also called Kaying or Jiaying), Guangdong, China, or otherwise have ancestral roots in that area. A small number of Hakka came to the continental US before the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act. Some Hakka also went to Hawaii, where they consisted a significant minority of the population. Jamaica During the 1960s and 1970s, substantial migration of Jamaican Hakkas to the USA and Canada occurred.Hakka Chinese Jamaican - History Global Hakka p. 196 Most Chinese Jamaicans are Hakka; they have a long history in Jamaica. Between 1854 and 1884, nearly 5000 Hakkas arrived in Jamaica in three major voyages, with some of them subsequently going to the United States. Many of these people also have African ancestry.Global Hakka p. 166 Distribution in the US Hawaii A significant minority of early Chinese immigrants to Hawaii, and even fewer to the Continental US, were Hakka, and much of the animosity between the Hakka and Punti Cantonese people carried over. In the first half of the 1800s, around 30 percent of Chinese in Hawaii were of Hakka, while only about 3 percent in the West Coast were Hakka. There was a communal ban on intermarriages between the two groups for the first generation of migrants.Mixed Blood: Intermarriage and Ethnic Identity in Twentieth-century America, Paul R. Spickard In the middle of the 19th century, Hakka immigrants in America were excluded from membership in the Chinese organizations. The largest surge of immigration in that century occurred after an 1876 treaty between the US and Kingdom of Hawaii led to an increased need for labor. Chinese revolutionary leader Sun Yat-sen lived in Hawaii for several years during his youth. Organizations Many organizations have been formed to promote Hakka culture in the US. One group is the New England Hakka Association, which reminds its members not to forget their roots. One example is a blog by Ying Han Brach called \\"Searching for My Hakka Roots\\". Another group is the Hakka Association of New York, which aims to promote Hakka culture across the five boroughs of New York City. In the mid 1970s, the Hakka Benevolent Association in San Francisco (San Francisco Jiaying Association) was founded by Tu Chung. The association has strong ties with the San Francisco community and offers scholarships to their young members. The most prominent association in Hawaii is the Tsung Tsin Association (), which was founded in Honolulu in 1918 under the name Nin Fo Fui Kon (). It provides scholarships to US citizens in Hawaii that are preferably of Hakka background and/or interested in the Hakka culture. Languages The American Community Survey reported that 1,350 people in the United States speak Hakka at home. The actual number may be much higher because some respondents just filled out their response as \\"Chinese\\". Some Hakka Americans speak Mandarin Chinese or Cantonese instead. Cuisine There are some restaurants in the U.S. serving Hakka cuisine. American food writer Linda Lau Anusasananan wrote a popular Hakka cookbook simply titled, The Hakka Cookbook (University of California Press, 2014).

On the monuments relating to Sobekhotep III, Mentuhotep bears the title god's father. The latter title is often given to non-royal fathers of kings. Furthermore, from a high number of scarab seals there is known a military official with the title commander of the ruler's crew. This official had a son with the same title named Sobekhotep.

Shevinsky co-founded Glimpse, an encrypted photo and video-sharing app, with Pax Dickinson in 2013. At Glimpse, Shevinksy served as chief executive of the company. During her time at Glimpse, she experienced conflict with Dickinson over his defense of a pair of app developers accused of misogyny. He wrote on Twitter: \\"It is not misogyny to tell a sexist joke, or to fail to take a woman seriously, or to enjoy boobies\\". A few days afterwards, Shevinsky quit her job at Glimpse, citing the Twitter controversy as her reasoning. Shevinsky returned to Glimpse in December 2013, after Dickinson published an apology letter. In an agreement formed with Dickinson, Shevinsky would be the chief executive and public face of the company, would have to sign off on what he said in press conferences, and Glimpse would support women in technology. After Glimpse, Shevinsky was funded by MACH37 for Jekudo Privacy Company. In 2016, Shevinsky joined Brave as Head of Product. Current career Shevinsky has spoken and written on enterprise security policy. She spoke on the potential for social media to influence election outcomes at HOPE XI. Shevinsky is the founder and organizer of SecretCon. As of 2018, Shevinsky is speaking on information security at universities and infosec conferences. She is chief operating officer of SoHo Token Labs, building developer tools for smart contracts. Honors In 2018, Shevinsky was named \\"Woman of the Decade\\" by Williams College in a speech where she announced she wanted to lead the way for the development and protection of privacy for the following decade. Personal life Shevinsky considered herself \\"a GamerGate neutral\\". In a 2015 post, Shevinsky wrote: \\"I'd like to see less harassment. That's my position. Less harassment, for everyone. I do hope this isn't a controversial statement.\\" When James Damore was fired by Google, Shevinsky was widely quoted saying that speech \\"questioning the technical qualifications of people based on race or gender\\" was potentially within the purview of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, and national origin. As a Press Lead for the 2018 HOPE conference in NYC, Shevinsky called for stronger enforcement of the Code of Conduct.

Griffith Dodson, The General Assembly of Virginia (1940-1960) p. 497 A member of the Byrd Organization, Ames was also a member of the new legislative Boatwright Committee which investigated the NAACP as part of the Massive Resistance to racial integration vowed by U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd after the U.S. Supreme Court decisions in Brown v. Board of Education. Early and family life Ames was borne in Onley, Virginia in January 1903 to Edward Almer Ames (1856-1939) and his wife Lena E. Trower (1872-). He had an elder brother Floyd (1896-1972) and sister Margaret (b. 1899), as well as a younger sister Ethel (1909-2003). Almer Ames attended Randolph-Macon College, and joinedPhi Delta Phi and Phi Beta Kappa before graduating with a B.A. degree. He then attended Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia and won election to the Order of the Coif before graduating with a LLB degree. He married Elizabeth Johnson Melson in January 1936, and they had a son, E. Almer Ames III. Career After admission to the Virginia bar, Ames practiced law with his father. During World War II, Accomack County voters elected Ames commonwealth attorney (prosecutor), and he served from 1943 until 1955. He was also vice-president (then President) and a director of the First National Bank in Onancock, which later was bought by First Virginia Bancshares, Inc.. From 1948 until 1967, Ames was chairman of the Accomack County Democratic Party, and beginning in 1955 on the Virginia Democratic State Central Committee. He was also active in the Freemasons (past master), Rotary Club, Ruritan Club and various bar associations. In 1955 after V. Alfred Etheridge who represented 1st senatorial district announced his retirement, Ames won the Democratic primary, defeating Accomack's delegate in the Virginia House, Wrendo M. Godwin, and later won the general election. The first district then included Accomack and Northampton Counties on the Virginia's Eastern Shore, as well as Princess Anne County that Etheridge had represented as commonwealth's attorney before winning the part-time state senate position). Redistricting (or the town's incorporation) added Virginia Beach. Ames first won election as the Massive Resistance to racial integration in the public schools grew. The Virginia General Assembly passed the Stanley Plan in a special session that began in September 1956. Among the many laws in the package were seven expanding the common law legal offenses of champerty, maintenance, barratry, running and capping, as well as the statutory violation of unauthorized practice of law. Two joint legislative committees were created to investigate the NAACP (which was pursuing the legal cases to desegregate Virginia schools) as well as desegregation advocates more generally. The President of the Virginia Senate appointed the newly elected Ames and fellow former Commonweath Attorney Earl A. Fitzpatrick of Roanoke (who became Vice- Chairman of the new Committee on Offenses against the Administration of Justice); the Speaker of the House of Delegates appointed veteran delegate and attorney John B. Boatwright to chair the Committee, with newcomer William F. Stone (later elected to the state Senate) and veteran J. J. Williams Jr. as the remaining members. Shortly after the January 1957 session began, the committee issued letters requesting information from the NAACP, as well as the Defenders of State Sovereignty and Individual Liberties and other segregationist organizations, and during the next month began subpoenaing NAACP membership lists. These activities prompted NAACP motions to quash the subpoenas in Richmond and several Virginia counties. In March, the Boatwright Committee formerly opined that various segregationist organizations did not commit the newly expanded legal offenses of champerty, maintenance, barratry, running and capping, nor the unauthorized practice of law. However, the commission's report issued November 13, 1957 recommended enforcement of those laws against the various named NAACP lawyers.Report of the Committee on offenses against the administration of Justice, pp. 19, 20 The subpoenas and other activities soon reduced NAACP membership in Virginia by half, and two years later, Boatwright was still complaining that the Virginia State Bar was not punishing those lawyers but instead spending $5000 on a Jamestown commemoration and $6350 on a new continuing legal education program.Robert A. Pratt, The Color of Their Skin: Education and Race in Richmond Virginia 1954-89 (Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia, 1992) at pp. 8-9James R. Sweeney, Race, Reason and Massive Resistance: the diary of David J. Mays (University of Georgia Press, 2008) p. 176Richmond Style Weekly, July 15, 2009 p. 14 Meanwhile, on January 19, 1959, both a three-judge federal panel and the Virginia Supreme Court declared the Stanley Plan unconstitutional. Ultimately, the Boatwright committee's handiwork was declared unconstitutional in NAACP v. Button, as had the practices of the Thomson committee (also established in the Stanley Plan) in Scull v. Virginia ex rel. Committee on Law Reform & Racial Activities back in May 1958, just before the interim Harrison v. NAACP had temporarily sent the NAACP case to the Virginia Supreme Court for interpretation. When the Virginia Supreme Court only invalidated one of the seven anti-NAACP laws, the NAACP case returned to the U.S. Supreme Court, where it was argued in 1961, then reargued in late 1962 before the 6 to 3 decision was issued in January 1963. Unlike fellow committee member Fitzpatrick, Ames was re-elected in both 1959 and 1963. In 1967, William E. Fears, a World War II Air Force veteran and Democrat who served as Accomack County's Commonwealth attorney and who had long disagreed with Byrd Democrats Charles M. Lankford and Ames, defeated Ames in the Democratic primary.William Fears, The Brass Ring (1st World Publishing 2002) at pp. 80, 192-193 Redistricting after passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as well as the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Davis v. Mann meant the First Senatorial District encompassed conservative Accomack and Northampton Counties on the Eastern Shore, as well as Mathews, Gloucester and York Counties on the peninsula (which included liberal Williamsburg with its College of William and Mary). In later reorganizations, Virginia Beach joined Chesapeake and Portsmouth which became the 3rd District, collectively represented by three senators.Cynthia Miller Leonard (ed), The General Assembly of Virginia 1619-1978: A Bicentennial Register of Members (Richmond, 1978) Although Byrd Democrats greatly resented Fears' election over Ames (and Stone approached him in the Senate chamber to tell him so), and Fears had opponents in both the primary and general elections in 1971, he was re-elected and served two decades in the state Senate, until defeated in 1991 by Republican Tommy Norment of Virginia Beach. Death Ames died in the N.A.M. hospital at Nassawadox in Northampton County, Virginia on May 19, 1987, and was buried in the Mt. Holly cemetery in Onancock near his father and later his wife Elizabeth Melson Ames (1906-2000).Virginia Death Record References 1903 births 1987 deaths Washington and Lee University alumni Virginia state senators People from Accomack County, Virginia Randolph‚ÄìMacon College alumni Virginia Democrats 20th-century American politicians ","title":"E.

In 1888, he was awarded the title of \\"Artist\\". The following year, he transferred to the Imperial Academy of Arts; studying with Bogdan Willewalde and Carl Wenig.Brief biography @ Russian Paintings, War Poster from 1914, encouraging people to support wounded soldiers After graduating he went to Kharkiv to teach at a trade school. He returned to Moscow in 1896 and found work providing illustrations for the publisher . In 1896, he became a teacher at the Stroganov Moscow State University of Arts and Industry (a position he would hold until 1913). Two years later, he began exhibiting with the Peredvizhniki. In 1903, he became one of the founders of the \\"Union of Russian Artists\\". He was named an \\"Academician\\" in 1912 and became a member of the Academy in 1916. During World War I, he lived in Gurzuf at a dacha owned by Konstantin Korovin. While there, he focused on painting military scenes and designing posters. After the war, he helped to decorate the Moscow Kremlin, on the occasion of the first anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution. In 1923, he helped organize a travelling exhibition of Russian art and accompanied the exhibition to its first showing in New York. Upon his return, he settled in Riga, where he initially taught at the studios of Nikolai Bogdanov-Belsky, then established his own private school. Although he concentrated on landscapes at that time, he also worked in other genres; notably a series of portraits depicting the priests at Nativity Cathedral. In the early 1930s, he wrote a series of memoirs about the pre-revolutionary Russian art scene which were published in Segodnya. He died of pneumonia in 1938.

The company was founded for the purpose of improving river navigation which in the post- colonial United States era of the 1790s meant improving river systems, not canals. In this Pennsylvania scheme, however, two rivers, a large river, the Susquehanna and a smaller one, the Schuylkill were to be improved by clearing channels through obstructions and building dams where needed. To connect the two watersheds, the company proposed a four-mile summit level crossing at Lebanon Pennsylvania, a length of almost eighty miles between the two rivers. The completed project was intended to be part of a navigable water route from Philadelphia to Lake Erie and the Ohio valley. The original engineering concept developed by the Society as well as the navigation company's charter had been to build a canal up to the Schuylkill valley to Norristown, improving the Schuylkill river from there to Reading; while from Reading a canal was to extend to the Susquehanna, via Lebanon. This would have required a four-mile summit crossing between Tulpehocken and the Quitipahilla with an artificial waterway connecting two separate river valleys; namely the Susquehanna and the Schuylkill watersheds. Its successful completion would have made the middle reach, the first summit-level canal in the United States. The term refers to a canal that rises then falls, as opposed to a lateral canal, which has a continuous fall only. In this case, the proposed canal at 80 miles in length would rise 192 feet over 42 miles from the west at the Susquehanna river to the summit and then fall 311 feet over 34 miles to the Schuylkill river to the east. It was to be the \\"golden link\\" between Philadelphia and the vast interior of Pennsylvania and beyond. This proposed summit crossing offered a severe test of 18th-century engineering skills, materials and construction techniques. For both designing and operating a water-conveyance transportation system through an area where sinkholes are common, and surface water is scarce. Ultimately, the 1794 engineering concept was flawed as the water supply for the summit crossing was inadequate and the technology for minimizing supply losses was still another century away. While the 1794 construction was never completed, the company's successor, the Union canal was faced with the same challenges of sealing the canal bed to conserve water. The summit crossing never was able to handle the canal traffic. Even with two reservoirs constructed at the summit as feeders to the canal, the Union canal still required pumped water from a waterworks at the junction of Swatara Creek and Clarke's run and later from a second waterworks on Furnace Creek on the Quitipahilla. At the first works, there were four pumps necessary to provide summit water but only two could be powered by river water, the other two had to be powered by Cornish steam engines, a technology available in 1828 when the canal opened but not in 1791. By 1885, the successor company, the Union canal was sold at a sheriff sale, being unable to cope with railroad competition, poor planning, and the technical challenges posed by a summit crossing underlain by the carbonate bedrock of Lebanon County, Pennsylvania. Had the Schuylkill and Susquehanna navigation company been successful in completing the canal in 1794-95, it probably would have succumbed to the same poor planning and summit geology as its successor did. Much like the Potomac canal (1785-1828), between the beginning of the Navigation company in 1791 and its merger and completion by its successor company in 1828, the Union canal of Pennsylvania (1811-1885), \\"...civil engineering had come to America and Americans had become civil engineers.\\"Kapsch, Robert J. \\"George Washington, the Potomac Canal and the Beginning of American Civil Engineering: Engineering Problems and Solutions.\\" American Civil Engineering History: The Pioneering Years. 2003. 129-194. Despite all of these problems, in 1791, the enthusiasm for this venture was such that it didn't seem at all impossible that Pennsylvania would have succeeded in securing the commercial prestige which the (Erie) canal captured for New York State. By 1795 however, the navigation company's project was a commercial failure. The result was that with the onset of the Erie canal still some thirty years into the future, Philadelphia lost the early initiative in water transportation. Despite Philadelphia and Pennsylvania's \\"heroic efforts\\" to hold their share of the internal trade which in 1796 was forty percent more than New York; by 1825 with the opening of the Erie canal, Philadelphia's trade was forty-five percent less than New York. New York's rise to pre-eminence among American cities was an important development but was not a foregone conclusion. At the time the Schuylkill and Susquehanna navigation company was chartered, Philadelphia was the leading American city; its residents, as well as others, generally expected it to take on more of a metropolitan role as the nation became independent, and prepared the city for that role. Instead, Philadelphia slid into second place. By 1807, New York was the acknowledged commercial capital of the nation; by 1837, it was the American metropolis. Philadelphia's dismal failure to build the \\"golden link\\" thirty years before New York opened the Erie canal was a major factor of that slide into second place. William Penn's plan for a second settlement in Pennsylvania The idea of uniting the Schuylkill and Susquehanna rivers by a canal was first proposed and discussed by William Penn in 1690.Engineering Record, Building Record and Sanitary Engineer, Volume 40, Charles Frederick Wingate, McGraw Publishing Company, 1899 Accessed at Google books on July 30, 2016Bishop, Avard Longley. The State works of Pennsylvania. Vol. 13. Tuttle, Morehouse & Taylor Press, 1907. Penn's plan, conceived a few years after he had founded Philadelphia was to make \\"a second settlement\\" on the Susquehanna river, similar in size to that of Philadelphia itself. He made this plan, titled \\"Some Proposals for a Second Settlement in the Province of Pennsylvania\\" public in England in 1690.Swank, James Moore. \\"Progressive Pennsylvania: A Record of the Remarkable Industrial Development of the Keystone State, with Some Account of Its Early and Its Later Transportation Systems, Its Early Settlers, and Its Prominent Men.\\" JB Lippincott, 1908. Accessed at on July 31, 2016. The route envisioned by Penn was a road up the west bank of the Schuylkill to the mouth of French Creek near present-day Phoenixville heading west to the Susquehanna via present day Lancaster and a Susquehanna tributary, Conestoga Creek. Although Penn first proposed the project of continuous water transportation from the Delaware to the Susquehanna, he did not call for the building of a canal. Early Petitions In 1762, Philadelphia merchants petitioned the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly to commission a project for the passage by water up the west branch of the Susquehanna River with an intervening portage to a navigable branch of the Ohio River. In 1769, another petition to the Assembly requested that then Province make the Juniata River navigable down to the Susquehanna River. Both petitions were unsuccessful but neither mentioned canals as an essential element for the proposed improvement. River Surveys of 1769-1773 In 1769, the American Philosophical Society with Benjamin Franklin as its first president was organized with six standing committees, one of which was on \\"Husbandry and American Improvements\\".Volume 1769-1774. (1885). Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, 22(119), 23-94. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/982528 One of the first projects the committee looked in February, 1769 was a canal between the Chesapeake and Delaware bays using the Chester River in Maryland and Duck creek, near Smyrna, Delaware some fifteen miles south of the present location of the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal (C&D; Canal). In March, the committee was tasked with preparing a \\"scheme of application\\" for the Philadelphia merchants for defraying the expenses of conducting a route location (\\"proper levels\\") for the canal as well as construction costs. In April, the committee discussed a more northerly route using the Bohemia River, a tributary of the Elk river with headwaters extending into Delaware using Drawyers Creek . In June, this route was reported being feasible only with locks as the cost of constructing a clear passage from river to river was to great. That same month, Thomas Gilpin, a member of the merchant committee submitted an alternative \\"plan of a canal and elevation\\" using the original southerly route along the Chester river and Duck creek. In April 1770, W. T. Fisher produced a map of the several canal routes proposed for connecting the Chesapeake and Delaware bays. In August 1771, the committee then became aware of the prospect of joining the Susquehanna and Schuylkill rivers by means of a canal. One of the key features of that survey was its emphasis on the middle ground or summit level, roughly four and a half miles between the headwaters of the Quitapahilla, near Lebanon, and those of Tulpehocken, near Myerstown. The survey was conducted by Dr. William Smith, Provost of the College of Philadelphia, John Lukens, Esquire, Surveyor Generalhttp://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-nr92038163/ of the then Province (now State) of Pennsylvania, and John Sellers. Samuel Rhoads, a Philadelphia architect, vice-president of the Society and colonial mayor of Philadelphia had also been on the survey with Rittenhouse and company.Stapleton, D. H. (1984). William Weston, Benjamin Henry Latrobe, and the Philadelphia plan for internal improvements. (Cutcliffe, Stephen Hosmer. ed. Science and technology in the eighteenth century.) Bethlehem, Pa. Rhoads had been impressed with the \\"... apparent practicality of a canal on the Tulpehocken-Swatara route. But, he asked Franklin, whether it was better to dig a canal, or just to dam up the rivers and creeks to provide for navigation?\\" That same year the Society recommended the third route for a canal. The Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly then appointed a committee of its own to survey the Susquehanna, Schuylkill, and Lehigh Rivers and in 1773, David Rittenhouse delivered its report.8 Pa. Arch., viii, 6609‚Äì10, 6748, 6853; Brooke Hindle, David Rittenhouse (Princeton, 1964), pp. 94‚Äì6.Accessed at on August 18, 2016. Nothing became of this work due to the coming of the Revolution.David Rittenhouse Papers accessed at on August 18, 2016. In total, the Society sponsored studies of three routes to the connect Philadelphia with the Susquehanna Valley, one by canal across the Delmarva peninsula(1769-1771), the second was a paved road from the Susquehanna Valley to a river port south of Philadelphia and the third (1773) was a canal using the Schuylkill and Susquehanna rivers and their tributaries, the Tulpehocken and Swatara creeks. Society for the Improvement of Roads and Inland Navigation The project became the goal of the Society for the Improvement of Roads and Inland Navigation organized in 1789 with preeminent, wartime financier Robert Morris as president, David Rittenhouse, William Smith and John Nicolson. The Society petitioned the General Assembly to again survey the river routes, only this time the State acted upon the recommendations. Pennsylvania State River Surveys of 1790 A 1791 map exhibiting a general view of the roads and inland navigation of Pennsylvania, and part of the adjacent states based upon the river surveys of 1790/1791. In the spring of 1790, the General Assembly passed a resolution on Mar. 31, 1790 that authorized river surveys.Baer, Christopher T. \\"A General Chronology of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company Predecessors and Successors and its Historical Context.\\" Archived from the original on (2007), updated May 2015.Accessed at on July 31, 2016. Governor Thomas Mifflin commissioned Timothy Matlack (1736‚Äì1829), Samuel Maclay (1741‚Äì1811) and John Adlum (1759‚Äì1836) to survey the Swatara, West Branch of the Susquehanna River, Allegheny River, French Creek with a portage to Lake Erie; the Kiskiminetas/Conemaugh to Stony Creek, the future site of Johnstown, with a second portage to the Frankstown branch of the Juniata and then down the Juniata to the Susquehanna River and onto Harrisburg. Mifflin also appointed other survey teams: *Commissioners Samuel Boyd, Bartram Galbraith and Thomas Hulings who reported that Conowago Falls, 14 miles above Wright's Ferry, was a major obstruction to the navigation of the Susquehanna River. They reported on January 30, 1790, that \\"Conewago Falls, about 14 miles above Wright's Ferry, the great obstruction and barr to the wealth and population of our Western Country, is at present the grand object. We are clear that a canal is the sure and safe way of effecting a good navigation for boats to pass and repass.\\" *Commissioners Reading Howell (1743-1827), Frederick Antes (1764-1801) and William Dean to survey the upper Delaware with a portage to the Great Bend on the Susquehanna, the North Branch, the upper Lehigh with a portage to Wyoming, and the upper Schuylkill and Little Schuylkill with a portage to the Lehigh or Susquehanna. * Maclay surveyed the Swatara and Quitapahilla Creeks to Old's Iron Works, then by land to Lebanon. Continuing to survey a gap in the Allegheny barrier range in early September 1790, Maclay determined that Poplar Run Gap is the potential site for a future road across the Allegheny Mountains. In April 1790, Maclay surveyed \\"...the Swatara Creek and Quitapahilla Creek to Old's Iron Works, then by to Lebanon; (noting that) the Quitapahilla can be made navigable for boats of 5 tons.\\" On Dec. 14, 1790, Maclay and the other commissioners reported on their recommendations for rivers west of the Allegheny front or barrier range. They recommend three routes; one via the Juniata and two using the West branch. The first uses the Juniata to go over the barrier range at Poplar Run gap to the Kiskiminetas, a tributary of the Allegheny River. The two West branch of the Susquehanna river routes, one via the north branch of Sinnemahoning creek, a tributary of the West branch and thence over the barrier range to the Allegheny river, and one via west branch of the Sinnemahoning creek and thence also over the barrier range to the Allegheny river. They also recommended the Allegheny and French Creek with portage to Lake Erie.Pennsylvania State Archives,House Journal, Appendix, pps 28 - 43 Maclay and the other commissioners found that most of the waterways could be constructed but several portages were recommended to reduce costs such as the Lebanon summit crossing of four miles, a road from French creek to Presque isle on Lake Erie and an eighteen-mile portage over the Allegheny mountains at Poplar run. The latter crossing was south of the route eventually selected in 1831 for the Portage railroad which when built was thirty-six miles in length. Both the 1791 and 1831 routes converged on the Little Conemaugh River as the route into Pittsburgh. On Feb. 10, 1791, reports were given on the second round of river surveys regarding improvements to the Delaware River from the bay to the New York state line. Improvements were also recommended for the Schuylkill river with a portage road or canal from Reading to the Susquehanna River as well as improvements for the North and West Branches of the Susquehanna and a second Allegheny portage to reach Lake Erie. A 1792 map exhibiting a proposed route for the summit canal based upon Brindley's survey of 1791. =Susquehanna and Schuylkill Navigation = The Society proposed in its 1791 report to use the Schuylkill river itself from Philadelphia up to \\"...Tulpehocken Creek, near Reading, continuing on the Tulpehocken as far as practicable.\\"Hartman, J. Lee. \\"Pennsylvania's Grand Plan of Post-Revolutionary Internal Improvement.\\" The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography 65.4 (1941): 439-457. Critically, the Society had yet to recommend or devise way over the summit near Lebanon joining the \\"...Quitapahilla and Swatara creeks, the latter leading to the Susquehanna ...\\" river. The proposed mileages were:Hazard, Samuel, ed. Register of Pennsylvania. Vol. II., 1828. Accessed at on July 15, 2018 * Up the Schuylkill river from Philadelphia to the mouth of the Tulpehocken, near Reading - 61 miles. * Westward, up the Tulpehocken creek to the east end of the proposed summit canal crossing -37 miles. The scheme was to clear thirty miles of the creek and cut a canal (twenty feet wide by seven feet deep) for the last seven miles up to the summit crossing. An estimated ten locks were needed to ascend this distance. * Length of the summit canal - 4 miles. Here the scheme was to dig a canal on average twenty- five feet deep and thirty feet wide, a distance of approximately four and a half miles. This was also assumed to common earth excavation. * Down Quitipahilla to Swatara, - - 15 miles. The 1791 report offered no detail on how this estimate was derived. * Down Swatara to Susquehanna River - - 23 miles. The 1791 report offered no detail on how this estimate was derived. The concept of navigation in the context of the post-colonial United States and 1790 timeframe was predominately focused on improving river systems. A contemporary project, the Western Inland Lock Navigation Company in New York which later became a part of the Erie Canal was also \\"... primarily a river system.\\" In the Pennsylvania scheme, large rivers such as the Susquehanna and to a lesser extent, the Schuylkill were to be improved by clearing channels through obstructions and building dams where needed. Most importantly, these larger segments of the scheme were to be connected by short sections of slackwater canals and in some instances such as the allegheny range crossing, portages.

The Society in its report estimated the total cost of the Schuylkill river improvements and canal connection with the Susquehanna river at ¬£55,540 (1791¬£s) or $8.6 million (2018$US). The Schuylkill Navigation Company and the Union canal ultimately completed this Society scheme by 1830 for a total reported cost of $2.8 million (1830$sUS) or $73 million in (2018$US) Calculated using this website roughly nine times the original estimate. Brindley Surveys of 1791 James Brindley (1745-1820) a well-known canal engineer and nephew of the famous British canal engineer James Brindley (1716-1772) was in Delaware in 1791.Robert J Kapsch & Yvonne E Long (2011) James Brindley, American Canal Engineer, The International Journal for the History of Engineering & Technology, 81:1, 22-59, DOI:10.1179/175812110X12869022260114 Brindley had been originally recruited in 1774 by the Potomac Company for the Little Falls Bypass Canal on the Potomac River.Robert J Kapsch & Yvonne E Long (2011) James Brindley, American Canal Engineer, The International Journal for the History of Engineering & Technology, 81:1, 22-59, Subsequently, Brindley worked on the Susquehanna Canal (1783-) in Maryland, Santee Canal in South Carolina (1786) and the James River Canal, Virginia (1787). In 1791, he was introduced to the Society for the purpose of resurveying the 1771 summit route for the canal between the Tulpehocken and Quittapahilla Creeks. The Society engaged Brindley to resurvey the 1771 summit route along with Timothy Matlack (1736-1829) and John Adlum (1759-1836). Later that year in the summer, they presented a final report and Brindley's map for the summit canal between the creeks. Crucially, they find that there is sufficient water at the summit to feed the canal within a four- mile radius. The society would later in February 1792 ask the newly incorporated Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation company to pay for the expense of this survey. Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation Company In that same year of 1791, the Society presented proposals to the State proposing to connect the Atlantic seaboard with Lake Erie. This Pennsylvania plan was before the creation of New York's Western and Northern Inland Lock Navigation Companies in 1792. The New York plan took the first steps to improve navigation on the Mohawk river by constructing a canal between the Mohawk and Lake OntarioCalhoun, Daniel Hovey.

In the Pennsylvania plan, the Society proposed a canal route, 426 miles in length connecting Philadelphia with Pittsburgh by a canal. One part of this project was a canal segment up to the Schuylkill River to Tulpehocken Creek to a summit-level canal near Lebanon and thence by way of the Quitapahilla and Swatara creeks to the Susquehanna River. This action resulted in the formation of two companies The first was the Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation Company incorporated on September 29, 1791,Mitchell, James Tyndale, et al.

This 1791 act required the company to pay all damages resulting from its use of eminent domain authority to take all lands (improved or unimproved), water, and materials necessary for construction and operating the canal including mills, mill ponds, water and water courses. This caused many canal companies such as the Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation Company great concern over the amount of damages awarded in these procedures. Charles G. Paleske, an officer of the company stated in 1807 that \\"...the company could not complete the largest branch of its canal because, among other reasons, of \\"the enormous sums paid for land and water rights.\\" Organizing the Company In early 1792, the company was organized in Philadelphia with noted financier and land speculator Robert Morris as president,Tench Francis as Treasurer and noted engrosser of the declaration of independence Timothy Matlack as Secretary.

In recruiting stock subscriptions, the Commissioners were required to advertise in three newspapers for a month with one being in the German language. They were authorized to sell one thousand shares and if the stock was oversubscribed, a lottery was to be used to apportion the sales, no one person was to initially own more than ten shares. Financing the Company At the time that Robert Morris and the others were organizing the company \\"(p)oor harvests in Europe brought unprecedented agricultural and commercial prosperity to the Delaware Valley.\\"Doerflinger, Thomas M.. A Vigorous Spirit of Enterprise: Merchants and Economic Development in Revolutionary Philadelphia, University of North Carolina Press, 2012. One of the administration's first official acts as part of Hamilton's economic plan was to \\"...pour thousands of dollars into the pockets of prescient speculators by funding depreciated American bonds at 100 percent of their face value. The resulting ebullience in the investment markets facilitated the flotation of a series of new companies ...\\" such as Morris' Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation company. While post-revolutionary grain exports from Philadelphia had stagnated through 1788, the Continental subsistence crisis created a demand for American grain that Philadelphia rushed to fill. Beyond the Delaware valley lay the vast Susquehanna river valley, this increase for Philadelphia exports had occurred despite the gains made by Baltimore in shifting trade to its ports.BJORK, GORDON C. Stagnation And Growth In The American Economy, 1784-1792, University of Washington, Ann Arbor, 1963. ProQuest \\"...the essential economic function of Philadelphia's merchant community was to link the city's hinterland with its overseas markets.

Stancliffe. (1917). Essays in the earlier history of American corporations. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. Accessed on July 25, 2018 at This was acclaimed \\"another instance of the public spirit of the inhabitants of this state,\\" though in reality it testifies chiefly to the speculative spirit then running riot. The subscriptions were reduced by lottery to one thousand shares, and canal scrip was soon selling at an advance. Several months later, the first financial panic in the new United States occurred, the panic of 1792. This impacted the availability of cash for subscribers to fulfill their obligations from the previous December and the Company agreed to take notes in lieu of cash. This process of financing the navigation company was managed by Morris in the same time period as large swaths of Northern Pennsylvania were being developed by the managers of the company.Wilkinson, Norman B. \\"The\\" Philadelphia Fever\\" in Northern Pennsylvania.\\" Pennsylvania History: A Journal of Mid-Atlantic Studies 20.1 (1953): 40-56. The fundamental problem was that speculators such as Robert Morris had too much credit. Often using the land to which \\"...they had only preliminary claim, either selling, encumbering them with mortgages or using them as collateral for loans.\\" The Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation company prospectus promised greater trade and settlement, thus raising the value of the lands. In addition to the two navigation companies, Robert Morris, and other managers \\"...established no less than six companies of this type between 1793 and 1797.\\" These were the Pennsylvania Population Company, Asylum Land Company, North American Land Company, Territorial Land Company, Pennsylvania Land Company, Pennsylvania Property Company. This speculative bubble burst in 1796 just when the navigation company was trying to mobilize the financing for its operations. Engineering the canal There were very few trained civil engineers in the new United States when the company was chartered.Kirby, Richard Shelton. \\"William Weston and his contribution to early American engineering.\\" Transactions of the Newcomen Society 16.1 (1935): 111-127. The earlier planning for locating the canal commissioned by the Society up through 1791 had been performed by members such as John Lukens, surveyor general of Pennsylvania and the eminent American astronomer and surveyor, David Rittenhouse. Other than Brindley (1745-1820), no one had any experience with canal location or lockage. The original engineering concept developed by the Society as well as the navigation company's charter had been to build a canal up the \\"...Schuylkill valley to Norristown, and improving the river from there to Reading; while from Reading a canal was to extend to the Susquehanna, via Lebanon.\\" This would have made the Schuylkill and Susquehanna canal the first summit-level canal in the United States. A four- mile summit crossing between Tulpehocken and the Quitipahilla would be an artificial waterway connecting two separate river valleys; namely the Susquehanna and the Schuylkill watersheds. The term refers to a canal that rises then falls, as opposed to a lateral canal, which has a continuous fall only. In this case, the proposed canal at 80 miles in length would rise 192 feet over 42 miles from the west at the Susquehanna river to the summit and then fall 311 feet over 34 miles to the Schuylkill river to the east.Tanner, Henry Schenck, 1786-1858, A description of the canals and railroads of the United States, comprehending notices of all the works of internal improvement throughout the several states. Accessed on August 31, 2018 at Unfortunately, most of the four-mile summit crossing was underlain by the Ontelaunee Formation, a \\"...dark grayish-brown weathering dolomite ...\\" or carbonate bedrock.Ousey Jr, John R., Ruth Egan, and William Maun. \\"Geologic and Hydrologic Problems Encountered in the Construction and Operation of the Union Canal in Pennsylvania\\", Journal of the Pennsylvania Academy of Science (1998): 90-95. Accessed using JSTOR subscription. Other equally important parts of the summit crossing were constructed through the Annville Formation, a \\"...very thick bedded, finely crystalline, light blue-gray to light pinkish-gray, high- calcium limestone.\\" Crucially, that meant the summit traversed highly soluble bedrock with poor surface drainage and where sinkholes were common. Ultimately, the 1794 engineering concept was flawed. The water supply for the summit crossing was inadequate. While the 1794 construction was never \\"watered\\", its successor, the Union canal was faced with the choice of either \\"puddling\\" (packing low-permeability clay on the bottom and sides), or \\"planking\\" (lining the sides and bottom of the canal with wood planks) for the summit crossing in order to conserve water supplies. In the end, \\"planking\\" was chosen which required \\"...close to 2,000,000 board-feet of lumber ...\\" to seal the crossing. Even with two reservoirs constructed at the summit as feeders to the canal, the Union canal required pumped water from a waterworks at the junction of Swatara Creek and Clarke's run and later from a second waterworks on Furnace Creek on the Quitipahilla. At the first works, there were four pumps with the capacity to lift about \\"...15,000 gallons per minute through 3.3 miles of wooden and brick pipes to the summit level, 95 feet above the pumps ...\\" Of the four pumps only two could be powered by water, the other two had to be powered by Cornish steam engines, a technology available in 1828 when the canal opened but not in 1791.Nuvolari, Alessandro; Verspagen, Bart (2009). \\"Technical choice, innovation and British steam engineering, 1800-1850\\". Economic History Review. 63 (3): 685‚Äì710. by 1885, the Union canal was sold at a sheriff sale, \\"unable to cope with ... (competition from) ... the railroads, poor planning, and the carbonate bedrock of Lebanon County, Pennsylvania. Had the Schuylkill and Susquehanna navigation company been successful in completing the canal in 1794-95, it probably would have succumbed to same poor planning and summit geology as its successor did. =James Brindley, canal engineer (1791-1792)= While the navigation company was being organized in 1791, the Society asked Brindley to re-evaluate the summit level crossing Between Lebanon, Pennsylvania and Myerstown. Brindley was to reexamine the topography of the summit and produce a detailed location for the canal. He was also to ensure that the local supply of water was adequate to supply the amount of water necessary to operate the locks on both sides of the summit; critical for the success of the project, as well as to make an estimate of the \\"...lands and waters necessary ...\\" for the work. Brindley completed the work that summer,yet, Morris still agreed with George Washington's earlier assessment that although Brindley had \\"more practical knowledge of cuts and locks for the improvement of inland navigation than any man among us ...\\" in Morris' mind, Brindley's skills remained unproven. Nonetheless, the Navigation company hired Brindley in April 1792 for the construction season work as canal engineer along with Col. Thomas Bull (1744-1837) as Superintendent. In May, the Board of Directors with Brindley tour the summit crossing between the Quitapahilla and Tulpehocken Creeks as well as the waters to the north, including the Deep Run Branch of the Little Swatara. From west to east, the route was to follow Swatara Creek upstream from Middletown to Quittapahilla Creek, which it then followed upstream through Lebanon and towards Myerstown. It then crossed overland to the headwaters of Tulpehocken Creek, following Tulpehocken Creek downstream to Reading on the Schuylkill River. It was to follow the Schuylkill downriver to the Delaware River at Philadelphia. The summit route was fixed by the Board between Kuchner's dam on the Quittapahilla and Loy's springs on the Tulpehocken west of Myerstown.Augunst, Dean (1966). Two Canals of Lebanon County. Papers and addresses of the Lebanon County Historical Society, Volume 65, issue 1, pages 1-30 In August of that year,1792, the company approves Brindley's engineering concept for crossing the summit. It was to be a twenty- five deep cut, thirty-feet wide at the bottom and watered to a depth of four feet. Based solely upon Brindley's work and before their new British engineer, Weston could review the scheme, in October 1792, the Board authorized Superintendent Bull to purchase a strip of land 100 feet wide for the canal route to the Swatara. In November,1792 the company purchases the mill of Baltzer Orth on the head of the Quittapahilla Creek for ¬£4,250 and two tracts of Abraham Crow for ¬£2,600. Superintendent Bull and Timothy Matlack begin construction staking for the summit canal using Brindley's route. The work is met with resistance from the local residents who \\"resent the intrusion of rich Philadelphians into their entirely German community and having their farms cut up ...\\" The local residents protested the exercise of eminent domain by the company in cutting up farms to build a straight and regular, rather than a traditional meandering and undulating road or canal. =William Weston, canal engineer and superintendent (1792-1794)= During the time that Brindley acting as canal engineer, the company approached Patrick Colquhoun in London to recruit what the company considered to be a more qualified British engineer for the canal. In January 1792, Colquhoun initially tried to recruit John Dadford but he was unavailable. Colquhoun then approached the eminent British civil engineer William Jessop to select \\"...a properly qualified engineer for North America, he recommended Weston.\\" Colquhoun was finally able to secure the services William Weston twenty-nine years old at the time building at that time canals in Ireland. Weston signed a contract drafted by Colquhoun for his services to the company as its \\"engineer\\" with the annual salary of ¬£800 in 1792 for no more than seven months in any one year worth $120,000 US in 2018.Pounds Sterling to Dollars: Historical Conversion of Currency accessed at on July 13, 2018 At the time that Weston traveled over to the new country of the United States, ... Almost immediately upon his arrival in Pennsylvania, the company attempted to renegotiate Weston's compensation to cover twelve months instead of seven, offering to raise it to ¬£1,500 ($225,000 US in 2018) and increasing the geographical scope of his services to include the states of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and Delaware. =Lock navigation versus a water-level channel= Although the Board had authorized work for the summit crossing, there still was a question in their minds as of September 1792 over staying with their original concept of river navigation for improving the Tulpehocken and Quitapahilla and Swatara or to go for lock system navigation. The Board had also been faced with two routes across the summit and onto the Swatara using either the Quitapahilla to the south or Clark's run to the north. An 1816 map of Lebanon County Pennsylvania showing 1794 Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation company summit crossing construction. The construction is highlighted in red. Constructing the canal (1792-1794)  The company was pursuing several construction projects during a time in which skilled labor was in short supply and very costly. The presence of several projects could easily drive up labor and material costs. Much as in the twentieth century where project labor agreements are used to predetermine wages and working conditions, these eighteenth-century project managers sought to negotiate cooperative agreements with other projects to constrain the growth in wages and control working conditions. In October 1792, the Board of Directors appointed a committee to \\"... confer with the Delaware & Schuylkill Canal and Philadelphia & Lancaster Turnpike Road on sending a joint agent to New England to recruit labor.\\" The next month the Board directs superintendent Bull to limit wages to 3s6d (70 cents) per day with the company providing tools and provisions. More importantly, the Board also directs Bull to negotiate \\"... an agreement with the Delaware & Schuylkill Canal and the Philadelphia & Lancaster Turnpike Road to observe a uniform ceiling on the wages to be offered.\\" The practice even went so far as have the Boards of several companies meet as a joint committee. Thus in November 1792, the Schuylkill & Susquehanna, Delaware & Schuylkill, and Conewago Canals and Philadelphia & Lancaster Turnpike Road met as a joint committee and \\"... named Isaac Roberdeau (1763-1829), who had worked under Pierre C. L'Enfant on laying out Washington, D.C. and Paterson, N.J., is named agent of all three companies at $120 per month; he later becomes William Weston's assistant.\\" The joint committee also agreed to \\"... cooperate with each other and with local employers of day laborers so as not to increase wages by bidding against each other; workers imported from New England are to be excepted.\\" The Joint committee continued to make plans for a coordinated effort over the winter of 1792-1793 to \\"procure laborers in New England, 400 for each of the main canals, 150 for the Conewago Canal, and 200 for the turnpike, also 10 yokes of oxen, carts, and drivers for the turnpike; maximum wage rates and working conditions were established for moving expenses and the use of company teams.\\" The Committee also directed that all member companies were to sell provisions to the men at cost. The labor force was being mobilized in Philadelphia to start the construction season on March 10, 1793. The following January of 1793, the Company reported that \\"... 80 to 100 men are at work and about a half-mile of the canal has been dug; are working on the summit level on land purchased by John Nicholson from Jacob Schaffer.\\" Brindley's design concept for the summit crossing was a cut twenty-five deep, thirty-feet wide at the bottom and watered to a depth of four feet. Brindley had assumed that the cut would entirely excavate earth instead they \\"... struck rock at a depth of 9 feet.\\" The next month, roughly 400 men are working on the Tulpehocken Creek side of the summit. Engineer Weston reviews Brindley's plans for the summit crossing including Brindley's scheme for supplying the summit with water. Weston changes the design to twenty feet from thirty feet but increases the depth from four to six feet of water, acting as a reservoir. By March, 1793, the company has exhausted its project funding and has accumulated $56,000 in liabilities ($1.5 million (US)-2018$s). In April, the Conewago Canal is incorporated as a separate company with James Brindley as chief engineer. That same month the Company Board directs engineer Weston to \\"make the Tulpehocken side of the summit the priority ...\\" as well to develop more sources of water to supply the summit crossing. During the same period, the company moved to acquire right of way on the Tulpehocken creekside by legally enforcing its eminent domain rights. However the effort was met with \\"a large force . ... armed with clubs who oppose (seizing the land) ... in the meantime, landowners refuse to allow entry onto their land.\\" The pace of construction slowed and in that summer of 1793, Superintendent Bull resigned. The company arranges for some interim financing in the form of a $4,000 loan from Major Edward Burd. That summer was also notable for the first yellow fever epidemic in 30 years began in the city of Philadelphia in August, 1793.Mark A. Smith, \\"Andrew Brown's 'Earnest Endeavor': The Federal Gazette 's Role in Philadelphia's Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1793\\", The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography, Vol. 120, No. 4 (Oct., 1996), pp. 321‚Äì342, accessed 28 March 2012 It was one of the most severe epidemics in the United States. At the height of the panic from the epidemic in late August 1793, the Company closed its offices, and they would remain closed through November of that year. This crippled the company's ability to raise additional funding for construction. 1889 USGS Lebanon County map showing topography of summit crossing between Lebanon and Myerstown, Pennsylvania.

The next day he traveled to Reading, Pennsylvania on his way to meet up with the rest of the militia he ordered mobilized at Carlisle. On the second of October, 1794, Washington left Reading heading west to Womelsdorf in order to \\"view the canal from Myerstown towards Lebanon and the locks between the two places ...\\". Another officer on the march noted that at that time, ten miles of canal had been excavated and five locks constructed for a total lift of thirty feet in elevation. Suspension of work on the canal (1794-1796) By the end of the year (1793), Weston reported to the Board that \\"... lawsuits and jury awards have slowed the work. ... \\" While Weston had over four hundred men working on the project that summer, by the end of the year, most of his workforce had left the project. The remaining workforce was assigned to work on the towpath. In the end, Weston had completed 4.25 miles of the canal prism through the narrows between the two springs. Weston, though had to narrow the summit cut to pass only one boat at a time. Crucially, Weston had also to acknowledge a problem that none of his predecessors had faced when he was forced to \\"... line both sides of the canal with drywall stones to reduce leakage.\\" Going into 1794, Weston estimated that he needed $231,000 ($4.9 million in 2018$s) for the years work requiring the company to raise another $120 thousand in capital. The company was unable to raise the capital or borrow the money and on May 3, 1794, it reported that its funds were exhausted. However, the company continued to make attempts to raise funds for the project, and in December 1794, Chief engineer Weston reported on the state of the project. :\\"William Weston issues his last report on Schuylkill & Susquehanna Navigation; notes that ¬£8,526 has been spent on 4 miles and 16¬Ω chains of canal between Kreitzer's and the east end of the summit level, five locks and two bridges completed, and sixth lock and two more bridges nearly done.\\" Funds are still insufficient and the Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation company in the close of 1794 makes its final payroll and informs Weston that in the future he is solely an employee of the Delaware and Schuylkill Canal company. The company's efforts were futile as no additional funds were secured. Finally, in April 1795, the Board authorizes Weston \\"to sell the company's teams and send the rest to Philadelphia for sale; the company's stock of black powder is to be sent to Norristown for the use of the Delaware & Schuylkill Canal; Weston appoints seven men to take care of the works, which are effectively abandoned and never brought into use.\\" In the spring of 1796, the Board orders the disposal of all the bricks Weston had manufactured for construction of the canal's locks effectively terminating the project. =Support for other canal projects (1795-1796)= As the navigation company exhausted its funding by early 1795, in May of that year the Board terminated Weston's employment contract with the Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation company. Weston though was still was obligated to work with the Delaware and Schuylkill Canal company. By the spring of 1796, Weston reported that six miles of canal had been completed, three at each side but that due to lack of funds, the work had been terminated. The Board for the canal company also terminated Weston's employment contract that spring. Weston went on to work with Gen. Phillip Schuyler for Western Inland Lock Navigation Company for 4 years. During this period, Benjamin Wright (1770-1842) who was later to become Chief Engineer of the Erie Canal and other projects, worked under Weston. Merger and remobilization as the Union Canal Company of Pennsylvania (1800-1811) Despite the termination of construction and Weston's employment as canal engineer the company managed to forestall foreclosure on its property and constructed works.Baer, Christopher T. \\"A General Chronology of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company Predecessors and Successors and its Historical Context.\\" (For the period of 1800-1809)- Archived from the original on (2007), updated May 2015.Accessed at on August 30, 2018. In 1802, the company had to fend off such an attempt and was only successful in holding onto its property and water rights through the sale of excess property, often whole farms were sold. Although originally set to expire in 1801, the company's corporate charter was extended in 1806 to 1820. In 1807, Charles Gottfried Paleske (1758-1816) was elected to the Board of Directors of the company and working with James Milnor, Robert Brooke, Isaac Roberdeau, and John Scott walked \\"... the line of the Schuylkill & Susquehanna Navigation Company from Kruitzer's plantation where the canal ends to the end of the summit near Kucher's mill, about 9 miles; find the work in good condition including the five locks at Ley's, and the bridges decayed or collapsed ...\\" In 1808, Paleske was elected President and Joseph S. Lewis (1778-1836) treasurer. In 1809, the company's directors appointed a committee to draft articles for a merger with the Delaware and Schuylkill Canal company which was submitted to the State legislature. In 1810, William John Duane (1780-1865) writing as \\"Franklin\\" advocates for reviving the Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation company as part of a scheme for a canal route to Lake Erie instead of the Ohio Valley.Baer, Christopher T. \\"A General Chronology of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company Predecessors and Successors and its Historical Context.\\" (For the period of 1810-1814)- Archived from the original on (2007), updated May 2015.Accessed at on August 30, 2018. In July,1811, the two corporations (Schuylkill & Susquehanna Navigation Company and Delaware and Schuylkill Canal company) were merged into the Union Canal Company with Paleske as its first president and \\"...authorized to extend to Lake Erie and to build turnpikes along right of way; company is also given monopoly of lotteries in Pennsylvania until $400,000 is raised ...\\"  Legacy and Impact One of George Washington's Washington's observations was that ... :\\"...men look towards the direction from which their rivers flow. The settlement of the trans-Allegheny region during the eighteenth century had impressed this fact upon his mind to such an extent that the construction of artificial waterways between the East and the West became one of his most abiding concerns. He saw clearly that our political union, as well as our economic welfare, depended upon the creation of trade relations between the two sections, and the only way of establishing such relation at that time was by improvement of river- beds and construction of canals.\\"Meyer, Balthasar Henry, and Caroline Elizabeth MacGill. History of Transportation in the United States before 1860. Washington: Carnegie Institution of Washington, 1917. Although some road projects had been completed by several states, ... :\\" (E)ven the best turnpike system failed to ... (adequately serve communities) separated from one another by 200 or 300 miles. The cost of transporting one ton of freight for one mile over a turnpike road averaged 13 cents, or $13 per 100 miles, whereas the cost of water transportation was less than one twenty-fifth of this charge.\\" The situation was such that it cheaper in that period (1789) to import \\" :\\"a ton of goods was frequently brought from Europe, a distance of 3,000 miles, for about $9, and that this rate admitted the importation of salt, coal, stone, lumber, iron, and other bulky articles from beyond the seas for less than it cost to carry the same articles upon a good road for 30 miles. This claim was well supported by facts. Several forges were operated in Lancaster County (Pennsylvania) along the Lebanon Hills before the Revolution, but these supplied only local needs prior to the completion of water communication with the seaport cities, because the cost of wagon transportation for the distance of 75 miles was more than twice the amount charged for transporting the same amount across the Atlantic.\\" (See also Duane 1819)  The golden link  During this same period (1789-1820), the focus of Philadelphia mercantile interests was central Pennsylvania and its vast Susquehanna watershed draining two-thirds of Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania however, was so situated physiographically that most of its trade was carried out of the State away from its chief city and the Federal capital, Philadelphia by its two rivals; Baltimore at the base of the Susquehanna system and Albany on the north. It was estimated that half of the produce shipped down the Susquehanna river ultimately went to Baltimore, not Philadelphia. Throughout this period, it was argued by men such as Samuel Breck and William Duane that connecting the Schuylkill and Susquehanna rivers would solve all these problems and assure Philadelphia that its trade would be secured and enlarged.Duane, William John. Observations on the importance of improving the navigation of the River Schuylkill for the purpose of connecting it with the Susquehanna, and through that river extending our communication to the Genesee Lakes and the Ohio. N.p., [1818?]. Breck also advocated for improving the Schuylkill river, but he noted that ... :\\"The Schuylkill, it is now taken for granted, will be soon rendered navigable, even for steamboats. This is an important link in the great western and northern chains; but the golden link-‚Äîthe essential and high connecting part of that series of water-route, which is to convey so much wealth to Philadelphia, lies between Reading and Middletown. If we make a good channel using the waters of the Tulpehocken, which empty into the Schuylkill, and those of the Swatara, which empty into the Susquehanna, and thus reach that great river, we are (forever) safe, as a town\\"Breck, Samuel. Sketch of the Internal Improvements Already Made by Pennsylvania: With Observations Upon Her Physical and Fiscal Means for Their Extension; Particularly as They Have Reference to the Future Growth and Prosperity of Philadelphia. M. Thomas, 1818. The linchpin of this whole strategy rested on the \\"golden link\\" between the Schuylkill and the Susquehanna rivers, the Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation Company History of the canal system of the State of New York together with brief histories of the canals of the United States and Canada, Noble E. Whitford. 1905 Accessed at HathiTrust on July 19, 2018 with its summit level crossing at Lebanon, Pennsylvania.  A dismal failure  The State response to this advocacy varied. Only in 1791, was it able to mobilize some legislation and little funding in three areas; river navigation, turnpike roads, and corporate canals. As the later experience would show with the Lebanon summit canal project, these ... :\\"...navigation acts on the earlier pattern which amounted to very little and which, if anything, only brought to light the deceptive premise on which the memorialists too largely based their hopes, for river improvements could seldom be adapted advantageously to the water-courses of the state. Those of Josiah White and his associates on the Lehigh were an outstanding exception to usual experience.\\" The turnpike roads such as the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike Road Company of 1792 were more successful, albeit costly, solution of reaching the Susquehanna river at Columbia. Corporate canals, (state-aided joint-stock company) such as the Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation Company even when fostered and subsidized like turnpike companies, \\"... were a dismal failure, nothing material being accomplished in this field until about 1821 ... and its eventual shortcomings as an improvement agency were one of several considerations that pointed the way to state enterprise.\\" With such enthusiasm prevailing at that time (1789-1820), the Chief Engineer for the Erie canal later wrote in 1905 that it didn't seem at all \\"...impossible that Pennsylvania, had it not been for the Erie canal; would have succeeded ultimately in overcoming natural difficulties and piercing the mountain barrier ... to secure ... the commercial prestige which the (Erie) canal ... captured for New York State.\\" The result of the failure of the Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation Company was that in 1795 with the Erie canal thirty years into the future, Philadelphia lost \\"...the early initiative in water transportation..\\" Despite Philadelphia and Pennsylvania's \\"heroic efforts\\" to hold their share of the internal trade which in 1796 was forty percent more than New York; by 1825 with the opening of the Erie canal, Philadelphia's trade was forty-five percent less than New York.  Philadelphia as the American Metropolis  Philadelphia's dismal failure to build the \\"golden link\\" thirty years before New York opened the Erie canal was a major factor in that slide into second place.

The organization works to represent and advocate for secondary school students in Canada and was formed in response to the Putting Students First Act (formerly Bill 115) on September 11, 2012 though was not formally incorporated until December 24, 2014.  History  Prior to October 2015, the FCSS-FESC was formerly known as the Organization of Ontario Secondary Students (OOSS) and carried out the work of advocating for students in the province of Ontario. The organization formally amended its registered name with the Government of Canada on October 26, 2016 and opened new chapters in the provinces of British Columbia, Quebec, and Alberta to help further student voice and awareness of student issues in new regions across Canada.  The FCSS-FESC and Bill 115  From the outset of the labour dispute between educators and their union, the ministry of education, and boards of education the FCSS-FESC affirmed a fully non-partisan, non- political stance and stated that it would take no sides and give no favour to any party of the dispute, while also hoping to \\"affect the negotiations between the union and the government in some way or form.\\" While many students orchestrated walkouts at schools across the province, the FCSS-FESC discouraged its members and other students from participating in these protest actions, and instead proposed a vision for a \\"unified student voice\\" for the province in labour negotiations. As a result of the looming employment action and risk of strikes by teachers and educational staff caused by Bill 115, the Organization of Ontario Secondary Students launched a two-fold protest plan that would see secondary students engage in a group petition action that would be sent to the provincial ministry of education and the Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation (OSSTF), the union representing secondary teachers. The second portion of the protest action would have students sign placards asserting the importance of extra-curricular activities which would then be sent to then Minister of Education Laurel Broten and President of the OSSTF, Ken Coran. As the dispute between the provincial Ministry of Education, secondary school teachers (via their union), and public school board continued into 2013, the Organization of Ontario Secondary Students launched a province- wide initiative called \\"Sport Your Extra-Curricular Day\\" which encouraged secondary students from across Ontario to wear their official school spirit attire to support the reinstatement of extra-curricular activities in Ontario schools. The event was organized completely by secondary students from Abbey Park High School but later spread to over 40 schools in the province. Throughout the protests, the FCSS-FESC asserted that its goal was \\"not to wreak havoc on the union or the government, but to send a distinctive message that advocates the student voice and publicizes the devastating impact this conflict has had on Ontario students.\\" Dennis Xu, then President of the FCSS- FESC also spoke about the importance of extra-curricular activities on the Metro Morning show by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) to help raise awareness of the ongoing labour dispute and to publicize the non- disruptive protest action organized by the organization. In early February 2013, Katie Fettes of the FCSS-FESC engaged in a two-hour meeting with the President of the OSSTF, Ken Coran. The meeting was held in an attempt to reconcile the reasons for why teachers were withholding extra-curricular activities. Fettes further emphasized that \\"the school culture is missing,\\" before continuing to describe the hostility felt by students against teachers. As in-school extra-curricular activities were planned to be reintroduced in March 2013, the FCSS-FESC launched Operation Save Our Schools to draw attention to the arbitration model to prevent future labour disputes from affecting the learning environment for students and to help educate the public on the importance of extra-curricular activities in schools as a vital part of secondary education. The operation involved a consultation with students across the province and the drafting of an open letter to the provincial government to outline the importance of extra-curricular activities and the need for an arbitration model.  Advocacy After Bill 115  After the labour dispute in 2012 as a result of Bill 115, the FCSS-FESC later responded to further potential strike action by secondary school educators in 2015 which could disrupt the delivery of marks at year-end, field trips, sports events, and proms for students. The organization sent written correspondence to the Durham District School Board which was one of the seven municipal boards of education at risk of teacher walkouts, as well as the OSSTF. As before, the FCSS-FESC proposed non-disruptive protest action and advocated that the goal was \\"to get the student voice heard\\" by writing letters to members of provincial parliament, the minister of education, and other stakeholders in the education system. In early April, the FCSS-FESC hosted a youth outreach workshop entitled the \\"Opportunities Fair\\" which hoped to connect passionate secondary students in search of volunteer experience with worthy and youth- focused nonprofit organizations such as AYJ Global, YMCA, Evergreen, YES Canada, Operation Dentistry School, SHAD, HOSA, YBH, Project 5K, Wirkn, and Plan Canada. On August 20, 2015, the Organization of Ontario Secondary Students was invited to participate on the CBC Ontario Today show to discuss the changing nature of education and what students believe should be different about school with specific regard to labour unrest, Ontario's new sexual education curriculum, and protests over dress codes. In the 2016-2017 year, the FCSS-FESC launched a new initiative focused on establishing a set of fundamental rights for students across Canada. Known as the Student Bill of Rights, the FCSS-FESC engaged in multiple consultations and meetings with relevant parties to refine and produce the Bill, and is in the process of discussing recognition and areas of improvements with the Ontario Ministry of Education. As of the 2017-2018 year, operations with the Student Bill of Rights have expanded to British Columbia, with consultations beginning there.  Canadian Charter of Learners' Rights (CCLR)  The Canadian Charter of Learners‚Äô Rights (CCLR) was created by the CCLR committee, formerly known as the SBOR, within FCSS-FESC. This document outlines the five most essential rights of Canadian students in the areas of fundamental, accessibility, equality, fair standards, and utility rights. In February 2020, with the endorsement of MPP Peggy Sattler, the CCLR was presented at a Queens Park press conference.  Elevate  Elevate is an FCSS-FESC Programme that focuses on recognizing issues affecting student mental health and providing resources to help students tackle them. On April 7, 2018, Elevate hosted a Mental Wellness Seminar at the Albert McCormick Community Centre.

The attack was intended to minimize interference from the Far East Air Force (FEAF) during the subsequent invasion of the Philippines by the Empire of Japan. Capture of the Philippines was essential to control shipping routes between Japan and the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Hostilities were initiated by the attack on Pearl Harbor at 07:48 Hawaiian Time (UTC-10) on 7 December 1941. As dawn moved westward across the Pacific (and the International Date Line), daylight airstrikes followed at mid-day (UTC+12) on Wake Island, at 09:27 (UTC+10) on Guam, at 06:00 (UTC+8) on Davao, at 09:30 (UTC+8) on Baguio and at 12:35 (UTC+8) on Clark Field. United States Army Air Forces aircraft losses on the ground in the Philippines were similar to those sustained on Oahu despite nine hours available for preparations following the Pearl Harbor attack; but commanding general Douglas MacArthur avoided the disgrace suffered by Hawaiian commanding general Walter Short. Manila Manila was the United States forward military base in the Pacific, with strategic significance comparable to Singapore for the British Empire. Lieutenant General Douglas MacArthur commanded United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE) from headquarters in Manila. MacArthur's command included ground forces and the FEAF. Clark Field was the primary air base for the bombers expected to provide offensive airstrike capability under the Rainbow 5 war plan. Fighter aircraft expected to provide defensive cover could use Clark Field or satellite airfields including Nichols Field and Nielson Field to the southeast, Iba Airfield to the west, and Del Carmen Airfield to the south. FEAF also protected Naval Base Cavite serving as the home port for the cruisers, destroyers, submarines, and flying boats of the Asiatic Fleet. Far East Air Force FEAF with headquarters at Neilson Field was under the command of Major General Lewis H. Brereton, who was required to report to MacArthur through MacArthur's chief of staff, Brigadier General Richard K. Sutherland. At the time of the attack, FEAF had more planes than the Hawaiian Department protecting Pearl Harbor. The fleet of 35 Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers was the largest number assigned to any army air force. Clark Field was the primary base for the B-17s, where these heavy planes were stored without camouflage on ramps lest they become mired in the undrained soft soil surrounding those graded surfaces. B-17s could also use Del Monte Airfield in southern Mindanao where military personnel lived and worked in tents on a pineapple plantation. Aircraft at Del Monte were beyond the range of land- based Japanese bombers, but were similarly unable to reach Japanese targets. In addition to the B-17s, FEAF aircraft inventory on 8 December included 107 Curtiss P-40 Warhawk fighters, 26 Seversky P-35 fighters, 18 Douglas B-18 Bolo bombers, 12 Boeing P-26 Peashooter fighters, 11 Curtiss O-52 Owl observation planes, 2 Douglas O-46 observation planes, 8 North American A-27 ground attack aircraft, and 3 Martin B-10 bombers. Events of 8 December 1941 Local time chronology (UTC+8): * 02:40 - Asiatic Fleet Headquarters received notification of the Pearl Harbor attack but did not inform MacArthur. * 03:40 - Sutherland heard a commercial radio broadcast with news of the Pearl Harbor attack, and notified MacArthur. * 04:00 - Sutherland notified FEAF headquarters of the Pearl Harbor attack. * 05:00 - Sutherland refused Brereton's request to launch a B-17 raid on Formosa from Clark shortly after daylight. They agreed to prepare for a mission preceded by a photoreconnaissance mission, but to await MacArthur's permission for the offensive operations. * 05:30 - A War Department message reached MacArthur's headquarters confirming war status with Japan requiring Rainbow 5 plan air raids against Japanese targets within range of the Philippines. * 06:15 - MacArthur's staff received notification of Japanese aircraft attack on Davao Field, Mindanao. * 07:15 - Sutherland refused to allow Brereton to speak with MacArthur and directed him to await orders. * 08:00 - General Henry H. Arnold called from Washington, D.C. warning Brereton not to let his planes be attacked on the ground. * 08:30 - Brereton launched three squadron-sized fighter patrols and all serviceable B-17s from Clark Field went aloft in a holding pattern. * 08:50 - Brereton called Sutherland requesting permission to launch a raid on Formosa and was told to wait. * 09:25 - Japanese 5th Air Group bombers from Formosa bombed Tuguegarao Field and USAFFE summer headquarters at Baguio. Brereton telephoned Sutherland, and was refused permission to launch an offensive airstrike. * 09:30 - 11th Air Fleet of 26 Mitsubishi G3M bombers, 82 Mitsubishi G4M bombers and 84 Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters took off from Formosa. * 09:40 - Sutherland gave Brereton authorization to launch the photoreconnaissance mission. * 10:14 - MacArthur gave Brereton authorization for an air strike. * 10:30 - Planes launched at 08:30 landed to be refueled. * 10:45 - Brereton orders the B-17s landing at Clark Field to be armed with and bombs anticipating launch at 14:00 for an attack on southern Formosa airfields at dusk. * 11:30 - Iba Field RADAR detected the incoming 11th Air Fleet out. * 11:45 - Iba Field and Clark Field begin launching fighters to intercept the raid. * 12:00 - Clark Field received warning of the approaching airstrike. * 12:10 - Cameras for the photoreconnaissance mission arrived at Clark to be loaded aboard B-17s. * 12:35 - Clark Field was launching reserve fighters as 11th Air Fleet began an hour-long bombing and strafing of Clark Field and Iba Field. Air raid At 12:35 a horizontal bombing run at by 26 Mitsubishi G3M bombers and 27 Mitsubishi G4M bombers released 636 bombs over Clark Field. These planes were above the range of Clark Field anti-aircraft guns. As the bombers departed 34 Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters strafed undamaged planes on the ground at Clark Field. Seven minutes later, 53 Mitsubishi G4M bombers dropped 486 bombs and 26 bombs on Iba Field, followed by 51 strafing Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters. Destruction at Iba Field was so complete the Zeros flew on to Clark Field to find targets for their remaining ammunition. Results Of the seventeen B-17s on the ground at Clark Field, twelve were destroyed, four were damaged, and one escaped damage. Two evaded damage while on reconnaissance missions and returned after the raid. Eleven B-17s had been flown to Mindanao before the raid, and five more reached there on the day of the attack. The P-40 fighters aloft were unable to reach the altitude of the Japanese bombers, and suffered a poor exchange rate in low-altitude combat with strafing Zero fighters. Thirty-four P-40s were destroyed on the ground or in aerial combat. Older P-35 and P-26 fighters were obsolete for air-to-air combat, but were used for training, and might have been useful for observation and ground attack had they survived until the invasion. Aftermath United States Army Air Forces commanding general Henry H. Arnold called Brereton that afternoon to ask \\"how the hell\\" he was caught by surprise nine hours after receiving news of the Pearl Harbor attack. Walter Short was relieved of command of the Hawaiian Department on 17 December by Army chief of staff general George C. Marshall, who took no similar action against MacArthur despite remarking to a reporter a few days later: \\"I just don't know how MacArthur happened to let his planes get caught on the ground.\\" References World War II aerial operations and battles of the Pacific theatre Airstrikes conducted by Japan History of Pampanga December 1941 events ","title":"Attack on Clark Field"},{"id":"51207188","text":"New Introductory Lectures on the System of Transcendental Qabala is the first studio album of Kel Valhaal, an electronic music focused project of Liturgy vocalist and guitarist Hunter Hunt-Hendrix. It was released on Hunt-Hendrix's label YLYLCYN on July 15, 2016. Ideas for Kel Valhaal were created in 2010 as a rap project. However, Hunt-Hendrix's practice in making electronic music while touring with Liturgy led the project to be an electronic act, though her rapping is still present on the record in her trademark vocal style. Her intent of making music under the moniker Kel Valhaal is to create a complex spiritual mythology set to music; supposedly emulating what has been called \\"transcendental catharsis\\". The titular character of the project is described as a \\"logical agency of faith and acephalic becoming\\", with the name derived from Liturgy's third studio album The Ark Work. Background and composition The press release for New Introductory Lectures on the System of Transcendental Qabala described the Kel Valhaal project as quieter, \\"less finely wrought\\" and containing \\"more frequent and shorter releases, more variation, less consistency\\" and \\"more experimentation\\" than the works of Liturgy. According to Hunt-Hendrix, the music of Kel Valhaal, an electronic music project originally formed in 2010 as a rap act, is intended to use sounds that emulate transcendental catharsis.\\"New Introductory Lectures on the System of Transcendental Qabala\\". Kel Valhaal Official Bandcamp Page. Retrieved July 28, 2016. It wasn't until the previous two years before the release of New Introductory Lectures that her skills in making electronic music improved, leading to Kel Valhaal to become an electronic act.

Hunt-Hendrix said that the Kel Valhaal character, a protagonist in Hunt-Hendrix's script titled \\"01010n\\" that as of July 2016 is still in writing, is a hermaphroditic shaman that is a \\"logical agency of faith and acephalic becoming in\\" Liturgy's third studio album The Ark Work (2015).Joyce, Colin (June 10, 2016). \\"With His Electronic Project Kel Valhaal, Hunter Hunt-Hendrix Is Making Music for the End of Days\\".

As Hunt-Hendrix explained in an interview about the project's faith notion: New Introductory Lectures on the System of Transcendental Qabala fuses together elements of musical styles that range from Southern rap, industrial noise, acid house, new age and glitch music.Joffe, Justin (July 19, 2016). \\"As Kel Valhaal, Liturgy's Frontman Crafts a Mythos as Heady as His Music\\".

Conde Nast. Retrieved July 30, 2016. Hunt-Hendrix categorized New Introductory Lectures on the System of Transcendental Qabala as a \\"system of philosophy that's unfolding as a website in connection with the album\\", the website being a six-chapter book. The chapters are blog posts or RSS feeds covering a topic from different viewpoints. The cover art for the record is a diagram of the fictional \\"Four Alimonies\\". 01010n is the top alimony of this illustration, where Hunt-Hendrix said that \\"music is good for accessing this level\\". It contains several ports that send rays into the land of ANANON, where aspects of nature such as human bodies, forms of art and work are created by an \\"immaterial, invisible idea\\" and spawned to YLYLCYN, which creates gates and assemblages. Finally, the valves in S/HE/IM, which shares the same placement and has some relations with 01010n, fix the problem where there is \\"something wrong, something missing, something that was not allowed to show itself\\". Tracks Critic Joe Hemmerling wrote that some tracks on New Introductory Lectures \\"transpose metal‚Äôs labyrinthine structures into the sphere of electronic music\\". He used \\"Tense Stage\\" and \\"Ontological Love\\" as examples. The former song's foundation is a \\"sinuous interplay between its pounding bass beat and an urgent synth pattern\\". The track introduces several variations at an unsteady rate, resulting in the song being a \\"complex and unpredictable dance\\" track. As the song progresses, Hunt-Hendrix's voice is more incomprehensible as vocal track slicing and pitch-changing effects are used on it. The exact first half of \\"Ontological Love\\" is a \\"hypnotic instrumental\\", the rest of the track consisting of a rap verse from Hunt- Hendrix over \\"a swelling, swirling maelstrom of artificial strings\\". In the track, the rap consists of a \\"litany of jarring collisions between the sacred and the profane\\", lines including \\"I do cocaine with the clergy/ I teach peace to jihadis/ I show my tits to a leper.\\" \\"Bezel II\\", which closes the album, uses an improvised chiptune lead melody and the same instrumental and rap elements as \\"Tense Stage\\" and \\"Ontological Love\\". A majority of the other cuts on New Introductory Lectures are of short length, minimal and \\"more single- minded in their explorations\\" as Hemmerling described. \\"NMWE\\" only has multitracked vocal parts and a single improvised synthesizer riff in its instrumentation. \\"Bezel\\" features a \\"impressionistic\\", very distorted guitar line that Hemmerling compared to the beginning part of \\"High Gold\\", a track from Liturgy's second LP Aesthethica (2011). Hemmerling compared the latter half of \\"Kairos\\" to the works of John Carpenter. The album opener, \\"Mea Culpa\\", was described by Pitchfork Media writer Kevin Lozano as music that would be fit in an action scene of a science fiction horror Z movie. Release and reception Two tracks from New Introductory Lectures on the System of Transcendental Qabala were released as singles before the album's release. \\"Tense Stage\\" was the lead single of the record, released on May 26, 2016. The track also had an official music video containing 3D visuals by AUJIK, which was honored by Fact magazine as one of the \\"best videos\\" for the week of June 19, 2016.Kelly, Chris (June 19, 2016). \\"The week‚Äôs best videos: Danny Brown on VHS, D‚àÜWN in VR and Major Lazer go MMA\\".

Background The Ravat-Wonder-Dunlop cycling team has its origins in the Dunlop Grand Prix that was held in Victoria, Australia, between 14 and 19 November 1927. The plan was to find a team and send it to European races. The Dunlop Grand Prix was decidedly won by Hubert Opperman. He was asked to write an article for The Sporting Globe and he credited New Zealand rider Harry Watson, and fellow Australians Ernest Bainbridge and Percy Osborn in that article for helping make the race what it was. These were the riders selected to travel with him to France. Opperman was made captain‚Äîhe was chosen by the riders themselves‚Äîbut the team was more egalitarian than was traditional for European teams with their domestiques clearly in a sub-ordinate role. The Australasian team instead decided that they would help each other so they could ideally all finish the race. The initiative for sending the team came from The Sporting Globe in conjunction with The Melbourne Herald; the newspapers acted upon a suggestion made by the Victorian manager of the Dunlop Rubber Company, Stan Lough, at a dinner given for Opperman's win of the Dunlop Grand Prix. The moment that Henri Desgrange, the organiser of the Tour de France, cabled the acceptance of the Australasian team, the fund-raising effort began. Whilst the initiative was a national one, all three Australian riders were from Victoria and outside of the state, there was apathy as far as fund-raising was concerned. In New Zealand, The Sun was driving the effort; the initially Christchurch-based newspaper had just started publishing in Auckland, too. Fund-raising was also undertaken by the Athletic and Cycling Union for Watson. And as soon as Watson returned to New Zealand, races were held with the surplus going towards his expenses. The first such race was at English Park on 24 December 1927. Another fund-raising race was held at English Park on 4 February 1928. And a few days later on 8 February, a race meeting was held at the Caledonian Ground in Dunedin. In all these races, Watson competed‚Äîamongst others‚Äîagainst Phil O'Shea. Watson was trained by O'Shea (born 1889), himself a legend on the bike. O'Shea had a long career and competed from 1909 to 1932. If enough funds could be raised, O'Shea was to accompany the team to France, but this was not achieved and he stayed behind in New Zealand. A similar initiative was pursued in Koo Wee Rup in Victoria, where funds were raised to get the 1926 winner of the Melbourne to Warrnambool cycle race and fourth at the Dunlop Grand Prix‚ÄîLes Einsiedel‚Äîto accompany the team; again, this came to nothing. The committee in charge of organising the team comprised Norman Broomhall (president of the Australasian Federal Cycling Council) as chairman, W. Smith (president of the League of Victorian Wheelmen), A. D. Mc. Heywood (honorary secretary of the League of Victorian Wheelmen), Charles Brown Kellow (as a representative of the sporting public), J. M. Cross (handicapper of the League of Victorian Wheelmen), W. R. Forster (editor of The Sporting Globe and sporting editor of The Herald), and J. J. Maher (cycling editor of The Herald and The Sporting Globe). Kellow nominated businessman Bert Watson as his deputy on the committee. On 16 February 1928, Watson left by SS Manuka from Lyttelton via Wellington to Melbourne. In Melbourne, there were more races for fund-raising purposes and the four team members were fitted with blazers, caps and jerseys. The jerseys were emblazoned with national symbols of Australia and New Zealand: a wattle leaf and a kiwi. As part of a send-off party, the team was hosted at the Tivoli Theatre, where a movie of the Dunlop Grand Prix was shown. Osborne left Melbourne on the East-West express for Fremantle on 5 March 1928; the committee had agreed for him to appear in a promotional activity for the opening of their new Fremantle Cyclodrome. The other three riders left Melbourne the following days on the RMS Otranto.

In the early hours of that morning, Clarkson had met Spector while working at the House of Blues in Los Angeles. After leaving in Spector's limousine, the two were driven to Spector's mansion and went inside while his driver waited in the car. About an hour later, the driver heard a gunshot before Spector exited his house through the back door with a gun. He was quoted as saying, according to affidavits, \\"I think I just shot her.\\" Spector later said Clarkson's death was an \\"accidental suicide\\" and that she \\"kissed the gun\\". Spector was tried for the murder of Clarkson in 2007. On September 26 of that year, a mistrial was declared due to a hung jury, with ten jurors of twelve favoring conviction. He was tried again for second-degree murder beginning on October 20, 2008. On April 13, 2009, the jury found Spector guilty of murdering Clarkson. On May 29, 2009, he was sentenced to nineteen years to life in state prison.

Her body was found slumped in a chair with a single gunshot wound to her mouth with broken teeth scattered over the carpet.Phil Spector: The 'Mad Genius' of Rock'n'Roll, TruTV.com.

The 9-1-1 call from Spector's home, made by his driver, Adriano de Souza, quotes Spector as saying, \\"I think I've killed someone\\". De Souza added that he saw Spector come out the back door of the house with a gun in his hand. Forensic examinations could not find Spector's fingerprints on the gun. According to the prosecution, Spector had previously pulled a gun on four women. In each case, he had been drinking and \\"was romantically interested in the woman, but grew angry after the woman spurned him.\\" The prosecution alleged that on each occasion, he pointed a gun at the woman to prevent her from walking out. The prosecution argued that the testimony of the other women was important to demonstrating a \\"common plan or scheme.\\" The defense sought to prevent the women from providing such testimony.

Spector‚Äôs defence concentrated at trial on the claim Clarkson‚Äôs death was a suicide. As a result, counsel did not bring up Spector‚Äôs severe 1974 head trauma, but some observers have made the link. Studies have found traumatic brain injury raises the odds of subsequent violent crime, particularly in association with substance abuse. The retrial of Spector for murder in the second degree began on October 20, 2008, with Judge Fidler again presiding; this time it was not televised. The case went to the jury on March 26, 2009, and nineteen days later, on April 13, the jury returned a guilty verdict. Additionally, Spector was found guilty of using a firearm in the commission of a crime, which added four years to the sentence.Phil Spector Found Guilty Of 2nd Degree Murder, AP, April 13, 2009 Spector was immediately taken into custody and was sentenced, on May 29, 2009, to nineteen years to life in the California state prison system. Appeals The California Second District Court of Appeal affirmed Spector's conviction in May 2011 and denied his request for a rehearing of the appeal shortly thereafter. On August 17, 2011, the California Supreme Court declined to review the court of appeal's decision to affirm his conviction.People v. Spector, Cal. Supreme Court (no. S193961, August 17, 2011); Petition for review denied. Accessed September 24, 2014. In December 2011, Spector's attorneys petitioned for review by the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that his constitutional due process rights were violated when prosecutors used the trial judge's comments about an expert's testimony, effectively making the judge a witness for the prosecution. Spector's attorney Dennis Riordan argued the constitutional right to confront witnesses did not permit the prosecution to introduce at trial a videotape of statements made by the judge at a pretrial hearing that never were subjected to cross examination. In February 2012, the Supreme Court denied the petition.Spector v. California, no. 11-761, (docket report). February 21, 2012; retrieved September 24, 2014. In June 2012, Spector's attorneys filed a habeas corpus appeal in Federal District Court, once again on grounds that the original trial judge \\"did numerous inappropriate things which caused [Spector] a denial of his due process\\".

Films inspired by the case  * The Agony and the Ecstasy of Phil Spector, a television documentary directed by Vikram Jayanti, premiered on BBC Two in mid-April 2008. It consists of Spector's first screen interview‚Äîbreaking a long period of media silence. During the conversation, images from his first murder trial are juxtaposed with live appearances of his tracks on television programs from the 1960s and 1970s, along with subtitles giving critical interpretation of some of his song production values. While Jayanti does not take a position on Spector's guilt, the court case proceedings shown try to give further explanation of the facts surrounding the murder charges leveled against the producer. Spector also speaks about his life in the music business. * Phil Spector, a 2013 HBO film written and directed by David Mamet and starring Al Pacino as Spector and Helen Mirren as defense attorney Linda Kenney Baden, depicts a fictionalized account of the murder and first trial. The film drew criticism from Clarkson's family and friends, who charged that the suicide defense was given more merit than it deserved, and also from Spector's wife, who argued that Spector was portrayed as a \\"foul-mouthed megalomaniac\\" and a \\"minotaur\\".Gupta, P.

The southern and part of the central nave are revealed. The Bishop's Basilica is one of the most interesting cultural heritage sites in Plovdiv.  Location  The Bishop's basilica is located in the central part of Plovdiv, near the 19th century Roman Catholic St Ludvig cathedral and Maria Luiza blvd.  The basilica  The Bishop's Basilica of Philippopolis was built in the 4th century probably over an earlier building with a similar plan which covered the space for two insulae (quarters defined by four perpendicular streets). It was demolished and abandoned, probably in 577, when 100,000 Slavs stormed the Balkans. In the Middle Ages, local people used its remains as a source for ready-made building material. History of the bishop basilica The dimensions of the basilica are extremely large for that period. The overall length of the basilica is 86.30 m and its width ‚Äì 38.50 m. The naves are separated by 14 supporting posts: every two marble columns were followed by one masonry pillar. The Bishop's basilica of Philippopolis It has three naves with an apse situated at the East end of the central nave. There was an atrium surrounded by a colonnade on three sides to the West. The large size of the building, the rich decoration of mosaics and the specifics in the altar area organisation give reason to suppose that the building most probably was the Episcopal basilica. Only the South and part of the central nave are discovered and researched so far. The rest still lies under the nearby road connection Maria Luiza Blvd. and Tsar Boris III Obedinitel Blvd. In 2016 excavations works begun with the aim to discover the North nave of the basilica. The most interesting foundings at the Basilica are the mosaics that covered the floor. They spread across an area of 700 sq.m revealing extremely interesting motives, without analog in Bulgarian lands. The floors were covered with intricate mosaics with geometrical designs; eternal knots symbols; vases springing the water of eternal life; and an astonishing array of birds, the early-Christian symbols of pious souls. There is a difference in the composition and motives of the mosaics in the Southern and central naves, suggesting that most probably they were made by different craftsmen.

Archeologists surveyed the south nave, part of the central nave, the apse and a portion of the atrium. The mosaics were removed to the Plovdiv Archaeological Museum. On 26 September 2014, a project for the restoration and conservation of the basilica was presented, according to which the remains of the ancient church will become a museum complex. The project is funded by America for Bulgaria Foundation. In 2016, excavations in the North part of the basilica began in order to reveal the Northern nave of the basilica, which was hidden until that moment.

History of Adoor and Pandalam It is believed that the Pandya kings of Tamil Nadu fled to Adoor and Pandalam in the face of an attack from Cholas and settled there in the land they bought from Kaipuzha Thampan, a landlord. The Pandya dynasty had provinces on either sides of the Western Ghats. The King of Pandalam helped Marthanda Varma to conquer the Kayamkulam province. In return for this help, Marthanda Varma did not attempt to attack and conquer Pandalam or Adoor, during the expansion of his kingdom. The princely state of Pandalam had extended up to Thodupuzha in Idukki district once. Pandalam and Adoor was annexed to Travancore in 1820. Before the formation of Pathanamthitta district,Adoor and Pandalam was in Mavelikara taluk of Alappuzha district. King Marthandavarma once came to Adoor to hide from ettuvettil pillai's (a wealthy family who tried to capture King Marthandavarma and to get hold of his throne) and sought the help of nellimuttil family . Mannadi is also another historical place near Adoor where Velu Thampi Dalava died evading the Britishers. Both Pandalam and Adoor were part of Central Travancore and was never directly under British Rule. Adoor was a major town of wealthy Hindu families and nottable Syro-Malabar Christian families. Adoor was never captured by King Marthanadavarma. It is known that in the rule of the Ay Kings a Buddhist Monastery was there in Adoor. Modern Period In the nineteenth century Adoor was a census town. In the twentieth century Adoor was a fully developed town, with modern facilities like schools, libraries, hospitals etc. Adoor was made a municipality in 1988 and Pandalam after 2000. History of Ranni The history of Ranni can be traced 5000 years back to the early settlement activity of Adi Dravidans around Sabarimala and Nilackal. The temple at Sabarimala is an early temple of Kerala, dating back to around 2000 years. The deity's sitting posture and resemblance of the prayer 'Sharanam vili' to \\"Buddham Sharanam / Sangam Sharanam\\" points to the Buddhist past. Buddhist hermits always prefer to stay in interior jungles for solitary contemplation to attain Nirvana. The word 'Ayya' is a Buddhist Pali word means Lord/God. There was an ancient trade route passed through Nilackal between Kerala and Pandian kingdom. History of Thiruvalla This article is primarily about the history of the settlements in areas of present city around the temple, known historically as Tiruvalla. For the history of the places in Tiruvalla, also refer : History of Niranam, History of Koipuram, History of Kumbanad, History of Kavumbhagom. Middle ages The Kaavil market, which is no longer in existence, was once one of the most famous markets of Kerala, involved in foreign trade. Even now, the houses in this street are known as \\"Kaavil\\" among residents, and the houses in the area which is now Pushpagiri- Thukalassery are known as \\"Malayil\\" because they are in an elevated area compared to Kaavil. The Kaavil market was actually situated in the street starting from Erankavu Temple to the Kaavil temple in the present Kavumbhagom. It was also the first settlement area of the early Christians in Tiruvalla. The renowned Poem \\"Unnuneeli Sandesham\\" discusses this then famous street and its people. This was the heartland of Tiruvalla up to the 19th century. (East to MC road was forest area. Dens were found in the KSRTC garage area, which are now buried.) The first school in Tiruvalla started sometime in mid 19th century in Kaavil market, along the road to Pallippalam. Still, major religious processions are required to pass through this way, even though new roads have been constructed in parallel. Tiruvalla Christians were part of the autonomous Indian Syrian Church, which was not affected by the schism which occurred in the 17th century due to the intervention of Portuguese colonists. By 19th century, inspired by the work of the British missionaries, a reformation movement happened which eventually resulted in a schism, leading to the formation of Marthoma Church.  Modern period  Tiruvalla was never under direct British rule, and before India's independence from Britain, it was governed by the Travancore dynasty. The Tiruvalla municipality started functioning in 1919, with Shri M.K. Kesavan Nair as the first Chairman of the Municipal Council. The constitution was officially approved on 8 October 1920.

Born in Bra»ôov, in the Transylvania region, his father Dumitru Marin was a merchant from Izvoarele, D√¢mbovi»õa County, Wallachia, who fled north during the 1821 uprising. His mother, n√©e Hagi-Panteli, was from Bucharest. Gheorghe added Fontanin to his name; this was a latinization of his father's native village, Izvoarele (\\"the streams\\").PƒÉtra»ôcu, pp. 74-75 Associated with the Latinist school of Romanian culture, he later helped edit a Latin-Romanian dictionary. He studied in Bra»ôov and in a private boarding school at Sibiu. He continued his education at Cluj and at the University of Vienna, where he took a doctorate in philosophy. In 1848, he was in Bucharest, a participant in that year's revolution, but fled to Sibiu for a few months after the city was occupied by the Ottomans. He later returned to Bucharest and in 1851 moved to Craiova, where he became director of the Central School, which had shut down during the revolution. In 1853, early in the Crimean War, the Russian Army closed the school and turned it into a hospital. Fontanin protested and was imprisoned for seven months, but managed to reopen the following year. He ardently supported the Union of Wallachia with Moldavia, and in 1857 presided over the election of Dolj County deputies for the ad-hoc divan. \\"Fontanin, George Marin\\", at the Alexandru and Aristia Aman County Library Fontanin was noted for his considerable knowledge and reserved demeanor, and only formed a few friendships. Preoccupied by scientific problems and uncommunicative, he was seen as a legendary figure by the students. He taught various subjects: in the 1850s, he was responsible for Romanian, Latin, history and geography for one grade, and also served as inspector. In 1864, he took on the newly introduced subject of philosophy. His penchant for latinization extended to the schoolboys' names. He often spent summer vacations in Rome, deepening his studies and purchasing books in Latin, Italian, French, German and English, all languages he knew well, in addition to Hungarian and Old Church Slavonic. He was a gifted translator from Latin, also working on Greek philosophy and literature, as well as modern languages. Due to Fontanin's almost pathological reticence, many of his writings remained unpublished. In 1870, he was elected a titular member of the Romanian Academy. Membrii Academiei Rom√¢ne din 1866 p√¢nƒÉ √Æn prezent at the Romanian Academy site He founded a professor's club at Craiova and served as its president. In 1881, he edited its magazine, Vocea rom√¢nƒÉ, where eleven of his poems appeared. Fontanin retired as school director the same year. He died in Bucharest.

History Patricia Hackett was born in Perth, Western Australia to John Winthrop Hackett M.L.C. and his wife Dr. Deborah Vernon Hackett, n√©e Drake-Brockman, later known as Sir Winthrop and Lady Hackett. Sir Winthrop, who endowed the entire University of Western Australia, died on 19 February 1916 and Lady Hackett married again, on 10 April 1918 to Frank Beaumont Moulden (1876‚Äì1932) and moved to Adelaide with her children, living at \\"Lordello\\",Later St Ann's College. Perhaps named for Lordello Road, County Dublin, near Sir Winthrop's birthplace. Palmer Place, North Adelaide. He became Mayor of Adelaide in 1919 and was knighted in 1922. Patricia began law studies at the University of Adelaide in 1925 without having passed in Latin, which was then a pre-requisite, and applied to enter her articles while deferring this examination. Another student, Claude Joseph Philcox, made a similar request, both no doubt intending to study the subject concurrently. This had for some time been permitted by the great English universities, but the application was denied. In 1926 Patricia Hackett and her sister, Miss Joan Hackett (23 February 1909 ‚Äì 19 December 1966), were expelled from the University of Adelaide for impersonation at the Leaving examination in Latin. In other words, Joan Hackett sat the Latin exam for her sister Patricia Hackett.University of Adelaide Archives. Series 280, Item 494, Board of Discipline 1915-1930 Barred from further study in Australia, Patricia left for to London, where was admitted as a student to the Inner Temple in May 1928, completed her studies and returned with fellow-graduate Margery Lawrence to Adelaide in late 1929, and was called to the English Bar on 27 January 1930, one of four women (two of them Australian) to be so honoured. In 1933, as junior to Llandaff Brisbane Mathews (1896‚Äì1954), she defended Salem Macksad, a Syrian storekeeper of Gilbert Street, who was accused of murdering his neighbour Richard Joseph Supple, with whose wife he had an illicit relationship. The victim was found on Memorial Drive near the golf course with a fractured skull the evident cause of death. Macksad was convicted of the lesser crime of manslaughter. This has been cited as the first time in Australia a woman lawyer has defended a male accused of a capital crime, but appears to be the only high-profile case with which she was professionally involved. In 1936 she was invited to do some legal work at Tulagi, Solomon Islands, and returned there for three or four months each year thereafter, staying on the island of M'Bangai on which she took out a 99-year lease (one authority asserts purchased). She took out a practising lawyer's certificate in Fiji, their first woman lawyer. Notes accompanying offer to sell a handwritten and illustrated book A South Sea Legend by Patricia Hackett. Her last sojourn on the island was cut short by the Pearl Harbor attack of 1941, when she and many other Australians including Mrs. Ragnar Hyne and Mrs. W. H. Baddeley, wife of the Bishop of Melanesia, were evacuated. The young lawyer Don Dunstan shared chambers with Patricia for a few years from 1952. Theatre and Arts Soon after her return to Adelaide, Hackett threw herself into amateur theatre. In April 1930 she appeared in the comedy The Truth About Blayds by A. A. Milne, with the Repertory Theatre Group, their first production at the Australia Theatre in Angas Street. She appeared in half-a- dozen further Repertory productions in the next three years. In April 1934 she founded, and personally funded, in Gawler Place, \\"The Torch\\", Adelaide's first intimate theatre. The venue, seating 150 persons, was previously a sales showroom with an entrance on Claridge Arcade and stage access from Rundle Street via a narrow right-of-way. Membership was one guinea per annum, and entitled the holder to one seat per production and preferential purchase of additional seats for any performance. She created a minor furore in September 1934 after receiving an adverse critique in The Advertiser over her performance in Geza Silberer's play Caprice. (The News had, as usual, given her glowing, not to say sycophantic, reviews). Her response was to fling the contents of a bottle of ink over the hapless journalist Sidney Downer. Patricia then peremptorily barred all journalists from The Advertiser from her theatre. Later that year she took a long sea voyage \\"for her health\\", promising that \\"The Torch\\" would continue in her absence, but in fact it never reopened. In 1938 she published These Little Things, illustrated by Rex Wood, a collection of poems about her life in Adelaide and in the Solomon Islands.William Wilde et al, The Oxford Companion to Australian Literature Oxford University Press, Melbourne 2nd edition 1994 Patricia's acting was highly stylized, with an exaggerated gracefulness in the grand style, dominating every scene. She had a priceless collection of authentic Eastern costumes and \\"hard properties\\", with which she lavishly decorated her productions, adding to their other-worldly atmosphere. In 1944, following her appearance in Gild the Mask Again, Max Harris wrote in On Dit (the University of Adelaide student newspaper) a strident critique of Patricia's histrionic style: > We have now seen Miss Hackett as a Biblical dame, Virgin Mary, a Moon Woman, > Salome, a Grey Sword, Queen Elizabeth, and a Renaissance wife. It only > remains for her to play a Life of Stalin, Diaghilev and Little Nell. ... let > the Theatre Guild forget the panther passions of the Hackett demi-monde ... > (and place) ... more stress on Theatre and less on ArtQuoted by Jo Peoples > in Australian Dictionary of Biography, op cit; the Goers publication has a > somewhat longer excerpt Hackett sued for libel. On the advice of John Reed, Harris made an abject apology, so avoiding a costly lawsuit. Worse was to attend him: this happened on the eve of his publication of the Ern Malley poems and the ensuing obscenity trials.

In later years she suffered from arthritis, relieved by heroin, to which she became addicted. After an hiatus of several years, one last final performance was held in 1960 at the Mocatta House theatre, in conjunction with the inaugural Adelaide Festival of Arts: Legend, a performance which included much of Patricia Hackett's own verse. Dr. Mocatta inherited the house, which she left, along with her art collection, to the National Trust. Dubbed \\"Mocatta House\\", and whose history includes development by wine and distillation pioneer Wilhelm Nitschke,Nitschke was father of baritone Richard Nitschke and grandfather of cricketer Jack Nitschke. it was controversially sold in 1994, as later were the artworks. Other activities In February 1932 she represented her father posthumously at a ceremony in Perth to present his bequest which founded the University of Western Australia. Lady Moulden was conferred with honorary degree of LLD., the first woman to be so honored in Australia. In late 1934 Patricia took a sea voyage. She had a serious operation early in 1936, and in late March took a sea voyage to London with her little charge Elizabeth Kennedy (c. 1934‚Äì ), a niece of violinist Daisy Kennedy, later Mrs. John Drinkwater. Another report had her taking a voyage on a cargo boat with Dr. Mocatta. Whichever report was true, Patricia was in London in May. She had a (summer?) cottage \\"Nepenthe\\" at Nortons Summit in the 1930s and 1940s, and spent many holidays prior to the Pacific War in 1941 in the Solomon Islands, living in Tulagi harbor on the island of M'bangai, on which she had a long-term lease.Susan Magarey and Kerry Round Roma the First: A Biography of Dame Roma Mitchell Wakefield Press, Adelaide One report asserts that she had a legal practice in the Solomon Islands, where she was the first woman solicitor.Peter Goers and Colin Ballantyne Agnes and Hackett Performing Arts Collection of South Australia 1984.

The site is thought to be the remains of a kettle hole, a pond formed in the void remaining after a submerged glacial calf block melted. In contemporary times Campfield Kettle Hole is a mix of bog and pond. Location and natural features Campfield Kettle Hole is situated in the north-east of England, immediately south of the Anglo-Scottish border in the county of Northumberland, some south of the town of Cornhill-on-Tweed. The pond lies at above sea level within mildly undulating terrain, and is some north-south and east-west. The western end is a permanent pond; the eastern-end is prone to occasional flooding; the remainder of the pond has become peat-filled. The local area has a number of other kettle hole ponds; a second, Barelees Pond, lies east of Campfield. Vegetation The kettle hole has deep waterlogged peat soils supporting a carr woodland of birch (Betula sp.) with Scot‚Äôs pine (Pinus sylvestris). The woodland floor has bog-mosses (Sphagnum spp.), and hare‚Äôs-tail cotton grass (Eriophorum vaginatum) with purple moor-grass (Molinia caerulea) and wavy hair-grass (Deschampsia flexuosa). The western end of the pond is fringed with yellow iris (Iris pseudacorus), water plantain (Alisma plantago-aquatica) and willow (Salix spp). The perimeter has yellow iris and reed canary-grass (Phalaris arundinacea). The uncommon beetle Agabus uliginosus dispar has been recorded from the wetter areas of the site. The condition of Campfield Kettle Hole was judged to be unfavourable-recovering in 2013, with previous concerns about tree encroachment settled.

However, at the age of 46, Takatora unexpectedly produced a legitimate son, Takatsugu, who became 2nd daimy≈ç of Tsu domain on his father's death in 1632. The displaced Takayoshi was sent to a branch of the clan in Imabari, on Shikoku island, but was recalled by Takatsugu to head the main branch of the Todo clan in Ise Province in 1636. In 1632, the Todo clan was tasked by the Tokugawa shogunate with the rebuilding of the Second Bailey on Edo Castle. This was followed by the rebuilding of the Main Bailey on Edo Castle after a fire in 1639, and with the construction of the mausoleum for Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Iemitsu at Nikk≈ç T≈çsh≈ç-g≈´ in 1652. To add to the clan's woes, their castle town of Tsu burned down in a great fire in 1654. These extensive outlays effectively bankrupted the clan, despite efforts to increase revenues by the development of new rice lands and various fiscal reforms. The difficult financial situation of the domain would remain a problem throughout its history. In 1669, Takatsugu officially retired from his posts in favor of his eldest son, T≈çd≈ç Takahisa.

Takahisa initially was popular for implementing many of the economic reforms begun by the previous administration, including large-scale irrigation works and the development of new rice lands. However, his ban on mining of clay around Shiratoyama effectively destroyed the ceramics industry in Iga Province, and caused many potters to leave his domain for nearby Shigaraki in ≈åmi Province. Takahisa was married to the daughter of the tair≈ç Sakai Tadakiyo, who fell from favor in 1680 and who died under sudden circumstances in 1681. To avoid political troubles, Takahisa quickly associated himself with Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Tsunayoshi's favorite, Yanagisawa Yoshiyasu, to the extent that he was derided by his peers as \\"Yanagisawa's footmat\\". However, when Yanagisawa attempted to force the childless Takahisa to adopt his younger son as heir, the suicides of a number of his senior retainers prevented this from occurring.

Among youths and old, he is popular and beloved. Daasebre's songs are mostly mid tempo and include many hip hop elements. He featured many hip life artists like none of his genre colleagues. A major element of his songs is the Akan way of storytelling by use of proverbs. His proverbs stood out from others due to his upbringing through his grandmother. These proverbs mostly summed up the message of his songs. In an interview he claimed to have experienced some of the stories in his songs with the exception of the love songs. In 2006 Daasebre took a flight from Ghana to London to work on his music. At Heathrow airport he was arrested by police. His luggage contained cocaine of which he claimed to have no clue of.

His following lead single for his next album \\"Saa Na Etee\\" was mainly about his arrest. He talked about it in songs like \\"Twaso\\" and \\"Gye Me\\". His death in 2016 came at a time many Ghanaians musicians had died but his death was the most felt among all. As one part of his family were Muslim he should have received a Muslim burial but his other family refused. Their main reason was the fact he was of royal blood and should be buried as such. A long feud led to him been buried in December of that year, almost six months after his death. Many tributes to him followed after his death. \\"Kokooko\\" by Sarkodie and \\"Daasebre Gyamenah\\" by Daddy Lumba are two which have gained popularity. Life and career Daasebre was born a Muslim and from a royal home. His full name at birth was Daasebre Gyamenah Abubakar Siddiq. His late mother was a Muslim who died when Daasebre was only three months old. He was nicknamed Ahoofe, a name his fans gave him after the release of his hit song, \\"Ahoofe\\", which literally means beautiful or the handsome one. In January 2016, Gyamenah released what turned out to be his final album, Yenfii Ta, and in May released a song from the album and his final single, \\"Ntamago\\".  Death  He died in the early hours of 29 July 2016 at the 37 Military Hospital in Accra. Honours and awards He won two and four awards during the 2000 and 2002 editions of the Ghana Music Awards respectively.

Tsu Domain subsequently contributed forces to other battles of the Boshin War, including the Battle of Hakodate on the side of the new Meiji government. In 1868, Takakiyo was part of the guard to Emperor Meiji in his first pilgrimage to the Ise Grand Shrine.

Takasawa died the same year, and although only nine years old, Takasawa became daimyo of Hisai. The domain suffered from severe financial problems due to the frequent deaths of its lords, and lack of fiscal control. Under Takasawa, a series of reforms were implemented, including increased taxes, an involuntary saving system and fiscal restraint. A low-interest loan system was also implemented to encourage investment in new businesses and a reserve of capital was created to cope with natural disasters. In 1806, due to the premature death of his brother, Takasawa was transferred to Tsu Domain. At Tsu, he found the economic situation similar to that of Hisai, and therefore implemented the same reforms, despite the resistance of many sectors of society. One of his actions was a debt moratorium, which upset moneylenders. Takasawa attempted to set an example, by cutting his own stipends, and wearing cotton instead of silk. His efforts to combat corruption and to increase the arable land of the domain through better irrigation eventually paid off, and the domain‚Äôs finances recovered. Takasawa also strongly sponsored the domain‚Äôs academy, incorporating studies of rangaku as well as kokugaku and the martial arts. Takasawa died in 1825 of illness at the age of 44.

The text is a compilation of exemplary \\"advice offered by various ministers to Burmese sovereigns from the late 14th to the early 18th century.\\" It is \\"a repository of historical examples illustrating pragmatic political principles worthy of Machiavelli\\". It was also the first Burmese historical text to link Burmese kings to the Shakya clan of the Buddha and ultimately to Maha Sammata, the first king of the world in Buddhist tradition.Charney 2002: 185 It was one of the first four Burmese texts to be machine-published by the Burmese Konbaung Dynasty in 1871. Overview The Mani Yadanabon Kyan, \\"Treatise of Precious Jewelled Precedents\\", was completed on 24 September 1781(Aung-Thwin 2017: 62): 7th waxing of Thadingyut 1143 ME = 24 September 1781 by Shin Sandalinka, a senior Buddhist monk and the recipient of a high royal title under King Singu's patronage.Aung-Thwin 2005: 142 According to the author, the work was a compilation of several historical works and chronicles. It claims to describe the exemplary \\"advice offered by various ministers to Burmese sovereigns from the late 14th to the early 18th century\\".Lieberman 1983: 337 The book was probably modeled upon the Buddhist text Milinda Panha. \\"Each section typically begins with the king seeking advice on a historical problem,\\" which is then followed by the minister's advice or submissions, supported by \\"a wealth of didactic examples from religious and historical literature\\". Sandalinka also interleaves \\"condensed and cannibalized\\" historical context before particular submissions. About half of the compilation came from the 15th century treatise Zabu Kun-Cha, which recounts famous submissions by the Chief Minister Min Yaza to kings from Swa Saw Ke to Minkhaung I of the early Ava dynasty. It also includes submissions from later periods by famous ministers, including the 16th century Chief Minister Binnya Dala, the author-translator of the chronicle Razadarit Ayedawbon.Aung-Thwin 2005: 141 Nonetheless, the book is known mostly for the Min Yaza section, and commonly known as \\"Po Yaza's Submissions\\" (·Äò·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∏·Äõ·Ä¨·Äá·Ä¨ ·Äú·Äª·Äæ·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Ä∫·Äë·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏).See (Sandalinka 2009) which is marketed under ·Äò·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∏·Äõ·Ä¨·Äá·Ä¨ ·Äú·Äª·Äæ·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Ä∫·Äë·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏, with the official name getting second billing. The treatise was held in high regard by the Konbaung government, the last Burmese dynasty. It was one of the first four Burmese texts to be machine-published, which \\"shows the priority it commanded\\". Analysis The Mani Yadanabon belongs to a \\"largely unexplored Burmese literary genre dealing with statecraft and court organization\\". The book is \\"essentially a collection of moral tales,\\"Hudson 2004: 33 and \\"a repository of historical examples illustrating political principles worthy of Machiavelli.\\"Woolf 2011: 416 Still, the overall quality of the compilation is uneven. The most detailed and valuable part of this text, according to Aung- Thwin and Bagshawe, is the section on Min Yaza's submissions from ( 1368‚Äì 1421), after which the quality declines. The Min Yaza section is \\"very likely a good preservation of the 15th century work Zabu Kun-Cha, parts of which can still be found in the palm-leaf copy of 1825\\".(Aung-Thwin 2005: 361): The 1825 manuscript of Zabu is in the India Office Library. Per Aung-Thwin, only Part VI is related to Zabu while the other five parts are not. Though not officially a chronicle,Some scholars such as Aung-Thwin (Aung-Thwin 2005) and (Hudson 2004) list and analyze the Mani Yadanabon alongside other chronicles. Mani is noted for the amount of historical background information. However, much of Mani's accounts were \\"condensed and cannibalized\\" versions of then existing chronicles, and add little to the scholarly understanding of Burmese history. According to Lieberman, \\"[m]ost, if not all, of the material on the Ava period (1365‚àí1555) may be found in greater detail and accuracy in various local chronicles, and more especially in the early 18th century national chronicle by U Kala, the Maha-ya-zawin-gyi.\\" To be sure, Mani does offer differing accounts from time to time, some of which may be more accurate than those offered in the standard chronicles. One notable example is that Mani says King Thamoddarit founded the royal capital of Pagan (Bagan) in 26 ME (664/665 CE), close to 650 CE, given by radiocarbon dating,Aung-Thwin 2005: 185 and in contrast to the 107 CE date given in the standard chronicles.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 185‚Äì188 Its accession year for King Minkhaung I is also more accurate than that given in the standard chronicles.See (Sandalinka 2009: 65) for Minkhaung I's start of reign of 762 ME (1400/01) versus 763 ME (1401/02) by Maha Yazawin and Hmannan Yazawin. Per (Than Tun 1959: 128), Minkhaung I came to power on 25 November 1400 according to inscriptional evidence. However, the author did not synthesize differing dates, which likely came from different sources. For example, the text says Sri Ksetra and Pagan were contemporary to each other but the dates given for Sri Ksetra and Pagan are five centuries apart. Another notable mixed narrative is that Mani like Zabu does not mention King Anawrahta's conquest of Thaton at all. But it reverses Zabu's account that a company of monks took the Buddhist scriptures from Pagan to Thaton; instead, like Maha Yazawin's account, Mani states that the monks brought the scriptures from Thaton to Pagan.Sandalinka 2009: 8 Perhaps most importantly, Mani also marks the earliest appearance in the Burmese histories of Maha Sammata, the first human king of the world in Buddhist mythology, and Abhiyaza as the founder of the first Burmese state of Tagaung.Per (Charney 2002), the earliest evidence of linking of the monarchs to Abhiyaza and the clan of the Buddha was in the 1450s in Arakan (Rakhine). The Arakanese tradition had gotten more elaborate by the early 17th century, and continued to develop well into the 18th century, and reached Central Burma. Early Konbaung Kings of Central Burma starting in the 1770s began an effort to delink then pre-Buddhist origin myth of the Burmans with a more universal (Buddhist) myth that the Abhiyaza myth represented. The first official Konbaung chronicle Hmannan Yazawin (1832) not only adopted the Abhiyaza myth of Arakan but also introduced a Daza Yaza myth, essentially a repeat of the Abhiyaza myth, to specifically link the Konbaung kings to the Buddha. This origin myth allows all Burmese kings to descend from the clan of the Buddha in an apparent attempt legitimize the Konbaung kings by religious criteria. According to Hudson, \\"the section covering the time before Bagan could be viewed as a retrospective addition by the compilers of chronicles, designed to fill the period back to the Buddha with authentic dynasties.\\" Nonetheless, the claim would later be officially adopted in the 1832 Hmannan Yazawin, the first official chronicle of Konbaung Dynasty.Hla Pe 1985: 39‚Äì40 Translations L. E. Bagshawe translated the Min Yaza section into English. The partial translation, which represented \\"somewhat under half of the total\\", was published in 1981 under the name of The Maniyadanabon of Shin Sandalinka.

Until at least the 18th century, it lent its name to the surrounding area. History  14th‚Äì16th centuries  The gate dates back to the early 14th century; the first record of its existence comes from the Chronicle of Alfonso XI. The road that ran through it was then divided into two sections: Calle de Santiago (which ran from Plaza Mayor to the junction with Calle de Z√∫√±iga) and Calle del Campo, which ran from that junction to the gate. Puerta del Campo marked the city's southern limits and served a defensive purpose. It and the Puente Mayor (Main Bridge) were the two main entrances to the city, which was situated along the road to Madrid, giving it an important geographical role. Over time, as buildings went up outside the city walls, the gate lost its function as a barrier and city limit, but retained its historical and decorative significance. It is likely that the first battlement and turreted gate was maintained until the mid-16th century. At that point, the gate lost its medieval defensive features, perhaps because of urban remodeling or perhaps because of an architectural transformation of the structure itself. A corregidor reported in the second half of the 16th century that there was no longer a tower in the city walls. In 1565, Queen Elisabeth of Valois passed through Valladolid on her way to France to meet with her mother, Catherine de Medici. In her honor, the city lavishly decorated Puerta del Campo, where official receptions were customarily held. The gate was adorned with artwork by the sculptor Juan de Juni and the painters Benito Rabuyate, Mateo Espinosa and Antonio de √Åvila. Their paintings depicted kings and other members of the royal family, as well as mythological themes and allegories. When the queen entered the city on May 3, 1565, according to one report, \\"the 42 side windows\\" of the gate \\"were populated with musicians\\" who played harps, lyres, flutes and other instruments. Afterward, on May 16, a committee was formed \\"to make and sell the canvases and remains of the arch of the Puerta del Campo\\".\\"MONUMENTOS DESAPARECIDOS: La Puerta del Campo o Arco de Santiago\\", Arte en Valladolid More than twenty years later, in 1589, the gate was similarly decorated for a visit by King Philip II. In 1592, before another visit by Philip II‚Äîhis last to Valladolid‚Äîit was repainted and the placards on it replaced.  17th‚Äì19th centuries  Diego P√©rez's 1787‚Äì88 Plan of Valladolid shows Puerta del Campo at center, private houses at bottom right, and the Convento y Hospital de San Juan de Dios at top right.Some local historians say that once the gate had ceased to serve as part of the city walls, it was demolished and replaced by the Arco de Santiago, built in 1626 by Francisco de Praves. In May 1628, a committee was formed to repair the arch and turret. These repairs were finished in September of that year. On November 20, de Praves, the regidor of the city, was instructed to look into the cost of commissioning two sculptures to decorate the arch: one depicting Jesus' resurrection and the other the Virgin Mary. There is no evidence that these sculptures were completed, but the record is of interest because it is the only one in which de Praves is associated with the arch. 191x191pxIn 1655, it was decided that the arch would be decorated with portraits of Our Lady of Saint Lawrence and the archangel Michael, to be finished in April 1656. These images would become permanent guards and decorations of the arch, first on canvas and later as sculptures. In the decades that followed, portraits of the reigning monarchs were painted on the arch: For example, in 1690, portraits of Charles II and his wife, Maria Anna of Neuburg, were painted, and in 1707, they were replaced by equestrian portraits of Philip V and Maria Luisa of Savoy. Puerta del Campo just before its demolition.The appearance of the gate in the 18th century is documented in two works by the engraver Diego P√©rez Mart√≠nez, one from 1759 and the second from 1788. In the first engraving, the arch is ornately decorated with trimmed plates and Baroque reliefs and plasterworks. On the keystone of the arch is a kind of mask, adorned with wreaths. The attic‚Äîflanked with balusters, large buttresses and pyramids, and topped with a pediment‚Äîhouses the sculpture of the archangel Michael. In the second engraving, the decorations are much more severe, with some ornaments in recesses in the first section of the pilasters; however, the garland adorning the keystone is the same. It is not known exactly when the redecoration, which incorporated Neoclassical elements, took place. In 1858, in honor of a visit by Isabel II and the royal family, the arch was stuccoed and decorated with shields and inscriptions depicting men of Valladolid and the Spanish monarchs named Alfonso. Isabel II visited again in 1861, and this may have been the last time the arch was decorated for such an event. Ultimately, the arch was demolished because of its location just off Calle de Santiago‚Äîwhere traffic had increased significantly, especially after the opening of a railway‚Äîand because it and the adjacent walls spanned the entire width of the street.

The cathedral was built in 1860‚Äì1872 by a Russian Orthodox institute that operated in Jerusalem, under the Ottoman Empire government. The cathedral structure The structure was designed by the architect Martin Eppinger, as a basilica with two aisles, and rounded chambers in the side, which makes the cathedral cross-shaped. The cathedral is built from white stone, with eight steeples, with a cross on their top. The inside of the cathedral is covered with holy murals, and barely contains chairs. Most of the worshippers are praying standing, as is customary in Orthodox churches. History The Cathedral of the Holy Trinity was officially founded on 11 September 1860. In 1864 the outside was completed, but the construction was suspended due to budgetary issues. By 1872 the cathedral was luxuriously inaugurated, in a ceremony where Duke Nicholas participated. Since then the cathedral has been used by pilgrims and locals. The author of the project was a Russian architect Martin Eppinger. It was originally supposed to be consecrated as the church of St. Alexander Nevsky (the patron saint of Alexander II), but finally it was decided to dedicate it as the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity. In 1895 to 1897, the cathedral was renovated. The process included repairing the roof and fixing the blind area. Further, the glutinous paints on the walls of the Cathedral were scraped off, with three interiors painted white, and then the cathedral was decorated with sacred images. Next to the altar an indoor emergency exit was built. In the period of the British Mandate, the Trinity Cathedral remained independent and was in the jurisdiction of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia. During the first Arab-Israeli war, the temple was badly damaged. From 1948 it has been under the jurisdiction of the Moscow Patriarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church.

Moorehead, professor of archaeology at Ohio State and the curator of the Ohio State Archaeological and Historical Society's museum, in compiling a catalogue and map of archaeological sites in the state. Moorehead was forced to resign his post in 1897 when he contracted tuberculosis.

There, he became a doctor in medicine and surgery, as well as a specialist in obstetrics.Ion VƒÉduva-Poenaru, Enciclopedia marilor personalitƒÉ»õi, p. 209. Bucharest: Editura Geneze, 2004. He came from a Jewish family but converted to Christianity during his university days.

He worked as a doctor in Olteni»õa from 1858 to 1859 and in Muscel County from 1859 to 1861. His talent was noticed by Carol Davila, who invited Felix to Bucharest to teach hygienics and public health at the recently established national school of medicine and pharmacy, beginning with the 1861-1862 school year.E.

Felix served as chief physician of Bucharest from 1865 to 1870 and from 1875 to 1892. He was granted Romanian citizenship in 1871. In 1877-1878, during the Romanian War of Independence, he served as a combat medic, organizing military hospitals in the Turnu MƒÉgurele area. In 1879, he was elected a titular member of the Romanian Academy. From 1883 to 1887, he was dean of the medical faculty, and from 1892 to 1899 served as director of Romania's public health service. In 1884, he was vice president of the country's first physicians' congress. In 1898, and again from 1902 to 1904, he was vice president of the Academy's scientific section. In 1884, he was sent into the army reserves with the rank of colonel. Felix is considered the founder of Romania's school of hygiene and public health, a reputation he acquired during his lifetime. He led one of Europe's first hygiene departments and authored the first epidemiology textbook based on Pasteurian principles.

In recent years, with the tremendous studies on big data, another related but different problem, called community search, which aims to find the most likely community that contains the query node, has attracted great attention from both academic and industry areas.

VLDB Endow. 10, 6, 709-720. http://i.cs.hku.hk/~yxfang/acq.html  Main advantages  As pointed by the first work on community search published in SIGKDD'2010, many existing community detection/discovery methods consider the static community detection problem, where the graph needs to be partitioned a-priori with no reference to query nodes. While community search often focuses the most-likely communitie containing the query vertex. The main advantages of community search over community detection/discovery are listed as below: (1) High personalization. Community detection/discovery often uses the same global criterion to decide whether a subgraph qualifies as a community. In other words, the criterion is fixed and predetermined. But in reality, communities for different vertices may have very different characteristics. Moreover, community search allows the query users to specify more personalized query conditions. In addition, the personalized query conditions enable the communities to be interpreted easily. For example, a recent work, which focuses on attributed graphs, where nodes are often associated with some attributes like keyword, and tries to find the communities, called attributed communities, which exhibit both strong structure and keyword cohesiveness. The query users are allowed to specify a query node and some other query conditions: (1) a value, k, the minimum degree for the expected communities; and (2) a set of keywords, which control the semantic of the expected communities. The communities returned can be easily interpreted by the keywords shared by all the community members. More details can be fround from. (2) High efficiency. With the striking booming of social networks in recent years, there are many real big graphs. For example, the numbers of users in Facebook and Twitter are often billions-scale. As community detection/discovery often finds all the communities from an entire social network, this can be very costly and also time-consuming. In contrast, community search often works on a sub-graph, which is much efficient. Moreover, detecting all the communities from an entire social network is often unnecessary. For real applications like recommendation and social media markets, people often focus on some communities that they are really interested in, rather than all the communities. Some recent studies have shown that, for million-scale graphs, community search often takes less than 1 second to find a well-defined community, which is generally much faster than many existing community detection/discovery methods. This also implies that, community search is more suitable for finding communities from big graphs. (3) Support for dynamically evolving graphs. Almost all the graphs in real life are often evolving over time. Since community detection often uses the same global criterion to find communities, they are not sensitive of the updates of nodes and edges in graphs. In other words, the detected communities may loose freshness after a short period of time. On the contrary, community search can handle this easily since it is able to search the communities in an online manner, based on a query request.  Metrics for community search  Community search often uses some well-defined, fundamental graph metrics to formulate the cohesiveness of communities. The commonly used metrics are k-core (minimum degree), k-truss, k-edge-connected ,Lijun Chang, Xuemin Lin, Lu Qin, Jeffrey Xu Yu, and Wenjie Zhang. \\"Index-based optimal algorithms for computing Steiner components with maximum connectivity.\\" In Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 459-474.

IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering 29, no. 11 (2017): 2455-2469. etc. Among these measures, the k-core metric is the most popular one, and has been used in many recent studies as surveyed in.

The first series became available online on 8 August 2016 and aired on Three on 25 December 2016; it was released on YouTube in March 2017. The second series was released on ThreeNow on 15 September 2017. The series stars daughter-mother duo Thomasin McKenzie and Miranda Harcourt as the titular character and school principal. Miranda Harcourt's mother, Kate Harcourt, also makes a cameo appearance, as the school librarian. Plot In the first series, six mini episodes of 5‚Äì7 minutes follow Lucy Lewis (Thomasin McKenzie), a teenage Hills High student who hates public speaking, in an awkward and embarrassing journey of self-discovery. Lucy Lewis hates public speaking, but is voted class representative by well-meaning classmates who feel sorry for her because of her mild hip dysplasia, meaning she uses a crutch to walk. As class representative, she will have to give a speech at the opening of the cafeteria which will be streamed live on Newshub. She tries to get out of the role, but her teacher Mr Kinloch (Allan Henry) tells her she can't. After friend Ruby (Celia Macdonald) reveals that her family is struggling financially, and she discovers that Dave (RƒÅhiri Wharerau) is one of several students pretending to be Valley High Girls' students to get free breakfasts, she goes to principal Ms Parker to ask to start a free breakfast programme, but her request is declined. After snooping around Ms Parker's (Miranda Harcourt) office she discovers the principal wants to increase \\"voluntary\\" fees by thousands of dollars to get rid of children from poorer families. This leads her to change her mind about being class rep, but the principal changes the student representative to Stella (Catherine Pot), a wheelchair-bound classmate who Lucy doesn't get along with. Lucy, Ruby, and Dave make a plan to gatecrash Stella's speech and broadcast the principal's evil plan live. In the library, minutes before the ceremony, Lucy practices what she will say, but is overheard by the principal, who locks her in the library. Lucy texts Ruby to rescue her, and they rush to the ceremony. As they are about to go in, they meet Stella, who is about to go onstage, and Lucy convinces her to let her go instead. She enters the cafeteria and gives a speech about how the new cafeteria will be home to free breakfasts; the principal later agrees she will go ahead with it. Dave asks her if she can go to a free breakfast with him sometime, and she agrees, before telling the audience to \\"shut up.\\" In the second series, five mini episodes of 5‚Äì7 minutes follow Lucy Lewis as an anonymous Instagrammer, later revealed to be J'ess (Erana James), using the account \\"Hills Highs and Lows\\" (a play on the school's name, Hills High), posts the \\"best\\" and \\"worst\\" outfits at the school. When Lucy's friend Ruby's outfit is posted on the account, Lucy brings up the issue with principal Ms Parker. Ms Parker then institutes a dress code. While Lucy, Ruby, Charlie (Gala Bauf), and various other girls are in a dress code detention, Lucy realises the dress code is sexist and organises a protest. When the protesters are brought to the principal's office, Lucy tells her that the dress code is sexist. Ms Parker responds by starting a uniform. To decide what the uniform will be, she launches a competition to design the uniform. Lucy enters the competition, but at the presentation, she reads from the constitution, which the librarian (Kate Harcourt) helped her find, that \\"uniforms are henceforth forever banned at Hill High.\\" Cast *Thomasin McKenzie as Lucy Lewis *Miranda Harcourt as Ms Parker, the principal *Celia Macdonald as Ruby *Catherine Pot as Stella *RƒÅhiri Wharerau as Dave *Allan Henry as Mr Kinloch, Lucy's English teacher *Erana James as J'ess *Gala Baumfield as Charlie *Kate Harcourt as the librarian Production The series received $64,720 in government funding from NZ on Air.

Etymology and background Since at least the 16th century, the term \\"Goryeo pepper\\" has been used for varieties of the frutescens chili (and this usage is retained in some Kyushu dialects). In the Okinawan language, kooreegusu () still refers to the chili pepper itself but in Japanese, the term is applied to the awamori chili sauce while shima t≈çgarashi (, literally \\"island chili pepper\\") is used for the chili. According to the ', the chili was introduced by the Satsuma in the 18th century. There is a theory that the chili sauce might have been developed from Hawaiian chili pepper water by returning Okinawan migrants but its exact origin is unknown. Preparation and uses The chili peppers are washed and then soaked in awamori for at least 10 days. K≈çrƒìgusu is a commercial product (with added vinegar and citric acid) but is also often homemade. The sauce is long-lasting but the liquid will eventually become cloudy and should be discarded. Some varieties of k≈çrƒìgusu are made with vinegar or soya sauce instead of awamori.

The history of the Methodist Church in Malaysia began following a decision taken at the South India Conference held in Hyderabad in 1884, when William Oldham was appointed as a missionary to Singapore in 1885. The Tamil work started with the coming of a Ceylon Tamil, Mr Underwood. In 1894 the Tamil work was started in Penang by the Pyketts, and in Kuala Lumpur by the Kensetts and was continued by Rev. S Abraham from Ceylon in 1899. Methodism came to Sarawak in the year 1900 when a group of immigrants came from Foochow in mainland China. Missionaries came in 1903 in the persons of J.M Hoover and G.V Summers. Methodism grew rapidly in the town of Sibu and a solid foundation was laid. The work among the indigenous people, the Ibans, began in 1937 with pioneers like Lucius D. Mamora and Paul H. Schmuker who took the Gospel to the longhouses. The work amongst the Sengoi community in Pahang was started in 1930 with the help of missionaries from Sumatra, Indonesia. The Methodist Church in Singapore and Malaysia became a self-governing body in 1968. After the separation of Singapore from Malaysia, the Methodist Church in Malaysia became autonomous in 1976. Beliefs and Practices The Methodist Church in Malaysia declares itself to be part of the holy catholic church and affirms the historic ecumenical creeds, which are used frequently in its liturgy and services of worship.The Book of Discipline of the Methodist Church in Malaysia Additionally, the Methodist Church in Malaysia affirms the Articles of Religion of the Methodist Church as its doctrinal statement and adopts the General Rules of the Methodist Societies as a doctrinal standard. Membership The composition of the Methodist church in Malaysia reflects the racial composition of Malaysia. There are 400 churches and 634 preaching points with 552 pastors. The total membership of the Methodist church consists of 114,065 confirmed members, 63,396 preparatory members and 26,482 Baptized,Above 16 & Not Confirmed members. There are more than 80,624 weekly worshippers in all the churches. Organisation Governance There are six conferences under General Conference of The Methodist Church in Malaysia. The annual conferences were traditionally organised along linguistic and ethnic lines but the present day constituent congregations of the various annual conferences tend to be multi-lingual and multi-ethnic:Methodist Church in Malaysia : Organisation Chart * Chinese Annual Conference (CAC) :Chinese language congregations in Peninsular Malaysia * Tamil Annual Conference (TAC) :Tamil language congregations in Peninsular Malaysia * Trinity Annual Conference (TRAC) :English language congregations in Peninsular Malaysia * Sengoi Mission Conference (SMC) :Sengoi congregations in Peninsular Malaysia * Sarawak Chinese Annual Conference (SCAC) :Chinese, English and Malay language congregations in Sarawak * Sarawak Iban Annual Conference (SIAC) :Iban congregations in Sarawak :(including 1 congregation in Johor Bahru, Johor) * Sabah Provisional Annual Conference (SPAC) :Chinese, English and Malay language congregations in Sabah Education Education has been a vital aspect of the work of the Methodist Church in Malaysia from the very beginning. Today, a total of 83 schools and colleges throughout Malaysia are affiliated with the Church. Management and development of these institutions are coordinated by the Methodist Council of Education. These include 2 institutions of higher learning, the Methodist Pilley Institute in Sibu, Sarawak and the Methodist College Kuala Lumpur in Kuala Lumpur, 6 private schools, and the rest being government aided schools.

The institution specializes in maritime education and training. Its primary campus is located on the Palisadoes Park, overlooking the Kingston Harbour. The Caribbean Maritime University (CMU) is by name, content and operation, the Caribbean region‚Äôs centre of excellence for the training of professional seafarers and personnel in the shipping, logistics and supply chain management sectors. It was originally established as an Institute in 1980 by the Government of Jamaica in collaboration with the Government of the Kingdom of Norway initially to train Jamaican seafarers. in 1993 the organization became an autonomous body under the laws of Jamaica and within the Ministry of Public Utilities and Transport in accordance with the JMI Act of 1992. By 2001, the need for giving the Institute its present international flavour, content, size and structure was demonstrated by changing its name from Jamaica Maritime Institute to Caribbean Maritime Institute (CMI). To be consistent with the name change, the CMI established satellites in other Caribbean countries for the dissemination and delivery of its land based programmes, having adapted its novel Blue Ocean Strategy. With the installation of its new administration in July 2006 and the adoption of the blue ocean strategy, the Institute has henceforth been focusing on: ¬∑ Satisfying the ever growing demand, locally and worldwide, for qualified seafarers, ¬∑ Exploring the inescapable link between land, sea ,air and the multifaceted demand from these; ¬∑ Seeking to expand beyond the maritime boundaries and cut across the multimodal transportation and logistics chain. Against the backdrop of the above, the Institute has restructured/expanded and continues to expand its curricula to educate and train people to fit-into the three transport sub sectors of land, sea and air. With the passing of the CMU Bill in 2017 and the subsequent CMU Act, the Caribbean Maritime Institute transitioned to the Caribbean Maritime University. Today, the CMU is a multiple accredited, multiple award winning university with a proven track record of producing industry ready graduates. https://srs.cmu.edu.jm/page/homepage External Links Home Page: Caribbean Maritime University References Jamaica Kingston, Jamaica ","title":"Caribbean Maritime Institute"},{"id":"51209156","text":"Entrance gate to Jewish Cemetery in Kielce The Kielce Jewish Cemetery (also known as the Pakosz Cemetery) is located in the Pakosz District of Kielce, Poland, at the intersections of Pakosz Dolny and Kusoci≈Ñskiego Streets.

It is located between the Amager Hill combined incineration plant and ski slope to the north and Amager Strandpark to the south. It was created as a marine fortress to guard the entrance to Copenhagen Harbour in the second half of the 18th century and served military purposes until 1922. It now houses the city's petroleum harbor. Pr√∏vestensbroen at the end of Prags Boulevard links it with the rest of Amager. History The Pr√∏vestenen Battery Pr√∏vestenen in the Battle of Copenhagen in 1801 The area traces its history back to 1713 when a marine battery was established at the site by wrecking the floating dock Pr√∏vestenen. The work was led by O. ]udich√¶r. Another marine fortress, Trekroner Fort, was also built at this point. The battery fell into neglect over the following years. In 1723-24 three more ships were wrecked at the site to expand it but it was once again severely damaged by storms and ice and in 1736. In 1736, it was proposed to decommission it but the plans were never executed and it existed with a single guard until 1767-1767. It played a role in the Battle of Copenhagen in 1801. Carl Neumann in circa 1863 In 1802, a new marine fortress with the same name was created a little further to the north by wrecking three ships of the line. It fell into disrepair after the end of the English Wars in 1814 and was decommissioned in 1828. A third Pr√∏vestenen Fortress was built at the site in 1859-63 to design by Ferdinand Meldahl. Pr√∏vestenen in the 1930s The fortress was decommissioned in 1922 and sold to the Royal Danish Navy. It was subsequently converted into a Petroleum Harbour. Copenhagen's Port Authority took over all the former marine fortresses in 1933. Successive Land reclamations increased the area of the island over the next decades. An embankment connecting Pr√∏vestenen to Amager was also built but has later been replaced by a new one. Today Pr√∏vestenen is still home to Copenhagen's Petroleum Harbour but much of the capacity is no longer needed following the oil crisis in the 1970s and the discovery of oil and gas in the North Sea. Remains of Meldahl's fortress are still seen at the site. Plans for the large new Copenhagen Marina with room for 1,500 boats was put on hold in 2011.

Young's essay uses ideas from philosophers Simone de Beauvoir and Maurice Merleau-Ponty to examine how perceptions of the female body relate to task performance and confidence. Summary  Introduction  Young begins her essay with a critique of Erwin Straus, and his conclusion that the physical differences between men and women are biological. Straus studied the differences in how young boys and girls each threw a ball, and noted that the boys utilized more physical space and energy to exert their throw, concluding that the differences were due to a difference in biology. Young argues that because these children were pre-pubescent and were physically quite similar, their differing approaches were due to differing understandings of body comportment. To elaborate, Young introduces Simone de Beauvoir‚Äôs account of women‚Äôs existence as constrained. Young asserts that de Beauvoir neglected several important aspects and, formulated to misconception that women's anatomies that determine their being unfree. The female body then becomes something to transcend, or break free from, rather than something that people recognize is in fact conditioned to be the way it is. Young explains this gap in understanding as her motivation in writing the essay; to examine further the functionality of women's bodies in a given space. The society she focuses on is about women in a \\"contemporary advanced industrial, urban, and commercial society\\" specifically, with attention to how the modalities of the feminine body are restricted in attempt to achieve specific goals, such as throwing a ball. To outline the framework of her essay, Young first defines what it means to be feminine as \\"a set of structures and conditions which delimit the typical situation of being a woman in a particular society, as well as the typical way in which this situation is lived by the women themselves.\\" Femininity is therefore not a characteristic or trait, but a quality of the female existence. Young argues women are \\"Others\\" in society, and are deprived of basic human qualities because of their sub-ordinance within the patriarchy. Women must therefore struggle to transcend this bodily comportment, Young argues.  Section I: Observations on Feminine Body Comportment  Young returns to Straus's observations of women engaging in physical activity, and also incorporates her own experiences to make the argument that women are physically no less capable than men, but underperform due to psychological barriers. She claims that women engage in a self- fulfilling prophecy, in which they do not see themselves as capable, so they do not ‚Äúsummon the full possibilities of our muscular coordination, position, poise, and bearing‚Äù as men. This is partially attributable to the idea that a woman has a constricted space to move in, while a man does not feel these limitations. In addition to the fear of taking up too much space, women also have a stronger fear of getting hurt, and underestimate their bodily capacity. Young writes, \\"We decide beforehand ‚Äî usually mistakenly ‚Äî that the task is beyond us, and thus give it less than our full effort.\\" This concept results in the phrase, \\"throwing like a girl;\\" although women are physically capable of throwing, and performing other physical tasks, successfully, their understanding of societal bodily comportment restricts their performances of those tasks.  Section II: A Phenomenological Account of the Modalities of Feminine Bodily Comportment & Mobility  In Section II, Young explains three modalities of feminine mobility that prevent a woman from engaging in the world to her body's full capacity. She cites Merleau-Ponty, Satre, and previous \\"intellectual thinkers,\\" who argued that a person could transcend societal boundaries by consciousness alone. Young contests this idea, observing that the body itself must remain aware of its surroundings in the effort to transcend. She identifies feminine transcendence as ambiguous transcendence, explaining that \\"all transcendence is ambiguous because the body as natural and material is immanence.\\" Young refers to her previous observations that women only use parts of their body to perform a task, and thus concludes that while these parts move, the rest of the female body remains rooted in immanence. Women simultaneously view their bodies as a burden and as something that needs protecting. Young explains this existence as in an inhibited intentionality. She writes, \\"When the woman enters a task with inhibited intentionality, she projects the possibilities of that task ‚Äî thus projects an \\"I can\\" ‚Äî but projects them merely as the possibilities of \\"someone,\\" and not truly her possibilities ‚Äî and thus projects an \\"/ cannot.\\" This again refers to her previously stated self-fulfilling prophecy, in which women do not succeed in tasks to the best of their ability because they do not believe that they can do so. The third modality of feminine mobility presented in Young's essay is discontinuous unity. Young theorizes that the female body sees its surrounding space as \\"a continuous extension of its own being,\\" thus restricting its own movement. Additionally, the parts of a body that move when performing a task are isolated from the rest of her body, which remains immobile. Merleau-Ponty explains that women thus see their bodies as both the subject and object of an action; for example, \\"women have a tendency to take up the motion of an object coming toward them as coming at them.\\" When a woman views her body as the object of the action rather than the subject, it is even more difficult for her body to transcend and perform to its full capability. Young concludes that women therefore have constrained bodily comportment and mobility, because they sees their bodies as objects rooted in an imminence they are unable to transcend.  Section III: The Spatiality Generated by Modalities  Young next delves into the concept of female bodies in their respective spaces, and introduces Merleau-Ponty's distinction between lived space and objective space. These two concepts merge for men, but for women, their existence is confined in their living space and does not expand into all objective space. Young cites a study by Erik Erikson, in which Erikson asked several young male and female participants to construct a scene for a movie, given a set of props. He observed that the females set their scenes constricted inside, utilizing \\"inner space,\\" while the males set their scenes in the outdoors, utilizing \\"outer space.\\" Erikson concluded that this was a psychoanalytic expression, with respect to each gender's anatomies ‚Äî the female subjects subconsciously projected the inner space of their wombs and vaginas, while the male subjects subconsciously projected the outer space their phalluses occupy. Young discredits this theory, and argues that women favored inner space, because that is where their bodies move in space. In terms of limited mobility, Young writes that women often use and inhabit a smaller space than what is realistically available. For example, when a ball is thrown, a woman will \\"stay in one place and react to the balls motion only when it has arrived within the space where she is.\\" The female spatiality is limited based on her limited perception of what she is physically capable of, if she were to be able to transcend her body's discontinued unity. Because women are seemingly stuck within their inner spaces, they experience a double spatiality, in which there is a perceived difference between space \\"here\\" and \\"yonder.\\" Young contends that women are positioned in space, while men can freely move through it. This further contributes to a woman viewing her own body as an object, because she does not have the autonomy to move her body freely to constitute actions, but rather she remains within her space and receives the action. Young demonstrates this assertion by referring back to her observations that women only use parts of their body to perform a task, while the rest remains immobile, stuck in its constricted space. This further proves her previous rejection of Erikson's conclusions; because a woman sees herself as rooted and enclosed in a space, \\"then on the reversability assumption it would follow that visual space for feminine existence also has its closures of immobility and fixity.\\"  Section IV: Implications, Understanding the Oppression of Women  Young concludes the paper with the assertion that these constraints are the result of living in a patriarchal, and sexist society. Women are not given the societal acceptance to take up as much space as men, and are taught from a young age to contain themselves in a small, enclosed, \\"inner space.\\" Young girls are taught, both implicitly and explicitly, to follow the precedent of limited female spatiality and consequentially grow into \\"throwing like a girl.\\" Once these girls have reached womanhood, they have embraced the conception that their bodies are fragile, and are both a subject and an object to be protected; women are aware that their bodies are seen as sexual objects by men, and that their bodies are objects receiving the male gaze. Young argues this further entrenches the discontinuity a woman has with her own body, as she fears that being outwardly direct will be perceived as an invitation to be objectified. She writes, \\"The woman lives her space as confined and enclosed around her at least in part as projecting some small area in which she can exist as a free subject.\\" While Young contends she has drawn sufficient conclusions on the modalities of feminine mobility, she introduces several questions that her paper raises. She questions how women perform differently than men in activities that do not require full-body movement, and in activities that do not have a clear goal, such as sex or dancing. Furthermore, Young questions how the constrained spatiality of the feminine body affects women's lives as a whole; she concludes with the suggestion that the lack of confidence women have about their physical abilities has resulted in their lack of confidence to be successful in cognitive or leadership abilities. Scholarly reception This essay has become a classic in feminist theory for its attention to female experiences and embodiment. It has been praised for breaking radical new ground in philosophy and providing a strong foundation for performance and corporeality studies.

Life  Born in Ho≈ôinƒõves he spent much of his life in Bohemia but also lived in Vienna, Edinburgh and for some time in Ukraine serving in the army. Because of problems in his research including the publication of false information and the submission of stolen specimens with fake data, much of his work remains under a cloud of uncertainty. Prazak researched the wild horses of the Ethiopian region at the University of Edinburgh between 1896 and 1897. He described the subspecies Equus quagga zambeziensis in his Edinburgh manuscript of 1898 (unpublished) which was cited by Trouessart who also noted the author for the name zambeziensis as Pra≈æ√°k. He published numerous works in ornithology but a lot of his work was doubted even during his lifetime. His records of the birds of Galicia included rarities and included a mass of collections that simply could not have been collected in the time period mentioned and it was noted by von Tschusi and Lorenz von Liburnau that there was no way he could have collected in some of the places in which he obtained some specimens and has subsequently come to be recognized as fraudulent. He was requested to respond to the statements made against his observations by Lorenz von Liburnau and he failed to respond. He described many fake species of bird including Vanellus grisescens which he claimed was collected by Richard Materna in northern Chile and Trochalopteron hennickei supposedly collected by Jaworowski from the Hunan Province of China. He also contributed a paper on bird migration with arrival dates for species in eastern Bohemia. His data covered more than a hundred years and this was submitted to the Hungarian journal Aquila but was suspected to be fraudulent and not published. Like Richard Meinertzhagen he too stole specimens from museums and resubmitted them with altered labels. Ernst Bauernfeind, a curator at the Natural History Museum at Vienna (Naturhistorisches Museum Wien, NHMW) found that a Bohemian specimen of Prunella montanella (NHMW 11423) that Pra≈æ√°k submitted matched details to a specimen collected by Dybowski at Kultuk, Lake Baikal, which had gone missing. Otto Kleinschmidt, who had corresponded with and had noted various inaccuracies in information provided by Pra≈æ√°k, concluded in his obituary that the latter suffered from kleptomania and that he was possibly mentally ill. Pra≈æ√°k returned from Edinburgh, got married and taught in private schools for a while and briefly took part in political agitations. He died of tuberculosis and few ornithological journals covered his death.

Facade with bell- tower in rear. Interior facing apse History A church at the site dates likely to the 4th or 5th centuries, when a church was erected upon the ruins of a former pagan temple, and dedicated to Saint Thecla, a virgin and martyr from Anatolia. The cathedral has been refurbished over the centuries. It was rebuilt in the 8th century till possessing five naves. The church was reconsecrated by Pope Leo IX in 1052. Until the 16th century, the layout continued to have the apse in the east. During a refurbishment during 1583 to 1592, designed by Vincenzo Scamozzi, the facade was re-oriented. After an earthquake in 1688 damaged the church, and a complete reconstruction was promoted by the town archpriest Marco Marchetti, using designs for an elliptical nave with a tall cupola, by the Venetian architect Antonio Gaspari. Work begun in 1690 with the blessing of the bishop Gregorio Barbarigo, and was completed in 1720 with consecration by Cardinal Rezzonico, the future Pope Clement XIII. The facade was never completed, and remains in rough brick. The lower part of the bell-tower dates to the 8th century, but it was raised to its present height in 1724 by the architect Rossi.La patria; geografia dell' Italia: provincie di Verona, Vicenza, e Padova, 1890, by Gustavo Chiesi and compiled Gustavo Strafforello page 436.

The Dock Street Market was located on Dock Street in Society Hill. Dock Street is three blocks long, and runs from Sansom Street to Spruce Street, and between Third and Front Streets. The market was busiest between midnight and eight in the morning when produce was loaded and offloaded between delivery trucks and warehouses. Dock Creek Map showing the former course of Dock Creek and its tributaries in Philadelphia The area around Dock Creek was first settled in the seventeenth century. William Penn thought the mouth of the creek a good site to dock ships. Leather tanners had used Dock Creek since the city's early days, both as a water source in which to soak animal hides, and for refuse disposal. Benjamin Franklin and others petitioned to remove the tanners to a more remote part of the city in 1739. The city built a covered sewer with a brick arch, in two stages, in 1765 and 1784. In 1763, the creek was used as an open sewer and described as \\"a Receptacle for the Carcasses of dead Dogs, and other Carrion, and Filth of various kinds, which laying exposed to the Sun and Air putrify and become extremely offensive and injurious to the Health of the Inhabitants.\\" Residents covered the creek above Second Street by 1769 and Dock Creek was completely covered to its outlet at the Delaware by 1784. The sewer became inadequate in the 1840s and frequently overflowed to the streets above. The city built a culvert under the streets to carry the stream. During the redevelopment of Dock Street in the 1960s, new sewer lines were constructed in the area and archaeologists investigated the site. Dock Street continues to run on top of the old stream bed. 1870-1959 In June 1842, Philadelphia's municipal council referred to the Committee on Police a proposal, \\"...asking that the stands for Market Wagons, vending their produce, may be changed from [Second street, between Chestnut and High streets] to Dock street, between Second and Front.\\" The advent of motor trucks between 1918 and 1920 opened the Dock Street market to growers in South Jersey. In 1958, Dock Street was one of four major produce markets in Philadelphia alongside the Callowhill Street Market, the Baltimore and Ohio Produce Terminal (used for auction sales only), and the Pennsylvania Railroad. Move to South Philadelphia Merchants' Exchange Building from 214 Dock Street in late 1950s. In the late 1950s, Society Hill was considered a slum neighborhood,, p.119 and the market had come to be known for its congestion and noise in the early morning hours, and the infestation of vermin that fed on the discarded produce. Edmund Bacon, city planning director, convinced the city to spend $17 million to acquire land and invest in infrastructure. The United States Department of Agriculture had published a study in 1951 supporting the move of the market to Delaware and Oregon Avenues in South Philadelphia. The Philadelphia City Planning Commission and the Redevelopment Authority targeted Society Hill including the market.\\"History\\" on the Society Hill Towers website From 1957-1959, the Greater Philadelphia Movement, the Redevelopment Authority and the Old Philadelphia Development Corporation bought around Dock Street. They relocated and demolished the Dock Street market, setting aside of land that would become the Society Hill Towers.Le Faivre-Rochester, Carole. \\"Society Hill Towers: A Bold and Graceful Venture\\" in Baron, Herman (ed.) I.M. Pei and Society Hill: A 40th Anniversary Celebration. Philadelphia: Diane Publishing Co., 2003, p.35 In June 1959, the Dock Street Market merchants moved to the new Food Distribution Center on South Galloway Street in South Philadelphia. The move from Dock Street to the Food Distribution Center in 1959 changed the structure of the wholesale produce market by centralizing distribution through a fewer number of larger wholesalers. Alfred Joseph Burns wrote in 1968, > Most of the 1958-64 decline in the number of wholesalers was among small > firms.

He ruled in the Jejakabhukti region (Bundelkhand in present-day Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh). He practically established the Chandelas as a sovereign power, although he formally acknowledged suzerainty of the Gurjara-Pratiharas. His major military achievement was the conquest of Kalanjara (modern Kalinjar). He is also notable for having commissioned the Lakshmana Temple at Khajuraho.  Early life  Yashovarman was born to the Chandela ruler Harsha, who was a feudatory of the Gurjara-Pratiharas of Kanyakubja (Kannauj). His mother was Kanchuka, who came from a Chahamana family. By the time Yashovarman's ascension, the Pratiharas depended on their feudatories to a large extent. The Rashtrakutas, who were the main rival of the Patiharas, were busy in dynastic feuds. This offered the Chandelas an opportunity to increase their own power. Yashovarman did not formally give up the allegiance to the Pratiharas, but he was practically independent.  Military successes  Yashovarman conquered the important fortress of Kalanjara, although the identity of his enemy in this campaign is not certain. One theory is that he conquered Kalanjara from his overlords, the Gurjara-Pratiharas. Another theory is that he defeated the Rashtrakutas, who had captured Kalanjara from the Pratiharas. The Karhad copper-plate inscription of the Rashtrakuta king Krishna III states that \\"the hope about Kalanjara and Gurjara vanished from the heart of the Gurjara\\"; that is, the Gurjara-Pratihara king gave up all hopes of retaining control of Kalanjara and Chitrakuta. Based on this, H. C. Ray theorized that Krishna managed to capture these two forts from the Pratiharas. Yashovarman may have captured the fort from the Rashtrakutas, which may explain why he continued to recognize the Pratihara sovereignty even after conquering Kalanjara. However, there is no definitive evidence of Yashovarman's victory over the Rashtrakutas. R. K. Dikshit points out that the Rashtrakuta claim is part of a possibly exaggerated poetic eulogy. It may not imply an actual conquest of these two fortresses, and may only mean that the Pratihara king became apprehensive about losing control over them. K. A. Nilakanta Sastri speculated that Yashovarman captured Kalanjara after allying with the Rashtrakutas and the Chedis (Kalachuris of Tripuri). However, there is no historical evidence attesting the formation of such an alliance. Despite these uncertainties, Yashovarman's conquest of Kalanjara is undisputed: his successors, including his son Dhanga, titled themselves Kalanjaradhipati (\\"Lord of Kalanjara\\"). A Khajuraho inscription dated 1011 VS (953-954 CE) credits Yashovarman with several other military successes. It declares: These claims appear to be exaggerated, as similar claims of extensive conquests in northern India are also found in the records of the other contemporary kings such as the Kalachuri king Yuva-Raja and the Rashtrakuta king Krishna III. The ruler of the Gauda region (in present-day West Bengal) is believed to be a Pala king, possibly Rajyapala or his successor Gopala II. The Palas attempted to resurrect their power through westward expansion, which might have resulted in their conflict with the Chandelas. The Chandelas did not occupy Gauda, but their invasion further weakened the Pala power, possibly paving way for the subsequent usurpation of the power by the Kambojas. The Chedis in the Khajuraho inscription denote the Kalachuris of Tripuri. Although the Chandela- Kalachuri relations were friendly in the preceding years, it appears that the Kalachuri alliance with the Rashtrakutas led to a rivalry between the two kingdoms. The Chandelas acknowledged the suzerainty of the Pratiharas, who were the rivals of the Rashtrakutas. The Kalachuris, on the other hand, had forged matrimonial alliances with the Rashtrakutas, and probably aided them in their anti-Pratihara campaigns. The identity of the Kalachuri king defeated by Yashovarman is not certain, because three Kalachuri kings ruled in quick succession as his contemporaries: Bala-Harsha, Yuva-Raja and Lakshmana-Raja. S. K. Mitra theorizes that the defeated king might have been Bala-Harsha, who ruled for a very short period, and whose name has been omitted from some of the records of his successors. Yashovarman's achievements in Mithila are not certain; he possibly defeated a tributary ruler who occupied a small territory on the Pratihara-Pala border. The Malavas referred to in the inscription might have been the Paramaras, who were the Rashtrakuta feudatories in Malava region at that time. The Koshalas might have been the rulers of the Dakshin Koshala region, possibly the Somavamshi allies of the Kalachuris. Yashovarman probably raided their territory. The claim of Yashovarman's successes against the Kashmiris seems to be a poetic exaggeration. L. F. Kielhorn translated the verse about the Khasas (tulita Khasabalah) as \\"equalled the forces of the Khasas\\". However, according to R. C. Majumdar, in this context, the word tulita means \\"treated with contempt\\", not \\"equalled\\". The Khasas were the neighbours of the Kashmiris, and this too, seems to be poetic embellishment. The Kuru region was a part of the Pratihara territory, so the claim about the Kurus also seems to be an exaggeration. However, it is possible that the Chandelas clashed with the Gurjara-Pratiharas after their occupation of Kalanjara. The Khajuraho inscription also states that Yashovarman turned the rivers Ganga and Yamuna into his \\"pleasure-lakes\\", and that the waters of these rivers became muddy when his might elephants bathed in them. This suggests that Yashovarman controlled the area around present-day Allahabad.  Personal life  Yashovarman married Puppa, who was the mother of his successor Dhanga. Krishnapa, his other son, was probably deputed to oversee the territory on the Chandela-Parmara frontier. Yashovarman's reign marked the beginning of the famous Chandela-era art and architecture. He acquired a prestigious statue of Vaikuntha Vishnu from his overlord Devapala, and commissioned the Lakshmana Temple at Khajuraho. This is the earliest example of Nagara architecture at Khajuraho. He is also said to have commissioned a water tank, which can be identified with one of the tanks in Khajuraho.

It is a shrub similar to both Verticordia dichroma and Verticordia spicata which grow in the same area and is thought to be a stable hybrid between those two species. It has mostly egg-shaped leaves and spike-like groups of dark magenta-coloured flowers which fade to straw- coloured, in late spring and early summer. Description Verticordia √ó eurardyensis is a shrub which grows to a height of and up to wide. The leaves are arranged in decussate pairs, egg-shaped to elliptic, dished and long. Their margins are slightly hairy or have minute teeth. The flowers are scented and arranged in spike-like groups near the ends of the branches, each flower on a spreading stalk about long. The floral cup is top-shaped, about long, has 5 ribs, large green appendages and is glabrous and wrinkled. The sepals are about long, dark magenta to maroon and spreading, with 8 to 11 feathery lobes. The petals are the same colour as the sepals, about long and erect with a fringe a further long. The style is about long, hairy and bent near the tip. Flowering time is from October to December. The plants appear to be a stable hybrid between two verticordia species - V. dichroma and v. spicata, both of which occur in the same area. Taxonomy and naming Verticordia √ó eurardyensis was first formally described by Elizabeth and Alex George in 1994 from a specimen collected from Eurardy Reserve. The description was published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (√ó eurardyensis) is derived from the location where the species is found. George placed this species in subgenus Eperephes, section Pennuligera along with V. comosa, V. chrysostachys, V. lepidophylla, V. aereiflora, V. dichroma, V. muelleriana, V. argentea, V. albida, V. fragrans, V. venusta, V. forrestii, V. serotina, V. oculata, V. etheliana and V. grandis. Distribution and habitat This verticordia grows in sand in low heath and shrubland. It only occurs in Eurardy Reserve, a former pastoral station north of Kalbarri National Park in the Geraldton Sandplains biogeographic region. Conservation Verticordia √ó eurardyensis is classified as \\"Priority One\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is known from only one or a few locations which are potentially at risk.> Use in horticulture Only a few specimens of Verticordia √ó eurardyensis have been propagated and only in Kings Park Botanic Garden.

She was a senior lecturer at the University of Manchester and oversaw its Botany department merged with ten other departments and worked to ensure it would be established in the new school. Biography Early life Cutter was born on 9 August 1929 in Edinburgh. She was the only daughter of Roy and Alix Cutter. Her parents met in Sudan in 1928, where Roy had been working as a judge colonial civil service. Both remained there until 1936, and during that period, Cutter was cared for by three maiden aunts. She went to an all-girls boarding school, Rothesay House, where she became its head girl. Cutter, along with the other students, were evacuated to Paxton House near Coldstream during the Second World War, and were required to shelter in the school's basement when German warplanes flew overhead. She graduated from the University of St Andrews in 1951 with first class honours degree in botany. Cutter later studied a PhD at the University of Manchester from which she graduated in 1954. Immediately after her second graduation she was appointed assistant lecturer at Manchester where she served between 1955 and 1964. Career Cutter left the position after she was approached by the University of California, Davis to replace their plant anatomist Katherine Esau. Four years later, she was promoted to a full professorship role. Cutter's reputation was enhanced following the publication of a two-work publication on Plant Anatomy that was used as an undergraduate paper across the United Kingdom and North America. She resigned her position in 1972 in order to care for her mother in the United Kingdom, and was promoted to the position of a senior lectureship at the University of Manchester. Seven years later Cutter was promoted to the George Harrison Chair of Botany. She became aware that the department need to regain its past reputation although it would require a large amount of work in order for this to occur. However this had difficulty when the government of Margaret Thatcher reduced the amount of funding for universities which meant Cutter was unable to recruit new staff. Botany and ten other departments in Science and Medicine merged to form Manchester's School of Biological Sciences in 1986. Cutter worked to ensure that Plant Sciences could establish itself as a secure position in the new School, despite raising concerns that the re-organisation would disadvantage the university's Botany department, and became a loyal supporter to individuals who led the school. Cutter was the leader of a root and branch revision of the undergraduate curriculum which resulted in the foundation of 18 modular-based B.Sc. degrees in biological sciences. Although the school was established by the University's wish to improve research, Cutter had attracted an increase of student choice because of her leadership had ensured the benefits would be improved. She additionally held office in several societies including fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, membre of the Botanical Society of America, the Linnean Society of London, the International Society of Plant Morphologists and the Society for Experimental Biology. Later life, legacy and death Cutter had been regarded by many people as an excellent teacher and field botanist and led undergraduate field courses and she continued to participate in them in Manchester even after she became their Head of Department. She published over 50 papers and her research reputation attracted from graduate students from across the world. Cutter later retired from her position and settled in Gattonside where she pursued her lifelong hobbies of angling and photography. She also became president of the Botanical Society of Scotland, and gave four lectures across Scotland, and remained in contact with colleagues who ran field courses at Perthshire's Kindrogan Field Centre. Cutter died on 23 October 2010 and had no living relatives.

Administratively this range is part of the Sermersooq Municipality.  History  This group of nunataks at the edge of the vast Greenland Ice Sheet was first reported by German aviation pioneer Wolfgang von Gronau during his 1930 transatlantic flight on a Dornier Wal.Gronau, W. von 1933: Im Gr√∂nland-Wal. Dreimal √ºber den Atlantik und einmal um die Welt, 176 pp. Berlin: Reimar Hobbing The existence of the range was later confirmed by Lauge Koch during flights in 1933 that were part of the 1931‚Äì34 Three-year Expedition to East Greenland (Tre√•rsekspeditionen). Following the subsequent survey and mapping of the mountains they were named after Wolfgang von Gronau. Geography The Gronau Nunataks is a long cluster of nunataks. It is located north of the Watkins Range, beyond the large Christian IV Glacier and to the northeast of the Lindbergh Range. The Greenland Ice Sheet lies to the north and the Wager Nunataks further to the east. The Gronau Glacier is located in the western part of the mountains. The area of the range is remote and uninhabited.Google Earth The D√∏demandstoppene (Danish for \\"Mountains of the Dead\\", lit. \\"Peaks of the Dead Men\\") is a geographic division or part of the Gronau Nunataks located on the eastern side of the Gr√∏nlands Styrelse Glacier. The name originated in 1934 at the time of the British Trans-Greenland Expedition by Sir Martin Lindsay in which the dark pyramid or tomb-like mountains were deemed sinister when first seen. Defense Mapping Agency map of Greenland sheet Peaks The highest point of the Gronau Nunataks is a 2,810 m mountain. The area has been explored in recent decades by alpinists and some of the peaks have been named, but data are lacking regarding the exact location of certain peaks.Engel, H. 2007: Gronau Nunatakker, first ascents.

It is 600 km northwest of Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia. Lake Tana is the largest lake in Ethiopia, and is the source of the Blue Nile river. The peninsula is attached to dry land on its western part. As a place name, the word \\"zege\\" signifies a peninsula that encloses two rural qebele, the former monastery and Z√§g√© town at the gate of the main land of the peninsula. At present, Zeg√© is part of Bahir Dar city administration, and is 32 km from the main town, the capital of Amhara National Regional State. The origin of the term \\"zegi√©\\" is somewhat obscure. Informants from Ura Kidane miheret monastic church, one of the earliest church in the peninsula associated the term to Debra Zegag and Abba Nahom; where as some monks who were servants of M√§hal Zegi√© Giyorgis attributed the term to Zengie (my shaft) and to Abun Betre Maryam, founder of Zegie monastery. Still another church scholar, Aleqa Aynakulu Mersha, related the term to a name of a tribe called Zegie (Aleqa Aynekulu) 1955 E.C:466; Tadese Tamrat, 1994:954-959). On the peninsula of Zege there are six Monastic churches, all established between the 14th and 17th centuries. Background A heart shaped Lake and source of Blue Nile Lake Tana is situated in North western Ethiopia in the area between Gonder and Gojjam, to the north of Bahir Dar. It is the largest lake in the country, at 3600 square kilometers. Lake Tana has about 37 islands and hosts about 30 ancient and historic monasteries endowed with precious heritages and ancient books as well as documents. Sources traced the foundation of many of its monasteries back to the 14th century, out of the thirty monastic churches on the islands. On the land around Lake Tana, seven churches were founded in zege peninsula occupies a large land mass pushes the lake from the west in an easterly direction. Among the monasteries of zeghie, mahal zeghie georgies and betre Mariam is believed to be the earliest. It is the earliest monastery in zeghie, because in the hagiography of betre Mariam it is stated the other six churches were established long after the foundation of mehal zege giyorgies. The history of the monasteries of lake and its surroundings is associated with the seven stars the term \\"seven stars\\" refers to the saints who were pioneers it the evangelization of the lake tana region. Thus the Abune Betre Mariam, who was one of the \\"seven stars\\", founded Mehal zege Giyorgies in 1264 E.C(13th C). Many monasteries on this peninsula have a steeple-like structure on the roof; this steeple consists of seven ostrich eggs, which signify the seven stars or seven saints mentioned previously. Monasteries on the Tana islands Debre Maryam Monastery Kebran Gabriel Monastery Debre Maryam The monastery of Debre Maryam is one of the newer monasteries of Lake Tana, having been built by Emperor Tewodros in the 19th century. A friendly priest welcomes all visitors and is happy to show you the ancient manuscripts stored there. It can be accessed by boat and a short walk through coffee, mango and fig trees that line the path. More adventurous travellers can rent a tankwa papyrus boat from locals, 20 minutes on the road towards Gondar, just before the Nile bridge. Dega Estefanos Set on a hill around 100m above the lake, a short trek up a winding path brings you to one of the most sacred monasteries, the monastery of Dega Estefanos. This monastery is of real historic interest, housing brightly coloured ceremonial robes, a 16th-century painting of the Madonna and the mummified remains of five Ethiopian emperors, displayed for visitors to view in modern, glass-sided coffins. Narga Selassie Narga Selassie, which means ‚ÄòTrinity of the Rest‚Äô, was built on Dek Island, the largest island of Lake Tana in the late 18th century. The church is one of the most peaceful and atmospheric on Lake Tana and is set in an extremely beautiful location. Tana Cherkos Tana Cherkos is a small island monastery where it is said the Ark of the Covenant was hidden for 800 years before being brought to its final resting place in Aksum. The shores of the island are covered with a dense forest strip which is home to majestic fish eagles. It takes around three hours to reach this monastery by boat from Bahir Dar. Kebran Gabriel While it is said to be one of the most beautiful and atmospheric of the monasteries of Lake Tana, the church of Kebran Gabriel is no longer open to the public. The monastery was founded in the 14th century and rebuilt in the 17th century. It is located the closest to Bahir Dar. The round roof is supported by twelve pillars made from carved stones symbolising the twelve apostles. Monasteries on the Zege Peninsula The Zege peninsula, which is covered by a dense tropical forest and of mainly by the endemic plant of coffee, is situated to the south west edge of lake Tana some 20 km on land and 15 km on water from the town of Bahir Dar (the capital city of Amhara Regional state of Ethiopia). Monasteries with immense historical and cultural interest history tell us that lake Tana had been serving as a link between Ethiopia and the ancient world the ancient Greek called it as \\"Copper Tinted Lake' or the jewel of Ethiopia' hermits seeking seclusion from the mundane world founded early Ethiopian orthodox Christian monasteries among the shores of Lake Tana and on the different island since the 4th century. Mehal zege saint George monastery is the pioneer among the seven historic and ancient churches on the zeghie peninsula which had been built since the 13th century. Women are not allowed entry to some. Be sure to include zege peninsula (which most do) as there is a monastery with excellent paintings here. The rich forests on the Zege Peninsula are home to many medieval churches waiting for you to visit. The peninsula can easily be reached by boat or bicycle from Bahir Dar. Bete Maryam Bete Maryam Monastery located on the Zege Peninsula not far from Bahir Dar. We chose to stop at Bete Maryam which means \\"the House of Mary\\" first since it is one of the oldest and most spectacular monasteries on the peninsula and is also a short walk from the boat landing. A handful of monasteries are located on the Zege Peninsula meaning they are reachable by both boat and car, however, arriving by boat is much more picturesque and gives you a perspective of the enormous size and beauty of Lake Tana. If I have the chance to visit Bahir Dar again, I‚Äôd opt to take the boat to the Zege Peninsula and spend the day walking to see the seven monasteries spread out through the lush, green forests of the peninsula instead of spending all my time on a boat. Some of the island monasteries do not allow women inside so it is important to research which ones you want to see beforehand. Exterior view of the monastery of Azuwa Maryam on Zege peninsula Azuwa Maryam This round church has a thatched roof which makes it one of the most attractive churches around Lake Tana. Step inside and watch its paintings come alive. Bete Selassie & Tekla Haimanot Just a 45-minute walk uphill from the shore takes you to these two hidden treasures. These two monasteries are slightly off the beaten track, making a trip to see the vivid frescoes inside even more special. Only men are permitted to enter the Bete Selassie monastery due to religious reasons. Saint George Monastery Mehal zege Saint George monastery founded during the 13th century and rebuilt by plastered round wall with conical thatched roof, a typical example of the Ethiopian orthodox church, is found hidden within the mangrove forest of the zeghie peninsula. According to the hagiography (chronicle the founder was Abune Betre Mariam one of the seven stars (Ethiopian saints) who had devoted their entire life in expanding the monasteries on the islands and shores of lake Tana. the aforementioned and its sisterly Abune Betre Mariyam churches possess a spending museum having collection of icons mural paintings crowns crosses, vestments, illuminating manuscripts and others. The museum is known especially for its particular identities of manuscripts known as an iron cloth of the founding saint (Abune Betre Mariam) illuminated manuscripts and other invaluable antiques make the monastery worth.

It is part of the complex of the Convent of Mercy. At least one author considers it the most attractive church in the Lake Tana region. It has been said that the inside of the Ura Kidane Mehret monastery is the most impressive and beautiful in the whole region. Just a 25-minute walk from the boat landing point will take you to the monastery, winding through coffee plantations under tall shady trees. The monastery is highly decorated with beautifully painted, colourful and vibrant frescoes depicting Ethiopian saints and the history of the Ethiopian-Orthodox Church. Both men and women are permitted to enter and there is also a small museum, the Zeghie Satekela Museum, for visitors to learn about hand-crafted objects and musical instruments that are still used by the local communities today. The convent was founded in the 14th century by the saint Betre Mariyam (Amharic \\"Rod of Mary\\"), although the present circular church dates from the 16th century. Its interior is decorated with numerous murals painted between 100 and 250 years ago; subjects include Negus Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam and his followers. The most significant were painted by Alaqa Engida during the reign of Emperor Menelik II.

It is located in the Nanjangud taluk in the district of Mysore. It is famous for the Suttur Mutt which is one of most prominent spiritual centers of India. =Suttur is a village situated on the banks of the River Kapila in Nanjangud taluk, Mysuru district. It is located at a distance of 28 km south of Mysuru (connected by State Highway via Varuna village) and around 170 km from Bengaluru. The shrine of Adi Jagadguru Sri Shivrathreeshwara Shivayogi Mahaswamiji is the main temple at Suttur. Thousands of devotees visit the shrine throughout the year. History Community life in India is closely linked with spiritual and religious institutions for the past five thousand years. The Rishis have been the beacons and guiding forces in upholding the moral values of life and in the progression of society as a whole. The glorious Jagadguru Sri Veerasimhasana Math, popularly known as Sri Suttur Math is a reflection of and testimony to this rich tradition. Jagadguru Sri Veerasimhasana Mahasamsthana Math with a long history of more than one thousand years is a multi-dimensional institution that has contributed immensely to the cause of societal advancement. The welfare activities of the Math transcend the public of all the sections of Indian society. The founding of the Math can be traced to a historical event linked with Sri Shivarathreeshwara Shivayogi Mahaswamiji crusading for peace between two warring kingdoms. The hostility between Rachamalla IV of the Gangas of Talkad and Rajendra of Cholas was about to break up into a large scale war. It was due to the timely intervention of Sri Shivarathreeshwara Swamigalu, the hostility ended and the enemies became friends. Then it was at the request of Rajendra, Mahaswamiji graciously condescended to establish a Math on the banks of the River Kapila at Suttur near Mysuru. The inscriptional pieces of evidence support the establishment of Suttur Math during the reign of Chola kingdom. The name Shivarathri is mentioned in many ancient works. The Shivarathreeshwara Shivayogi Mahaswamiji tradition handed down from one pontiff to another indicates that the said Shivarathreeshwara Shivayogi Mahaswamiji is the founder of the Jagadguru Sri Veersimhasana Math. Sri Eshaneshwara Wodeyar, the second pontiff, was responsible for further development of the Suttur Math during the times of Rajendra Chola. The Someshwara temple near the Math at Suttur is said to have been constructed by the Chola kings, in accordance with the wishes of Sri Eshaneshwara Wodeyar. An inscription referring to this event is dated October 23, 1032. Culture  Suttur mutt  Suttur Mutt has a history of 1,000 years. Suttur Mutt established Jagadguru Sri Shivarathreeswara Mahavidyapeetha (popularly called as JSS Mahavidyapeetha) in 1954. Suttur Mutt runs more than 300 educational institutions in Karnataka and other parts of the country. Some of the institutions are located in North India and outside the country. The present Pontiff Jagadguru Shivarathri Deshikendra Mahaswamiji is the President of Mahavidyapeetha. Jagadguru Sri Veerasimhasana Mahasamsthana Math can most aptly be described as an active ongoing movement to uphold the cause of social and economic justice, based on spiritual values and ideals. The Math's activities at Suttur have spread far and wide beyond the small region on the banks of the River Kapila in Karnataka to touch the lives of millions going beyond the boundaries of our country, and even to the distant shores of the other countries. A quick look at the lineage of the Math brings to light the unwavering societal concern of the Pontiffs. If the founding of the Math was incidental to establishing harmony and peace between the two warring factions of the region by its founder, Sri Shivarathreeshwara Mahaswamiji, the Pontiffs who followed saw purpose in promoting academics, literature, healthcare, infrastructure, etc. The Math philosophy has found expression in the teachings and words of countless saints and seers as well as writers and philosophers. The worship of Shiva means 'tolerance and love to all living beings' and 'regarding work as a means of worship'. The lineage of Suttur Math The Suttur Math region grew up over the centuries with the contribution of each one of its illustrious pontiffs. Each pontiff chose his route to further the advancement of society. The high stature that the Sri Suttur Math enjoys today is thus the cumulative result of their initiatives, efforts and actions. 1.Jagadguru Sri Shivarathreeshwara Shivayogi Mahaswamiji 2.Jagadguru Sri Eeshaneshwara Wodeyar Mahaswamiji 3.Jagadguru Sri Nijalinga Shivacharya Mahaswamiji 4.Jagadguru Sri Siddananja Deshikendra Mahaswamiji 5.Jagadguru Sri Kapininanjunda Deshikendra Mahaswamiji 6.Jagadguru Sri Channaveera Deshikendra Mahaswamiji 7.Jagadguru Sri Siddhamalla Shivacharya Mahaswamiji 8.Jagadguru Sri Parvathendra Shivacharya Mahaswamiji 9.Jagadguru Sri Bhandari Basappa Wodeyar Mahaswamiji 10.Jagadguru Sri Koogaluru Nanjunda Deshikendra Mahaswamiji 11.Jagadguru Sri Ghanalingadeva Mahaswamiji 12.Jagadguru Sri Immadi Shivarathreeshwara Mahaswamiji 13.Jagadguru Sri Channabasava Deshikendra Mahaswamiji 14.Jagadguru Sri Gurunanja Deshikendra Mahaswamiji 15.Jagadguru Sri Guruchannabasa Shivacharya Mahaswamiji 16.Jagadguru Sri Gurupanchakshara Deshikendra Mahaswamiji 17.Jagadguru Sri Chidghana Shivacharya Mahaswamiji 18.Jagadguru Sri Channaveera Deshikendra Mahaswamiji 19.Jagadguru Sri Mahanta Deshikendra Mahaswamiji 20.Jagadguru Sri Siddhamalla Shivacharya Mahaswamiji 21.Jagadguru Sri Shivarathri Dehshikendra Mahaswamiji 22.Jagadguru Sri Mantramaharshi Pattada Sri Shivarathreeshwara Mahaswamiji 23.Jagadguru Dr Sri Shivarathri Rajendra Mahaswamiji 24.Jagadguru Sri Shivarathri Deshikendra Mahaswamiji - Present Pontiff Education * J.S.S.Higher Primary School was established in 1991.

According to the ancestral beliefs, the wearing of earrings separates men from animals. While the tattoos signifies the difference in social rankings. According to them, the more tattoo markings are found on the body meant the higher the social status in the society would be. However, today the tradition of wearing earrings and tattoos are slowly being left out by the younger generation of the Apo Kayan people.

Panattieri was a stigmatic and received visions during her life with one in particular being the French invasion of the Italian peninsula. She served as a catechist to children and was noted for her simple existence. Panattieri was beatified on 26 September 1897 after Pope Leo XII confirmed that there was a longstanding 'cultus' (or popular devotion) to the late religious. Life Maddalena Panattieri was born in Trino in 1443 and as a child fostered a great devotion to Catherine of Siena. She joined the Order of Preachers not long before 1463 as part of the tertiaries rather than as a formal religious; this was considered unusual since members were mainly widows and older women. She made a private vow as a child to remain chaste. Panattieri lived at home alongside her relations and devoted her time to the care of both the poor and the ill and she would often give talks to children (she was quite fond of children) while later speaking with priests and nuns. She would instruct these children in catechism which led to older people flocking to hear her speak on the subject. Panattieri also received the stigmata later in life though kept this a secret. The reform movement of Raymond of Capua of the order saw the religious promote it in Trino. God also revealed to her the coming French invasion of the Italian peninsula though she would not live to see it. She often spent her mornings in Eucharistic Adoration while her afternoons saw her administering to both the ill and the poor; she became noted for her austerities which included wearing a rough woolen shirt and for her long fasts. When her brother kept getting into trouble (and his conduct exceeded all patience) she would fall to her knees before a Crucifix and would beg for God to intervene and help her brother. Through her efforts the order was inspired to undertake a more strict observance which led to Sebastian Maggi - from Milan - coming in 1490 to inaugurate this at her request. On one occasion a rich councilor from Milan - who harbored great hatred towards the faith - was excommunicated and he hit her across the face in public and called her names. She dropped to her knees and said: \\"Brother here is the other cheek. I give it to you in love of Jesus Christ\\" which infuriated the man further. But justice was too late for the man died a violent death from a painful and incurable disease not long after this incident. Panattieri died on 13 October 1503 in Trino. On her deathbed she said: \\"I could not be happy in Heaven if you were not there too\\" to those assembled near her bedside. She sang \\"Jesus our Redeemer\\" and the \\"Ave Maria\\" prior to her death. Her remains were found in 1964 and transferred in 1970. Beatification Panattieri received formal beatification from Pope Leo XII on 26 September 1827 once the pontiff confirmed that a 'cultus' (or popular devotion) to Panattieri existed and endured since her death.

He attended Whitchurch High School in Cardiff, in the same year group as Wales and British Lions captain Sam Warburton and Wales footballer Gareth Bale. Athletic career Morris first became involved in athletics while at school and began competing in 2006. Due to the events caused by the Spanish basketball team at the Sydney Paralympics, Morris' classification was removed from the Summer Games itinerary. T20 athletes were reintroduced for the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, and Morris was selected to represent Great Britain in the 1,500-metre race. There were no heats for the race and the final was held on 4 September in a field of 11 athletes. Morris finished sixth with a time of 4:02.50. His personal best of 3:58.93, that he set two months earlier at the BMC Grand Prix in Stretford, would have been good enough for the silver medal position. In 2013 Morris was again chosen to represent Great Britain, this time at the IPC World Championships in Lyon in the 1,500m (T20), finishing in eighth place. Although Morris did not attend 2014 European Championships, he was selected for the 2016 IPC Athletics European Championships in Grosseto.

In the beginning of the 1920s, gifted with a rare skill in polemics, he was with Nguy·ªÖn Phan Long, one of the best representatives of the progressive native press in French Indochina. Throughout those years, willing to distance himself from those who advocated a direct confrontation against the colonial regime, his attitude evolved toward a more prudent moderation.  Biography  Maurice Henri Eug√®ne Dejean de la B√¢tie was born in Hanoi in 1898. Son of a French diplomat, Marie Joseph Maurice Dejean de la B√¢tie, and a Vietnamese woman, Dang thi Khai, he obtained the acknowledgment of paternity from his father in 1920. He passed his high school degree at the school of Puginier of Hanoi, then went on studying and graduated from the School of Public Works of the University of Hanoi. For a few months, he worked as a land surveyor. Very soon after his military service, he switched fields to become a publicist, a term commonly used at that time.  Beginnings of a career of journalist  Eugene Dejean de la B√¢tie began his career in journalism at the beginning of the twenties in Saigon, Cochinchina. In 1923, he was Editor in Chief of La Voix annamite (The Annamite Voice); it was under this title that he joined the Cochinchinese Press Syndicate which was then presided over by Henry de Chavigny de Lachevroti√®re. In 1924, he was found again at L'√âcho annamite (The Annamite Echo) managed by Nguyen Phan Long. In April 1925, he wrote an article : ¬´Why we don‚Äôt wish for the Annamite people their immediate liberation from the French guardianship¬ª. In this article, Dejean took up a somewhat ambiguous attitude: he rejected the argument of those who justified the French presence by the fact that Vietnam was unable to attain its independence even when it envied its neighbors (China and Japan); but at the same time he thought that the Annamite people needed France to implement its modernization.  Collaboration with Paul Monin and Andr√© Malraux  In June 1925, he became a collaborator of the daily newspaper L'Indochine (The Indochina) created by Paul Monin and Andr√© Malraux. In issue 6 of L'Indochine (dated June 23. 1925) he explained why he left L'√âcho annamite. Clara Malraux related in her Memories that, foreseeing that people could blame him for abandoning the Annamites to the Europeans, without delay he had specified his viewpoint: ¬´for the majority of Annamites, the only name of Monin is a guarantee of the pro‚Äìannamite tendencies of The Indochina newspaper ‚Ä¶ Being neither meat nor fish, I have the noticeable advantage to be of the two at the same time! But my natural inclination rather incites me to lean toward the weak‚Ä¶¬ª Eug√®ne Dejean de la B√¢tie participated actively in the struggle led by Monin and Malraux for the grant of democratic rights to natives: freedom of movement, of meeting, of expression, with authorization of a free press in Vietnamese. The friendship of Dejean and of Malraux is illustrated by the following anecdote, which stemmed from a disagreement of the team at L'Indochine with Le Quang Trinh, the director of Le progr√®s annamite (The Annamite Progress), a newspaper supported by the colonial administration. Le progr√®s annamite relates in its own way the unexpected visit to Mr. Le Quang Trinh by Mr. Malraux accompanied by Mr Dejean de la B√¢tie following the article containing offensive insinuations toward the ruling class of Indochina: ¬´Very pleasantly, Le Quang Trinh held out his hand to Mr. Malraux. The latter, while introducing himself, took care not to shake it. With a pale face and tight lips, Mr. Malraux threatened the worst retaliations if I began to talk again in my newspaper of any bas-relief. According to Le Quang Trinh who calmly but sharply replied to Mr. Malraux, the effect of his speech have been crushing: ‚Äúthe hot tempered gentleman had disappeared followed by his faithful squire [Dejean]‚Äù. And Nguyen Phan Long, author of the article goes on saying facetiously: ¬´We didn‚Äôt know that Mr Le Quang Trinh had such a chastised eloquence and with such a crushing efficacity¬ª. Nevertheless, noting the disagreement which appeared between Monin and Malraux, Dejean de la B√¢tie left L'Indochine. Together with his friend Nguy·ªÖn An Ninh, they began to republish La Cloche f√™l√©e (The Cracked Bell), which had ceased to exist in June 1924. The two men then offered its management to Phan Van Truong, a lawyer of French citizenship, who had been a companion of the future H√¥ Chi Minh in Paris in the early twenties. During that time Dejean de la B√¢tie approved and supported the nationalist aspirations of his Vietnamese compatriots.  Distancing from the Vietnamese nationalists and communists  For many months, Dejean supplied written materials to La Cloche f√™l√©e without however giving up writing for L'√âcho annamite. After the arrest of Nguyen An Ninh in April 1926 (accused of anti French activities), La Cloche f√™l√©e was closed. Eug√®ne Dejean de la B√¢tie created a new newspaper with Phan Van Truong, L'Annam, which tone would be even more offensive to the colonial administration than that of La Cloche f√™l√©e. But then Dejean had a disagreement with Phan Van Truong over one of their collaborators, Nguyen Pho, whom Truong thought to be an informant of the Security. Dejean was convinced that Nguyen Pho was not a traitor, but was unable to make Truong share his belief. Becoming the director of L'√âcho annamite, Dejean de la B√¢tie developed essays which led him to clearly condemn the communist positions. A few months before the closing of the publication of the daily paper, in 1931, he was injured in a road accident. A rumor spread out in Saigon that he was the victim of a communist attempt. Eug√®ne replied with his usual humor: ‚Äú I would have been a victim of a blow from an axe. Why not one from a sickle or a hammer?‚Äù In the 1930s, Dejean de la B√¢tie, joined the socialists of Indochina and contributed to their daily newspaper, Le Populaire (The Popular). A few years later, he was found again in the newspaper L'Alerte (Alert), under the direction of a Mr. Fauquenot who turned out to be a spy in the service of the Japanese. Dejean de la B√¢tie was not compromised in this affair, but L'Alerte could not survive this torment. In 1938, Dejean de la B√¢tie contributed to the rebirth of The Annamite Echo which stopped being published in April 1931. However, in the early 1940s, he was forced to accept that the content of his newspaper L'√âcho annamite, be submitted to censorship by the petainist regime of Admiral Decoux, for which he would be blamed at the end of the war. Eug√®ne Dejean de la B√¢tie died of illness, in Saigon on December 31. 1946, at the age of forty eight.  Bibliography Clara Malraux, Le Bruit des nos pas, Les Combats et les jeux, Grasset, 1969, .

Roggeri received his beatification from Pope Gregory XVI in 1841 after the pontiff confirmed that there was a significant 'cultus' (or popular and longstanding devotion) to the late tradesman. Life Teobaldo Roggeri was born in the Ligurian region to nobles from Piedmont in 1100. The careful reading and attentiveness to the Gospel caused him to abandon his noble status in favor of a simple and austere life. He was orphaned of both his parents during his childhood so set off for Alba in 1112 where he became an apprentice to a shoemaker. Roggeri worked as a cobbler and proved to be quite skilled in his trade which prompted the master to hope in vain that Roggeri would wed his daughter Virida and continue the business after his death; however the apprentice instead made a private vow to remain chaste. He also worked as a porter and spent time transporting sacks of grain from place to place as part of his job. His master died in 1122 after a decade of working with Roggeri. This prompted Roggeri to embark on a solemn pilgrimage - with a bundle and a staff - to the Santiago de Compostela Cathedral in Spain and he later returned to Alba to resume his work. He used his meager income to help the poor of his region and he often slept outside the local church. On one occasion the owner of the shoe store where he worked asked that he take a sack of wheat to the mill to be ground into flour. He agreed but gave handful after handful to the poor people that he encountered along the path to the point where no more wheat remained. He lacked the courage to face the woman back at the store and refused to go back without something to return so he filled the bag with sand and left it on the woman's doorstep before running off. The woman found flour in the bag though later learned of what had happened. This began the tale of the so-called \\"Miracle of the Flour\\" and happened not long before his death. Roggeri died in 1150 after contracting a serious illness while visiting the widow of a cobbler. Per his request he was buried in an unmarked patch of ground between the two churches of San Lorenzo and San Silvestro. His grave became a place of pilgrimage and miracles. After several decades his grave grew obscure and became lost. His remains were rediscovered late in the evening of 21 January 1429 by the Bishop of Alba Alerino Rambaudi; the legend is that the church bells rang out on their own at sunrise on 1 February 1429 in celebration of the find. His remains are now enshrined in the Alba Cathedral. Beatification The confirmation of the 'cultus' (or popular devotion and following) of the late Roggeri in 1841 acted as the formal conferral of beatification from Pope Gregory XVI.

Originally a studio only project, after a few months of writing and recording, the band decided to perform live shows. Wanting to perform in a style and musical direction different from their other projects, The 2930s perform a mix of roots based garage rock and roll, with a touch of indie pop.  Band history  The band was formed in 2009 in Berlin by Guss Brooks and The Josh when there was a break in The BossHoss touring schedule. The band started with the concept of a studio/recording project, with The Stig performing the drums. As all 3 members were performing already in bands with either county, blues, rockabilly or classic rock and roll music direction, the band decided to write songs in a heavier, punk, garage or indie direction. The original rehearsals and song writing took place in Dresden, Germany in late 2009 and the band quickly had enough material to perform live, and decided that as well as recording, they would perform live, in between the schedules of their other projects. Their first recording sessions begun in November 2009 at Sonnenstudio, Berlin. Their first live show was at Rosis Am√ºsierlokal in Dresden on the 29 and 30 December 2009. In March 2010 The 2930s performed support for The BossHoss at the Alte Schlachthof in Dresden. In June 2010 The 2930s finished their first release. A limited edition self-release E.P. \\"The Ride\\", with 6 original songs all recorded at Sonnenstudio/Internashville Recordings in Berlin. With the success of The BossHoss, Guss Brooks schedule was again quiet full, and so recording and song writing time was very limited. However, eventually in 2014 the band could release their first full-length CD \\"Reaching The Highs / Touching The Lows\\". After the release of \\"Reaching The Highs / Touching The Lows\\" The Josh built his own studio in Dresden \\"Catalina Music\\" and continued to write and record for their 3rd release. With the help of their close connection to Alec \\"Boss‚Äú V√∂lkel, Sascha \\"Hoss‚Äú Vollmer, The 2930s released their 2nd CD \\"Tell Me I'm Crazy\\" on The BossHoss new record label \\"Internashville Recordings\\" and performed support shows with The BossHoss during their Dos Bros Tour in April 2016.http://www.thebosshoss.com/2016/03/04/the-2930s-als-support-auf-der-dos- bros-tour/http://rockabilly-pinup.de/allgemein/the-2930s-record-release-unter- bosshoss-label-internashville http://internashville.com/2016/02/02/tell-me-im- crazy-der-erste-release-von-internashville-recordings/ In late 2017, The 2930s released \\"Drive\\", again on The BossHoss label Internashville Recordings.

He is an entrepreneur, industrialist and a businessman. Podhorzer was the CEO of Tempo Beverages, founded and owned \\"Neviot\\" (mineral water) and is very involved in real estate in the United States and Europe.  Biography  Podhorzer was born in Israel. He is the son of Sarah and the attorney Yehuda Aryeh Podhorzer. Podhorzer is married to Bilha, the daughter of industrialist Moshe Bornstein, the founder and owner of Tempo. After his military service, he studied economics and business administration at Bar-Ilan University and at the same time studied law at the University of Tel Aviv and received his law degree 1972. Toward the end of his studies and upon obtaining his lawyer's license, Podhorzer joined \\"Tempo\\" Industries Ltd. and served as the company's CEO for nearly 20 years until the early 1990s. At \\"Tempo\\" Podhorzer led a number of strategic and innovative moves that significantly affected the company and the Israeli food and beverage market in general. Tempo, under Podhorzer's management, was the first to introduce to the Israeli market the PET-bottled soft drinks instead of the glass bottles that were customary at the time by all soft drink companies. In addition, during this period Tempo became \\"Tempo Beer Industries Ltd\\" after acquisition of the only beer company in Israel. Also during those years, Tempo began producing and marketing Pepsi Cola, which brought about an \\"earthquake\\" in the beverage market in Israel. Tempo was chosen by the Dutch company \\"Heineken\\" and became Heineken's representative in Israel. In 1989 ‚Äì Podhorzer initiated, established, and privately owned the \\"Neviot\\" company (mineral water), which within a short time managed to hold 50% of the market shares in Israel. After only three years from its establishment, in 1992, it was issued on the Israeli Stock Exchange. Since then, \\"Neviot\\" has gained an excellent reputation and is a leading brand, all this due to Podhorzer's reputation and proven management and marketing skills in the food and beverages industry. In 2000 ‚Äì Podhorzer added the \\"Coca-Cola\\" company as a partner, having Coca-Cola acquire 40% of Neviot's stock. Podhorzer continued to serve as the company's chairman of the board. Following this agreement, \\"Coca-Cola\\" became the distributor for Neviot bottles while \\"Neviot\\" distributed its own home water containers. \\"In 2003 ‚Äì Podhorzer sold 45% of Tempo's stock held by him and his wife to other partners in the company. In 2005 ‚Äì Podhorzer sold the remaining shares of Neviot to Coca-Cola and left the soft drink industry. That year, he was awarded the Kiryat Shmona City Notable, along with Shlomo Nehama who was the Chairman of the Board of Hapoalim bank at that time and Eli Horowitz, founder and CEO of Teva. During those years, he began to engage in the field of real estate development in Spain and Cyprus, where he established projects for the construction of hundreds of resort units. In the United States and Europe, Podhorzer continues to invest in real estate by \\"Podhorzer Holdings Ltd.\\" Additional investments are made through his other company investment arm, P.I.M. ‚Äì Podhorzer Investment & Management Ltd. P.I.M examines companies that require a \\"change of direction\\" and invests in them.

Granby is a sans-serif typeface designed and released by the Stephenson Blake type foundry of Sheffield from 1930. Granby is influenced by a contemporary British sans-serif design, the Johnston typeface or Railway Alphabet (1916), the proprietary face of what became London Underground. Roy Millington's history of Stephenson Blake also cites Futura as an influence. Like both Johnston and Gill Sans, Granby has an upper-case influenced by Roman square capitals and a lower-case inspired by traditional \\"old-style\\" serif letters, making it an example of what is now called the humanist style of sans-serif fonts. Granby‚Äôs regular style is a robust design bolder than conventional body text fonts, making it suitable for headings and posters and also for legible text at smaller sizes. Stephenson Blake had prepared type for the Johnston project and Granby is almost identical in many ways, more like Johnston than Gill Sans with diamond-shaped dots (tittles) on the 'i' and 'j' and a wide ‚Äòa‚Äô. A difference is its ‚Äòg‚Äô, a ‚Äòsingle-storey‚Äô design influenced by handwriting. According to Mike Ashworth of Transport for London, London Transport itself made some use of Granby by the 1960s due to the limited availability of Johnston type. Granby Elephant compared to Monotype's Gill Kayo, also called Gill Sans Ultra Bold. Several styles of Granby were released to extend the design, including condensed weights, an inlined style and 'Granby Elephant', an ultra-bold design. As with many sans-serifs, rather than a true italic, an oblique was offered, in which the letters were slanted but not altered to take on more handwriting influences. While never as popular as Gill Sans on the commercial market, Granby nonetheless remained in use with revivals in phototypesetting and digital versions. A digitisation of some weights is sold by Elsner+Flake and Scangraphic; Red Rooster Fonts has also digitised the Elephant style. It was appropriately used in adverts by the London company Granby Cycles in the 1930s. Wayfarer, by Jeremy Tankard, is a loose revival of the condensed style, commissioned by Sheffield City Council as their corporate font based on its local heritage. (It also has some influences of Stephenson Blake's well-known Grotesque series.)

After Laycock died in 1916 the business passed through the hands of Charron, a French automobile manufacturer, into receivership from where it was bought by Sheffield engineer and shipbreaker Thos W Ward. Laycock was bought from Ward by a group of investors and put into the ownership of a new holding company, Birfield Limited, along with Hardy Spicer. Both Laycock and Hardy Spicer made transmission or driveline components for the automotive industry. In 1966 Birfield, with Laycock and Hardy Spicer, were bought by the GKN group which was entering the automotive components field following government's announcement of the intended nationalisation of its GKN Steel. Products Laycock's initial business was the manufacture of railway carriage and steamship fittings and underframe gear for railway coaches and locomotives.

He was a humanist known for his writings, notably his book on the military horse, and his reorganisation of the Ijevsk arms factory, the manufacture of Berdanka carbines, and the creation of the no 4 line carbine. He founded the Tsaritsin refinery with Robert Nobel and the Branobel oil company in Baku with Ludwig Nobel. Finally, he established an agricultural and meteorological station in Zapolie, where he invented the ros√©om√®tre, an instrument for measuring the dew point. He was the brother of Baron Alexandre von Bilderling, the general who participated in the Russo- Japanese War.  Biography  Peter von Bilderling was born to a noble Baltic German family from the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia. His father, Alexandre Otto Hermann Grigori√©vitch von Bilderling, was a lieutenant-general in the Engineering Corps. His grandfather, Georges Sigismond von Bilterlings, (1767‚Äì1829), was a Lutheran pastor in Mitau, Courland, today known as Jelgava, Latvia. He was a professor, theologian, philosopher and writer. His mother came from an untitled family of the Polish nobility, the Doliwo-Dobrowolski. Peter von Bilderling was born in Saint Petersburg on May 26, 1844, and died the 25th of September 1900 at his Zapolie property near Louga, where he is buried. He left the Corps of Pages as a major with honors in 1861, then the Michel artillery academy in the first rank. He was attached to the Uhlan regiment of the guards of Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1831‚Äì1891). He was an aide de camp to General Kartzof in the Caucasus. In 1870, he was sent on a mission by the Imperial government to Great Britain and the United States to study gun manufacture. He married twice: * Sofia Vladimirovna Westmann 1853‚Äì1914 * Natalia Alexandrovna Barantzov 1885‚Äì1981. Her descendants now live on the C√¥te d'Azur in Cannes and Nice.  Ijevsk weapons factory  With an imperial government lease, he and Baron Standertskj√∂ld, directed and reorganised the Ijevsk weapons factory from 1871 to l879 to require only domestic raw materials. In 1872, he signed an agreement with Ludvig Nobel, who furnished the machine tools. Under his direction, more than 400,000 Berdanka guns were produced. He created the #4 line carbine. A telegraph office opened at the factory. The factory was re- supplied by rail. It was during these years (with production starting of the Berdan rifle) that the division of labour and machine tool production of gun mechanism components came into its own. The Kalashnikov was invented and manufactured at Ijevsk. The carbine #4 underwent a baptism of fire during the Russo-Turk War. Von Bilderling personally visited the front to evaluate of the effectiveness of this weapon. He was later awarded the right to bear the arms of St George for his actions on the Danube. Wounded in the leg and head, he joined the reserve corps in September 1880.  BRANOBEL, Baku oil company  Instead of using his time and the assets of his mission to find raw materials for the Ijevsk factory, in 1876 Robert Nobel used the 25,000 rubles he had to buy an oil refinery in Tsaritsyne, now known as Volgograd. He saw the refinery as an investment with a great future. A total of 450,000 rubles were invested in BRANOBEL. Peter von Bilderling put in 300,000 and Baron Standertskj√∂ld 150,000. The business began to show a profit. Ludwig Nobel convinced his older brother Robert in May 1879 to set up a company, the \\"Tovarichtchestvo Nephtanavo Pro√Øsvodtsva Bratiev Nobel\\" (Nobel Brothers Oil Production Company), named BRANOBEL in telegraph communications, and soon, simply NOBEL. Peter von Bilderling remained president of its administrative council until he died in 1900. The capital of the business founded in St Petersburg (3 million rubles in 600 shares of 5000 rubles each) was held as follows: *Ludwig Nobel...........................1 610 000 *Baron Peter von Bilderling........930 000 *Alfred Nobel..........................115 000 *Robert Nobel...........................100 000 *I.J. Zabelsky..........................135 000 *Baron Alexandre von Bilderling.....50 000 *Fritz Blumberg..........................25 000 *Michel Beliamin.........................25 000 *A.S. Sundgren............................5 000 *Benno Wunderlich.........................5 000 This 3-million-ruble capitalization was followed by another million rubles en 1880, 2 million and 4 million in 1881 and finally 5 million en 1884 (in 250-rubles shares to allow investors to multiply). BRANOBEL was, at the end of the 19th century, one of the biggest oil companies in the world. Pipeline technology for oil transportation was perfected near Baku by Vladimir Shukhov and Branobel in the years 1878‚Äì1880. Of the money bequeathed by Alfred Nobel to establish the Nobel Prize, 12% came from his shares in BRANOBEL. At that point he was its biggest individual investor. Bolsheviks took Baku on April 28, 1920, and nationalized BRANOBEL.  Agriculture, meteorology in Zapolie  Around 1881, after much searching in Courland, he bought from a property from General Borivoje Mirkoviƒá, a property of 400 mas de Zapolie et de 490 mas de Boussany (Luga District, Saint- Petersburg). In 1889, he organised and became very interested in the model agricultural station in Zapolie with a special meteorology station, reputed even abroad. After completely organizing the work, he turned these stations over to the minister of agriculture.  Family  Armes Buldring Bilderling Peter von Bilderling's family was originally from Westphalia. In 1350 Otbert Boldring owned the fiefs of Cotwik and Overdik in Raalte parish and were notable members of the Hanseatic League. One branch of the family came from the Baltic countries with Johan Buldrink, in Courland, who became the vassal of the Teutonic Order when he received a fief near Riga named Bilderlingshof from Wolter von Plettenberg, the grand master of the Order. Between the 17th century and 1940 (currently Bulduri). Hermann von Bilderling had his family entered in the Nobiliaire de Courlande in 1634 (first class) and is cited in the Baltic genealogical literature as Uradel (noblesse imm√©moriale). The branch of Peter von Bilderling came through Livonia with Friedrich, grandson of Johan, and the fiefs of Karrinem and Taifer, then Lithuania with Johan then Melchior and the fief of Miszany. The family's title of baron was recognized in the Russian Nobiliaire through an edict of the Imperial Senate in 1903. The family arms are: D'argent √† une aigle de sable, langu√©e de gueules, la poitrine d'argent bearing a green poplar. Cimier un peuplier arrach√© de sinople entre un vol de sable √† dextre et d'argent √† s√©nestre. Sable lambrequins doubl√© d'argent.Carl Arvid von Klingspor : Baltisches Wappenbuch.

It is Hungary‚Äôs highest altitude terroir. Based on its unique location, soil composition and climate, it is the most valuable terroir in the region. It is Eger‚Äôs Grand Cru terroir.  Location  The most important terroir of the Eger Wine Region is the Nagy- Eged Hill (in English Great Eged Hill), which is located in the southern foothills of the B√ºkk Mountains. Its peak is at 536 meters. Unlike the major part of the Wine Region, its soil is not rhyolite, but gray Triassic-limestone with calcareous based sediments. The Eged Hill ridge lies in the south-west to north-east. The lower parts are called the Nagy-Eged terroir (Nagy-Eged-d≈±l≈ë); the upper part is called the Nagy-Eged Hill terroir (Nagy-Eged-hegy-d≈±l≈ë). The former is up to cca 250 meters of altitude, and almost completely occupies the southwest side of the hill. The best performing terroir, the Nagy-Eged Hill is above 250 meters, at the steepest parts terraces were formed.  Climate and soil  The Eger Wine Region has a cooler climate, which is similar to Burgundy or to the Northern Rh√¥ne wine regions. As a result of the continental climate and diverse soil composition it is possible to produce both red and white varietals. The Eged Hill is the place where the warmth of the Plains meets the cool air of the B√ºkk Mountains, forming a special microclimate. Due to its exposure and the slope angle of the hill, spring comes early. The surface helps the dispersion of the sun rays and increases the heat both in the air and the soil. Due to the specific climate and environment many rare plants and animal species can be found here. The most typical soil is the rendzina (a dark, grayish-brown, humus-rich, intrazonal soil) and the brown forest soil. Annual average temperatures: 10 degrees Celsius (in the vegetation season: 17 ¬∞C; the temperature goes above 25 ¬∞C more than a hundred days a year) Total annual sunshine: 2100 hours Annual rainfall: 540‚Äì550 mm. The rain runs smoothly down the mountain because the shallow, dry soil does not absorb much water. As a result, many sub-Mediterranean species live here.  The effect of the terroir on the grapes  The Nagy-Eged Hill is a Grand Cru terroir, where premium Grand Superior wines are produced. The surface of the soil is almost perpendicular to the arriving rays of the sun; part of these rays are reflected back from the white or gray limestone rocks, thus the near-surface air is extremely hot, which ensures the optimum ripening of the grapes. In the marl dotted soil of the limestone mountains, the roots of the vine stretch down to 10 meters trying to find water. The gray limestone subsoil contributes to the delicate acid structure of the wines as well as to its longevity.  Wineries in the Nagy-Eged Hill   Gr√≥f Buttler Winery  The winery started in 2001 to revive the 18-hectare area of the emblematic, yet completely neglected, weedy habitat. First, they built a two- kilometer-long wall, and in April 2003, they started the plantation. Grape Varieties: Viognier, Pinot blanc, Chardonnay, Kadarka, K√©kfrankos, Syrah, Merlot, Pinot noir, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon  Kov√°cs Nimr√≥d Winery  Kov√°cs Nimr√≥d Winery has a 10 hectare vineyard lying on the top right corner of the Nagy-Eged Hill. They planted the vines in 2005. Their Grand Cru wines come from this terroir. Grape Varieties: Furmint, K√©kfrankos, Pinot noir, Syrah, Cabernet Franc, Merlot  St. Andrea Winery  St. Andrea Winery owns 4 hectares in the lower part of the Nagy-Eged Hill.

After showing some promise as a juvenile he improved to become a leading handicapper in 1988, winning two races and being placed in the Old Newton Cup, Magnet Cup and Cambridgeshire Handicap. He was also involved in a bizarre incident at Royal Ascot in which his unseated his jockey after being allegedly stunned by an \\"ultrasonic gun\\". He reached his peak as a four-year-old in 1989 when he won the Tattersalls Rogers Gold Cup in Ireland before recording an upset victory in the International Stakes. In the same year he also finished second in the Coronation Cup and third in the Champion Stakes. He won one minor race in 1990 and returned after a lengthy absence to race six times without success in 1992. Background Ile de Chypre was a \\"strong, rangy, attractive\\" bay horse with no white markings bred in England by his owner Athos Christodoulou. His sire, Ile de Bourbon, was a top-class middle-distance performer best known for his win in the 1978 King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. As a breeding stallion he also sired The Derby winner Kahyasi before being exported to Japan. Ile de Chypre's dam Salamina showed some ability as a racehorse, winning three of her nine races in Britain in 1980 and 1981. She was descended from the American broodmare Galaday, making her a distant relative of Galatea and Never Say Die. Christodoulou sent the colt into training with Guy Harwood at Pulborough in West Sussex. At the time, Harwood was noted for his modern approach to training, introducing Britain to features such as artificial gallops and barn-style stabling. Racing career 1987: two-year-old season After finishing unplaced over seven furlongs on his racecourse debut, Ile de Chypre finished second to Highbrow in a sixteen-runner maiden race over one mile at Newmarket Racecourse in October. The independent Timeform organisation commented \\"will be suited by 1¬ºm+: sure to win a race\\". 1988: three-year-old season After finishing second in the April Maiden Stakes on his three-year-old debut over one and a half miles, Ile de Chypre was sent to Royal Ascot to contest the King George V Stakes over the same distance on 16 June. He led from the start and looked likely to win before swerving abruptly to the left inside the final furlong and unseating his jockey Greville Starkey. It was later claimed that the horse had been targeted by an \\"ultrasonic gun\\" as part of a money laundering operation by a cocaine-smuggling syndicate. In a trial at Southwark Crown Court in 1989 a car dealer named James Laming claimed that he had carried out the operation and that the device had been disguised as a pair of binoculars but was somewhat vague regarding the details. He continued to compete in major handicap races, finishing second in the Old Newton Cup at Haydock Park and third in the John Smith's Magnet Cup at York before being dropped back in class and recording his first success as he won a maiden race at Newbury Racecourse on 12 August by ten lengths. In September he finished unplaced in the Garrowby Limited Handicap at York and then won sixteen-runner a handicap at Newbury, beating Quinlan Terry by three lengths. On his final appearance o the season he carried top weight of 134 pounds in the Cambridgeshire Handicap on 1 October. He led for most of the way but was caught in the final strides and beaten a neck by Quinlan Terry who was carrying 117 pounds. 1989: four-year-old season Ile de Chypre began his third season by finishing unplaced when carrying top weight in the Lincoln and then ran second under 140 pounds in a handicap at Newmarket. He was then stepped up in class and sent to Ireland to contest the Group Two Tattersalls Rogers Gold Cup at the Curragh on 20 May. Ridden by the Welsh jockey Tony Clark he started at odds of 7/1 behind Executive Perk (Mooresbridge Stakes), Per Quod (runner-up in the Gordon Richards Stakes) and Carroll House. He recorded his biggest win up to that time as he won by three lengths from Executive Perk with Carroll House a length and a half back in third. At Epsom in June Ile de Chypre was promoted to Group One class for the Coronation Cup and took the lead a furlong out before being overtaken and beaten half a length by the favourite Sheriff's Star. The horse was dropped back in class and distance for the Group Three Scottish Classic over ten furlongs at Ayr Racecourse and was beaten by the three-year-old Scenic. On 22 August Ile de Chypre was ridden by Clark when he was one of seven runners to contest the 18th running of the International Stakes over ten and a half furlongs at York. Cacoethes, also trained by Guy Harwood was made the 2/5 favourite after finishing rthird to Nashwan in The Derby and second to the same horse in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, whilst Ile de Chypre was a relative outsider on 16/1. The other five runners were Two Timing (Prince of Wales's Stakes), Magic Gleam (Child Stakes), Shady Heights, Batshoof and Lapierre (Prix Jean Prat). After tracking the leader Two Timing in the early stages Clark sent Ile de Chypre into the lead three furlongs from the finish and accelerated clear of the field. Cacoethes emerged as his only challenger but Ile de Chypre stayed on strongly to win by one and a half lengths with a gap of four lengths back to Shady Heights in third. On his retirement from race riding in 2004 Clark said \\"Ile de Chypre was a horse who took a lot of knowing but he was very game and I don't think he got the credit he deserved - he was a great favourite\\". After a break of two months, Ile de Chypre returned to the track in the Champion Stakes at Newmarket on 21 October. Ridden by Willie Carson he led for most of the way before being caught in the final strides and finishing third, beaten a head and short head by Legal Case and Dolpour in a three-way photo finish. Ile de Chypre ended his season with a trip to the United States for the Breeders' Cup Turf at Gulfstream Park on 4 November in which he finished unplaced behind Prized. 1990: five-year-old season On his first appearance in 1990, Ile de Chypre finished second by a neck to Dolpour in the Gordon Richards Stakes at Sandown Park Racecourse in April. Four weeks later he was sent to France and finished sixth of the nine runners behind Creator in the Prix d'Ispahan. In the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown in July he led for most of the way before being outpaced in the closing stages and finishing third behind Elmaamul and Terimon. After a break of three months Ile de Chypre returned in a minor race at Warwick Racecourse in October. Starting at odds of 1/6 he won by a length from Riviera Magic. 1992: seven-year-old season Ile de Chypre missed the whole of the 1991 season before returning as a seven-year-old in 1992. In April he finished third in the Magnolia Stakes at Kempton Park Racecourse and then finished unplaced in the Gordon Richards Stakes. In the summer of 1992 he finished fourth in the Scottish Classic and third in a handicap at York. In his last two starts he finished fifth in the September Stakes and unplaced in a handicap at Newbury. Stud record Ile de Chypre was retired to stud but attracted little interest from breeders. He sired a few minor winners under National Hunt rules.

The episode is based on Slender Man but is renamed \\"Glasgowman\\". The episode is a Halloween episode, loosely based on the Slender Man stabbings. It received mixed reviews after its release where it was even compared to The Blair Witch Project. Despite being credited, main character Fin Tutuola does not appear in this episode. Plot The episode starts with a girl, Zoe Harris, being scared by her sister, Mia Harris, and Mia's friend, Perry Gilbert. One of the girls is recording a video blog of finding something called \\"Glasgowman\\" they enter a park to search for Glasgowman. Zoe tells her sister she's scared but is ignored. In the morning, Zoe is found in the park with multiple stab wounds by a bird watcher. Amanda Rollins and Carisi respond to the call. Rollins travels in the ambulance with the girl while Carisi interviews the bird watcher. At the hospital, Rollins shows the bird watcher's photos of the suspect to Nick Amaro. Zoe's mothers arrive at the hospital and hound Amaro and Rollins for answers. Amaro calls Olivia Benson, who's home with her son on her day off, in on the case. Later on, once inside the Gilbert residence, the detectives discover that the girls had abandoned their phones. Zoe is then questioned, but her mothers don't take well to the questions the detectives are asking her. The police soon find the person that people believe to be Glasgowman, whose actual name is Charlie Dorsey, and find that he is just a homeless man with a mental illness. Carisi manages to bond with Charlie and they find that he isn't guilty for the crimes of which he has been accused. They soon learn that one of Perry's babysitters told the girls the story of Glasgowman. When interrogating the babysitter, they learn that he has made a make-believe map which is like the park where Zoe was found. They soon find Perry and Mia in an abandoned boathouse upriver from the city. At the hospital, the doctor informs detectives that Perry's wounds were self- inflicted. The detectives then look into the possibility that it was Perry who hurt Zoe. ADA Pippa Cox comes to prosecute Perry as a child in Family Court. The judge sentences Mia to the custody of her mothers with a recommendation for weekly psychiatric care. Perry is labeled a juvenile delinquent and remanded to a psychiatric hospital. Production Oona Laurence portrays the victim in this episode It was announced that Oona Laurence, Chloe Csengery and Mina Sundwall would be guest starring as Zoe Harris, Perry Gilbert and Mia Harris respectively. Reception Anne Easton of The Observer wrote \\"On the heels of Halloween, the spookiest time of the year, SVU presents an episode that's part Blair Witch Project, part Slender Man homage. Much like the plot of Blair Witch, 'Glasgowman's Wrath' features three youngsters heading into the woods on a quest to capture a video image of an illusive figure; in this case it's three girls on a quest to see the supposedly iconic Glasgowman.\\" Easton went on to state \\"While maybe a bit unoriginal in plotting, this episode was still adequately spooky and disturbing, particularly with regard to the violent actions carried out by the youngsters.\\" Easton finished her review with \\"On the surface, this episode of SVU may seem like a simple tale of young girl's devotion gone awry, but once again it's the undercurrent of the installment, filled with various incarnations of complicated issues, the main one of which seems to be who do you trust and at what level, that make this a satisfying episode.\\" Bill Bodkin of Pop-Break gave the episode an 8 out of 10 rating and stated \\"'Glasgowman's Wrath,' despite the awful name, is a terrifically acted, tense and well thought out episode.\\" Jennifer Gerson Uffalussy of The Guardian said \\"It is an episode beautifully aware of its own narrative devices, using its storytelling prowess to call attention to our cultural lust for violence and our deliberate repression of the fact that the greatest evils may not take our forms of choice.\\" Narsimha Chintaluri of TV Fanatic wrote \\"Overall, tonight's episode was seasonal rather than topical but the twisted tale of these little girls' delusions proved to be an entertaining hour.\\" Gabi Quinn of The Eagle called the final scene \\"chilling\\", she also called Will Harris one of the better guest stars of this season of Law & Order: SVU.

At the time it debuted, only track events were held: club throw, javelin throw, pentathlon (for male athletes) precision club throw and shot put which held between men and women. They were held between three classes per event: class A, B and C. The first multi- medallist Maria Scutti from Italy won almost all events for women by gaining nine gold medals and made her team top the medal table. In the 1964 Summer Paralympics, track events were featured for the first for only wheelchair competitors where 60m and 100m (for male competitors) races were in place as well as 4x40m relay race.

Since its founding in 1994 Sherri Young has been its Executive Director and in 2009 L. Peter Callender joined as its Artistic Director. AASC is a member of the Shakespeare Theatre Association.  History  Sherri Young, a graduate of the American Conservatory Theater's Master of Fine Arts Program in 1992, believed there was a problem with theatre companies and color-blind casting as well as the \\"expectation that they [actors of color] would stick to 'black plays' when they graduated\\". Young thought this was \\"inconceivable and unacceptable\\" which motivated her to create the African-American Shakespeare Company to provide opportunities for actors of color in mastering classical theatre. Sherri Young is on the board of Handful Players, a children's musical theatre, and was previously Commissioner for the San Francisco Arts Commission where she was appointed by Gavin Newsom. L. Peter Callender joined the company as its Artistic Director in 2009. Callender was trained at The Juillard School in New York, Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art in England, and Tadashi Suzuki Company of Toga in Japan. He has been an Associate Artist at California Shakespeare Theater for over 20 years and has appeared in productions by Marin Theatre Company, Berkeley Repertory Theatre, and Aurora Theatre Company. Callender is also a Visiting Instructor at Stanford University and has been nominated for and won numerous awards: Helen Hayes Award Nominations: Best Actor ‚Äî Playboy of the West Indies, and Oak and Ivy; New York Audelco Award ‚ÄîBlack Eagles; Audience Award: Best Actor ‚Äî Master Harold‚Ä¶and the Boys, Bay Area Critics Award: Best Actor ‚Äì (World Music), East Bay Express: Best Actor of the East Bay, Several Dean Goodman Awards: Outstanding Lead Actor: Twelfth Night, Cymbeline, Saint Joan, and others.  Location  AASC is a resident organization at the city-owned African American Art and Culture Complex (AAACC) with its office located at 762 Fulton Street Suite 306 in San Francisco, California, 94102. Since 2002, it has staged its productions at the 200-seat Buriel Clay Theater located on the ground floor of the AAACC building with an annual audience of over 7,500 patrons. However, for its 2016‚Äì17 season, it has moved its productions from the Buriel Clay Theater to the San Francisco War Memorial and Performing Arts Center's Herbst Theatre for Cinderella, Marines' Memorial Theatre for August Wilson's Jitney, and San Francisco Opera's Taube Atrium Theatre for William Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale. Callender states the reason for the move was due to \\"the business operations model of the Complex has changed under the new leadership, which has made it increasingly difficult to produce our works. The leadership has reduced our rehearsal time, tech time, and preview times.\\"  Productions  Its signature production of the classic Cinderella fairytale is an annual holiday tradition. In addition to Cinderella, AASC typically produces two Shakespearean plays and one play by a contemporary playwright each season. Seasons begin in September/October and lasts through May/June. The 2016‚Äì17 season will be its 22nd year. Past productions includes William Shakespeare's Othello, Antony and Cleopatra, The Comedy of Errors, Julius Caesar, The Merry Wives of Windsor, Romeo and Juliet, The Taming of the Shrew, The Tempest, and Twelfth Night; Tennessee Williams' Cat on a Hot Tin Roof; and George C. Wolfe's The Colored Museum.  Shake-It-Up Arts Education Program  AASC offers an arts education program called Shake-It-Up. The goal of the program is to provide students with skills of tackling complex reading and strengthening comprehension skills through theatre techniques and games in a positive and creative environment. These are done through workshops which educators sign-up for and professional educators/artists lead the sessions. In addition, AASC offers free student matinees for public schools where more than 2,200 students and their chaperones from all over the San Francisco Bay Area attend each season. AASC also offers educators a Teacher's Night Out event for preview performances where educators can attend at no cost.  The Cultural Corridor  Since 2015, AASC has hosted an annual free community outdoor performance series in the Fillmore District, Western Addition, and Hayes Valley neighborhoods of San Francisco known as The Cultural Corridor. The goal of the series is to unite performing arts groups in the neighborhood and highlight the cultural diversity of the area. The series began in September/October 2015 with three one-hour performances at the Fillmore Mini Park (Fillmore St between Turk St and Golden Gate Ave) leading up to the main three-hour performance at the PROXY open space (Hayes St and Octavia Blvd). In 2016, it added another location to the performance series at Buchanan Street Mall (Buchanan St and McAllister St) and three additional one-hour performances. Participants included AfroSolo, The San Francisco Bay Area Theatre Company, Nitty Dupree Studio of Dance, Cultural Odyssey: The Medea Project, SambaFunk!, SFJAZZ , San Francisco Ballet, San Francisco Conservatory of Music, Alumni and Friends of the San Francisco Youth Symphony, and Citizen Film.  Partnerships  AASC partners with various organizations in the San Francisco Bay Area throughout the years. Macy's was a sponsor of its Cinderella student matinees and offered special invitation to AASC supporters to various events such as Black History Month celebration events at their Union Square store. AASC partnered with the Golden Thread Productions to produce Isfahan Blues, a story inspired by Duke Ellington's tour of Iran in 1963. In 2015 for its production of Romeo & Juliet, it partnered with Oakland School for the Arts to cast teen actors in title and supporting roles as well as Litquake for their Teenquake programming. AASC has also collaborated with the San Francisco Opera for their Cinderella exploration workshop for families.

Moshe Ha-Elion has translated Homer's Odyssey into Ladino. He lives in Israel. He has two children, six grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren. Biography: before deportation Moshe Ha-Elion was born in Thessaloniki, Greece, on February 26, 1925. He came from a middle-class Sephardic Jewish family. Moshe's grandfather was a rabbi. Moshe's father, Eliau, worked as a bookkeeper in a shop. His mother, Rachel, was a housewife.Oral history interview with Moshe Haelion. USHMM. http://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/irn532733 His sister (a year and a half younger than him) was Ester (Nina). The family spoke Ladino at home. Outside the house, they spoke Greek. Moshe also learned Hebrew. Moshe studied at the Primary School \\"Talmud Tor√°\\" of the Jewish Community of Thessaloniki. The principal of the school was Moshe's uncle (Moshe's father's brother).Shalom - Moshe Haelion: http://www.rtve.es/alacarta/videos/shalom/shalom-moshe-haelion/3594098/ (May 1, 2016) Afterwards, he continued his studies at a public Greek gymnasium in Thessaloniki.Yad Vashem: http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/about/events/pope/francis/meeting.asp In 1936 there were some anti-Semitic attacks in Thessaloniki. Moshe was then 11 years old. Although his family was Zionist, they never thought of leaving Thessaloniki. When the Germans invaded Thessaloniki (April 9, 1941), everything changed: \\"When the Germans entered, we [felt] a big fear ... because we knew from the newspapers what happened in Germany: the Kristallnacht, the persecutions.\\" Moshe's father died on April 15, 1941, six days after the Germans invaded Thessaloniki.

Thessaloniki: https://www.ushmm.org/information/exhibitions/online-features/special- focus/holocaust-in-greece/thessaloniki On July 11, 1942, all Jewish men between the ages of 18 and 45 were ordered to concentrate in the Independence Square of Thessaloniki for \\"registration\\". In the square, the Jews suffered their first humiliations: the Germans forced them to do gymnastics in the hot weather and didn't allow them to drink water. Moshe and the rest of the Jewish community of Thessaloniki were informed by German Nazi officials that they would all be relocated to Poland.Moshe Ha Elion. ◊û◊ô◊¶◊®◊ô ◊©◊ê◊ï◊ú. Magav Mada Vetechnologia Ltd. Tel-Aviv, 1992. Then, Jews were ordered to wear the Yellow Star of David and forced into two ghettos, one in the east of Thessaloniki and one in the western, called Baron Hirsch, adjacent to the rail lines.USHMM. Salonika: https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005422 On March 15, 1943, the Germans began deporting Jews from Thessaloniki. Every three days, freight cars crammed with an average of 2,000 Thessaloniki Jews headed toward Auschwitz-Birkenau. By the summer of 1943, the Germans had deported 46,091 Jews. Most of the deportees were gassed on arrival in Auschwitz- Birkenau. Auschwitz Photo of the Nazi extermination camp at Auschwitz- Birkenau, taken by a United States Army Air Force plane, August 25, 1944 The first transport of Jews from Thessaloniki to Poland left on March 15, 1943. All transports left from the Baron Hirsch ghetto. On April 4, 1943 Moshe and his family (his mother and sister, both of Moshe's maternal grandparents, his uncle with his wife and their one year old child) were ordered to the Baron Hirsch ghetto believing that from there they will be transported and resettled in Poland. They packed their bags which included warm clothing they bought especially for settling in Poland, left their keys with their non-Jewish neighbors and moved to the Baron Hirsch ghetto. In the morning of April 7, 1943 Moshe and his family were transported in freight wagons packed with people. They travelled for six days and nights. He describes the deportation in his poem \\"La djovenika al lager\\".\\"La djovenika al lager\\". En los Kampos de la Muerte, p. 15. Maale Adumim, Israel, 2000. On the night of April 13 they arrived to Auschwitz. Moshe's mother and sister were gassed upon arrival. Moshe's maternal grandparents, his uncle's wife and his one-year-old son were also gassed upon arrival. Moshe's uncle was murdered in Auschwitz some months later. By August 1943, 46,091 Greek Jews were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Of those, 1,950 survived. Fewer than 5,000 of the 80,000 Jews living in Greece survived. The majority, after being rescued from the camps, emigrated to Israel.Costas Kantouris: Jews in Greece mark WWII Nazi deportation.

The prisoners were put inside freight wagons without water or food. After three days, they arrived at Mauthausen. Mauthausen, Melk and Ebensee Moshe was forced to work at Mauthausen concentration camp and then he was transferred to Melk, where he worked as a forced labourer in a munitions factory, inside the mountains, in tunnels. When the Allies were approaching the camps, the Germans took the prisoners through the Danube in small boats to the city of Linz and then, after four days by foot, to Ebensee. Mauthausen, Melk and Ebensee were located in Austria which was a part of Nazi Germany. The hunger was atrocious. Moshe had to eat carbon to survive. In his poem \\"Komo komian el pan\\",\\"Komo komian el pan\\". En los Kampos de la Muerte, p. 39. Maale Adumim, Israel, 2000. Moshe writes that during his years as a prisoner in the Nazi concentration camps his stomach was always crying. Liberation Survivors of the Ebensee concentration camp, after the liberation, 1945 On May 6, 1945, one week after Hitler's death, the American army liberated all the sub-camps of Mauthausen, including Ebensee, where Moshe Ha-Elion was a prisoner. Three American tanks entered Ebensee. Some prisoners were touching them to be sure that they were real. Some inmates were crying, some were shouting. Moshe Ha-Elion recalls that the Polish inmates were singing the Polish hymn, the Greek inmates were singing the Greek hymn and the French inmates were singing La Marseillaise. After, the Jewish inmates were singing Ha Tikvah. After the war After the liberation, Moshe Ha-Elion decided not to come back to Thessaloniki, and illegally emigrated to Palestine on board the Wedgewood boat in June 1946, after being in the south of Italy for one year. The boat was taken by the English army. Moshe was imprisoned for one month in a British camp in Atlit (located in British Mandatory Palestine). Work, studies and Remembering the Shoah Organizations after the war Moshe Ha-Elion fought in the Israeli Independence War. In 1950 he became an officer in the artillery division of the IDF. In 1970 he retired from his military career as a lieutenant colonel and finally in 1976, while serving in the reserved forces, he was named colonel. Moshe worked in the Israeli Ministry of Defense and was first an assistant and then head of an operational unit. He then worked for the administration until he retired. Moshe got his Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) and master's degree (M.A.) in Humanitas from the University of Tel-Aviv. Moshe Ha- Elion was the president of the \\"Asosiasi√≥n de los Reskapados de los Kampos de Eksterminasi√≥n, Orijinarios de Grecha en Israel\\" (Association of the Holocaust Survivors from Greece in Israel) from 2001 until 2015. Before that, and for 25 years, he was a member of the Association and vice president. After 2015 he received the title of Honorary President of the Association. Moshe Ha-Elion has been a member of the board of Yad Vashem for more than 10 years.Yad Vashem Magazine. Volume 80. June 2016: http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/pressroom/magazine/pdf/yv_magazine80.pdf He has also been a member of the board of the Li√≥n Recanati CASA and Honorary President of the \\"Chentro de Erensia de las komunidades de Saloniki i de Grecha\\" (Center of Heritage of the Saloniki and Greece Communities). Coming back to Auschwitz Flowers on the rails of Auschwitz-Birkenau Moshe Ha-Elion returned to Auschwitz several times in order to commemorate the victims of the Holocaust. In March 1987 he visited the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum together with his daughter, a group of other survivors and a radio crew of the Israeli radio station \\"Galei Zahal\\". Moshe says that he has been in Auschwitz 15 times, but, he remarks ironically, the first one was against his will. The message of Moshe Ha-Elion is: \\"The world must not forget (...) The Jewish people we are always going to remember, but the whole world has to know what happened\\". In 2015, Moshe said: \\"Two years ago I was in Auschwitz, with my daughter and my granddaughter, and my granddaughter was pregnant. We were there, four generations, at the place where they tried to kill me. That's my victory\\". Personal life Moshe's father died on April 15, 1941, just a few days after the Nazis invaded Thessaloniki (April 9, 1941). Moshe's mother and sister were gassed in Auschwitz upon arrival (April 13, 1943). On February 2, 1947, Moshe married Han√° Waldman in Palestine, whom he had met in Italy. They had a daughter called Rahel and a son called El√≠. Today Moshe has six grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. His wife Han√° Waldman passed away on September 1, 2010.

It won him international attention while still a student.  History  Rautavaara composed the work in 1953, after his studies at the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki from 1948 to 1952 with Aarre Merikanto. His style during that period was neoclassical, with close ties to tradition. The composition brought him international attention: it won him the Thor Johnson Brass Composition competition of 1954, and it prompted Jean Sibelius in 1955 to recommend him for a scholarship at the Juilliard School in New York City.  Music  Rautavaara structured the work in four movements: # Hymnus ‚Äì Festivamente # Credo et dubito ‚Äì Vivace ‚Äì Grave # Dies Irae ‚Äì Allegro # Lacrymosa ‚Äì Larghetto tranquillo Two of the four Latin titles correspond to movements of the Requiem mass, to parts of the sequence Dies irae (Day of Wrath), its verses \\"Dies irae\\" and \\"Lacrymosa dies illa\\" (Tearful will be that day). Rautavaara scored the work for 13 brass parts, timpani and percussion, and wrote the dedication \\"to the memory of my mother\\". The first movement opens with a trombone fanfare accompanied by trumpets. The meter changes often. The second movement, Credo et dubito (Belief and doubt), begins with muted trumpet and muted horn, which play with a staccato motif of sixteenth. At times horns and low brass interrupt by playing a grave chorale. The third movement is sharply articulated. The last movement is the only slow movement with gentle music associated with Requiem (Rest). The conductor Osmo V√§nsk√§ says: \\"It's a piece I've conducted many times. It has this kind of drama, but it's always speaking to the audience.\\". A reviewer of the Australian premiere on 8 April 2011 at Sydney's Opera House noted that the work combines \\"conciseness and economy of utterance with an opulent and romantic sense of expression\\".  Recording  A Requiem in Our Time is the title of a 2000 recording of Rautavaara's complete works for brass, performed by the Finnish Brass Symphony conducted by Hannu Lintu. A Requiem in Our Time is part of a 2003 recording of Rautavaara's works, performed by members of the Helsinki Philharmonic orchestra conducted by Jorma Panula. A reviewer noted that \\"virtuoso playing is required to achieve speed and pianissimo layering\\".

He served as prior of his convent of Randazzo until his death which occurred after an attack in which an arrow was shot into his head. Rabat√†'s beatification was confirmed on 10 December 1841 after Pope Gregory XVI confirmed that the late priest had a longstanding 'cultus' (or popular devotion) that was enduring. Life Luigi Rabat√† was born in Erice in 1443. Rabat√† became a member of the Carmelites at the convent of the Annunziata sometime in his adolescence and was later ordained as a priest before being appointed as the prior of the convent of Randazzo. He distinguished himself for giving alms to the poor and was known for his penances. In 1490 an attacker - said to be Antonio Catalucci  struck him in the head with an arrow and he forgave his attacker and refused to mention his name for fear the individual in question would receive a harsh punishment. The reason for the attack was that Rabat√† had denounced the extravagant dress of a local lord (said to be Catalucci's brother or father). He died after several months of great pain following this attack. His remains were housed under the main altar of the church at the convent in Trapani in 1640 while some of his relics were relocated to Erice in 1617. His remains were then transferred to an urn under the altar of the Assumption in the Basilica di Santa Maria on 13 August 1913. Beatification Processes for his beatification opened in Randazzo in 1533 and then other processes followed in 1573 while the title of Servant of God was bestowed upon him under Pope Clement VII in 1533 with the commencement of the cause. Rabat√† received formal beatification from Pope Gregory XVI on 10 December 1841 following official papal confirmation that the late Carmelite priest had a longstanding 'cultus' (or popular devotion) that proved to be enduring.

Mamie Francis Hafley (1885‚Äì1950), born Elba Mae Ghent, was a performer in Wild West shows and rodeos from about 1901 until 1940. She was famous for her daring horse-diving act that involved jumping off a 50-foot tower into a pool of water, for her sharpshooting ability from the back of a galloping horse, and for her high school horse- riding acts. Early life and family Elba Mae Ghent or \\"Mamie Francis\\" was the youngest child of Charles Edgar Ghent (1854‚Äì1909?) and Hannah Street Ghent (1853‚Äì1909?) who had married 26 September 1875 in Gratiot, Wisconsin. Her father had come to America as an infant with his parents, Henry and Henriet Ghent (commonly spelled \\"Gent\\"), on 16 September 1854 from the port of Liverpool, England. Mamie's mother, Hannah (or \\"Anna\\"), the daughter of Samuel Street of New Jersey and his wife, Elizabeth Armstrong, of New York, was a young child when her family moved to Wisconsin (before 1857). After they married, Charles Edgar and Anna Street Ghent moved to Nora, Illinois, where their children Charles H. Ghent (1876-?), Elizabeth B. Ghent Colt (1877‚Äì1902), and Elba Mae Ghent (1885‚Äì1950) were born. Wisconsin christening records show that the Ghents had to move back to Wisconsin shortly after Elba was born. Both of her siblings died as relatively young adults: Charles to an accidental shooting (witnessed by family) and Elizabeth (wife of Alfred Winston Colt) of unknown causes only three months after giving birth to a daughter, Bessie \\"Betty\\" Maretta Colt (1 September 1902). Elba's parents may have divorced or separated prior to the 1900 census. In Janesville, Wisconsin, 15-year-old Elba was living with her mother, Anna Street, who was working as a housekeeper for a farmer named Edmund Jaynes. Also in 1900, there was a \\"single\\" man (likely Elba's father) named \\"Charles E. Gent\\" living with his mother, H. Campbell in Burlington, Iowa. By 1905, \\"Charles E. Gent\\" was a \\"widower\\" living in Des Moines, Iowa. When Pawnee Bill's Historical Wild West Indian Museum and Encampment Show came to town in the early 1900s, Elba Mae Ghent joined the show, starting her performing career that spanned over four decades (1901‚Äì1940). As \\"Mamie Francis,\\" she became known for her courage, skill, and beauty, entertaining untold numbers of Americans during the heyday of the Wild West shows and rodeos of the early 20th century. Wild West shows What began in the mid-1830s with George Catlin's western art and lectures educating audiences about Indians and the American West, developed into \\"Wild West\\" traveling vaudeville performances featuring cowboys and Indians by the 1880s. Buffalo Bill's wild West and others became the most popular form of entertainment in America and remained so until movies gained prominence in the 1930s. The shows went beyond the cowboy sport of rodeo in an effort to preserve a romanticized view of the American West and to entertain those in the East (and later in Europe) who were fascinated with the disappearing frontier of the United States. Pawnee Bill's (1901‚Äì1905) One of the contemporaries of Buffalo Bill was Gordon Lillie, or Pawnee Bill. His show included such acts as horse races, bronco riding, trick riding, trick shooting, and historical reenactments. Mamie was fortunate to have joined Pawnee Bill's show when there were other performers who could share their expertise with her or inspire her to try to develop new skills. Lulu Bell Parr, for example, was an expert marksman and bronco rider with the show. Mamie, who had learned to trick shoot as a child, would have seen the sharpshooting performances of Lulu Bell, benefitting directly or indirectly from the star. Lulu Bell's bronc riding was not Mamie's forte, but she did trick riding and participated in the races and historical reenactments of the show. While a performer in Pawnee Bill's show, Mamie met a trick rider named Herbert Harry Skepper (1876‚Äì1945) who was a veteran of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and rode \\"Roman style\\" in the show. Harry and Mamie married about 1901 (no known record) and had one daughter, Elba Reine (\\"REEn\\") Skepper, 9 November 1902. While their marriage did not last, their daughter, Reine, did inherit much of the athletic ability of her parents, later becoming a trick rider and an accomplished star in the rodeos throughout the 1920 and 1930s (competing with and beating the men in certain rodeo events). California Frank Hafley's Wild West Attractions (1905‚Äì1940) After Harry Skepper had left Mamie and Reine on their own, Charles Francis Hafley and his wife, Lillian Smith (who had both performed in the Pan-American Exposition, with Cummins' Indian Congress, with Pawnee Bill and Buffalo Bill), asked Mamie Francis to join their venture called \\"California Frank's Wild West\\" in 1905. Lillian, a former competitor of Annie Oakley, and C.F. Hafley, a former sheriff, were renowned sharpshooters. They apparently thought this teenage mother, with her shooting and riding skills, would be a nice addition to their group who came from Pawnee Bill's and other Wild West shows. Lillian and Mamie started a comedy sharpshooting routine together, part of which involved Lillian shooting at targets on Mamie's hat or one sticking out of her mouth - requiring nerves of steel for both ladies. Another performer who likely acted as a mentor for Mamie was Ada Sommerville, a High School horse trainer. Bee Ho Gray (a trick roper who married Ada in 1912), was one of many (like Sam Cross, Julia Allen, Tommy Kirnan, and other vaudevillians) who joined California Frank's for a time or season and went on the perform in other shows (with the Miller Brothers' 101 Ranch Wild West Show, in particular). California Frank's company and the 101 Ranch Wild West Show participated in the Jamestown Exposition in 1907, marking the beginning of their relationship with the larger outfit both at the 101 headquarters in Oklahoma (the Millers were neighbors of Pawnee Bill) and at times performing with the 101 on the road. C.F. Hafley's show was not on as grand a scale as the 101 Ranch Wild West, but they had quality acts excelled by few to none at the time: Lillian Smith was better known as \\"Princess Wenona,\\" world champion horseback sharpshooter, Ada Sommerville on her magnificent horse, Columbus, danced to the \\"Merry Widow Waltz,\\" and Mamie Francis began her daring horse diving act in 1908 at Dreamland on Coney Island, New York City, New York. Mamie's performances on the high diving horse probably took more courage than any other act of that era. First, a diving horse named Serpentine would climb a ramp to reach a platform five stories above an audience who watched in quiet amazement as the horse carefully crouched her hind legs on a carpeted cleat before making a soaring leap into the air, plunging into a pool of water below. For the second dive, Mamie would mount the mother of Serpentine, a white Arabian horse named Lurlene (or \\"Babe\\"), and hold on tightly as the animal dove off the platform - the rider's long dark hair flying through the air before they hit the water. From 1908‚Äì1914, Mamie and Babe jumped 628 times with few incidents. The 1908 and 1909 newspapers recorded occasions where the horse and/or the rider were injured or almost killed: the first known incident was when the diving horse, Babe, was startled by a loud noise as she left the platform, fell sideways into the pool and was knocked unconscious. Had they not gotten her out of the water and resuscitated her, she would have drowned. Mamie was not injured. In the second occurrence, the horse fell on Mamie, breaking her arm. After a third accident, she continued diving with a broken foot 24 September 1908. In June 1909, she nearly met her death when she was knocked unconscious and pinned under her horse in the water at Bayonne Park in Jersey City. While Mamie was badly bruised, she responded to her near drowning by going on with the show. The accident illustrated her mental and physical toughness. She tried to go thank the men who saved her that day, but could not find them. In 1908, Frank and Lillian's marriage ended in divorce, but Lillian stayed on as a performer with the show through 1910. Charles F. Hafley and Miss Elba Skepper married 19 November 1909 in DeKalb County, Georgia. Frank adopted Mamie's daughter, Reine. California Frank's Western Attractions Show traveled all over the United States, entertaining audiences at amusement parks county and state fairs, and carnivals (Dreamland on Coney Island; the Hippodromes of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania;Cincinnati, Ohio; and Indianapolis, Indiana; the Majestic Theater in Kalamazoo, Michigan; the Alabama State Fair; the King's Highway Carnival in Omaha, Nebraska (and many more). According to the 1910 Federal Census for Knoxville, Tennessee, twenty people were traveling with the show. For the \\"Wild West Show,\\" occupations listed were: Showman, High Diver, Nurse, trainer, bugler, marksman, roper, rider, musician, talker, cook, labor(ers), and gunner. By the end of 1910, Princess Wenona, Ada Sommerville and Bee Ho Gray had left the show (they may have gone back to the Millers Brother's 101 Ranch and did not return to California Frank's). For the next two years, Mamie \\"wore three hats\\" as the sharpshooter, high school horse trainer, and the rider for the horse diving act. Her daughter, Reine, who performed in some of the acts as a child, served as the bugler for the grand entries. Sometimes real life proved as exciting as a performance (as in the following story that Mamie Francis shared with her only grandson). As California Frank's show traveled from town to town, they usually went by train. Some of the passenger trains had Pullman cars with sleeping births on them. Mamie Francis Hafley was resting alone in her upper birth when she was startled to hear on the other side of the curtain the porter of the train shouting, \\"No! No!! OH, please...No!\\" The would-be assailant growled, \\"I'm going to cut your black heart out!\\" Mamie grabbed her .38 pistol from under her pillow, yanked back the curtain, and pointed it betwixt the man's eyes. She cocked the firing pin, making a loud CLICK, and said with a commanding voice, \\"You're not going to cut anybody's heart out!!\\" and told the porter to, \\"Go get the train detective!\\" Seeing a very STEADY pistol aimed at him with Mamie's very steady focused eyes, \\"eye to eye,\\" the man folded his knife and put it back in his pocket, impressed that this woman might \\"sure enough\\" shoot him between the eyes. The years that she and Wenona had shot pistols in their vaudeville acts prepared Mamie to hold her pistol so the \\"end of the barrel\\" was pointed directly at the target. This time it saved a man's life! By 1914, Mamie was no longer diving horses off of towers and seemed to focus more on the high school horses, and sharpshooting on horseback. Her daughter, Reine, was beginning to perform as a trick rider in the shows. They were in a lucrative business for the times and, with the help of their nurse friend, Fannie Liesy, the Hafleys were able to buy a ranch near Ridgway, Colorado, in 1915. It was good to have a place to rest from all of the traveling they had done and continued to do for the show. Edmund Jaynes, the elderly farmer Mamie and her mother used to work for, came to Colorado to help with the place. In the teens and twenties, the acts in California Frank's shows were part western history, part rodeo, part comedy, and part animal circus - all thrilling to audiences who came for miles to see them. Mamie's high school horse, Napoleon, was a real crowd pleaser. Wild West shows and rodeos in general were still quite popular, but were experiencing some competition from silent (and later, \\"talkie\\") movies. The Hafleys kept in touch with other producers and performers (including silent western movie star, Tom Mix) and stayed connected with the Miller Brother's 101 Ranch off and on. In fact, C. F. Hafley was the arena director for the 101 Ranch when Mamie's daughter, Reine Skepper Hafley, fell in love with a tall cowboy named Dick Shelton who was working with the 101. Dick Shelton and Reine Hafley parted ways with the 101 Ranch when they eloped to get married. The young talented couple were back with California Frank and Mamie at the time J.C. Miller, their former boss, wrote \\"Miss Mamie,\\" \\"We had a nice visit with Rene and Dick and had quite a talk with them. I told them that I had no ill will toward them or hard feelings against them about staying with you and Frank. I know that I can get along without Dick better than you can without Rene, but any time that business slacks up, or you do not need them, I will always be glad to have them come over with me; or any or all of you, as far as that is concerned. I know of no friends that I hold in higher esteem than I do you and Frank and Rene, as well as the remainder of your bunch, and I trust the friendship will continue to exist.\\" (July 1925) Dick and Rene would go on to star in rodeos and fairs all over the country (they became Pro-rodeo Hall-of- Famers and more). They had Mamie's only grandson, Thomas Richard Shelton, in 1926. Mamie Francis and California Frank continued in their Wild West show without Reine, Mamie was still sharpshooting, and Frank was managing the cowboys and Indians. One would imagine that they were saddened to hear of Joseph Miller's accidental death in October 1927. In the 1930s, California Frank's Rodeo and Wild West Show added an all-girl rodeo band when they performed at Young's Million Dollar Pier in Atlantic City, New Jersey. They also performed in Dorney Park, Allentown, Pennsylvania; and the Fort Worth Stock Show and Rodeo, and many others. Gone were the bucking donkeys of earlier comedy routines. As the Great Depression drained their funds, the show \\"downsized\\" a bit (as did their personal property). In their routine, Frank and Mamie would ride alongside each other while Mamie shot targets Frank threw up in the air. They also trained a horse named \\"Ranger\\" to jump over their parked convertible Hudson with passengers in it. When the busy show season was over, the Hafleys would return to their ranch along the Uncompahgre River in Colorado. Later years and the Hall of Fame After Frank died in 1940, Mamie sold the ranch and bought a house in Fort Worth, Texas. Mamie Francis spent her last days at her daughter's ranch (where the Sheltons were breeders of Santa Gertrudis cattle) south of San Antonio in McMullen County. Mamie Francis Ghent Skepper Hafley died of cancer in 1950 near Tilden, Texas, and is buried in Handley's Shannon Rose Hill Memorial Park Cemetery in Fort Worth. In 1981, Mamie Francis Hafley was made an honoree at the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame in Fort Worth, Texas. Her Daughter, Reine Hafley Shelton, who had died in 1979, also became an honoree in 1983 for her accomplishments as a star in the Wild West shows and rodeos. The National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame is the only museum in the world dedicated to honoring and celebrating women, past and present, \\"whose lives exemplify the courage, resilience and independence that helped shape the American West.\\" As entertainers, champion competitors, and ranchers, Mamie Francis and her daughter, Reine Shelton, were both considered well-qualified for the honor.

In 1989 Queen Mary merged with Westfield College to form \\"Queen Mary & Westfield College\\". Although teaching began at the London Hospital Medical College in 1785, it did not become part of Queen Mary until 1995. In that same year the two medical schools merged to form the School of Medicine and Dentistry at Queen Mary & Westfield College. In 2000, the college adopted the working title of Queen Mary, University of London while retaining the legal name Queen Mary and Westfield College. In 2013 the legal name of the institution was changed to Queen Mary University of London. People's Palace Queen Mary College was founded in the mid Victorian era when growing awareness of conditions in London's East End led to drives to provide facilities for local inhabitants, popularised in the 1882 novel All Sorts of Conditions of Men ‚Äì An Impossible Story by Walter Besant, which told of how a rich and clever couple from Mayfair went to the East End to build a \\"Palace of Delight, with concert halls, reading rooms, picture galleries, art and designing schools.\\" Although not directly responsible for the conception of the People's Palace, the novel did much to popularise it. The trustees of the Beaumont Trust, administering funds left by Barber Beaumont, purchased the site of the former Bancroft's School from the Drapers' Company. On 20 May 1885 the Drapers' Court of Assistants resolved to grant ¬£20,000 \\"for the provision of the technical schools of the People's Palace.\\" The foundation stone was laid on 28 June 1886 and on 14 May 1887 Queen Victoria opened the palace's Queen's Hall as well as laying the foundation stone for the technical schools in the palace's east wing. The technical schools were opened on 5 October 1888, with the entire palace completed by 1892. When opening them, the Master of the Drapers' Company declared their aims to be \\"to improve the scientific and technical knowledge of apprentices and workmen engaged in industrial life\\". However others saw the technical schools as one day becoming a technical university for the East End. The conflicting demands of pleasure and education were identified by the Assistant Charity Commissioner as early as 1891 and for the next forty years this was to dog the People's Palace. In 1892 the Drapers' Company provided ¬£7,000 a year for ten years to guarantee the educational side income. East London College Expansion Part of the Charterhouse Square site The classes reached a peak of 8000 tickets in 1892‚Äì1893 but fell to less than half for the following year, due to competition from the London School Board, despite the Palace's classes being more advanced. With the level of teaching growing, in 1895 John Leigh Smeathman Hatton, Director of Evening Classes (1892‚Äì1896; later Director of Studies 1896‚Äì1908 and Principal 1908‚Äì1933) proposed introducing a course of study leading to the Bachelor of Science degree of the University of London. By the start of the 20th century the first degrees were awarded and Hatton, along with several other Professors, were recognised as Teachers of the University of London. In 1906 an application for Parliamentary funds \\"for the aid of Educational Institutions engaged in work of a University nature\\", led to the College being told it was \\"of the highest importance that there should be a School of the University in the faculties of Arts, Science and Engineering within easy reach of the very large population of the East End of London.\\" The educational part of the People's Palace was admitted on an initial three-year trial basis as a School of the University of London on 15 May 1907 as East London College. Aeronautics The ground-breaking wind tunnel built in the first ever Aeronautical department in the UK.Teaching of aeronautical engineering began in 1907 which led to the first UK aeronautical engineering department being established in 1909 which boasted a ground-breaking wind tunnel. Thus creating the oldest Aeronautical Programme in the World. A. P. Thurston, a former student at the College gaining a first class degree in Mechanical and Electrical Engineering in 1906, was encouraged and financially supported by P. Y. Alexander, a wealthy aeronautical enthusiast and acquaintance, and J. L. Hatton, the then Principal, to start regular courses of lectures in aeronautics. Thurston gradually brought in more and more skilled aeronautical engineers, and with the newly built laboratory, started giving lectures in aeronautics (\\"Flying machines\\", \\"Balloons, airships and kites\\", \\"The mechanical principles of flight\\") and started extensive research on fundamental matters such as the characteristics of wing sections and propellers, structural and material characteristics, and the forces on struts, leading to use in military aircraft for the First World War. 1910 to 1934 In 1910 the College's status in the University of London was extended for a further five years, with unlimited membership achieved in May 1915. During this period the organisation of the governors of the People's Palace was rearranged, creating the separate People's Palace Committee and East London College Committee, both under the Palace Governors, as a sign of the growing separation of the two concepts within a single complex. During the First World War the College admitted students from the London Hospital Medical College who were preparing for the preliminary medical examination, the first step in a long process that would eventually bring the two institutions together. After the war, the College grew, albeit constrained by the rest of the People's Palace to the west and a burial ground immediately to the east. In 1920 it obtained both the Palace's Rotunda (now the Octagon) and rooms under the winter gardens at the west of the palace, which became chemical laboratories. The College's status was also unique, being the only School of the University of London that was subject to both the Charity Commissioners and the Board of Education. In April 1929 the College Council decided it would take the steps towards applying to the Privy Council for a Royal Charter, but on the advice of the Drapers' Company first devised a scheme for development and expansion, which recommended amongst other things to reamalgamate the People's Palace and the College, with guaranteed provision of the Queen's Hall for recreational purposes, offering at least freedom of governance if not in space. Queen Mary College Granting of the royal charter In the early hours of 25 February 1931 a fire destroyed the Queen's Hall, though both the College and the winter gardens escaped. In the coming days discussions on reconstruction led to the proposal that the entire site be transferred to the College which would then apply for a Charter alone. The Drapers' Company obtained St Helen's Terrace, a row of six houses neighbouring the site, and in July 1931 it was agreed to give these over to the People's Palace for a new site adjacent to the old, which would now become entirely the domain of the College. Separation was now achieved. The Charter was now pursued, but the Academic Board asked for a name change, feeling that \\"east London\\" carried unfortunate associations that would hinder the College and its graduates. With the initial proposed name, \\"Queen's College\\", having already been taken by another institution and \\"Victoria College\\" felt to be unoriginal, \\"Queen Mary College\\" was settled on. The Charter of Incorporation was presented on 12 December 1934 by Queen Mary herself. Second World War and Post War period The Queens' Building During the Second World War the College was evacuated to Cambridge, where it shared with King's College. Meanwhile, the Mile End site was requisitioned for war work and was for a time used as the Municipal Offices of Stepney Borough Council. After the war the College returned to London, facing many of the same problems but with prospects for westward expansion. The East End had suffered considerable bomb damage (although the College itself had incurred little) and consequently several areas of land near to the College site now became vacant. The former church of St Benets' to the immediate east of the College was now defunct and was demolished in 1950, with the space used to build a new block for physics, but most of the acquisitions in the immediate post war years were to the west of the college. Even the new People's Palace was no longer able to meet its needs and it was acquired by the College along with several pieces of land that together formed a significant continuous stretch along the Mile End Road. New buildings for engineering, biology and chemistry were built on the new sites, whilst the arts took over the space vacated in the original building, now renamed the Queens' Building (to reflect the support and patronage of both Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother). Limited accommodation resulted in the acquisition of further land in South Woodford (now directly connected to Mile End tube station by means of the Central line's eastward extension), upon which tower blocks were established. Consequently, student numbers continued to expand. The College also obtained the Co-operative Wholesale Society's clothing factory on the Mile End Road which was converted into a building for the Faculty of Laws (and some other teaching), as well as the former headquarters of Spratt's Patent Ltd (operators of the \\"largest dog biscuit factory in the world\\" ‚Äì see Spratt's Complex) at 41‚Äì47 Bow Road, which was converted into a building for the Faculty of Economics founded by Maurice Peston, Baron Peston. Both faculties were physically separated from what was now a campus to the west. From the mid-1960s until the mid-1980s the College was in a period of uncertainty and flux. Much planning was dominated by the \\"BLQ scheme\\" which proposed to link Queen Mary College with the London Hospital Medical College and St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College with a joint facility in Mile End, but the land was not yet available. Over the period land that came onto the market was purchased with the intention to consolidate as soon as possible. The Queen Mary College Act 1973 was passed \\"to authorise the disposal of the Nuevo burial ground in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets and to authorise the use for other purposes thereof...\\" and gave the authority to disinter and reinter most of the graves to Dytchleys. A further link with both The London and St. Bartholomew's was made in 1974 when an anonymous donor provided for the establishment of a further hall of residence in Woodford, to be divided equally between Queen Mary College students and the two medical colleges. Nuclear reactor Queen Mary was home to a nuclear reactor from 1964 to 1982. From 1964 until 1982 QMC maintained a nuclear reactor, the first to be built for a UK university. A reactor was commissioned on the Mile End site beneath Mile End Road and operated from around 1964 to 1966 at around 1 kW. This reactor was the brainchild of the first Professor of Nuclear Engineering, Walter Murgatroyd, and was managed by John Shaw. The reactor was purchased from de Havilland. In 1966 it was decommissioned and a new 100 kW Argonaut class reactor was built at the new QMC Nucleonics Laboratory in Marshgate Lane, Stratford, London, upgraded in 1968, and decommissioned in 1982, with the site licence surrendered in November 1983. The Marshgate Lane site became part of the Olympic Park from 2006; in response to safety concerns about the former purpose of the site, a Greenpeace spokesman was quoted as saying \\"In our view there's nothing to worry about.\\" 1980 to 1989 At the start of the 1980s changing demographics and finances caused much concern through the university sector and led to a reorganisation of the University of London. At Queen Mary some subjects, such as Russian and Classics were discontinued, whilst the College became one of five in the University with a concentration of laboratory sciences, including the transfer of science departments from Westfield College, Chelsea College, Queen Elizabeth College and Bedford College. From the mid-1980s onwards the College began expanding across the newly acquired land to the east, taking the campus to the Regent's Canal. A part of the burial ground remains to this day but the rest of the area has been absorbed by the College's expansion. The long planned Pre Clinical Medicine building for the BLQ Scheme finally materialised in the late 1980s, further strengthening the ties between the three colleges. 1989 to 2010 In 1989 Queen Mary College (informally known as QMC) merged with Westfield College to form Queen Mary & Westfield College (often abbreviated to QMW). Over subsequent years, activities were concentrated on the Queen Mary site, with the Westfield site eventually sold. In 1990, the London Hospital was renamed the Royal London Hospital, after marking its 250th year, and a reorganisation of medical education within the University of London resulted in most of the freestanding medical schools being merged with existing large colleges to form multi-faculty institutions. In 1995 the London Hospital Medical College and St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College merged into Queen Mary & Westfield College to form the entity now named Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry. In 2000 the college changed its name for general public use to Queen Mary, University of London; in 2013, the college legally changed its name to Queen Mary University of London. The VISTA telescope is a 4-metre class wide-field telescope at the Paranal Observatory in Chile that was conceived and developed by Queen Mary University, costing approximately ¬£36m. The Westfield Student Village opened in 2004 on the Mile End Campus, bringing over 2,000 rooms to students and a huge array of facilities, restaurants, and cafes. The Blizard Building, home to the Medical School's Institute of Cell and Molecular Science opened at the Whitechapel campus in 2005. The award-winning building was designed by Will Alsop, and is named after William Blizard, an English surgeon and founder of the London Hospital Medical College in 1785. The year 2006 saw the refurbishment of The Octagon, the original library of the People's Palace dating back to 1888. In 2007 parts of the School of Law ‚Äì postgraduate facilities and the Centre for Commercial Law Studies ‚Äì moved to premises in Lincoln's Inn Fields in central London. The Women at Queen Mary Exhibition was staged in the Octagon, marking 125 years of Westfield College and 120 years of Queen Mary College. In September 2009, the world's first science education centre located within a working research laboratory opened at the Blizard Institute of Cell and Molecular Science, hoping to inspire children with school tours and interactive games and puzzles. 2010 to present Queen Mary became one of the few university-level institutions to implement a requirement of the A* grade at A-Level after its introduction in 2010 on some of their most popular courses, such as Engineering, Law, and Medicine. Following on from the 2010 UK student protests, Queen Mary set fees of ¬£9,000 per year for September 2012 entry, while also offering bursaries and scholarships. On 12 March 2012 it was announced that Queen Mary would be joining the Russell Group in August 2012. Later in March, Queen Mary and the University of Warwick announced the creation of a strategic partnership, including research collaboration, joint teaching of English, history and computer science undergraduates, and the creation of eight joint post-doctoral research fellowships. In January 2013, Queen Mary established the world's first professorial chair in animal replacement science. From 2014, Queen Mary began awarding its own degrees, rather than those of the University of London.

It stars Harshvardhan Kapoor in the lead role along with Priyanshu Painyuli, Ashish Verma and Nishikant Kamat in the supporting roles. The film revolves around a successful vigilante group that fades away with time but resurfaces when one of its members discovers the theft of water by a local politician and his henchmen. This is Nishikant Kamat's last film as actor before his death on 2020. Bhavesh Joshi Superhero released theatrically on 1 June 2018. Later on, it was also screened at Neuchatel Film Festival. Despite receiving moderately positive reviews, the film was a commercial failure grossing only 1.5 Cr on a 21 Cr budget. Plot Three young friends, Bhavesh (Priyanshu Painyuli), Siku (Harshvardhan Kapoor) and Rajat (Ashish Verma) come up with a YouTube channel Insaaf TV, creating an online show about Insaaf (justice) trying to expose to people some common wrongdoings and corruption which are rampant in the city. Initially, their show garners success, where they, wearing paper-bag masks, help to solve or confront some small scale corruptions in and around their neighborhood. Time soon flies; Siku and Rajat get jobs at corporate sector after passing out from college. Their interest for Insaaf TV gradually fades out except for Bhavesh, who gets obsessed about eradicating corruption from society and continues with his vigilante acts despite a fall in their channel viewership. He receives an email from an elderly citizen about water problems existing in and around his locality and starts investigating the case. He discovers that the water pipes across the city meant for delivering water to the households have been fitted with extra pipes to siphon out water to water tankers which are then delivered to the various neighborhoods making people buy the same water which they were supposed to receive for free from the municipality. Bhavesh leaks this news to his channel and this results in the water mafia Patil (Pratap Phad), responsible for this act, starting to look into the true identity of the masked man behind Insaaf TV. In the meantime, despite providing all the proper documents and doing multiple follow ups with the local police station, Siku's police clearance for his VISA processing to move to the US doesn't get approved until he pays bribe to the police officials to get the things done. Bhavesh becomes furious knowing this and they get initially engaged in a verbal tiff. An angered Bhavesh tells that all the govt. officials and politicians are corrupt and should be eradicated to cleanse the society with Siku recording his dialogues on his phone. Bhavesh punches Siku, breaking his nose. An enraged Siku uploads the video on Insaaf TV channel. Soon, Bhavesh is termed by the media as anti-national and unpatriotic. He is thrashed by the mob and then gets arrested thereby revealing his identity to Patil who warns him, but desperate to prove his innocence and uncover the truth to people, he sets out to gather evidence despite being injured. He gets caught in the process and Patil mauls him to death. The police hand over his body to Siku for last rites claiming it to be an accident and further warn him not to get involved into this. Blaming himself for Bhavesh's death, Siku tricks the police into believing that he has left for the US and takes refuge in an abandoned hotel which served as a safe house for their gang. He sets out covering his face in a mask and accidentally blows up Patil's pump house where he used to fill the siphoned water to the water trailers. It is then revealed that Patil has backing from the local political leader Rana (Nishikanth Kamath). Siku gets himself a new vigilante costume, buys a motorcycle, customizes it by fitting nitro cylinders and interrogates govt. officer Subhash Mhatre (Hrishikesh Joshi) who reveals that Bhavesh was killed by Patil as he was about to uncover his illegal water supply activities. A fight breaks out between him and Mhatre's men during the interrogation and a nearly overpowered Siku is saved by Bhavesh's martial arts trainer. Siku posts his interrogation video in Insaaf TV and introduces himself as Bhavesh Joshi, still alive. He also starts learning martial arts and other combat techniques from the martial arts trainer. As the video goes viral, Patil gets arrested by police. However, Mhatre gets killed soon with police claiming it to be a suicide and that Mhatre has taken his own life out of guilt as he was forced to wrongly confess about Patil by Bhavesh. Patil is released due to lack of evidence. Siku disguises himself and visits the dance bar where Patil comes every night. He plants a bug in Patil's VIP room and gets to know that he is planning to blow up the water pipes across the city to create an acute shortage of drinking water. However, police inspector Sunil Jadhav (Chinmay Mandlekar) discovers him in the bar and after a long vehicular chase, a disguised Siku escapes, causing an enraged Patil to shoot a constable and forcing police to put the blame on Bhavesh. Suspicious about who is behind Insaaf TV after Bhavesh's demise, Rajat starts to keep an eye on Siku's girlfriend, Sneha (Shreiyah Sabharwal) and discovers that he has not left India and has assumed the identity of Bhavesh Joshi. Siku arrives at the place targeted by Patil's men and fights them, later getting caught and unmasked in the process. They succeed in their mission to blow up the water pipes with an injured Siku watching in vain. Patil and Rana tell inspector Sunil to kill Siku and dump his body in water thus putting the blame on Bhavesh Joshi for this terrorist act against Mumbai. Sunil hesitantly shoots Siku. Getting to know of the location from his secret hideout, Rajat follows Siku and captures everything on camera. Once Siku is thrown into water, he rescues him and takes him to a hospital. However, Siku suggests him to let people think that he is dead and so Rajat admits him to the hospital under a fake alias of Mohan. As Siku recovers, Mumbai suffers from acute drinking water crisis. Rana meets the Chief Minister and tells him that he can arrange for water free of cost but instead should get the contracts of all future water related projects. Everyone gets drinking water for free and both the CM and Rana become heroes in common people's eyes. Rajat delivers the video of that night to Sunil Jadhav via a kid and forces him to open an investigation about the blast. As the true news spreads across the city Bhavesh Joshi starts gaining support and protests start everywhere. At night, Siku infiltrates Rana's house and takes out all his security guards. Rana comes down from his bedroom and sees all his bodyguards are knocked out and encounters \\"Insaaf-Man\\" (Based on the Graphic novel written by Rajat) at the balcony. In a mid-credits scene, Insaaf- Man(Siku) is seen telling a driver to reverse his car from a no-entry road.

Frances Marion's screenplay is based on the 1922 novel The Dust of Desire by Margaret Peterson. Plot The plot of The Song of Love focuses on the relationships among North African Arab citizens, Tuaregs, and French colonial citizens who live in a small outpost with homes, shops and a bar/social spot. Norma Talmadge is a dancing girl, whose uncle is viewed as a leader in the Arab community and owner of the social spot. Other key roles are an Arab prince, seeking support from the Tuaregs to regain control of the outpost from the French colonists; a French secret service agent (who becomes the love interest); the French colonial leaders: a French spouse and an American. Through intrigue and conversations, the storyline evolves during the 81 minutes of this movie, resulting in a nighttime battle scene and the main characters professing love for each other.

Set on a steeply sloped parcel are its main house, an 1816 brick building, a barn, and a 1930s bungaloid guest house. The hilly terrain is heavily landscaped, forming an important visual component of the estate, and serving to afford it privacy from the nearby public roads. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, primarily for the well- preserved Federal period architecture of the main house. Description and history The Owen Moon Farm stands on the west side of Morgan Hill Road, about south of Vermont Route 106 in southern Woodstock. It is set on a wooded rise, with a loop drive that accesses the building complex from the east and south. The main house stands at the top of the rise, screened from the road by a stand of tall trees. It is a 2-1/2 story brick building, with a post-and- beam wooden frame, gabled roof, and brick veneer exterior. The main facade faces east, and has a center entrance with flanking sidelight windows that have oval tracery, and narrow pilasters, with a rectangular transom and entablature above. A square-headed Palladian window is set directly above the entrance. A Colonial Revival porch projects from the north gable end, and a 1-1/2 story ell extending to the building's rear. A 1-1/2 story Bungalow-style guest house stands just west of the house, and a c. 1890 barn, rehabilitated in the late 1930s, stands to the south. with The house was built in 1816 by John Lake, a highly regarded local carpenter. For much of the 19th century it belonged to the Kendall family, and was purchased in 1937 by Owen Moon, a retired businessman. Moon oversaw the transformation of the property into a country estate, enlarging the house, building the guest house, and rehabilitating the barn. Moon also had the hilly parcel terraced and landscaped with formal and informal gardens.

During the hostage crisis, two hostages were injured, one seriously. Miranda was the only fatality during the crisis itself. However, a few weeks after the event, he was found to have murdered his former girlfriend prior to the crisis. Event Start of the crisis The incident began just before 7:00 a.m. on February 6, 1996, when 28-year-old John Nahale Miranda burst into the Seal Masters of Hawaii building. The company was a waterproofing business that was based in Sand Island, Honolulu. Miranda had previously worked at the building as an employee but had been fired eight months prior to the crisis. Miranda was enraged over having no money or job; he had also accused company officials of racism and firing him solely because he was Hawaiian/Puerto Rican. Miranda had armed himself with a sawed-off shotgun and a knife. As he made entry, Miranda demanded twenty-thousand dollars in cash from the company. The company owner, Harry Lee, prepared to accept the deal, but Lee's wife insisted on calling the police instead. As the call was made, Miranda took five employees who were working in the building hostage. One of them was his former supervisor and vice president of the company, 59-year-old Guy George. George had been the one to personally fire Miranda at the time of his dismissal. Miranda then opened fire with his sawed-off shotgun and shot George once in the leg. George suffered a serious gunshot wound to his right leg, and nearly half of it was blown off. Law enforcement and media response Miranda called local radio station I-94 and explained to them what he was doing. The presenters of the radio tried to talk him down and implored him to surrender peacefully, but Miranda refused as he had already been to jail previously and had no intention of returning. Law enforcement responded quickly after Miranda's initial break in and cordoned off the area. SWAT teams were called in and sharpshooters got into position around the building. Local news television crews also arrived on scene moments later and began broadcasting the event live. Negotiation During the early stages of the negotiations, Miranda dragged George to an open window and showed police he had already shot a hostage. Miranda threatened authorities and told them he had no intention of surrendering peacefully. At some point during the crisis, Miranda turned his attention elsewhere and George climbed out of the same open window and fell ten feet to the ground below. He then crawled across the ground and dragged himself away to safety. This enraged Miranda who then grabbed hold of another hostage, 30-year-old Tom McNeil. Miranda taped his sawed-off shotgun with duct tape to the back of McNeil's head and taped his own hand to the trigger of the gun. Miranda then exited the building with his four remaining hostages and ordered them to walk down the steps to the street below. He let three of them go and returned to the top of the steps with McNeil, who was now his only hostage. Miranda remained outside with McNeil for hours and the standoff continued at the top of the steps. Police pleaded Miranda to surrender peacefully, but he refused to cooperate. After hours passed, Miranda finally ordered McNeil to head down with him to the street. Suspect shot At around 2:30 p.m., Miranda stood with McNeil in the street surrounded by police officers from all sides. He then ordered McNeil to count down from sixty- seconds to zero. Once McNeil reached zero Miranda declared he would execute him. McNeil refused to comply, so Miranda began counting down for him instead. McNeil believed that once Miranda got to ten seconds it would be the end for him. As soon as Miranda reached thirteen, McNeil spun around and tried to break free. Miranda fired a shot, but missed, and police were then forced into action. Miranda was shot in the chest by police and McNeil broke free. Miranda was taken to The Queen's Medical Center hospital, but died of his gunshot wounds and was pronounced dead at 2:55 p.m. George had also been taken to the same hospital earlier in the day, recovering from the gunshot wound to his right leg. Aftermath Casualties Three of the hostages escaped unharmed, and McNeil himself only suffered a few minor injuries and scrapes during his struggle with Miranda. McNeil had been able to walk to a nearby ambulance and was treated at St. Francis Medical Center for cuts and bruises, but no gunshot wounds. George suffered the most serious injuries with a gunshot wound to the leg, but he also survived after being taken to Queen's Hospital. Miranda initially survived after being shot by police, but died later in the day from his wound. Miranda was the only fatality during the entire crisis. Sherry Lynn Holmes 32-year-old Sherry Lynn Holmes was thought to be Miranda's current girlfriend at the time of the crisis. Holmes had reportedly been missing since January 31, 1996. According to police, during the standoff, Miranda had hinted that he had killed Holmes. Acting on an informant's tip, police searched Kawai Nui Marsh for the body of Holmes. Honolulu police and a team of dogs scoured the area several times before finding a cardboard box, buried only a few yards off a Quarry Road. The box was pulled from a shallow grave on March 29, 1996. Inside the box was a highly decomposed body, which was too decomposed to be positively identified at the time. Police were nearly certain that it was the body of Holmes. As no dental records existed for Holmes, investigators enlisted the aid of the Army's identification lab in Honolulu, using DNA and photo imaging technology to be certain. They confirmed the body was that of Holmes, and that she had been murdered by Miranda prior to the hostage crisis. In popular culture In a special edition of World's Wildest Police Videos, known as World's Scariest Police Shootouts, footage of the event was shown in the finale of an episode; McNeil also described his experience on the day of the crisis in an interview. In April 2017, McNeil did an interview with Edmonton Journal, describing how his life had been after the crisis. He revealed that he got married only six days after it. McNeil also did an interview in February 2018 with KHON-TV, in which he revealed that he'd moved to Canada in 2010, where he still resides. McNeil talked about the crisis and said the ordeal changed his view on life, making him appreciate everything that he has.

Ancestry His ancestry was Maghnus Ruadh son of Tom√°s M√°g Samhradh√°in the Second (d. 1340) son of Brian ‚ÄòBreaghach‚Äô M√°g Samhradh√°in (d.1294) mac Donnchadh ‚ÄòCime‚Äô M√°g Samhradh√°in (d.1269) mac Giolla na Naomh M√°g Samhradh√°in (the Second) (d.1255) mac Giolla √çosa M√°g Samhradh√°in (d.1231) mac Giolla na Naomh M√°g Samhradh√°in, the First (fl.1170) mac Muireadhach M√°g Samhradh√°n (fl.1130) mac Samhradh√°n (fl.1100), who were all previous chiefs of the clan.M.V. Duignan (1934), \\"The Ui Bri√∫in Br√©ifni genealogies\\", pp. 90‚Äì137, in JRSAI Vol. LXIV His mother was Nualaidh, the daughter of the Maguire chief and Maguire‚Äôs wife √âadaoin √ì‚ÄôCeallaigh. His brothers were Tighearn√°n, Brian (d. 1337), Aedh (d.1351), S√©an, Conchobhar, Niall M√°g Samhradh√°in who preceded him as chief and died in 1359, Fearghal M√°g Samhradh√°in who also preceded him as chief and died in 1393, Giolla na Naomh, Tadhg Buidhe (d.1367), Maghnus Buidhe (d.1357) and Matha (d.1356). Chieftainship On the death of the previous chief in April 1393, his brother Fearghal M√°g Samhradh√°in, Maghnus succeeded and reigned as chief until his death in 1408. In 1398 a series of recurring conflicts with the Maguire clan of Fermanagh began. The Annals of the Four Masters for 1398 state- Art Cuile, the son of Philip Maguire, was slain by the people of Teallach Eachdhach (Tullyhaw). In 1401 the McGoverns attacked the O'Reilly stronghold of Cavan Town. The Annals of Loch C√© for 1401 state- The attack of the Cabhan was made by the sons of O'Ruairc. viz., Tighernan Og, and Aedh Buidhe, and Tadhg, and by the sons of Mac Samhradhain, on Mael-mordha O'Raighilligh; and Muinter-Maelmordha had an encampment after them; and it is not easy to count the people and valuables that were destroyed there; and twenty loads of clothing were burned there, along with the Biatach's son, who came to assist Muinter-Raighilligh; and two score horses were taken from them besides. The Annals of Connacht for 1401 state- The attack on Cavan was delivered by the sons of O Ruairc, that is Tigernan Oc and Aed Buide and Tadc, and the sons of Mag Samradain, against Maelmorda O Raigillig, while the Muinter Mailmorda were encamped in their rear. It is hard to estimate the destruction wrought there, of people and goods. Twenty suits of armour were burned there, as well as Mac in Biataigh, who came to the help of the Muinter Raigillig. Two score horses were taken from them as well. In 1405 his first cousin Cathal, son of Donnchadh, son of Brian ‚ÄòBreaghach‚Äô M√°g Samhradh√°in died. The Annals of Loch C√© for 1405 state- Cathal, son of Donn Mac Samhradhain, mortuus est in hoc anno. The Annals of Connacht for 1405 state- Cathal son of Dond Mag Samradain died this year. There was trouble in 1408 when some of the McGoverns invaded Tyrconnell. The Annals of the Four Masters for 1408 state- Owen O'Rourke and the sons of Donn Magauran went into Tirconnell, to make war against the Breifnians. The Annals of Loch C√© for 1408 state- Eoghan O'Ruairc, and the sons of Donn Mac Samhradhain, went into Tir-Conaill, to war against the Breifnians. The Annals of Connacht for 1408 state- Eogan O Ruairc and the sons of Donn Mag Samradain went into Tir Conaill to make war upon the men of Brefne. Rent Roll An interesting list of the rents and cess due to Maghnus, as Chief of the McGoverns, appears in the last entry in the Book of Magauran. It is a partial list of the rents of just four townlands in Tullyhaw and reads as follows: Boley, Templeport 34 kegs of butter for the half- quarterland of Buaile Fheadha (lethceathreamain Buaili Adh, meaning 'The Half- Quarterland of the Dairy in the Forest') i.e. 3 kegs of butter and 12 kegs of meal every quarter year i.e. the winter quarter and the autumn quarter and that of spring, and this is the steward's portion:- A gallon of butter and 2 kegs of meal per quarter, and this is McGovern's demand from An Bhuaile (mBuaili):- A keg of butter and 3 bands, and a gallon and 3/8 of a hundredweight and a band, and this is his milk-portion in wintertime:- A keg of butter on the first Saturday, and 3/8 the following Saturday, and a gallon on each of the other Saturdays, and 3/8 the following Saturday and a band soon after that, and the person who comes with it is told to bring his portion of milk with him and let him have the strainer with him, with which he will choose the curds until the pool of milk is separated also.Leabhar M√©ig Shamradh√°in, the MacGovern Poembook by Nollaig √ì Mura√≠le, in \\"Culture and society in early modern Breifne/Cavan\\", Dublin 2009. Derrycassan Sruhagh This is the portion of Sruagh- 18 kegs of butter and 50 measures of milk and a band of butter every Sunday from Mayday to Michaelmas and 3 portions of raw meat each year and a gallon of butter in summertime and 8 cakes each year.Leabhar M√©ig Shamradh√°in, the MacGovern Poembook by Nollaig √ì Mura√≠le, in \\"Culture and society in early modern Breifne/Cavan\\", Dublin 2009. CarrowlattaMcManus (meaning The Quarter Ballybethagh of the Monument of the Sons of Maghnus) This is the portion of Ceathraimhe Leachta Meic Mhaghnusa- 18 kegs of butter and a pig and two tapestries. And this is his measure at Christmas- 4 kegs of butter and eight kegs of meal. From this list we see that in 1400 the main type of farming carried on in Tullyhaw was milk and beef cattle together with sheep & pigs and raising of crops such as oats. It is interesting that embroidered tapestries were acceptable as rent payments. Death Maghnus was killed by a member of the Gilroy clan from Fermanagh in 1408 The Annals of the Four Masters for 1408 state- Manus Magauran was killed by the blow of a pole, thrown at him by Baethan Mac Gilroy. The Annals of Loch C√© for 1408 state- Maghnus Mac Samhradhain was killed by the Baethan Mac Gilla-ruaidh, with a cast of a pole.

Lewis R. Morris House is a historic house and farm property at 456 Old Connecticut River Road in Springfield, Vermont. Its main house, built in 1795, is well-preserved local example of Federal architecture with later Greek Revival features. The property also includes well-preserved 19th-century agricultural buildings, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Description and history The Morris House stands overlooking the Connecticut River in eastern Springfield, its informally landscaped lot separated from the river bank by Old Connecticut River Road, historically the main route along the river's west bank (since replaced by United States Route 5, which passes west of the farm property). The main house is a two-story wood frame structure, with a hip roof and clapboarded exterior. The east-facing front facade is five bays across, with a center entrance flanked by pilasters and topped by a half-round transom window and gabled pediment. The building corners have narrow pilasters, rising to a dentillated cornice. The interior follows a typical Georgian central hall plan, with much original Federal period woodwork augmented by Greek Revival touches. The farm complex also includes 19th-century carriage and stock barns, and a large corn crib. with The house was built in 1795 for Lewis R. Morris, one of Springfield's early settlers and a veteran of the American Revolutionary War. The Morrises had extensive landholdings, some of which were confiscated due to the support of Morris's father Richard for the claims of New York for the territory that is now Vermont. Morris descendants owned the property until the late 19th century, when Leonidas Barry acquired it; he is responsible for a number of alterations to the house and the construction of several of the surviving outbuildings. Some of his alterations, notably the lengthening of its window bays, have been reverse by subsequent owners, in order to restore the building closer to its original appearance.

In 1938, he created the South Indian Film Artistes Association and served as Secretary under P.N. Velu Nair, the Association's President. Mani's contributions were described by Tamil actor and Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu M.G. Ramachandran in his autobiography Nan Yaean Piranthaen.  Early Life  M.V. Mani's birth name was Vancheeswaran Subramanian. He was born on 15 July 1904, in Vaikom, a temple city situated in the Kottayam District in the Indian state of Kerala, the oldest son of Vancheeswaran and Kaveri Ammal. Inclined towards acting at an early age, Mani decided to leave home at the age of eleven to pursue his passion with just four annas (equivalent to one Indian rupee 25 paise) in hand. Mani first worked as a cook in Malayatur, after which he traveled to Thanjavur to learn Carnatic music. By the age of sixteen, Mani had acquired musical proficiency and, with very little money, he traveled all the way to Madras (now known as Chennai) to further his engagement with the performing arts.  Entry into Chennai and involvement in the theatre and film industry  Mani joined the renowned drama troupe \\"Ottraivaadai Theatre\\", a group run by Jagannatha Iyer, to launch his career as an actor. During his time with the troupe, Mani performed in plays entitled Lava Kusa, Pathi Pakti, Rajambal, and Krishna Leela. Mani's role as a judge in the drama Rajambal is often lauded as his best performance with the troupe, an accomplishment that later brought him a role of an advocate in the film version of the play. N.S. Krishnan recommended Mani for the role of the detective Srinivasan in the film Sathi Leelavathi, the debut film of the legendary actor M.G. Ramachandran, who later became the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. Ramachandran mentioned Mani in his autobiography Naan Yaen Piraenthaen. During those years Mani was associated with many well-known movie personalities such as S.S. Vasan, A. Nageswara Rao, Anjali Devi, M.G. Chakrapani, R.S. Manohar, N.C. Vasanthakokilam, K.B. Sundarambal, G.N. Balasubramanian, T.N. Rajaratnam Pillai, Comedian Sarangapani, T.S. Balaiah, M.K. Radha and Ellis Duncan of Hollywood. In Tamil movies, Mani played an important role in Sathi Anusaya with the Great Carnatic musician-actor G.N. Balasubramaniam (GNB), Sri Kandha Leela with the popular and versatile actress K.B. Sundarambal (Avvaiyaar Pugazh) followed by Kalamegam, with the legendary Nadhaswara Vidvan \\"Rajarathnam Pillai\\". In Venu Ganam, he co-starred with the famous Carnatic Music Singer N.C. Vasantha Kokilam, followed by an appearance in Maccha Reka with the celebrated Artist T.R. Mahalingam. His acting prowess caused the great S.S. Vasan to offer Mani the impressive role of Patti [Minister] in Vasan's film Dasi Aparanji, which was a hit film of those days. Mani's role as Minister earned him the appellation Manthri V. Mani, in short, M.V. Mani. In \\"Madana Mala\\" Mani showcased his talent in sword fighting.  Entry into freedom fighting and social work  Mani was a true Gandhian and took part in the freedom struggle. He shared the platform in public meetings with Rajaji, Namakkal Rajamanikkam Pillai, Kalki Krishnamurthi and others. His own trials and tribulations in the film industry urged him to create an association with the motive of enhancing the status of people associated with the film industry in general and actors in particular. Mani finally succeeded in his efforts, forming the Film Actors Association with Mr. P.S. Velu Nair presiding as President and Mani himself as the first secretary. The seed that Mani had so industriously sown grew into a monumental tree: with Sthala Vriksha becoming a strong film actor's welfare advocacy organisation, now known as the Nadigar Sangam.  M.V.

The company was founded in 1809 by Robert Harrild at Norwich Street, London, and closed down in 1949. The company helped to establish the use in London of composition rollers instead of ink balls to ink the printing plates. History Robert Harrild established the company Harrild & Sons Limited in 1809 in Farringdon, London. The company used to manufacture printing presses for letterpress printing. The company started manufacturing presses with ink balls (since the printing presses then used ink balls rather than composition rollers to ink the plates). In 1813, Harrild joined the discussion within the London printing community and talked about use of \\"composition rollers\\" instead of \\"ink balls\\" to ink the printing plates. The majority of hand printers preferred use of ink balls over composition rollers but after successful demonstration of Harrilds composition roller, every printer in London started using the composition roller. To manufacture the rollers, Harrild established another company at 25 Farringdon Street in London. Harrild & Sons eventually started manufacturing all kinds of printing equipment. After his death in 1853, the company was operated by Robert Harrild's sons until it ceased operations in 1949. Products Harrild & Sons Limited manufactured and marketed composition roller printing presses, paragon platen printing presses (Columbian, Albion and Jobbing presses), types, paper ruling machines, trimming machines, newspaper folding machines and other items connected with printing machinery.
