Wilhelm Dachauer (5 April 1881, in Ried im Innkreis, Austria – 26 February 1951, in Vienna) was an Austrian painter. He studied at the Akademie der bildenden Künste in Vienna from 1899 to 1907 and was professor from 1928 to 1944 at the same academy. Life Wilhelm Dachauer was born on 5 April 1881 into a family of clockmakers. He was intended to continue his fathers business but after some struggle he was allowed to move to Vienna, where he had a time full of privations. He started an apprenticeship as decoration painter and in the nighttime he prepared for the Academy of Applied Arts. In 1899 the seventeen-year-old Wilhelm began his studies under the supervision of Professor Griepenkerl. In 1913 he had his first arguably successful exhibition at the Secession. He was appointed to an honored professorship of the Akademie der bildenden Künste (Academy of Fine Arts) in Vienna in 1928, a position that he occupied until 1944. Temporarily he was even rector of the institution. Among his students were Hildegard Joos, Maria Lassnig, Adalbert Pilch, and Peppino Wieternik (1919–1979). He was one of the founders and leaders of the Federation of German Painters, Austrian branch (Bund Deutscher Maler Österreichs), which from 1937 sought to bring together painters with National Socialist sympathies. Wilhelm Dachauer joined the Nazi party in July 1938. A Committee of Inquiry after the end of World War 2 found him not guilty of serving the Nazis through his work, however he was never reinstated to his post at the Academy of Fine Arts. Wilhelm Dachauer died in Vienna on 26 February 1951. Opus Jugendstil stamp design, \\"Art,\\" Minkus New World-Wide Postage Stamp Catalog, 1974-75, Vol. II, \\"Austria,\\" no. 574. 1922 Wilhelm Dachauer was initially influenced by the art of the Secession and later developed a form of realism that was strongly dedicated to rural and regional arts. This style fitted well to the \\"official\\" taste of the Ständestaat and the National Socialist regime, so his work became somewhat disreputable after 1945. The award-winning stamp of the Nibelungen-set,1926, Austria Nr.489. He was rather unconsciously known to the public by the design of some stamp series than for his other paintings. Among his stamp designs are the well-known set of the Nibelungen motifs and the inventor set; other motifs are: Stille Nacht and Johann Strauß. In 1926 he was awarded the Thomson medal for the most beautiful stamp in the world for the second stamp of the before mentioned Nibelungen set. The design of this stamp has the title \\"Gunters Drachenschiff auf dem Weg nach Island\\" (Gunter's Dragon Boat on the Way to Iceland). This stamp has a nominal value of 8+2 g (Groschen). After the annexation of Austria to the German Reich and the occupation of Poland he designed several other stamps of the so-called Generalgouvernement and a few of the German Reich. He also made the designs for several Austrian stamps after World War II, among them the so-called Homecomer series. Ten glass windows and one altarpiece of the Franziskaner hospital chapel in Ried 1928 are designs of Dachauer. More conserved works are the portraits of Julius Wagner-Jauregg and Viktor Kaplan. Nowadays a street - the Wilhelm-Dachauer Straße in Essling, the 22nd borough of Vienna - is named after this more or less famous painter.

The term also encompasses the work of the so-called Twintigers (\\"writers of the twenties\\"). The giants of the war era, such as Totius, Jan F. E. Celliers, or C. Louis Leipoldt, having come more or less to terms with the past, began at this time to address topics such as religion or nature. Meanwhile, Eugene Marais, while a contemporary of the war poets, stands out by his choice of material. Younger poets who emerged during this era are Toon van der Heever, A. G. Visser, H. A. Fagan, A. D. Keet, J. R. L. van Bruggen, and Theo Wassenaar. As the Anglo-Boer War receded into the past, however, the conflict remained a topic, but became rather a vehicle for the depiction of romanticized history, rather than a personal crucible that required the expression of suffering. As a result, the Twintigers remained overshadowed by their predecessors. In addition, they fade in importance to the growing professionalism of the succeeding generation, the Dertigers. Nonetheless, the Twintigers can be credited with the development of the love poem and the cultivation of the nature poem in Afrikaans.1 References 1Lindenberg, E., et al. \\"Inleiding tot die Afrikaanse Letterkunde\\".

Political career McGee was a registered Republican for her entire political career, and was frequently cross-endorsed by the Conservative Party of New York. Prior to her foray into politics, McGee worked as a secretary and administrative assistant at Franklinville Central School and the Olean campus of Jamestown Community College. McGee's political career began in 1978 as she was elected to the Cattaraugus County Legislature, where she served for 10 years, and served as that county's first female majority leader. McGee was elected in 1987 in a special election to fill the 149th Assembly District seat caused by the resignation of longtime incumbent Daniel B. Walsh of Olean. Walsh had resigned in early 1987 to accept a policy position with the Business Council of New York State. In the assembly, McGee served on many committees. In 1998, she was tapped to replace Jess Present, who had recently died, in the New York State Senate. Moving to the Republican-dominated Senate led to McGee earning the title of chairperson on the Agriculture Committee, the Commission on Rural Resources and the Committee on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse, as well as serving prominently on numerous other committees. She was often seen as a conservative maverick; she was one of only seven Senate votes who opposed an increase in the state's minimum wage, on the principle that it would put her Southern Tier district at a competitive disadvantage with neighboring counties in Pennsylvania. McGee was instrumental in helping her longtime associate in the State Senate, Randy Kuhl, get elected to Congress in 2004. Kuhl had served as state senator in a neighboring district to McGee's. In addition to her legislative work, McGee was also a frequent columnist. Her columns, more than simply press releases, were published in the Cattaraugus County Chronicle and later on her own Web site. Death and legacy On April 2, 2005, McGee died at Kenmore Mercy Hospital in Kenmore, New York due to pulmonary fibrosis. To this day, McGee is seen in a high regard as a New York State politician, and her status in Cattaraugus County borders on legendary. The Pat McGee Trail, the cornerstone of Cattaraugus County's trail system built on 12 miles of abandoned railbed from Cattaraugus, New York to Salamanca, New York, bears her name. McGee was succeeded in the State Senate by Catharine Young.

During counter-scanning two surface scans, viz., direct scan and counter scan are obtained (see Fig. 1). The counter scan starts in the point where the direct scan ends. This point is called the coincidence point (CP). With the counter scan, the probe movement along the raster line and the probe movement from one raster line to the other raster line are carried out along the directions that are opposite to the movements in the direct scan. The obtained pair of images is called counter-scanned images (CSIs). Principles When the raster distortions are linear, i. e., when the drift velocity is constant, to correct drift, it is sufficient to measure coordinates of only one common feature in the direct and the counter scans. In case of nonlinear distortion, when the drift velocity varies during the scan, the number of common features on CSIs whose coordinates need to be measured increases in proportion to the degree of the nonlinearity. Typically, the drift of the microscope probe relative to the measured surface consists of two components: one is associated with creep of the scanner piezoceramics, the other is caused by a thermal deformation of the instrument due to change in temperature. The first component is nonlinear (it can be approximated by logarithm), the second component can be considered as linear in most practical applications. The use of the counter-scanning method allows, even in the case of a strong drift leading to errors in tens of percents, measuring the surface topography with error of few tenths of a percent.

Counter-scanning with (a) an idle line (shown by the dotted line), (b) no idle line. Digits 1…4 designate the numbers of the images obtained. 1, 3 are direct images, 2, 4 are counter images corresponding to the direct ones. CP is a coincidence point of the counter-scanned image pair. The raster presented conditionally consists of four lines. Counter- scanned images Counter-scanned images (CSI, CSIs) are a pair of images obtained during counter-scanning. During the counter-scanning it is possible to obtain one or two pairs of CSIs (see Fig. 1). Each pair consists of a direct image and the image counter to it. First, a conventional image is obtained called the direct image, after that a counter image is obtained by reversing the movement direction along a raster line and the movement direction from line to line of the raster. The direct image of the second pair is formed by the retrace lines of the direct image of the first pair. The counter image of the second pair is formed by the retrace lines of the counter image of the first pair. CSIs are intended for correction of distortions caused by drift of the scanning microscope probe relative to the surface under investigation. To implement correction, it is sufficient to have at least one common feature between the direct and the counter images. As compared to a single CSI pair, the use of two pairs requires twice as much memory and processing time but on the other hand it allows increasing precision of correction and reducing noise level in the corrected image.

Biography Murdoch, a prop, played for Otago from 1964 to 1972, except for one season each for Hawke's Bay (1965) and Auckland (1966). He represented New Zealand from 1970 to 1972, playing in 27 matches for the All Blacks, including three test matches. He toured with the All Blacks to South Africa on the 1970 tour and to Great Britain and Ireland on the 1972 tour, but was troubled by injury throughout both series. Murdoch's career ended controversially after he was sent home from tour. He scored the All Blacks' only try in their 1972 win against Wales in Cardiff, but later the same night was involved in a fracas in which he punched security guard Peter Grant at the Angel Hotel. He also played in famous Llanelli v New Zealand match in which the Scarlets spectacularly won 9–3. He was later sent home from the tour by All Black management, reputedly after pressure was brought to bear by the home rugby unions. Although reporters waited in Auckland at the airport for his flight to arrive, he instead switched flights in Singapore on a stop- over, and flew to Perth, from where he headed into the Outback, quitting rugby forever. He was always invited to All Black rugby reunions, and a chair was always left empty for him should he turn up, although he never did. To this day, whenever the All Blacks visit Cardiff, they have an informal meeting nicknamed 'The Murdoch Memorial' at the Angel Hotel. New Zealand Rugby tried hard to locate him but failed: in the 50 years after his disappearance, he was only traced by journalists four times. New Zealand rugby journalist Terry McLean traced him to an oil rig near Perth in 1974, but was ignored and dismissed by Murdoch. Six years later, he was back in New Zealand, working on an Otago farm when he saved a 3-year-old child from drowning in a backyard swimming pool by providing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. After the local newspaper heard and came to the farm to interview him, he moved back to Australia. Margot McRae, an ABC producer, located him in Tully, a remote town in Northern Australia. When she interviewed him, he explained that leading a nomadic life and always being on the move was exactly how he wanted to live. When McRae returned the next day with a camera crew, Murdoch ran away. In 2001 Murdoch came to public attention in connection with an inquest into the death of an Aboriginal man, Christopher Kumanjai Limerick, who was found dead at an abandoned mine. The cause of death was not certain because of decomposition, but he seems to have fallen when attempting to reach water at the bottom of the mine. The coroner suspected that he may have been forcibly taken from the town of Tennant Creek and abandoned at the mine in the heat without food or water, saying that there was evidence of assault. The last time he was seen in the town was when trying to break into a house where Murdoch and others resided, and Murdoch had allegedly chased him away. Murdoch remarked after Limerick's disappearance that \\"I don't think he'll come back.\\" Initially, Murdoch could not be located, but was subsequently called in as a critical witness. Police eventually tracked him down to a remote cattle station hundreds of miles away, and he came to give evidence, refusing all questions from reporters. He was criticised by the coroner for the cavalier manner in which he gave his evidence, and the coroner alleged that he was lying in order to protect himself and any associates from being charged with a crime. No charges were laid due to lack of evidence. Murdoch spent his last years living in the Western Australian town of Carnarvon, where he died on 27 February 2018. He was posthumously awarded his rugby test cap. His local \\"drinking mates\\" did not know of his rugby past. He lived for a year in New Zealand in the 1970s. Ernie Todd the team manager in 1972 later regretted changing his first decision to keep him in the team. Legacy A play, Finding Murdoch by Margot McRae, which premiered in Wellington in 2007, is about McRae's tracking down of Murdoch. She says of the media frenzy when he punched a security guard that \\"If there's a baddie it would be the media\\". Some 1972 team-mates feel guilty about not supporting him.

It is also the largest public enterprise in the country employing nearly 3,000 people, while another 200,000 or more depend on it for their livelihood in rural sugar cane belts of Fiji. It operates four sugar mills, the Lautoka mill, the Rarawai mill in Ba District, Fiji the Penang mill in Rakiraki in Viti Levu, and the Labasa mill in Vanua Levu. The mill in Lautoka is the largest in Fiji and once held the title of being the largest sugar mill in the southern hemisphere. The FSC was incorporated by an Act of Parliament in 1972, and officially came to existence on April 1, 1973. As of May 31, 2009, of the 44,399,998 fully paid shares, the government owned 30,239,160 shares (68.1%), and statutory bodies, local public companies and individuals held the rest of the shares. FSC has a board of directors appointed by the government, and the board acts as a policy-making and governing body. It is managed and staffed predominantly by Fiji citizens. Following independence from the Great Britain, Colonial Sugar Refining Company continued to act as Fiji's sugar marketing agent overseas until 1976 when the government formed Fiji Sugar Marketing Company, Ltd. to handle marketing activities. FSC has its head office in Lautoka. With farmers wanting more say in their dealings with FSC, the government decided on reforms within the industry. The Sugar Industry Act of 1984 restructured the industry and established three new organizations: the Sugar Commission of Fiji, the Sugar Industry Tribunal and the Sugar Cane Growers Council. It also established the Mill Area Committees as an advisory body on local sugar matters. The Sugar Commission is the coordinating body, and the Tribunal adjudicates contractual relations between farmers and FSC, as well as any disputes among the parties. The Sugar Cane Growers Council acts on behalf of farmers, and trade unions represent interests of FSC employees. One of the major functions of the Sugar Industry Tribunal is to establish and regulate master awards controlling contractual relationship between FSC and cane farmers. The master award came into effect on November 23, 1989. It replaced the sugar cane contract. Independent arbitrators who had set the contract terms were Sir Malcolm Eve (later, Lord Silso) and a judge, Lord Denning, both British. Soon after it took over assets of Colonial Sugar Refining Company, FSC embarked upon expansion of Fiji's milling capacity. The four mills are currently capable of manufacturing more than 500,000 tonnes of sugar per season. Some consideration has been given to increase mill capacity up to 600,000 tonnes a year. Such expansion would require substantial investment. Under the Seaqaqa cane development scheme, over 5,000 hectares were brought under cane by 1980. This project cost $22 million and accommodated 800 ethnic Fijian and Ind-Fijian farmers. Funds were borrowed from the World Bank to help finance the project. The government recognizes the problem of being excessively dependent on just one crop. The government has, among other measures, encouraged tourism in an effort to diversify the economy. However, tourism is sensitive to a number of factors, and its contribution to the economy is still less than that of sugar. The corporation has availed Line of Credit worth $55.78 million granted by India.

Although John's exact origins are obscure, he seems to have come from a branch of the old native comital family of Carrick. Later evidence suggests he was a graduate of canon law, but the university is not known. He was Chancellor of the diocese of Glasgow by the early 1360s, during the episcopate of William Rae (1339–1367), and held Moffat parish church in Annandale as a prebend. In political circles, he was associated with Archbald the Grim, Lord of Galloway; perhaps with the latter's assistance, he rose in royal service during the 1360s, as Clerk of the Wardrobe, Keeper of the Privy Seal and then in 1370 Chancellor of Scotland. Despite the death of David II of Scotland and accession of Robert II of Scotland in 1371, John remained Chancellor. In 1370 he was given the royal nomination to fill the vacant see of Dunkeld, which was free because of the death of John Luce that year. He failed, however, to secure papal approval, and the Pope instead provided Michael de Monymusk to the Bishopric. Carrick continued in royal service until 1377, after which it appears he was allowed to retire on the revenues of the burgh of Lanark. His death can probably be placed in 1380.

Career Meade was born in Islington, where he attended Tollington Park Secondary School. He played football for Islington Boys, and began his club career at Arsenal as a schoolboy. He turned professional in June 1980, and was prolific for the club's reserve side: with 90 goals from 130 appearances in the Football Combination, he was the leading scorer in both the 1980–81 and 1981–82 seasons. Meade made his first-team debut on 16 September 1981 in a UEFA Cup first round tie away to Panathinaikos; entering the match after 66 minutes with his team 1–0 up, he scored the second goal with a bicycle kick with what the Daily Express reported as his first touch of the ball. On his league debut, in the starting eleven against Manchester City on 17 October, he scored the only goal of the match. Of his sixteen appearances in that season's First Division (eight as substitute), most were made from mid-February 1982 onwards. Select season required via bottom navbar. He scored twice against Brighton & Hove Albion on his return from a cartilage injury in February 1983, but played only six more matches that season. In December 1983, he scored a winning hat- trick against Watford and his two goals against Tottenham Hotspur in the North London Derby at White Hart Lane helped Arsenal to a 4–2 win, but he failed to score in any of his other 12 appearances. The signings of Paul Mariner and Charlie Nicholas meant Meade had been pushed down the pecking order at Arsenal, and he made only eight appearances in 1984–85, taking his totals to 16 goals from 51 matches in all competitions. He was sold to Sporting CP in the summer of 1985. In his debut season, Meade scored twice against Athletic Bilbao to help his team reach the quarter-finals of the 1985–86 UEFA Cup, produced hat-tricks against Académica Coimbra and Vitória Guimarães, and finished the campaign with 13 goals from 26 appearances in all competitions. He produced 20 goals from 33 appearances the following season, including 2 in Sporting's 9–0 UEFA Cup defeat of ÍA, and helped Sporting reach the 1987 Taça de Portugal Final, in which they lost to Benfica. He fell out of favour in the third year of his contract with Sporting, and joined Real Betis on loan for the second half of the 1987–88 La Liga season. He made just one start, in a 4–1 win away at Espanyol in early February, and two substitute appearances, In August 1988 Meade left Sporting CP to sign for Scottish Premier Division club Dundee United for £150,000. He scored 7 goals from 22 appearances, which included a winning goal against Floriana that took Dundee United through to the second round of the Cup Winners' Cup, and attracted enough attention for a local fanzine to publish a controversial \\"supposedly racist\\" image of him. In March 1989, Meade moved on to Luton Town, for whom he made 4 appearances and was an unused substitute on the losing side in the 1989 Football League Cup Final. Meade's next employer was Danish club Odense BK, from where he had brief spells back in England with Ipswich Town and Plymouth Argyle. In August 1991, Meade signed for Brighton & Hove Albion where he became a regular in the side and scored 12 goals from 46 appearances in all competitions. Released at the end of the season, he turned out for the reserve teams of several clubs and spent time with Hong Kong team Ernest Borel before returning to England, first with Dover Athletic and then for a second spell with Brighton & Hove Albion. He then played for Sussex County League club Southwick and for Southern League clubs Crawley Town, where he top-scored in the 1995–96 season,, and and Sittingbourne.

It is Albertson’s final live-action film role before his death six months after the film’s release. The film focuses on a small town wherein a few tourists are murdered, but their corpses begin to reanimate. With a screenplay written by Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett, the movie was initially banned as a \\"video nasty\\" in the U.K. in the early 1980s, but was later acquitted of obscenity charges and removed from the Director of Public Prosecutions' list. The film made little money at the box office, but has received praise from critics regarding Stan Winston's special effects and Albertson's performance. In addition to the film being subsequently novelized by Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, the film has obtained a cult following in the years since its release. Plot An amateur photographer arrives in coastal Potters Bluff to practice his craft. A beautiful woman offers to model for him, but when he accepts her invitation to have sex, a mob of townspeople beat him and set him afire. The man survives the attack, but is later killed by the woman posing as a nurse in the hospital. More visitors are murdered by the townspeople. Sheriff Dan Gillis (James Farentino), assisted by Dobbs (Jack Albertson), the eccentric local coroner-mortician, works hard to discover the motive for the killings. Gillis becomes increasingly disconcerted as a grisly death occurs every day. In each case, the killers photograph the victims as they are murdered. Gillis's investigations are complicated by the bizarre behavior of his wife, Janet (Melody Anderson). Gillis accidentally hits someone with his squad car following an attack. On the grill of his car, Gillis finds the twitching severed arm of the accident victim, who attacks him and flees with the arm. After the attack, Gillis scrapes some flesh from the vehicle and takes it to the local doctor, who tells him that the tissue sample has been dead approximately four months. Gillis grows suspicious of Dobbs and conducts a background check. He discovers that Dobbs was formerly the chief pathologist in Providence, Rhode Island, until he was dismissed ten years before for conducting unauthorized experiments in the county morgue. Gillis confronts Dobbs, who admits he has developed a secret technique for reanimating the dead, and all of the townspeople are reanimated corpses under his control. Dobbs considers himself an \\"artist\\" who uses his reanimated to murder the living in order to create more corpses for him to create art with. Even Janet is a reanimated corpse. When she appears in Dobbs's office, Gillis shoots and mortally wounds her, then shoots Dobbs as well. He follows her into the cemetery, where she pleads with him to bury her in an open grave. After he does as she asks, the rest of the townspeople come to pay their respects. Gillis returns to Dobbs's office to discover that Dobbs has used his technique on himself. Dobbs then shows Gillis a film of Janet stabbing him to death as the townspeople and Dobbs watch. As Gillis stares at his own decomposing hands, Dobbs offers to repair them.

History Only a few mediaeval chapels survived the destruction of over fifty others at the hands of the Reformers in the 16th century. This is one of the few remaining with the exception of some Manorial Chapels, and those at La Hougue Bie. The name of the chapel is the Chapelle-ès-Pêcheurs, and it was originally thought to be associated with the fishing guilds said to have existed in the Island.Tabb, Balleine More convincingly, Warwick Rodwell has suggested that \\"pêcheurs\\" (fishermen) is a corruption of \\" pécheurs\\" (sinners); this agrees with his archaeological investigations which show the chapel to have been a \\"chantry chapel\\", i.e. a chapel funded by a local family to say masses for the souls of the dead. There is no evidence of \\"fishing guilds\\". The walls of this ancient chapel are reputed to date from the middle of the 6th century; some authorities give a later date. Annunciation in the Fisherman's Chapel The archaeological work done by Warwick Rodwell place the date of the chapel well after the construction of the main Parish church; because it is smaller, and has no later architectural accretions, it has a more ancient appearance, but this is in fact superficial. However, Rodwell suggests that a primitive wooden structure may have existed on this site as the first \\"St Brelade's Church\\"; this was replaced by the core of the present church in stone, with a site better suited for expansion, the first being used for worship while the second was being built. The wooden structure was then rebuilt as a secondary focus of worship, and later taken over as a Chantry chapel. The material used in the building is the same as was used in the Parish Church: limpet shells crushed and dissolved with boiling sea-water. The mode of procedure was as follows : they first erected their walling, cased the same on all sides, and then poured the liquid lime-mortar into the wall-work. The stone roof was raised in the 14th century. The clergy of that period evidently found the roof too low and squat for wall paintings. These were discovered in 1918. After a severe storm, colour was revealed on the ceiling and a picture of the \\"Assumption\\" was seen, but in a damaged condition. But underneath the plaster was found another painting, 'The Annunciation\\", of about 1310–1315 A.D. At the foot of this painting are seen fourteen figures, supposedly members of an old Jersey family, the head of which had paid for this painting. The floor was restored to its earlier level in the 1980s to the Mediaeval level, and the \\"low, squat\\" aspect of the chapel which appears in early photographs is now gone, as the proper proportions can be seen. Resurrection in the Fisherman's Chapel Part of another picture of the Annunciation is to be seen on the south wall behind the arch. A short distance westwards is to be seen the Blessed Virgin's hand clasped on a book resting on a Lectern. Nearby is seen the head of one of the Magi, with the name \\" Melchior \\" above it, and close by another of the Wise Men bearing the inscription \\"les Mages\\". Between the Wise Men, the body and legs of a chain-mailed soldier is quite distinct. On the west wall the subject is the \\" Resurrection \\" and the \\"Last Judgement\\". Over the north door is a picture of Herodes Roy—King Herod ; close by is another: \\" The Scourging of Christ \\". On the North ceiling over the door is a picture of our Lord \\" Riding upon an Ass \\" ; close by is a picture of a Roman soldier. On the south ceiling in the little Chancel, portions of Adam and Eve and the children are to be seen. Early histories of the Parish Church of St Brelade J.A. Balleine, W. Tabb made a mistaken identification with Saint Brendan which is undoubtedly wrong. Saint Brelade was also known as Saint Branwalader, and has no connection with St Brendan. However, as a result of this the stained glass windows in the Fisherman's Chapel portray scenes from the life of Saint Brendan. References Bibliography  * The Fisherman's Chapel, J.A.

Fashion design At the beginning of the 1980s he was involved in the fashion industry, and owned a company in London throughout the 1980s which designed ladies' fashion garments. As owner he became interested in the whole lifecycle of garment production and learned how to make the garments himself. Melling has had ambitions to launch a brand. Melling's factory and company were based in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, however the launch of the Wildcat coincided with one of the worst recessions the automotive business has had. The company also had a major problem in finding employees with the level of skill to make the components: a problem which would have been solved by the purchase of TVR. At this point, in an attempt to turn the business around, Melling and his wife decided to move everything to the Autodromo do Algarve in Portugal, where a deal was completed on factory space. Towards the end of negotiations his wife died. Norton This project started when Melling was approached by an American, John Silseth II, who ran an investment brokerage business and was enthusiastic about motorbikes. He met someone in London who founded March racing cars – Robin Herd. Silseth suggested to him that he could get some manufacturers and a designer to make a world superbike using the March name: he then obtained the rights to it and decided it was perfect for the American market. Having done that he finalised a contract with Melling to design the engines for this range of superbikes and contacted a Formula One team to produce the bike. Melling's company went ahead and designed this range of engines, and after discussions with the Formula One team it became apparent that they were not capable of fulfilling their contract, and so this was transferred to the Melling team as well. At this time, a real estate company run by the Aquilini family in Vancouver, who owned the rights to Norton motorcycles, approached Silseth to do a contract whereby the March bikes would carry the Norton name instead, and the Aquilini family would draw royalties from production sales. The deal was completed and a year later the centenary of Norton came round – 1998. It was suggested by Melling, who was the Technical Director of Norton and a major shareholder, having invested £4.5M – that a special design of the motorbike should be produced. Originally Melling was commissioned to design four Norton motorcycles: the Manx, the Nirvana, the Buffalo and the Nemesis. The 750cc in-line four motorcycle, to be called the Manx, was then on test – all the tooling having been completed. Melling suggested for the centenary that the new motorcycle should be a V8 – which was basically two 750cc joined in a V – becoming a 1500cc. It was also envisaged that this V8 engine could be made into a 2-litre engine, being ideal for small sports or racing cars. However, Norton motors failed. There was a court case held for the appointment of blame in London. This was not attended by the certain two investors pulling out – and Melling was awarded all the rights of the project and possession of the tooling of the new Manx, Nirvana, Buffalo and Nemesis bikes. The prototype Nemesis and a test engine are now on view at the National Motorcycle Museum near Birmingham, England. Formula One Melling became involved in Formula One in 1989 and subsequently worked as a consultant to companies such as Lamborghini, Chevrolet, Leyton House Formula One and Benetton. Melling was involved with the development of an engine for the MasterCard Lola team for the 1997 season, but the new team folded after one race without running the engine. Some elements of the engine design were sold to Monte Carlo Automobile, and also to a company in America where that engine and the 4-valve Silk Cut Jaguar engine technology was used in design of the new Aston Martin V12. Rolls Royce/Bentley bid Melling was approached by Professor Donald Longmore, a keen fan of Rolls Royce/Bentley. They came to an agreement, along with John Richards, that they would organise a consortium to finance a buyout bid of Rolls Royce – this being offered for sale by the Vickers Group. During the course of obtaining the funds the sale being operated by Lasard's of London, a business plan was organised by Melling for the future of the company. This was accepted by the consortium, and a meeting was arranged with the shareholders for the following Friday morning to put forward an offer. They were also informed that an offer was going to be made by BMW/VW, and another offer by Ford had already been rejected. The overriding reason for the consortium was not just to try to keep the company under British ownership, but also that the owner would have control of the pricing of the luxury car market, and it was important to have that control in Britain. It was all agreed and the funds were laid out in a Swiss bank where the consortium raised £550M, and the meeting with Lasard's and the shareholders was to have been at 11.30am on the following Friday morning. However, when they arrived at this time BMW/VW had already met with them, and their offer had been immediately accepted. This caused great consternation with not only the consortium, but many other influential people in Britain. After Melling's bid to secure Rolls Royce lost out to a German buyer, he was asked by other members of his consortium to build a new luxury car that would be quintessentially British, and fill the void left by sale of Rolls Royce/Bentley. Momentum gathered behind this idea as certain members of the British establishment, including a central member of the British nobility, gave their support. Melling proceeded to design the car, called the Melling Xavier, and make deals to form another technical consortium to fit the car, including Cartier, Asprey's and Alfred Dunhill. The project fell apart after some time, leaving Melling with a V12 engine which was completed and running, but could not be put to commercial use: he suffered hefty financial losses. Melling Consultancy Design, (MCD) His team played a part in TWR's V12 engine which helped Jaguar win Le Mans four years on the run, and he has always wanted his own car in the world's most exciting road race. \\"The sale of the Hellcat would enable me to take a team to Le Mans but doing so has proved elusive\\" he said. Rochdale based MCD designed the AJP8 and AJP6 which TVR developed into the TVR Speed Six engine – a high-torque, 24 valve canted straight six – which was cheaper to produce and more refined for road cars. Although TVR carried out further extensive in house development of the engines, these landmark power plants proved that MCD could finally produce an engine. MCD's work ranged from outboard motors and motorcycle engines to the still born Formula One engine. The F1 engine, which features four valves and three tiny MCD designed spark plugs per cylinder, fell behind in its schedule leading to the Mastercard Lola formula one team not qualifying for the 1997 season. Melling and his team of draftsmen have tried F1 engine designs on several occasions. Working for Scott Russell Engines, a conventional 90-degree V8 was built and tested but never got into a Grand Prix car. Another design, purely on paper, was to have been a wide 165-degree angle V12 to be built with General Motors support but GM withdrew and the project died. The V10 design that was ultimately intended for the MasterCard Lola GP never appeared in 1997 leaving the team to run with customer Ford EC V8 engines. This project sank together with the Lola GP team in the beginning of 1997. 1175bhp 6-litre V10-powered sports car Melling's concept, The Hellcat car is said to have 1175 hp delivered by a 6-litre V10 engine with the block and heads milled from solid billets of aluminium rather than cast. Taking influence from TVRs, the car is front-engined with rear-wheel-drive using a fibreglass monocoque body and box section steel chassis, independent wishbone suspension and a six speed trans-axle, from the Chevrolet Corvette. Its weight is estimated at 1,200 kg, with coming up in an F1-rivalling 2.8 seconds, and a Vmax of 200 mph-plus. Melling planned a GT1 version to challenge Aston Martins, Vipers and Corvettes at Le Mans in 2007. The cabin is race-inspired with deep bucket seats, harnesses and carbon trim. The plan was for only 50 a year to be produced in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, and sold through one national dealer. So far, the Hellcat and its power plant remain on the drawing board. An early concept car made on the chassis of the TVR Cerbera and powered by a standard TVR AJP8, underwent tests in California, the biggest market being in the United States. Melling is quoted to have said: \\"A market survey revealed the Hellcat would look best in silver, so you can have it any colour – as long as it is silver.\\" At the launch of the \\"AJP8 Hellcat\\" code named JS1, Melling said: \\"The Hellcat would be the climax of my career – the car I've been working towards all my life. One day, God willing, one of my designs will be in production\\" Melling Wildcat The Melling Wildcat is a high performance roadster. The first prototype was completed in 2008 and production is scheduled in America and the UK in 2009. The Wildcat is powered by either the 4.5 litre AJP8 V8 producing 440BHP or a tuned 5.7 litre version of the Chevrolet small-block V8 producing over . Its styling is similar to the TVR Griffith. Initially a proposed 150 units was supposed to be completed a year, with production starting in 2009; this did not happen. Cruiser bikes The smaller of the bikes, The Monos (which is Greek for 'The Only One'), has an engine size of approximately 2.5 litres. The Titan, a copy of a bike that Melling had initially made for himself, where he sculpted the cylinders of the engine to look like the American fighter planes of the Second World War. Melling had a contract to redesign the Indian Motorcycle engine in America. Subsequently, his company began production on this range of heavy cruiser motorcycles similar to Viper/Indian/Harley Davidson.

Career 1968 Triumph Herald Harry Webster was born in Coventry in 1917, and educated at Welshpool County School and Coventry Technical College. He stayed in Coventry to join the Standard Motor Company in 1932 as an apprentice, spending six years in Standard's aircraft engineering operation during the Second World War, after which he returned to the car chassis design department in Coventry. Following Standard's acquisition of the Triumph Motor Company in 1946, Webster's design and chassis engineering abilities helped to revive the Triumph marque through the 1950s. In 1957 Webster became Triumph's director of engineering, and in 1967 he was appointed chief executive engineer at Leyland Motors, which had by then acquired Standard-Triumph. In 1968, following the merger of British Motor Holdings and Leyland Motors to form British Leyland Motor Corporation (BLMC) he succeeded Alec Issigonis as BLMC's technical director. Webster worked on Triumph's TR series of sports cars, which included the TR2, TR3, TR4, and TR5 (the first British sports car to have fuel injection fitted as standard) and brought in Italian stylist Giovanni Michelotti to work with him on the TR4, Herald, Vitesse, Spitfire, 2000, and Stag. In 1974 he was appointed CBE for his contribution to the motor industry, and the same year, after resigning from BLMC he joined Leamington Spa-based brake and clutch manufacturer Automotive Products as group technical director. He retired in 1982 and lived in Kenilworth, where he had moved to in the late 1950s, until his death in 2007.

The name coral is somewhat misleading, as fire corals are not true corals but are instead more closely related to Hydra and other hydrozoans, making them hydrocorals. They make up the only genus in the monotypic family Milleporidae. Distinguishing characteristics Fire corals have a bright yellow-green and brown skeletal covering and are widely distributed in tropical and subtropical waters. They appear in small brush-like growths on rocks and coral. Divers often mistake fire coral for seaweed, and accidental contact is common. Upon contact, an intense pain can be felt that can last from two days to two weeks. The very small nematocysts on fire corals contain tentacles that protrude from numerous surface pores (similar to jellyfish stings). In addition, fire corals have a sharp, calcified external skeleton that can scrape the skin. Fire coral has several common growth forms; these include branching, plate, and encrusting. Branching adopts a calcareous structure which branches off, to rounded, finger-like tips. Plate growth adopts a shape similar to that of the smaller nonsheet lettuce corals - erect, thin sheets, which group together to form a colony. In encrusting growth, the fire coral forms on the calcareous structure of other coral or gorgonian structures. The gonophores in the family Milleporidae arise from the coenosarc (the hollow living tubes of the upright branching individuals of a colony) within chambers embedded entirely in the coenosteum (the calcareous mass forming the skeleton of a compound coral). Distribution and habitat Fire corals are found on reefs in the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans and the Caribbean Sea.Veron, J.E.N. (2000) Corals of the World. Vol. 3. Australian Institute of Marine Sciences, Townsville, Australia. They form extensive outcrops on projecting parts of the reef where the tidal currents are strong. They are also abundant on upper reef slopes and in lagoons,Veron, J.E.N. (1986) Corals of Australia and the Indo-Pacific. Angus and Robertson Publishers, UK. and occur down to 40 m deep. Biology The polyps of fire corals are near microscopic size and are mostly embedded in the skeleton and connected by a network of minute canals. All that is visible on the smooth surface are pores of two sizes: gastropores and dactylopores. In fact, Millepora means ‘thousand pores’. Dactylozooids have long fine hairs that protrude from the skeleton. The hairs possess clusters of stinging cells and capture prey, which is then engulfed by gastrozooids, or feeding polyps, situated within the gastropores. As well as capturing prey, fire corals gain nutrients via their special symbiotic relationship with algae known as zooxanthellae. The zooxanthellae live inside the tissues of the coral, and provide the coral with food, which they produce through photosynthesis, so require sunlight. In return, the coral provides the algae with protection and access to sunlight. Reproduction in fire corals is more complex than in other reef-building corals. The polyps reproduce asexually, producing jellyfish-like medusae, which are released into the water from special cup-like structures known as ampullae. The medusae contain the reproductive organs that release eggs and sperm into the water. Fertilised eggs develop into free-swimming larvae that will eventually settle on the substrate and form new colonies. Fire corals can also reproduce asexually by fragmentation.Wood, E.M. (1983) Reef corals of the world: biology and field guide. T.F.H. Publications, New Jersey, USA.Wilkinson, C. (2004) Status of Coral Reefs of the World. Australian Institute of Marine Science, Townsville, Australia. Threats and conservation Fire corals face the many threats impacting coral reefs globally, including poor land management practices releasing more sediment, nutrients, and pollutants into the oceans and stressing the fragile reef ecosystem. Overfishing has ‘knock-on’ effects that result in the increase of macroalgae that can outcompete and smother corals, and fishing using destructive methods physically devastates the reef. A further potential threat is the increase of coral bleaching events, as a result of global climate change.Wilkinson, C. (2004) Status of Coral Reefs around the Word. Australian Institute of Marine Science, Townsville, Australia. Most fire coral species have brittle skeletons that can easily be broken, for example, during storms, or by divers when diving for leisure, or when collecting fish for the aquarium trade. For instance, the yellowtail damselfish (Chrysiptera parasema) tends to dwell close to the branching fire coral colonies, and retreats into its branches when threatened. In Brazil, fire coral colonies are extensively damaged when harvesting the yellowtail damselfish, as the corals are often deliberately smashed and fishes hiding amongst the branches are ‘shaken out’ into plastic bags.Gasparini, J.L., Floeter, S.R., Ferreira, C.E.L. and Sazima, I.

Development Cook Brothers had developed an unusual vehicle for desert conditions. This had two four-wheel-drive bogies each with its own engine. Steering was by pivoting the front bogie. They then developed their design into a tank destroyer with two engines at the rear. There was sufficient interest from the Army for a contract for development as the T55.

Biography Johann Eberhard Faber was born on December 6, 1822 in the village of Stein, near the city of Nuremberg, in Bavaria. His father, George Leonard Faber, was a descendant of the famous Faber family, one of ancient lineage in Bavaria engaged in the profession of manufacturing lead pencils. He did his primary schooling at a Volksschule and then enrolled to study law at the University of Heidelberg. But he left his studies mid-way to pursue a career in commerce in America. He moved to the United States in 1848 and opened a stationery store at 133 William Street in New York in 1849. He moved the store to 718-720 Broadway in 1877. In 1852, he started to export red cedar logs to the Faber pencil factories in Stein, having realized that the red cedar available in America was ideal for lead pencils. In 1861, he opened the first lead pencil factory along the East River, between 41st and 43rd streets, Midtown Manhattan. The factory was established under the name of Eberhard Faber. In 1872, a fire destroyed the factory in Manhattan, and the new Eberhard Faber Pencil Factory was built on a site on Kent and West streets in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. The new factory was designed for expansion and by the time Faber died his factory was the largest of its kind in United States and the Faber name was known all over the world. Faber died on March 2, 1879 in New York City. Faber is interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. Marriage and family On July 1, 1854, Eberhard Faber married Jenny Haag, who was born on November 23, 1836, in Munich. She was the daughter of Ludwig and Johanna (Mangstel) Haag, members of old Bavarian families.

Oxalis species are also known as sour grass, sour trefoil, and shamrock. Distribution It is native plant in much of the United States, from the Rocky Mountains east to the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico coasts, and through Eastern Canada. It has a tendency to cluster in open places in damp woods and on stream banks, and in moist prairies. The plant is listed as a threatened or endangered species in five eastern U.S. states. Description Oxalis violacea emerges in early spring from an underground bulb and produces leaf stems tall and flower clusters on stems tall. The three-part leaves have heart-shaped leaflets. It is similar in appearance to small clovers such as the shamrock. The plant bears lavender to white flowers with white to pale green centers above the foliage, during April or May, rarely to July, and, with rain, sometimes produces additional flowers without leaves from August to October. Uses=Medicinal Oxalis violacea was used as a medicinal plant by Native Americans, including the Cherokee and Pawnee peoples. Culinary All parts of the plant are edible; flowers, leaves, stems, and bulb. Oxalis is from the Greek word meaning sour, and this plant has a sour juice. It is used in salads. Moderate use of plant is advisable, as it should not be eaten in large quantities due to a high concentration of oxalic acid, (\\"salt of lemons\\") which can be poisonous. It was a traditional food source of the Native American Apache, Cherokee, Omaha, Pawnee, and Ponca peoples. Cultivation Oxalis violacea is cultivated as an ornamental plant, for use as a flowering groundcover or perennial plant in traditional and native plant gardens, and for natural landscaping projects. It spreads rapidly by runners and bulbs. In gardens the plant prefers partial shade and moisture.

The Brun family, (Montbrun after 1366), remained owners until 1516. At the start of the Hundred Years' War, the castle was occupied by the English. It was retaken by the French in 1353. At the end of the century it was taken again by the English and partially destroyed. Between 1433 and 1438, square towers were replaced with round towers and the castle took on its present form. In 1562, Montbrun was attacked by Protestants during the Wars of Religion and although it was not captured a fire raged through the castle. During the French Revolution, at the instigation of people's representatives Borie and Jacques Brival, the castle was pillaged and destroyed and the archives were burned. The property was divided up and sold as national property. Restored in 1871, it suffered a serious fire in 1916. A second restoration was carried out between 1964 and 1966.

This has made tile rendering systems particularly common for low-power handheld device use. Tiled rendering is sometimes known as a \\"sort middle\\" architecture, because it performs the sorting of the geometry in the middle of the graphics pipeline instead of near the end. Basic concept Creating a 3D image for display consists of a series of steps. First, the objects to be displayed are loaded into memory from individual models. The system then applies mathematical functions to transform the models into a common coordinate system, the world view. From this world view, a series of polygons (typically triangles) is created that approximates the original models as seen from a particular viewpoint, the camera. Next, a compositing system produces an image by rendering the triangles and applying textures to the outside. Textures are small images that are painted onto the triangles to produce realism. The resulting image is then combined with various special effects, and moved into a frame buffer, which video hardware then scans to produce the displayed image. This basic conceptual layout is known as the display pipeline. Each of these steps increases the amount of memory needed to hold the resulting image. By the time it reaches the end of the pipeline the images are so large that typical graphics card designs often use specialized high-speed memory and a very fast computer bus to provide the required bandwidth to move the image in and out of the various sub-components of the pipeline. This sort of support is possible on dedicated graphics cards, but as power and size budgets become more limited, providing enough bandwidth becomes expensive in design terms. Tiled renderers address this concern by breaking down the image into sections known as tiles, and rendering each one separately. This reduces the amount of memory needed during the intermediate steps, and the amount of data being moved about at any given time. To do this, the system sorts the triangles making up the geometry by location, allowing to quickly find which triangles overlap the tile boundaries. It then loads just those triangles into the rendering pipeline, performs the various rendering operations in the GPU, and sends the result to the frame buffer. Very small tiles can be used, 16×16 and 32×32 pixels are popular tile sizes, which makes the amount of memory and bandwidth required in the internal stages small as well. And because each tile is independent, it naturally lends itself to simple parallelization. In a typical tiled renderer, geometry must first be transformed into screen space and assigned to screen-space tiles. This requires some storage for the lists of geometry for each tile. In early tiled systems, this was performed by the CPU, but all modern hardware contains hardware to accelerate this step. The list of geometry can also be sorted front to back, allowing the GPU to use hidden surface removal to avoid processing pixels that are hidden behind others, saving on memory bandwidth for unnecessary texture lookups. There are two main disadvantages of the tiled approach. One is that some triangles may be drawn several times if they overlap several tiles. This means the total rendering time would be higher than an immediate-mode rendering system. There are also possible issues when the tiles have to be stitched together to make a complete image, but this problem was solved long ago. More difficult to solve is that some image techniques are applied to the frame as a whole, and these are difficult to implement in a tiled render where the idea is to not have to work with the entire frame. These tradeoffs are well known, and of minor consequence for systems where the advantages are useful; tiled rendering systems are widely found in handheld computing devices. Tiled rendering should not be confused with tiled/nonlinear framebuffer addressing schemes, which make adjacent pixels also adjacent in memory. These addressing schemes are used by a wide variety of architectures, not just tiled renderers. Early work Much of the early work on tiled rendering was done as part of the Pixel Planes 5 architecture (1989). The Pixel Planes 5 project validated the tiled approach and invented a lot of the techniques now viewed as standard for tiled renderers. It is the work most widely cited by other papers in the field. The tiled approach was also known early in the history of software rendering. Implementations of Reyes rendering often divide the image into \\"tile buckets\\". Commercial products – Desktop and console Early in the development of desktop GPUs, several companies developed tiled architectures. Over time, these were largely supplanted by immediate-mode GPUs with fast custom external memory systems. Major examples of this are: * PowerVR rendering architecture (1996): The rasterizer consisted of a 32×32 tile into which polygons were rasterized across the image across multiple pixels in parallel. On early PC versions, tiling was performed in the display driver running on the CPU. In the application of the Dreamcast console, tiling was performed by a piece of hardware. This facilitated deferred rendering—only the visible pixels were texture-mapped, saving shading calculations and texture-bandwidth. * Microsoft Talisman (1996) * Dreamcast (powered by PowerVR chipset) (1998) * Gigapixel GP-1 (1999) * Intel Larrabee GPU (2009) (canceled) * PS Vita (powered by PowerVR chipset) (2011) * Nvidia GPUs based on the Maxwell architecture and later architectures (2014) *AMD GPUs based on the Vega (GCN5) architecture and later architectures (2017) *Intel Gen11 GPU and later architectures (2019)https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/db/88/The- Architecture-of-Intel-Processor-Graphics- Gen11_R1new.pdfhttps://twitter.com/intelnews/status/1126251762657124358https://newsroom.intel.com/wp- content/uploads/sites/11/2019/05/10th-Gen-Intel-Core-Product-Brief.pdf Examples of non-tiled architectures that use large on-chip buffers are: * Xbox 360 (2005): the GPU contains an embedded 10 MiB eDRAM; this is not sufficient to hold the raster for an entire 1280×720 image with 4× multisample anti- aliasing, so a tiling solution is superimposed when running in HD resolutions and 4× MSAA is enabled. * Xbox One (2013): the GPU contains an embedded 32 MiB eSRAM, which can be used to hold all or part of an image. It is not a tiled architecture, but is flexible enough that software developers can emulate tiled rendering. Commercial products – Embedded Due to the relatively low external memory bandwidth, and the modest amount of on-chip memory required, tiled rendering is a popular technology for embedded GPUs. Current examples include: Tile-based immediate mode rendering (TBIM): * ARM Mali series. * Qualcomm Adreno (series 300 and newer can also dynamically switch to immediate/direct mode rendering via FlexRender). Tile-based deferred rendering (TBDR): * Arm Mali series. * Imagination Technologies PowerVR 5/6/7 series. * Broadcom VideoCore IV series. * Apple Silicon GPUs. Vivante produces mobile GPUs which have tightly coupled frame buffer memory (similar to the Xbox 360 GPU described above). Although this can be used to render parts of the screen, the large size of the rendered regions means that they are not usually described as using a tile-based architecture.

And clock tower was named Northbrook Tower after the name of Northbrook, a former viceroy of India (1872-1876). This building was completed, opened and offices shifted in 1888. Hall was named 'Jinnah Hall' after the independence of Pakistan in 1947 and it used for office meetings, cultural programs and public was also allowed to enter here. With passage of time this building became insufficient for offices and small hall was also insufficient for meetings, so offices were shifted from here.

The building is now the Legislative Museum of Kerala The Nair Brigade was the army of the erstwhile kingdom of Travancore in India. Nairs were a community of the region. The personal bodyguard of the king Marthanda Varma (1706–1758) was also called Thiruvithamkoor Nair Pattalam (Travancore Nair Army). The Travancore army was officially referred as the Travancore Nair Brigade in 1818. In the early years, only Nairs were admitted into this brigade. Later, the unit was expanded and several sub-units were formed. The name Nair Brigade remained unchanged, even following the admittance of non-Nairs. The headquarters of the brigade was in Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum). History Members of a Nair brigade The army of Travancore was modernised by Marthanda Varma, who is known as \\"the maker of modern Travancore\\".The first Commander in Chief of his army was Kumaraswamy Pillai,Travancore State Manual pdf Digital book who was a veteran soldier. Thanu Pillai, brother of then Dalawa Arumukham Pillai was made the Lieutenant Commander. He defeated the Dutch army with the Nair Brigade in 1741 at the Battle of Colachel and captured the Dutch commander Captain Eustachius De Lannoy. Marthanda Varma agreed to spare the Dutch captain's life on condition that he joined his army and trained his soldiers on modern lines. The Travancore army was reorganised as the Travancore Nair Brigade in 1818. The Travancore Army was considered a part of the Indian State Forces from 1935. The units were known as the First, Second and Third Travancore infantry. The State Forces consisted of infantry units, the State Forces Artillery, the Travancore Training Centre, the Sudarsan Guards and the State Forces Band. With the integration of the State into the Indian Union, the Nair Brigade was integrated into the Indian Army as the 9th Battalion Madras Regiment (1st Travancore) and the 16th Battalion of the Madras Regiment (2nd Travancore) in 1954.  Strength  The Nair Army of Travancore was very strong during the 1700s and 1800s. Later, with the strengthening of English East India Company, and with Travancore signing a treaty handing over defence to the Company's army, the Nair Brigade headcount was reduced. The total strength of Travancore Nair Army in 1945 was 4,082 men, of which 84 were officers and 132 were JCOs. A part of this force (those within medical categorization 'A') were absorbed into the Indian Army (Travancore - Cochin unified forces), while the remaining forces were disbanded. After the unification of Travancore and Cochin forces, Trivandrum was declared as the headquarters of the unified command. Major General V.N. Parameswaran Pillai, the GOC of the Travancore Nair army, became the commandant of the unified forces. The unified force was divided into five infantry battalions (Travancore - I, II, III and IV, Cochin I). The unification took place under Major General V.N. Parameswaran Pillai of Travancore and Lt Col G.S. Subbiah of Cochin on 20 May 1949. Finally the forces unified Travancore-Cochin forces were either disbanded or absorbed into the Indian Army and Major General V.N. Parameswaran Pillai was allowed to retire. The first group of State Forces of Cochin Kingdom was also called as the Nair Brigade in 1940. The Brigade's name was changed in 1945 to Cochin State Forces by Kerala Varma and allowed non- Nairs also to be admitted into his army. Following the integration of Travancore Army with the Indian Forces, the Pazhavangadi Ganapathi Temple in Thiruvananthapuram which the Brigade maintained and owned was likewise transferred to the Indian Army.

It was recorded on 12 October 1965 at IBC Studios, and released both as the B-side to \\"The Kids Are Alright\\" in the U.S., and as the A-side of a single that reached number 32 in the UK. Both singles were released by Shel Talmy without the permission of the Who and were a result of a legal dispute between Talmy and the band at the time and an attempt to sabotage the release of the band's chosen single \\"Substitute\\". The subject of the song is breach of promise and it marks the first time Townshend sang lead vocals, rather than Roger Daltrey, possibly because the song was too close to home for Daltrey who was divorcing his wife at the time. Who biographer John Atkins describes Townshend's voice on the song as being higher and less abrasive than Daltrey's. But Rolling Stone critic Dave Marsh thinks that although the vocal has some charm, it does not suggest that Townshend's voice would be good enough to be the band's full- time lead singer. Author Mike Segretto describes the vocal as a \\"noncommercial adenoidal croon.\\" According to Allmusic critic Stewart Mason, \\"adenoidal whine actually makes the singer sound like he's sneaking out in the dead of night, scared to death that his wife's going to catch him.\\" Atkins describes the two note guitar figure used in the introduction to the song as being \\"memorable and catchy.\\" He states that the song incorporates a \\"short, jolting rhythm\\" similar to that on their more famous song \\"My Generation.\\" Steve Grantley and Alan G. Parker state that \\"the band sound like they have been let off the leash and really let rip to create another early classic.\\" Segretto describes the melody as being \\"excellent.\\" Nicky Hopkins joins the band on piano, and Segretto claims that his \\"hyper piano runs contribute much amphetamine fuel to the song. Atkins also notes the \\"ironic humour\\" of the song. Mason also finds the song \\"funny.\\" Segretto points out that the lyrics are surprisingly misogynistic coming from Townshend, but that is softened by the \\"playful tone and cute lines like 'Just wanna keep on doing all the dirty little things I do.\\" According to Townshend the song \\"is about a guy on the run from a chick about to pin him down for breach of contract. What this song was screaming from behind lines like 'It's a legal matter, baby, marrying's no fun/It's a legal matter, baby, you got me on the run' was, \\"I'm lonely, I'm hungry, the bed needs making.' I wanted a maid, I suppose.\\" Marsh suggests that the protagonist really doesn't want to marry because \\"he's terrified of discovering who he really is (boring, middle-class and conventional.)\\" Several commentators noted an influence from the Rolling Stones on this song, particularly their song \\"The Last Time.\\" For example, Segretto states \\"A Legal Matter\\" has \\"a nagging, droning riff that may share DNA with 'The Last Time.'\\" Mason states that the song \\"proves conclusively that Pete Townshend was working on a different plane than just about every other songwriter in London in 1965.\\" The song was covered by Richard Thompson on his 2003 album 1000 Years Of Popular Music.

It is a growing problem in the developing world as cities increase in population and water use, without adequate pumping regulation and enforcement. One estimate has 80% of serious U.S. land subsidence problems associated with the excessive extraction of groundwater,USGS Fact Sheet-165-00 December 2000 making it a growing problem throughout the world. Groundwater can be considered one of the last free resources, as anyone who can afford to drill can usually draw up merely according to their ability to pump (depending on local regulations). However, as seen in the figure, pumping induced draw down causes a depression of the groundwater surface around the production well. This can ultimately affect a large region by making it more difficult and expensive to pump the deeper water. Thus, the extraction of groundwater becomes a tragedy of the commons, with resulting economic externalities. San Joaquin Valley surface change The arid areas of the world are requiring more and more water for growing populations and agriculture. In the San Joaquin Valley of the United States, groundwater pumping for crops has gone on for generations. This has resulted in the entire valley sinking an extraordinary amount, as shown in the figure.Lin II, Rong-Gong (May 14, 2014) \\"Depletion of Central Valley's groundwater may be causing earthquakes\\" Los Angeles Times This has not come without consequences. Any large-scale change of topography, no matter how slight it may seem, has the potential to drastically change the surface-water hydrology. This has happened in the Joaquin Valley and other regions of the world, such as New Orleans and Bangkok. These areas are now subject to severe flooding due to subsidence associated with groundwater removal.Timothy H. Dixon(2006) Space geodesy: Subsidence and flooding in New Orleans. Nature 441, 587-588 (1 June 2006)Dhira Phantumvanit (1989) Coming to terms with Bangkok's environmental problems. Environment and Urbanization April 1989 vol. 1 no. 1 31–39 Total subsidence can usually be determined by ground-surface elevation surveys and GPS measurements. Potential impact on the aquifers and other resulting geohazards such as fissures can be assessed through long-term hydrologic studies and models. Mexico City subsidence Groundwater-related subsidence often results in major damage to urban areas. In Mexico City, the buildings interact with the settlement, and cause cracking, tilting, and other major damage.Sinking of a titanic city, Geotimes.org, July 2001 In many places, large sinkholes open up, as well as surface cavities. Damage from Hurricane Katrina was exacerbated due to coastal sinking, associated with groundwater withdrawal. The cause of the long-term surface changes associated with this phenomenon are fairly well known.USGS: Land Subsidence From Ground- Water Pumping, S. A. Leake, Aug. 2013 As shown in the USGS figure, aquifers are frequently associated with compressible layers of silt or clay. As the groundwater is pumped out, the effective stress changes, precipitating consolidation, which is often non-reversible. Thus, the total volume of the silts and clays is reduced, resulting in the lowering of the surface. The damage at the surface is much greater if there is differential settlement, or large-scale features, such as sinkholes and fissures. Aquifer compaction is a significant concern along with pumping-induced land subsidence. A large portion of the groundwater storage potential of many aquifers can be significantly reduced when longterm groundwater extraction, and the resulting groundwater level decline, causes permanent compaction of fine sediment layers (silts and clays). A study in an arid agricultural region of Arizona showed that, even with a water level recovery of 100ft after groundwater pumping was stopped, the land surface continued to subside for decades. This is a result of the continued dewatering of aquitards (fine-grain layers that slow the movement of groundwater) from stresses mentioned in the previous paragraph. The only known method to prevent this condition is by pumping less groundwater, which is extremely difficult to enforce when many people own water wells. Attempts are being made to directly recharge aquifers but this is still a preliminary effort. Major area affected Major areas affected include the San Joaquin Valley in California, Central Arizona, Mexico City, and Jakarta, Indonesia.

Aberdeen as a city, grew up as two separate burghs: Old Aberdeen, the university and cathedral settlement, at the mouth of the River Don; and New Aberdeen, a fishing and trading settlement where the Denburn entered the Dee estuary. This is History of Aberdeen Scotland Pre-1136 Aberdeen was first settled by hunter-gatherers around 6000 BC, who established themselves around the mouths of the river Dee and river Don. Around 2000 BC the Beaker People, who built the mysterious stone circles that can be found in the Aberdeenshire area, arrived from the Rhine lands. 400 BC saw Celtic migration to the area from the north of Scotland. The Romans arrived in Aberdeenshire in the first century AD. Agricola, the Roman governor of Britannia, led a force of some 40,000 men into Caledonia in 84 AD. They fought and defeated the united armies of the Picts in the Battle of Mons Graupius, near the peak of Bennachie in Aberdeenshire. After the Romans left, the natives of Aberdeenshire began to convert to Christianity. Old Aberdeen's first church was built around 580. St Kentigern sent St Machar to convert the Picts to Christianity. St Machar's Cathedral today is named after him. It became the official seat of the bishopric of Aberdeen. 1136 to the 18th century In 1136, David I began the development of New Aberdeen north of the River Dee, and the earliest charter was granted by King William the Lion about 1179, confirming the corporate rights granted by David I, which gave trade privileges to the burgesses. This charter is the oldest surviving charter. The city received other royal charters later. In 1319, the Great Charter of Robert the Bruce transformed Aberdeen into a property owning and financially independent community. Bruce had a high regard for the citizens of Aberdeen who had sheltered him in his days of outlawry, helped him win the Battle of Barra and slew the English garrison at Aberdeen Castle. He granted Aberdeen with the nearby Forest of Stocket. The income from this land has formed the basis for the city's Common Good Fund, which is used to this day for the benefit of all Aberdonians. The city was burned by Edward III of England in 1336, but was soon rebuilt and extended, and called New Aberdeen. For many centuries the city was subject to attacks by the neighbouring lords, and was strongly fortified, but the gates were all removed by 1770. Royal charters from 1489 and 1498 created a free burgh to be administered by the church. In 1497 a blockhouse was built at the harbour mouth as a protection against the English. During the Wars of 1644-47 between the Royalists and Covenanters the city was impartially plundered by both sides. In 1644, it was taken and sacked by Royalist troops consisting of Irishmen and Highlanders after the Battle of Aberdeen. The sack of Aberdeen in 1644 by the Royalist general Montrose during the English Civil War involved uncharacteristic large-scale rape. 1647 saw the outbreak of bubonic plague, and a quarter of the population died. In 1715 the Earl Marischal proclaimed the Old Pretender at Aberdeen, and in 1745 the Duke of Cumberland resided for a short time in the city before attacking the Young Pretender. 18th and 19th centuries In the 18th century a new Town Hall was built, elegantly furnished with a marble fireplace from The Netherlands and a set of fine crystal chandeliers and sconces. The latter are still a feature in the Town House. This century also saw the beginnings of social services for the Infirmary at Woolmanhill which was opened in 1742 and the Lunatic Asylum in 1779. In the late 18th century, the council embarked on a scheme of road improvements, and by 1805 George Street, King Street and Union Street were open, the latter a feat of extraordinary engineering skill involving the partial levelling of St Catherine's Hill and the building of arches to carry the street over Putachieside. The Denburn Valley was crossed by Union Street with a single span arch of 130 ft (40 m). Along these new streets was built the nucleus of the Granite City, many of whose buildings were designed by John Smith and Archibald Simpson. Town house tower with insignia 1867 The 19th century was a time of considerable expansion. The increasing economic importance of Aberdeen and the development of the shipbuilding and fishing industries brought a need for improved harbour facilities. During this century much of the harbour as it exists today was built: Thomas Telford's extension to the North Pier in 1810–1815, Victoria Dock (completed 1848), and the South Breakwater. Such an expensive building programme had repercussions, and in 1817 the city was in a state of bankruptcy. However, a recovery was made in the general prosperity which followed the Napoleonic wars. Improvements in street lighting came in 1824 with the advent of gas, and a vast improvement was made to the water supply in 1830 when water was pumped from the Dee to a reservoir in Union Place. An underground sewerage system was begun in 1865 to replace the open sewers which previously ran along certain streets. The city was the headquarters of the Great North of Scotland Railway, located at 89 Guild Street, which was formed in 1846, becoming one of the constituents of the London and North Eastern Railway in 1923. The city was formerly served by Aberdeen Corporation Tramways, which closed in 1958. The Guild Street drill hall was completed in 1860. The Aberdeen United Trades Council was established in 1868, and soon became a prominent force in the city, sponsoring candidates for the council and campaigning for shorter working hours. The city was first incorporated in 1891. At that time the church-administered central portion and the remainder of New Aberdeen were incorporated into the present city. In 1899 the city was separated for administrative purposes from the county of Aberdeenshire, and became a \\"county of a city\\".Aberdeen Corporation Act 1899 c.lx \\"An Act to provide for the constitution of the City and Royal Burgh of Aberdeen as a County of a City, to authorise the Lord Provost, Magistrates, and Town Council of the said City and Burgh, to execute sewage works; and for other purposes\\" It remained part of the lieutenancy area of Aberdeenshire.  20th century  By 1921 the population was 158,969, and the city covered more than 6,000 acres (24 km²). George VI visited in 1925 to inaugurate the Memorial Court attached to Aberdeen Art Gallery. In 1943 during World War II, a Luftwaffe raid dropped 129 bombs on Aberdeen resulting in 125 deaths and considerable damage to the city. This event is referred to as the Aberdeen Blitz. In 1964 a food poisoning outbreak occurred, this was due to the sale of contaminated meat from a shop (William Low) which was on Union Street. The disease was typhoid. After the food poisoning outbreak the food shop closed and in the late 1980s. The name of the report of the government enquiry is the \\"Milne Report\\". In 1930 Aberdeen's status as a county of a city was confirmed by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929. In 1975, counties of cities were abolished. The area of the former county of a city was then combined with nearby rural and suburban areas of Aberdeenshire and Kincardineshire to form a district in the new Grampian Region, and a separate lieutenancy area, known as the City of Aberdeen. When districts and regions were abolished in 1996 the former district became a unitary council area, known as Aberdeen City. Today, although Old Aberdeen still has a separate charter and history, it and New Aberdeen are no longer truly distinct. The area of the city now includes the former burghs of Old Aberdeen, New Aberdeen, Woodside and the Royal Burgh of Torry to the south of the Dee.

The carnival is held during the week leading up to Ash Wednesday, and typically includes masked balls, fancy dress and grotesque mask competitions, lavish late-night parties, a colourful, ticker-tape parade of allegorical floats presided over by King Carnival (Maltese: ir-Re tal-Karnival), marching bands and costumed revellers. History Maltese carnival has been celebrated since the 1400s. The general awakening for carnival tradition has been since 1535, five years after the arrival of the Order of St John, during the reign of Piero de Ponte. It started taking place officially in Birgu. where a number of knights played games and displayed their skills in various pageants and tournaments. Grand Master Piero de Ponte complained that some knights had exaggerated in their banquets and masquerades, and there were numerous abuses and brawls. At the general assembly of knights a week later, De Ponte made it clear that he would no longer tolerate any wild excesses, especially since they came from members of a religious community. He limited himself to approving tournaments and other military exercises necessary to Christian knights to train themselves for battle against the Turks. In 1560, Grand Master Jean Parisot de Valette, felt he had to reprimand his knights for going overboard with their festivities. He had allowed the wearing of masks in public (which was forbidden in Malta for the rest of the year). The knights decorated the ships of the Order's fleet in the harbour and there was music, dance and rivalry as never seen in Malta before. La Valette was not amused at the number of people wearing masks, who had been invited to celebrate Carnival aboard the vessels and held up at the Grand Harbour in unfavourable weather conditions. Lascaris Ban In 1639, Grand Master Giovanni Paolo Lascaris issued a bando prohibiting women from wearing masks or participating in balls organised by the knights' auberges, on penalty of being publicly whipped. Another bando was that nobody could wear a costume to represent the devil. Neither the knights nor the women took kindly to the prohibitions, blaming the Jesuit Father Cassia who was the Grand Master's confessor. Some of the most spirited decided to make fun of the Jesuits. While one of the dressed as a Jesuit with offensive writings on his back, four others dressed as scoundrels who pretended to beat him mercilessly. This was reported to the Grand Master, who had the knight Girolamo Selvatico from Padua arrested, as he was believed to have organised the satire. It caused considerable unrest; the Jesuits' college was attacked and ransacked by young knights and force was used to help Selvatico escape from St James Cavalier. They demanded that Lascaris expel the Jesuits from Malta and close their church, which he did till things calmed down. Till date a Maltese idiom says \\"Wiċċ Laskri\\" (\\"Lascaris' face\\", that is, someone with a face like that of Lascaris) which is used to describe a nervous and sad person. Knights' scandals On February 27, 1664, Inquisitor Galeazzo Marescotti wrote that the traditional Carnival celebrations ended quietly that year because the knights were still mourning the death of their Grand Master Raphael Cotoner. In 1678, Inquisitor Ercole Visconti mentioned the \\"scandals\\" involving some knights during Carnival days. The Maltese were scandalised by what they saw, leading the ailing Grand Master Nicolas Cotoner to take steps after listening to Visconti's complaints. And we are told that Cotoner wasn't easily scandalised in his early years as Grand Master. On the second day of Carnival the following year two knights, named Gori and Saraceni, wearing masks, insulted Paolo Testaferrata, a depositary of the Inquisition, for no reason whatsoever. Inquisitor Giacomo Cantelmo complained to the Grand Master, who explained that it would be better to accept an apology rather than create any fuss. Saraceni went with two other knights to look for Testaferrata and excused himself saying that he had not recognised him. Than he called on Cantelmo to pay his respects. Parata True to an age-old tradition, Carnival was ushered in by the Parata which was taken very seriously both by the knights and the people in general as it was of special significance in the history of this festival. It was customary for some peasants and later companies of young dancers to gather early under the balcony of the Grandmaster's Palace in Valletta and wait eagerly until they received formal permission from him to hold the Carnival. The most recently appointed Knight Grand Cross would obtain the necessary permission and a proclamation giving the go-ahead to Carnival was immediately read from the Palace balcony. This was the sign for the general merriment to start, and the companies dressed as Christians and Turks performed a mock fight recalling the Great Siege of 1565. Then a child representing with a flag was carried shoulderhigh and taken around the streets of Valletta. Meanwhile, a stone would be hung from the Castellania, or Palace of Justice (now the Ministry of Health, in Merchants Street), as a sign that justice was \\"suspended\\" for the three days of Carnival. Inquisitor Fabrizio Serbelloni tells us that he was invited by Grand Master Antonio Manoel de Vilhena (1722–1736) to enjoy the last day of Carnival from the palace. \\"It was a popular feast attended by the Bishop and many Knights Grand Cross.\\" In fact, the Sunday afternoon défilé was usually led by the Grand Master's carriage flanked by cavalry marching to the beating of drums. Then followed other decorated open carriages, and finally came the decorated floats. Grand Master Ramon Despuig (1736–1741) was asked by the Holy Office through the Inquisitors to dedicate himself to the Order's reform. But this was never taken seriously; indeed, certain knights were frequenting women of ill repute. Inquisitor Luigi Gualterio (also spelled Ludovico Gualtieri) was not in the capacity to proceed against these knights but sent his spies to keep an eye on them. One novice, by the name of De Livry, used to organise dinners with these women. He was reported to the Grand Master, who admitted that he did not know what was happening in Malta. However the knight was arrested and he and another seven young knights, who was misbehaved during the last Carnival, were expelled from the island. Kukkanja Remains of the kukkanja in situ, in which the pole was inserted Grand Master Marc'Antonio Zondadari introduced the game of kukkanj (cockaigne) to carnival in 1721: on a given signal, the crowd assembled in Palace Square converged on a collection of hams, sausages and live animals hidden beneath leafy branches outside the guard house. The provisions became the property of those who, having seized them, were able to carry them off. British era Carnival parades during the British period, especially in the 19th and early 20th centuries, were noted for their biting satirical themes, and many of the intricate floats were designed to poke fun at political figures and unpopular government decisions; however, political satire was essentially banned as a result of a law passed in 1936. During the Carnival of 1823, about 110 children died in a human crush after attending catechism at the Convent of the Minori Osservanti on the last day of carnival. Since 1926 carnival in Malta started to be centered in the capital city of Valletta, and saw the decline in other cities and villages, with the major reasons being the regulations set by the Carnival Committee and the participation prizes awarded by it. Today The largest of the carnival celebrations mainly take place in and around the capital city Valletta and Floriana, however there are several \\"spontaneous\\" carnivals in more remote villages of Malta and Gozo. The Nadur Carnival is notable for its darker and more risqué themes including cross-dressing, ghost costumes, political figures and revellers dressed up as scantily clad clergyfolk. The Għaxaq spontaneous carnival is an original carnival organised by the inhabitants of this locality, where people wear masks and all the old- fashioned clothes that they can find in their wardrobe. Food consumed during carnival includes perlini (multi-coloured, sugar-coated almonds) and the prinjolata, which is a towering assembly of sponge cake, biscuits, almonds and citrus fruits, topped with cream and pine nuts.

Goof Troop was originally previewed on The Disney Channel in the spring of 1992 beginning on April 5.Goof Troop at Toonopedia An hour-long premiere special \\"Forever Goof\\" aired in syndication on September 5. The next week, the series became part of The Disney Afternoon, where 65 episodes (including the premiere, rerun in two parts) were broadcast during September-December 1992. At the same time, another set of 13 episodes aired on ABC's Saturday morning lineup, simply titled ABC Saturday Morning, concurrent with the weekday syndicated episodes. During the holiday season of 1992, a primetime Christmas special was aired in syndication, separate from The Disney Afternoon. The Disney Afternoon and ABC episodes constituted a single production season, but they are listed separately here. However, there seems to be a difference in content. A lot of the Disney Afternoon episodes focused mainly on the series' subplot about the good-natured Goofy driving Pete crazy without realizing it, or Pete trying to exploit or double-cross Goofy for his own good, which almost always backfires on him. As a contrast, the ABC episodes generally focused less on this conflict and more on the other family members (some episodes even showed Goofy and Pete acting almost like unlikely buddies). The Christmas special, however, showed Pete in full force in his I-hate-Goofy-and-everything-he-stands-for persona. Airdates given here reflect the Disney Afternoon and ABC airings - the Disney Channel preview airdates are not available.

As in all Plasmodium species, P. brodeni has both vertebrate and insect hosts. The vertebrate hosts for this parasite are mammals. Taxonomy The parasite was first described by Rodhain at al. in 1913. Rodhain and his colleagues were on a scientific expedition in the Katanga, Congo. As part of this expedition they examined blood of all the vertebrates they caught. In a sample of twelve elephant shrews (Petrodromus tetradactylus) captured between Bukama and Sankisia this parasite was discovered. They named the species after Broden. This parasite was rediscovered several years later by a United States Naval Medical Research Unit in elephant shrews caught in the Sudan. Over one hundred animals were found to be infected. The press reported the import by air of 'malaria infected elephants' from Africa. Distribution This species is found in the Congo, Sudan and probably in other parts of Africa.

Ballintrillick, as the area is locally known, was once one of the main sources for the mineral barytes in western Europe. It is approximately 20 minutes north from Sligo. Mining The carboniferous uplands of the Dartry mountain range have been associated with the mining of barytes ore for more than 120 years. Barytes ore is a very heavy inert mineral which makes it useful for products such as paints and pottery and its inertness the fact it blocks radiation makes it useful in nuclear power stations. The first recorded barytes mining operation in Ballintrillick was in 1858. Between then and 1979, six separate companies worked the ore. While there are deposits remaining, they are currently viewed as uneconomic to mine. The ore was transported by the use of a narrow gauge railway to the nearby fishing village of Mullaghmore from where much of the ore was exported.Gerry Foley,2009, Barytes Mining in Benbulbin References Towns and villages in County Sligo ","title":"Ballaghnatrillick"},{"id":"9592056","text":"Milestones (or Milestones to the Kingdom) is a non-commercial, Bible magazine published annually by the Christadelphians.

It was written by the Small Faces songwriting duo Steve Marriott and Ronnie Lane, and appeared on the band's 1968 concept album Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake. Against the band's wishes, it preceded the album as a single release.  Song information  \\"Lazy Sunday\\" has a traditional cockney East End of London music-hall sound. The song was inspired by Marriott's feuds with his neighbours and is also noticeable for its distinct vocal changes. Marriott sings large parts of the song in a greatly exaggerated cockney accent; he did this partly due to an argument he had with the Hollies, who said that Marriott had never sung in his own accent. In the final bridge and the last two choruses, he reverts to his usual transatlantic (singing) accent. John Lydon cited the Small Faces as one of his few influences as vocalist for the Sex Pistols, and evidence of Marriott's influence can be found in this song. According to Small Faces keyboardist Ian McLagan, Lane's \\"rooty dooty di\\" vocal lines were in imitation of a member of the Who's road crew; the two bands had recently toured Australia together. The vocal backing quotes \\"Colonel Bogey March\\" by F. J. Ricketts at 51 seconds and \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\" by the Rolling Stones at 1 minute 45 seconds. At the end of the song the tune dissolves into birdsong and church bells, which have been later sampled by Pink Floyd in \\"High Hopes\\". \\"Lazy Sunday\\" appears as track six on the album Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake, and is the last track on Side A of the vinyl release. The song was used in the 2009 British comedy film The Boat That Rocked. Music video The low-budget promotional video for \\"Lazy Sunday\\" was filmed at Kenney Jones's parents' home on Havering Street in Stepney, east London. Covers and inspiration * The song was later covered by the Toy Dolls as on their 1995 album Orcastrated. * The London-based indie rock/garage revival band The Libertines covered the song in 2003 as part of the soundtrack to British film Blackball. It is also available as part of the Blackball OST album. * Leeds-based indie rock band Kaiser Chiefs covered the song on French radio in 2008. *Jack Wild recorded a version of this song for his first studio album The Jack Wild Album.

Killi River and Karamana River flows through this area. It is one among the four legislative constituencies which are a part of Thiruvananthapuram city and is represented in the Kerala Legislative Assembly by Adv. V. K. Prasanth. It is one of the most important residential suburbs of the city and is an important link in connecting the city with several outer areas such as Kachani, Aruvikkara, Puliyarakonam, etc. It is a comparatively high-lying area of the city. Vattiyoorkavu is one of the greenest parts of the city. Other important area nearby Vattiyoorkavu are Maruthamkuzhi, Sasthamangalam, Elippodu, Kulasekharam etc. It comes under the jurisdiction of Vattiyoorkavu police station which is located in Vattiyoorkavu junction. Vattiyoorkavu has its own post office (PIN-695013), telecom Exchange and electricity (KSEB) section as well. There are regular buses to Kizhakekotta (EAST FORT) as well as other areas of the city which pass through the Vattiyoorkavu bus stop. Two auto stands and one taxi stand are also present near the junction. Etymology The name Vattiyoorkavu is believed to be derived from three words, Vatti - which means winding a hilly tract, Ooru - which means land, and Kavu - which means sacred grove. Institutions Educational institutions in the area includes Central Polytechnic College, Bharathiya Vidya Bhavan, Saraswathy Vidyalaya, A.R.R Public School,St Shanthal School Malamugal and Vattiyoorkavu Govt. Higher secondary school. One of the units of ISRO is also situated here. Unit of Geological Survey of India, C.P.W.D. quarters, Headquarters of Kerala State Centre for Advanced Printing and Training and production centre of State Nirmithi Kerndra is located here. Aruvikkara Dam is 9 km from Vattiyoorkavu. Museum, Zoo, Kowdiar Palace (Kottaram) are approximately 5 km by distance. Places of worship The stones for the renovation of Sri Padmanabha swamy temple was mined from Kulashekharam, which is in Vattiyoorkavu. The Chamundi Temple at Thozhuvancode,kadayilmudumbu Devi Temple,Sree krishna temple(kanjirampara),vimalahruthaya church, Sastha Temple, Devi temple at Puthoorkonam,saraswaathy temple (arappura) St.Peter's & St.Paul's Orthodox Syrian Church, and Juma Masjid are the old places of worship here. The mosque of Juma Masjid was built by the successors of the Muslim Cavalry soldiers of the Nair Brigade of Travancore, who had settled in Sasthamangalam and Vattiyoorkavu. Historical Demographics and Religion The predominant religious community in the area are Hindus, especially Nairs which constitute 54 per of total population, followed by Muslims, and then by Christians. This area of Travancore kingdom had been historically dominated by artisan caste people, who worked in the quarries to build the bricks, stones and masonry for the temples and palaces of Travancore kingdom in the capital city. with the development of the city, vattiyoorkavu became one of the most sought after residential areas in the city mostly for middle-class people due to the availability of most city facilities in a comparatively green and clean locality at comparatively affordable rates. In recent years, land prices have increased and several flats and apartment complexes have come up in the region and more upmarket residential areas have been created. This can be mostly attributed to the presence of large number of excellent educational institutions including Saraswathi Vidyalaya and Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan. As a result the junction and surrounding areas are now affected by regular traffic blocks. The next phase of the TRIP,trivandrum road improvement project is centred on vattiyoorkavu and aims to develop the junction as well as extend the four lane road with carriageways from sasthamangalam to peroorkada via vattiyoorkavu.

Three years later he was appointed an inspector, of schools, and five years later he left education for politics a controversial step at the time to become leader of the then fledgling Kangwane legislative assembly. That move led to his founding of the Inyandza Movement, which was to bring about political organisation and cohesion, which had been lacking in the area at the time. Inyandza Movemenent The Inyandza Movement played a critical role in preventing attempts by the South African government to incorporate the KaNgwane homeland into Swaziland. He took the South African apartheid government to court and won and this brought Mabuza national prominence. He made common cause with the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), as the territory of Ngwavuma in Northern Natal was also under threat of incorporation. His relationship with the IFP ended acrimoniously when Mabuza, in defiance of Mangosuthu Buthelezi, led a delegation to meet the ANC in Lusaka. After the 1990 unbanning of political parties, Inyandza merged into the ANC and Mabuza promptly resigned from active politics and entered the corporate world. Mabuza succumbed from pancreas cancer in 1997. ReferencesRelevant literature *Sarimana, Ashley. 2011. Trials and triumphs in public office: the life and work of E J N Mabuza.

In 1083/1672-73 Ashraf succeeded his father Khushal Khan in the chieftaincy and of the Khattak tribe, but in 1092/1681 he was betrayed into the hands of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb by his brother Bahram and died in captivity. Afzal Khan was arrested by the Mughals in 1098/1686-87 and carried to Kabul. He returned two years after the death of Khoshal Khan (1100/1689) to assume the chieftainship of the Khattak tribe, which he held for sixty-one years. Based on a reading of a tarikh in the divan of Afzal's son Kazem Khan Sayda, Sidiqullah Rishtin and A. Habibi (Paxtane su 'ara, Kabul, 1941–42, I, pp. 229–30) gave the date of Afzal's death as 1183/1769-70, but this divan had already been put into final form in 2181.2 Thus the date of his death is uncertain. H. G. Raverty's statement (Selections from the Poetry of the Afghans, London, 1867, p. 269) that Afzal, upon the assumption of the chieftainship, put his uncle (and rival) Abdul Qader to death does not bear examination; the latter translated the Golestan of Sheikh Saadi in 1124/1712. Another uncle of Afzal's; Gawhar Khan's writing in 1120/1708, gives testimony to Afzal's good chieftainship and to his consuming literary interests, which were aimed at Collecting his illustrious grandfather's works and having them copied to save them from oblivion, and Inspiring Gawhar Khan and other members of the family to use their talents in translating into Pashto some of the great works in Persian and Arabic. Afzal himself made a number of translations chiefly historical when he had ruled for twenty-five years and was fifty three years old; the Tarikh of A\`tam Kufi, the Siar of Mullah Mo'in, and a tafsir of the Koran. He began a translation of the Iar-e danes; Abu'l-Fazl's simplified Persian version of the Anwar-e Sohayly by Hosayn Wa\`ez Kashefi, which was completed in 1128/1716 under the name 'Flmkana da Danes. Afzal Khan Khattak began writing his main work, the Tarikh-e morassa, about 1120/1708. It is an uneven history of the Afghans in Pashto, compiled from various sources. The first and last parts are translations from the Persian work Makhzan-e Afghani (or Tarikh-e-Khan Jahani) written by Niamatullah in 1020/1611. The second part (about half the volume) contains an account of the Yousafzai's and kindred tribes, based mainly upon the Tazkirat- ul Abrar by Akhund Darweza, the Tabaqat-e-Akbari, the Jahangir-nama, and other Persian sources, and an extensive account of the history of the Khattaks, particularly of the author's grandfather. It includes long extracts from the bayaz (notebook) of Khushal Khan and relates events up to the year 1136/1723-24. This part of the book was used by H. G. Raverty as source material for his Notes on Afghanistan (London, 1888). Afzal Khan Khattak is buried in Ziarat Kaka Saheb near Nowshera.

Hancken batted and threw right-handed. He was born in Birmingham, Alabama. Hancken spent seven decades in professional baseball as a player, manager, coach, scout, and executive. He began his career in the minor leagues in the late 1930s with the Toledo Mud Hens and Seattle Rainiers. Then reached the Majors when manager Connie Mack knew he could catch knuckleballs and wanted him as the fourth catcher for the Philadelphia Athletics. Hancken played his only Major League game on May 14, 1940, getting a putout in the field, but he never had a chance to bat. Unfortunately, Mack sent his two knuckleballers to the minors and Hancken became expendable. From 1942 to 1946 Hancken served in the United States Marines during World War II, but he would not leave baseball behind forever. He managed ten different minor league teams, spent time as a scout for several clubs, and served as a bench coach for the Houston Astros from 1968 through 1972. He then joined the Astros front office staff in 1971 and 1991–92, being recognized as a mentor to players like Enos Cabell, Larry Dierker and Art Howe. Hancken died in Orange, Texas at the age of 92.

The Native Police were utilised as a cost-effective and brutal paramilitary instrument in the expansion and protection of the British colonial frontier in Australia. Mounted Aboriginal troopers of the Native Police, armed with rifles, carbines and swords, escorted surveying groups, pastoralists and prospectors into frontier areas. They would usually then establish base camps and patrol these areas to enforce warrants, conduct punitive missions against resisting local Aboriginal groups, and fulfil various other duties. The Aboriginal men within the Native Police were routinely recruited from areas that were very distant from the frontier places in which they were deployed. As the troopers were Aboriginal, this benefited the colonists by minimising both the wages of the police and the potential for Aboriginal revenge attacks against white people. It also increased the efficiency of the force as the Aboriginal troopers were vastly superior in their ability to track down dissidents in often poorly charted and difficult terrain. The first government funded force was the Native Police Corps, established in 1837 in the Port Phillip District of the then Australian colony of New South Wales (now Victoria). From 1848 another force was organised in New South Wales, which operated mostly within the borders of the later colony of Queensland. This force, sometimes called the \\"Native Mounted Police Force\\", was the largest and longest lasting of the mainland forces, and is best known for conducting widespread extrajudicial shootings of Aboriginal people under the official euphemism of \\"dispersal\\". It existed from 1848 to about 1915, when the last Native Police camps in Queensland were closed.Isabel Ellender and Peter Christiansen, pp 87–90 People of the Merri Merri.

Black, Edward Street, December 1880, 57 pages; Richards, Jonathan: The Secret War. A True History of Queensland's Native Police, St Lucia Queensland 2008, 308 pages incl. ill. and appendixes. The method of \\"dispersal\\" against Aboriginal people was also employed by the Native Police of other colonies and also by groups such as pastoral station workers, the colonial British Army and the Border Police. The government of South Australia set up a short-lived Native Police force in 1852, which was re-established in 1884 and deployed into what is now the Northern Territory. The colonial Western Australian government also initiated a formal Native Police force in 1840 under the command of John Nicol Drummond. Other privately funded native police systems were also occasionally used in Australia, such as the native constabulary organised by the Australian Agricultural Company in the 1830s. Native Police forces were also officially implemented in the Papua and New Guinea territories administered by colonial Queensland and Australian governments from 1890 until the 1970s. The Australian government also organised a native police force on Nauru during its administration of the island from 1923 until 1968. Early prototypes of native police The general template for native police forces in Australia was the sepoy and sowar armies of the East India Company. However, the more compact forces of the British imperial frontier like the Cape Regiment in southern Africa and the Kaffir and Malay Corps in Ceylon are a closer comparison. Before the creation of the first official Native Police forces, there were some informal and privately funded examples of utilising Aboriginal men as enforcers of colonial British rule in Australia. Hawkesbury/Nepean The frequently violent process of taking control of the land from the Aboriginal people in this area was officially left to the settlers themselves, who were reinforced, at times of major conflict, with soldiers \\"to inflict exemplary and severe punishments\\".. Coercing and influencing \\"friendly\\" Aboriginal people into assisting with the capture or elimination of other \\"hostile natives\\" was quickly adopted as a method of improving the efficiency of these punitive missions. In 1805, Hawkesbury chief constable Andrew Thompson exploited intra-clan rivalries by equipping two Darug men with firearms to aid in the destruction of another group of Darug. Seven or eight \\"hostile natives\\" were killed as a result and the two mercenaries were each promised a wife from the women seized during the raid. Armed Aboriginal men were also used to capture runaway convicts in the region and John Macarthur sometimes appeared at public functions with a bodyguard of uniformed Dharawal and Gandangara men. Bathurst In 1824, at the conclusion of the Bathurst War against the Wiradjuri, Governor Brisbane sent Major James Thomas Morisset, commandant of the British forces at Bathurst, a letter congratulating him on his efforts. In this letter, Brisbane outlines his desire to give \\"rewards to the natives who assisted in the police\\" and advised Morisset that he had \\"directed £50 subject to detailed accounts of its expenditure\\" to be at his disposal. Van Diemen's Land Musquito was a Hawkesbury Aboriginal man who was exiled first to Norfolk Island in 1805, then to Van Diemen's Land in 1813. He proved to be a valuable asset to the government there in tracking down bushrangers. He later became a renegade and was himself tracked down and shot in the groin by another Hawkesbury aboriginal named Teague. Teague was sent by Hawkesbury settler Edward Luttrell to capture Musquito on the promise of a whaleboat as payment. Teague never received the boat and Musquito was hanged in 1825. In the 1830s, John Batman also used armed Aboriginal men from the Sydney region such as Pigeon and Tommy to assist in his roving parties to capture or kill indigenous Tasmanians. Newcastle/Port Stephens Up until at least 1830s, Aboriginal men around the Newcastle and Port Macquarie penal settlements were regularly utilised to recapture escaped convicts. Men such as Biraban and Jemmy Jackass would track down the runaways, disable them with spears, strip them and return them to the soldiers for payment of blankets and corn. At nearby Port Stephens, the Australian Agricultural Company had obtained a million acre land acquisition. In the early 1830s, the superintendent of the company, Sir Edward Parry, established a private native constabulary to augment a small garrison of soldiers. In one instance, these black constables, such as Jonathan and William, were tasked to search for three Aboriginal people who had murdered a man named Hogue and runaways. Parry was later officially accused of offering rewards on the heads of certain aboriginal people, to which he stated that 'unequivocally to declare that I never, directly or indirectly, offered any such Reward'. By 1841, the new superintendent P.P. King still employed black constables, but their duties may have been limited to dingo culling. Goulburn Also in the 1830s, Major Edmund Lockyer a magistrate in the Goulburn region, employed at least one Aboriginal constable who captured murderers and gangs of armed bushrangers in the region. Port Phillip District and surrounds (later known as Victoria) In the late 1830s, the NSW government found it was having trouble financing the NSW Mounted Police which was a corps of mounted soldiers that since 1825 operated as the main enforcers of colonial rule in frontier areas. Officials looked at cheaper alternatives and came up with two solutions. One was the Border Police, which was a mounted force of armed convicts under the command of a commissioner, and the other was to trial a force of armed and mounted Aboriginal police under the command of white officers. By 1840 the Border Police became the main replacement for the NSW Mounted Police along the frontier, while the Native Police Corps, as the Aboriginal force was known, was limited initially to one division in the Port Phillip District of the colony, around Melbourne. Requests for the establishment of a Native Police Corps were made from as early as 1837 when Captain William Lonsdale proposed legislation for its formation. Establishment In October 1837, Christian Ludolph Johannes de Villiers was appointed to command the first official Native Police troopers from their station at Nerre Nerre Warren. It was disbanded briefly in January 1838 but reorganised in April of the same year with their new headquarters in Jolimont where the MCG carpark is now situated. Due to funding problems, the force was again dissolved in 1839. These issues delayed reformation of the corps until Superintendent Charles La Trobe indicated he was willing to underwrite the costs in 1842. A significant factor in the restoration of the force was the successful capture of five Tasmanian aboriginal people near Westernport in 1840 by local Aboriginal men who were attached to a party of Border Police and soldiers. Native Police of Port Phillip, 1850 Henry EP Dana was selected to command the corps in 1842. Except for a brief period where the corps was based at Merri Creek, the headquarters was at the Aboriginal Protectorate Station at Nerre Nerre Warren, near to present day Dandenong about south-east of Melbourne. The force made use of Aboriginal men from the Wurundjeri and Bunurong tribes and was made up of 60 members, three-quarters of whom were \\"natives\\".Public Records Office Victoria, Dana's Native Police Corps (1842–1853) – Tracking the Native Police (Public Record Office Victoria) , accessed 2 November 2008 There were two goals in such a force: to make use of the indigenous peoples' tracking abilities, as well as to assimilate the Aboriginal troopers into white society. Both La Trobe and William Thomas, Protector of Aborigines, expected that the men would give up their traditional way of life when exposed to the discipline of police work. To their disappointment, troopers continued to participate in corroborees and in ritual fighting, although not in uniform. As senior Wurundjeri elder, Billibellary's cooperation for the proposal was important for its success, and after deliberation he backed the initiative and even proposed himself for enlistment. He donned the uniform and enjoyed the status of parading through the camp, but was careful to avoid active duty as a policeman to avoid a conflict of interest between his duties as a Wurundjeri ngurungaeta. After about a year Billibellary resigned from the Native Police Corps when he found that it was to be used to capture and kill other natives. He did his best from then on to undermine the corps and as a result many native troopers deserted and few remained longer than three or four years.Shirley W. Wiencke, When the Wattles Bloom Again: The Life and Times of William Barak, Last Chief of the Yarra Yarra Tribe, Published by S.W. Wiencke, 1984, , Duties The main duty of the Native Police was to be deployed to areas around the Port Phillip region where Aboriginal resistance to British occupation was unable to be controlled by armed settlers. Once in these areas, the troopers and their officers were placed under the command of the local Commissioner for Crown Lands, who would then seek out and capture or destroy the dissident groups and individuals. In addition to Native Police, the Commissioner also had the troopers of the Border Police and NSW Mounted Police as well as armed volunteer settlers at his disposal to conduct punitive raids on Aboriginal people. Other more minor duties of the native police included searching for missing persons, carrying messages, and escorting dignitaries through unfamiliar territory. During the goldrush era, they were also used to patrol goldfields and search for escaped prisoners.Public Records Office Victoria, Large Variety of Duties of the Native Police – Tracking the Native Police (Public Record Office Victoria) , accessed 2 November 2008 They were provided with uniforms, firearms, food rations and a rather dubious salary. However, the lure of the goldfields, poor salary and Dana's eventual death in 1852 led to the official disintegration of his Native Police Corps in January 1853.Public Records Office Victoria, The disbanding of the Native Police – Tracking the Native Police (Public Record Office Victoria) Accessed 2 November 2008 During its existence, there were three main areas of activity of this corps: Portland Bay, Murray River, and Gippsland. Divisions of the Native Police would be deployed to these areas in the winter of each year until 1852 and spend the rest of the year mostly garrisoned at the Narre Narre Warren barracks. Winter was chosen as the period of active duty as the target Aboriginal people were more sedentary in the colder periods and therefore much easier to find. Frontier clashesPortland Bay-Western District= Native police were called upon to take part in massacres of other Aboriginal people in the Victorian Western District in 1843. Operations in this year included attacks upon the Gunditjmara and Jardwadjali at the Crawford River, Mt Eckersley, Victoria Range and at Mt Zero. Upon return to Melbourne one of the troopers boasted about an incident in which 17 Aboriginal men had been killed by the corps. From reports it seems likely the troopers were called upon by their commander, Henry EP Dana, to shoot rather than try to make arrests: : \\"Captain say big one stupid catch them very good shoot them, you blackfellows, no shoot them me hand cuff you and send you to jail.\\" One of the troopers is recorded by Thomas to have said.Public Records Office Victoria, Western District Clashes – Tracking the Native Police (Public Record Office Victoria) . Accessed 2 November 2008 With reduced reports of attacks in the Western District following two years of policing, two new troopers were signed up from the Port Fairy area in 1845.Public Records Office Victoria, Western District Clashes Imposing Peace – Tracking the Native Police (Public Record Office Victoria) . Accessed 2 November 2008 Although 1843 appears to be the year of the largest casualties from the corps in this region, operations in other years up to 1847 resulted in further mass fatalities namely at Lake Learmonth, Cape Otway, the Eumeralla area and at Captain Firebrace's Mt Vectis property. The Native Police based at Portland Bay were ordered to conduct operations across the border at Mount Gambier in South Australia in 1844. Likewise, South Australian police forces at the same time were used to investigate the rape of an aboriginal boy named Syntax near Portland. The officer involved found that the boy was shot by Native Police. =Murray Region= The Native Police deployed to this region operated over a large area that included forays across the Murray into the Tumut region right down to the Wimmera. They worked under their own officers such as Cowan, Walsh and Dana while also under the authority of Commissioners like Smythe, Bingham, Powlett and McDonald. In 1843 and 1844, Commissioner Smythe led large punitive missions with forces including Native Police along the Moira area of the Murray, down Mitta Mitta creek and along the Edward River. Other collisions also occurred near Tongala. Further down the Murray, punitive operations were also conducted near McLeod's station in 1846, Lake Bael Bael in 1846 and around Swan Hill in 1850. Swan Hill and Echuca (Maidan's Punt) became bases for Native Police operations. A Wemba Wemba man managed to kill a trooper near Swan Hill. He, in the company of another aboriginal man, approached a Native Police camp and induced one of the Aboriginal troopers to go fishing. After walking about half a mile, they held the trooper down and excised his kidney fat, leaving him to die. =Gippsland= Native Police operations in Gippsland began in 1843 with the appointment of Commissioner Tyers to the region. Tyers had command of a permanent force of Border Police based at Eagle Point augmented with a seasonal deployment of native police based at Boisdale. The closeness of the Border Police and the Native Police is demonstrated by officer Windredge who was employed in both forces in Gippsland. In 1845 and 1846, Tyers led extensive punitive raids with his forces around Lake Wellington, up the Avon River and down to the Lakes region. In late 1846 and early 1847, in a horrible example of British colonial values, a rumour began that a shipwrecked white woman had been abducted by a Gunai clan. Outraged Victorian sensibility demanded both the rescue of the supposed damsel and the wholesale punishment of the natives involved. A special Native Police mission was organised in September 1846 under HEP Dana that failed to produce the white woman. A private posse of ten armed Aboriginal men and six whites was then organised under de Villiers which also did not produce the woman. The rumour of the white woman was proved false, but the results for the Gunai were devastating. Tyers estimated that the two punitive groups killed at least 50 Aboriginal people and wounded many more. At the same time, more regular combined Native and Border Police operations resulted in mass killings of Gunai around Boisdale and on the MacAllister River. There was a large punitive operation in late 1846 at the mouth of the Snowy River involving the forces being split into 3 groups to surround and engage Aboriginal people residing in the estuary area. The Native Police Corps then continued upstream along the river.Public Records Office Victoria, Gippsland Clashes – Tracking the Native Police (Public Record Office Victoria) . Accessed 2 November 2008 The brutality of these Gippsland Aboriginal men is demonstrated by the Protector Thomas being able to describe how they killed one man, two women and six children, returning with fragments of their flesh to eat, or returning with the mummified severed hands of the defeated as trophies. Western Australia In the late 1830s, Western Australia was in a similar situation as the eastern colonies in that the regular Mounted Police force were proving expensive and increasingly ineffectual in subduing resisting Aboriginal people. This culminated in 1840 with the murders of a white woman and her child in York. John Nicol Drummond, a young man who had grown up amongst Aboriginal people in the areas of the Swan and Helena Valleys, was able to capture the perpetrator due to his knowledge of the local tribespeople. As a result, in August 1840 Drummond was rewarded with the title of Inspector in the newly formed Native Police. The Western Australian Native Police was smaller than those of other colonies in that usually only 2 or 3 mounted aboriginal constables were attached to the white officer. It was also different in that the officers were given monetary rewards for capturing wanted people and that they were placed under the control of the Native Protector. However, extrajudicial killings by the police upon Aboriginal people still occurred during the 1840s. The force also became less formalised in its command structure to the point where, in 1854, Drummond concurrently held the positions of Native Protector, magistrate and Superintendent of Police in the Champion Bay area. This situation gave Drummond complete freedom to subdue the natives around Geraldton in whatever method he deemed appropriate and a massacre of Aboriginal people conducted by the police and armed stockholders at Bootenal swamp near Greenough was the result. The official term Native Police in the colony soon gradually phased out and was replaced with terms such as native constables and native assistants, but these operated in the same way as before. In 1865, Maitland Brown's extensive punitive expedition through the La Grange and Roebuck Bay areas utilised native police to aid in the summary executions of local Aboriginal people. As late as the 1920s, native constables or trackers as they by then were called, aided white officers and stockmen in massacres of Aboriginal people. A famous example of this is the Forrest River massacre. New South Wales and Queensland From 1839 the main frontier policing force in this colony were divisions of mounted convict soldiers known as the Border Police. However, in the late 1840s with the end of convict transportation looming, a new source of cheap and effective troopers were required to subdue resistance along the ever-extending frontier. The need was especially apparent in the north as conflict between squatters and Aboriginal people toward the Darling Downs area was slowing pastoral expansion. As a result, the NSW government passed legislation in 1848 to fund a new section of Native Police based upon the Port Phillip model. Frederick Walker, a station manager and court official residing in the Murrumbidgee area, was appointed as the first Commandant of this Native Police force. Walker recruited 14 native troopers from four different language groups along the Murrumbidgee, Murray, and Edwards Rivers areas. These first troopers were Jack, Henry (both Wiradjuri), Geegwaw, Jacky Jacky, Wygatta, Edward, Logan (all Wemba-Wemba), Alladin, Paddy, Larry, Willy, Walter, Tommy Hindmarsh (all Barapa Barapa), and Yorky (Yorta Yorta). Logan and Jack who were both previously employed in the Border Police, were given the rank of corporal. Although most of the subsequent operations of this force over the following 60 years occurred in what is now Queensland, Native Police were stationed in various parts of New South Wales and patrolling continued there until at least 1868. These areas included Kempsey/Macleay River, Grafton/Ballina (Clarence River), Murrumbidgee, Lower Darling/Albert and Upper Darling/Paroo regions. Initial deployment Frederick Walker This force was consolidated and trained by Walker at Deniliquin before traveling to the Darling River where the first Aboriginal attack occurred 100 miles below Fort Bourke at a place called Moanna, resulting in at least 5 natives being killed by the troopers. In 1849 he mobilised his force north beyond the MacIntyre River to conduct missions to police the out-stations. Once arriving on the Macintyre River on 10 May 1849, the force checked the aggressions of the local Aboriginal people, and when trying to capture six Aboriginal men charged with murder, there were \\"some lives lost\\". They were then deployed to the Condamine River where the \\"Fitzroy Downs blacks\\" were routed and another group were \\"compelled to fly\\" from the area. One of these skirmishes was described as a dawn raid on an Aboriginal encampment where around 100 native people were killed and two Native Police troopers were fatally injured. Walker found most of the squatters in the region thought the Native Police existed to shoot down the natives so they would not have to. Walker advocated a method of \\"bringing in\\" the Aboriginal people, allowing them onto pastoral stations, where they could obtain a lawful means of a livelihood. Those who stayed away were consequently regarded as potential enemies and were at high risk of being targeted in punitive missions. Walker's measure of success was the resulting increase in land values. These first actions of the Native Police reduced to great effect Aboriginal resistance against squatters in the Macintyre and Condamine regions.L. E. Skinner, pp28-33 Police of the Pastoral Frontier. Native Police 1849–59, University of Queensland Press, 1975 Expansion to Maranoa, Burnett, Dawson and Wide Bay areas Walker returned to Deniliquin in July 1850 to recruit 30 new troopers in order to enable an expansion into the Wide Bay–Burnett region. With these fresh reinforcements, he created four divisions of Native Police, one based at Augustus Morris' Callandoon station, one at Wide Bay–Burnett, one in the Maranoa Region, and one roving division. While Walker was away, the squatter at Goondiwindi station, Richard Purvis Marshall, assumed command of the Native Police operations. Marshall, with the native troopers and contingents of armed stockmen, conducted punitive raids at Tieryboo, Wallan, Booranga and Copranoranbilla Lagoon, shooting Aboriginal people and destroying their camps. This resulted in an inquiry by the local Crown Lands Commissioner and a vaguely worded official reminder from the NSW Attorney General to only shoot in \\"extreme cases\\". In 1851, Commandant Walker with his newly appointed officers Richard Purvis Marshall, George Fulford, Doolan and Skelton conducted wide-ranging and frequent operations resulting in many dispersals and summary killings. Dispersals of large numbers of Aborigines occurred at Dalgangal, Mary River, Toomcul, Goondiwindi and at various places along the Maranoa River. Governor Fitzroy noted in the 1851 end of year report that a great many blacks were killed, however no official action was taken to change the aggressive functioning of the Native Police. Fraser Island On 18 February 1851, a meeting of magistrates was held at the newly established town of Maryborough. Three Native Police officers, Commissioner Bidwill and squatter Edmund B. Uhr were present, issuing warrants against a number of Aboriginal men accused of murder and felony. The nearby Fraser Island was being used as a sanctuary for these Aboriginal people (the Badtjala people). It was not until late December 1851 that the force was ready to search Fraser Island. Walker, Marshall, Doolan with their three divisions of troopers, together with local landholders the Leith Hay brothers and Mr Wilmot set out down the Mary River aboard Captain Currie's Margaret and Mary schooner. Aboriginal people in a stolen dinghy were shot at along the way and the boat seized. The force landed on the west coast of the island where the divisions split up to scour the region. During the night a group of Aboriginal men attempted to surprise Marshall's section resulting in two Aboriginal men being shot. Bad weather hampered operations and Commandant Walker subsequently allowed his division to track down other groups of Badtjala without him. This group followed the local Aboriginal people across to the east coast where they \\"took to the sea\\". The force returned to Maryborough in early January 1852 and Captain Currie received a reward of £10 for his contribution. Consolidation of the Native Police John Murray The year 1852 saw further recruitment and expansion of the Native Police to 8 divisions. Forty-eight new troopers were signed up mostly from the northern inland rivers of NSW. Lieutenant John Murray was appointed to the 4th Division, Lieut. Blandford to the 3rd Division and Sergeants Skelton, Pincolt and Richard A. Dempster were also appointed as officers in charge of other divisions. The Traylan barracks on the Burnett River near the now-abandoned site of Ceratodus, north of present-day Eidsvold, was established while the other major barracks, besides Callandoon, was at Wondai Gumbal near Yuleba. Sgt. Dempster was responsible for several large scale dispersals in 1852. The first was at Wallumbilla where an ex-trooper named Priam and a number of others were shot dead. Dempster then traveled to Ogilvie's Wachoo station near St. George and shot a large number of Aboriginal people with the aid of a man named Johnson who was the superintendent of the property. Johnson also shot dead a white storeperson in a \\"friendly fire\\" incident during this dispersal. Dempster, having fallen sick, then allowed Johnson to take charge of his division and lead it to Yamboukal (modern-day Surat) where a lot of Mandandanji working peacefully on this pastoral station were subsequently killed. As a result of this, Dempster was suspended for 3 months. It appears that neither Johnson nor Dempster faced any legal repercussions. Sgt. Skelton also led a number of dispersals across the Dawson River area and down to Ukabulla (also near Surat) where Mandandanji leader Bussamarai was killed. Collisions also occurred between John Murray's troopers and Kabi Kabi at Widgee and with Walker's forces and the Bigambul south of Callandoon. Native Police were also employed tracking down Chinese coolie labourers who had run away from the stations of powerful squatter capitalists such as Gordon Sandeman. Deployment to Port Curtis In 1853 several new Sub-Lieutenants were appointed including John O'Connell Bligh, Edric Norfolk Vaux Morisset, Frederick Keen, Samuel Crummer, Francis Nicoll and Frederick Walker's brother Robert G. Walker. The Sydney Morning Herald described the operations of Lieutenants Marshall and John Murray along the Burnett River as \\"taking and shooting hosts of murderers, never stopping, never tiring\\". New barracks were built at Rannes, Walla and at Swanson's Yabba station at the top of Yabba Falls. Squatters Holt and Hay pursued an overland path to the taking up of lands toward Port Curtis. Two men accompanying them were killed by Aboriginal people and as a consequence, the 1st Division of Native Police under Commandant Walker was sent into the area. Additionally, Lieutenant John Murray and the 3rd Division with the troopers of Sgt. Doolan were deployed by ship to Gladstone to ensure a strong garrison at the fledgling settlement there. The surveyor sent to mark out Gladstone, Francis MacCabe, felt so unsafe that he established the camp in an area close to the coast, two miles away from any freshwater. Murrumbidgee As Walker's force originated in this area, native troopers from outside this region were utilised to punish Aboriginal resistance in the Murrumbidgee. For instance, in 1852, after the murder of an American worker at Deniliquin, Sergeant O'Halloran from Moulamein imported both native and white troopers from Victoria to shoot Aboriginal people as a collective punishment. His force drove a camp of people, most of them older women and children, across the Edward River, fatally wounding 2 women and a child. By 1853, 12 troopers of Native Police were officially stationed in the Murrumbidgee District under the command of the local Commissioner for Crown Lands. The need for native troopers in this region was soon deemed superfluous and the government dissolved this detachment in 1857. However, the Murrumbidgee was still utilised as a recruitment area for troopers to fight in Queensland with Lieut. John Murray returning to the area as late as 1865 to enlist local Aboriginal men. In 1864, Murray visited the region bringing with him the remaining four living troopers from Walker's first recruitment in 1848. After 15 years service, one of them was lucky enough to be reunited with his father in Echuca. Grafton/Ballina Edric Norfolk Vaux Morisset In 1853, Walker reluctantly deployed the 5th Section of the Native Police under 2nd Lieut. Edric Norfolk Vaux Morisset to the Clarence River region. He thought this was a \\"retrograde step\\" as he viewed the Aboriginal problem is this area as minor. But under pressure from powerful squatters in the area like William Forster he relented even though the section did not have enough horses. Morisset and his 12 troopers were stationed on the Orara River at Braunstone 10 miles south of Grafton and were involved in two major dispersals not long after. Morisset was given warrants for the arrest of some Aboriginal people who worked as shearers at Newton Boyd and after arriving in the area on a borrowed horse, ordered his troops to open fire. Several wanted men were shot and some captured, although other reports claim many Aboriginal people were killed. This resulted in a government inquiry but no real changes being made. The other significant punitive raid occurred in East Ballina, where the troopers conducted an early morning raid on Aboriginal people sleeping on the slopes near Black Head. This resulted in at least 30-40 deaths and many wounded. Again complaints were made to the government about the massacre but again no changes resulted. Edric Morisset later became Commandant of the Native Police based in Brisbane and was replaced on the Clarence by 2nd Lieut. John O'Connell Bligh. A few years later when a Clarence River squatter was asked if he thought any Aboriginal criminals were still at large, he simply replied \\"No, I think they are dead.\\" The Native Police were officially withdrawn from the area in 1859. Sub-Inspector Galbraith was dismissed in 1863 for the accidental shooting death of a native girl while out \\"routing the blacks\\" near Grafton. Kempsey/Macleay River Native Police trooper In 1854, Sub Lieut. Dempster who was initially stationed as a sergeant at Grafton with Morisset was ordered to travel to the Macleay River with six troopers and set up a Native Police station near Kempsey. Squatters in the area had recently placed official requests for a section to be garrisoned on the Macleay. The Native Police camp was located at the old Border Police barracks at Belgrave Flat near Belgrave Falls just west of Kempsey. In 1859, 2nd Lieut. Richard Bedford Poulden (sometimes written as Poulding) was deployed to Belgrave Flat with his troopers from the Upper Dawson area in Queensland. Poulden was previously an Ensign in 56th Foot who fought in the Crimean War, and was the great-grandson of the Earl of Devon. In addition to performing patrolling duties, he also came for the purpose of recruiting more troopers. In 1859 he conducted a raid on Aboriginal people living at Christmas Creek near Frederickton. He captured a Dunghutti man called Doughboy who had murdered a sawyer named Dan Page. In 1860, Poulden was soon called out again to capture Aboriginal criminals who had laid siege to Mrs McMaugh at Nulla Nulla Creek. Poulden and his six troopers tracked them up Five Day Creek to the ranges where several were killed after a gunfight. An orphaned child was taken after the skirmish and delivered to local Towal Creek squatter John Warne to look after. The native police involved in such raids used to strip naked and would wear red headbands to distinguish them from the \\"wild blacks\\", so as to prevent shooting each other by mistake. Not long after this, at the request of prominent station manager John Vaughan McMaugh, the Belgrave Flat Native Police barracks was moved to Nulla Nulla station near Bellbrook. After some cedar cutters were hacked to death and others had their skulls smashed in during an ambush, stockmen and native police troopers went out after the murderers. Again another battle ensued and in the end there were a great number of dead and wounded Dunghutti. The creek where this occurred was named Waterloo Creek (halfway between Dyke River and Georges Creek) as a result of the carnage. Four prisoners were taken. In 1863, Senior Constable Nugent took control of the Native Police at Nulla Nulla. In September 1864, he and his troopers were involved in a mission that ranged from Georges Creek, Lagoon Creek and then up Five Day Creek to Moy Buck Mountain. When the Aboriginal camp was discovered the Aboriginal fled in all directions. Later in 1864, there is a record of the murderer named Blue Shirt being captured and handcuffed to the stirrup of a horse belonging to a Native Police trooper. The horse subsequently become frightened and kicked him to death. Names of some of the troopers posted to the Macleay region include Carlo, Quilt, Paddy and Dundally. Nulla Nulla barracks appears to have closed in 1865 when Henry Sauer bought the property and turned it into a dairy farm. In 1885, 36.4 hectares of the property was gazetted as an Aboriginal Reserve. In 1902 the skeletons of a woman and child with shot holes in their skulls were found on Taylors Arm Mountain in the Macleay region. It was reported as a double murder mystery. Local Aboriginal Left-Handed Billy solved the case by stating that there was a Native Police camp at Nulla Nulla and these two people were some of its victims. Billy offered to take the authorities and show them the other places where people were shot. Lower Darling and Albert Districts These districts appear to have overlapped in their geographical jurisdictions, but they were treated for the most part as separate areas. The Lower Darling extended from the confluence of the Murrumbidgee with the Murray, up to the Darling and north to Fort Bourke. The Albert region was the area west of the Darling River. In late 1853, Stephen Cole, the Commissioner for Crown Lands for the Lower Darling district had organised six troopers for his Native Police based in Euston. This force was involved in arresting European sly-grog sellers. At the same time, Commissioner for Crown Lands for the Albert District, G.M. Perry, had organised another six Native Police troopers based at Moorana, an administrative town that used to exist just west of Wentworth. By the late 1850s the jurisdiction of the native troopers had transferred from the Crown Lands department to the Native Police proper, with E.M. Lockyer and A. T. Perry being appointed 2nd Lieutenants for the Lower Darling and Albert districts respectively. Perry and his troopers, while investigating the death of a white man at Baker's station, threatened and watched four Aboriginal people residing on the property into making confessions. While they were being escorted to prison, they escaped, and after refusing to surrender, one was shot dead. The other three managed to escape but were found at Euston where two more were shot dead. Their hands were cut off and presented as proof of their demise. Perry also dispersed a large congregation of Aboriginal people assembled at the Murray-Darling junction. When investigating another murder of a white man near Menindie, Perry had the ring leader tied to a tree and shot dead as an example in \\"keeping the blacks quiet\\". It appears that the Native Police units were dissolved in the Lower Darling and Albert Districts by the early 1860s. Upper Darling and Paroo Lieutenant Perry occasionally sent several native troopers into the Upper Darling areas to accompany official expeditions into the area. A police station was established at Tintinalogy between Menindee and Wilcannia. As late as 1868, Native Police based at Thargomindah in Queensland conducted patrols down the Paroo River as far as Fort Bourke in New South Wales. Sub-Inspector W.R.O. Hill described one of these patrols. Hill saw one of Aboriginal troopers named Vick carrying a four- year-old son of an aboriginal man who \\"had been deservedly shot\\". The boy spat in the eye of the trooper who then killed the boy by smashing his head into a tree. Although Hill flogged the trooper as punishment, as Hill stated, it showed \\"the savage instinct will come out in the aboriginal.\\" Dismissal of Frederick Walker The size of the Native Police expanded further in 1854 to 10 Divisions. Commandant Walker was suspended from duty in September and the inquiry, to be held in Brisbane, was set for December. The inquiry was closed to the public and the report was kept secret for two years and even then only fragments of information were released. It revealed that Walker arrived at the inquiry completely drunk and surrounded by nine of his black troopers. The troopers were denied entry, and after an attempt to continue with proceedings, the inebriation of Walker forced an adjournment to the inquiry which was later quickly and conveniently abandoned altogether. An attempt by 2nd Lieut. Irving to confront Walker, resulted in the ex-Commandant drawing a sword against him. Eventually, Walker wandered off and was subsequently dismissed from the Native Police. He was later apprehended at Bromelton, charged with the embezzlement of £100 and sent to Sydney. Period of decline, Expansion to the Fitzroy River area After the dismissal of Frederick Walker, the force entered a period of poor funding and uncertainty. Many troopers either deserted or were discharged. Richard Purvis Marshall was promoted to Commandant but was soon discharged from the position after complaining of the trooper reductions. With the force in a weakened state, aboriginal resistance became more bold. In September 1855, in retaliation against two previous dispersals and for the stealing of women, Gangulu warriors attacked the Native Police barracks at Rannes, killing three troopers of R. G. Walker's division. Mt. Larcom station was also attacked around this time, resulting in the deaths of five station- hands. Multiple punitive missions were conducted by John Murray and R. G. Walker's sections after these attacks, including one which went north of the Fitzroy River. Charles Archer of Gracemere provided assistance with this dispersal by attaching his own private native troopers to the corps. This augmented party killed 14 Aboriginal people. In revenge, these Aboriginal people then attacked Elliot's new pastoral run at Nine Mile on the Fitzroy River, killing one person and wounding three including Elliot. Charles Archer had arrived in Gracemere in August 1855 with an escort of 35 people including four Native Police troopers and four \\"Burnett boys\\". Once arrived, he obtained the protective services of a local Fitzroy River clan led by \\"King Harold\\" which Archer utilised to \\"restrain the outside blacks\\". In July 1856, Richard E. Palmer travelled to the Fitzroy River from Gladstone, escorted by sub- Lieutenant W.D.T. Powell and his troopers, to set up the first store at Rockhampton. Powell went first to this area and constructed a Native Police barracks. This was the first habitable dwelling erected by the British in Rockhampton. It was on the south side of the river at the end of Albert Street. With increased attacks around this time and reports of discharged troopers conducting armed robberies around the region, squatters began to call for an immediate re-strengthening of the Native Police. A select committee inquiry into improving the Native Police was implemented and in late 1856 the control of the Native Police was transferred from the Inspector General of Police in Sydney to John Clements Wickham who was the Government Resident in Brisbane. New officers such as Moorhead, Thomas Ross, Walter David Taylor Powell, Francis Allman, Evan Williams, Frederick Carr and Charles Phibbs were appointed. In May 1857, the vacant position of Commandant was filled by E.N.V. Morisset and the headquarters of the Native Police was shifted from Traylan to Cooper's Plains just west of Maryborough. However, even with this reorganisation, strong indigenous resistance continued. Attacks at Miriam Vale, Eurombah and Hornet Bank After an aboriginal ambush at Miriam Vale near Gladstone, it was determined that Curtis Island (like Fraser Island previously) was a safehaven for natives that should be breached. 2nd Lieutenant R. G. Walker organised a seaborne punitive expedition that included several troopers, 2nd Lieut. W. D. T. Powell and local squatters J. Landsborough and Ranken. The mission was a failure and despite shooting two Aboriginal people in a canoe, Curtis Island was deemed dangerously populated. On the Dawson River at Eurombah station 2nd Lieut. Ross with local squatter Boulton carried out several punitive missions killing at least 10 Aboriginal people. Trooper desertions continued to be a problem in this area and containment of aboriginal resistance was problematic. A large attack on Eurombah station resulted in the deaths of six station workers. Officers Ross, Powell and E.N.V. Morisset led subsequent deadly punitive raids. Ross was suspended due to neglect of duty for allowing the Eurombah attack to occur. Native Police dispersal Not long after, on 27 October 1857, a combined Aboriginal offensive on neighbouring Hornet Bank station resulted in the death of eleven settlers. This was, at the time, the largest loss of British life in conflict on the Australian frontier and with the concurrent Indian Mutiny threatening the basis of British global colonisation, the military response was predictably merciless. Officer W. D. T. Powell was the first Native Police officer to arrive and immediately tracked down and killed at least eight Aboriginal people. Multiple punitive missions conducted in the subsequent months under Powell, Carr and Moorhead killed at least 70 Aboriginal people. These shootings were blantantly indiscriminate with W. D. T. Powell reporting shooting down three unarmed Aboriginal women while they were running away. In addition to the official government Native Police response, there were at least three other private militias formed in the Dawson River area to conduct wholesale killings of Aboriginal people. The first was the private native police formed by ex-commandant Frederick Walker. This group consisted of ten ex-Native Police troopers which conducted missions as far south as Surat. The second was the so-called \\"Browne's\\" death squad that consisted of a posse of twelve local squatters which killed around 90 Aboriginal people. The last was the group associated with William Fraser, who had most of his family killed in the Hornet Bank massacre. This group killed around 40 Aboriginal people, some of which were buried beside a lagoon on Juandah creek. After Hornet Bank right Another government inquiry in Sydney was ordered in July 1858 which concluded with the recommendation that \\"there is no alternative but to carry matters through with a strong hand and punish with necessary severity all future outrages\\". New officers were appointed including Frederick Wheeler and George Poultney Malcolm Murray and in August, Commandant Edric Morisset organised a large combined force of 17 troopers under Phibbs, Carr and G.P.M. Murray with a month's rations to scour the Upper Dawson area. The explorer A. C. Gregory accompanied this force and partook in their actions. Officers Bligh and Moorhead at the same time patrolled the stations adjoining the scrubs in the region. Gwambegwine and Kinnoul near Taroom became barracks for the Native Police. Ex-Commandant Walker wrote several letters to the Attorney General admonishing the murders of innocent Aboriginal people including that of Tommy Hippi, Tahiti and the massacre of Aboriginal people at a Juandah courthouse after they were found not guilty of crime. Formation of the colony of Queensland Queensland separated from New South Wales and became a self- governing British colony in December 1859. E.N.V. Morisset, in addition to retaining his role as Commandant of the Native Police, also became the Inspector General of Police in the new colony. The Native Police had even less checks and balances than it did previously in this new administration. Morisset appointed new officers such as A.M.G. Patrick, A.F. Matveieff, J.T. Baker as well as his own brother Rudolph S. Morisset. The Native Police Force that operated in Queensland was the longest operating force of its kind in colonial Australian history. It was arguably also the most controversial. Its mode of operation cannot by any standard be classified as \\"law enforcement\\". From the period 1859 onward to the 1890s there are no signs that this force was engaged in anything but general punitive expeditions, commonly performed as deadly daybreak attacks on Aboriginal camps. All signs are that the force generally took no prisoners at the frontier and in the few cases on record when this did happen these prisoners were on record as having been shot during attempts to escape.The Way We Civilize editorials and articles authored and edited by Carl Feilberg and printed in the Brisbane Courier (and its weekly The Queenslander) between March and December 1880 and in the form of a pamphlet. see also L. E. Skinner, pp27 Police of the Pastoral Frontier.

John O'Connell Bligh In 1860 near Yuleba, a two-hour stand up battle between Lieutenant Carr's Native Police and the \\"Dawson blacks\\" led by Baulie (also known as Bilbah) resulted in Carr being wounded and Baulie and fifteen other Yiman being shot dead. A traveler at the time described how some Aboriginal \\"refugees\\" of these upper Dawson River conflicts had encamped at Euthulla. Their wailing for their dead kept him awake at night and many had gunshot wounds, some being crippled by their injuries. In 1860, a number of settlers sent letters requesting Lieutenant Wheeler's aid in the Broadsound region, which was suffering from Aboriginal raids. On 24 December 1860, Lieutenant Wheeler and six of his Aboriginal troopers went to John Hardies' out station located at Fassifern and shot dead three Aboriginal males. The subsequent newspaper coverage pushed the Queensland Government into organising an inquiry into the Native Police. In evidence given at the 1861 Select Committee report on the Native Police, Lieutenant Carr gave many other examples of shootings of Aboriginal people in the area. Likewise, in the still unconquered Pine Rivers region just north of Brisbane, Lieut. Williams' patrol was attacked by around 300 Ningi Ningi warriors. Many of them were shot but of the eight troopers with Williams, one was killed and two were seriously wounded. Seven \\"station blacks\\" were shot dead at Couyar by Native Police, Lieut. Wheeler shot several innocent Aboriginal people at Dugandan, Lieut. John Murray conducted a massacre in the Wide Bay area and officers John O'Connell Bligh and Rudolph Morisset indiscriminately shot \\"station blacks\\" on properties around the Conondale Range. In a separate incident, Bligh also chased and shot dead some Aboriginal people along the main street of Maryborough and into the river in broad daylight. Bligh received a special ceremony and a commemorative sword from the citizens of that town for his exploits. The Cullin-la-ringo massacre and its aftermath The violence of the early 1860s culminated in the Cullin-la-ringo massacre which occurred on 17 October 1861. Aboriginal people from the Nogoa River area, near modern-day Emerald, attacked Horatio Wills' newly formed pastoral station, resulting in the deaths of nineteen white settlers. One of the survivors, cricketer and Australian rules football founder Tom Wills, blamed the incident on Jesse Gregson, a local property manager who had previous to the attack went out and conducted a punitive mission with the aid of a detachment of Native Police under the command of A.M.G. Patrick against Aboriginal people in the area. In his own diaries, Gregson reveals that he accidentally shot Patrick in the leg during this preliminary dispersal. Gregson and other squatters were involved in the initial punitive raids after the massacre, with Lieutenant Cave being the first Native Police officer on the scene not long after. He was soon joined by officers G.P.M. Murray, Morehead and the Commandant John O'Connell Bligh, and together they conducted a number of shooting patrols. The Queensland Governor estimated that up to 300 Aboriginal people were indiscriminately killed in these retaliative operations. Inspectors John Marlow, G.P.M. Murray and Walter Compigne with Trooper Billy Elsewhere in the colony, Lieutenant Wheeler and his detachment of Native police killed eight innocent Aboriginal people at Caboolture. Lieutenant John Marlow and his Native police was attacked in the Maranoa Region, resulting in the deaths of thirteen Aboriginal males. In April 1861, George Elphinstone Dalrymple, the lands commissioner for the Leichhardt district, utilised two detachments of Native Police. Lieutenant Powell later conducting operations in that region. The Queensland government budget for the force in 1862 was £14,541 which allowed for 17 officers, 11 NCOs, 7 cadets and 134 troopers. 1864 restructure of the police David Thompson Seymour In 1864, all sections of police enforcement in Queensland underwent a major restructuring. Administration of the police, including that of the paramilitary Native Police, became centralised in Brisbane under the command of the Queensland Police Commissioner. The role of Commandant of the Native Police was abolished and the title of Lieutenant was replaced with Inspector. Although these changes to the Native Police appeared to give the force a more civilian role, in reality it remained a brutal instrument of enforcing British control in the colony. The new Commissioner, David Thompson Seymour, took up the position after resigning from the role of commanding officer of the British Army detachment in Queensland. Seymour recognised the importance of the Native Police in the British invasion of Aboriginal lands, and was focused on improving and expanding its capabilities. Seymour remained in the commanding role of the Native Police for thirty years, a period in which around 20,000 Aboriginal people were killed by this force. The mid 1860s was a period of great expansion of the British into the coastal and inland areas of north-eastern Australia. All these areas were of course inhabited by local Indigenous communities and the restructured, re-enhanced Native Police had a major role in the ruthless elimination of Aboriginal custodianship of the land. For example, in April 1864 the first British surveying group to assess the future site of Townsville left Bowen with the armed protection of eight troopers under the command of Inspector John Marlow and sub-Inspector E. B. Kennedy. This unit of Native Police conducted around four dispersals on this journey resulting in the deaths of at least 24 Aboriginal men. An unknown number of women and children were killed but it is recorded that 15 females were abducted by the troopers and taken back to the Don River barracks as \\"wives\\". Inspector Marlow, who had replaced Inspector Powell at Bowen in 1863, continued his work of \\"clearing the blacks\\" off the land after returning from this foundation expedition to Townsville. Earlier on in that year, Marlow had also provided a Native Police escort for the voyage of George Elphinstone Dalrymple to establish the town of Cardwell. Marlow's troopers here also \\"dispersed\\" and \\"rather cut up\\" some local Aboriginal people. The killing of Inspector Cecil Hill and subsequent massacres Dispersal of Aboriginal people In May 1865, after leading a shooting raid upon a camp of Aboriginal people at Pearl Creek near the modern day town of Duaringa, Inspector Cecil Hill was assassinated in a surprise revenge attack. Hill was the first Native Police officer in Australia to be killed in the Australian frontier wars. Chief Inspector G.P.M. Murray sent sub-Inspector Oscar Pescher and his troopers to conduct a series of reprisal raids in the district. Pescher's detachment was later reinforced by officers Blakeney and Bailey and their 12 troopers, the combined forces effecting a large massacre in the Expedition Range. In December 1864, an Aboriginal Native police officer under the command of sub-Inspector Thomas Coward's unit killed eight Aboriginal people at Belyando, while sub-Inspector Reginald Uhr with the aid of his troopers and local pastoralists killed a large number around Natal Downs. The Aboriginal Native police, under the command of Officer Rogers shot six in self defence at Glenmore, sub-Inspector Aubin doing likewise near Morinish and at Yaamba. Further north, sub-Inspector Robert Arthur Johnstone was leading killings of Aboriginal groups around Mackay and Nebo, while officers John Murray and Charles Blakeney headed sweeping destructive raids on the local people north of Cardwell. Inspector John Marlow, aided by the detachments of sub-Inspectors John Bacey Isley and Ferdinand Tompson, also continued his punitive missions around the Bowen and Proserpine areas. While in the Gulf Country of the colony, officer Wentworth D'Arcy Uhr and his troopers massacred around 60–100 native people in series of raids around Burketown. Near Hughenden sub- Inspector Frederick Murray also conducted several large \\"dispersals\\". Cecil Hill's brother, W.R.O. Hill, was also a Native Police officer and in 1867 he and his troopers slaughtered about ten Aboriginal people near the Warrego River In the same year, Native Police under the command Inspector Frederick Wheeler together with a number of armed pastoralists, perpetrated a very large massacre of native people at Goulbulba Hills near Emerald. Further expansion in the 1870s A section of Native Police As the British pastoralists moved further into the north and the west of the colony, so too did Commissioner David Thompson Seymour expand the operations of the Native Police. Not only were the numbers of troopers and officers increased but their weaponry also became more modernised. Long range, large bore Snider rifles gradually replaced the carbines and double-barreled rifles previously used. Thereby, from the early 1870s, what was already a lethal vehicle of colonisation became an even more formidable unit of extermination, especially when considering the fact that their targets were Aboriginal family groups often armed only with spears, waddies and boomerangs. =Far North Queensland & Torres Strait= In 1872, in the far north of the colony sub-Inspectors Robert Arthur Johnstone and Richard Crompton undertook a prolonged sweeping search of Hinchinbrook Island and the surrounding islets. Robert Arthur Johnstone In that same year, allegations that Johnstone conducted further massacres along the coast north of Cardwell during reprisal raids for the killing of the captain of the shipwrecked Maria vessel was raised in parliament by the Queensland Premier Arthur Hunter Palmer, to which he emphatically denied. Johnstone also prevented a number of Aboriginal people near the Whyandot station from helping shephards lambing. Johnstone and his troopers also committed numerous massacres at various places along the coast following the killing of whites at Green Island and during the 1873 North Queensland exploratory expedition led by George Elphinstone Dalrymple. In the Cumberland Islands, sub-Inspector George Nowlan led his troopers in a dispersal against the Ngaro people living on Whitsunday Island after they hijacked and burnt the Louisa Maria schooner. The Ngaro who survived fled in canoes to the mainland near Mackay and were further pursued by Sgt Graham and his troopers. Further north at Somerset on the tip of the Cape York Peninsula, officer Frank Jardine, who had previously murdered many Aboriginal people as a drover, led his troopers in massacres against the mainland Yadhaykenu people and the Kaurareg people of the Torres Strait after the crew of a ship were murdered by other people. In 1875, sub-Inspector H.M. Chester even managed to lead his troops in a number of pillaging raids of native villages along the Fly River as part of Luigi D'Albertis' journey to the uncolonised southern New Guinea region. At this time the northern goldfields at Palmer River, Cape River, Hodgkinson River and the Normanby River opened up, causing a massive influx of prospectors and miners. Native Police camps were quickly established in these areas to punish unreservedly any Aboriginal resistance. Sub- Inspectors Alexander Douglas-Douglas, Aulaire Morisset, George Townsend, Lionel Tower, Tom Coward and Stanhope O'Connor amongst others, conducted regular \\"dispersals\\" throughout the 1870s at these sites. In an 1876 first- hand description of one of these Native Police dispersals, Palmer River prospector Arthur Ashwin writes: > \\"Just as daylight was breaking we heard volley after volley of rifles. Jack > said the black trackers had got on to a mob of wild blacks. We went over the > next day and found the niggers camp, they must have been a hundred strong. > There were two large fires still alight where the trackers had burnt the > dead bodies. We were very lucky the trackers were ahead of us and cleaned > this bit of country of the blacks\\" A journalist in Cooktown recalled how Douglas' troopers would make notches on the stocks of their rifles for every person they killed in the \\"nigger raids\\". One had 25 notches of which nine were added in a week. In an example of another massacre, Stanhope O'Connor and his troopers killed about 30 Aboriginal people to the north of Cooktown at Cape Bedford. Very soon after committing this mass-killing, O'Connor and his unit were sent to Victoria to help in the capture of Ned Kelly, the famous bushranger. In the late 1870s, around the Mossman River region, sub-Inspector Robert Little was regularly dispersing groups of native inhabitants. =West and Southwest Queensland= The Etheridge goldfields in the vicinity of Georgetown also were discovered around this time and as in the north-east of the colony, Native Police barracks were soon constructed. In 1871, sub-Inspector Denis McCarthy and his unit shot dead 17 local Aboriginal people who had murdered Mr. Corbett near Gilberton. North of Boulia, sub-Inspector Eglinton shot a large number of Aboriginal people following the killing of four drovers. At Bladensburg near Winton at least 100 local tribespeople were shot down by the detachment of sub-Inspector Moran. In 1876, two detachments of Native police under the command of Sub-Inspectors William Armit and Lyndon Poingdestre attacked a large number of Aboriginal people displaying \\"determined resistance\\" at Creen Creek after they had attacked a telegraph station. Alexander Douglas-Douglas In the southwest of the colony many additional dispersals of Aboriginal people in the 1870s occurred at the hands of the Native Police. After the killings of pastoralists such as Welford, Maloney and Dowling, Native Police based at places like Tambo and Thargomindah went on numerous punitive expeditions, often assisted by stockmen. For example, sub-Inspector Armstrong dispersed a camp in the Cheviot Range, sub-Inspector Gilmour did likewise near the future towns of Betoota and Birdsville. Sub-Inspectors Gough and Kaye led a lengthy mission of dispersals from Bluff Station near Birdsville north to Glengyle Station. Other officers such as Cheeke, Dunne and Stafford led further missions throughout this decade. In 1876, two officers in the force were charged with murder. In the first case, Sub-Inspector John Carroll stationed at Aramac, shot one of his troopers dead and flogged another after one of them attempted to poison them. He was also charged for chaining up an Aboriginal woman by her legs continuously for a month. All charges were thrown out. In the second case, Inspector Frederick Wheeler was charged after a prolonged and brutal flogging of an Aboriginal man, who later died from peritonitis at the Belyando barracks. Public incidents like these forced the government into a commission of enquiry in regards to ameliorating the condition of Aboriginal people. After some initial research, the commission requested a grant of £1600 from parliament to implement reserves for the Indigenous population. Parliament quickly denied these funds and in 1878 the commission was wound up. Intense conflict 1880–1884 Skirmish with Native Police at Creen Creek Despite not being willing to fund a small Aboriginal welfare program, the Queensland government did find the extra thousands of pounds required to expand the Native Police to its height of strength in the early 1880s. By 1882 Commissioner Seymour had 184 officers and troopers in this force at his disposal. With this increase of manpower more violence ensued. The year 1881 in particular had several notable incidents of murder. In February, sub- Inspector George Dyas was speared and clubbed to death by Aboriginal people near the isolated town of Croydon. Sub-Inspector Kaye was speared through the heart and killed in a desperate defensive action by an Aboriginal man. Many Indigenous people were killed following this incident. Some fled the shootings by going to another town in Gilberton and sought protection with the normal police there. Later that same year Mary Watson, the wife of a beche-de-mer fisherman at Lizard Island was attacked by local Aboriginal people. A Chinese workman named Ah Leong was killed and Mary, her baby and another workman named Ah Sam escaped in a large iron boiling pot which was quickly improvised into a makeshift raft. It was assumed that the three were later killed by Aboriginal people from the McIvor River to the north of Cooktown. Sub-Inspector Hervey Fitzgerald led a series of reprisal raids in which \\"tenfold vengeance has been exacted\\". It was later discovered that Mrs Watson, her baby and Ah Sam had drifted onto a nearby island and died of thirst. In January 1883, near the mining township of Cloncurry, the local Kalkadoon and Maithakari people attacked a Native Police camp which resulted in the death of a Native Police officer. Sub-Inspector Marcus Beresford was also beaten to death and several of his troopers wounded. A massacre perpetrated by the Native Police were afterwards conducted, but in the following year the Kalkadoon were still able to kill the well-known pastoralist James Powell at Calton Hills. In response, sub-Inspector Frederic Urquhart, his troopers tracked down a group of around 150 Kalkadoon. This dispersal came to be known as the conflict of Battle Mountain. Urquhart and his troopers stayed in the area on continuous patrol killing more Aboriginal people for a further nine weeks. The Irvinebank massacre The Irvinebank massacre of October 1884 is widely regarded as the turning point of the Native Police from which a gradual reduction in the force began. Sub-Inspector William Nichols, who was involved in the earlier Woolgar killings, was stationed with his troopers at the Nigger Creek barracks. He led a patrol to Irvinebank which resulted in two Aboriginal males being captured and shot dead, followed by the slaughter of an old man, two women and child. The government of Samuel Griffith pursued murder charges against Nichols and his troopers. While the seven troopers were kept in prison on remand for some time, the charges against Nichols were quickly thrown out due to a lack of evidence. Nichols was dismissed from the force, and some detachments of Native Police were disbanded and replaced with normal police units. The operations of the Native Police, however, still continued relatively unabated for the rest of the 1880s with the force receiving more modern weaponry in the form of Martini-Henry rifles in 1884. Frederic Urquhart Examples of the further conflict include reports by sub-Inspector James Lamond, based at the Carl Creek barracks near the Lawn Hill run of Frank Hann, that the Native police shot \\"over 100 blacks\\" from 1883 to 1885 on that pastoral lease alone. Frank Hann, his property manager Jack Watson and Frank Shadforth on the neighbouring Lilydale station also shot large numbers of Aboriginal people in this region themselves. Hann himself was wounded in a violent encounter on Lawn Hill station with the Aboriginal outlaw, Joe Flick. In this shoot-out, Flick killed Native Police sub-Inspector Alfred Wavell before dying of wounds himself. Near the Batavia River in the extreme far north, sub-Inspector Frederic Urquhart dispersed a large number of Aboriginal people following the killing of pastoralist Edmund Watson, with Urquhart being speared in the leg during this operation. In the rainforest areas of far north eastern coast, the dispersals also continued. Naturalist Robert Grant observed a number of massacres by the Native Police during his scientific expedition to the Atherton Tableland region in the late 1880s. He obtained two Aboriginal children after one of these massacres, one of which was a boy who he took back to New South Wales and raised in Scottish tradition. This boy became Douglas Grant, the notable Aboriginal who fought for the British Empire in World War I. Changing of policy from 1890 By 1890, atrocities by the Native Police were coming under increased scrutiny from members of the public and the media. A.J. Vogan's novel 'Black Police', published in that year, was closely based on incidents that Vogan said he saw or investigated in 1888–1889. The book included stories of massacres committed by the Queensland Native Police in close cooperation with settlers antagonistic to the presence of Aboriginal people on or near their runs. Continued newspaper focus on incidents, an increasingly influential social criticism, and the shifting of the colonial frontier into the Northern Territory and British New Guinea eventually had some effect on changing the Queensland government's policy of \\"dispersal\\". William Parry- Okeden In 1889, two police officials in the Herberton area, Charles Hansen and Andrew Zillman, experimented with allocating rations to displaced Aboriginal people instead of shooting them. They found that the trial was a success with an almost complete reduction in the spearing of cattle and settler casualties. Leading officials of the Queensland government, in particular the Colonial Secretary Horace Tozer, opted to expand the funding of the rationing experiment. As a result, the Native Police budget was dramatically reduced with only 45 troopers and a handful of officers being employed in 1895. 1895 also saw David Thompson Seymour, the long serving Queensland Police Commissioner who commanded the exterminating operations of the Native Police for thirty years, replaced with the more moderate William Parry-Okeden. Also in that year, Tozer commissioned Archibald Meston to conduct a thorough research report into the condition of Aboriginal people in the colony. Meston recommended the often discussed proposal of segregating Aboriginal people from white society and forcibly detaining them on isolated reserves. This report was largely accepted by the government and led to the passing of the Aboriginal Protection Act of 1897. For most Aboriginal people in the colony of Queensland, this meant that they faced a reduced likelihood of being shot but also had almost all aspects of their lives controlled by the government. Even though Meston recommended the immediate disbanding of the Native Police, this aspect was rejected with Native Police units continuing to operate out of a number of barracks on the Cape York Peninsula and in the Gulf Country. Operations from 1890 to 1905 Musgrave barracks around 1898 Despite many Native Police troopers in this period being decommissioned or redeployed as unarmed trackers working with normal police squads and, in addition, a considerable number of mission stations being turned into feeding stations for the local Aboriginal population. In 1893, a very large group consisting of 20 Native Police troopers led by sub-Inspector Charles Savage, together were sent to investigate the murders of Charles Bruce and Captain Rowe near the Ducie River in the far north. Aboriginal people in this area had murdered at least eight men. When the Native police encountered about 300 attacking Aboriginal people, a sharp engagement occurred, killing five troopers. In 1894, the Aboriginal head man responsible for the murder of Bill Baird was captured. After the murder of Donald MacKenzie at Lakefield station in 1896, the Native Police found many of the local tribe dead from arsenic poisoning when they mistook the poison for baking powder. Drawing by Aboriginal boy Oscar of a Native Police dispersal Toward the border with the Northern Territory in the Gulf Country, the last operational barracks in this region was at Turn Off Lagoon near to where the modern-day community of Doomadgee is now located. In 1896 after the murder of Cresswell Downs manager, Thomas Perry, this unit shot a large number of Aboriginal people in that region. Indiscriminate dispersals also followed the spearing of Harry Shadforth at Wollogorang Station in 1897. Constables Richard Alford and Timothy Lyne were in charge of these troopers at this time. An Aboriginal boy named Oscar who was kidnapped from the Cooktown area by Native Police and brought to work at Rocklands station near Camooweal, made some unique recordings of the operations of the Native Police based at Turn Off Lagoon. From 1895 to 1899, Oscar produced a number of drawings depicting Native Police troopers shooting tribal Aboriginal people either as they were running away or as they were tied to trees. Native Police detachment at Turn Off Lagoon barracks 1898 While travelling near the Wenlock River, Reverend Gilbert White and anthropologist Walter Roth were shown the remains of four local Aboriginal men shot dead by Native Police in a surprise attack. Reports reached Commissioner William Parry-Okeden and a large investigation ensued. The officer in charge, constable John Hoole was acquitted of any wrongdoing but was transferred and soon after forced into retirement. By 1909, the only functional Native Police barracks remaining was at Coen but this was manned by only several veteran troopers. This barracks finally closed in 1929. Native police still officially had a role in Queensland until at least the 1960s with unarmed troopers being assigned to maintain control in Aboriginal isolation and detention facilities such as the Palm Island facility. Eddie Mabo gave a description of these native police on his visit to Palm Island in 1957. South Australia Commissioner Alexander Tolmer formed the South Australian Native Police Force in 1852 at the specific direction of the South Australian Government. Later that year a newspaper reported, \\"A dozen powerful natives, chiefly of the Moorundee tribe [from Blanchetown, South Australia district on the River Murray], have been selected to be sent to the Port Lincoln district to act as Mounted Police.\\" The little corps, under the command of Mounted Police Corporal John Cusack (1809–1887), sailed for Port Lincoln on the government schooner Yatala on 29 December 1852, for service on Eyre Peninsula. It was confidently expected they would be usefully employed in protection of the settlers in that district. The Native Police were soon extended, the strength in 1856 being:- Murray District (based at Moorundee and Wellington): 2 inspectors, 2 corporals, 13 constables, 16 horses; Venus Bay: 1 sergeant, 1 corporal, 7 constables, 8 horses; and at Port Augusta: 3 constables and 2 horses. The six officers were all European, while the twenty- three constables were all Aboriginal, all being issued with standard police arms and uniforms. Both Aboriginal and European offenders were brought to justice by these men, but on the Eyre Peninsula the Aboriginal people were largely ineffectual as they were in unfamiliar territory, while on the Murray the majority of the troopers abandoned the force to work on nearby farms and did not return.Clyne, R. E., Colonial Blue, p120-121. The force appears to have had a limited role in frontier conflict as much of the violence associated with the British invasion had already passed in the regions in which they were stationed. In 1857 it was abolished as a distinct corps, although a few Aboriginal constables continued to be employed from time to time at certain remote police stations. Also, Aboriginal trackers were employed as needed, but were not sworn police constables. In 1884 a native police scheme was revived by the South Australia Police in Central Australia (see Northern Territory, below), and the operations of this force were similar to the notorious Queensland and New South Wales corps.  Northern Territory  In 1884, the South Australian Police Commissioner, William John Peterswald established a Native Police Force. Six Aboriginal men were recruited in November 1884. Aged between 17 and 26 years of age, they came from Alice Springs, Charlotte Waters, Undoolya and Macumba. The Native Police became notorious for their violent activities, especially under the command of Constable William Willshire. In 1891, two Aboriginal men were 'shot whilst attempting to escape'. The deaths were noticed and the South Australian Register called for an Enquiry to establish whether or not police had been justified in killing the two Aboriginal men. Eventually, F. J. Gillen, Telegraph Stationmaster and Justice of the Peace at Alice Springs, received instructions from the Government to investigate the matter and report to the Attorney-General. Gillen found Willshire responsible for ordering the killings. At the conclusion of Gillen's investigation, Willshire was suspended, arrested and charged with murder. He became the first Northern Territory police officer charged with this offence. He was subsequently acquitted.Refer to Wilson, W.R. A Force Apart, PhD Thesis, NT University 2000 and The Establishment of, and Operations by The Northern Territory Native Police 1884–1891, Journal of NT History, No 7, 1996.  Nauru  Australian and British forces took command of Nauru from German control in late 1914. The Germans had set up their own Native Police force on the island with the troopers being from New Guinea. These quickly changed allegiance to the British and were utilised maintaining order over the Kanaka and Chinese coolie labourers mining the guano deposits. By the 1920s the troopers were mostly from Tuvalu and the Gilbert Islands with some local men and Maori from New Zealand also being employed. In 1930, the Native Police subdued a riot amongst the Chinese workers which saw one trooper killed and 18 labourers injured. During World War II many troopers remained loyal to the British and conducted espionage operations while Nauru was under Japanese control. After the war, the island and its Native Police returned to being under Anglo-Australian administration. In 1948, Chinese guano mining workers went on strike over pay and conditions. The Administrator for Nauru, Eddie Ward, imposed a state of emergency with the Native Police and armed volunteers of locals and Australian officials being mobilised. This force, using sub-machine guns and other firearms, opened fire on the Chinese workers killing two and wounding sixteen. Around 50 of the workers were arrested and two of these were bayoneted to death while in custody. The Native Police trooper who bayoneted the prisoners was charged but later acquitted on grounds that the wounds were \\"accidentally received.\\" The governments of the Soviet Union and China made official complaints against Australia at the United Nations over this incident. The Native Police was eventually replaced with a civilian police force once Nauru became self-governing in 1966.

View from Helgeandsholmen. One of the often occurring demonstrations at Mynttorget. Mynttorget (, \\"the Coin Square\\") is a public square in Gamla stan, the old town in central Stockholm, Sweden.  Setting  From the square the bridge Stallbron leads over to the Parliament island Helgeandsholmen; to the west the street Myntgatan leads to Riddarhustorget, while the quay Kanslikajen stretches along the waterfront; Västerlånggatan stretches south through the medieval old town; and eastward the ramps of the Royal Palace, Lejonbacken, leads up to the palace's northern entrance, while the quay Slottskajen passes along the canal Stallkanalen. Overlooking the square is the terrace Högvaktsterrassen. Its central location between the Parliament, Kanslihuset (\\"The Secretariat House\\" or \\"The Chancellery\\"), and the Royal Palace, makes it a popular spot for political manifestations of various kinds. On N.4 Stockholms Stads Brandförsäkringskontor (\\"The Stockholm Fire Insurance Office\\"), in short Brandkontoret, was established in 1746 as a result of the devastating fire at the Royal Palace in 1697. It is thus the oldest insurance company in Sweden, a company owned by its insured customers. In 1806 the building was acquired and the office of Brandkontoret has since then been located here. The building was earlier known as the Rosendal Palace (Rosendalska palatset), designed by C F Adelcrantz (1716–1796) and Erik Palmstedt (1741–1803) in a transitional style bridging Rococo and Gustavian Classicism, in 1773–1780 the location of the Royal Academy of the Arts. The insurance company Skandia, today one of the dominant actors, was founded in 1855, originally occupying only three rooms in 1, Mynttorget, the building on the square's southern side. The building is today occupied by the Parliament.  History  Mynttorget was named because of its proximity to the royal mint (Kungliga myntet), which, during the period 1696–1850 was located by the square, and the name appears on a map dated 1733. While coins have been stamped in the capital since 1310 the original location of the royal mint is not known, the facility was located west of the palace Tre Kronor in the early-15th century (e.g. directly south of the square), but was moved between the residences of the various Mint Masters during the late Middle Ages. During the regency of Gustav Vasa, the mint was located on a former islet near today's Nationalmuseum called Kyrkholmen or even Myntholmen. Later, it was relocated first to Riddarholmen and then Helgeandsholmen. As the northern gate of the city was rebuilt in the 17th century, a defensive tower, Norre port, was demolished in 1672 to give space to a new mint by the square, which was completed in 1696. This latter building was however demolished in 1784, to be replaced by a new building housing the Government Offices, completed in 1790 and furnished with the four doric columns today reused for the portico of Kanslihuset. Being located near the Swedish Parliament, many demonstrations and protests have taken place there. Greta Thunberg sat there during many of her school strikes for climate.

The operating system, and thus the game, was officially released on April 7, 2003. The game itself was developed by American studio oopdreams software, Inc. Jawbreaker is officially listed as one of the \\"Core Applications\\" of the Windows Mobile software family, in a paper released by Microsoft. In Windows Mobile 5.0 and Windows Mobile 6.0 it is called Bubble Breaker. The original non-bundled version of the game is available from the developer itself as Bubblets. Gameplay The game-board consists of a screen of differently-colored balls arranged in a matrix. There are five different colors: red, blue, green, yellow and purple. The player then clicks on any two or more connecting similarly-colored balls to eliminate them from the matrix, earning an appropriate number of points in the process. The more balls eliminated at once, the higher the points added to the player's score. The scoring can be expressed in the formula \\"Y=X(X-1)\\". X represents the number of balls grouped together, Y is the resulting score. For example an elimination of 16 balls will result in 240 points (240=16(16-1)). In the standard mode of the game, the game ends when the player has no more moves left; there are no more like-colored balls adjacent to each other. The screen immediately goes to the scoring screen, where statistics such as Average Score, Total Score and Games Played can be seen, along with a button that the player can press in order to start a new game. Game Options and ModesBreaker Set= The Breaker Set option allows the player to choose between Colorful Breakers and Greyscale Breakers. The first option is the default and sets the game balls' colors to the standard five colors. Choosing the latter changes the color palette and instead of differently- colored balls, the balls are adorned with various unique greyscale patterns allowing players with monochromatic Pocket PCs to play the game, as well as players who may be colorblind and have trouble differentiating the colored balls from one another. Some of the patterns include lightly colored balls, dark grey balls and a white ball with a dark dot in the middle. =Game Styles= The player has four unique game styles to choose from, including Standard, which is described above. The other game styles are Continuous, Shifter and MegaShift. :Continuous is one of the game styles available for Jawbreaker. This particular mode is similar to the standard mode, with one major difference. Whenever the player clears an entire column of balls, a new one arrives from the left side of the game board. New columns can be previewed in a small area at the bottom of the screen. As with the regular standard mode, the game ends when the player runs out of adjacent like-colored balls. :MegaShift is another one of the game styles available for Jawbreaker. The major difference in this mode is the addition of a new column of balls whenever the player manages to clear an entire column of balls from the game board. Balls will always move to the right of the screen if there is space for them to do so. The newly-appearing column of balls can be previewed at the bottom of the screen before they are brought on-board and they appear from the leftmost side of the game board. As with the other modes, the game ends when the player ceases to have any moves left. :Shifter is one of the game styles available for Jawbreaker. This game mode is similar to the MegaShift mode in that balls will tend to gravitate towards the right part of the game board. Unlike MegaShift mode however, the board has a finite number of balls and no new balls arrive to replenish the ones the player clicks off the game board. History Windows Mobile 2003 was Jawbreaker's first inclusion into a packaged handheld operating system. Pocket PC operating systems prior to Windows Mobile 2003, ending with Pocket PC 2002 did not include the game. It has since been bundled with succeeding Windows Mobile releases, including Windows Mobile 2003 SE (second edition) and Windows Mobile 5.0 & 6.0. Jawbreaker in Other Operating Systems Aside from being included in the Windows Mobile operating system, Jawbreaker is also distributed by Oopdreams Software, Inc. under another name, Bubblets. Bubblets is almost-identical to Jawbreaker, with some slight visual and semantic differences. Instead of balls, the player bursts bubbles, thus the name. Bubblets in this form is available for a much broader range of operating systems than the Jawbreaker version. The game is officially distributed as shareware for Pocket PC 2002/Windows Mobile 2003, Palm OS, and the Handheld PC Pro platforms. Bubblets is also available for desktop PCs, with the official Windows version of Bubblets, also distributed as expiring shareware. As Bubblets, the game was a finalist for the Best Puzzle Game category of Pocket PC Magazine's Pocket PC Award Winners of 2001, won by another SameGame clone called PocketPop produced by PocketFun (http://www.pocketfun.co.uk/PocketPopRevenge.html). It was given the People's Choice Award in the same event. The Palm OS version of the game Bubblet, was favorably reviewed by PDAStreet's Palm Boulevard. Geek.com gave Bubblets a perfect score on their review and was named a Geek.com pick. The game has also been distributed as freeware for mobiles since June 2008. The mobile phone version, also called JawBreaker, was developed for those who did not have Jawbreaker-capable PDAs but had phones supporting Java ME. This iteration of the game could be run on mobile devices supporting Java ME CLDC 1.1/MIDP 2.0 with screen resolutions of 240×320 or 176×220.

The station is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc. and serves the Portsmouth-Dover-Rochester media market, also heard in Southern Maine. WPKX broadcasts at 5000 watts around the clock from a transmitter off Route 108 in Rochester. To protect other stations on 930 kHz, WPKX uses a directional antenna at night. History WPKX signed on in 1947 as WWNH, owned by Strafford Broadcasting Corporation. Initially, a 1,000 watt daytimer, the station boosted power to 5,000 watts in 1954 and added night service, with the same power in 1967. WWNH was an easy listening station by 1971; that year, the station began an affiliation with CBS Radio. It became a contemporary station in 1974. An FM sister station, WWNH-FM (96.7 FM; now WQSO) was added October 21, 1979. Strafford Broadcasting Corporation sold WWNH to Salmanson Communications Partners in 1987; by then, the station had a country music format. Salmanson later changed the call letters to WKOS (matching the WKOS-FM call letters adopted by 96.7 in 1987) and the format to adult standards, via the AM Only service from Transtar Radio Networks (now America's Best Music from Westwood One). (The WWNH call letters were reassigned to 1340 AM in Madbury, which operated from 1989 to 2010.) Another sale, this time to Bear Broadcasting Company, followed in 1990; Bear again changed the station's call letters and format, this time to WZNN and all-news, largely via a simulcast of CNN Headline News. In 1994, WZNN was again sold, this time to Precision Media, owner of WMYF (1540 AM, now WXEX) and WERZ (107.1 FM); Precision reverted the station to standards in 1995, a format it also ran on WMYF. However, although WZNN and WMYF simulcast a local morning show, the station could not air the Stardust programming WMYF aired the remainder of the day, as WZNN's signal overlapped with that network's Lakes Region affiliate, WASR; as a result, the station rejoined AM Only. WPKX's logo while simulcasting with WMYF, used from April 2011 through 2013 Precision Media sold its stations in the market to American Radio Systems in 1997. ARS soon applied to transition WZNN to an expanded band allocation on 1700 kHz, with proposed call letters WAYU. It then sold WZNN and WAYU, along with its other Seacoast properties, to Capstar Broadcasting in the midst of a merger with CBS Radio. Capstar converted WZNN and WMYF to a simulcast of Manchester sister station WGIR (an arrangement billed on-air as the \\"Action News Network\\") in September 1998, with 930 taking the WGIN callsign soon afterward. (The standards format would later be revived, under the WMYF callsign, on 1380 AM; that station, after several format changes, shut down in 2015 and last held the call sign WPLA.) Along with the WGIR simulcast came an affiliation with NBC Radio, which was subsequently phased out by Westwood One in favor of CNN Radio. A few months later, Capstar merged with fellow Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst subsidiary Chancellor Media to form AMFM Broadcasting, which itself announced a merger with Clear Channel Communications (now known as iHeartMedia) several months afterward. In the meantime, plans for WAYU were abandoned, and its construction permit was canceled on December 22, 2000. The station picked up Fox News Radio in the mid-2000s after Clear Channel signed a larger agreement with the service. In April 2011, WGIN dropped the WGIR simulcast and began to simulcast WMYF (by then an all-sports station affiliated with ESPN Radio); on February 7, 2012, the call sign was changed to WPKX. Most of the syndicated programming previously heard on WGIN is now carried on sister station WQSO. In 2013, the simulcast with WMYF ended and WPKX shifted to Fox Sports Radio. Programming Most of WPKX's programming is provided by Fox Sports Radio. The station also carries play-by-play of the Boston Bruins, the New Hampshire Fisher Cats (in contrast to WMYF's broadcasts of the Portland Sea Dogs, and the New Hampshire Wildcats (serving as co-flagship of the Wildcat Sports Network with WGIR and WQSO).

Pultney Dana (1820–1852) established the Native Police Corps in the Port Phillip District (later Victoria) in 1842, he was responsible for two massacres of Aboriginal people one at Barmah Lake in 1843 and the other at Snowy River at 1846. Dana was born in England, his father being Captain William Pulteney Dana of the 6th Regiment. Henry Dana migrated to Van Diemen's Land (later Tasmania) in 1840, but in 1842 he relocated to the Port Phillip District where he renewed acquaintance with Superintendent Charles La Trobe, whom he knew in London. The two men became firm friends and Latrobe appointed Dana to establish a native police corps. Twenty-five Aborigines from various Gippsland tribes were enlisted at the depot at Narre Warren, and trained for mounted police duty by Dana and his second-in-command, Dudley Le Souef, under the general supervision of the assistant protector of Aborigines, William Thomas. Dana's police force lasted longer than the original corps set up by Christiaan de Villiers in 1837, partly because Dana made some allowances for the Aborigines' traditional way of life. For example, during summer the troopers were generally allowed to rejoin their communities to take part in cultural activities. The Corps was controversial due to Dana's emphasis on the use of force, rather than arrest. For example, one trooper is reported to have said: \\"Captain say big one stupid catch them very good shoot them, you blackfellows, no shoot them me hand cuff you and send you to jail.\\" The Native Police Corps is estimated to have killed 125 indigenous Australians between 1835 and 1850.Ben Kiernan, 2008, Blood and Soil: Modern Genocide 1500-2000, Carlton, Melbourne University Press, p.295 Specific massacres of Aboringal people include the LaTrobe Valley, Barmah Lake and Snowy River massacres. Dana made no real use of the tracking skills of his troops and used them in the more traditional role of mounted police. While they proved useful to the pastoralists who were rapidly taking over traditional Aboriginal land. Requiring Aborigines to arrest and even shoot down their own people proved demoralising for both sides. Dana was responsible for a massacre at Barmah Lake in 1843 where around 26 Aboriginal people were killed. Dana was speared in the thigh. The official report did not mention the murders and when challenged on the truthiness of the report Dana's reply was that \\"persons unconnected with the public service know nothing of reports ... being apt to blurt out statements more properly held in reserve.\\" On January 5, 1844, a man called Allan, called at GA Robinson's office in Melbourne and told him In 1844 Dana sent a letter to La Trobe reporting that he had just completed a second tour of the district: ‘from observation and information this part of the Province is perfectly free from any thing like outrages by the blacks...\\" Dana was responsible for a massacre at Snowy River on 16 Dec 1846 against the where 15 Tatungalung or Krauatungulung were murdered. According to historian A.G.L. Shaw the number killed was between 15 and 23.Shaw, A G L 1996, A history of the Port Phillip District: Victoria before separation, Melbourne University Press, Melbourne. P. 133. When the Gold Rush began in Victoria in 1851, the Native Police Corps was the only organised government force in the areas to which miners began to flock, and were used to enforce the authority of the early goldfields commissioners. However, Dana antagonised the gold diggers at Ballarat in September 1851 with his rigorous attempt to collect the first licence fees. On 24 November 1852 Dana died of pneumonia, having suffered severe exposure while on a search for bushrangers, and the corps was disbanded early in 1853. Dana was married and had four children.

This extends to the protection of shipwrecks, sunken cities, prehistoric art work, treasures that may be looted, sacrificial and burial sites, and old ports that cover the oceans' floors.http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/underwater-cultural- heritage/the-underwater-heritage/ The preservation of underwater cultural heritage is significant as it allows for the retelling of numerous historical events. As part of its duty to conduct scientific research and provide continuous education on the importance of underwater cultural heritage, UNESCO strives to maintain these sites for the enjoyment of current and future generations. The convention may provide a customary framework to help raise awareness and seek to combat the illegal looting and pirating occurring in waters worldwide. As an international body, member states of the convention agree to work towards the preservation of sunken cultural property within their jurisdiction and the high seas. Cultural heritage As an international body, UNESCO continues to work towards the preservation of cultural goods worldwide. Similar to cultural property, only physical goods that are bestowed to future generations may fall into the protection of cultural heritage. It is thus a form of inheritance that allows current and future generations to learn about significant historical events.Frigo, Manlio. \\"Cultural property v. cultural heritage: A 'battle of concepts' in international law?.\\" International Review of the Red Cross 86.854 (2004): 367–78 at 369. Particular to the concept of heritage, international agreements exist under the Council of Europe such as the 1885 Convention on the Protection of Archaeological Heritage of Europe and the European Convention on the Protection of Archaeological Heritage. These bodies create broad legal protections around cultural heritage antiquities and sites that are specific to communities worldwide. The 1954 Hague Convention was truly the first international convention that attempted to discuss the protection of cultural heritage. In defining property that is considered 'important' and 'valuable' for the good of the people, the issue of protecting cultural property became noticeable to international parties.Forrest, C. J. S. (2002). \\"Defining 'underwater cultural heritage'\\". The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology, 31(1), 3–11. doi:10.1006/ijna.2002.1022 p.3 It was only in the 1972 UNESCO Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, that the term 'cultural heritage' was employed to define the cultural objects to be protected at an international level.Forrest, C. J. S. (2002). \\"Defining 'underwater cultural heritage'\\". The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology, 31(1), 3–11. doi:10.1006/ijna.2002.1022 p. 7 However, due to its expansive definition, the concept of cultural heritage was further revised in the 1992 European Convention on the Protection of Archaeological Heritage. They serve to assert the universal value of protecting cultural objects that make up the history and identity of nations. Along with the 100-year limitation period, the 2001 UNESCO Convention included the phrase 'cultural, historical or archaeological character' as the qualifying concepts that define underwater cultural heritage.Forrest, C. J. S. (2002). \\"Defining 'underwater cultural heritage'\\". The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology, 31(1), 3–11. doi:10.1006/ijna.2002.1022 p. 8 Because many objects of cultural heritage lose their significance when taken out of water, this convention seeks to ensure the preservation of sunken sites. Content ;Official text The official text of the convention sets out the obligations of the states parties in regards to the protection of underwater cultural heritage, defined in Article 1 as: \\"all traces of human existence having a cultural, historical or archaeological character which have been partially or totally under water, periodically or continuously, for at least 100 years\\" Articles 1–4 define the Convention and its objectives, as well as its relation to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the law of salvage. Articles 5–12 define varying levels of obligations and procedures within the four maritime zones (Territorial Sea, Contiguous Zone, Exclusive Economic Zone, The Area) defined by UNCLOS. Articles 13–21 define further obligations, such as seizing illicitly recovered underwater cultural heritage, cooperating with other state parties, and providing training in underwater archaeology. Articles 22–35 clarify a number of points relevant to the functional aspects of the Convention, such as the creation of statutory bodies, the settlement of disputes between states parties, and modes of ratification. ; ;Annex In addition to the official text of the convention, an annex of 36 rules governs the practical aspects of activities directed at underwater cultural heritage. State parties are required to ensure that these rules are applied within their territorial sea and contiguous zone, and also that they are adhered to by all nationals and flag vessels. Rules 1–8 define general principles. Key among these are the complete prohibition of the commercial exploitation of underwater cultural heritage and the principle that in situ preservation should always be considered as a first option. The rules also cover aspects such as project design, conservation, documentation, and reporting. International law Situated between admiralty/private maritime law, the law of the sea, and cultural heritage law, the legal framework of underwater cultural heritage law is robust. Admiralty law is a branch entrenched within private international law relating to the control of maritime practices between private entities.Dromgoole, S. (2013). Underwater cultural heritage and international law. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 8 Activities that fall under the protection of admiralty law include marine operations, marine salvaging, shipping and receiving. Subject to the common law jurisdiction and handled within domestic court systems, the body of admiralty law seeks to protect the rights and interests of private parties, with respect to practices at sea. On a broader level, this law seeks to fulfil public policy objectives including the safety of life and property, while ensuring the protection of the global marine environments.Dromgoole, S. (2013). Underwater cultural heritage and international law. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 9 The public international law body of the law of the sea was established to manage inter-state relations regarding practices in international waters. This complex body of law has grown to develop its own principles, particular methods of enforcement and Tribunals. Its primary objective is to create a supportive legal framework to determine the rights and duties of states with respect to their use of the ocean. In 1982, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) was developed to govern the deep-sea beds vis-à-vis increasing commercial exploitation of sunken objects.Dromgoole, S. (2013). Underwater cultural heritage and international law. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 10 In light of the emergence of newly independent states, a need was created for an international legal body that would help protect underwater cultural goods, in waters used by many parties worldwide. Resulting from the third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III) between 1973 and 1982, the Convention has created many new regulations applicable to nation states. Once signed, the Convention had established two maritime zones with governing international regulations, affixed the maximum depth-level at sea at twelve miles, created specific regimes for international and archipelagic states, and introduced three new international institutions. The 2001 UNESCO Convention on the Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage is a product of international agreement on the adequate conduct of member states at sea. Its legal framework stems from two distinct sections of UNCLOS, including article 149 and 303. Article 149 of UNCLOS provides that: \\" All objects of an archaeological and historical nature found in the Area shall be preserved or disposed of for the benefit of mankind as a whole, particular regard being paid to the preferential rights of the State or country of origin, or the State of cultural origin, or the State of historical and archaeological origin.\\" http://www.law.berkeley.edu/files/Bautista-final.pdf Article 303 of UNCLOS states that: \\"1. States have the duty to protect objects of an archaeological and historical nature found at sea and shall cooperate for this purpose. 2\\\\. In order to control traffic on such objects, the coastal State may, in applying article 33, presume that their removal from the seabed in the zone referred to in that article without its approval would result in an infringement within its territory or territorial sea of the laws and regulations referred to in that article. 3\\\\. Nothing in this article affects the rights of identifiable owners, the law of salvage or other rules of admiralty, or laws or practices with respect to cultural heritage. 4\\\\. This article is without prejudice to other international agreements and rules of international law regarding the protection of objects of an archaeological and historical nature.\\" To ensure that member states abide by the regulations stipulated within the Convention, they are to further adopt the following; 1 Each Party is to adopt domestic legislation that prohibits nationals and vessels from engaging in activities that would purposely interfere with the protection of underwater cultural heritage 2 Each Party is to require that all nationals and vessels report any new discoveries to UNESCO and fellow member states that are considered to be a part of underwater cultural heritage located in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), the Continental shelf and Area 3 Each Party is to take appropriate measures to prevent the dealing of objects considered to be underwater cultural heritage. This includes the illicit sale or exportation, as well as trade or seizing of the object found in their territory. Significant cases A recorded 22 earthquakes between 320 and 1303 AD on the coast of Pharos in Egypt shook the city of Alexandria, which was home to Pharos Lighthouse. The effects of these earthquakes, and several more in the centuries that followed suggest that the large monument may have fallen into the sea, leaving massive blocks of stone awaiting the exploration mission led by archaeologist Jean-Yves Empereur in 1994. While many components of the old lighthouse are on display at the Kom el-Dikka museum in Alexandria, archaeologists suggest that around 500 pieces remain on the sea floor. Today, the Alexandria Lighthouse is one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. On July 19, 1545, the British Fleet known as the Mary Rose sunk to the bottom of the Portsmouth Harbour, in the United Kingdom. While its failures still remain a mystery, is estimated that at least 500 men were trapped in the ship, and only 35 of these escaped to safety Attenborough, G. (2013). The Mary Rose Museum (Portsmouth). The Journal of Transport History, 34(2), 198. In 1982, sixty million people watched as the vessel was lifted out of its resting place, with its 19,000 discovered objects still intact. Due to the preservation of this monument of underwater cultural heritage in the Mary Rose museum, the public can continue to enjoy the vessel and all of her artifacts. Off the coast of Sweden in 1628, the pride of the Swedish Navy, the Vasa sunk deep beneath the frigid waters of the Baltic Sea.Adams, A. (1995, ). Sweden's vasa museum, an overwhelming sight: Final edition. The Record Under the orders of King Gustavus II Adolphus, the immense vessel was built to support Swedish military campaigns during the Thirty Years' War, yet was toppled by swift winds at sea. The Vasa remained peacefully underwater until a team of archaeologists raised the wreck in 1961. Fortunately, the wreck and all of its belongings were salvaged, despite its lengthily time spent on the ocean floor. Today, the Swedish Vasa museum in Stockholm is an emblem of cultural heritage, dedicated to educating public citizens worldwide.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.p.5 The discovery of the ship, and other sunken wrecks, may have also raised questions about the legal framework of the UNESCO Convention on the Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage. Pirating and looting As early as the sixth century BC, as Rome gained control over the Greek colonies of Italy and aligned itself with the western states, it developed a fleet that would allow the state to become the most powerful naval entity. Due to the lawless waters along the eastern coasts of Italy, this area was prevalent in pirating. Modern scholars refer to this area as being \\"inhabited by wild, uncivilized tribes, who were active marauders of the land and sea, and were constantly reinforced from the interior\\".Heller-Roazen, Daniel. The Enemy of All: Piracy and the Law of Nations. New York: Zone Books, 2009. p. 49 While many dispute the accounts of these events, the marauding nature of pirates may continue to remain true today. Although naval warfare has decreased in popularity, modern pirates are now turning to alternatives to attain their desired treasures. Today, it is estimated that three million undiscovered shipwrecks and ruins continue to lie at the bottom of the oceans. With the introduction and growing popularity of scuba-diving since the 1940s, the accessibility of such underwater cultural heritage sites are becoming easier to modern pirates in search of new treasure. Studies have already shown that as of 1974, all known shipwrecks off the coasts of Turkey have been exploited by underwater pirates. Additionally, Israeli archaeologists estimate that at least 60 per cent of cultural objects that once lay in wrecks and sites have now disappeared without any trace. Due to the sheer mass of the world's oceans and the inability to monitor all activity that takes place therein, pirates and underwater thieves continue to pose a significant threat to the preservation of cultural heritage and cultural property. In 2006, the UNESCO Convention was ratified by an additional state, Portugal, needing international protection for the looting of its underwater cultural heritage sites. At least six international treasure hunting organizations had established themselves off the coasts of Portugal to reap the benefits of the nation's coastline after new legislation had allowed for the sale of artifacts collected underwater during archaeological excavations in 1993. Due to this, physical goods may have been looted without proper care, damaging the cultural property that was left behind. Not only did Portugal face a loss of cultural goods, but also possible facts about its historical events. Today, Portugal is one of the nations that is protected by the body of the UNESCO Convention, wherein the commercial exploitation and dispersion are legally banned, and underwater archeological sites and wrecks are preserved for the future. Criticisms Abstaining from signing the 2001 UN Convention, the United States has stipulated that the term \\"all traces of human existence\\" is too broad, legally and as a mechanism tool for the protection of underwater cultural heritage for the preservation of future generations.Forrest, C. J. S. (2002). \\"Defining 'underwater cultural heritage'\\". The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology, 31(1), 3–11. doi:10.1006/ijna.2002.1022 p. 9 The United Kingdom also holds this concern. The UNESCO Convention has also been criticised by some States for seemingly eroding the sovereign immunity principle and for being incompatible with UNCLOS provisions, despite evidence to the contrary. A criticism of the UNCLOS articles is that they are considered ambiguous and obscure in nature. Article 149 fails to specify the manner in which objects of an archaeological nature are to be preserved of and disposed, as well as which mechanisms should be instituted in their conservation so as to benefit all current and future generations With the discovery of the Spanish galleon San José by the Colombian Government, and in an effort to claim the galleon with all its cargo, the Spanish Government tried to use the convention as a measure to stop Colombia from salvaging the ship. Article 13 recognises sovereign immunity over sunken warships, but Colombia is not a participating member of the Convention. Separately, Colombia has called the galleon part of its submerged patrimony so it is constitutionally bound to protect and preserve the warship.

It started in 1964 with Hajir Darioush's second film Serpent's Skin (جلد مار), which was based on D.H. Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover featuring Fakhri Khorvash and Jamshid Mashayekhi. Darioush's two important early social documentaries But Problems Arose (ولی افتاد مشکلها) in 1965, dealing with the cultural alienation of the Iranian youth, and Face 75 (چهره 75), a critical look at the westernization of the rural culture, which was a prizewinner at the 1965 Berlin Film Festival, also contributed significantly to the establishment of the New Wave. In 1968, after the release of Shohare Ahoo Khanoom directed by Davoud Mollapour, The Cow (گاو) directed by Darius Mehrjui followed by Masoud Kimiai's Qeysar (قیصر) in 1969, Nasser Taqvai's Tranquility in the Presence of Others (آرامش در حضور دیگران) (banned in 1969 and re-release in 1972), and immediately followed by Bahram Beyzai's Downpour, the New Wave became well established as a prominent cultural, dynamic and intellectual trend. The Iranian viewer became discriminating, encouraging the new trend to prosper and develop.Al-Ahram Weekly  People  Limelight  History = Early Iranian cinema  Cinema in Iran began to develop in 1900, when Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar was introduced to the cinematograph upon traveling to France. He ordered his chief photographer, Mirza Ibrahim Khan Akasbashi, to buy one. Visiting the Festival of Flowers in Belgium, Akasbashi turned the cinematograph toward the flower- adorned carriages, making him the first Iranian to ever film anything. Theaters were opened beginning in 1903 by Mirza Ibrahim Sahfbashi. The first film school was opened in 1930 by Russian-Armenian immigrant Ovanes Ohanian, who had studied at The School of Cinematic Art in Moscow. He started his first cinema school 1924 after arriving in Calcutta, India: after facing many difficulties he decided to move to Iran to start the first cinema school in Tehran where he created the first full-length Iranian silent film called Haji Agha and his second movie Abi va Rabi. After traveling to India in 1927, Abdul-Hussein Sepanta was inspired to make Persian language films, of which he ended up making four. Due to domination of the Pahlavi regime over all aspects of culture and the economy, as well as its very harsh censorship of films from 1925 to 1979, the cinema had difficulty developing in a way that reflected its own culture. In this time, Film Farsi began which has been described as “low- quality movies for audiences who were becoming addicted to such fare, losing any taste or demand for anything different.” Film Farsi is characterized by its mimicking of the popular cinemas of Hollywood and India, and its common use of song and dance routines. Forough Farrokhzad made the short documentary film The House Is Black in 1963, and this film is considered to be a precursor to the new wave cinema. Its unflinching depictions of life in a leper colony, paired with artistically composed shots and her own poetry, made this a truly unique film. Other films such as Farrokh Ghaffari's The Night of the Hunchback (1964), Ebrahim Golestan's Brick and Mirror (1965), and Fereydoun Rahnema's Siavush in Persepolis are all considered to be precursors as well.  First Wave  The first wave of Iranian new wave cinema came about as a reaction to the popular cinema at the time that did not reflect the norms of life for Iranians or the artistic taste of the society. It began in 1969 and then ended with the beginning of the Iranian revolution in 1979. The films produced were original, artistic and political. The first films considered to be part of this movement are Davoud Mollapour’s Shohare Ahoo Khanoom (1968), Masoud Kimiai's Qeysar and Darius Mehrjui's The Cow (1969). Other films considered to be part of this movement are Nasser Taghvai's Tranquility in the Presence of Others (1969/1972) which was banned and then heavily censored upon its release, Bahram Beyzai's Downpour, and Sohrab Shahid Saless's A Simple Event (1973) and Still Life (1974).  Second and Third Wave  The pioneers of the Iranian New Wave were directors like Hajir Darioush, Dariush Mehrjui, Masoud Kimiai, Nasser Taqvai, Ebrahim Golestan, Sohrab Shahid Saless, Bahram Beizai, and Parviz Kimiavi, who made innovative art films with highly political and philosophical tones and poetic language. Subsequent films of this type have become known as the New Iranian cinema to distinguish them from their earlier roots. The most notable figures of the Second Wave (after Islamic Revolution) are Amir Naderi, Abbas Kiarostami, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, Jafar Panahi, Majid Majidi & Asghar Farhadi . The factors leading to the rise of the New Wave in Iran were, in part, due to the intellectual and political movements of the time. A romantic climate was developing after the 19 August 1953 coup in the sphere of arts. Alongside this, a socially committed literature took shape in the 1950s and reached a peak in the 1960s, which many consider the golden era of contemporary Persian literature.The New Wave in Iranian Cinema - From Past to Present Iranian New Wave films shared some characteristics with the European art films of the period, in particular Italian Neorealism. However, in her article 'Real Fictions', Rose Issa argues that Iranian films have a distinctively Iranian cinematic language \\"that champions the poetry in everyday life and the ordinary person by blurring the boundaries between fiction and reality, feature film with documentary.\\" She also argues that this unique approach has inspired European cinema directors to emulate this style, citing Michael Winterbottom's award-winning In This World (2002) as an homage to contemporary Iranian cinema. Issa claims that \\"This new, humanistic aesthetic language, determined by the film-makers' individual and national identity, rather than the forces of globalism, has a strong creative dialogue not only on homeground but with audiences around the world.\\"Real Fictions Moreover, Iranian new wave films are rich in poetry and painterly images. There is a line back from modern Iranian cinema to the ancient oral Persian storytellers and poets, via the poems of Omar Khayyam.Steve Nottingham: Iranian Cinema Features of New Wave Iranian film, in particular the works of legendary Abbas Kiarostami, have been classified by some as postmodern.Abbas Kiarostami? The Truth Behind Reality In Close Up: Iranian Cinema, Past, Present, Future (2001), Hamid Dabashi describes modern Iranian cinema and the phenomenon of [Iranian] national cinema as a form of cultural modernity.

He was County Surveyor in County Fermanagh from 1900 until his retirement in 1940. Burkitt was a keen amateur ornithologist and studied European robins in the garden of his home (called Lawnakilla) near Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland. He started ringing the birds in October 1922, and his research, which was published in the journal British Birds between 1924 and 1926, was one of the first studies of bird behaviour and territory to use rings that enabled individual birds to be identified in the field. Later, at Laragh, Ballinamallard, County Fermanagh, Burkitt proved the longevity of one female robin. He had ringed this bird on 18 December 1927 and trapped her again on 14 July 1938—this robin was at least 11 years old, \\"the oldest living robin in the world\\". Burkitt's work was greatly admired by David Lack, who carried out further research on robins in the 1930s and 1940s. Burkitt's elder son was the surgeon Denis Parsons Burkitt FRS (1911-1993), for whom Burkitt's lymphoma is named. James Burkitt was born on 20 August 1870, at Killybegs, Co. Donegal, third son of Thomas Henry Burkitt, Presbyterian minister, and his wife Emma Eliza, née Parsons. Education and career James Burkitt was educated at Galway Grammar School, and at Queen's College, Galway (then part of the Royal University of Ireland), obtaining the degrees of BA in mathematics (1891) and BE (1892) with first-class honours. He then became an assistant to James Perry in Galway, during which period he superintended the underpinning of a large bridge and the erection of a pier and swing bridge over and estuary of the sea. In May 1893 he became assistant engineer to - Fisher on the Westport & Mulranny extension of the Midland Great Western railway, and in February 1894 to the partnership of Fisher & Le Fanu in the construction of the Collooney & Claremorris railway. On the completion of the latter, he continued to work for Fisher & Le Fanu on the Belfast waterworks. In 1897 he was employed on the Downpatrick waterworks under Peter Chalmers Cowan. He appears to have moved briefly to Co. Donegal before being appointed county surveyor for Co. Fermanagh at the end of 1898 in succession to Frederick Richard Thomas Willson. He held the Co. Fermanagh surveyorship for over forty years. Responsible for extensive road improvements in the county and for the introduction of tarmacadam road surfaces in 1904, he also built several bridges during the 1920s and 1930s. He retired in April 1940.(1) It was a few years after he had settled in Fermanagh, when he was thirty-seven, that Burkitt started to develop an interest in birds. Through his work on the methodology of plotting bird distribution, he became one of Ireland's most influential ornithologists; he also made contributions to the understanding of threat display and territorial behaviour and song, and was the first person to use ringing returns to estimate average age. Burkitt died on 30 March 1959 at Ballinamallard, Co. Fermanagh, and was buried in Trory churchyard. He was married to Glendoline, a daughter of William Henry Hill of Cork.

It is powered by a dual thrust rocket motor, which accelerates the missile to its cruising speed in 0.8 seconds. Operational use The missile is launched from an open framed launcher at an angle of 15 degrees. The operator steers the missile using a control box, which sends commands down a wire that is trailed from the missile. A gyroscope in the missile compensates for pitch and yaw. The Type 64 is typically operated by a three-man crew. It can also be deployed from a Mitsubishi Type 73 Jeep, which can carry four missiles and a Type 60 Armoured Personnel Carrier.

Limoux wine is produced under four Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) designations: Blanquette de Limoux, Blanquette méthode ancestrale, Crémant de Limoux and Limoux, the first three of which are sparkling wines and dominate the production around Limoux. The main grape of the region is the Mauzac, locally known as Blanquette, followed by Chardonnay and Chenin blanc. In 2005, the Limoux AOC was created to include red wine production consisting of mostly Merlot.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 402-403 Oxford University Press 2006 Wine historians believe that the world's first sparkling wine was produced in this region in 1531, by the monks at the abbey in Saint-Hilaire.E. McCarthy & M. Ewing-Mulligan \\"French Wine for Dummies\\" pg 222 Wiley Publishing 2001 Climate and geography The Limoux wine region is located in the eastern foothills of the Pyrénées in southern France, south of the fortified city of Carcassonne. The classified vineyards are all in the Aude département, in the general vicinity of Limoux, west of the Corbières hills. The climate is dominated by the strong winds of the region, the dry, Atlantic vent cers and the warm, Mediterranean vent marin. The Mediterranean climate of the region has more Atlantic influences than other Languedoc wine regions. The soil in the area is rocky with clay, sandstone and limestone, creating distinct terroir throughout the region depending on the degree of Mediterranean or Atlantic influences and clay composition in the soil.K. Marcus \\"A New Chardonnay Star on the Rise\\" Wine Spectator, October 31st, 2006 The unique topography of the region and combination of Mediterranean and Atlantic influences has created ideal conditions for the slow, even ripening of the region's white wine grapes. Despite being located at a southerly latitude, the climate is cooler and moister than in most of the wine regions in southern France. Its location in the foothills of the Pyrénées allows the vineyards to be at a higher elevation, and planted in optimal locations on hillsides. History The Limoux area describes itself as the oldest sparkling wine area of the world. This Crémant de Limoux has been named after the year the first sparkling wines were mentioned – 1531. Records show that Livy traded in non- sparkling white wines from Limoux as far back as the Roman occupation of the region. Blanquette de Limoux is considered to be the first sparkling white wine produced in France, created long before the Champagne region became world-renowned for the sparkling wine Champagne. The first textual mention of \\"blanquette\\", from the Occitan expression for \\"the small white\\", appeared in 1531 in papers written by Benedictine monks at an abbey in Saint-Hilaire. They detail the production and distribution of Saint-Hilaire's blanquette in cork- stoppered flasks. The region's location, north of the Cork Oak forest of Catalunya, gave Limoux producers easy access to the material needed to produce secondary fermentation in the flask, which produces the bubbles necessary for sparkling wine. Local lore suggests that Dom Pérignon learned how to produce sparkling white wine while serving in this abbey before moving to the Champagne region and popularizing the drink,K. Marcus Limoux: White Wines Take the Lead Wine Spectator, August 19th, 2003 but this is almost certain to be false since Dom Pérignon was involved with improving Champagne's still wines, and not the sparkling ones. In 1938, Blanquette de Limoux became one of the first AOCs established in the Languedoc region (1936 AOCs included Muscat de Frontignan in the Languedoc and Rivesaltes, Maury, and Banyuls in the Roussillon). While the classification is recent, the wine itself has long been a traditional apéritif or dessert accompaniment in the area. In recent decades, appellation rules have been relaxed to allow an increased use of international grape varieties, which have partially replaced Mauzac. Grapes Limoux Vineyard The main grape of the Limoux region is the Mauzac grape, which produces a rustic wine with a characteristic apple-peel flavor that can be reminiscent of sweet apple cider. The grape is declining in worldwide plantings, with Southwest France being one of the few places where Mauzac has a lasting presence. The use of Chardonnay and Chenin blanc is growing, due in part to the more internationally recognized flavors of both grapes. The 1980s saw an increase in the plantings and popularity of Chardonnay. Limoux winemakers began developing a unique style of still wines made from Chardonnay and fermented in oak barrels that were sold as Vin de pays. The reputation of these Chardonnay wines grew to where they are regarded as some of the best examples of French Chardonnay outside of Burgundy.Wine News French Grant Limoux AOC Status for Chardonnay Wine Spectator, October 15, 1994 Barrel samplings were featured at the yearly Toques et Clochers charity auction that was modeled after the famous Hospices de Beaune. Prices of these Vins de pays soon exceeded what the French authorities thought was appropriate for this low classification and in 1993, the Limoux AOC was revised to include the still wines made from Chardonnay. While made mostly of Chardonnay, these wines are permitted to include Chenin blanc and must include a minimum of 15% Mauzac. The red wines of the Limoux AOC are composed of at least 50% Merlot with Carignan, Grenache, Malbec (known locally as Côt) and Syrah making up at least 30% of the blend. Carignan itself is limited to a maximum of 10% as a component from the 2010 vintage. Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc are also grown in the area and are restricted to a maximum of 20% together in red Limoux AOC wines. They are however also used in the Vin de pays wines sold as Vin de pays de la Haute Vallée de l'Aude. Blanquette de Limoux The name Blanquette de Limoux has been used for a long time for the sparkling wines from Limoux. \\"Blanquette\\" actually just means \\"small white\\" in the local Occitan language. Blanquette de Limoux can contain three grape varieties: Mauzac (which must constitute a minimum of 90% of the wine), Chardonnay, and Chenin blanc. Prior to the 1990 introduction of the Crémant de Limoux AOC, the use of Mauzac was optional. The change to the mandatory minimum of 90% Mauzac in the AOC regulations of Blanquette de Limoux was seen as a safeguard in maintaining the traditional style of Blanquette de Limoux and preserving the use of the local Mauzac grape which is declining in worldwide plantings. The taste of this Mauzac based wine is unique, with apple flavors and distinctive aromas of fresh cut grass that can be identified in blind tastings. Wine writer Tom Stevenson notes a change in the profile of recent vintage with wines that are \\"developing finer, more flowery, autolytic aromas.\\"T. Stevenson \\"The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia\\" pg 237-241 Dorling Kindersley 2005 The grape varieties are vinified separately before being assembled and bottled. Just before bottling, a tirage is added to the blend so that a second fermentation will take place in the bottle. The carbon dioxide produced during this second fermentation is trapped in the bottle and gives the wine its effervescence. After nine months, the bottles are opened and disgorged before a final corking.Karen MacNeil, The Wine Bible pg 302 Workman Publishing 2001 Blanquette méthode ancestrale The wine that the monks of St-Hilaire invented in 1531 was known as Vin de Blanquette and the méthode rurale wine became a separate AOC known as Blanquette méthode ancestrale. Today this AOC is used for a sweetish sparkling wine made in a more old-fashioned way, without disgorgement. It is produced in the same area as Blanquette de Limoux, and may only contain Mauzac. Due to the absence of disgorgement, these wines are generally very cloudy with particles of the sediment of dead yeast cells, known as lees, still present in the wine. The winemaking method used to make Blanquette méthode ancestrale is also known as the méthode gaillacoise and is used to make the sparkling Mousseux wine of the Gaillac AOC. This method involves traditional hand crafted winemaking, with minimum use of modern technology such as stainless steel fermentation tanks. The resulting wines are typically low in alcohol (often less than 7% by volume), with sweet apple-like flavors and a slight sparkling fizz. Bottling of this wine traditionally occurred on a day of astrological significance. Crémant de Limoux Winemaking cooperative Sieur d'Arques, the largest winery in Limoux When the term Crémant was introduced for non-Champagne sparkling wines in France, an AOC for more \\"modern\\" or internationally styled sparkling wines, was created in 1990. The origin of that decision occurred a year earlier, in 1989, when the producers of Limoux had to decide whether or not they wanted to maintain the traditional makings of Blanquette de Limoux based on Mauzac or relax the AOC regulations to allow the introduction of more Chenin blanc and Chardonnay to create internationally recognized flavors. Limoux producers were split on what direction they wanted to go, so the provisional appellation of Crémant de Limoux was introduced to allow the producers to make whichever style of sparkling wine that they preferred and still sell it under an AOC designation. A deadline was set in 1994 for the least used AOC designation to be phased out but the deadline passed without Crémant de Limoux or Blanquette de Limoux making significant progress and both AOC continue to co-exist today. These Crémant de Limoux wines differ primarily from Blanquette de Limoux in their grape composition with Chardonnay and Chenin blanc as the main varieties. Together they are not to exceed 90% of the wines. For Chenin blanc, a minimum of 20% and a maximum of 40% must be used. Mauzac and Pinot noir are accessory grape varieties and may not exceed 20% together with Pinot noir itself not exceeding 10%. Thus, Crémant de Limoux contains 40-70% Chardonnay, 20-40% Chenin blanc, 0-20% Mauzac and 0-10% Pinot noir. AOC regulations dictate that the wine be aged for a least a year on the lees prior to disgorgement. Over 40 villages around the city of Limoux are permitted to make Crémant de Limoux. Limoux Prior to 1993, the only non-sparkling still wine that Limoux producers could make under an AOC designation was Mauzac. The growing popularity and high prices of Vin de pays still wines made from Chardonnays prompted the French authorities to revise the Limoux appellation. Varietal versions of Chardonnay and Chenin blanc were permitted but all white wines were required to contain a minimum 15% of Mauzac. European Union regulations dictate that a varietal wine must contain at least 85% of the variety listed on the wine label so most Limoux AOC white wines are typically two grape blends-85% of the main variety, like Chardonnay, and 15% Mauzac. Producers that wished to make a 100% Chardonnay wine, or one without Mauzac, have to produce their wines as Vin de Pays d'Oc with E & J Gallo Winery's Red Bicyclette being one of the more notable examples being made primarily with Chardonnay grapes from the Limoux region. The Limoux AOC was the first AOC to regulate mandatory barrel fermentation for its white wine. The appellation was approved for the production of red varietal wines starting with the 2003 vintage. These wines must contain a minimum of 50% Merlot with Grenache, Malbec and Syrah. Carignan is permitted at a maximum of 10% of the blend until 2010 when the variety is expected to be phased out completely of Limoux production. All together there must be at least 3 grape varieties in the blend with no two single varieties exceeding 90% of the total blend. In recent years, the Limoux AOC has seen significant investment by negociants, cooperatives and larger French wine estates, like Baroness Philippine de Rothschild of Château Mouton Rothschild, who see potential in the red wines from this traditionally sparkling white wine region. Grape composition The AOC specifies the following rules for the varietal composition for Limoux AOC wine:INAO: Appelation rules for AOC Limoux, updated until February 25, 2005 * White wine can be made from Mauzac, Chardonnay and Chenin blanc, with a minimum of 15% Mauzac. * Red wine can be made from Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Grenache, Malbec (under the name Cot), Syrah and Carignan. The wine must be a blend containing a minimum of three varieties, with no two varieties together exceeding 90% of the blend. Furthermore, Merlot must make up a minimum of 50%, Grenache, Malbec, Syrah and Carignan must together make up a minimum of 30%. However, from the 2010 harvest, Carignan may not exceed 10%. Wine styles The white still wines of the Limoux AOC vary depending on the primary grape. Mauzac adds a zesty acidity and requires time in the bottle before some of the more subtle, floral flavors emerge. Wines that are dominated by Chardonnay are more approachable in their youth and are tend to have a rich, full body with lemon and oak flavors.

Repertoire Days In preparation of the solo-percussion competition, TROMP International Percussion Competition Eindhoven organised masterclasses around the globe. Participants were given the opportunity to study and perform the repertoire for the TROMP Competition with renowned percussionists. The Repertoire Days took place in Boston - U.S.A. (2nd until 5 March), Shanghai - China (6th until 10 March) and Amsterdam - The Netherlands (15 until 18 March). TROMP Percussion Eindhoven managed to assemble the following percussionists for the TROMP Repertoire Days 2012: Boston  Boston Conservatory  Arnold Marinissen (set-up -> Rebonds)  Emmanuel Séjourné (vibraphone)  Nancy Zeltsman (preparing competition) Shanghai  Shanghai Conservatory  Arnold Marinissen (set-up -> Rebonds)  Emmanuel Séjourné (vibraphone)  Yi-Ping Yang (timpani / preparing competition) Amsterdam  Conservatorium van Amsterdam  Peter Prommel (marimba)  Benoit Cambreling (Timpani)  Andrei Pushkarev (vibraphone)  Claire Edwardes (marimba / preparing competition) The jury Pedro Estevan (Spain) Jean Geoffroy (France) Pete Lockett (United Kingdom) Momoko Kamiya (Japan) Arnold Marinissen (The Netherlands) Zoltan Rácz (Hungary) Nancy Zeltsman (United States of America) Non-voting chairman of the Jury: Lucas Vis (The Netherlands) The Commission The Commission An important component of TROMP Percussion Eindhoven is the commissioned composition, written by a prominent composer. During previous editions, composers such as Louis Andriessen (2000), Jacob ter Veldhuis (2006), Steve Martland (2008) and Michael Torke (2010) have created the special TROMP composition. The American composer Nico Muhly will now follow in their footsteps. Nico Muhly was given the task of composing the compulsory work, which will be performed for the first time during the final by the contestants together with Colin Currie and Britten Sinfonia, directed by Bas Wiegers. A second commission has been given to budding Dutch composer Joey Roukens. He will write the compulsory work for timpani to be performed during the finals. Nico Muhly - Double Standard American composer Nico Muhly (1981) is already one of the most popular composers in the world. Premières of his orchestral pieces have already been performed by the Boston Pops Orchestra, the New York Philharmonic and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Muhly has also written various film scores, including Joshua (2007) and ‘Best Film’ nominated The Reader (2008). As a performing artist he works as arranger and conductor with numerous other renowned artists, including Philip Glass, Antony and the Johnsons, Björk, Rufus Wainwright, Grizzly Bear and Sufjan Stevens. During season 12/13, Nico Muhly is composer in residence of Muziekgebouw Eindhoven for the fourth consecutive year. Joey Roukens - Beat Mutations Rising star Joey Roukens (1982) can easily be described as the forerunner of the next generation of Dutch composers. In recent years he has been commissioned to write pieces by the Koninklijk Concertgebouworkest, AskoSchönberg, the Storioni Festival and violinist Janine Jansen. Colin Currie performed the première of Roukens’ Percussion Concerto in May 2011. Currie heralded the piece as ‘one of the five best concertos ever written’.

The storm dumped rain, sleet, and snow from Maryland to Maine leaving hundreds of thousands without power and as much as three feet of snow on the ground. Due to the date many people took warnings of the storm less than seriously. Plows had already begun to be put away for the summer and hardware stores had to sell shovels again even though they already had out patio furniture. One commuter called it \\"Mother Nature's April Fools' Joke.\\" Life of the storm=Formation The storm started as a surface low pressure system over the Ohio River Valley that was generated by an area of strong jet stream energy carving out an active upper air low pressure trough on Sunday March 30. The low pressure system brought rain to much of the Ohio Valley. When the storm arrived in eastern New York and western New England the areas received light rain. The storm moved off the coast of New Jersey on March 31 and began rapidly strengthening. As the storm intensified, air began rising around the storm at a very rapid rate which cooled in the atmosphere and caused the rain to change into heavy snow. The low moved very slowly along the coast gaining strength throughout the day, and with a continuous supply of moisture, this allowed for an extended period of heavy snow. Boston Prior to the storm, Boston had received just of snow for the season. On Sunday March 30, Boston was sunny with a high temperature of . A cold front passed early next day (Monday March 31), dropping the temperature into the 40s, and just prior to dawn precipitation began to fall in the form of light rain. In Boston the rain began to mix with wet snow mid-morning and eventually turned to wet snow and became heavier just after 7 p.m. From 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. the snow fell at a rate of at least per hour. During the peak of the storm from about 11 p.m. March 31 to 3 a.m. April 1, snow fell in Boston at the rate of per hour. Numerous lightning strikes and thunderclaps accompanied the extremely heavy snow, which accumulated in just that four-hour period. Moderate to heavy snow continued through midmorning before tapering off. Impact=New EnglandPrecipitation received= The of snow that fell at Boston's Logan International Airport was the fourth-biggest snowstorm in Boston history, behind the North American blizzard of 2003's , the Northeastern United States blizzard of 1978's , and the February 1969 nor'easter's . The storm was the biggest on record in the month of April and made April 1997 Boston's snowiest April on record, nearly doubling the previous record of . It also set a record for Boston's greatest April 24-hour snowfall. Parts of New England received wind gusts at the height of the storm. Providence recorded of snow which was the fourth greatest on record at the time. Other parts of New England reported more than and up to three feet with Worcester receiving , the city's largest snowfall in history until 2015. =Damage and travel disruptions= A state of emergency was declared by Massachusetts Gov. William F. Weld. The snow came down too fast for road crews to keep up with and roads became impassable and thousands of cars were stranded. Commuter trolleys in Boston were closed for the first time in nearly twenty years, public transportation was crippled, about 1,000 motorists spent the night stranded in their cars and 4,000 stayed in shelters. Some of the narrow side streets of Boston were completely buried and portions of Interstate 95 and Route 128 were shut down because of the snow. The main roads and highways were cleared within a couple of days but the secondary roads remained a mess making travel difficult. Two days after the storm, subways and commuter rails were still sluggish because of fallen trees and signal problems. The wet and heavy snow caused tree limbs and even whole trees to fall. Some fell on power lines, and many people were left without power. Electricity was knocked out for nearly 700,000 people. Nearly 13% of New England lost power, mainly due to trees falling on power lines and utility poles. Power crews from as far away as Canada came to help clean up the area. Logan Airport was also shut down from 2 p.m. March 31 to 10 p.m. April 1. Mid-Atlantic Upstate New York received and in some parts of New Jersey two feet of snow fell causing delays on commuter trains. A disaster was declared in eight northeast counties by Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge and the National Guard of the United States was dispatched to dig out cars. Interstate 84 had to be shut down because of a ten vehicle accident. Injuries and deaths Hospitals reported weather-related injuries including back sprains, pedestrians being hit by falling ice, and hand injuries including missing fingers from snow blowers. Three deaths were caused by the storm in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, all men who had heart attacks while shoveling, with another traffic death in New York which may have been caused by the weather.

Origin Although artists have been mixing reggae with other genres from as early as the early 1970s, no official term had been used to describe this practice. Artists such as UB40 were described using terms that joined the various genres they performed (e.g. \\"reggae funk\\", \\"reggae pop\\", \\"reggae-disco\\"). It was not until the late 1990s when the term was coined. The subgenre predominantly evolved from late 1980s and early 1990s dancehall music which instrumentals or \\"riddims\\" contained elements from the R&B; and hip hop genres. Due to this, some consider dancehall artists such as Mad Cobra, Shabba Ranks, Super Cat, Buju Banton and Tony Rebel as pioneers of reggae fusion. For some of these artists, such as Buju Banton, reggae fusion became a staple throughout their careers. However, reggae fusion can be traced back to before the success of these artists, as far back as the late 1970s and early 1980s, where songs such as \\"Pass the Dutchie\\" and the band Third World blazed the trail finding international success with songs such as \\"Now That We Found Love\\" and \\"Try Jah Love\\". Therefore, Third World can be seen as arguably the original pioneers of reggae fusion leading the way for groups such as UB40 and Steel Pulse. Although there were a few recognized reggae fusion artists in the late '80s to mid-1990s, such as the aforementioned acts in addition to others such as Sublime, Maxi Priest, Shinehead, 311, First Light, The Police and Inner Circle, their style of fusing genres was subtly done. Artists such as Diana King, Patra, Buju Banton, Ini Kamoze, Snow and Shabba Ranks followed in their footsteps, however, creating a less subtle fusion by further blending heavier Jamaican dialect as well as more hardcore and sexual lyrics in their songs. This led to a lot of crossover success for these artists with songs such as \\"Informer\\" and \\"Here Comes the Hotstepper\\" reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100 as well as topping charts all around the world. As the subgenre began to take shape, the mid to late 1990s saw artists becoming more innovative as many began to mix genres that were not similar nor typically associated with reggae, such as techno and house, leading to the subgenre gaining a more distinctive following and really beginning to grow. Ironically, however, a major contributing factor to the subgenre garnering further international prominence was due to the lack of marketability of dancehall, especially in its rawest form, in the United States. By the late 1990s, dancehall had lost its footing in the American market as while initially an appreciated novelty, it had gotten too hardcore lyrically and started using even heavier Jamaican dialect and less standard English making it harder to understand what was being said. It had also come under heavy criticism from the international markets due to the homophobic lyrical content which sought to bash, condemn and instigate violence against the act as well as those who supported or participated in the lifestyle. This led dancehall artists who were trying to break into the U.S. market, to fuse the dancehall style of toasting or deejaying over softer and predominantly pop and hip hop instrumentals as well as to diversify the content of their songs while moving away from homophobic lyrics. Traditional dancehall acts, such as Shaggy and Beenie Man experienced commercial success in the American markets with the release of their albums in 2000. Shaggy had previously experienced multiple chart successes in the '90s but it was his album, Hot Shot, that especially helped further propel the subgenre internationally, as his album spawned two #1 singles on the Billboard Hot 100, \\"It Wasn't Me\\" and \\"Angel\\". No Doubt's 2002 massive hit album Rock Steady, with worldwide reggae fusion hits such as \\"Underneath it All\\" featuring Lady Saw and \\"Hey Baby\\" featuring Bounty Killer, further propelled the subgenre's popularity to new heights. This was especially because it marked one of the first times a pop/ska punk act had made a complete reggae fusion album since the mid-'90s and opened up the genre to a new fan base as reggae fusion was, at that point, mainly utilized by reggae artists trying to break into the mainstream market and not by already established acts, such as No Doubt. The early 2000s also saw Sean Paul achieve tremendous success internationally with singles such as \\"Baby Boy\\", \\"Breathe\\", \\"Like Glue\\" and \\"Make It Clap\\", among many others. His albums Dutty Rock and The Trinity altogether spawned five top 10 Billboard Hot 100 hits between 2002 and 2006, including the number one hits \\"Get Busy\\" and \\"Temperature\\". Euro reggae In the early 1990s, the evolution of reggae fusion reached another musical style in Europe with the worldwide #1 hits \\"All That She Wants\\", \\"The Sign\\" and \\"Don't Turn Around\\" by Ace of Base. The sound was often called Euro reggae and became a trend of Eurodance music, including Mr. President's hit \\"Coco Jamboo\\", \\"Sweet Sweet Smile\\" by Tatjana, E-Rotic's \\"Help Me Dr. Dick\\", \\"Ole Ole Singin' Ole Ola\\" by Rollergirl, \\"Bamboleo\\" by Garcia, \\"Sex on the Beach\\" by T-Spoon and \\"We're Going to Ibiza\\" by the Vengaboys. Eurodance artists such as Dr. Alban, E-Rotic and the Vengaboys also regularly fused their style with reggae. Growth in Jamaica The first reggae fusion- influenced riddim was produced in 2005 by Cordell \\"Skatta\\" Burrell, which featured deejays on a techno-based instrumental. Reggae fusion is now a regular staple on Jamaican radio stations, especially Zip 103 FM, in the form of singles, mixes and remixes. This has led to more reggae fusion hits being produced as well as making strong waves on the dancehall charts in Jamaica. One such single, \\"Ramping Shop\\" (using the same instrumental of Ne-Yo's \\"Miss Independent\\") by Vybz Kartel and Spice, was one of the biggest reggae fusion hits in 2008, not to mention one of the top singles in Jamaica of that year, peaking at #1. Its continued exposure to Jamaicans became very evident in 2009, as the summer saw an explosion of Jamaican-produced reggae fusion riddims such as \\"Mood Swing\\" (which yielded the massive breakout #1 hit \\"Life\\" by G-Whizz) and hit tracks such as \\"Holiday\\" by Ding Dong and \\"(From Mawning) Never Change\\" by Chino. Both of these songs reached the top five on the Jamaican charts, with the former track peaking at number one in December 2009 and both (along with \\"Life\\") being nominated for \\"Song of the Year\\" at the 2010 EME Music Awards (Jamaican equivalent to the Grammy Awards), which was won by \\"Holiday\\". This marked the first time a reggae fusion song had won the prestigious award since the award show's conception in 2008 as well as the first time three reggae fusion songs were nominated for the award. \\"Holiday\\" was also nominated and won for the \\"Best Collaboration\\". Since 2010, reggae fusion has become a regular component of dancehall music and is as popular as it has ever been, being incorporated in many riddims such as the popular \\"One Day\\" riddim produced by Seanizzle. In 2011, Shaggy established a reggae fusion record label called Ranch Entertainment. It was intended to be launched in the summer of 2012. Local criticism and praise Its growth locally, however, has not come without its criticisms as some feel that the subgenre only serves to dilute the raw sound of reggae and their musical culture. This controversy was further heightened in 2012, during the Jamaica 50th anniversary campaign to celebrate the country's 50th year of independence, as two vastly different songs were recognized as 'Jamaica 50' campaign songs, one which was a reggae fusion song entitled \\"On a Mission\\" produced by Shaggy and the other a roots reggae song entitled \\"Find a Flag\\" written by Mikey Bennett. While \\"On a Mission\\" was recognized as the official anniversary song and was applauded by some, it received its fair share of negative feedback due to many questioning its inauthentic Jamaican sound. A popular dancehall artist, Mr. Vegas spoke out against the use of the song being quoted as saying \\"It doesn't represent Jamaica 50, it doesn't reflect our culture or where our music is coming from\\". In 2014, following the growth of dance music in Jamaica, legendary reggae musician Richie Stephens sought to capitalize on this by launching a new riddim called 'Skatech' which was an amalgamation of Jamaican ska and electronic dance music. Stephens believed that due to ska not being at the forefront of Jamaican music for many years, combining it with something fresh could bring it back into the spotlight. This provided a different and positive counterargument to the criticism of reggae fusion in Jamaican music, as it was here being used to bring the original forms of reggae back into the limelight, not to drown it out or dilute it as critics would posit. Drake was heavily criticized in 2016 from fans when it was realized that Popcaan's verse from \\"Controlla\\" was removed from the album version of Views, causing many to accuse him of cultural appropriation. Prior to the album's release, two tracks were leaked online, one of which was \\"Controlla\\" featuring Popcaan. When the album was released and it no longer featured Popcaan, many fans became irate. Popcaan, however, said he was happy for the exposure and understood that it was a business decision. Continued international popularity Through other Caribbean-born artists such as Sean Paul, Damian Marley, Sean Kingston, Nicki Minaj and Rihanna who emerged during the mid-2000s, the popularity of the subgenre has continued to grow. International reggae fusion hits, such as \\"Calabria 2007\\" by Enur feat. Natasja Saad, \\"Need U Bad\\" by Jazmine Sullivan, \\"Say Hey (I Love You)\\" by Michael Franti & Spearhead featuring Cherine Anderson and \\"Billionaire\\" by Travis McCoy, show that the subgenre has matured and is as popular as it has ever been, with more artists experimenting with it. Jamaican singer Tessanne Chin is one of the latest reggae fusion artists reaching international fame following her winning Season 5 of NBC's reality TV singing competition The Voice as part of Adam Levine's team. Later in 2014, Canadian reggae fusion band, Magic!, scored a worldwide number-one hit with their single \\"Rude\\". It was the beginning of a major resurgence of the genre as this was followed later in 2015 by another number one reggae fusion song when Jamaican artist OMI claimed the top spot with the Felix Jaehn remix to his song \\"Cheerleader\\". Sorry\\" by Justin Bieber, \\"Work\\" by Rihanna, \\"One Dance\\" by Drake, \\"Cheap Thrills\\" by Sia, \\"Locked Away\\" by R. City, \\"All in My Head (Flex)\\" by Fifth Harmony, and in 2017 starting with \\"Shape of You\\" by Ed Sheeran also became international hits between late 2015 and early 2017 with all except \\"Locked Away\\" and \\"All in My Head\\" topping the Billboard Hot 100. R. City are known primarily for their songwriting and production many of which include reggae fusion tracks such as \\"Take You There\\" and \\"Replay\\", which they helped co-write. Other producers have also gained recognition for consistently incorporating reggae fusion into songs they produce, such as Major Lazer and J. R. Rotem, who has produced reggae fusion hits such as \\"Beautiful Girls\\", \\"Me Love\\", \\"Take You There\\", \\"Replay\\" and \\"Solo\\". A new generation of musicians are largely to thank for the prominence of reggae fusion in the last few years. Dancehall music saw a decline on the international stage over the last decade but the genre is now seeing a resurgence back into the mainstream of music leading to many dancehall-inspired tracks. In 2016, a decade after Sean Paul's last triumph on the Billboard Hot 100, it was abundantly clear that larger audiences finally seemed receptive to this sound again. Coincidentally, Sean Paul, himself, seemed to reemerge as a popular featured act as he was called up for guest appearances with pop artistes such as Little Mix, Jay Sean, Enrique Iglesias, Sia, with his collaboration with the latter two, \\"Bailando\\" and \\"Cheap Thrills\\" respectively, becoming major international hits and \\"Cheap Thrills\\" becoming #1 on the Billboard Hot 100. Artists such as Meghan Trainor, Alicia Keys, Nico & Vinz, Calvin Harris, Ariana Grande, Twenty One Pilots, Clean Bandit and Britney Spears also made forays into the genre with songs \\"Better\\", \\"In Common\\", \\"Imagine\\", \\"My Way\\", \\"Side to Side\\", sleeper hit \\"Ride\\", \\"Rockabye\\" and \\"Slumber Party\\", respectively. Drake, however, has been an unlikely talisman of the genre beginning as early from his 2010 single, \\"Find Your Love\\" and culminating in his latest works, particularly his fourth mixtape If You're Reading This It's Too Late and his fourth studio album, Views, both of which feature heavy dancehall influences and popular dancehall acts such as Popcaan and reggae fusion singles, \\"One Dance\\", \\"Controlla\\" and \\"Too Good\\". Fellow Canadian act, Tory Lanez, whose parents are both from Caribbean islands, also had a major breakout in 2016 with \\"Luv\\", which sampled the late 90s dancehall classic \\"Everyone Falls in Love\\" by Tanto Metro and Devonte. With the use of the dancehall's signature tempo on the albums of major music players such as Drake, Rihanna, Justin Bieber, Kanye West and more, the genre has become so popular that Apple Music started their own dancehall inspired playlist. This level of popularity hasn’t been seen since Sean Paul followed in the path of Shaggy’s crossover success and opened the flood gates for some of the Caribbean’s brightest talents to find their way onto mainstream radio in the early 2000s. Other major pop artistes continued to venture into the Dancehall-pop genre in 2017 with Ed Sheeran, Katy Perry, and Calvin Harris, having hits with \\"Shape of You\\", \\"Chained to the Rhythm\\" and \\"Feels\\" respectively.

It has been a school and a training base for Polish soldiers who had arrived in Scotland after the 51st Highland Division had been forced to surrender at Saint-Valery-en-Caux in 1940. The building was the most expensive building in Britain ever reclaimed by a bank. History Mellville House was built in 1697 by the architect James Smith (c. 1645–1731) for George Melville, 1st Earl of Melville (1636–1707). The remains of the 14th-century Monimail Palace which the Melvilles had bought in 1592 were incorporated into the grounds as a folly. The estate once bordered the nearby royal estate of Falkland Palace which had been a popular retreat with all the Stuart monarchs who used the vast surrounding forests for hawking and hunting deer. Wild boar, was also imported from France and hunted in the area. Melville however was to be accused of being involved in the Rye House Plot — a Whig conspiracy to assassinate King Charles II and his brother the Duke of York (the future James VII). To escape arrest Melville fled to Holland where he joined the band of British Protestant exiles at the court of Prince William of Orange. Here Melville became one of the chief Scots supporters of William of Orange.The Final Crisis of the Stuart Monarchy: The Revolutions of 1688-91 in their British, Atlantic and European Contexts Tim Harris Stephen Taylor Series: Studies in Early Modern Cultural, Political and Social History Volume: 16 Copyright Date: 2013 Published by: Boydell & Brewer, Boydell Press During the 1940s the estate and house was used to billet Polish soldiers during World War II who were training for a guerilla campaign against any German invasion throughout the Blitz period. Scotland was seen as a prime target for an invasion by the Nazis via their bases in Norway, throughout 1940–1942\\"The British Resistance Movement, 1940–44\\". Geoffrey Bradford. Retrieved 11 June 2006. After the war the estate was purchased by Dalhousie Preparatory Boarding School, when they moved premises from Dalhousie Castle in Lothian. It remained a private preparatory school from 1950 to 1971. During the 1960s in non-school term time weeks Outward Bound utilised the school by hiring it as a Scottish residential centre for their worldwide and challenging outdoor adventure programs. Later Melville House became a special education boarding school from 1975 to 1998 with fees varying from pupil to pupil.Duffell, N. \\"The Making of Them. The British Attitude to Children and the Boarding School System\\". (London: Lone Arrow Press, 2000). In general, the education department would consider referrals of unique boys who displayed both academic potential and/or difficulty developing within mainstream education, and in several cases funded the fees. However, in other cases, some guardians were required to contribute toward said fees after completion of a financial assessment. In 1980 the board removed rugby and cricket from the curriculum, transforming the rugby pitches into football pitches. they converted the cricket pavilion into a canoe/boat house; with an emphasis upon utilizing the terrain of the East Neuk of Fife and the vast sandy beaches surrounding Tentsmuir Forest for outdoor pursuits. In 1981, a new standardised modular design system building was erected at considerable expense upon the old walled fruit garden. This was a one level permanent core building containing an indoor football area and gymnasium, an administration area, showers, locker rooms, library and a limited number of permanent classrooms in science, mathematics and computers.Humes, W.

In applying the complexity and paradoxes of mathematical logic to psychoanalysis, he pioneered a coherent way of understanding the clinical situation. He has an international following that includes: physicists, mathematicians, cyber-scientists, psychologists, mathematical philosophers, neuroscientists, theologians, linguistics and literary scholars.Iurato, Giuseppe. (2014) At the grounding of computational psychoanalysis: on the work of Ignacio Matte Blanco A general history of culture overview of Matte Blanco bilogic in comparison, https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01023409 Life Matte Blanco was born in Santiago (Chile). He was educated in Chile and qualified there as a medical doctor. He entered psychoanalysis with Fernando Allende Navarro, Latin America's first qualified psychoanalyst. Having moved to London in 1933, he trained in psychiatry at South London's Maudsley Hospital and in psychoanalysis at the British Psychoanalytical Society where he was supervised by Anna Freud and James Strachey, becoming a member of the British Society in 1938.\\"Matte-Blanco, Ignacio\\" He subsequently worked in the United States, from 1940. He returned to Chile in 1943 where he co-founded the Psychoanalytic Society. In 1966 he travelled to Italy, never to return to his homeland. He settled in Rome with his family. He died there at the age of 86. The unconscious Matte Blanco's hypothesis proposes that in the unconscious \\"a part can represent the whole\\" and that \\"past, present, and future are all the same\\"'.Patrick Casement, Further Learning from the Patient (London 1996), p. 76 He set out to examine the five characteristics of the unconscious that Freud had outlined: timelessness, displacement, condensation, replacement of external by internal reality, and absence of mutual contradiction.West, Marcus. Feeling, Being and the Sense of Self (London 2007) p. 103 Matte Blanco hypothesized the nature of unconscious logic, as opposed to conscious logic. He deduced that if the unconscious has consistent characteristics it must follow rules, or there would be chaos. However the nature of these hypothetical characteristics indicates that their rules differ from conventional logic. In his work The Unconscious as Infinite Sets, Matte Blanco proposes that the structure of the unconscious can be summarised by the principles of Generalisation and of Symmetry: 1) The principle of Generalization: here logic does not take account of individuals as such, it deals with them only as members of classes, and of classes of classes. 2) The principle of Symmetry: here the logic treats the converse of any relation as identical to it; that is, it deals with relationships as symmetrical'.Matte Blanco, I. (1975) The Unconscious as Infinite Sets. London: Karmac\\"Matte- Blanco, Ignacio\\" While the principle of Generalisation might be compatible with conventional logic, discontinuity is introduced by the principle of Symmetry under which relationships are treated as symmetrical, or reversible. Whereas asymmetrical thinking distinguishes individuals from one another by the relationship between them, reality testing, symmetrical thinking, by contrast, sees relations as holding indiscriminately across a field of individuals.Michael Parsons, The Dove that Returns, the Dove that Vanishes (London 2000) p. 49 For example, an asymmetrical relationship, X is greater than Y, becomes reversible so that Y is simultaneously greater and smaller than X. Matte Blanco draws here on Klein's understanding that \\"I am angry (with a person or thing)\\" as very close to \\"Someone or something is very angry with me\\";Josephine Klein, Our Need for Others (London, 1994) p. 141 and indeed he suggests that Klein was the most creative and original of all those who have drawn inspiration from Freud, highlighting in particular her famous concept of projective identification.Eric Rayner/David Tuckett, \\"An Introduction\\", Igancio Matte Blanco, Thinking, Feeling and Being (1988) p. 5 For Matte Blanco, \\"unconsciousness\\" is marked by symmetry, where there is a tendency towards 'sameness' and likewise, an implicit aversion to 'difference', while the quality of ego-functioning registers and bears difference, in a sense he called asymmetry .West, p. 103 The symmetrical and the asymmetrical Matte Blanco divided the unconscious into two modes of being: the symmetrical and the asymmetrical. Asymmetrical relations are relations that are non reversible. For example, “Jack reads the newspaper” cannot be reversed to the newspaper reading Jack. In this way, asymmetrical relations are logical relations and underlie everyday logic and common sense. They govern the conscious sphere of the human mind. Symmetrical relations, on the other hand, move in both directions simultaneously. For example, 'Daniel sits on a stone' can be reversed as, 'a stone sits on Daniel', without being untrue. Symmetrical relations, govern the unconscious mind. Matte Blanco states that the symmetrical, unconscious realm is the natural state of man and is a massive and infinite presence while the asymmetrical, conscious realm is a small product of it. This is why the principle of symmetry is all- encompassing and can dissolve all logic, leading to the asymmetrical relations perfectly symmetrical.Cooper, Paul. “Unconscious Process: Zen and Psychoanalytic Versions.” Journal of Religion and Health 39.1 (2000): 57-69. To show the illogical nature of symmetry, Matte Blanco said: \\"In the thought system of symmetry, time does not exist. An event that occurred yesterday can also occur today or tomorrow. Traumatic events of the past are not only seen in the unconscious as ever present and permanently happening but also about to happen.\\"Klaus Fink, in Casement, p. 180 He said that \\"We are always, in a given mental product, confronted by a mixture of the logic of the unconscious with that of the preconscious and consciousness\\".Matte Blanco, I. (1988) Thinking, Feeling and Being London and New York: Routledge Matte Blanco gives this mixture of two logics the name bi-logic and points out that our thinking is usually bi-logical, expressing the both types of logic to differing extents. Strata Matte Blanco saw in-depth analysis of the mind as falling into five broad strata: in which there is a particular combination of symmetrical and asymmetrical logic' appropriate to each one.Rayner/Tuckett, p. 23 In what he terms the first stratum, experience is characterized by the conscious awareness of separate objects. At this level thinking is mostly delimited and asymmetrical — closest to \\"normal\\", everyday life, to what W. R. Bion termed the mind of the \\"work group\\"...anchored to a sophisticated and rational level of behaviour.Rayer/Tuckett, p. 23W. R. Bion, Experiences in Groups (London 1980) p. 98 and p. 66 A second stratum can be defined by the appearance of a significant amount of symmetrization within otherwise asymmetrical thinking, so that for example a man in love will attribute to the beloved young woman...all the characteristics of the class of beloved woman, but (bi-logically) he will realize that his young woman also has limitations and defects.Rayner/Tuckett, p. 23-4 The next deeper, third stratum is one where different classes are identified (thus containing a fair amount of asymmetrical thinking) but in which...parts of a class are always taken as the whole class — symmetrization (plus a degree of timelessness).Rayner/Tuckett, p. 24 The fourth stratum is defined by the fact that there is formation of wider classes which are also symmetrized, while asymmetry becomes less and less. Thus because \\"being a man\\" is a wider class than ones men, women and children, being a man is also equivalent to being a woman and a child. In this fourth and rather deep stratum, a number of the features of the Freudian unconscious are also characteristic. There is an absence of contradiction, also an identity of psychical and external reality.Rayner/Tuckett, p. 25 Finally, the deepest, fifth stratum is that in which processes of symmetrization tend towards the mathematical limit of indivisibility thinking, which requires asymmetrical relations, is greatly impaired and becomes the realm of psychotic functioning: without asymmetrical logic, play breaks down into delusion.Rayner/Tuckett, p. 25Rayner, in Parsons, p. 49 Normal human development for Matte Blanco, involved gradual familiarity with all five strata, including the capacity both to differentiate and to move between them all; in abnormal states, this continuity of differentiation between the strata becomes fractured or confused.N. G. Rucker/K. L. Lombardi, Subject Relations (1998) p. 17 Thus, asymmetrical thoughts are said to be at the surface, while the symmetrical relations make up multiple lower strata that go deeper until an “invisible mode” or total symmetry is reached. In the deeper, completely unconscious levels, a statement such as “Jane is the mother of Jasmine” is equally valid as “Jasmine is the mother of Jane”. This statement reversal sounds preposterous to logical, asymmetrical, conscious thought, but the depth of the unconscious has its own rules. There, such a statement is true and incontestable. In this way, the principle of symmetry changes the asymmetrical to symmetrical or, put another way, the logical into the illogical.Cooper, Paul. “Unconscious Process: Zen and Psychoanalytic Versions.” Journal of Religion and Health 39.1 (2000): 60-61. Influence Matte Blanco hoped that his logical underpinning of the unconscious would contribute to development in other areas of knowledge, apart from psychoanalysis.Rayner, E. (1995) Unconscious Logic: An Introduction to Matte Blanco's Bi-logic and Its Uses. London and New York: Routledge. There are applications in theology.Bomford, R. (1999) The Symmetry of God. London: Free Association Books Other applications can be found in art and literature. A number of writers have explored parallels between the work of Matte Blanco and of Gregory Bateson including Margaret Arden, Horacio Etchegoyen and Jorge L. Ahumada. Papers by Arden, Etchegoyen and Ahumada are summarized in Rayner.Rayner, E.

The rise of ubiquitous Hausa settlements in some major Yoruba cities is mostly attributed to the inter-ethnic or long distance trading networks that developed overtime in West Africa. The exact time-line is unknown but span a millennium. In the early period of the last century, a stream of migrant Hausa settlers began to settle in major Yoruba cities, as a result of their desire to embrace their traditional customs and their \\"different\\" norms, they preferred to own their own space in foreign towns under the rulership of a Sarkin Hausawa. However, the quarters became avenues which Hausa communities in Niger and Northern Nigeria use to consolidate their trading networks. The advent of nationalism however, put a dent on the Hausa's desire to create their own identity. The two major southern parties promoted the idea of a single region of different interest groups working towards the same goal: nationalism. Since the 1950s, Hausa groups are sometimes seen as political interest groups courted for political affiliations to strengthen southern interest among Northern Nigerians. History The Hausa communities in Yoruba land originated as a necessity of long distance trading. Hausa men developed as specialized dealers in Cattle which was abundant in Northern Nigeria but dangerous to breed in Yoruba areas. The need for cattle among Yorubas and Kola among Hausa men created an avenue for trade. Hausa men originally lodged at Yoruba owned houses when in Yoruba towns for business and then later gradually increased in minute numbers. But over-time, accusations were leveled against some Hausas, coupled with the need to own their own identity, a quarter was awarded to them in different cities by the native rulers. A powerful man of influence would be recognized as the head, he is usually called the Sarkin Hausawa of the city. Cultural features The Hausa men in Sabo are fervent in their religious obligations. Prayers according to Islamic rites of the Tijaniyya order is a norm in most areas. However, there are a some who practice the cult of Bori. Most times, the Islamic morning prayer is performed alone while the four others are performed collectively. In the community, attaining wealth and Islamic knowledge are the two major criteria for success. Sabo communities became known for having a large number of Mallams or Muslim clerics.

He was sentenced to death and thus hanged on 18 October 1749.Cleary, Thomas Raymond. \\"Henry Fielding, political writer\\", 1984. p. 276 Bosavern is believed to have been mistakenly identified, although he was present at the time of the murder. Penlez was the subject of a 55-page treatise by Henry Fielding entitled \\"The Case of the Unfortunate Bosavern Penlez\\" that year.Cleland, John, \\"The Case of the Unfortunate Bosavern Penlez\\", 1750 Penlez was given a proper burial after a last-minute attempt to save him failed. Bosavern Penlez's life Bosavern Penlez was born in Exeter, Devon, in 1726. His father was a clergyman of the Church of England, who, when alive, gave his son a good education. Subsequent to his father’s death, the Stuarts of the Sons of ClergyBosavern Penlez Biography http://www.exclassics.com/newgate/ng428.htm took care of Bosavern, and, when he was old enough they apprenticed him to a barber and wig maker in the city of Exeter. Bosavern worked there for about seven years (the normal length of time for apprenticeships at that time), before deciding to move to London with the hope of setting up a business of his own. Bosavern remained in London until the night he was arrested for allegedly being involved in the Riot at the brothel \\"The Star\\", located in the Strand.  Bosavern's arrest  The Sailor's Revenge, or the Strand in an Uproar. (1 July 1749) The riot at \\"The Star\\" was part of a wave of riots started the previous night by some sailors. The seamen had stopped at the brothel \\"The Crown\\" where they had been robbed of their watches, bank-notes, and some money. Upon their demand of being remunerated for their loss, they were pushed out of the brothel and therefore decided to seek revenge. At that time popular vengeance was very often targeted on brothels, as they were considered houses of sin, and in a society prevailed by religious fanaticism sin was believed to be the first step towards crime.Hitchcock, Tim; Shoemaker, Robert; Tales from the Hanging Court, London: Hodder Arnold, 2007, p. 106. On that occasion, the Sailors gathered some of their companions and the group returned at night and broke into the brothel, turning the women into the street, breaking the windows and furniture and setting the building on fire. However, their fury didn’t stop with the destruction of \\"The Crown\\" and the following night they attacked two other brothels, the second of which was \\"The Star\\". As was usual in cases of rioting, a body of soldiers was called upon to restore order. This led to the arrest of several men. Bosavern was not arrested until later the same night, when a watchmen found him, drunk, in an alley not far from \\"The Star\\", with a bundle in his hands. When the watchman asked what he had in his hands, Bosavern answered:Hitchcock, Tim; Shoemaker, Robert, Tales from the Hanging Court, London: Hodder Arnold, 2007, p. 110. \\"I am an unfortunate young man, and have married one of the women of the town, who hath pawned all my clothes, and I have got all her linen for it\\".Henry Fielding, A true state of the cause of Bosavern Penlez (1749) in Enquiry into the Causes, ed. Zirker, pp 5-6. '' Bow street, late 19th century The bundle of linen he was hiding under his clothes consisted of caps, handkerchiefs, ruffles, clouts and aprons. Once taken to the watchhouse, Bosavern claimed a different version about the bundle, saying he had found it in the street. It was a lie. The next day he and other prisoners were examined by the justice of peace Henry Fielding, at his house in Bow Street. There, Jane Wood, wife of the keeper of \\"The Star\\" recognized the linen as being of her own property. During the justice's interview with Bosavern, rioters gathered outside the house and claimed the intention to break in. As a result, all the prisoners were committed to the Prison of Newgate, to be tried with the charge of:Hitchcock, Tim; Shoemaker, Robert, Tales from the Hanging Court, London: Hodder Arnold, 2007, p. 109. \\"High treason in levying war against his majesty by riotously and tumultuously assembling themselves together in order to suppress and pull down all bawdy houses\\".LMA, MJ/SP/1749/07/096.  Awaiting Trial  Newgate Prison between in 18th century. During the awaiting for the trial, many of the prisoners convicted were rescued by the mob. Unfortunately one of them died, so that in the end only 5 people including Bosavern remained in custody. All five of them were charged by terms of the Riot Act of 1715. The decision, which entailed death penalty, led to many controversies as it was regarded as an act of tyranny, considering that rioters were usually only fined. What’s more, one of the main articles of the Riot Act, stated that a magistrate had to read a proclamation to disperse the riot. A proclamation that was never actually read. For this reason, the grand jury rejected the charges against two of the prisoners, thus reducing to three the number of prisoners actually tried. Bosavern Penlez, John Wilson and Benjamin Ladder were charged for: \\"being feloniously and riotously assembled to the disturbance of the public peace, did begin to demolish the dwelling house of Peter Wood\\"Old Bailey Proceedings Online (www.oldbaileyonline.org, version 7.2, 18 October 2015), Ordinary of Newgate's Account, October 1749 (OA17491018).  The Trial  Peter Wood, keeper of \\"The Star\\", was the main witness for prosecution and his testimony was supported by his wife and his servant. During the cross-examination Wood’s wife and servant gave contradictory evidences, whilst other witnesses testified to Peter Wood’s bad character. What's more it was found that he hadn’t paid the rubbish removal tax and that he served liquors without having a license. Benjamin Ladder was found to have an alibi, as, a soldier on the way to \\"The Star\\" met him on the road and asked Ladder to go buy a pint of beer for him. This evidence discredited Wood’s testimony of Ladder being inside \\"The Star\\" and causing any damage before the soldiers arrived. Upon this evidence, Ladder was acquitted and only Bosavern and Wilson were sentenced to death. This sentence led to a wave of contrasting opinions among the public, which resulted in a petition to the King for the suspension of the punishment. Seen that even the jurors who had previously convicted Penlez and Wilson, signed the petition, and that Peter’s wood testimony could not be trusted, Wilson was pardoned, but not Penlez.Hitchcock, Tim; Shoemaker, Robert; Tales from the Hanging Court, London: Hodder Arnold, 2007, pp. 112-116.  The Final Sentence  Execution at Tyburn, in a seventeenth century print. When he was taken, Penlez was indicted for both burglary (for having stolen Jane Wood’s linen) and rioting (for having been found destroying \\"The Star\\"), but once convicted for one charge, the judge decided he couldn’t be tried again for another charge related to the same circumstances of the first one. The public opinion was oblivious to Penlez’s second indictment, which was brought to the attention of the crown by Henry Fielding. The king, thus found himself divided between the desire to pardon the defendants and the will to provide a representative punishment that could prevent the mob from setting up further riots. The decision to pardon Wilson and execute Penlez was taken in the light of Penlez’s additional charge of theft.Hitchcock, Tim; Shoemaker, Robert; Tales from the Hanging Court, London: Hodder Arnold, 2007, pp. 116-117. Bosavern Penlez was executed at Tyburn on Wednesday 18 October 1749.  Post Sentence Criticism  Public opinion against Penlez’s execution went on throughout autumn, and the case became involved with the election campaign of a member of Westminster parliament. Public’s opinion mainly rested on the government candidate, Lord Trentham’s inability to obtain a pardon for Penlez. Later on, in November an anonymous author published a pamphlet entitled \\"The case of the unfortunate Bosavern Penlez\\", claiming the utterly unjust execution of Penlez. The pamphlet attacked Wood’s testimony about Ladder, referring to it as \\"a pack of lies\\".Hitchcock, Tim; Shoemaker, Robert; Tales from the Hanging Court, London: Hodder Arnold, 2007, p. 120. Therefore, if he indeed had lied about Ladder he shouldn’t have been trusted regarding Penlez. This claim constituted a criticism on Henry Fielding's conduct, as he was the one to shed light on Penlez’s second indictment. Fielding, not wanting his reputation to be put at stake, published a pamphlet entitled \\"A true State of the case of Bosavern Penlez\\", in which he defended the way in which he had handled the case.Hitchcock, Tim; Shoemaker, Robert; Tales from the Hanging Court, London: Hodder Arnold, 2007, pp. 119-120.

It takes place in Tokyo, Japan, in the year 2020, revolving around the lives of fourteen-year-old Tsukasa Kozuki as she acts as bodyguard for her classmate, Ryuji Shirogami, who is the third generation boss of the yakuza group, Kuryugumi.  Plot  It's the year 2020 AD. Tokyo which is a futuristic society, complete with flying skateboards, laser guns and a variety of advanced technology. It is also a city infested with crime with far fewer women than men, with a subsequently higher amount of violence against women. It is also an example of moral decay; the series opens with a girl being attacked in broad daylight with people apathetically passing by, remarking that she should take care of herself. Not wanting their daughter to suffer the same fate, Tsukasa Kozuki's cop parents raise and teach her to live as a boy. While Tsukasa's parents investigate the murder of her classmate's, Ryuji Shirogami's, father, who is the leader of the powerful Kuryugumi yakuza group, they are both killed in one of the yakuza's in-fights. The deaths leave both Tsukasa and Ryuji orphans, with Ryuji succeeding the group as their third generation boss, known as the Sandaime, and Tsukasa on the streets with her three brothers. With no other options left, she goes to Ryuji whom she has known for eight years with hopes for shelter. After catching their parents' killer, Tsukasa becomes indebted to Ryuji when her brothers eat a veritable fortune on his tab and he uses the opportunity to tie her into becoming his personal bodyguard until her debt is paid off. Intrigued by her, Ryuji keeps slapping on an increasing amount of debt onto Tsukasa using all manners of ploys necessary to keep the reluctant Tsukasa by his side. The story mainly centers on the developing romance and relationship between Tsukasa and Ryuji, which has a vast array of difficulties. Tsukasa has dreams of becoming a police officer like her parents, which conflicts with Ryuji's position as the boss of the largest syndicate in the Kantō area of Japan. At the same time, Kuryugumi, as an extremely powerful yakuza group, has many conflicts and gang wars with other groups, making up the rest of the story's conflict. Characters=Main Characters ; :Tsukasa is the only daughter of two police officers. Upon their deaths in investigating the death of the second Kuryugumi boss, she becomes involved with the next boss of Kuryugumi, Ryuji, who has been her classmate for the past eight years. She was raised as a boy because her mother saw too many women as victims at crime scenes and wanted to shield her from the excessive sexual and violent mistreatment of women. As the child of two cops, she despises corruption and cruelty and wants to be a cop herself one day. :She has an extremely happy and bright personality and thinks that the world is a crazy place, but that she can do her part to make it better. She was trained to fight by her parents and subsequently, at the start of the story, is already an excellent fighter and is rarely defeated in a fight. (She fights with a chain whip that ends in a handle that can alternately be extended into a blade.) Incidentally, she also hates the yakuza, citing them at fault for many of the wrongs of the world. :Although Tsukasa dresses up as a boy for most of the story (she has a chest protector that flattens out her breasts), she is actually a very attractive female with a tall and excellent figure. Hence, whenever she dresses in female clothes and wigs (which she calls it \\"cross-dressing\\", since she thinks of herself as a man), she looks much more mature and is often the subject of catcalling and other sexual overtures. Despite this, she is completely clueless of other people's romantic interest towards her, especially with Ryuji. She is also blind to the feelings she develops for him, often confusing her for most of the story. :Tsukasa and Ryuji have attended school together since kindergarten. When she was eleven years old, Tsukasa slipped on a river bank and fell in. Due to hiding as a boy, she never attended swimming classes and nearly drowns. Ryuji, who was watching her from the bridge, quickly jumped in and saved her and performed CPR on her, therefore discovering that she's actually female. Ryuji is thus aware of Tsukasa's true gender from the beginning of the story. :Tsukasa has three brothers: her supposedly fraternal twin, Toshiyuki (14), younger brother, Shohei (13), and older brother, Takuma (16). :Tsukasa later found out that she is the adopted daughter of the Kozukis and that she is actually the daughter of Wakasa Ayabe and the yakuza leader of Hougougumi, which after the deaths of Wakasa and her husband consequently fell apart. Wakasa had given her daughter to her friends, the Kozukis, along with the kagi to the drug, shortly after Tsukasa's birth knowing that she was going to die. Tsukasa finds inklings about her true parentage after Ryuji was shot and in the hospital, and having it confirmed by Wakasa's former bodyguard. Since learning her origins and after Ryuji's been shot, she promises him to stay always by his side (thus, she implies on becoming his seisai). ; :As the Sandaime - third generation leader - of the Kuryugumi group, he has been raised with the constant goal of succeeding. He rarely shows his emotions on his face and, as long as Tsukasa can remember, has been an excessively gloomy and sober child. Though not obsessive about exacting justice in the way Tsukasa is, he has his own moral code and holds himself to high standards of behavior if not society's. :Though Tsukasa is his bodyguard, she has wondered why he needs one as he is excellently skilled in karate, kendo, judo, aikido, and kyūdō. He is additionally always well-armed (he fought Shiva, Tsukasa's true uncle who had his memories imprinted on a core and survived death, with a knife embedded in his watch) and an excellent fighter, though Tsukasa generally fights the most central battles in the story. :His mother died giving birth to him and he was given over to Toshiyuki Kamojima, a lower-ranked yakuza whose pregnant girlfriend had recently been murdered, to be raised. While his own father did love him, he felt that distance was necessary in raising the next-generation leader and generally kept away from Ryuji in his formative years, leaving Kamojima as his father-figure. :Ryuji is intelligent, cynical, manipulative and in some respects very Machiavellian. However, he is very loyal and does what he can to be kind to the people he cares about, though that is a very short list. Alternately, he is not at all hampered by Tsukasa's naïveté and is fully aware of his attraction towards her from the beginning of the story. He feels relaxed around Tsukasa, she is the only person he has allowed to see him sleeping, and his bodyguard comments to Tsukasa that around her, Ryuji actually looks and appears his young age. He enjoys tormenting and teasing Tsukasa, but under all the teasing does truly care for her to a large extent. It is shown that she is literally the only person who can make him smile and lively in life. It is also revealed that he has had a crush on Tsukasa since elementary school, but was initially disturbed by his feelings when believing her to be a boy until discovering her true gender, much to his relief. Later in the story, after Kamo-san was killed by one of the Ultimate weapons, Tsukasa confronts him, saying that he doesn't need to hide his true emotions in front of her. He then gives into his grief and begins to weep and Tsukasa embraces and comforts him. :Despite his relationship with Tsukasa, Ryuji is engaged to Asago Sumon, the daughter of one of his lower bosses, who has essentially been raised for the role of being his wife. While Ryuji cares for Asago, who is genuinely in love with him, it is in the way that a brother cares for a sister, which Asago does not fully realize until much later. He cares for Asago so much that he always try to protect her from danger; he even takes a bullet, which almost costs him his life, during a dispute with another gang in order to save her. His engagement to her is to prevent clan conflict since the clans under Kuryugumi all accept Asago as an appropriate candidate. Despite his engagement to Asago, it doesn't stop Ryuji whatsoever from pursuing Tsukasa, causing great tension among the three. At the end, he manages to cancel the engagement with Asago and his relationship with Tsukasa becomes stronger. Kuryugumi ; :Ryuji's late father known by his title Nidaime (the 2nd generation) who was killed by Odawara. He was admired much by Kamo-san and Ryuji developed his almost identical look. He made a promise with Kaya regarding her sister, that Ryuji went on to fulfill in his own time, and took personal interest in Kamo-san's intent on getting revenge. He had given Ryuji to Kamo-san after he was released from the hospital, giving him the name 'Ryuji'; the name Kamo-san was planning to give to his own son. His name and Ryuuji's have the kanji for 'dragon' (龍) in them (Ryū in Ryūji and Tatsu in Tatsuya). ; :She is Ryuji's late mother and was Tatsuya's seisai. Her existence is finally mentioned in ep. 85. It is left assumed that she died while giving birth to Ryuji. ; ::One of Ryuji's main associates and bodyguards. Kamo-san is the older of the two and has served Nidaime, Ryuji's father as well. He probably knows Ryuji the best out of all the Kuryugumi members and is usually seen with a smile on his face. He would very much like to see Tsukasa and Ryuji get together, knowing how happy the two make each other, and that Tsukasa would make an excellent seisai for Ryuji. Hence, he is determined to find ways to get the two closer to each other romantically, often making observations of the two's interactions with each other and helping them navigate through their growing and often complicated feelings, and to finally admit their feelings for one another. He is a father-like figure to Ryuji, since he had raised him since he was a baby and sees him as his own son. When he dies during the great gang war, his final request is for Tsukasa to look after Ryuji. When younger, he went on a killing spree because Hanawa killed and raped Kamo-san's pregnant wife while recording a video and sell it on the black market. ; :Bun-san is more serious compared to Kamo-san. He is more of a brotherly figure contrasted with Kamo-san's fatherly nature. He accepts that Tsukasa is very capable of the position of seisai. He greatly lacks skill at using his gun (according to Tsukasa) and is also Ryuji's main chauffeur. He is shown not to be fond of children. He and Kamo-san are one of the few people who know of Tsukasa's true gender and her ties with Wakasa. ; :' and ', The two younger members of Kuryugumi who get into trouble often. Shigaraki has light coloured hair and has his left ear pierced a couple of times while Muko has dark coloured hair mostly swept back. The both of them do not get along well with each other, even when teamed up, and both shared a dislike towards Tsukasa at first. Mitsugi and Shinji were disowned by their parents before finishing elementary school and were passed around to different relatives before simply becoming runaways at the age of 13. They were picked off the street by Ryuji two years prior to the story and are very loyal to Ryuji. ;Yui :She was in a relationship with Kamo-san 14 years prior to the story and the two were deeply in love. She was pregnant with his child, a son, and planned on naming him Ryuji. However, she is soon raped and killed by Hanawa, the kumicho of Hanawagumi. She had made a promise with Kamo-san to keep smiling. When Kamo-san is killed and departs from the living world, the two happily reunite in the after life. ; :Doctor of Kuryugumi's private hospital (inside Kuryugumi's main house). She was ordered by Ryuji to find out how Paramelt works and to \\"cure\\" Tsukasa. She was concerned about Tsukasa's decision to continue staying like a boy despite being aware of Tsukasa and Ryuji's mutual feelings towards each other. She tries to convince Tsukasa to act more like a female, much to little success. She enjoys teasing both Ryuji and Tsukasa, especially about the relationship between them. Silver Dragon Clan ; :Asago's father, and head of the Silver Dragon Clan. He raised Asago strictly so that she would become the perfect seisai candidate and expects a lot from her, often fearing he will be shamed by her actions. He was shot by a sniper, but has since recovered. He has a wife who has been given very little information. He appears to be more timid than the other clan heads, highly kumi oriented, and very strict in the upbringing of Kuryugumi's main lady. After Ryuji is shot, he refused to allow Asago back in his house, saying that she is no longer a Sumon. While he used to shower Asago with sarcastic remarks, he abruptly stopped after a single comment from Ryuji. ; :In the beginning of the story, she was introduced as Ryuji's fiancee (seisai, literally translated as the good/right/holy wife). She was aiming to be like Durga, a legendary female figure whom she admires, who acts as her husband's right hand, although has little success in doing so. She is the only daughter of Sumon, the head of the Silver Dragon Clan and the head clan under Kuryugumi. Asago is very jealous that Ryuji spends most his time with Tsukasa and not her, even when under the impression that Tsukasa is a boy. She is quick to show her temper and is reluctant to trust Tsukasa as she is a katagi (a child of a cop/law-abiding citizen). Like Ryuji, she's can use a gun well and can use two at once, although not initially good at it. She doesn't seem to truly trust anyone except Ryuji. :In the beginning, Asago believes that Tsukasa is male until later realizing that, much to her dismay, Tsukasa is actually a girl. After seeing the attraction between the two, she was willing to do anything to prevent Ryuji and Tsukasa from being together, even threatening Tsukasa's brothers lives and shooting one of them in the leg as a warning to keep her distance from him. During a fight between Karyugumi and other gangs, she loses her left arm and she's quite worried of her unstable status. After Ryuji protected Asago from being shot, nearly killing him, she began living in guilt and even contemplated suicide, but changed her mind after meeting Munakata, a cop, and even began to regret her actions towards Tsukasa. Eventually, she accepts that Tsukasa is the only one who Ryuji can truly be comfortable with. She eventually shows some feelings towards the scarred cop and later confesses her feelings to him at the hospital after the great gang war, which he returns. Her father tries to break the two up, due to Munakata being a cop, but she refuses to give in since he truly makes her happy. Gold Dragon Clan ; :Oyabun of the Gold Dragon Clan under Kuryugumi. He has short curly dark hair, and is very greedy. He let out the kumi's secret about the Inverted Cross and lured customers away from the Silver Dragon Clan's business by passing out the illegal weapons. Like his daughter, he carries a gun, but is not very good. (He had missed shooting Tsukasa even in a close range shot.) He wanted to be promoted to become leader of the head clan. ; :Daughter of Shibata Hiroto, oyabun of the Gold Dragon clan under Kuryugumi. She looks like a female version of Ryuji with long wavy light colored hair and large breasts with a large ego. She fell in love with Ryuji at first sight, although she's much older than he is. This caused her to challenge Asago in her position as Durga. She can handle a gun, but not very well. She loves to show off her wealth and her body, glares a lot and treats other people especially those \\"inferior\\" to her as scum. ; The person who betrayed Kuryugumi and killed the Nidaime. He was later kept alive, but living a life worse than death, according to what Ryuji told him. ; A good friend of Kamo-san, who knew him since they were younger. He is also one of the people who knew Yui and Kamo-san's relationship and that Yui and their unborn baby were killed. Later, he was there with Kamo-san when he died. Purple Dragon Clan ; :The oyabun of the Purple Dragon Clan. One of the evil quartet, and often speaks on their behalf. He has a daughter who was raised to be a possible seisai, the one who spoke out at the recent executive meeting. He appears to be power hungry and always seems to be picking on Asago and always gets beat up by Tsukasa. He never thought he'd listen to any of Tsukasa's orders, but in the battle against the Ultimate Weapons, he found himself doing just that. ; :The daughter of the Purple Dragon Clan's Kyuragi. She has short light coloured hair, false large [inflatable] breasts, and is madly in love with Ryuji, but was rejected. She is shown to be conniving and sneaky and was the one who injected Asago with a drug that paralyzed her left arm temporarily. She is pretty good with a gun and wants to be the kage no seisai. She almost made Tsukasa misunderstand that she saw Ryuji's sleeping face, when Tsukasa was initially happy believing that she was the only one who saw his sleeping face. However, it turned out that she drugged him with sleeping pills, which caused him to fall asleep for three days straight. She is genetically modified to become a female, just to be his seisai. She is also the reason that Tsukasa came to realize that she loves Ryuji differently from how she loves Akira. White Dragon Clan ; :The oyabun of the White Dragon Clan and one of the evil quartet, who opposed to Asago being the seisai. Has a daughter who was raised to be a possible seisai. ; :The daughter of the White Dragon Clan's Usui. She seems to be the youngest out of the \\"evil quartet's\\" daughters. She has long wavy hair, and the biggest eyes out of the four girls while the shortest of them who are trying to become the ura no seisai. She is younger than Ryuji. Red Dragon Clan ; :The oyabun of the Red Dragon Clan. He is one of the evil quartet. The guy with the major receding hairline and has a daughter who was raised to be a possible seisai. ; :A daughter of the Red Dragon Clan's Kawazoe. She long straight dark hair and looks the most evil of the \\"evil quartet's\\" daughters. She appears to be around eighteen. Green Dragon Clan ; :The oyabun of the Green Dragon Clan. One of the evil quartet, who recommended that Asago have a bodyguard. ; :Daughter of the Green Dragon Clan's Mooka with long brown wavy hair and the tallest of the four girls. Possibly, she is the oldest of the girls. Blue Dragon ClanThe Kōzuki Family ; :The mother of the four Kozukis and the one who decided to raise Tsukasa as a boy rather than as a girl. Also a member of the police special task force GRAVE. She was killed while investigating Hizakigumi. She possibly has orange hair and was entrusted a deep secret of Garyukai. She seems to have had contact with Wakasa and a strong sense of justice. She raised Tsukasa to be strong. ; :The father of the four Kozukis and the person that Kise Akira admired. He was a member of the police special task force known as GRAVE that dealt with the rising crime. He was killed while chasing Hizakigumi while off duty, a few days after Ryuji's father was killed. He was the one who trained Tsukasa when she was little. He also had a strong sense of justice and was the inventor of Tsuaksa's protector. He knew Ayabe Wakasa and even called her \\"Waka-chan\\". ; :Tsukasa's youngest brother who is known as cutest and probably the most spoiled. He too wouldn't mind seeing his sister getting together with Ryuji. He also works as a host of a gay bar. He light coloured hair and does not plan on abandoning Tsukasa, even if she was not related to him by blood. ; :Tsukasa's apparent twin brother, although in the first story, he was introduced as Sho's twin. He's the younger twin and has no problem with Tsukasa getting along with Sandaime. Like his other brothers, he works as a host of a gay bar. He has medium dark hair. Even after learning he is not related to his sister by blood, he continues to care very much for her. ; :Tsukasa's older brother. Unlike his other brothers, he doesn't approve of his sister forming any form of connection with Ryuji. He dropped out of school to help with his family's expenditure and works as a dealer at a casino. He is very reliable and is family-oriented. He is a friend of Onda and highly recommends Akira as a boyfriend to Tsukasa. He knows a deep dark secret about Garyukai and is trying to prevent Tsukasa from being involved with them. He will forever act as big brother towards Tsukasa even if they're not blood relatives. ; :The woman who lives with the Kozuki brothers. She lost her parents since childhood, and her younger sister left her some time ago, due to a martial arts competition where she was killed. When the will to live left her, Tatsuya (Kuryugumi's Nidaime) has saved her. She hates fighting and often tries to discourage Tsukasa from fighting, much to little effect. Police Officers ; :A cop who kept appearing whenever the police were called. He admired Tsukasa's father, Kozuki Yutaka, and decided to become a police officer after meeting with him. He's really tall, muscular, unbelievably strong, funny and honest. He hates the yakuza, especially Kuryugumi, who he thinks is responsible for Kozuki Yutaka's death. He seems to have a bit of a sad past, as he was abandoned by his parents. He got to be a member of the GRAVE section of the Control Police after catching the person involved in the bombing at New Heaven Tokio. He is Munakata's partner. He is also one of the few people who knows that Tsukasa is female and has an interest in her, even though he's much older (24). He views Ryuji as a rival for her affection. ; :A member of the GRAVE section of the control police and is Akira's partner, after the latter joined GRAVE. He is usually cool and calm and has a scar that runs down the right side of his face. He appears to have a tendency to become as violent as the criminal he catches. He has to be stopped from killing the criminal according to other colleagues. When he changes to his \\"violent\\" side, all colleagues stay clear of him in fear, and consider it to be his partner's (Akira) job to stop him. Despite his violent side, he has a very sweet side to him. He also claims that he lives only to protect women and is known to use his police cruiser as a mobile hotel. He's the same age as Akira, but looks like an oyaji according to Asago. He has a soft spot for Asago. He happens to be Nakamura's (the author’s) favorite character. ; :A female cop who took Akira as a date to New Heaven Tokio. She has light colored hair up in a ponytail. She has a strong sense for justice, very direct and can be short tempered at times. A good friend of Akira. Currently, she is a member of GRAVE, likely promoted the same time Akira was. She is last seen in the scene before Akira decides to take Tsukasa as his date to Tokonome Island. She also is aware of the fact that Tsukasa is actually female. Hogougumi ; :The legendary shadow seisai to the currently disbanded Hogougumi. She looks like a more mature version of Tsukasa with long dark hair. Not much is known about her except that she took the fighting half of the weak omote no seisai to the Hogougumi kumicho. She was very good at fighting, either weaponless or with a katana. She was the origin for the title of Durga. Despite being rumored to have had no physical contact with her 'husband', she pledged complete loyalty to him. However, it was found out that she slept with Hogou's kumicho, fell pregnant and had a baby girl (who is later revealed to be Tsukasa). It was later found out further that she only slept with him because he said that is the only way he can get over her, but Shiva misunderstood and thought she loved Sou. She was abandoned by Hogougumi when it was threatened by Garyukai over 14 years ago according to Shiki. She went out to kill Mikaido Shiva, according to Azuma. She entrusted the kagi, or the key to Garyukai's top secret, to the Kozuki family. She went to kill Shiva due to her love for him and wanted to die together with him at the same time. ;{Omote no seisai} :The ‘real’ wife to Hogougumi's kumicho and mother to Shiki. She was the visible wife of the kumi, and was unable to fight. However, she was rumored to be the motherly figure for the kumi. She was good friends with Wakasa, and even persuaded Wakasa to continue on with her pregnancy (leading to Tsukasa's birth). She is presumed dead. She had long, wavy light colored hair. ; :The kumicho to Hogougumi and father to Shiki and Tsukasa. He had two seisais, a visible one and an invisible one. He has short dark hair and a younger brother known as Shiva. He is also presumed dead. Garyūkai ; :He was killed by Wakasa for betraying Hogougumi, yet appears in Misumi's body. Due to a brain core operation, he is able to live in someone else's body. It is shown in the story that he has a strong interest for Tsukasa because she looks exactly like her mother whom he had feelings for. Even though he's biologically Tsukasa's uncle (since he's Sou's younger brother), there is a time where he marks her neck. He has a long flowing black hair, when in Misumi's body. He has quite a sad past, and he stated that Wakasa was the only one who looked at him rather than past him, unlike the others around him, who only paid attention to his older brother. He had a weak constitution and thought of his brother as a rival. He is in love with Wakasa, and was devastated when she had sex with his brother, believing that she loved his brother. He returned Misumi's body to Shiki after watching Wakasa's video, which was left to Tsukasa, and decided to return to the time when Wakasa killed him, so that he can die together with her. ; :The artificial panther-like creature that has been created for the purpose of searching for Wakasa's related DNA. It was first seen when Tsukasa was on the trip with her classmates after their exam. When she saw it, she noticed the eyes lit up red, and got scared. It was later found out that the eyes lit up red when it sensed Wakasa's blood nearby. When Shiva was almost shot by Oguro, Kahry protected him by taking the bullet. Despite being shot, it did not die since it is not a real panther. Shiva lets him stay by Tsukasa in the end to protect her, much to Shiki's surprise, as he commented that he never let it out of his sight because Kahry was created to look like Wakasa. In the last few chapters of the manga, Kahry was shown to be really playful with Tsukasa, sensing her presence when she reaches Kuryugumi and ends up wrestling with her until Tsukasa is tired. ; :One of the sole survivors of Hogougumi. He is the only son of Sou and the omote no seisai, making him Tsukasa's biological half brother - even if he says he hates her, they truly act like siblings. During the battle between Garyukai and Hogougumi, he was seen as a child hidden inside a box, found by a member of Garyukai. Shiki has a deep hatred for Wakasa because he believes that she had abandoned him and the gumi. The first time he shows up is when he harasses a woman into taking drugs and gets a major beating from Tsukasa who happened to be passing by at the time. ;Freya :The most powerful 'ultimate weapon' of the drug. She plays a big role to the story because she is the reason why Tsukasa got found out as a girl by Kuryugumi in volume 17. She fought and killed the 'ordinary' gokudos very quickly, and saved the handsome ones for her playing. At the time, it was Akira, Tsukasa, and Ryuji. However, being angry when she was deceived by Tsukasa, Tsukasa ended up going one on one with her, knocking Akira unconscious, and he tried to protect her. She stopped Ryuji and the other members of Kuryugumi, those who were still living since they were not in the first batch of people with Ryuji, from participating in the fight, and can only watch as Tsukasa practically fights with a single dagger. During the fight, they described it as a great imitation of the Goddess of fighting, Durga. She also killed many of the police, and severely injured Munakata. She later dies during a fight with Tsukasa. ; An aura and face that clearly states \\"The Bad Guy\\". The only reason he wants the kagi (the key to opening the door to the plant that a drug Garyukai seeks is stemmed from) is to 'rule the world' because he is the only one with the 'right to do so'. His reasons for ruling the world or his background is unknown. Freya gets depressed because he was in charge of her and because he was \\"very ugly\\". He's later arrested by the police. ; Not much is known about him other than the fact that he resurrected Shiva in Misumi's body and he also wanted the key to rule the world. He's later murdered by Shiva while disputing over the key. He also might have been a brain core user. ; Not much is known about him other than the fact that Shiva is using his body due to the brain core operation, and Shiki is very protective of his body, not wanting any part of him to get damaged. The main reason is that Misumi took care of Shiki as a child after the disbandment of Horougumi. His body is also the only reason why Shiki remained with Shiva, so as to get his body back from Shiva.

It is cousin to the French and the Germanic werewolf . It seems like a normal human by day, but this creature takes on the form of a man with no head, who roams the night with a wooden coffin on its neck. On top of the coffin are three lighted candles and the long loose end of a heavy iron chain, noosed around its waist, trails behind him. Often, it is seen with chains around its neck, which change size.Personal interview with Pundit Bissessarnath Ramcharan-Maharaj One appendage is said to be turned backwards. It can shapeshift into various animals, including horses, pigs or goats, and said to often take the form of a creature similar to a centaur; is also thought to be a blood sucker which is less than particular about its food source, making do with such animals as cows and goats. The Lagahoo also possesses the ability to alter its size from tiny to gigantic in an instant. To kill the Lagahoo one must beat the creature with a stick which has been anointed with holy water and holy oil for nine days.

The earliest record dates from 1738 and the latest from 1944. The most severe flood occurred early on the morning of 5 February 1852, when the embankment of the Bilberry reservoir collapsed causing the deaths of 81 people. It is recorded as the 23rd most serious, worldwide, in terms of loss of life from floods and landslides in human history. 1738 Rainstorms caused the River Holme to burst its banks and flood the valley. Though there was damage to farmland there was no loss of life. 1777 Following a severe storm on Wednesday 21 July 1777 the River Holme burst its banks and flooded the valley. Three people were drowned and a stone church built in 1476 was swept away. It was rebuilt the following year with funding from local clothiers. 1821 The River Holme again flooded the valley around Holmfirth, following rainstorms on 21 September 1821, with no loss of life. 1852 Bilberry and Digley reservoirs The 1852 flood occurred when the embankment of the Bilberry reservoir collapsed, releasing 86 million gallons of water down the River Holme. It caused 81 deaths and a large amount of damage to property in the valley leaving many homeless and without work. The buildings and structures destroyed included four mills, ten dye houses, three drying stoves, 27 cottages, seven tradesmen’s houses, seven shops, seven bridges crossing the River Holme, ten warehouses, eight barns and stables. The collapse occurred at about 1.00 am on 5 February 1852 following a period of heavy rain. The story of the flood made the front page of the London Standard newspaper. An inquest after the disaster concluded that the reservoir was \\"defective in its original construction\\" and that \\"the Commissioners, in permitting the Bilberry reservoir to remain in a dangerous state with the full knowledge thereof, and not lowering the waste pit, have been guilty of great and culpable negligence\\". 1944 On Whit Monday, 29 May 1944, flash flooding following a severe thunderstorm, caused the deaths of three people in the Holme Valley. Due to reporting restrictions in place because of World War II, it was not widely reported and was overshadowed by the invasion of Normandy a week later. This led to some confusion as to the exact cause of the flood but it was confirmed that Bilberry reservoir was not to blame. It was suggested that the reservoir prevented the flood from being more severe. German prisoners of war, housed in the area, assisted with the rescue of local residents and property. There was extensive damage to properties in the valley: 17 mills, 61 shops and 109 homes were flooded. Geoffrey Riley (1929–2005), who was aged 14 at the time of the event, was awarded the George Cross in recognition of his attempts to save the life of an elderly woman caught in the flood. The woman and Geoffrey's father, who also tried to save her from drowning, both lost their lives in the flood. Geoffrey was initially awarded the Albert Medal. However, the Royal Warrant was discontinued in 1971 and he exchanged this for the George Cross at Buckingham Palace on 6 March 1973.

Opened in 1983, it is managed by the Edmonton Economic Development Corporation (EEDC), a not-for-profit enterprise owned by the City of Edmonton. It is located on Jasper Avenue and built into a hill, emerging onto Grierson Hill Road and into the Louise McKinney Riverfront Park. The riverside site allows for approximately 70 per cent of the building space to be located underground, burrowed into the cliff face, concealing the fact that the building is over 10 stories high. It is reported by EEDC that the ECC boosts Edmonton's economy by an estimated $44 million a year.Page 23 of “Forward” Edmonton Economic Development’s 2008 Annual Report History Plans for a city owned trade and convention centre, originally combined with sports (arena, stadium) facilities, had been considered for a number of years. A plebiscite asking if the city should spend $14 million ($ million today) on land and construction of a downtown sports and convention complex was rejected by voters in 1963. Edmonton citizens voted in favour of a $23 million proposal ($ million today) in the 1968 Convention and Sports Complex plebiscite, but voted against the revised $34 million ($ million today) funding request in the 1970 Omniplex project plebiscite. The area on Grierson Hill where the Centre now resides had a coal mine operation from 1892 to 1893, one of a number along the banks of the North Saskatchewan River near the turn of the century.Small mine in operation 1892 - 1893 (Real Estate & Housing, pg 12, 1978) While voters had rejected the funding for the project, a municipal bylaw allowing the city to build was still on the books. The scope of the project was reduced when the Northlands Coliseum ice hockey arena opened in 1974, followed by the Commonwealth Stadium football facility in 1978. Edmonton City Council received support from the electorate to move forward with a more focused trade and convention centre in a special plebiscite in 1979. James Wensley was awarded the Alberta Association of Architects Citation in 1983 for his work on the facility. In 1998, the facility was renamed the Shaw Conference Centre under a 20-year naming rights deal with Shaw Communications. The facility was renamed Edmonton Convention Centre in 2019 following the expiration of Shaw's naming rights. On August 29, 2017, Edmonton's city council approved a plan for the EEDC to take ownership of the Edmonton Expo Centre from Northlands, effective January 1, 2018, as a condition of relieving debt owed to the city over its renovations. In June 2019, it was announced that the ECC's glass atrium would be fitted with transparent solar panels as part of a $10.8 million project. The renovation was stated to be the largest building-integrated array of solar panels in the country, and it was estimated that the panels would produce 227,000 kilowatt hours of solar energy per-year. Installation was formally completed in June 2020; as an artistic component, the south roof was inscribed with the text of the poem \\"Gift of a river\\" by E. D. Blodgett, rendered in morse code. Location Edmonton Convention Centre on the North Saskatchewan River valley The Edmonton Convention Centre is located on Jasper Avenue and 97th street in Downtown Edmonton and can be seen in the city's skyline. The Jasper Avenue entrance opens onto the centre's glass atrium, which in turn serves as the entrance to the multiple conference levels. The long outer walls on the centre's assembly and meeting levels offer a view of the North Saskatchewan River valley parks system; a view which stretches from the downtown core to the north campus of the University of Alberta. The centre is linked via pedway to Edmonton's Canada Place, which is the main property for federal government offices in Edmonton. Canada Place is linked, in turn, to many other buildings by way of Edmonton's pedway system, including, the Citadel Theatre, the Westin Hotel, the City Hall, the Sutton Place Hotel, and the Edmonton City Centre mall. Function The facility has been used for corporate functions, banquets, conventions, as well as entertainment events such as concerts. Edmonton's anime convention Animethon moved to the Edmonton Convention Centre in 2018, replacing the MacEwan University City Centre Campus. Notable concerts The ECC has been particularly known for hosting electronic dance music events, having hosted acts such as Tiesto. Amon Amarth performed at the Edmonton Convention Centre on September 30, 2019 as part of their Berserker tour. This show gained notoriety when, after Amon Amarth finished their set, an unidentified man stabbed a concertgoer, a 34-year old David Cox, who was involved in altercation and stabbed, and then died while hospitalized.https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/man-stabbed-after-attending- amon-amarth-concert-in-edmonton/https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/man-charged- in-fatal-stabbing-after-amon-amarth-concert-in-edmonton/ NotesExternal links * Official site Convention centres in Canada Music venues in Edmonton Tourist attractions in Edmonton ","title":"Edmonton Convention Centre"},{"id":"9593198","text":"Railway Clearing House diagram of lines in Leeds in 1913 Leeds Hunslet Lane railway station was opened by the North Midland Railway in Leeds in 1840 in what was then a middle-class area, south of the city.

It marked the Broadway debut of actor Mark Baker. Originally entitled Up!, it offers a futuristic story of social outcasts living on an asteroid in the year 2972. Among them is Gabriel Finn, a space sanitation man who collects trash in a clamshell-shaped garbage ship called the Helen of Troy. The storyline was so incomprehensible that at the last moment producers decided to insert a plot synopsis in the Playbill, but audiences were still baffled by what they were witnessing unfold on stage. Pyrotechnic displays and other special effects did little to enhance the project. After fifteen previews, the Broadway production, directed by Peter Hall, produced by George W. George and choreographed by George Faison, opened on November 28, 1972, the first production at the brand new Uris Theatre where, unable to withstand a universal assault by the critics, it ran for only seven performances. The cast included Raul Julia, Irene Cara, Keene Curtis, Chuck Cissel, Ralph Carter, Melanie Chartoff, and Virginia Vestoff. Via Galactica, one of the first Broadway shows to lose more than $1 million, was MacDermot's second flop of the season. His Dude had closed after 16 performances a mere five weeks earlier.

Originally from the Atlas Mountains and the Rif Mountains of Morocco, the Barbary macaque population in Gibraltar is the only wild monkey population on the European continent. Although most Barbary monkey populations in Africa are experiencing decline due to hunting and deforestation, the Gibraltar population is increasing. Currently, some 300 animals in five troops occupy the Upper Rock area of the Gibraltar Nature Reserve, though they make occasional forays into the town. As they are a tailless species, they are also known locally as Barbary apes or rock apes, despite being monkeys (Macaca sylvanus). The local people simply refer to them as monos () when conversing in Spanish or Llanito (the local vernacular). The Affenberg at Salem Germany has a colony of approximately 200 of the Barbary Affen. Origin A Barbary macaque sitting on a fence at the Gibraltar Cable Car top station. The name Barbary refers to the Berber People of Morocco who since the beginning of history had ties with the animals surrounding their region, as the Barbary macaques. The macaque population had also been present on the Rock of Gibraltar long before Gibraltar was captured by the British in 1704 and according to records, since prior to reconquest of Gibraltar from the Muslims. It was during the Islamic period where a purported introduction may have taken place. In his work Historia de la Muy Noble y Más Leal Ciudad de Gibraltar (History of the Very Noble and Most Loyal City of Gibraltar), written between 1605 and 1610, Alonso Hernández del Portillo, the first chronicler of Gibraltar, wrote: In his History of Gibraltar (1782), Ignacio López de Ayala, a Spanish historian like Portillo, wrote of the monkeys: Repeated introduction of animals and the lack of reliable data concerning founders of the Gibraltar macaque population has obscured their origin. The fact that all extant Gibraltarian mtDNA haplotypes were also found in North Africa, combined with the lack of fossil evidence of M. sylvanus in Gibraltar at the end of the last glaciation, greatly diminishes the possibility that the Gibraltar macaques represent or include any remnant of the original European population, a possibility which can nevertheless not be excluded.Phylogeography of Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus) and the origin of the Gibraltar colony. Clear distinction between Algerian and Moroccan haplotypes permits attribution of the Gibraltar colony to founders from both regions. Indeed, it had been earlier suggested that the original Gibraltar macaques were a remnant of populations that had spread throughout Southern EuropeC. Michael Hogan (2008) Barbary Macaque: Macaca sylvanus, Globaltwitcher.com, ed. N. Strõmberg during the Pliocene, up to 5.5 million years ago.DNA solves mystery of Gibraltar’s macaques The Macaca sylvanus species is listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List and is declining. About 75% of the total population is found in the Middle Atlas Mountains. During the Pleistocene, this species inhabited the Mediterranean coasts and Europe, reaching as far north as Germany and the British Isles. The species decreased with the arrival of the Ice Age, to extinction in the Iberian Peninsula 30,000 years ago. Tourism Although the Barbary macaques form part of tourism in Gibraltar, direct contact with them (as shown in this photograph) is strongly discouraged. The Gibraltar Barbary macaques are considered by many to be the top tourist attraction in Gibraltar. The most popular troop is that of Queen's Gate at the Ape's Den, where people can get especially close to the monkeys. They will often approach and sometimes climb onto people, as they are used to human interaction. Nevertheless, they are still wild animals and will bite if frightened or annoyed.The Barbary Apes Tourist Attraction of Gibraltar Macaques with a chocolate bar wrapper, having stolen it from a tourist's bag in July 2016. Deliberately feeding the macaques in Gibraltar is now an offence punishable by law.

Alfred Holmes alongside two Barbary macaques, looking down on the city of Gibraltar. Gibraltar's Barbary macaque population was under the care of the British Army and later the Gibraltar Regiment from 1915 to 1991, who carefully controlled a population that initially consisted of a single troop. The 'Keeper of the Apes' would keep the official records, maintaining an up-to-date register for each ape, listing their births and names and supervising their diet, which they drew officially every week. The food allowance of fruit, vegetables and nuts was included in the budget, set by the War Office at £4 a month in 1944. They would humorously announce births in the 'Gibraltar Chronicle':— \\"Rock Apes. Births: To Phyllis, wife of Tony, at the Upper Rock, on 30th June 1942— a child. Both doing well.\\" much to the delight of readers. They were named after governors, brigadiers and high- ranking officers. Any ill or injured monkey needing surgery or any other form of medical attention was taken to Royal Naval Hospital Gibraltar and received the same treatment as would an enlisted service man. When UK-based infantry units were withdrawn and garrison duty was left to the Gibraltar Regiment, the Government of Gibraltar took over responsibility for the monkeys.

A photograph captured the Queen feeding a Barbary ape while the Duke of Edinburgh stood next to battle-dressed ape-keeper Gunner Wilfred Portlock. Management The most popular troop of macaques is based at the Ape's Den area within the Gibraltar Nature Reserve. The macaques receive a daily supply of fresh fruit and vegetables including, oranges, apples, potatoes, onions, carrots and cabbage to supplement their natural food resources. The monkeys are currently managed by the Gibraltar Ornithological and Natural History Society (GONHS), and veterinarian expertise is provided by the Gibraltar Veterinary Clinic. The macaques receive a daily supply of fresh water and vegetables, fruit and seeds as supplement to natural food resources (leaves, olives, roots, seeds and flowers). The animals are caught on a regular basis to check their health status. Additionally, body size, weight and several other measurements are taken. Finally, the animals are given a tattoo number and a microchip as a means of identification. But tattoos are not the only way to recognise individual macaques; many of them have particular marks, scars or spots which can be used as distinguishing features. All monkeys are photographed and the pictures and individual characteristics are catalogued. Cataloguing work is carried out by the GONHS. The GONHS also does collaborative studies with the Scientific Institute of Rabat-Agdal University (Morocco), the University of Notre Dame (Indiana, United States), the University of Vienna (Austria), the German Primate Centre (Germany) and the University of Zurich (Switzerland). Once every year, a census is conducted to provide data and to monitor reproductive success of the whole population. These demographic data are important for the management of the population generally, and fertility regulation in selected individuals, specifically. Since Barbary macaque females reproduce well, the population on Gibraltar is steadily increasing, which in turn puts pressure on the limited habitat. Animal population control is therefore an essential part of the effective management of the population.Info on Gibraltar Barbary Macaques from the GONHS official website In 2008 a small group of macaques that had permanently relocated to the Catalan Bay area were culled. In 2012 the Government Minister for Health and the Environment Dr. John Cortes stated that the Government was investigating the possibility of reintroducing over a hundred macaques to their natural habitat in North Africa. In October 2014, the Government of Gibraltar announced that it would export 30 of the monkeys to a safari park in Scotland. This caused a journalist spin that they were sent to Scotland for being especially \\"disruptive\\".\\"And what about the recent headlines about “disruptive monkeys” being exported to Scotland? It’s a journalistic spin; a Scottish wildlife park asked if we could let them have a troop of monkeys. We sent them a troop of 30 – one cohesive group that all knew each other.\\" (Eric Shaw) By 2017, the monkeys at the Blair Drummond Safari Park near Stirling were doing well and the first births were being registered. Legend A popular belief holds that, as long as Gibraltar Barbary macaques exist on Gibraltar, the territory will remain under British rule. In 1942 (during World War II), after the population dwindled to just a handful of individuals (just seven monkeys), British Prime Minister Winston Churchill ordered their numbers be replenished immediately from forest fragments in both Morocco and Algeria because of this traditional belief. Another story links Gibraltar to Africa by a subterranean passage over 15 miles (24 km) long which begins at Lower St. Michael's Cave and passes under the Strait of Gibraltar,St Michaels Cave and the Gibraltar Barbary macaques entered the Rock from Morocco this way.Gibraltar Taxi Association In popular culture In an 1887 satire by Jules Verne, the Spaniard Gil Braltar invades the rock with a macaque troop after disguising himself as one of them. * The Gibraltar Barbary macaque is portrayed on the Gibraltar pound's five-pence coin since 1988 and on the tercentenary edition one penny coin since 2004. * They are featured in the 2007 novel The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest by Stieg Larsson. * The Gibraltar Barbary macaques are also central to the plot of Paul Gallico's 1962 comedic novel Scruffy, set during WWII when their numbers were dwindling. * James Bond (Timothy Dalton) is startled by one in the pre-credit sequence of the 1987 film The Living Daylights during a training exercise on Gibraltar.

Estuar. Coast. Mar. Sci. 6: 117–122.  Description  This species of hermit crab can reach a shell length of up to half an inch in size. P. longicarpus coloration can vary, but body color is most commonly gray, green or white. The right claw of P. longicarpus is much larger than the left, and each claw has a tan or gray stripe down the middle. The long-wristed hermit crab inhabits the empty shells of gastropods such as periwinkles, snails, and slugs for mobile shelter and protection of their soft abdomens. They anchor themselves into the shells by wrapping their abdomens around the columella, or axis, inside the vacant shell.Allee, W., & Douglas, M. (1945). A Dominance Order in the Hermit Crab, Pagurus longicarpus Say. Ecology, 26(4), 411-412. Hermit crabs cannot produce their own shells, and therefore must scavenge for abandoned ones.Carlon, D., & Ebersole, J. (1995).

Shell Choice in Pagurus longicarpus Hermit Crabs: Does Predation Threat Influence Shell Selection Behavior? Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 56(2), 171-176. Shell selection plays many crucial roles in P. longicarpus, such as providing protection from predators, desiccation and salinity stress, as well as influencing competition, population size, and reproductive behaviors in the species. Pagurus longicarpus-naked.jpgthumbA crab out of a shell  Distribution and habitat  P. longicarpus is commonly found along the Atlantic coast of Canada and the United States, from Nova Scotia to Northeastern Florida, as well as along the Gulf coast of the United States to Texas. These hermit crabs can be found in intertidal and subtidal Atlantic environments on a variety of substrates and at depths of up to 200 meters.McDermott, J. J. (1999). Reproduction in the hermit crab Pagurus longicarpus (Decapoda: Anomura) from the coast of New Jersey. J. Crustac. Biol. 19: 612–621. Most commonly, P. longicarpus is found in shallow tidal pools during the months of April to October, and in deeper and warmer waters during the fall and winter months. P. longicarpus faces extreme temperature and salinity fluctuations while inhabiting tidal pools due to the rising and falling tides, as well as changing climate. On hot, sunny days, there is often a rapid increase in tidal pool temperature and salinity, whereas on cooler, rainier days, salinity and temperature can rapidly decrease. Rising tides can also alter tidal pool conditions to those of the surrounding ocean. Due to these harsh living conditions, P. longicarpus depends heavily on its shell to cope with changing conditions. These fluctuating conditions can also impact shell selection in the species and determine species distribution within intertidal and subtidal regions.  Diet and predation  Long-wristed hermit crabs are scavenger feeders with a broad diet consisting of detritus, organic material found in ocean surface foam, microcrustaceans and algae.Scully, EP. (1978). Utilization of Surface Foam as a Food Source by Hermit Crab, Pagurus longicarpus say, 1817. Marine Behaviour and Physiology, 5(2), 159-162. Feeding is performed by scooping sand or other substrate with the chelipeds, ripping and tearing food, and then passing it to the mouth for consumption.Roberts, M. (1968). Functional Morphology of Mouth Parts of the Hermit Crabs, Pagurus longicarpus and Pagurus pollicaris. Chesapeake Science, 9(1), 9-20. The major predators of P. longicarpus include birds, fish, snails, octopuses and other crabs, including the green crab. Hermit crab shells are crucial for protection and minimizing predation, and therefore proper shell selection is vital. P. longicarpus will avoid selecting shells with extensive damage because they are more vulnerable to predation. The most common type of damage to hermit crab shells is the presence of small holes. These holes are caused by the drilling of nacticid gastropods in order to prey on the original gastropod hosts of the shell.  Behavior  Intraspecific competition within this species is very common and is most often triggered by lack of resources.Gherardi, F. (2006). Fighting Behavior in Hermit Crabs: The Combined Effect of Resource-Holding Potential and Resource Value in Pagurus longicarpus. Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 59(4), 500-510. One of the most important limited resources to hermit crabs is their shell, which is key to their survival and reproductive success. Finding an appropriately sized shell is valuable for P. longicarpus. From an energetic standpoint, if a shell is too large, crabs will extend unnecessary energy carrying and maneuvering it. Alternatively, if the shell is too small, they could suffer from increased predation and desiccation. Shell selection also plays a role in reproductive success in P. longicarpus. Reproductive success is positively correlated with a larger shell size, and the rate of growth of the crabs can be stimulated by inhabiting larger shells. P. longicarpus also will not feed unless housed in the proper sized shell, ultimately leading to starvation and death. Each of the consequences of incorrect shell size places a strong selective pressure on obtaining the perfect shell, which often results in aggressive and competitive interactions within the species. In addition to fighting over mates and food, P. longicarpus will fight over shells. Larger crabs or crabs with less suitable shells will often forcibly remove other crabs with more desirable shells by clasping the chelae, or legs, of the occupant with its pincers, which allows them to takeover the desired shell. Along with predation, shell availability is a major factor in determining P. longicarpus population size.  Reproduction  P. longicarpus breeding season occurs from late March until October with the peak breeding in April. The main period of reproduction in the species occurs during the spring. Male hermit crabs will compete with other males for available females during breeding season. P. longicarpus, like many crustaceans, performs precopulatory mate-guarding behaviors, where males will grasp ahold of the female’s shell once the female releases a pheromone signaling sexual maturity.Minouchi, S. & Goshima, S. (1998). Effect of Male / Female Size Ratio on Mating Behavior of the Hermit Crab Pagurus Filholi (Anomura: Paguridae) Under Experimental Conditions. Journal of Crustacean Biology, 18(4), 710–716. Male and female crabs can be differentiated based on their pleopod morphology. Males have two pleopods, while females have three branching pleopods where her eggs are attached.Johnson, R., & Ebersole, J. (1989). Seasonality in the Reproduction of the Hermit Crab Pagurus longicarpus Say, 1817 (Decapoda, Paguridea). Crustaceana, 57(3), 311-313. P. longicarpus have sexual internal fertilization and must exit their shells in order to mate. After fertilization, the female houses the eggs inside her shell where they grow and develop. Larvae are later released into the surrounding ocean where they undergo several planktonic growth stages before developing into adult hermit crabs.

Formerly a major shopping street, it runs from Connolly station and the International Financial Services Centre at Amiens Street in the east to Marlborough Street in the west. The street is named after Charles Chetwynd- Talbot, 2nd Earl Talbot, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, 1817–21. One of the street's most famous residents was Alfie Byrne, ten times Lord Mayor of Dublin.  Streetscape  Talbot House, the offices for the Department of Education, is one of a number of significant buildings. To the east, a street renewal programme has improved the area close to Connolly Station. The editorial offices of the Irish Independent newspaper have relocated to Talbot Street and the presence of a number of financial institutions such as Irish Life & Permanent Plc. and Bank of Ireland have also helped to raise the profile of the street which traditionally has not enjoyed the same level of commercial success as Henry Street to the west of nearby O'Connell Street. The vista looking east along Talbot Street is closed by the impressive edifice of Dublin Connolly Railway Station at Amiens Street with its distinctive Italianate tower at its centre. The station is named in honour of Irish Socialist leader, James Connolly, leader of the Easter Rising in 1916 when commander of the Irish Citizen Army. A statue of Connolly has also been raised in nearby Beresford Place, opposite Liberty Hall, headquarters of SIPTU (Services, Industrial, Professional & Technical Union), the largest trades union in Ireland. The street is a one-way street from going east to west from Amiens Street to Marlborough Street.  History  Seán Tracey Commemorative plaque in Dublin's Talbot Street The front of the memorial erected in Talbot Street to commemorate the 33 victims of the 1974 Dublin and Monaghan bombings In October 1920 republican Seán Treacy (also spelt Tracey) of Tipperary was shot and killed outside the Republican Outfitters shop at number 94, having been spotted by British agents on clandestine patrol in the vicinity. A plaque of remembrance marks the spot and is the focus of an infrequent commemoration attended by large numbers of Tipperary people on the morning of the All- Ireland Hurling Final in years when the Tipperary team participate, thus underlying the close association of the Gaelic Athletic Association with Irish nationalism. In the 1930s, 40s and 50s there were a number of attempts to change the name of Talbot street to Seán Treacy street. In 1943, the Dublin Corporation passed a motion urging a change of name subject to the support of the majority of rentpayers on Talbot Street. However, the rentpayers of the street voted not to rename the street. Another horrific event, (part of the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings) of even greater proportions occurred in Talbot Street on 17 May 1974 where one of three car bombs allegedly planted by the loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) exploded outside a shoe shop opposite Guineys near the Lower Gardiner Street intersection, killing 13 women and one man. Nobody has been charged with the bombings, despite a campaign of nearly 40 years to find the perpetrators.

Established in 1838 (first service on Sunday 4th of November 1838), its ethos was Calvinistic Methodism, and was affiliated to the Anglesea circuit.Welsh Chuch Talbot Streat Features, Draig Werdd - the Welsh Society in Ireland. The Church was often referred to as the Welch Church, Welsh Methodist Church, Welsh Orthodox Church or Welsh Presbyterian Church. An early Chaplain was Rev. William Griffiths. Rev. John Owen served as chaplain from 1885 until 1894. Rev. John Lewis was the churches minister from 1894 to 1934, he tutored the politician Ernest Blythe, who attended services to study Welsh (as did other members of the Gaelic League. It was decided to close at a meeting in December 1938, and sold in 1944, with proceeds going to churches in Anglesey. The building has subsequently been a Shoe shop(Griffiths), a snooker hall, an arcade and an Internet Cafe.

In 1916, the name was changed to the Toy Cannon Works. In 1924, the company changed names again, to The Conestoga Company, Inc. An assistant professor from the same physics department at Lehigh was the company founder and owner until 1955. The Conestoga Company manufactures nineteen models of Big-Bang Cannon in Allentown, Pennsylvania, Lehigh County. A bombing plane, tank, boat and pistol were manufactured during the 1920s, firing on the same principle as the cannons. 1930s designs included a Giant Roller Coaster, Ro- To-Top, Spinning Top, Field Glasses and G-Gun.1929 Toy World Ad Repurposed for toymaking, the historic 4-story wood and brick plant is depicted in T. M. Fowler's 1894 \\"aerial\\" drawing of West Bethlehem, with ground floor access both from Connestoga St. on the 1st level, and from 1st Ave. at the 4th level. All machinery on the first three levels were driven by a single electric motor via belts and drive shafts the width of the building. In the mid 1950s, the plant burned, and operations were terminated. Dormant several years, the company was bought from physicist & founder Doc Wiley by brothers Frank H. & Robert E. Miller, who rehired Joseph Gombotz as plant manager and future owner. Taken by eminent domain in the late 1960s to construct the 4-lane spur route I-378, the plant moved to E. Goepp St, until its present owners moved it to Sumner Ave. in Allentown. [History in this paragraph provided by Robert E. Miller III.] Operation Calcium carbide was one of the first products of electric arc furnaces, made economical by Niagara Falls in 1888. After cooling, irregular chunks were packed in air-tight containers for sale and used to generate acetylene gas by slowly dropping water on them. Small carbide lamps were (and still are) used by miners to produce a very bright flame; larger versions were used on early buses & cars. These toys operate by introducing a little carbide into a chamber containing some water where it reacts immediately to release acetylene gas. A few seconds later (long enough for the gas to spread out in the chamber, but short enough for it not to be lost out the barrel), it is ignited. A means for introducing fresh air for the next explosion is also provided. Acetylene in air has the widest range of explosive limit of any common chemicalsee the explosive limit table and also a very low ignition energy, a combination which very reliably produces a loud “bang” explosion compared to other vapor explosions. The original 1907 “Gas Gun” patent does not claim novelty for the idea of using carbide-produced acetylene to produce explosions in a toy; rather it was the combination of a gas generator, ignition means, and various parts which were cheap to manufacture. That model used battery-operated spark-coil ignition; widely sold mid-century models created a spark as modern lighters do using ferrocerium. Another key feature of these devices as toys, is that acetylene explosions, compared to gunpowder, were much safer. The low density of the acetylene/air mixture is such that the total combustion energy is quite low and there is no recoil and little stress on the chamber holding the explosion, even if the outlet barrel was partly blocked. The original toys were brittle cast iron; the company even demonstrated cannons made of glass to show that there was no likelihood of dangerous fracture. Deliberately adding too much carbide does not increase the energy of the explosion but instead weakens it. Since a means for producing a consistent gas charge was important, a special granulated form (about 1 mm grains) of calcium carbide was trademarked as Bangsite in 1952. It could be easily metered in a dispensing mechanism, and promotional materials emphasized that Bangsite was difficult to abuse by hammering, lighting with a match and other things young boys might try.

Early life Biddulph was the son of Sir Theophilus Biddulph, 1st Baronet and Susanna Highlord, Michael Biddulph. He was educated at St Paul's School and Christ's College, Cambridge. On 31 December 1673, he married Henrietta Maria Witley, daughter of Colonel Richard Witley, in Westminster Abbey in London. He succeeded to his father's baronetcy in April 1683. Career Biddulph stood for Parliament at Lichfield at a by-election of 1678,but was defeated in a hard-fought and costly contest. He was returned as Member of Parliament (MP) for Lichfield at the two general elections of 1679 and at the 1681 English general election. He did not stand at the 1685 English general election, but gave his interest to Thomas Orme. He regained his seat at the 1689 English general election but lost it again at the 1690 English general election. He was returned again as MP for Lichfield at the 1695 English general election and signed the Association in February 1696. He voted to fix the price of guineas at 22 shilling in March 1696 and for the attainder of Sir John Fenwick on 25 November 1696. On 7 March 1697 or 1698 Biddulph married as his second wife Elizabeth D'Oyly, daughter of William D'Oyly. He built and lived at Elmhurst Hall just north of Lichfield during his time as MP for the city. Biddulph was returned again in a contest at the 1698 English general election but was defeated at the first general election of 1701. He was returned again at the second general election of 1701. Biddulph had stood surety for his wife's cousin Morgan Whitley, who had been appointed receiver general of Cheshire and North Wales. In January 1702, Whitley was found to be owing the Crown a total debt of £43,000, and by February 1702 Biddulph was facing severe financial penalties on account of Whitley's failures. When he was returned at the 1702 English general election, he was in prison at Stafford, presumably on account of his debts. He was able to obtain release from prison, but had to keep a low profile to avoid being detained again. He voted with the Whigs in Parliament in February 1703 but was in prison again by September, after which he was released again. His estates, in which he only held a life interest, were taken over by the Crown, but his time in prison had been detrimental to his health. Eventually an act of Parliament was passed to allow the Lord Treasurer to compound with him for the debt and the marriage of Biddulph's son provided sufficient funds to cover it. He did not stand at the 1705 English general election, but was returned again as a Whig at the 1708 British general election. He was an inactive Member and did not stand in 1710. Death and legacy Biddulph died on 20 April 1718, and was buried in Greenwich in Kent on 1 May 1718. He had two daughters and a son, Theophilus, by his first wife, and three daughters by his second wife. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his son Theophilus Biddulph.

In addition to refusing food, fasting girls claimed to have special religious or magical powers. The ability to survive without nourishment was attributed to some saints during the Middle Ages, including Catherine of Siena and Lidwina of Schiedam, and regarded as a miracle and a sign of sanctity. Numerous cases of fasting girls were reported in the late 19th century. Believers regarded such cases as miraculous. Saturday, September 26, 2020 In some cases, the fasting girls also exhibited the appearance of stigmata. Doctors, however, such as William A. Hammond ascribed the phenomenon to fraud and hysteria on the part of the girl.Blustein, Bonnie Ellen. (1991). Preserve Your Love for Science: Life of William A Hammond, American Neurologist. Cambridge University Press. p. 197. Historian Joan Jacobs Brumberg believes the phenomenon to be an early example of anorexia nervosa. Mollie Fancher Mary J. \\"Mollie\\" Fancher (August 16, 1848 – February, 1916), otherwise known as the \\"Brooklyn Enigma\\", was extremely well known for her claim of not eating or eating very little for extended periods of time. She attended a reputable school and, by all reports, was an excellent student. At age 16, she was diagnosed with dyspepsia. At around the age of 19, reports came out that she had abstained from eating for seven weeks. It was after two accidents, in 1864 and 1865, that she became famous for her ability to abstain from food. As a result of the accidents, Mollie Fancher lost her ability to see, touch, taste, and smell. She claimed to have powers that involved her being able to predict events as well as to read without the ability of sight. By the late 1870s, she was claiming to eat little or nothing at all for many months. Her claim to abstinence from food lasted for 14 years. Doctors and people in the public began to question her abilities and wished to perform tests to determine the truthfulness of her claims. The claims to abstinence were never verified and she died in February 1916.Brumberg, Fasting Girls pp. 78–85  Sarah Jacob  Sarah Jacob. A case that led to a death and arrests was that of Sarah Jacob (May 12, 1857 – December 17, 1869), the \\"Welsh fasting girl\\", who claimed not to have eaten any food at all after the age of ten. A local vicar, initially skeptical, became convinced that the case was authentic and Jacob enjoyed a long period of publicity, during which she received numerous gifts and donations from people who believed she was miraculous. Doctors were becoming increasingly skeptical about her claims and eventually proposed that she be monitored in a hospital environment to see whether her claims about fasting were true. In 1869, her parents agreed for a test to be conducted under strict supervision by nurses from Guy's Hospital. The nurses were instructed not to deny Jacob food if she asked for it, but to see that any she received was observed and recorded. After two weeks, she was showing clear signs of starvation. The vicar told the parents that she was failing and that the nurses ought to be sent away so that she could get food. The parents refused and continued to refuse even when informed that their daughter was dying, insisting that they had frequently seen her like this before and that lack of food had nothing to do with her symptoms. Jacob died of starvation a few days later and it was found that she had actually been consuming very little amounts of food secretly, which she could no longer do under medical supervision.A Continuation of the Case of the Welsh Fasting Girl The British Medical Journal.

The Sydney Morning Herald: p. 3\\\\. (Reprinted from The Observer). Other fasting girls Another case was that of New Jersey's Lenora Eaton in 1881. Reputable citizens in Eaton's town promoted her as someone who had \\"lived without eating\\". During these times, Eaton was marked as a \\"special person and symbol of faith in the miraculous\\". When these claims were investigated and doctors were sent to help her, Eaton continued to refuse to eat and died after forty-five days.Brumberg, Fasting Girls, p. 92 In 1889, the Boston Globe ran a story, \\"Who Took the Cold Potato? Dr. Mary Walker Says the Fasting Girl Bit a Doughnut.\\"\\"Who Took the Cold Potato? Dr. Mary Walker Says the Fasting Girl Bit a Doughnut.\\" The Boston Daily Globe, April 9, 1889, p. 8 Dr. Walker reported that Josephine Marie Bedard, known as the Tingwick girl, was a fraud. The evidence was circumstantial: \\"At the hotel I searched her clothing and found in one of her pockets a doughnut with a bite taken out of it.... On Fast day I had a lunch served to me... I left a platter with three pieces of fried potato on it. I went there and one of the pieces was gone... when I returned, Josephine had her handkerchief to her mouth.\\" Asked whether that was all the evidence, she said, \\"after I accused her of it she broke down and cried.\\" Because fasting girls were such a curiosity in the Victorian era, many companies and individuals rushed to put them on display. In the case of Josephine Marie Bedard, two different Boston-based enterprises, the Nickelodeon and Stone and Shaw's museum, competed in court for the right to \\"exhibit the girl\\" publicly. Still, even as she was used for blatant commercial gain, there was also an element of scientific inquiry in regarding Bedard as a medical phenomenon. While a modern institutional review board would not have approved the violation of privacy for these young women for commercial gain, the practice was allowed in the Victorian era as demonstrated in the examples.

He was Rocco Perri's lawyer. Bell attended Hamilton Collegiate Institute and Trinity College, University of Toronto. He was called to the bar in 1899, after studies at Osgoode Hall. He practiced law in Toronto before moving back to Hamilton, and worked for a couple of local law firms before setting up his own firm, Bell & Yates. Before 1930 he defended thirteen men on murder charges and all were acquitted. In the mid-1930s he defended David Meisner, accused of kidnapping London Beer Tycoon John Labatt. Despite a valiant effort by Bell (he only charged $400, most of which went to research and getting witnesses to come from the States - he was left with less than $125) to prove Meisner's innocence, the jury found him guilty and the judge sentenced him to 15 years in the Kingston Penitentiary in Ontario. Bell maintained that Meisner was innocent, and wrongly accused, even writing a book about it: \\"Who Said Murder?\\" published by Macmillan in Toronto in 1935. It was later found that Meisner was innocent, and he was acquitted.Goldenberg, Susan. Snatched! The Peculiar Kidnapping of Beer Tycoon John Labatt. Toronto: The Dundurn Group, 2004. He entered the world of politics and represented Hamilton West as a Conservative candidate in the 1925 Dominion election and won with a majority of 12,000 votes. Elected again in 1926 and 1930 and stepped down in 1935 due to the death of his son, Kenneth Clifford in an auto accident. He also enjoyed the theatre and became a playwright for a number of comedic plays. Bell's first successful play was Her First Divorce, which opened at the Comedy Theater on Broadway in New York in May 1913. His most successful play was Parlor, Bedroom and Bath, which opened in 1917 and ran for 232 performances. The play was twice made into a film, the first time in 1920, and again in 1931 starring Buster Keaton. Combining law and theatre came naturally for he believed that watching an audience's reaction to his plays helped him to judge the character of witnesses in court. Bell would write in the morning before going to court or his law offices. Bell was also a member of All Saints' Anglican Church and former Prime Minister Arthur Meighen was an honorary pallbearer at his funeral in 1938. Bell was buried in Woodland Cemetery.

From the age of ten, she was said to have gone without food for long periods but without any apparent effect on her health. Her parents began to receive visitors and to display the child to them, claiming that she had not eaten for many months; by the time she died, she was said to have gone without food for a total of 113 weeks. When the news of her supposed fasting reached the national press, an article on the subject was published in The Lancet, and eventually a team of four nurses was sent to the house to observe her and see whether she was secretly eating and drinking. They began their observations on 9 December 1869, and the girl died just over a week later. During the period the nurses were present, no one attempted to feed her.Robert Fowler, M.D., A Complete History of the Case of the Welsh Fasting-Girl (Sara Jacob) with Comments thereon and Observations on Death from Starvation, London, 1871 (London, 1871).

It is a dual-function enzyme with two GH31 domains, one serving as the isomaltase, the other as a sucrose alpha-glucosidase. It has preferential expression in the apical membranes of enterocytes. The enzyme’s purpose is to digest dietary carbohydrates such as starch, sucrose and isomaltose. By further processing the broken-down products, energy in the form of ATP can be generated.Berg, J. M. et al. Biochemistry, 7th Ed. W.H. Freeman and Company: New York, 2012.  Structure  Key residues that interact with substrate where turquoise residues correspond to interactions with Man2GlcNAc2, pink residues correspond to interactions with kotalonal, and magenta residues corresponds to interactions with both Man2GlcNAc2 and kotalonal. Generated from 3LPO Sucrase-isomaltase consists of two enzymatic subunits: sucrase and isomaltase. The subunits originate from a polypeptide precursor, pro-SI. By heterodimerizing the two subunits, the sucrase- isomaltase complex is formed. The enzyme is anchored in the intestinal brush border membrane by a hydrophobic segment located near the N-terminal of the isomaltase subunit. Before the enzyme is anchored to the membrane, pro-SI is mannose-rich and glycosylated; it moves from the ER to the Golgi, where it becomes a protein complex that is N- and O- glycosylated. The O-linked glycosylation is necessary to target the protein to the apical membrane. In addition, there is a segment that is both O-linked glycosylated and Ser/Thr- rich. A similarly-arranged enzyme is the maltase-glucoamylase, also a member of GH31. Sucrase-isomaltase is composed of duplicated catalytic domains, N- and C-terminal. Each domain displays overlapping specificities. Scientists have discovered the crystal structure for N-terminal human sucrase-isomaltase (ntSI) in apo form to 3.2 Å and in complex with the inhibitor kotalanol to 2.15 Å resolution. Sucrase-isomaltase’s mechanism results in a net retention of configuration at the anomeric center. The crystal structure shows that sucrase-isomaltase exists as a monomer. The researchers claim that the observance of SI dimers is dependent on experimental conditions. ntSI’s four monomers, A, B, C, and D are included in the crystal asymmetric unit and have identical active sites. The active site is composed of a shallow-substrate binding pocket including -1 and +1 subsites. The non-reducing end of substrates binds to the pocket. While the non-reducing sugar ring has interactions with the buried -1 subsite, the reducing ring has interactions with the surface exposed +1 subsite. The interactions between the active site of sucrase-isomaltase and the following compounds have been identified: * Man2GlcNAc2 glycan: Within the active site, Man2GlcNAc2 hydrogen bonds with hydroxyl side chains of Asp231 and Asp571. Furthermore, hydrophobic interactions with Leu233, Trp327, Trp435, Phe479, Val605, and Tyr634 provide additional stabilization for Man2GlcNAc2. * Kotalonal, the inhibitor: It interacts with the catalytic nucleophile Asp472 and acid base catalyst Asp571. In addition, ntSI residues His629, Asp355, Arg555, Asp231, Trp435, and Phe479 bind to the substrate. Currently, there are no crystal structures of ntSI in complex with an α-1,6-linked substrate or inhibitor analogue. In order to predict isomaltose binding in sucrase-isomaltase structure, a model was produced by hand. Within the -1 subsite, isomaltose’s non-reducing glucose ring was aligned to that of acarbose. Not only has the structure of human sucrase-isomaltase been studied, but also sucrase-isomaltase’s structure in sea lions and pigs have also been analyzed.  Disease relevance  A deficiency is responsible for sucrose intolerance. Congenital sucrase- isomaltase deficiency (CSID), also called genetic sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (GSID), and sucrose intolerance, is a genetic, intestional disorder that is caused by a reduction or absence of sucrase and isomaltase Explanations for GSID include: * Mutations C1229Y and F1745C, which are present in the sucrase domain of SI, block SI path to anchor in the cell’s aprical membrane but does not impact protein folding or isomaltase activity. * Substitution of a cysteine by an arginine at amino acid residue 635 in the isomaltase subunit of SI was present in the cDNA encoding for a patient with CSID. SIC635R had an altered folding pattern, which influenced the sorting profile and increased the turnover rate. * A factor that can be attributed to congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency is the retention of SI in the cis- Golgi. This inability to transport is a result of a glutamine to proline substitution at amino acid residue 1098 of the sucrase subunit.

Bowen was one of the most controversial mayors in the history of the American capital, because of his outspoken support of emancipation and racial integration. Bowen was born in Scipio, New York in 1813. He married Mary Baker in 1835 and moved with her to Washington, D.C. to begin business as a merchant. President James K. Polk appointed Bowen to a clerkship in the Treasury Department in 1845, but revoked the appointment three years later when Bowen gained the reputation of a radical for distributing abolitionist propaganda; additionally, he supported Freesoil candidate Martin Van Buren in that year's presidential election rather than Polk's preferred successor, Lewis Cass. For the next six years Bowen prosecuted claims against the U.S. government, then became a founder of, and staunch activist for, the new Republican Party.Belva Lockwood And The 'Way Of The World' Upon his inauguration as President in 1861, Abraham Lincoln appointed Bowen as Police Commissioner for the District of Columbia, beginning the latter's career in city politics. The following year he became Tax Collector for the District, and in 1863 was appointed the D.C. postmaster. In 1868, Bowen was nominated by the Republicans as a candidate for Mayor of Washington against Democrat John T. Given. At that time, post-Civil War Washington had been ravaged by the war and by a desperate shortage of funds from Congress; the city had deteriorated so badly that there was much talk in the Federal sector of relocating the seat of government to St. Louis. Bowen ran for mayor under the slogan \\"A vote for Bowen is a vote for keeping the capital in Washington.\\" In that year's July election, blacks voted in Washington for the first time, and because of Bowen's famous support of civil rights, he received narrow support from white voters and overwhelming support from black ones. The margin was extremely narrow in favor of Bowen, but close enough to necessitate a recount by the City Councils; however, while it was still proceeding, the Republicans on the recount committee (including the most powerful Republican politician in the District, Alexander Robey Shepherd) publicly declared Bowen the winner and he took office. Once elected, however, Bowen's activism startled even the Radical Republican contingent that then dominated Congress. He agitated for complete integration of the city's public school system. When that failed, he turned instead to constructing a network of schools specifically for \\"persons of color,\\" diverting large sums of city funds and even providing $20,000 of his own. Bowen's policies of activism on behalf of black civil rights outraged well-to-do white citizens of Washington, but even the Republicans who had enforced black rights and suffrage in the capital concluded that Bowen was far more interested in civil rights for blacks than in governing the city and administering public services. He spent extravagant portions of the city budget in creating schools and employment for blacks, which, while regarded as noble by the Republicans, drained the coffers of money that was intended for maintaining the city. Bowen was even charged with reducing street service to men using penknives to cut the grass between the cobblestones on Pennsylvania Avenue.Free forum hosting - phpbbplanet.com By 1870, the city's debt had increased by 33 percent over its total two years before. Bowen was universally blamed, enough so that his furniture was seized in a judgement to try to replenish Washington's funds. Although he sought reelection that year, Republicans united with Democrats to vote overwhelmingly for his opponent, Matthew Gault EmeryTindall, William. Standard History of the City of Washington. Knoxville: H.W. Crew & Co., 1914, p.231. After leaving office, Bowen served as president of the Freedmen’s Aid Society, and as a member of the board of trustees of colored schools of Washington and Georgetown. He died in 1896 and was interred at Congressional Cemetery. In 1902, the Sayles J. Bowen school, at 3rd and K SW, was built and named in his honor. It was later closed and demolished and in 1961 the Southwest Neighborhood Library was built on the site of the school. References Mayors of Washington, D.C.

Retrieved 1 September 2019 also known as Gypsy Dave, was an English sculptor and songwriter. He was first in the public eye as the companion to the singer- songwriter, Donovan. He was also a well-known sculptor with studios in Greece and Thailand. Early years Mills was born in Peckham Rye, London, before moving to Hertfordshire. In his early days in Hertfordshire he became friends with many art students, including Dave Richards, Julian McAllister and Donovan. In 1963 he made a pivotal journey to St. Ives, Cornwall with Donovan.Donovan interviews musicOMH.com; accessed 11 March 2016.Donovan Discs – Links , donovandiscs.com; accessed 11 March 2016. He lost touch with Donovan and moved around the UK including Manchester and Nottingham. In late 1964 Donovan had been signed up to a record label and asked Mills to accompany him on his first tour with his other friends Mac MacLeod and John Lock. Donovan wrote \\"To Try for the Sun\\" and \\"Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)\\" about his time with Mills. Mills was tour manager for Donovan for many years, and appeared alongside Donovan in the TV film, A Boy Called Donovan. In 1968 they both journeyed to be with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and The Beatles at Rishikesh, India. Mills wrote a few songs which appeared on Donovan's album, The Hurdy Gurdy Man. The uncredited tracks \\"A Sunny Day\\" and \\"The River Song\\" according to BMI records were collaborations with Donovan, but the song \\"Tangier\\" was written solely by Mills under its original title of \\"In Tangier Down a Windy Street\\".Donovan songs, sabotage.demon.co.uk; accessed 11 March 2016.

Sculpture and beyond From 1968 to 1971 Mills studied sculpture including personal tuition with David Wynne. At this time he moved away from his music industry connections towards the visual arts. In the years that followed he restored a farm house and set up a studio on the Greek island of Paros. His works were exhibited in Gordons Gallery, Wimbledon; The Fulham Gallery, Fulham Road, London; Doves Gallery, Norwich, and The Welsh House Gallery, North Wales. In 1979 he wrote a children's book entitled Sandy Lea for which Rita Schmeiser provided the illustrations. The 1986 film Castaway with Oliver Reed and Amanda Donohoe used his song \\"Tangier\\" extensively. By 1997 Mills turned his attention back to sculpture, and became a well-respected artist and writer in Greece. Later years In 2006 Mills married his partner Pannee in Thailand, and finished building a school of sculpture and an artist's retreat. He was working on his autobiography and a few of his early adventures are to be found in Donovan's book The Hurdy Gurdy Man.

Neil Davis; published August 24, 1979; archived at the University of Alaska Fairbanks; retrieved August 18, 2011 is an infection that afflicts the fingers of seal hunters and other people who handle seals, as a result of bites or contact with exposed seal bones; it has also been contracted by exposure to untreated seal pelts. The State of Alaska Section of Epidemiology defines it as \\"a finger infection associated with bites, cuts, or scratches contaminated by the mouths, blood, or blubber of certain marine mammals\\". It can cause cellulitis, joint inflammation, and swelling of the bone marrow; untreated, the course of \\"seal finger\\" is slow and results often in thickened contracted joint.Seal Finger - An enigma and a challenge; State of Alaska Epidemiology Bulletin #17; published August 5, 1983; retrieved August 18, 2011. Historically, seal finger was treated by amputation of the affected digits once they became unusable. It was first described scientifically in 1907. The precise nature of the organism responsible for seal finger is unknown, as it has resisted culturing because most cases are promptly treated with antibiotics; however, as seal finger can be treated with tetracycline or similar antibiotics, the causative organism is most likely bacterial, or possibly fungal; in 1998, Baker, Ruoff, and Madoff showed that the organism is most likely a species of Mycoplasma called Mycoplasma phocacerebrale. This Mycoplasma was isolated in an epidemic of seal disease occurring in the Baltic Sea.

These models were provided by the Michigan Air National Guard 107th Fighter Squadron, which was then transitioning to the A-10 Thunderbolt II at the time. With the upgrade to the Block 30 aircraft, the tail code of the 163rd was changed from \\"FW\\" (Fort Wayne) to \\"IN\\" (Indiana) in 2009 when the 181st Fighter Wing at Hulman Field became a non- flying unit. However, only a few of the F-16s were re-coded. In 2009 – the year the unit honored its predecessor unit – the 358th FG – with a heritage jet – it was decided that the squadron was to retire their 20-year-old F-16s and become an A-10 Thunderbolt II squadron. The conversion happened in 2010.

The NOKR organization has volunteers in 50 US states and 87 countries. NOKR is the central depository for emergency contact information in the United States. The NOKR resource is used by more than 400 million registrants. In 2005, after Hurricane Katrina, Senator Barack Obama (now former US President) introduced the National Next of Kin Registry to the 109th United States Congress in S.1630, The National Emergency Family Locator Act. The Next of Kin Registry was referenced in this bill as a standard for the Secretary of Homeland Security to consider in establishing the National Emergency Family Locator System. In 2006 the American Red Cross partnered with the Next of Kin Registry.http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Partnerships+Help+With+Communication+During+Disaster.-a0147700406 The American Red Cross, along with many familiar partner agencies, such as FEMA, the United States Postal Service and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, wanted to ensure that families have a bevy of resources and options to use in order to communicate in times of disaster. In 2007 the US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) consulted with the Next of Kin Registry in an effort to answer HR5441 (Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2007), SEC. 689c. NOKR put forth the requested solution for the National Emergency Family Registry and Locator System (NEFRLS), which was established in compliance with Congressional legislation SEC. 689c of H.R. 5441 to help family members separated after major disasters to communicate with one another. Mark serves as the President of NOKR in Washington, D.C., a non-profit public benefit resource used globally by emergency agencies to reunify families when emergencies happen or national disasters occur.

De-novo synthesis starts with cytosolic carbamoylphosphate synthetase II which uses glutamine, carbon dioxide and ATP. This enzyme is inhibited by uridine triphosphate (feedback inhibition). In 2015, the first observed pathological mutations of CAD were found in a four-year-old boy. CAD protein has been observed in the mid-piece of mammalian spermatozoa, among the mitochondria.  Structure  CAD protein has a molecular weight of 243 KDa. It is a polypeptide made up of four different domains which make for a multi enzyme unit: Glutaminase (GLN), carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CPS II), Dihydroorotase (DHO) and aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATC). The protein assembles into ~1.5MDa hexamers. More specifically, the DHO domain assembles into dimers, and ATC domains do so into trimers. The hexamers are then formed by DHO dimerization of two ATC trimers, and this connection does not impact the kinetic properties. In addition, it is thought that three GLN-CPS II dimers border the DHO-ATC complex. This is suggested by the fact that CPS II is not stable unless a part of the complex. DHO and ATC and are thought to be the main part of the formation of the protein. The active site is covered by a carboxylated lysine, serving as a bridge for two zinc ions (+2 charge). Another zinc ion helps stabilize a histidinate ion. The zinc and lysine are involved in the activity of the enzyme.  Function  This protein starts and controls the creation of pyrimidines in animals by acting as an enzyme. CAD is known to perform multiple reactions. For example, GLN and CPS II create carbamoyl phosphate from bicarbonate, glutamine, and two ATP molecules. The ATC then takes the newly made carbamoyl phosphate and forms carbamoyl aspartate by reacting with aspartate. DHO then takes carbamoyl aspartate and converts it to dihydroorotate. This molecule is a precursor of a pyrimidine ring, and this process shows the CAD protein's function in pyrimidine synthesis through carbamoyl-phosphate synthase and dihydroorotase activity. In order to function, CAD requires certain co-factors. Zinc (+2) is needed for dihydroorotase activity, and thus three Zn+2 molecules bind to each subunit. Magnesium and manganese are also necessary, and either element is bound with four per subunit. The Michaelis-Menten constant, Km, shows the affinity of two molecules for one another. The Km of CAD for dihydroorotate is 28μM, and for N-carbamoyl-L-aspartate, it is 241μM.  Regulation  CAD protein is regulated by various molecules in order to increase or stop enzymatic activity. Uridine-5′-triphosphate (UTP) is an end product that allosterically inhibits the CPS II step through negative feedback. Additionally, UMP acts as an allosteric inhibitor to the CPS II reaction. On the other hand, this step is activated by 5-phosphoribosyl-α-pyrophosphate (PRPP), which is also a reactant for purine and pyrimidine synthesis. CAD activation can also occur by the addition of a phosphate group, done with S6 kinase, at the connection between DHO and ATC domains. CAD is also regulated in the mTOR pathway by mLST8, a protein that is part of the mTOR complex. More specifically, mTORC1 is a serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates CAD, increasing its activity.  Medical Implications  Congenital disorder of glycosylation, Type Iz is a rare disease caused by mutations in the CAD gene. This disease causes epileptic encephalopathy, normocytic anemia, anisopoikilocytosis, and a delay in childhood development. The disease is hereditary and autosomal recessive, and can be fatal in the early years of life. There is also potential use for CAD protein as a target for treating certain tumors, as its role in pyrimidine synthesis can be manipulated to destroy cancer cells that are always growing and in need of new nucleotides. CAD can also be enhanced in order to increase certain types of cancer cells to chemotherapy. This has been shown to be specifically helpful in the treatment of Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) in vitro and in vivo.

The series used scripts adapted from published novels and stories. Although not properly a horror series, it included several supernatural elements. Armchair Thriller was produced by Thames Television, but it included serials made by Southern Television. The format was of 25-minute episodes broadcast twice-weekly, usually screened on a Tuesday or Thursday between 8 pm and 9 pm.  Overview  The opening titles consisted of a shadow-figure walking to an armchair and then sitting down, accompanied by music composed by Andy MacKay of pop group Roxy Music. Some equally memorable trailers for the series showed the same armchair soaked in blood and a screaming, maniacal face; these received criticism from those who considered them too horrific for pre-watershed viewing. For Armchair Thriller broadcasts Thames Television changed the station ident it used; normally it showed a London landscape in daytime, but here it was the same view as though seen at night. The first series included an adaptation of Antonia Fraser's novel Quiet as a Nun. This introduced to television the character of Jemima Shore—who was later spun off into her own ITV series—and starred Maria Aitken. \\"Quiet as a Nun\\" proved to be particularly memorable, famous for the cliffhanger sequence where the 'Black Nun' appeared. Ratings increased, reaching a high of 17 million viewers during the broadcast of the first episode of \\"The Limbo Connection\\".A Television Heaven overview Other actors to appear included Ian McKellen and Denis Lawson.Armchair Thriller fansite Episodes=Series 1Series 2 DVD releases  The ten Thames-produced serials were released by Network in 2008, both as separate stories and as a collected box set.

The degree programmes in Theatre Arts Norwegian Theatre Academy offers two different study programs leading to a bachelor's degree, in acting and scenography respectively. Student exchange program The Norwegian Theatre Academy participates in international exchange programs. Entrance Entrance for both scenographers and performing artists is by audition. Generally speaking the application deadline is in March with consequent auditions in May each year. The actual dates are published on the Academy's website. The Norwegian Theatre Academy is exempted from the standard Norwegian university entrance requirements and acceptance is gained by assessment of artistic talent during audition, which means that anyone can apply. Because of the international profile there are no requirements for Norwegian language skills, though it is expected that non-Scandinavian students acquire an understanding of Norwegian during their course of studies. As it is a state funded institution successful candidates are not required to pay tuition fees. Research Norwegian Theatre Academy participates in the recently established Program for Research Fellowships in the Arts - a parallel to academic PhD programs that is one of the first of its kind in Europe. The scheme enables artistic research and development work of a high quality and successful candidates are considered qualified for the academic post of Senior Lecturer/Associate Professor. Candidates who have completed their arts education at the highest available level (normally MA) are given the opportunity for a three-year funded fellowship. Fellows are attached to one of the Norwegian educational institutions offering higher education in one or more of the creative and performing arts. The Norwegian Theatre Academy has hosted one of the first candidates to complete this program. Leadership Norwegian Theatre Academy is organized with a joint leadership - artistic and administrative. Since August 2011 the artistic leadership is shared between Serge von Arx and Karmenlara Ely.

Alfred Holmes BEM (1 February 1931 – 1 January 1994) was a Gibraltarian sergeant of the Gibraltar Regiment (now the Royal Gibraltar Regiment). He was a well remembered Officer-in-Charge of the Apes who held this position, caring for the Gibraltar Barbary macaques, for over 38 years. He described the macaques as \\"Gibraltar's greatest treasure\\". Early life Holmes was a second generation Gibraltarian, born in Gibraltar to Gibraltarian parents Arthur Frederick Holmes and Mercedes Carrara. His father had been previously married and fathered five children from that relationship. Following the death of his wife, he married Mercedes who was later to be Alfred's mother. Alfred was to be the only child out of that relationship as his mother died when he was just three years old. His father later remarried one final time, fathering a further five children, giving Alfred a total of ten half siblings. In 1954 he married Spanish domestic worker Leonor Corbacho Velasco, a young lady from Valverde del Fresno (Cáceres). They met in La Línea de la Concepción, the Spanish municipality on the other side of the Gibraltar–Spain border, where she resided at the time. They went on to have two children, Maria de las Mercedes in 1955 and Edward Maximo in 1962. Career Sgt. Alfred Holmes alongside two Gibraltar Barbary macaques, looking down on the city of Gibraltar. In the 1950s, Holmes enlisted in the Gibraltar Regiment where he later ascended to the rank of sergeant. He was appointed as a non-commissioned officer of Officer-in-Charge of the Apes. From 1913 to 1991 the Gibraltar Barbary macaques were the responsibility of the British Army, which appointed a non-commissioned officer from the Gibraltar Regiment as Officer-in-Charge of the Apes. Holmes took over responsibility for the macaques from Gunner William Portlock, becoming the first Gibraltarian with this charge. During his service, Sgt. Holmes fed, nursed, and guarded the monkeys, generally working to maintain their well-being. He knew all of the macaques by the names he himself had given them. They were mostly named after Governors, brigadiers and high-ranking officers as well as his children. Sgt. Holmes could communicate with the animals by means of eye signals and barely perceptible head movements which he would use to stop them from taking food offered to them by tourists. He would even take young orphaned monkeys to his wife to help rear at home. He would also take sick or injured monkeys to the Royal Naval Hospital where they would receive the exact medical treatment as an enlisted soldier. For his work with the macaques, he was best known locally by the nickname of \\"El de los monos\\" (). Sgt. Holmes' time in the job made him an authority on this group of Barbary macaques, with his knowledge being sought by various scientific studies on the monkeys from around the globe. Death In the early 1990s, Holmes was diagnosed with esophageal cancer, later traveling to London to undergo major abdominal surgery. The cancer eventually resulted in his death on 1 January 1994 at Old St. Bernard's Hospital in Gibraltar. His body now rests in a family grave together with his father, grandfather and various half siblings at North Front Cemetery, Gibraltar.

Reaction mechanism  CTP (cytidine triphosphate) synthetase catalyzes the last committed step in pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis: ATP + UTP + glutamine → ADP + Pi \\\\+ CTP + glutamate It is the rate-limiting enzyme for the synthesis of cytosine nucleotides from both the de novo and uridine salvage pathways. The reaction proceeds by the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of UTP on the 4-oxygen atom, making the 4-carbon electrophilic and vulnerable to reaction with ammonia. The source of the amino group in CTP is glutamine, which is hydrolysed in a glutamine amidotransferase domain to produce ammonia. This is then channeled through the interior of the enzyme to the synthetase domain. Here, ammonia reacts with the intermediate 4-phosphoryl UTP. left  Isozymes  Two isozymes with CTP synthase activity exist in humans, encoded by the following genes: * CTPS – CTP synthase 1 * CTPS2 – CTP synthase 2  Structure  Dimeric form of CTP synthase from Sulfolobus solfataricus (PDB code: 3NVA). Chain A is depicted in blue and Chain B in green. Active CTP synthase exists as a homotetrameric enzyme. At low enzyme concentrations and in the absence of ATP and UTP, CTP synthase exists as inactive monomer. As enzyme concentration increases, it polymerizes first to a dimer (such as the form shown to the left) and, in the presence of ATP and UTP, forms a tetramer. The enzyme contains two major domains, responsible for the aminotransferase and synthase activity, respectively. The amidotransferase domains are located away from the tetramer interfaces and are not affected by the oligomeric state. The ATP-binding site and CTP-binding site in the synthase domain are located at the tetramer interface. It is for this reason that ATP and UTP are required for tetramerization.  Regulation  CTP synthase is precisely regulated by the intracellular concentrations of CTP and UTP, and both hCTPS1 and hCTPS2 have been seen to be maximally active at physiological concentrations of ATP, GTP, and glutamine. The activity of human CTPS1 isozyme has been demonstrated to be inhibited by phosphorylation. One major example of this is phosphorylation of the Ser-571 residue by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) in response to low serum conditions. Additionally, Ser568 has been seen to be phosphorylated by casein kinase 1, inhibiting CTP synthase activity. CTP is also subject to various forms of allosteric regulation. GTP acts as an allosteric activator that strongly promotes the hydrolysis of glutamine, but is also inhibiting to glutamine- dependent CTP formation at high concentrations. This acts to balance the relative amounts of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides. The reaction product CTP also serves as an allosteric inhibitor. The triphosphate binding site overlaps with that of UTP, but the nucleoside moiety of CTP binds in an alternative pocket opposite the binding site for UTP. CTP synthase levels have been shown to be dependent on levels of the transcription factor Myc. In turn, CTP synthase activity is required for Myc related phenotypes. The glutamine analog DON has also been seen to act as an irreversible inhibitor, and has been used as an anti-cancer agent.  Filaments  CTP synthase has been reported to form filaments in several different organisms. These include bacteria (C. crescentus), yeast (S. cerevisiae), fruit flies (D. melanogaster) and human cells. These filamentous structures have been referred to as cytoplasmic rods and rings, cytoophidia (from the Greek \\"cyto\\" meaning cell and \\"ophidium\\" meaning serpent, due to the structures morphology) or simply CTP synthase filaments. It has been shown that filamentation downregulates or upregulates CTP synthase activity depending on the species. In Drosophila, only one of the CTP synthase isoform forms the filament. Since the discovery of this novel mode of enzyme regulation in CTP synthase, multiple other enzymes have been shown to exhibit similar characteristics, suggesting that this is an important and well conserved strategy for enzymatic regulation. CTP synthase remains a model enzyme for the study of filament formation.  Clinical significance  Upregulated CTP synthase activity has been widely seen in human and rodent tumors. Mutations in the CTP synthase have been seen to confer resistance to cytotoxic drugs such as cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell model of leukemia though such mutations were not found in human patients with ara-C resistance.

Complex aircraft finance (such as those schemes employed by airlines) shares many characteristics with maritime finance, and to a lesser extent with project finance. Private aircraft Financing for the purchase of private aircraft is similar to a mortgage or automobile loan. A basic transaction for a small personal or corporate aircraft may proceed as follows: #The borrower provides basic information about themselves and their prospective aircraft to the lender. #The lender performs an appraisal of the aircraft's value. #The lender performs a title search based on the aircraft's registration number, in order to confirm that no liens or title defects are present. In many cases, a title insurance policy is procured to protect against any undetected defects in title. #The lender then prepares documentation for the transaction: #*A security agreement, which establishes a security interest in the aircraft, so that the lender may repossess it in the event of default on the loan #*A promissory note, which makes the borrower responsible for any outstanding loan balance not covered by repossession of the aircraft #*If the borrower is deemed less credit-worthy, a surety from a third party (or from multiple third parties) #At closing, the loan documentation is executed and then funds and title are transferred. Commercial aircraft Aircraft are expensive. A Boeing 737-700, the type Southwest uses, is priced in 2008 USD in the range of $58.5–69.5 million (although very few airlines actually pay this much). Airlines also typically have low margins so very few airlines can afford to pay cash for all their fleet. Commercial aircraft, such as those operated by airlines, use more sophisticated leases and debt financing schemes. The three most common schemes for financing commercial aircraft are secured lending, operating leasing and finance leasing. However, there are other ways to pay for the aircraft:Airfinance Journal # Cash # Operating leasing and sale/leasebacks # Bank loans/finance leases # Export credit guaranteed loans # Tax leases # Manufacturer support # EETCs These schemes are primarily distinguished by tax and accounting considerations, particularly tax-deductible depreciation, interest and operating costs which can reduce tax liability for the operator, lessor and financier. In May 2016, lessors had a 42% share of the market. It was increasing til 2008 but has since stagnated, and should continue so if not for a rise an interest rates, a slowing of airlines' profits, an increase in lessors' share of new airliner deliveries, and market liberalization. Lessors could also increase their market share by including more start-up airlines, more older aircraft recycling, a change in views on residual values, and lower returns acceptance. Direct lending As described above for private aircraft, an airline may simply take out a secured or unsecured loan to buy a commercial aircraft. In such large transactions, a syndicate of banks may collectively provide a loan to the borrower. Because the cost of a commercial aircraft may be hundreds of millions of dollars, most direct lending for aircraft purchases is accompanied by a security interest in the aircraft, so that the aircraft may be repossessed in event of nonpayment. It is generally very difficult for borrowers to obtain affordable private unsecured financing of an aircraft purchase, unless the borrower is deemed particularly creditworthy (e.g. an established carrier with high equity and a steady cash flow). However, certain governments finance the export of domestically produced aircraft through the Large Aircraft Sector Understanding (LASU). This interstate agreement provides for financing of aircraft purchases at 120 to 175 points over prime rate for terms of 10 to 12 years, and the option to \\"lock in\\" an interest rate up to three months prior to taking out the loan. These terms are often less attractive for larger operators, which can obtain aircraft less expensively through other financing methods. By directly owning their aircraft, airlines may deduct depreciation costs for tax purposes, or spread out depreciation costs to improve their bottom line. For instance, in 1992, Lufthansa adjusted its accounting to depreciate aircraft over 12 years instead of 10 years; the resulting drop in depreciation \\"expenses\\" caused the company's reported profits to rise by DM392 million. JAL made a similar adjustment in 1993, causing the company's profits to rise by ¥29.6 million. On the other hand, prior to the advent of commercial aircraft leasing in the 1980s, privately owned airlines were highly vulnerable to market fluctuations due to their need to assume high levels of debt in order to purchase new equipment; leases offer additional flexibility in this area, and have made airlines increasingly less sensitive to cost and revenue fluctuations, although some sensitivity still exists. Operating leasing Commercial aircraft are often leased through a Commercial Aircraft Sales and Leasing (CASL) company, the two largest of which are International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) and GE Commercial Aviation Services (GECAS). Operating leases are generally short-term (less than 10 years in duration), making them attractive when aircraft are needed for a start-up venture, or for the tentative expansion of an established carrier. The short duration of an operating lease also protects against aircraft obsolescence, an important consideration in many countries due to changing noise and environmental laws. In some countries where airlines may be deemed less creditworthy (e.g. the former Soviet Union), operating leases may be the only way for an airline to acquire aircraft. Moreover, it provides the flexibility to the airlines so that they can manage fleet size and composition as closely as possible, expanding and contracting to match demand. Conversely, the aircraft's residual value at the end of the lease is an important consideration for the owner. The owner may require that the aircraft be returned in the same maintenance condition (e.g. post-C check) as it was delivered, so as to expedite turnaround to the next operator. Like leases in other fields, a security deposit is often required. One particular type of operating lease is the wet lease, in which the aircraft is leased together with its crew. Such leases are generally on a short-term basis to cover bursts in demand, such as the Hajj pilgrimage. Unlike a charter flight, a wet-leased aircraft operates as part of the leasing carrier's fleet and with that carrier's airline code, although it often retains the livery of its owner. US and UK accounting rules differ regarding operating leases. In the UK, some operating lease expenses can be capitalized on the company's balance sheet; in the US, operating lease expenses are generally reported as operating expenses, similarly to fuel or wages. A related concept to the operating lease is the leaseback, in which the operator sells its own aircraft for cash, and then leases the same aircraft back from the purchaser for a periodic payment. The operating lease can afford the airlines flexibility to change their fleet size, and create a burden to the leasing companies. Finance leasing Finance leasing, also known as \\"capital leasing\\", is a longer-term arrangement in which the operator comes closer to effectively \\"owning\\" the aircraft. It involves a more complicated transaction in which a lessor, often a special purpose company (SPC) or partnership, purchases the aircraft through a combination of debt and equity financing, and then leases it to the operator. The operator may have the option to purchase the aircraft at the expiration of the lease, or may automatically receive the aircraft at the expiration of the lease. Under American and British accounting rules, a finance lease is generally defined as one in which the lessor receives substantially all rights of ownership, or in which the present value of the minimum lease payments for the duration of the lease exceeds 90% of the fair market value of the aircraft. If a lease is defined as a finance lease, it must be counted as an asset of the company, in contrast to an operating lease which only affects the company's cash flow. Finance leasing is attractive to the lessee because the lessee may claim depreciation deductions over the aircraft's useful life, which offset the profits from the lease for tax purposes, and deduct interest paid to those creditors who financed the purchase. This has made aircraft a popular form of tax shelter for investors, and has also made finance leasing a cheaper alternative to operating leases or secured purchasing. The various forms of finance leasing include: *Equipment trust certificate (ETC): Most commonly used in North America. A trust of investors purchases the aircraft and then \\"leases\\" it to the operator, on condition that the airline will receive title upon full performance of the lease. ETCs blur the line between finance leasing and secured lending, and in their most recent forms have begun to resemble securitization arrangements. *Extendible operating lease: Although an EOL resembles a finance lease, the lessee generally has the option to terminate the lease at specified points (e.g. every three years); thus, the lease can also be conceptualized as an operating lease. Whether EOLs qualify as operating leases depends on the timing of the termination right and the accounting rules applicable to the companies. *US leveraged lease: Used by foreign airlines importing aircraft from the United States. In a US lease, a Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC) purchases and leases the aircraft, and is tax- exempt so long as at least 50% of the aircraft is made in the US, and at least 50% of its flight miles are flown outside the US. Because of the extensive documentation required for these leases, they have only been used for very expensive aircraft being operated entirely outside the US, such as Boeing 747s purchased for domestic routes within Japan. *Japanese leveraged lease: A JLL requires the establishment of a special purpose company to acquire the aircraft, and at least 20% of the equity in the company must be held by Japanese nationals. Widebody aircraft are leased for 12 years, while narrowbody aircraft are leased for 10 years. Under a JLL, the airline receives tax deductions in its home country, and the Japanese investors are exempt from taxation on their investment. JLLs were encouraged in the early 1990s as a form of re-exporting currency generated by Japan's trade surplus. *Hong Kong leveraged lease: In Hong Kong, where income taxes are low in comparison to other countries, leveraged leasing to local operators is common. In such transactions, a locally incorporated lessor acquires an aircraft through a combination of non-recourse debt, recourse debt, and equity (generally in a 49-16-35 proportion), and thus be able to claim depreciation allowances despite only being liable for half of the purchase price. Its high tax losses can then be set off against profits from leasing the aircraft to a local carrier. Due to local tax laws, these investments are set up as general partnerships, in which the investors' liability is mainly limited by insurance and by contract with the operator.Johnson Stokes & Master, Legal Aspects Of Aircraft Finance In Hong Kong (March 18, 2005).  Corporate trust lease  Some U.S. banks hold an aircraft \\"in trust\\" to protect the privacy of the true \\"owners\\" of the aircraft or to \\"secure U.S. registration of aircraft for non-U.S. citizen corporations and individuals\\".

They use chemoreception in their environment and are found to be sessile and encrusting organisms. Microscopic particles released by prey are carried through the sea water and captured by the Atlantic Oyster Drill. This animal is not physically able to close itself from its surrounding environment because of its siphonal canal. This species is a serious problem in commercial oyster beds, and it has been accidentally introduced well outside its natural range. Distribution This snail is endemic to the Atlantic coast of North America, from Nova Scotia to Nassau Sound in in Florida. It has been accidentally introduced with oyster spat to Northern Europe and to the West Coast of North America from California to Washington.Abbott, R. Tucker, 1986. Seashells of North America, St. Martin's Press, New York. They range in areas with salinity and temperature changing seasonally and with the tidal currents. Habitat This species lives from low tide down to a depth of 25 feet. Its surroundings are rocky and shell beds. It inhabits the lower third of the littoral zone, therefore it is sheltered from any waves the ocean produces. Life habits As indicated by its common name, this predatory snail drills through the shells of living oysters and consumes them. Its surroundings are rocky and shell beds. It inhabits the lower third of the littoral zone, therefore it is sheltered from any waves the ocean produces. It selects its food of choice by the odor of the prey. Once he embraces the barnacle or mussel with his foot, he drills through the shell. It feeds on many different species of invertebrates. A few favorites are the barnacle Balanus balanoides and the mussel Mytilus edulis. Food supply is mainly found in intertidal areas in the Atlantic region. The Atlantic Oyster Drill finds its food by smell. They are found to be more responsive to living prey than to prey that has been killed recently in a lab. But there is still no preference when it comes to the prey species or age. Just like any other animal, ecological factors affect the growth of an individual. The type of food, amount of food, and the amount of time given for a species to grow are all important factors. Chloride and sodium, inorganic ions, are some of the major effectors of blood in marine and estuarine invertebrates, including the Atlantic oyster drill. They range in size, but male and female oyster drills average 24 millimeters and 28 millimeters, respectively. Not only are females longer, but they are also taller than their males. Almost all Atlantic oyster drills reach their largest size after two full growing seasons. About 70% of their size is reached within this time span. In the next four or so years to come, there is little or no increase in size anymore. Unfortunately, there is no protected way to check the sex of these gastropods. Their shell must be crushed in order to see the genitalia using a microscope. Although some females possess a small vestigial formation that may look like a penis, other parts are used to confirm the sex. Finding the egg capsule gland, ovary, and any sperm ingesting glands make it easier to identify the oyster drill as a female. Human relevance Due to their ability of \\"drilling\\" into shells, the destruction of their nature can cost millions of dollars every single year. This snail is a serious problem in commercial oyster farming: > \\"Next to the sea star, this snail is the worst enemy the ...

He served as a member of the burgh council of Edinburgh, then as Lord Provost, then as a Member of Parliament (MP) for the Edinburgh constituency. Life Born in Renton, Dunbartonshire, Duncan McLaren was the youngest of ten children of John McLaren and Catherine McLellan. Apart from two years of schooling, he was self-taught. After school, he was apprenticed to a merchant in Dunbar. In 1824, he set up his own business as a draper in Edinburgh. He became a member of the town council in 1833. He became treasurer in 1837 and found that the royal burgh's finances were in ruin and that the Scottish capital was bankrupt. His work extricated Edinburgh from financial ruin. In 1835, he pioneered free education for all classes and started a building programme of thirteen schools. He was elected Lord Provost of Edinburgh in 1851. McLaren was a Liberal and supported the anti–Corn Law campaign of John Bright, the opening of the Meadows to the public, and the establishment of the Industrial Museum (now the National Museum of Scotland). McLaren was also a governor of the Heriot Free School trust. In 1865 he was elected one of Edinburgh’s two Members of Parliament, a position he held until he retired 16 years later. At Westminster he proved a conscientious and intelligent representative, and acquired a position of so much authority on questions related to Scotland that he was called \\"Member for Scotland\\". He was then living in Newington House.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1865 Duncan McLaren was married three times - the third being Priscilla Bright (sister of John Bright and Margaret Bright Lucas), whom he married in 1848, and they lived together in Newington House, Edinburgh, from 1852 until his death in 1886. He is buried (together with most of his family) in St Cuthbert's Churchyard in the heart of Edinburgh. His huge monument lies against the east wall of the first south extension to the graveyard, immediately below Edinburgh Castle. Family McLaren married three times. Firstly, in 1829, he married Grant Aitken (1805-1833). Following her death he married Christina Gordon Renton (1813-1841). Finally, in 1848, he married Priscilla Bright (1815-1906), who outlived him by twenty years. All three wives are buried with him. He was the father of John McLaren (son of his first wife), Agnes McLaren, Katherine McLaren (mother of F. S.

Fossils of Megarachne have been discovered in deposits of Late Carboniferous age, from the Gzhelian stage, in San Luis, Argentina. The fossils of the single and type species M. servinei have been recovered from deposits that had once been a freshwater environment. The generic name, composed of the Ancient Greek μέγας (megas) meaning \\"great\\" and Ancient Greek ἀράχνη (arachne) meaning \\"spider\\", translates to \\"great spider\\", because the fossil was misidentified as a large prehistoric spider. With a body length of , Megarachne was a medium-sized eurypterid. If the original identification as a spider had been correct, Megarachne would have been the largest known spider to have ever lived. Eurypterids such as Megarachne are often called \\"sea scorpions\\", but the strata in which Megarachne has been found indicates that it dwelled in freshwater and not in marine environments. Megarachne was similar to other eurypterids within the Mycteropoidea, a rare group known primarily from South Africa and Scotland. The mycteropoids had evolved a specialized method of feeding referred to as sweep-feeding. This involved raking through the substrate of riverbeds in order to capture and eat smaller invertebrates. Despite only two specimens having been recovered, Megarachne represents the most complete eurypterid discovered in Carboniferous deposits in South America so far. Due to their fragmentary fossil record and similarities between the genera, some researchers have hypothesized that Megarachne and two other members of its family, Mycterops and Woodwardopterus, represent different developmental stages of a single genus.

Among them, the raised lunules (the vaguely moon-shaped ornamentation, similar to scales) and the cuticular sculpture of the mucrones (a dividing ridge continuing uninterrupted throughout the carapace, the part of the exoskeleton which covers the head) are especially important since these features are characteristic of eurypterids. Megarachne possessed blade-like structures on its appendages (limbs) which would have allowed it to engage in a feeding method known as sweep-feeding, raking through the soft sediment of aquatic environments in swamps and rivers with its frontal appendage blades to capture and feed on small invertebrates. Megarachne also possessed a large and circular second opisthosomal tergite (the second dorsal segment of the abdomen), the function of which remains unknown. Megarachne was very similar to other mycteroptid eurypterids in appearance, a group distinguished from other mycteropoids by the parabolic shape of their prosoma (the head plate), hastate telsons (the hindmost part of the body being shaped like a gladius, a Roman sword) with paired keel-shaped projections on the underside, and heads with small compound eyes that were roughly trapezoidal in shape. History of research alt=Outdated model of Megarachne as a large spider. Megarachne servinei was originally described in 1980 by the Argentinean paleontologist Mario Hünicken. The generic name, composed of the Ancient Greek μέγας (megas) meaning \\"great\\" and Latin arachne meaning \\"spider\\", translates to \\"great spider\\". The holotype (now stored at the Museum of Paleontology at the National University of Córdoba) was recovered from the Pallero Member of the Bajo de Véliz Formation of Argentina, which has been dated to the Gzhelian age, to million years ago. The specimen preserves the carapace, the first two tergites, three partial appendages and what is possibly a coxa (the proximalmost limb segment). Hünicken wrongly identified the specimen as a mygalomorph spider (the group that includes tarantulae) based on the shape of the carapace, the wide circular eye tubercle (round outgrowth) located in the center of the head between the two eyes and a circular structure behind the first body segment which he identified as the \\"moderately hairy\\" abdomen. Hünicken's identification relied heavily on X-ray microtomography of the holotype. Additional hidden structures – such as a sternum and labium, coxae and cheliceral fangs – were also extrapolated from the X-radiographs. With an estimated length of based on the assumption that the fossil was of a spider, and a legspan estimated to be , Megarachne servinei would have been the largest spider to have ever existed, exceeding the goliath birdeater (Theraphosa blondi) which has a maximum legspan of around . Because of its status as the \\"largest spider to have ever lived\\", Megarachne quickly became popular. Based on Hünicken's detailed description of the fossil specimen and various other illustrations and reconstructions made by him, reconstructions of Megarachne as a giant spider were set up in museums around the world. The identification of the specimen as a spider was doubted by some arachnologists, such as Shear and colleagues (1989), who stated that whilst Megarachne had been assigned to the Araneae, it \\"may represent an unnamed order or a ricinuleid\\". Even Hünicken himself acknowledged discrepancies in the morphology of the fossil that could not be accommodated with an arachnid identity. These discrepancies included an unusual cuticular ornamentation, the carapace being divided into frontal and rear parts by a suture and spatulate (having a broad, rounded end) chelicerae (already noted by Hünicken as a strange feature as no known spider possesses spatulate chelicerae), all features unknown in other spiders. However, the holotype was by then deposited in a bank vault so other paleontologists only had access to plaster casts. In 2005, a second, more complete specimen consisting of a part and counterpart (the matching halves of a compression fossil) was recovered, preserving parts of the front section of the body, as well as coxae possibly from the fourth pair of appendages, was recovered from the same locality and horizon. A research team led by the British paleontologist and arachnologist Paul A. Selden and also consisting of Hünicken and Argentinean arachnologist José A. Corronca reexamined the holotype in light of the new discovery. They concluded that Megarachne servinei was a large eurypterid (a group also known as \\"sea scorpions\\"), not a spider. Although Hünicken had misidentified Megarachne, his identification as an arachnid was not entirely absurd as the two groups are closely related. A morphological comparison with other eurypterids indicated that Megarachne most closely resembled another large Permo-Carboniferous eurypterid, the mycteroptid Woodwardopterus scabrosus which is known only from a single specimen. Selden and colleagues (2005) concluded that despite only being represented by two known specimens, Megarachne is the most complete eurypterid discovered in Carboniferous deposits in South America so far.  Classification  Cast of the holotype specimen of Megarachne exhibited at the alt=Cast of Megarachne's holotype specimen. Figure by alt=Drawing depicting the frontal parts of a fossil of Mycterops, a relative of Megarachne. Megarachne was part of the stylonurine suborder, a relatively rare clade of eurypterids. Within the stylonurines, Megarachne is a member of the superfamily Mycteropoidea and its constituent family Mycteropidae, which includes the close relatives Woodwardopterus and Mycterops. Fossilized remains of the second tergite of the mycteroptid Woodwardopterus were compared to the fossil remains of Megarachne by Selden and colleagues (2005), which revealed that they were virtually identical, including features previously not noted in Woodwardopterus, such as radiating lines covering the tergite. It was concluded that Megarachne and Woodwardopterus were part of the same family by Selden and colleagues (2005), with two primary differences; the tergites and the mucrones on the carapace are more sparsely packed in Megarachne and the protrusion of the anteroedian (i.e. before the middle) carapace, seen prominently in Megarachne, does not occur in Woodwardopterus. It has been suggested that three of the four genera that constitute the Mycteroptidae, Mycterops, Woodwardopterus and Megarachne, might represent different ontogenetic stages (different developmental stages of the animal during its life) of each other based on their morphology and the size of the specimens. Should this interpretation be correct, the sparse mucrones of Megarachne might be because of its age, as Megarachne is significantly larger than Woodwardopterus. The smallest genus, Mycterops, has even more densely packed ornaments on its carapace and tergite and might thus be the youngest ontogenetic stage of the animal. Should Mycterops, Megarachne and Woodwardopterus represent the same animal, the name taking priority would be Mycterops as it was named first, in 1886.Dunlop, J. A., Penney, D. & Jekel, D. 2018. A summary list of fossil spiders and their relatives. In World Spider Catalog. Natural History Museum Bern, p. 19 The cladogram below is adapted from Lamsdell and colleagues (2010) and shows the relationship of Megarachne within the suborder Stylonurina.  Paleoecology  alt=Size comparison of Megarachne and a human Both known specimens of Megarachne have been recovered from the Bajo de Véliz Formation of Argentina, dated to the Gzhelian stage of the Late Carboniferous. The environment of the Bajo de Véliz formation was, unlike the typical living environments of eurypterids (especially the swimming eurypterids of the suborder Eurypterina), a freshwater environment in a floodplain. Similar Late Carboniferous floodplains with fossilized remnants discovered in modern-day Australia suggest a flora dominated by different types of pteridosperms with pockets of isoetoid lycopsids. During Megarachne time, Argentina and the rest of South America was part of the ancient supercontinent Gondwana which was beginning to fuse with the northern continents of Euramerica, North China, Siberia and Kazakhstania to form Pangaea. In addition to Megarachne, the Bajo de Véliz Formation preserves a wide array of fossilized flying insects, such as Rigattoptera (classified in the order Protorthoptera), but as a freshwater predator, Megarachne would probably not have fed on them. Instead, the blades on the frontal appendages of Megarachne would have allowed it to sweep-feed, raking through the soft sediment of the rivers it inhabited in order to capture and feed on small invertebrates. This feeding strategy was common to other mycteropoids. In comparison to the comparatively warm climate of the earlier parts of the Carboniferous, the Late Carboniferous was relatively cold globally. This climate change likely occurred during the Middle Carboniferous due to falling levels in the atmosphere and high oxygen levels. The Southern Hemisphere, where Argentina was and still is located, may even have experienced glaciation with large continental ice sheets similar to the modern glacial ice sheets of the Arctic and Antarctica, or smaller glaciers in dispersed centers. The spread of the ice sheets also affected sea levels, which would rise and fall throughout the period. Late Carboniferous flora was low in diversity but also developed uniformly throughout Gondwana. The plant life consisted of pteridosperm trees such as Nothorhacopteris, Triphyllopteris and Botrychiopsis, and lycopsid trees Malanzania, Lepidodendropsis and Bumbudendron. The plant fossils present also suggest that it was subject to monsoons during certain time intervals.  In popular culture  During the production of the 2005 British documentary Walking with Monsters, Megarachne was slated to appear as a giant tarantula-like spider hunting the cat-sized reptile Petrolacosaurus in the segment detailing the Carboniferous, with the reconstruction closely following what was thought to be known of the genus at the time the series began production. The actual identity of the genus, as a eurypterid, was only discovered well into production and by then it was far too late to update the reconstructions. The scenes were left in, but the giant spider was renamed as an unspecified species belonging to the primitive spider suborder Mesothelae, a suborder that actually exists but with genera much smaller than, and looking considerably different from, the spider featured in the program.

It is one of the longest continually-running film series in history, having been in on-going production from 1962 to the present (with a six-year hiatus between 1989 and 1995). In that time Eon Productions has produced 25 films (including one due for release in 2021), most of them at Pinewood Studios. With a combined gross of over $7 billion to date, the films produced by Eon constitute the sixth-highest-grossing film series. Six actors have portrayed 007 in the Eon series, the latest being Daniel Craig. Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman co-produced most of the Eon films until 1975, when Broccoli became the sole producer. The single exception during this period was Thunderball, on which Broccoli and Saltzman became executive producers while Kevin McClory produced. From 1984 Broccoli was joined by his stepson Michael G. Wilson as producer and in 1995 Broccoli stepped aside from Eon and was replaced by his daughter Barbara, who has co-produced with Wilson since. Broccoli's (and until 1975, Saltzman's) family company, Danjaq, has held ownership of the series through Eon, and maintained co-ownership with United Artists since the mid-1970s. The Eon series has seen continuity both in the main actors and in the production crews, with directors, writers, composers, production designers, and others employed through a number of films. From the release of Dr. No (1962) to For Your Eyes Only (1981), the films were distributed solely by United Artists. When Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer absorbed United Artists in 1981, MGM/UA Entertainment Co. was formed and distributed the films until 1995. MGM solely distributed three films from 1997 to 2002 after United Artists was retired as a mainstream studio. From 2006 to 2015, MGM and Columbia Pictures co-distributed the film series, following the 2004 acquisition of MGM by a consortium led by Columbia's parent company, Sony Pictures. In November 2010, MGM filed for bankruptcy. Following its emergence from insolvency, Columbia became co-production partner of the series with Eon. Sony's distribution rights to the franchise expired in late 2015 with the release of Spectre. In 2017, MGM and Eon offered a one-film contract to co- finance and distribute the upcoming 25th film worldwide, which was reported on 25 May 2018 to have been won by Universal Pictures. The upcoming 25th film, officially titled No Time to Die, will be the first film in the franchise to be distributed by United Artists since Tomorrow Never Dies. Independently of the Eon series, there have been three additional productions with the character of James Bond: an American television adaptation, Casino Royale (1954), produced by CBS; a spoof, Casino Royale (1967), produced by Charles K. Feldman; and a remake of Thunderball entitled Never Say Never Again (1983), produced by Jack Schwartzman, who had obtained the rights to the film from McClory. First screen adaptation In 1954 the American CBS television network paid Ian Fleming $1,000 ($ in dollars) for the rights to turn his first novel, Casino Royale, into a one-hour television adventure as part of the dramatic anthology series Climax Mystery Theater, which ran between October 1954 and June 1958. It was adapted for the screen by Anthony Ellis and Charles Bennett; Bennett was well known for his collaborations with Alfred Hitchcock, including The 39 Steps and Sabotage. Due to the restriction of a one-hour play, the adapted version lost many of the details found in the book, although it retained its violence, particularly in Act III. The hour-long \\"Casino Royale\\" episode, which starred American actor Barry Nelson as Bond and Peter Lorre as the villain Le Chiffre, aired on 21 October 1954 as a live production. Eon Productions=Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman (1962–1964) In 1959 producer Albert R. \\"Cubby\\" Broccoli at Warwick Films expressed interest in adapting the Bond novels, but his colleague Irving Allen was unenthusiastic. In June 1961 Fleming sold a six-month option on the film rights to his published and future James Bond novels and short stories to Harry Saltzman, with the exception of Casino Royale, which he had previously sold. Towards the end of Saltzman's option period, screenwriter Wolf Mankowitz introduced him to Broccoli, and Saltzman and Broccoli formed Eon Productions with the intention of making the first Bond film. A number of Hollywood studios did not want to fund the films, finding them \\"too British\\" or \\"too blatantly sexual\\". Eventually the two signed a deal with United Artists for 100% financial backing and distribution of seven films, with financing of $1 million for the first feature. Saltzman and Broccoli also created the company Danjaq, which was to hold the rights to the films which Eon Productions was to produce. Eon had originally intended to film Fleming's novel Thunderball first, but Kevin McClory took Fleming to the High Court in London for breach of copyright over the book, and so Eon decided to film Dr. No first. =Dr. No (1962)= Eon asked several directors—Bryan Forbes, Guy Green, Val Guest and Guy Hamilton—to helm the film, but all declined, before Terence Young agreed. Eon had originally hired Wolf Mankowitz and Richard Maibaum to write Dr. Nos screenplay, partly because of Mankowitz's help in brokering the deal between Broccoli and Saltzman. An initial draft of the screenplay was rejected because the scriptwriters had made the villain, Dr. No, a monkey, and Mankowitz left the film. Maibaum then undertook a second version, more closely in line with the novel; Johanna Harwood and Berkely Mather then worked on Maibaum's script, with Harwood in particular being described as a script doctor credited with improving the British characterisations. To play the lead role of Bond, Sean Connery was not Broccoli or Fleming's first choice, but he was selected after Patrick McGoohan had turned down the role, and Eon had rejected Richard Johnson. After Connery was chosen, Terence Young took the actor to his tailor and hairdresser and introduced him to the high life, restaurants, casinos and women of London. In the words of Bond writer Raymond Benson, Young educated the actor \\"in the ways of being dapper, witty, and above all, cool\\". Filming took place on location in Jamaica between 16 January and 21 February 1962; five days later filming began at Pinewood Studios in England with sets designed by Ken Adam, who had previously worked with Broccoli on the 1960 film The Trials of Oscar Wilde. Maurice Binder created the title sequence and introduced the gun barrel motif that appears in all the Eon Bond films. Monty Norman wrote the accompanying soundtrack, which included the \\"James Bond Theme\\", heard in the gun barrel sequence and in a calypso medley over the title credits; the theme was described by another Bond film composer, David Arnold, as \\"bebop-swing vibe coupled with that vicious, dark, distorted electric guitar, definitely an instrument of rock 'n' roll ... it represented everything about the character you would want: It was cocky, swaggering, confident, dark, dangerous, suggestive, sexy, unstoppable. And he did it in two minutes\\". The theme was arranged by John Barry, who was uncredited for the arrangement but credited for his performance. =From Russia with Love (1963)= After the financial success of Dr. No, United Artists doubled the budget offered to Eon Productions to $2 million for the company's next film, From Russia with Love. The film was shot in Europe, which had turned out to be the more profitable market for Dr. No. Most of the crew from the first film returned, with major exceptions being production designer Ken Adam—who went to work on Dr. Strangelove and was replaced by Dr. Nos art director Syd Cain—and title designer Maurice Binder, who was replaced by Robert Brownjohn. John Barry composed the scores of 11 Bond films between 1963 and 1987. The original screenwriter for the film was Len Deighton, but he was replaced because of his slow progress. Two of the writers from Dr. No, Richard Maibaum and Johanna Harwood, were brought in, with Maibaum being given the sole writing credit and Harwood being credited for \\"adaptation\\". From Russia with Love is the first Bond film in the series with John Barry as the primary soundtrack composer, although Lionel Bart wrote the title song \\"From Russia with Love\\", sung by Matt Monro. Principal photography began on 1 April 1963 and concluded on 23 August. Filming took place in Turkey, Pinewood Studios and Venice, with Scotland and Switzerland doubling for the Orient Express journey through Eastern Europe. =Goldfinger (1964)= While the previous two films had concentrated on the Caribbean and Europe, Goldfinger was chosen by Eon for the third film, with the American cinema market in mind. Because Terence Young was refused a share of the profits, he declined to direct Goldfinger and worked on The Amorous Adventures of Moll Flanders instead, although he had done some pre-production work before he left. In his place, Eon turned to Guy Hamilton to direct; he was keen to inject elements of humour into the series, have more gadgets and build bigger and more elegant sets. Eon again turned to Richard Maibaum for the script, although Paul Dehn was later introduced for rewrites. After missing From Russia with Love, Ken Adam returned as production designer. Adam's imagination provided the idea of gold stacked upon gold behind iron bars for the scenes in the United States Bullion Depository. Saltzman disliked the design's resemblance to a prison, but Hamilton liked it enough that it was built. Robert Brownjohn returned to develop the opening credit sequence, which featured clips of all three Bond films projected on actress Margaret Nolan's body. Its design was inspired by seeing light projecting on people's bodies as they got up and left a cinema. Principal photography on Goldfinger started on in Miami, at the Fontainebleau Hotel; the crew was small, consisting only of Hamilton, Broccoli, Adam and cinematographer Ted Moore. After five days in Florida, production moved to England. The primary location was Pinewood Studios, home to sets including a recreation of the Fontainebleau, the South American city of the pre-title sequence, and both Goldfinger's estate and factory. Ian Fleming visited the set of Goldfinger in he died in August, shortly before the film's release. The second unit filmed in Kentucky, and these shots were edited into scenes filmed at Pinewood. Principal photography then moved to Switzerland for the car chase and additional footage for Goldfinger's factory sequence. Filming wrapped on at Andermatt, after nineteen weeks of shooting. Kevin McClory (1965) When writing his novels, Ian Fleming had always considered that they could be adapted for the cinema, and he approached producer Sir Alexander Korda to make a film adaptation of either Live and Let Die or Moonraker. Although Korda was initially interested, he later withdrew. On 1 October 1959, it was announced that Fleming would write an original film script featuring Bond for producer Kevin McClory. Jack Whittingham also worked on the script, culminating in a screenplay entitled James Bond, Secret Agent. However, Alfred Hitchcock and Richard Burton turned down roles as director and star, respectively. McClory was unable to secure the financing for the film, and the deal fell through. Fleming subsequently used the story for his novel Thunderball (1961), and McClory failed to have its publication stopped. On 19 November 1963 he took the matter to the Chancery Division of the High Court in the case of McClory v Fleming, but settled on 9 December 1963, after nine days in court. McClory gained the literary and film rights for the screenplay, while Fleming was given the rights to the novel, although it had to be recognised as being \\"based on a screen treatment by Kevin McClory, Jack Whittingham and the Author\\". =Thunderball (1965)= After From Russia with Love, Eon had considered undertaking an adaptation of either On Her Majesty's Secret Service or Casino Royale. They entered into negotiations with Charles K. Feldman, who held the rights to the latter, but a deal proved too difficult to achieve. Instead, Eon turned to the Thunderball novel. Although Eon had wanted to adapt the book in 1962, it had not been possible until the legal obstacles had been cleared. As a result of the settlement of the copyright infringement lawsuit brought by Kevin McClory, Eon negotiated with McClory to make Thunderball. McClory received the sole producer credit on the film, while Broccoli and Saltzman took the title Executive Producer, although \\"in reality all three men would essentially act as producers\\". Broccoli later said of the three-way partnership that \\"We didn't want anyone else to make Thunderball ... We had the feeling that if anyone else came in and made their own Bond film, it would have been bad for our series\\". Guy Hamilton was asked to direct again, but declined feeling that he was \\"drained of ideas ... I had nothing to contribute until I'd recharged batteries\\"; Terence Young returned to direct after the hiatus of Goldfinger. Richard Maibaum's original script from 1961 was used as the basis of the script, which he then re-drafted, with further revisions by John Hopkins. Principal filming began in Paris on 16 February 1965, and moved to Nassau on 22 March, before concluding at Pinewood Studios in May. With worldwide box office earnings of $141.2 million Thunderball became the highest-grossing instalment and retained the record until it was surpassed by The Spy Who Loved Me twelve years later; adjusted for inflation it remained the most successful entry until Skyfall was released in 2012. As part of the contract with Eon, McClory received 20% of the film's profits and undertook not to produce any other films based on the Thunderball story for a period of ten years following the release of the Eon-produced version in 1965. Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman (1967–1975) Roald Dahl, who wrote the script for You Only Live Twice =You Only Live Twice (1967)= After the interruption of McClory as producer, Albert Broccoli and Harry Saltzman returned to production once again. The first four Bond films had been popular in Japan, and Eon decided to take advantage of the market by producing You Only Live Twice. The film included progressive elements of Japanese culture as part of the background. Lewis Gilbert was appointed director and Ken Adam returned as production designer. Adam built a volcano hideaway set for the main antagonist, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, at Pinewood for $1 millon ($ million in dollars); at the time it was the biggest film set in Europe. Gilbert, Broccoli, Saltzman, Ken Adam and director of photography Freddie Young then went to Japan, spending three weeks searching for locations. While in Tokyo, the crew crossed paths with Peter R. Hunt, who was on holiday. Hunt had edited the first four Bond films, and he was invited to direct the second unit. The total budget for the film was $10.3 million ($ million in dollars). Initially the screenwriter was to be Harold Jack Bloom, although he was later replaced by Roald Dahl, who had little previous screenwriting experience. You Only Live Twice was the first Bond film to jettison the plot premise of the Fleming source material, although the film retains the title, the Japanese setting, the use of Blofeld as the main villain and a Bond girl named Kissy Suzuki from the novel. Filming commenced at Pinewood on 4 July 1966 before moving out to Japan on 27 July for six weeks' filming. Local Japanese interest in the filming was high, and the crew had to contend with large crowds throughout the process. Connery, however, was somewhat resigned to the project, lacking the enthusiasm he sported for Thunderball. A press conference on his arrival had been tense, \\"soured by aggressive questioning of Connery's crumpled, jet- lagged appearance\\". Primary and secondary photography finished in December; the special effects filming for the space scenes were undertaken between January and March 1967, prior to the film's release on 12 June. The cinema posters for the film stated \\"Sean Connery IS James Bond\\", to distance the Eon- produced picture from the independent Casino Royale, which had been released two months earlier. However, during the production, Connery announced that it would be his last film as Bond, leaving Broccoli to tell Alan Whicker, \\"it won't be the last Bond under any circumstances—with all due respect to Sean, who I think has been certainly the best man to play this part. We will, in our own way, try to continue the Bond series for the audience because it's too important\\". =On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969)= George Lazenby was signed on to play Bond for OHMSS. Between Sean Connery giving his notice at the beginning of filming You Only Live Twice and its release, Saltzman had planned to adapt The Man with the Golden Gun in Cambodia and use Roger Moore as the next Bond, but political instability meant the location was ruled out and Moore signed up for another series of the television programme The Saint. After You Only Live Twice was released in 1967, the producers once again picked the often-delayed On Her Majesty's Secret Service, which had previously been considered to follow both Goldfinger and then Thunderball. Peter Hunt, who had worked on the five preceding films, had impressed Broccoli and Saltzman enough to earn his directorial debut as they believed his quick cutting had set the style for the series; it was also the result of a long- standing promise from Broccoli and Saltzman for the opportunity to direct. Hunt also asked for the position during the production of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, and he brought along with him many crew members, including cinematographer Michael Reed. Hunt was focused on putting his mark, saying, \\"I wanted it to be different than any other Bond film would be. It was my film, not anyone else's\\". On Her Majesty's Secret Service was the last film on which Hunt worked in the series. Screenwriter Richard Maibaum, who worked on the first four Bond films, returned as script writer. Saltzman and Broccoli decided to drop the science fiction gadgets from the earlier films and focus more on plot as in From Russia With Love. Peter Hunt asked Simon Raven to write some of the dialogue between Contessa Teresa \\"Tracy\\" di Vicenzo and Blofeld in Piz Gloria, which was to be \\"sharper, better and more intellectual\\"; Raven's additions included rewriting the proposal scene and having Tracy quote James Elroy Flecker. Syd Cain took over from Ken Adam as production designer as Eon decided not to have Adam's larger sets to reduce the film's budget to $7 million, from the $10.3 million it took to make You Only Live Twice. Principal photography began in the Canton of Bern, Switzerland, on 21 October 1968, with the first scene shot being an aerial view of Bond climbing the stairs of Blofeld's mountain retreat. The scenes were shot atop the now-famous revolving restaurant Piz Gloria, located atop the Schilthorn near the village of Mürren. The location was found by production manager Hubert Fröhlich after three weeks of location scouting in France and Switzerland. The Swiss filming ended up running 56 days over schedule. In March 1969 production moved to England, with London's Pinewood Studios being used for interior shooting, and M's house being shot in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. In April the filmmakers went to Portugal, where principal photography wrapped in May. Filming finished on 23 June, two months later than planned, which was largely due to the warm Swiss winter, which had hampered shooting. Midway through production, acting on advice from his agent Ronan O'Rahilly, George Lazenby announced that he was not going to continue as Bond in future films, and he left the role before the December 1969 release of On Her Majesty's Secret Service. =Diamonds Are Forever (1971)= Sean Connery in Amsterdam in July 1971, filming for the seventh Bond film Diamonds are Forever. Although Eon secured the services of John Gavin to play the role of Bond, United Artists' chief David Picker was unhappy with this decision and instructed associate producer Stanley Sopel to broker a deal with Connery which saw the actor being paid $1.25 million ($ million in dollars) and 12.5% of the gross. Connery's salary took a significant part of the $7.2 million budget. The producers had originally intended to have Diamonds Are Forever re- create commercially successful aspects of Goldfinger, so they hired director Guy Hamilton as a result. Richard Maibaum also returned to write the script; the first draft envisaged the return of Auric Goldfinger portrayer Gert Fröbe, this time in the role of Goldfinger's twin brother. Maibaum also wrote a climax to the film that consisted of the new Goldfinger being chased across Lake Mead by the people of Las Vegas, all being co-ordinated by Bond. In the autumn of 1970 Tom Mankiewicz was hired to undertake re-writes, which included removing Goldfinger's brother and the Lake Mead finale. Filming began on 5 April 1971 with the desert near Las Vegas doubling for the South African scenes, followed by filming in the Great Basin Desert, Nevada in May for scenes in which Bond drives a moon buggy. On 7 June production moved to Pinewood Studios for filming at sets of the returning Ken Adam; his sets spread through four of Pinewood's stages. Filming also took place in London, Dover, Southampton, Amsterdam and the south of France; principal photography finished 13 August 1971. =Live and Let Die (1973)= While filming Diamonds Are Forever, Live and Let Die was chosen as the next Ian Fleming novel to be adapted because screenwriter Tom Mankiewicz thought it would be daring to use black villains, as the Black Panthers and other racial movements were active at that time. The new Bond actor selected by Eon was Roger Moore, and he tried not to imitate either his predecessor Sean Connery or his own performance as Simon Templar in The Saint; Mankiewicz adapted the screenplay to emphasise Moore's persona by giving him more comedy scenes and creating a light-hearted feel to Bond. Guy Hamilton was again chosen to direct, and Mankiewicz suggested they film in New Orleans, as he knew Hamilton was a jazz fan. Hamilton didn't want to use Mardi Gras, as Thunderball featured Junkanoo, a similar festival, so after more discussions with the writer and further scouting, he decided to use two well-known features of the city, the jazz funerals and the canals. While searching for locations in Jamaica, the crew discovered a crocodile farm owned by Ross Kananga, after passing a sign warning that \\"trespassers will be eaten\\". The farm was put into the script and also inspired Mankiewicz to name the film's villain after Kananga. With the rise of the popularity of Blaxploitation films in the early 1970s, it was decided to borrow elements of the genre for Live and Let Die. George Martin scored the music for Live and Let Die. Syd Cain returned as art director and was involved searching for locations with Guy Hamilton in March 1972. Principal photography began on 13 October 1972 in the Irish Bayou in Louisiana for a boat chase scene. On 29 November production moved to Jamaica, which doubled for the fictional island San Monique, the home of antagonist Kananga. In December, production was divided between interiors in Pinewood Studios, while a separate unit also shot in Harlem. John Barry, who had worked on the previous five films, was unavailable during production. Broccoli and Saltzman instead asked Paul McCartney to write the theme song. Since McCartney's salary of $15,000 (plus royalties) was high and another composer of Barry's stature could not be hired with the remainder of the music budget, George Martin, who had little experience of film scoring, was hired. =The Man with the Golden Gun (1974)= The film of The Man with the Golden Gun saw a change in location from the novel of the same name to put Bond in the Far East for the second time. After considering Beirut, where part of the film is set; Iran, where the location scouting was done but eventually discarded because of the Yom Kippur War; and the Hạ Long Bay in Vietnam, the production team chose Thailand as a primary location, following a suggestion of production designer Peter Murton after he saw pictures of the Phuket bay in a magazine. Saltzman was happy with the choice of the Far East for the setting as he had always wanted to go on location in Thailand and Hong Kong. During the reconnaissance of locations in Hong Kong, Broccoli saw the partially submerged wreckage of the former and came up with the idea of using it as the base for MI6's Far East operations. Tom Mankiewicz wrote a first draft for the script in 1973, delivering a script that was a battle of wills between Bond and the primary villain Francisco Scaramanga, whom he saw as Bond's alter ego, \\"a super- villain of the stature of Bond himself\\". Tensions between Mankiewicz and Guy Hamilton led to Richard Maibaum taking over scripting duties. Maibaum, who had worked on six Bond films previously, delivered his own draft based on Mankiewicz's work. Broccoli's stepson Michael G. Wilson researched solar power to create the MacGuffin of the \\"Solex Agitator\\". While Live and Let Die had borrowed heavily from the blaxploitation genre, The Man with the Golden Gun borrowed from the martial arts genre that was popular in the 1970s. On 6 November 1973 filming commenced at the exterior location shots of RMS Queen Elizabeth, which acted as a top-secret MI6 base grounded in Victoria Harbour in Hong Kong. The major part of principal photography started in April 1974 in Thailand. Thai locations included Bangkok, Thonburi, Phuket and the nearby Phang Nga Province, on the islands of Ko Khao Phing Kan () and Ko Tapu (). In late April production returned to Hong Kong and also shot in Macau. Production had to move to studio work in Pinewood Studios—which included sets such as Scaramanga's solar energy plant and island interior. John Barry returned to compose the score, but had only three weeks to complete the work, and the theme tune and score are generally considered by critics to be among the weakest of Barry's contributions to the series—an opinion shared by Barry himself: \\"It's the one I hate most ... it just never happened for me\\". Albert R. Broccoli (1975–1984) Following The Man with the Golden Gun, producer Harry Saltzman sold his 50% stake in Eon Productions' parent company, Danjaq, to United Artists to alleviate his financial problems, brought about by financial constraints following a downturn in the fortunes of Technicolor, in which he had invested heavily. The resulting legalities over the Bond property delayed production of the next Bond film, The Spy Who Loved Me. =The Spy Who Loved Me (1977)= Guy Hamilton was initially scheduled to follow on from The Man with the Golden Gun with The Spy Who Loved Me, but instead turned down Eon Productions during pre-production after being offered the opportunity to direct the 1978 film Superman, although he was ultimately passed up for Richard Donner. Eon then turned to Lewis Gilbert, who had directed the earlier Bond film You Only Live Twice. Broccoli commissioned a number of writers to work on the script, including Stirling Silliphant, John Landis, Ronald Hardy, Anthony Burgess and Derek Marlowe, but Richard Maibaum drew up the first draft script, with some inclusions from the previous writers. When Lewis Gilbert was hired to direct, he brought with him Christopher Wood to revise Maibaum's draft. The draft Wood prepared was challenged in court by Kevin McClory, who alleged infringement based on the use of what he claimed were his rights in SPECTRE and the Blofeld character. Eon disputed McClory's claim but had Wood remove the organisation and character from the script. Marvin Hamlisch, who was nominated for Academy and Golden Globe Awards for The Spy Who Loved Me Ken Adam returned as production designer. As no studio stages were big enough for the interior of the villain Karl Stromberg's supertanker, in March 1976 construction began of a new sound stage at Pinewood, the 007 Stage, which cost $1.8 million and became the largest stage in the world. In contrast to the volcano crater set Adam had built for You Only Live Twice in 1966—which Adam had called \\"a workable but ultimately wasteful set\\"—the 007 Stage would be a permanent structure that could be rented out to other productions. Secondary filming began in July 1976 at Baffin Island, where the ski jump for the opening credits was filmed. Principal filming commenced in Sardinia in August 1976, moving on to Egypt shortly afterwards. Further filming took place in Sardinia, Malta, Japan, Switzerland and the Faslane submarine base. On 5 December 1976, with principal photography finished, the 007 Stage was formally opened by the former Prime Minister Harold Wilson. John Barry could not work in the United Kingdom due to tax problems and suggested Marvin Hamlisch to score the film. Hamlisch composed \\"Nobody Does It Better\\" as the theme song; the score and the song were both nominated for Academy and Golden Globe Awards. =Moonraker (1979)= Eon Productions had originally planned to follow The Spy Who Loved Me with an adaptation of For Your Eyes Only, although this plan changed within weeks of the 1977 release, following the box office success of the 1977 space-themed film Star Wars. With a budget of $34 million Moonraker cost more than double any of the previous Bond films, although both Broccoli and United Artists agreed to the costs because of the profits from The Spy Who Loved Me. Lewis Gilbert was again appointed as director, and a number of the crew from The Spy Who Loved Me also joined the production. Gilbert and Tom Mankiewicz wrote the initial story, but Christopher Wood turned this into the final screenplay. Many of the script ideas came about as a result of location scouting, with Iguazu Falls being identified as a filming location while Broccoli was in Brazil for the release of The Spy Who Loved Me. Unlike previous Bond films, the production of Moonraker was not based at Pinewood, as Broccoli moved it to Paris for financial reasons, although the scenes for the cable car interiors and space battle exteriors were filmed at Pinewood, with the special effects team of Derek Meddings active in the UK throughout production. Principal photography began on 11 August 1978 in Paris. The sets designed by returning production designer Ken Adam were the largest ever constructed in France and required more than 222,000 man-hours to construct (approximately 1,000 hours by each of the crew on average). Much of the film was shot in the cities of London, Paris, Venice, Palmdale, California, Port St. Lucie, Florida and Rio de Janeiro. Principal filming finished back in Paris on 27 February 1979, a 28-week schedule that had allowed Roger Moore only three days off. John Barry was again asked to score an Eon film. =For Your Eyes Only (1981)= For Your Eyes Only marked a change in the production crew: John Glen was promoted from his duties as a film editor to director, a position he would occupy for the next four films. Since Ken Adam was busy with the film Pennies from Heaven, Peter Lamont, who had worked in the art department since Goldfinger, was promoted to production designer. Following a suggestion from Glen, Lamont created realistic sets, instead of the elaborate scenery for which the series had been known. Richard Maibaum was once again the scriptwriter for the story, assisted by Michael G. Wilson. According to Wilson, the ideas could have come from anyone as a committee that could include Broccoli, Maibaum, Wilson, Glen and stunt coordinators worked on the outlines. Much of the inspiration for the stories for the film came from two Fleming short stories from the collection For Your Eyes Only: \\"Risico\\" and \\"For Your Eyes Only\\". Another set-piece from the novel of Live and Let Die—the keelhauling—which was unused in that novel's adaptation, was inserted into the plot. Production of For Your Eyes Only began on 2 September 1980 in the North Sea, with three days shooting exterior scenes for the scenes involving the St Georges spyboat. The interiors were shot later in Pinewood Studios, as well as the ship's explosion, which was done with a miniature in Pinewood's tank on the 007 Stage. On 15 September principal photography started in Corfu at the Villa Sylva at Kanoni, above Corfu Town, which acted as the location of the Spanish villa. In October filming moved to other Greek locations, including Meteora and the Achilleion. In November the main unit moved to England, which included interior work in Pinewood, while the second unit shot underwater scenes in the Bahamas. On 1 January 1981 production moved to Cortina d'Ampezzo in Italy, where filming wrapped in February. Many of the underwater scenes, especially involving close-ups of Bond and Melina, were shot on a dry soundstage. A combination of lighting effects, slow-motion photography, wind, and bubbles added in post-production, gave the illusion of the actors being underwater. The pre-credits sequence used a church in Stoke Poges as a cemetery, while scenes involving a helicopter were filmed at the abandoned Beckton Gas Works in London. The score of For Your Eyes Only was written by Bill Conti, who retained a number of John Barry-influenced brass elements in the score but also added elements of dance and funk music. =Octopussy (1983)= In 1980 United Artists, which had provided much of the funding for the Bond films, fell into financial difficulties following the box office failure of Heaven's Gate (1980), bringing uncertainty to the future of the funding. The situation was resolved in May 1981, when Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer acquired United Artists. Following For Your Eyes Only, Roger Moore had expressed a desire to stop playing James Bond. His original contract had been for three films, a requirement fulfilled with The Spy Who Loved Me. Subsequent films had been negotiated on a film-by-film basis. The producers engaged in a semi-public quest for the next actor to play Bond, which would be for Octopussy. However, when Kevin McClory announced his re-working of Thunderball as Never Say Never Again, the producers re-contracted Moore in the belief that an established actor in the role would fare better against McClory's choice of Bond, Sean Connery. Before For Your Eyes Only had been released, Albert Broccoli had asked John Glen to return and direct Octopussy. George MacDonald Fraser wrote an initial treatment that was extensively revised by Michael G. Wilson and Richard Maibaum. First unit filming began on 10 August 1982 at the Berlin Wall crossing point Checkpoint Charlie, although the second unit had already been at work for a few weeks, filming scenes for a mid-air fight sequence. The Monsoon Palace served as the exterior of villain Kamal Khan's palace, while scenes set at the palace of titular character Octopussy were filmed at the Lake Palace and Jag Mandir. Bond's hotel was the Shiv Niwas Palace. In England RAF Northolt, RAF Upper Heyford and RAF Oakley were the main locations. Scenes set at the Karl-Marx-Stadt railways scenes were shot at the Nene Valley Railway, while studio work was undertaken at Pinewood Studios and 007 Stage. Filming finished on 21 January 1983. John Barry returned to score, having passed on For Your Eyes Only for tax reasons. While Barry wrote the title song, \\"All Time High\\", Tim Rice wrote the lyrics and the song was performed by Rita Coolidge. Octopussy had its premiere on 6 June 1983, four months before the October release of Never Say Never Again. From its budget of $27.5 million, Octopussy took $183.7 million at the box office, a figure which saw it surpass the takings of its Connery-led rival, which took $160 million. Albert R. Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson (1984–1989) In 1984 Michael G. Wilson joined Albert R. Broccoli as co-producer at Eon. Wilson had first worked on a Bond production in February 1964 with the filming of Goldfinger. He had worked on every production since The Spy Who Loved Me, and had been executive producer on Moonraker, For Your Eyes Only and Octopussy. =A View to a Kill (1985)= The day before the UK premiere of the non-Eon rival Bond film, Never Say Never Again, Eon announced that Roger Moore would return as Bond for the seventh time. John Glen also returned as director, while Peter Lamont and John Barry also signed up as they had for Octopussy. Michael G. Wilson co-wrote the screenplay with Richard Maibaum. On 27 June 1984 the 007 Stage was almost entirely destroyed by fire. It was rebuilt in time for production and reopened in January 1985, when it was renamed the \\"Albert Broccoli 007 Stage\\". The second unit started filming in Iceland in July 1984, while principal photography with Moore commenced on 1 August at Pinewood. Also in August, the second unit filmed in Paris, including scenes involving a parachute jump from the Eiffel Tower. The Amberley Museum & Heritage Centre doubled as the exterior of villain Max Zorin's mine, while the scenes in the complex under Zorin's stables were filmed in a Renault plant in Swindon, before primary filming moved to San Francisco. Filming finished in January 1985 at the 007 Stage, with the filming of the interior of Zorin's mine, designed by Peter Lamont. =The Living Daylights (1987)= With the retirement of Roger Moore following A View to a Kill, the producers searched for a new Bond and eventually cast Timothy Dalton in the lead role in August 1986. Much of the senior production crew from the previous film worked on The Living Daylights, with John Glen directing, John Barry providing the score and Peter Lamont acting as production designer. Michael G. Wilson and Richard Maibaum again provided the script and initially proposed a prequel, showing Bond's first mission, although this was turned down by Broccoli. Script work continued while the producers searched for Moore's successor. The film was shot at the 007 Stage at Pinewood Studios, with principal photography starting on 29 September 1986, before moving to Vienna on 5 October, where the crew filmed for two weeks. Meanwhile, the second unit had started work on the pre- credits sequence on Gibraltar on 17 September before moving to Morocco. Filming finished on 13 February 1987. The Living Daylights was the twelfth and final Bond film to be scored by composer John Barry. The title song of the film, \\"The Living Daylights\\", was co-written with Paul Waaktaar-Savoy of the Norwegian pop-music group A-ha and recorded by them. The group and Barry did not collaborate well, resulting in two versions of the theme song. The production costs of The Living Daylights were $40 million, and the film posted box office results of $191.2 million. =Licence to Kill (1989)= Shortly after the release of The Living Daylights, producers Albert R. Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson and writer Richard Maibaum started discussing its successor. They decided that the film would retain a realistic style, as well as showing the \\"darker edge\\" of the Bond character. For the primary location, the producers wanted a place where the series had not yet visited. While China was visited after an invitation by its government, the idea fell through partly because the 1987 film The Last Emperor had removed some of the novelty from filming in China. By this stage the writers had already talked about a chase sequence along the Great Wall, as well as a fight scene amongst the Terracotta Army. Wilson also wrote two plot outlines about a drug lord in the Golden Triangle before the plans fell through. The writers eventually decided on a setting in a tropical country while Broccoli negotiated to film in Mexico, at the Estudios Churubusco in Mexico City. In 1985 the Films Act was passed, removing the Eady Levy, which resulted in foreign artists being taxed more heavily. The associated rising costs to Eon Productions meant no part of Licence to Kill was filmed in the UK, the first Bond film not to do so. Pinewood Studios, used in every Bond film that far, housed only the post- production and sound re-recording. The initial outline of what would become Licence to Kill was drawn up by Wilson and Maibaum. Before the pair could develop the script, the Writers Guild of America (WGA) went on strike and Maibaum was unable to continue writing, leaving Wilson to work on the script on his own. The script—initially called Licence Revoked—was written with Dalton's characterisation of Bond in mind; the obsession with which Bond pursues the drug lord villain Franz Sanchez on behalf of Bond's friend, the CIA/DEA agent Felix Leiter and his dead wife is seen as being because of Bond's own \\"brutally cut-short marriage\\". John Glen returned once again to direct, teaming up once more with production designer Peter Lamont. Principal photography ran from 18 July to 18 November 1988. Shooting began in Mexico, which mostly doubled for the fictional Republic of Isthmus. Other underwater sequences were shot at the Isla Mujeres near Cancún. In August 1988 production moved to the Florida Keys, notably Key West. Seven Mile Bridge towards Pigeon Key was used for the sequence in which the armoured truck transporting Sanchez following his arrest is driven off the edge. Other locations there included the Ernest Hemingway House, Key West International Airport, Mallory Square, St. Mary's Star of the Sea Church for Leiter's wedding and Stephano's House 707 South Street for his house and patio. The US Coast Guard Pier was used to film Isthmus City harbour. John Barry was not available to score the film because of throat surgery, so the soundtrack's score was composed and conducted by Michael Kamen, who was known for scoring many action films at the time, such as Lethal Weapon and Die Hard. The film's darker and more violent plot elicited calls for cuts by the British Board of Film Classification. Licence to Kill marked the end of the involvement for a number of long-term crew members, including John Glen, Maurice Binder, Richard Maibaum and cinematographer Alec Mills. It was also the final film which was produced by the partnership of Albert Broccoli and Michael Wilson. Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli (1990–present) The relatively disappointing box office returns for Licence to Kill led to Albert Broccoli questioning his own leadership of the series, and he put Danjaq, holders of the Bond film copyright, up for sale. Timothy Dalton was quoted at the time as saying \\"My feeling is this will be the last one. I don't mean my last one, I mean the end of the whole lot. I don't speak with any real authority, but it's sort of a feeling I have\\". In 1990 the situation was further complicated when MGM/UA was sold to Qintex, which wanted to then merge with Pathé Communications; the Bond back catalogue was leased to Pathé at a lower-than-market value, without consulting Danjaq – which sued MGM/UA Communications, which was itself the target of a failed takeover bid by Pathé. In August 1990 Albert Broccoli appointed his daughter Barbara Broccoli alongside Michael G. Wilson as producers at Eon, while he concentrated on matters at Danjaq. The dispute between Danjaq and MGM/UA was protracted and delayed production of Bond 17, but was finally settled in 1993. The new producers changed the policy of behind-the-scenes continuity prevalent in the series up to that point and, from the 1990s onwards, there were more changes in key production roles, including employing directors \\"on a 'guest director' footing\\". =GoldenEye (1995)= Martin Campbell, who directed GoldenEye and Casino Royale Despite the legal action, pre-production towards the next Bond film still progressed, with some early details unveiled at the Cannes Film Festival which took place in May 1990. However, delays occurred because of the ongoing legal action with MGM/UA and, in an August 1993 interview, Dalton revealed that Michael France was involved in writing a script for the next Bond film, with Anthony Hopkins as a potential villain, adding that Hopkins had been in discussions with Eon for a number of weeks. Dalton also stated that the earliest production could begin would be in January or February 1994. Dalton's six-year contract expired in 1993, and after reading France's script for what would become GoldenEye, he announced on 12 April 1994 that he would not be returning to play Bond; he was replaced by Pierce Brosnan. After Michael France delivered the original screenplay, Jeffrey Caine was brought in to rework much of the material. Kevin Wade was also brought into the process before Bruce Feirstein gave the final polish to the script. With Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson as co- producers, Albert Broccoli oversaw the production of GoldenEye as consulting producer but is credited as \\"presenter\\". John Woo was approached to direct the film, but he turned down the opportunity, saying he was honoured by the offer. The producers then chose Martin Campbell to lead the film. Principal photography started on 16 January 1995 and continued until 6 June. The producers were unable to use Pinewood Studios, the usual location for Bond films, because it had been reserved for First Knight, so an old Rolls-Royce factory at the Leavesden Aerodrome in Hertfordshire was converted into a new studio. In February the crew moved to Monaco and Monte Carlo for scenes in a casino and a demonstration of a Tiger helicopter. The pre-credits sequence involved a bungee jump, which was filmed at the Contra Dam near Locarno, Switzerland. Reference footage for a scene consisting of a tank chase was shot on location in Saint Petersburg and matched to sets built at the Leavesden studio by production designer Peter Lamont. Scenes on a satellite dish were shot at Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, while in the UK, Epsom Downs Racecourse and the Nene Valley Railway were both used. For the scenes of the fictional Russian location of Severnaya, and other effects, Derek Meddings built a number of miniature sets at Leavesden. Meddings had worked on the Bond films since Live and Let Die and died before the film's release; GoldenEye was dedicated to his memory. The soundtrack to GoldenEye was composed and performed by Éric Serra. Prolific Bond composer John Barry turned down an offer by Barbara Broccoli to score the film. The theme song, \\"GoldenEye\\", was written by Bono and The Edge, and was performed by Tina Turner. As Serra did not collaborate with Bono or The Edge, orchestral versions of the song did not appear throughout GoldenEye, as had been the case in previous James Bond films. =Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)= Before GoldenEye had been released in November 1995, MGM/UA started their preparations for Bond 18, intending for a release in early December 1997, leaving Eon Productions little time for pre-production. The producers were unable to convince Martin Campbell to return; his agent said that \\"Martin just didn't want to do two Bond films in a row\\". Instead, Roger Spottiswoode was chosen in September 1996. With Peter Lamont unavailable because he was committed to Titanic, Spottiswoode chose Allan Cameron in his place to provide sets; Spottiswoode and Cameron had previously worked together on Air America. The story was based on a previously discarded treatment by Donald E. Westlake, which had been written before GoldenEye. The script was given a re-working by Bruce Feirstein, based on the return of Hong Kong to the Chinese. Feirstein's script was then contributed to by Nicholas Meyer before being reworked by Dan Petrie Jr. and David Campbell Wilson before Feirstein, who retained the sole writing credit, was brought in for a final polish. The script was finished a week before principal photography started, although Feirstein had to re-write sequences throughout production. The process was further hampered by poor relations between Feirstein and Spottiswoode. With the Leavesden studios unavailable, and Pinewood not having sufficient capacity, Eon converted an abandoned grocery warehouse in Hertfordshire into a filming location. With the principal crew about to fly to location in Vietnam, the Vietnamese authorities revoked permission to film at the last minute, and alternative locations were quickly found in Thailand. Second unit filming began on 18 January 1997 with Vic Armstrong directing; they filmed the pre-credits sequence at Peyresourde Airport in the French Pyrenees, before moving on to Portsmouth to film the scenes where the Royal Navy prepares to engage the Chinese. The main unit began filming on 1 April 1997 at the new studios, before filming at other UK locations; production then moved to Thailand in May. Filming completed three weeks over schedule in September 1997. Eon initially approached John Barry to score the film, but the two sides could not come to terms; the producers then approached David Arnold, whom Barry endorsed. The delays in the production process and the rush to deliver the film by the MGM/UA-imposed deadline of December 1997 drove the costs upwards to $110 million, although the film recouped $338.9 million at the box office. =The World Is Not Enough (1999)= Michael Apted, the director of The World Is Not Enough Joe Dante and then Peter Jackson were considered as directors for The World Is Not Enough. Barbara Broccoli enjoyed Jackson's Heavenly Creatures, and a screening of The Frighteners was arranged for her. She disliked the latter film, however, and showed no further interest in Jackson. Michael Apted was then selected to lead the film. Writers Neal Purvis and Robert Wade were hired after their work in Plunkett & Macleane, before Michael Apted and his wife, screenwriter Dana Stevens, undertook an uncredited rewrite. Pierce Brosnan was unhappy with some of Stevens' changes to his character, so Michael G. Wilson—who was also uncredited as screenwriter—and Bruce Feirstein undertook further revisions. Production was centred at Pinewood Studios and principal photography began there on 11 January 1999 with scenes from inside the MI6 offices, designed by Peter Lamont. The pre-title sequence was shot in Bilbao, Spain, in February, with production moving to Chamonix, France, which doubled for the Caucasus scenes. The exterior of a Kazakh nuclear facility was shot at the Bardenas Reales, in Navarre, Spain, while the exterior of an oil refinery control centre was doubled by the Motorola building in Groundwell, Swindon. The exterior of the oil pipeline was filmed in Cwm Dyli, Snowdonia, Wales, while the production teams shot the oil pipeline explosion in Hankley Common, Elstead, Surrey. The production also visited Istanbul, Turkey; the scenes of villain Elektra King's Baku villa were filmed in the city, and the famous Maiden's Tower was used for the hideout of the second villain Renard. The underwater submarine scenes were filmed in the Bahamas. David Arnold returned to score the music for The World Is Not Enough—the second Bond soundtrack he composed; Garbage sang the title song. For his work on the film, Arnold won an Ivor Novello Award. =Die Another Day (2002)= Lee Tamahori was hired to direct Die Another Day; Barbara Broccoli admired his film Once Were Warriors, calling it \\"a phenomenal piece of filmmaking\\". Broccoli noted that she and Wilson \\"sensed his genuine enthusiasm for Bond. It was simply great chemistry. Lee was the right guy and we were very, very lucky to get him\\". Screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade returned and began work in the summer of 2000 with the producers. They used a premise from Fleming's novel Moonraker as a basis, that of an industrialist villain who had two identities. With the planned release of the film being in the 40th anniversary year of the Bond film series, Tamahori named the Hong Kong hotel seen in the film the \\"Rubyeon Royale\\", for Eon's ruby anniversary, as well as Fleming's first novel, Casino Royale. Second unit filming started on Christmas Day 2001 with Laird Hamilton, Dave Kalama and Darrick Doerner performing the surfing scene at the surf break known as Jaws in Peahi, Maui; the shore shots were later taken near Cádiz, Spain and Newquay, Cornwall. Principal photography of Die Another Day began on 11 January 2002 at Pinewood studios. The film was shot primarily in the United Kingdom, Iceland, and Cádiz. Filming in the UK took place at the Eden Project, the Reform Club and Pinewood Studios' 007 Stage, with the sets by production designer Peter Lamont, which included the ice palace. During June seven separate units were filming, including underwater, aerial and miniature; principal photography finished on 9 July, in time for the premiere in London on 20 November 2002. The soundtrack was composed by David Arnold, while the title song \\"Die Another Day\\" was written and performed by Madonna, who also had a cameo appearance in the film as a fencing instructor. Die Another Day had a budget of $142 million and earned $431.9 million at the box office. =Casino Royale (2006)= Paul Haggis, who co-wrote the scripts for Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace In 1999 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer obtained the rights to the 1967 film Casino Royale from Sony Pictures Entertainment for $10 million in the out-of-court settlement of a lawsuit. The case was brought by MGM after Sony had announced a deal with Kevin McClory to produce a third version of the Thunderball novel, for which McClory held the film rights. McClory had previously acted as producer with Eon on Thunderball and had licensed his rights for the production of Never Say Never Again in 1983. In 2004, following severe financial troubles, MGM was itself acquired by a consortium backed by Sony for $5 billion. Casino Royale reboots the series, establishing a new timeline and narrative framework not meant to precede or succeed any previous Bond film. Barbara Broccoli stated that \\"For years, my father wanted to make Casino Royale—it's the Holy Grail ... We wanted to make a tougher film, the way it should have been made years ago\\". Fellow producer Michael G. Wilson agreed, commenting \\"We felt the last film was too fantastical, so we decided to go back to the basics and update\\". Neal Purvis and Robert Wade began writing a screenplay at the end of February 2004, while Pierce Brosnan was still Bond. Paul Haggis was brought in later, and his main contribution included rewriting the climax of the film. He explained that \\"the draft that was there was very faithful to the book and there was a confession, so in the original draft the character confessed and killed herself. She then sent Bond to chase after the villains; Bond chased the villains into the house. I don't know why but I thought that Vesper [Lynd] had to be in the sinking house and Bond has to want to kill her and then try and save her\\". In February 2005 Martin Campbell was announced as the film's director and the next Bond film was revealed to be Casino Royale, although the identity of the new Bond was still unknown; the producers had chosen not to renew Pierce Brosnan's contract, and in October Eon announced that the part of Bond would be taken by Daniel Craig. Principal photography for Casino Royale commenced on 3 January 2006. The film was primarily shot at Barrandov Studios in Prague, with additional location shooting in the Bahamas, Italy and the United Kingdom. The shoot concluded at Pinewood Studios on 20 July 2006. In the Bahamas filming took place at Paradise Island and Albany House, an estate owned by golfers Ernie Els and Tiger Woods. Footage set in Mbale, Uganda, was filmed at Black Park, a Country Park in Buckinghamshire, with further UK location shooting taking place at the Dunsfold Aerodrome in Surrey and the Millbrook Vehicle Proving Ground in Bedfordshire. For many of the effects in the film, Special Effects and Miniature Effects Supervisor Chris Corbould used a more realistic style of film making and significantly reduced digital effects compared with previous Bond films. Corbould noted that, \\"CGI is a great tool and can be very useful, but I will fight to the tooth and nail to do something for real. It's the best way to go\\". Corbould used the 007 stage at Pinewood for the sinking of the Venetian house at the climax of the film, which featured the largest rig ever built for a Bond film. Casino Royale featured music composed by David Arnold, his fourth soundtrack for the Bond film series. Producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli announced on 26 July 2006 that Chris Cornell would perform the title song, entitled \\"You Know My Name\\", which he co-wrote with Arnold. =Quantum of Solace (2008)= In July 2006, as Casino Royale entered post-production, Eon Productions announced that the next film would be based on an original idea by producer Michael G. Wilson. In June 2007 Marc Forster was confirmed as director. He was surprised that he was approached for the job, stating he was not a big Bond film fan through the years, and that he would not have accepted the project had he not seen Casino Royale prior to making his decision: he felt Bond had been humanised in that film, arguing that because travelling the world had become less exotic since the series' advent, it made sense to focus more on Bond as a character. Forster found Casino Royales 144-minute running time too long, and wanted his follow-up to be \\"tight and fast ... like a bullet\\". Neal Purvis and Robert Wade returned as screenwriters and completed a draft of the script by April 2007; Paul Haggis also worked on the script, completing it two hours before the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike officially began. Further work on the script had to be undertaken by Forster and Daniel Craig, who said later, \\"We had the bare bones of a script and then there was a writers' strike and there was nothing we could do. We couldn't employ a writer to finish it. I say to myself, 'Never again', but who knows? There was me trying to rewrite scenes – and a writer I am not\\". Craig also admitted that the film was not initially meant to be a sequel, but it became one because of the re-writes undertaken by him and Forster. Haggis located his draft's climax in the Swiss Alps, but Forster wanted the action sequences to allude to the four classical elements of earth, water, air and fire. Michael G. Wilson decided on the film's title Quantum of Solace only \\"a few days\\" before its announcement on 24 January 2008. Forster hired Dennis Gassner as production designer, replacing Peter Lamont. Quantum of Solace was shot in six countries, including Italy (Talamone and Siena), Chile (the Paranal Observatory), Austria (Bregenz), Mexico, Panama and the UK. In the UK interior and exterior airport scenes were filmed at Farnborough Airfield and the snowy closing scenes were filmed at the Bruneval Barracks in Aldershot, as well as ten stages at Pinewood and two theatres for ADR work. David Arnold, who composed the scores for the previous four Bond films, returned for Quantum of Solace. He said that Forster likes to work very closely with his composers and that, in comparison to the accelerated schedule he was tied to on Casino Royale, the intention was to spend a long time scoring the film to \\"really work it out\\". He also said he would be \\"taking a different approach\\" with the score. Jack White of The White Stripes and Alicia Keys collaborated on \\"Another Way to Die\\", the first Bond music duet. =Skyfall (2012)= Thomas Newman scored the 2012 film Skyfall. The production of Skyfall was suspended throughout 2010 because of MGM's financial troubles. Eon resumed pre-production following MGM's exit from bankruptcy on 21 December 2010 and in January 2011 the film was given official approval, with production scheduled to start in late 2011. The film's budget is estimated to be between $150 million and $200 million, compared to the $200 million spent on Quantum of Solace. Skyfall was directed by Sam Mendes, who first signed on to the project shortly after Quantum of Solace was released, and remained on board as a consultant during the period of uncertainty surrounding MGM's financial situation. Speculation in the media suggested that Mendes had commissioned rewrites of the script to \\"[remove] action scenes in favour of 'characterful performances'\\", with the intention of bidding for an Academy Award. Mendes denied the reports, stating that the film's planned action scenes were an important part of the overall film. The script was written by Bond screenwriting regulars Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, as well as John Logan. Roger Deakins signed on as cinematographer, while Dennis Gassner returned as production designer. Thomas Newman, who worked with Sam Mendes as composer for American Beauty, Road to Perdition, Jarhead and Revolutionary Road, replaced David Arnold as composer; British singer-songwriter Adele co- wrote and recorded the film's theme song with her regular songwriter, Paul Epworth. Principal photography was scheduled to take 133 days and began on 7 November 2011 in and around London. Production moved to Turkey in April 2012, with parts of Istanbul—including the Spice Bazaar, Yeni Camii, the Main Post Office, Sultanahmet Square and the Grand Bazaar—closed for filming in April. Filming also took place in Shanghai. Although set in Scotland, Bond's family home of Skyfall was constructed on Hankley Common in Surrey using plywood and plaster to build a full-scale model of the building, with some exterior scenes shot in Glen Etive and Glencoe. =Spectre (2015)= In September 2012 it was announced that Craig had signed to the role of Bond for the following two films, the first of which was Spectre, funded by MGM and Sony. In March 2013 Mendes announced he would not return to direct the next film in the series, although he later decided to return. In July 2013 it was revealed that John Logan would also return as writer, while in October 2014 it was announced that Léa Seydoux would play a Bond girl in the film. Filming started in December 2014 and the film was released into cinemas on 26 October 2015. =No Time to Die (2021)= No Time to Die, the twenty-fifth film in the Eon series, entered development in early 2016. Sony Pictures' contract to co-produce the series with MGM and Eon expired with the release of Spectre and the distribution rights to theatrically release the upcoming film were up for negotiation, until Eon and MGM reached the new partnership with Universal Pictures. As part of the agreement, Universal will handle the international and home video distribution for the film, while MGM retains the theatrical, digital, and television rights in the United States. The film will be theatrically distributed by United Artists Releasing, the joint venture between MGM and Annapurna Pictures, marking the first Bond film to be affiliated with the United Artists brand since 1997's Tomorrow Never Dies. In March 2017 Purvis and Wade were hired as co-screenwriters; that August, Craig was announced to be reprising his role as Bond. In March 2018 Danny Boyle signed on as director, for an original story co-written with John Hodge. That August, Boyle stepped down as director and co-writer because of creative differences; Hodge later left the project for similar reasons. By November, Paul Haggis had completed a rewrite of Purvis and Wade's draft of the script. In February 2019, it was confirmed that Scott Z. Burns was hired to rewrite an overhaul of the script.https://theplaylist.net/exclusive-scott-z-burns- bond-25-20190216/ In the search for a new director, the studio was reportedly considering Christopher McQuarrie, Jean-Marc Vallée, Edgar Wright, David Mackenzie, S. J. Clarkson, Bart Layton, and Yann Demange. But in September 2018, Cary Joji Fukunaga was announced as the film's director, the first American director of the Eon series. Production was initially scheduled to begin on 3 December 2018 with a 25 October 2019 release date. However, production finally began in late March 2019 in Nittedal, Norway with its release date set for November 2020. It was originally set to release on 8 April 2020, but it was pushed back due to the coronavirus pandemic. A report on the launch of the film on 25 April 2019 stated that Rami Malek had joined the cast as the villain. By that time, Daniel Craig had made it clear that this would be his final role as Bond. This film will begin with Bond no longer on active service and living in Jamaica, until Leiter requests his assistance in rescuing a kidnapped scientist. The final script was written Purvis and Wade with the involvement of Scott Z. Burns and Phoebe Waller-Bridge. Parts of the film were to be undertaken in Jamaica, where much of the cast was present for the official announcement for Bond 25; other planned shooting locations included Matera, Italy, Norway and London, with interiors to be shot at Pinewood Studios.

Feldman (1967) In March 1955 Ian Fleming sold the film rights of his novel Casino Royale to producer Gregory Ratoff for $6,000 ($ in dollars). In 1956 Ratoff set up a production company with Michael Garrison to produce Casino Royale; Ratoff died in December 1960. After Ratoff's death, producer Charles K. Feldman represented Ratoff's widow and obtained the rights to film. =Casino Royale (1967)= Burt Bacharach, who scored the 1967 film Casino Royale Production on Casino Royale was troubled and chaotic, with five different directors being credited for helming different segments of the film: Ken Hughes, John Huston, Joseph McGrath, Robert Parrish and Val Guest. In addition, stunt director Richard Talmadge was uncredited as co-director of the final sequence. Ben Hecht was originally commissioned by Feldman as writer, and he provided a serious interpretation of Fleming's source novel, before it was decided to turn the film into a comedy. Three main screenwriters then worked on the project—Wolf Mankowitz, John Law and Michael Sayers—and a further nine people provided uncredited additional material. Problems arose on set between Peter Sellers and director Joseph McGrath and between Sellers and Orson Welles. Sellers eventually demanded that he and Welles should not share the same set. Sellers left the film before his part was complete. A further agent's part was then written for Terence Cooper, to cover Sellers' departure, while re-writes, additional filming and post- production cutting compensated for the missing actor. Principal photography started on 11 January 1966 and was scheduled to take up to 26 weeks. Because of the delays and chaotic nature of the filming process, it finally finished ten months later in November. Feldman asked Burt Bacharach and Hal David to provide the music for the film; David worked for a few months completing his part, while Bacharach took nearly two years. The pair produced the song \\"The Look of Love\\", which was sung by Dusty Springfield. Columbia Pictures approved a production budget of $6 million for the film, although this rose to $12 million at the end of production. The film performed well, with box office returns of $41.7 million. Jack Schwartzman (1983) Never Say Never Again had its origins in the early 1960s following the controversy over the 1961 Thunderball novel, which led to Kevin McClory becoming producer of the Eon Productions film of the same name. Part of the agreement between McClory and Eon was that McClory would not make any further version of the novel for a period of ten years following the release of the 1965 Thunderball. In the mid-1970s McClory again started working on a project to bring a Thunderball adaptation to production and, with the working title Warhead (a.k.a. James Bond of the Secret Service) he brought writer Len Deighton together with Sean Connery to work on a script. The script ran into difficulties after accusations from Eon Productions that the project had gone beyond copyright restrictions, which confined McClory to a film based on the Thunderball novel only, and once again the project was deferred. Towards the end of the 1970s developments were reported on the project under the name James Bond of the Secret Service, but then producer Jack Schwartzman became involved and cleared a number of the legal issues that still surrounded the project and licensed the rights from McClory. =Never Say Never Again (1983)= With Connery still committed to the project, producer Jack Schwartzman asked him to play Bond: Connery accepted, asking for and receiving a fee of $3 million ($ million in dollars), a percentage of the profits, as well as casting, script and director approval. Schwartzman then brought on board scriptwriter Lorenzo Semple Jr. to work on the screenplay. Connery was unhappy with some aspects of the work and asked British television writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais to undertake re-writes, although they went uncredited for their efforts because of a restriction by the Writers Guild of America. The former Eon Productions editor and director of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Peter Hunt, was approached to direct the film but declined due to his previous work with Eon. Irvin Kershner, who had achieved success in 1980 with The Empire Strikes Back, was then hired. A number of the crew from the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark were also appointed, including first assistant director David Tomblin; director of photography Douglas Slocombe and production designers Philip Harrison and Stephen Grimes. Lorenzo Semple Jr., who wrote the screenplay for Never Say Never Again Filming for Never Say Never Again began on 27 September 1982 on the French Riviera for two months before moving to Nassau, the Bahamas in mid-November where filming took place at Clifton Pier, which was also one of the locations used in Thunderball. The Spanish city of Almería was also used as a location. Villain Maximillian Largo's Palmyran fortress was actually historic Fort Carré in Antibes. Principal photography finished at Elstree Studios where interior shots were filmed. Elstree also housed the \\"Tears of Allah\\" underwater cavern, which took three months to construct. Most of the filming was completed in the spring of 1983, although there was some additional shooting during the summer of 1983. Production on the film was troubled with Connery taking on many of the production duties with assistant director David Tomblin. Director Irvin Kershner was critical of producer Jack Schwartzman, saying that whilst he was a good businessman \\"he didn't have the experience of a film producer\\". After the production ran out of money, Schwartzman had to fund further production out of his own pocket and later admitted he had underestimated the amount the film would cost to make. The music for Never Say Never Again was written by Michel Legrand. Legrand also wrote the main theme \\"Never Say Never Again\\", which featured lyrics by Alan and Marilyn Bergman—who had also worked with Legrand in the Academy Award-winning song \\"The Windmills of Your Mind\\"—and was performed by Lani Hall. Fleming's estate, financially backed by Eon Productions and MGM, made a final attempt to block the film in the High Courts in London in the spring of 1983, but this was thrown out by the court and Never Say Never Again was permitted to proceed. When Never Say Never Again was released, it grossed $9.72 million ($ million in dollars) on its first weekend, which was reported to be \\"the best opening record of any James Bond film\\" up to that point and surpassing Octopussys $8.9 million ($ million in dollars) from June that year. From its budget of $36 million, Never Say Never Again grossed $160 million. McClory attempted to produce another Thunderball adaptation as Warhead 2000 AD following the success of GoldenEye in 1995. Liam Neeson and Timothy Dalton were considered for 007, while Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin were developing the film at Columbia Pictures. MGM launched a $25 million lawsuit against Sony, and McClory claimed a portion of the $3 billion profits from the Bond series. After a prolonged lawsuit, Sony backed down, and McClory eventually exhausted all legal avenues to pursue. As part of the settlement, MGM paid $10 million for the rights to Casino Royale, which had come into Sony's possession. Lisa Osborne (2012)Happy and Glorious (2012)= Daniel Craig played Bond in a short film, Happy and Glorious, produced by Lisa Osborne for the BBC and directed by Danny Boyle as part of the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. In the film Bond is summoned to Buckingham Palace by Queen Elizabeth II—played by herself—and escorts her by helicopter to the Olympic Stadium, where they both jump from the helicopter into the stadium with Union Flag parachutes. For the parachute jump, Bond and the Queen were played respectively by BASE jumpers and stuntmen Mark Sutton and Gary Connery. After the film was shown, the Queen entered the stadium via conventional means and formally opened the Games.

Przedbórz is situated on the Pilica River in the northwestern corner of the historic province of Lesser Poland. From its foundation until the Partitions of Poland, it belonged to Lesser Poland’s Sandomierz Voivodeship. The origins of the name of the town are not known. There are two explanations - it either comes from its location przed borem - in front of the wilderness, because in the Middle Ages Przedbórz was surrounded by the vast forests of the Pilica Wilderness and Holy Mountains Wilderness; or from an ancient Slavic first name Przedbor, which was popular in the early Middle Ages (a person named Przedbor might have founded a settlement here). Przedbórz (known in the past as Predbor, Predbrij, Pridborz, Przedborzs, Przedborze) is first mentioned in documents dating from 1145 as being under the jurisdiction of the Trzemeszno Monastery. King Kazimierz Wielki granted it the status of a city in 1370. He also built a castle, and frequently visited the town during his hunting trips. The Polish king Władysław Jagiełło also visited Przedbórz on several occasions. In 1512, Przedbórz had a school and a large brewery. In 1638, a fire destroyed the town and it was completely destroyed again by the Swedes in 1655 during the Deluge. During the Partitions of Poland Przedbórz was a border town for a short period of time when the Austrian - Prussian border was established along the Pilica river in 1795. In 1807 Przedbórz was annexed by the Duchy of Warsaw which became Russian-controlled Congress Poland in 1815. In the 19th century Przedbórz emerged as a local center of industry. In 1823, a cloth factory was opened by Wojciech Lange and a town hall was built in 1838–1840. During the January Uprising a battle between the insurgents and the Russians took place here (June 27, 1863). In the Second Polish Republic, Przedbórz, as part of Końskie County was a part of the Kielce Voivodeship. On the other side of the Pilica river the suburban community of Widoma had 340 residents in 1862. In World War II the area of Przedbórz was a center of resistance where units of Major Henryk Dobrzański were active. On Feb. 10, 1944, the Home Army attacked Przedbórz, destroying several facilities.

In January 1940, the Germans established a ghetto where they gathered 4,600 Jews. In 1942, the Germans liquidated the ghetto and all Jews were murdered at Treblinka extermination camp. After the war, in 1945, 9 Jews returned to Przedbórz, they were later attacked by underground anti semites. The Jews were tied and taken away in a lorry to a forest in Radoszyce, where they were shot. It is not known if there were other survivors.

He is also known as Des Parton, based on the initials of his first three names. Parton was the frontman of Strange Fox, who were nurtured by Tony Hatch in the early 1970s. Parton achieved songwriting success writing songs for Sweet Sensation in the mid-1970s, namely \\"Sad Sweet Dreamer\\" which was a number 1 single in the UK, and \\"Purely by Coincidence\\" which also charted. He arranged and co-produced both tracks with Tony Hatch and Jackie Trent. In 1975, Parton released an album entitled Snaps on the Buk record label, a short lived imprint of Decca Records. A year later he re-emerged with a band called The Cyril Dagworth Players, where Parton masqueraded as Dagworth. They released one album, also co-produced by Parton and Hatch. Parton then sang a cover version of Stevie Wonder's \\"Isn't She Lovely\\" which he again co-produced with Hatch. When the original contracted singer (Marcel King from Sweet Sensation) was unable re-create Wonder's vocal nuances, rather than dispose of the backing track, Parton sang the lead vocal, and it was decided to issue this version. It was released on 15 January 1977 and was in the UK Singles Chart for nine weeks, reaching number 4. Lack of further chart action saw him dubbed as a one-hit wonder. He later worked as a songwriter and producer based in Cheshire. He has generally sung and played guitar with local bands from North Staffordshire.

LEAM is designed to simulate future land use change as a result of alternative policies and development decisions. In recent years, LEAM has been used in combination with transportation and social cost models to better capture the effects land use has on transportation demand and social costs and vice versa.  History  LEAM was first developed in the LEAMlab of the Department of Urban and Regional Planning at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the late 1990s with funding from the National Science Foundation. Its popularity with counties and regional agencies in Illinois led to technology licensing from the university and commercialization. In 2003, LEAMgroup was founded by professors Dr. Brian Deal and Dr. Varkki Pallathucheril. Since then, LEAM and its associated planning and decision support tools have been applied all around the U.S. and abroad.  Approach  LEAM was developed to coordinate complex regional planning activities and aid in regionally-based thinking, decision support, and policy establishment. In LEAM, a region is represented as a 30x30-meter cell grid. A discrete-choice model controls whether land use in each grid cell is transformed from its present state to a new state (residential, commercial, or industrial use) in a particular time step. Several factors, or drivers, go into determining the likelihood of land use change. Drivers of change include factors associated with each cell such as proximity to cities, employment centers, roads, highways; slope; location within wetlands and floodplains; and characteristics of surrounding cells. Whether or not a cell finally changes states is determined by its probability score and the scores of its neighboring cells as well as a factor of chance. LEAM results then serve as inputs to impact assessment models that determine the implications of land use change on human, natural, and cultural systems. Some of these models include: transportation demand, air quality, water quality and quantity, runoff pollution, habitat fragmentation, and utility and infrastructure demand and cost.

History The square is named after the country's first democratically elected Prime Minister Hjalmar Branting (1860–1925). It was designed together with the surrounding building by the architect Artur von Schmalensee (1900–1972) and built in 1945–1950. It is connected to surrounding streets by several passages, of which some are the remains of alleys once criss-crossing the block – Klockgjutargränd, Kolmätargränd, and Stenbastugränd. The dramatic contrast between the narrow alleys and the relatively large round open space they hide, is astonishingly harmonic, the result of a compromise between the will of antiquaries wanting to preserve the medieval architecture and that of the department wanting to displace what it regarded as slum in disrepair. The post-WW2 classicism of the place excited a mode of indignation among other contemporary architects, claiming modern democracy had dressed itself up in a disguise.

It was built as a train station and office building in 1908; closed in 1970; listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on December 6, 1977; and renovated and reopened as a hotel in 1983.There had been other stations in Scranton, each serving one of the other companies running passenger trains in and out of the city. These served the Central Railroad of New Jersey, the Delaware and Hudson Railway and the Erie Railroad. See: \\"Index of Railroad Stations, 1480\\". Official Guide of the Railways. National Railway Publication Company. 74 (1). June 1941. The CNJ's West Lackawanna Avenue station was the last of these other stations, discontinuing its last passenger train by 1954. See: \\"Central Railroad of New Jersey, Table 1\\". Official Guide of the Railways. National Railway Publication Company. 87 (7). December 1954. The building retains its original clocks, doors, fountains, stairs, ceilings, walls, and overall appearance. Station The station at its 1908 opening In the early 1900s, Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad president William Truesdale approved a plan to replace the railroad's Scranton station, an old brick structure located on Lackawanna Avenue near Franklin Avenue. The new station, to be built about seven blocks east at 700 Lackawanna Avenue, would be a far grander structure that would also house the railroad's offices, with the exception of the executive offices in New York City. The railroad commissioned New York architect Kenneth Murchison, who executed the design in French Renaissance style. Constructed of brick and steel at a cost of around $600,000, it has concrete floors and partitions. The exterior is faced with Indiana limestone and it has an 8-foot bronze clock on the façade. The main entrance leading to the former waiting room is furnished in Formosa, a soft, pinkish-yellow Italian marble. Its Grand Lobby, two and a half stories tall, has an ornamented mosaic tile floor, a barrel-vaulted Tiffany stained-glass ceiling, rare Siena marble walls, and 36 unique Grueby Faience tile murals. The tiles are styled after the work of American artist Clark Greenwood Voorhees, and represent scenes along the DL&W;'s Phoebe Snow main line from Hoboken, N.J., to Buffalo, N.Y. A tall radio antenna was installed after a while on the roof; the railroad was a pioneer in the use of wireless communications between trains and terminals. The building, originally five stories tall, had a sixth added for office space by 1923.Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railroad Station -- National Register of Historic Places Delaware and Lehigh National Heritage Corridor Travel Itinerary The last train, the Erie Lackawanna's Lake Cities, left the station on January 6, 1970. The building was shuttered and neglected, its windows cracking, the marbled lobby used to store old timetables and railroad ledgers. The dilapidated exterior can be seen briefly in the movie That Championship Season, which was released shortly before the renovations. Passenger services Into the mid-1960s the station served several passenger Erie Lackawanna Railroad (successor to the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western) trains:Erie Lackawanna Railroad timetable, December 6, 1964, Table 1 *Phoebe Snow (Hoboken-Buffalo) *Owl (westbound) / New York Mail (eastbound) (night train, Hoboken-Buffalo) *Lake Cities (night train, Hoboken-Chicago) *Pocono Express (westbound) / Twilight (eastbound) (Hoboken-Scranton, in 1950s to Buffalo) Additionally, in earlier years, there was the Keystone Express/Pittsburgh Express (night train to Pittsburgh via Kingston, Bloomsburg and Harrisburg) and unnamed trains to Utica and to Oswego via Syracuse.Lackawanna Railroad timetable, January 3, 1949 Hotel The Grand Lobby in 2009. In the early 1980s, as Scranton struggled with 13 percent unemployment and a slumping economy, city leaders conceived of a redeveloped station as tourist attraction and rallying point. \\"Basically, we're looking for people to come to Scranton who would not come to Scranton normally,\\" Mayor James McNulty told the Associated Press in 1982. \\"We want to give the hotel a dimension as a destination instead of a way station, so this can be some place to go.\\" The building was later purchased by MetroAction, a Scranton Chamber of Commerce corporation that focused on downtown development. Its redevelopment, the \\"linchpin of Scranton's downtown revitalization program\\", was ultimately spearheaded by The Erie-Lackawanna Restoration Associates, a group of private investors, and funded to the tune of $13 million through a combination of federal, state, and municipal money, plus donations from banks and other local businesses. The building was renovated as a hotel, furnished by Bethlehem Furniture Manufacturing Corp., and renamed The Hilton at Lackawanna Station. The renovation work was designed by Balog, Steines, Hendricks, and Manchester Architects, Inc., and won a 1984 Design Honor Award from the Ohio chapter of the American Institute of Architects. The building reopened on New Year's Eve in 1983, ushered back to life by some 650 partygoers dancing to the Guy Lombardo Orchestra under the direction of Art Mooney.Roddy, Michael. Scranton is Converting Railroad Station Into Hotel Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. January 7, 1983. Pg 3. Accessed July 16, 2010 The station renovation was just half of the railroad-related repurposing meant to enliven downtown Scranton; the other half was Steamtown USA, a museum being built on the old Lackawanna railyard. On February 3, 1984, McNulty stood before the station to welcome the first of Steamtown's exhibits to the city: a 350-ton Canadian Pacific steam locomotive chugging up with a baggage car and five passenger cars. \\"Welcome to the first day of Scranton's new future,\\" McNulty told a crowd, which cheered. In 1993, the hotel was purchased for $4 million by DanMar Hotel Inc., which shifted its hotel-chain affiliation two years later from Hilton to Radisson. DanMar began trying to sell the building in December 2004 to the University of Scranton, many of whose visitors stayed at the hotel, but university officials formally declined the offer in May 2005. DanMar ultimately sold the building for $7 million to Akshar Lackawanna Station Hospitality LP, a unit of El Centro, Calif.-based Calvin Investments LLC, which owned about a dozen hotels at the time. The contract was signed up in July 2005 and the sale was completed in October. The new owners pledged to spend $1.5 million to $1.7 million on renovations to wrap up in summer 2006, but the work actually took place in 2007-09. The hotel is the setting, though not the actual filming location, for \\"Dwight's Speech\\" in the American television show The Office. Many of the show's cast members stayed at the hotel during the October 2007 fan convention and again during the show's public wrap party in May 2013. Passenger train service to Scranton would be restored by the Lackawanna Cut-Off Restoration Project. The plan would extend New Jersey Transit (NJ Transit) service from New York City and Hoboken, New Jersey, via the Lackawanna Cut-Off.

He was married to Mary Philipse, middle daughter of Frederick Philipse, second Lord of the Philipsburg Manor, and a possible love interest of George Washington. She owned a one-third share of the Philipse Patent, a vast landed estate on the Hudson River which later became Putnam County, New York. Following their marriage Morris had a large country estate named Mount Morris (today the Morris-Jumel Mansion) built in northern Manhattan between the Hudson and Harlem rivers in what is now Washington Heights.

Mount Morris, today's Morris-Jumel Mansion Map of the Philipse Patent showing the holdings of Philip, Susanna, and Mary Philipse Morris was born in England on 28 January 1727, the third son of Roger Morris of Netherby, in the North Riding of Yorkshire, and Mary Jackson, the fourth daughter of Sir Peter Jackson. On 13 September 1745, he obtained a commission in the 48th Regiment of Foot. The regiment served at Falkirk and Culloden, and in Flanders. Morris came to America with General Edward Braddock and served as his aide-de-camp. He was wounded during Braddock's Defeat in 1755 near Fort Duquesne in western Pennsylvania. Transferred to the 35th Regiment of Foot in 1758, Morris served in Fort Frederick in Nova Scotia; he led the Cape Sable Campaign against the Acadians. Morris joined the Louisbourg Grenadiers, a special corps made up of the Grenadiers of the 22nd, 40th and 45th Regiments, during General James Wolfe's invasion of French Quebec where he participated in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham on 13 September 1759. During the siege of Louisbourg, Grenadiers suffered a loss of fifty-five killed and wounded. In May 1760, Morris was promoted to lieutenant-colonel of the 47th Regiment of Foot shortly after the Battle of Sainte-Foy, and participated in General Jeffery Amherst's assault and capture of Montreal on 8 September 1760 ending French rule in North America. Morris retired from the British army in 1764 and settled in New York City on the southeast corner of Whitehall and Stone streets with his American wife, Mary Philipse, nicknamed Charming Polly, whom he had married in 1758. Middle daughter of Frederick Philipse, second Lord of the Philipsburg Manor, she had been a possible love interest of George Washington,See The Washington legend for excerpts of letters from Joseph Chew to Washington during 1756-1757 concerning \\"Polly\\" Philipse. and owned a one-third share of the Philipse Patent, a vast landed estate on the Hudson River which later became Putnam County, New York. Before wedding, a prenuptial agreement was composed that shared a life lease of the estate between husband and wife, transferred after their death to children. The Morrises became pillars of the local establishment since Roger Morris was appointed on the Governor’s Council of the Province of New York. The following year after his marriage, Morris had a large country estate named Mount Morris (today the Morris-Jumel Mansion) built in northern Manhattan between the Hudson and Harlem rivers in what is now the Washington Heights neighborhood. Situated on Coogan's Bluff, its vista included lower Manhattan, the Hudson and its Palisades, the Bronx, Westchester, the Long Island Sound and the Harlem River.Morris-Jumel Mansion on the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation website American Revolution Morris and his family lived in Mount Morris from 1765 until 1775, when the American Revolution began.

These were later sold by auction along with Morris's plate and furniture without compensation despite assurance of restitution in the 1783 Treaty of Paris that Revolutionary representatives had signed with the British.Description of the Abstract of Sales, Commissioners of Forfeiture: \\"Article V of the peace treaty signed by Britain and the United States in Paris on September 3, 1783, insisted on the restitution of all estates, rights, and properties, which have been confiscated belonging to real British subjects and to noncombatant loyalists. Tories who fought the United States were to be given one year to reclaim their property and leave the country. Payments were to be made to loyalists whose estates had already been sold. Article VI prohibited any future confiscations.\\" See: Proceedings of the Commissioners of Forfeiture Summary As many citizens of New York, however, still harbored strong resentment against the loyalists, the Provincial Congress effectively nullified that article of the Treaty of Paris of 1783 by an act of May 12, 1784.Yoshpe, Harry B.

In 1809 he bought the interest of the heirs of Morris for this property for £20,000 sterling and brought suit against the State. After Mary Philipse Morris died in 1825 Astor attempted to collect rents on the lands, but intermediate owners who had previously purchased lands from the NY Commission of Forfeiture refused to pay and Astor tried to evict them. A compromise was reached in 1828 when NY State agreed to compensate Astor for the reversionary rights, which, with costs, amounted to $561,500 when paid in 1832.In 1809, John Jacob Astor bought the interest of the heirs of Morris for this property for £20,000 and brought suit against the State. The State to protect those who held title from the Commissioners of Forfeiture, passed a law, April 16, 1827, directing 5 suits to be prosecuted to judgment in the Circuit Court of New York for review and final decision. If against the defendants, the State agreed to pay $450,000 in 5 per cent stock, redeemable at pleasure; and if the decision included improvements that had been made by occupants, $250,000 more. Three suits were tried, each resulting in favor of Astor; upon which the comptroller was, by act of April 5, 1832, directed to issue stock for the full amount, with costs. The amount issued was $561,500. Few suits have been tried in the State involving larger interests to greater numbers, or which were argued with more ability, than this.

Angelo is a character in Shakespeare's play Measure for Measure. He is the play's main antagonist. Role in the play Angelo is the deputy to the Duke of Vienna, Vincentio. Vincentio begins the play by departing the city under mysterious circumstances and leaving the strait-laced Angelo in power. Angelo's first act is to begin the enforcement of an old law that makes fornication punishable by death. He proves himself a hypocrite when Isabella, the sister of Claudio (the first man sentenced under the law), comes to plead for her brother's life. Angelo agrees to rescind the sentence only if she will sleep with him. Angelo is ultimately duped by being set up with Mariana, a woman he was once betrothed to, who masquerades as Isabella at the assignation. After Angelo thinks he has attained the object of his desire, he covers his tracks by ordering the execution of Claudio after all. Before the scheme is revealed to him, he admits his angst over his behaviour: \\"This deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant And dull to all proceedings. A deflower'd maid! And by an eminent body that enforced The law against it! But that her tender shame Will not proclaim against her maiden loss, How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no; For my authority bears of a credent bulk, That no particular scandal once can touch But it confounds the breather. He should have lived, Save that riotous youth, with dangerous sense, Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge, By so receiving a dishonour'd life With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived! A lack, when once our grace we have forgot, Nothing goes right: we would, and we would not.\\"Act 4, Scene 4  Character analysis  Angelo is often highlighted as a controversial character who makes readers consider the relationship between justice and mercy. There is much debate about what Shakespeare intended this character to portray. Critics disagree about whether Angelo is a good man who has fallen because of power and sexual temptation or a malicious man from the start. Regardless, he is the personification of justice in the play. When juxtaposed against Isabella (mercy), Angelo represents adherence to the law and punishment for sin, though he does not always adhere to the strict justice he enforces. Once Angelo meets Isabella he is forced to consider himself in a different light and acknowledge his shortcomings. Measure for Measure is considered one of Shakespeare's problem plays because it deviates from the traditional comedy. Angelo's character is a major reason for this classification because Shakespeare created him with tragic qualities, but framed his character within a comedy. Performances Measure for Measure was rarely performed until Samuel Phelps played Duke Vincentio at the Sadler's Wells Theatre in the 1840s. The play proved to be more popular with audiences in the twentieth century, with Angelo being the most attractive role for actors. The most famous performance of the role was by John Gielgud in Peter Brook's legendary 1950 production at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre. Other actors who have distinguished themselves in the role of Angelo include Charles Laughton, Ian Richardson, Brian Bedford, and John Cazale.

The plot Ruth is a young orphan girl working in a respectable sweatshop for the overworked Mrs Mason. She is selected to go to a ball to repair torn dresses. At the ball she meets the aristocratic Henry Bellingham, a rake figure who is instantly attracted to her. They meet again by chance and form a secret friendship; on an outing together they are spotted by Mrs Mason who, fearing for her shop's reputation, dismisses Ruth. Alone in the world, Ruth is whisked away by Bellingham to London where it is implied she becomes a fallen woman. They go on holiday to Wales together and there on a country walk Ruth meets the disabled and kind Mr Benson. Bellingham falls sick with fever and the hotel calls for his mother who arrives and is disgusted by her son's having lived in sin with Ruth. Bellingham is persuaded by his mother to abandon Ruth in Wales, leaving her some money. A distraught Ruth attempts suicide but is spotted by Mr Benson who helps comfort her. When he learns of her past and that she is alone he brings her back to his home town, where he is a Dissenting minister, to stay with him and his formidable but kind sister Faith. When they learn that Ruth is pregnant they decide to lie to the town and claim that she is a widow called Mrs Denbigh, to protect her from a society which would otherwise shun her. Ruth has her baby, whom she names Leonard. She is transformed into a Madonna type figure, calm and innocent once more. The rich local businessman Mr Bradshaw admires Ruth and employs her as a governess for his children, including his eldest daughter Jemima who is in awe of the beautiful Ruth. Ruth goes away with the Bradshaws to a seaside house while one of Mr Bradshaw's children is convalescing from a long illness. Mr Bradshaw brings Mr Donne, a man whom he is sponsoring to become their local MP, to the seaside to impress him. Ruth recognises Mr Donne as actually being Mr Bellingham and the two have a confrontation on the beach. Bellingham offers to marry Ruth as he claims he still loves her and for the sake of their child, Ruth rejects him saying she will not let Leonard come in contact with a man like him. From local gossip Jemima discovers about Ruth's past, though she is still unaware that it was Mr Donne who is Leonard's father. Jemima is headstrong and already jealous that her suitor Mr Farquhar, her father's business partner, seems to admire Ruth over her. The truth is Mr Farquhar is put off by Jemima's erratic behaviour, caused by her father's good intentioned interference. Jemima however decides to keep quiet over Ruth's past as she realises that she comes from a more privileged background and the same could well have happened to her, had she been in Ruth's situation. Mr Bradshaw discovers also from local gossip however that Ruth is a fallen woman and despite Jemima's passionate defence of Ruth she is thrown out of the house and sacked. Ruth goes home and has to reveal to Leonard that he is in fact illegitimate; he is devastated and ashamed by the news. Mr Bradshaw also goes to his old friend Mr Benson and argues with him as he allowed the lie to be told and for Ruth to enter not only his but also Mr Bradshaw's house. Jemima and Mr Farquhar marry and have their own child and form a good friendship with Ruth and Leonard but they are still on the outskirts of society. Ruth goes among the poor to work as a nurse to the sick and gains a good reputation there, making Leonard proud of his mother once more and restoring their relationship. Mr Bradshaw's son is found to have been embezzling the company's funds and his father disowns him. However, when his son is later involved in an accident, Mr Bradshaw is distraught and realises that his morals had been perhaps too heavy-handed in the past. His son recovers and Mr Bradshaw starts to rethink his life. Ruth has to give up her work as there is a catching fever in the environment. A local doctor offers to sponsor Leonard's studies at a good school and the Farquhars offer to go away on holiday with Ruth and Leonard. However before Ruth has made a decision she hears that Mr Donne is very sick; she confides in the doctor the truth about who Mr Donne really is, and goes to him. He is delirious with fever and does not recognise her but she nurses him back to health. Ruth however falls sick and dies from the illness. At the funeral many of the poor that Ruth had looked after praise her, and the chapel is full of people that loved Ruth, despite her being a fallen woman. Mr Donne comes to Mr Benson's house and sees Ruth dead, he is momentarily sad and offers money to Mr Benson who realises who he must be and throws him out of the house. The novel ends with Mr Bradshaw finding a weeping Leonard at his mother's grave, whom he leads home to Mr Benson, and reforming his friendship with Mr Benson realising that as a member of the society that ostracised Ruth, he is also responsible for her death. Theme The book is a social novel, dealing with Victorian views about sin and illegitimacy. It is a surprisingly compassionate portrayal of a 'fallen woman', a type of person normally outcast from respectable society. It examines the social stigma of illegitimacy. Ruth goes on to gain a respectable position in society as a governess, and the novel looks at whether the sinful can be reintegrated into society. Characters * Ruth Hilton – The titular heroine.

Literary Significance and reception Ruth received a mixed critical reception. As a work that dealt frankly with seduction and illegitimacy, it inevitably attracted controversy: Gaskell reported that it was a \\"prohibited book\\" in her own household, that friends expressed \\"deep regret\\" at its publication, and that two acquaintances burnt their copies.Elizabeth Gaskell, The Letters of Mrs. Gaskell, ed. J. A. V. Chapple and Arthur Pollard (1966), 203–226, passim. On the other hand, some reviewers complained that Gaskell painted Ruth as too passive a victim of Bellingham's advances, eluding the question of Ruth's own sexual feelings. Gaskell loaded the story down with so many extenuating circumstances that Ruth scarcely seemed a representative example of a \\"fallen woman.\\"Alan Shelston, \\"Introduction,\\" in Elizabeth Gaskell, Ruth (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1985), xii–xiv. Ruth is one of several 19th-century British and American novels that cast a \\"fallen woman\\" with an illegitimate child in the role of heroine. It may be compared to Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel The Scarlet Letter (1850), published just a few years earlier, and in many respects it anticipates Thomas Hardy's novel Tess of the d'Urbervilles (1891). Ruth, like Tess, is a working-class girl who is distinguished from her peers by both unusual sensitivity and sexual ignorance. But Gaskell's treatment of her heroine differs somewhat from Hardy's in that she emphasises Ruth's guilt, regret, and struggle to expiate her sin, while Hardy is less inclined to view Tess as a sinner.Alan Shelston, \\"Introduction,\\" in Elizabeth Gaskell, Ruth (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1985), xiv–xvi.

That evening, a bomb went off at the Gold Mohur hotel, where U.S. troops had been staying while en route to Somalia, though the troops had already left when the bomb exploded. The bombers targeted a second hotel, the Aden Movenpick, where they believed American troops might also be staying. That bomb detonated prematurely in the hotel car park, around the same time as the other bomb explosion, killing an Austrian tourist and a Yemeni citizen. Osama bin Laden claimed responsibility for the attack. *On February 26, 1993, the World Trade Center was bombed for the first time. A bomb built in Jersey City was driven into an underground garage of the World Trade Center. The blast killed six people and injured 1,500 others. The attack was not an official al-Qaeda operation, though the attack's mastermind, Ramzi Yousef, had trained in al-Qaeda camps. Osama bin Laden was never charged for the attack.https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/bin- laden-killed *On November 13, 1995, a car bomb exploded at a facility in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia where the U.S. military was training Saudi National Guardsmen. Five Americans and two Indians were killed and 60 people were wounded.Chronology of attacks on Westeners in Saudi Arabia The attack has been credited to al-Qaeda by the government of Saudi Arabia although Osama bin Laden never took credit for the bombing. *In August 1998, Al-Qaeda operatives carried out the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killing 224 people and injuring more than 5,000 others. 2000s after it was bombed 2000 *Al-Qaeda planned to attack on January 3, 2000, but the effort failed due to too much weight being put on the small boat meant to bomb the ship. *Despite the setback with USS The Sullivans, al-Qaeda succeeded in bombing a U.S. Navy warship in October 2000 with the USS Cole bombing, killing 17 sailors. 2001 * On September 9, 2001, two Tunisian members of al-Qaeda assassinated Ahmed Shah Massoud, the leader of the Northern Alliance.

Four commercial jet airliners were hijacked. Two of these were crashed into the Twin Towers which later collapsed, destroying the rest of the World Trade Center building complex. The third was crashed into the Pentagon and the fourth in a field during a struggle between passengers and hijackers to control the airplane. Nearly 3,000 people were killed in the attacks, making them the deadliest act of terrorism to occur in history, and more than 6,000 others were injured. An investigation conducted after the attacks concluded that members of al-Qaeda planned and orchestrated the attacks. Osama bin Laden initially denied his organization's involvement, but later in 2004 admitted his organization was responsible. The U.S., amongst other 40 countries, later invaded Afghanistan to dismantle the al-Qaeda, sparking the War in Afghanistan and dismantling the Taliban instead. * On December 22, 2001, al-Qaeda operative Richard Reid attempted to detonate explosives packed into the shoes he was wearing, while on American Airlines Flight 63 from Paris to Miami.

Despite being temperamental and sometimes physically violent, he is popular at school.

Because he keeps quiet about his thoughts, Yūya often has trouble figuring out his motives. He has been friends with Chiba since middle school. He quickly realized Yūya has a crush on Azusa but it was unclear whether he was trying to hinder a relationship between them or encourage it. Nagisa develops feelings for Yūya and clearly demonstrates his jealousy towards the fact that Yuya still has lingering feelings for Azusa, even after he got back together with Ako. He gets together with Yūya in the end. :He was transferred to Raspberry Dorm due to a violent incident involving a teacher.

After an incident regarding Nagisa, Azusa broke up with her because he believed that Ako loved Nagisa more than she loved him. Ako gradually began to pretend to herself that she loved Nagisa, though deep in her heart she still knew that the one she loved was Azusa.

As of 2019 it has 2,570 inhabitants. On July 29, 1921 a temperature of was recorded in the city. Since then, it is the highest temperature ever recorded in any city located in present-day Poland (the town was then a part of Germany). History Pruszków Castle Prószków in the Silesian Duchy of Opole of fragmented Poland was first mentioned in a 1250 deed. From the 14th century onwards the estates were held by the Prószkowski (also known as Pruskowski, Pruskovsky, von Proskau) noble family. In fact, the noble family's surname is after the name of the town. Count Jerzy (Jiri, George) Prószkowski had the parish church and a Renaissance castle built in the late 16th century, which both were set ablaze by Swedish troops during the Thirty Years' War and had to be rebuilt in their present Baroque style after the war. Baroque Saint George Church After the First Silesian War the town became part of Prussia in 1742 under the Germanized name Proskau. From 1763 the castle housed a famous faience manufacture, founded by count Leopold Prószkowski.F.

Part of the collection was found in 2011 in Brno and Mikulov in the Czech Republic. From 1871 to 1945 the town was part of Germany. From 1847 the castle was used as an agronomic college, which was relocated to Berlin in 1881. The succeeding institute for pomological research, including an arboretum and extensive orchards, exists up to today. After World War II only parts of the German population were expelled. Prószków regained a town charter in 2004, it officially adopted its German name Proskau as a second name on 30 April 2010. The coat of arms of the town is after that of the Prószkowski family.

He played all or part of three seasons in Major League Baseball from 1944 to 1946. Zak played for the Pittsburgh Pirates his entire MLB career, his main position being shortstop. For his career, Zak hit for a .269 batting average.  Minor Leagues  Zak was a gifted athlete, but had little interest in playing baseball for a living. In the spring of 1941, he visited a high-school friend, Ed Sudol, who had been signed by the Tarboro Orioles of the Coastal Plain League. Sudol never made it to the majors as a player, but did as an umpire. The Orioles were in need of a shortstop and gave Zak a tryout. He had not played the position before, but showed enough to earn a contract for the summer. Zak earned an invitation to the Pirates camp in 1944, and made the club. In an interesting coincidence, his manager was named Frankie (Frisch) as was the player with whom he competed for the starting shortstop job (Gustine).  All-Star selection  Zak never had a lot of playing time, his highest number of at bats was 160. Even so, he still managed to become an All-Star in 1944. When Eddie Miller of the Cincinnati Reds was injured, Zak was named as his replacement,These Guys Weren't Stars possibly because the game was being held at Forbes Field, home of the Pirates, and selecting Zak allowed MLB not to have to purchase an extra train ticket.  Death  Zak died suddenly from a heart attack on February 6, 1972, just 16 days before his 50th birthday.

Jennings (1791 – February 12, 1856) was an African-American tradesman and abolitionist in New York City, New York. He operated and owned a tailoring business. In 1821 he was one of the first African Americans to be granted a patent for his method of dry cleaning. With the proceeds of his invention he bought his wife and children’s freedom, then continued his civil rights work. Jennings became active in working for civil rights for the African-American community. In 1831, he was selected as assistant secretary to the First Annual Convention of the People of Color in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which met in June of that year. He helped arrange legal defense for his daughter, Elizabeth Jennings, in 1854 when she challenged a private streetcar company's segregation of seating and was arrested. She was defended by the young Chester Arthur, and won her case the next year. With two other prominent African-American leaders, Jennings organized the Legal Rights Association in 1855 in New York, which raised challenges to discrimination and organized legal defense for court cases. He founded and was a trustee of the Abyssinian Baptist Church, a leader in the African-American community.Alexander, Leslie M. African or American?

He built a business and married a woman named Elizabeth, who was born in 1798 in Delaware into slavery and died March 5, 1873.Death Record NYC #cn 142327 Under New York's gradual abolition law of 1799, she was converted to the status of an indentured servant and was not eligible for full emancipation until 1827. It freed slave children born after July 4, 1799, but only after they had served “apprenticeships” of twenty-eight years for men and twenty-five for women (far longer than traditional apprenticeships, designed to teach a young person a craft), thus compensating owners for the future loss of their property.\\"African American Voting Rights\\" , Longreads, accessed 17 July 2019 He and his wife had three children: Matilda Jennings (b. 1824, d. 1886), Elizabeth Jennings (b. March 1827 d. June 5, 1901), and James E. Jennings (b. 1832). Matilda Jennings was a dressmaker and wife of James A. Thompson, a Mason. Elizabeth Jennings was the wife of Charles Graham, whom she married on June 18, 1860. James E. Jennings was a public school teacher. Career Jennings built a business as a tailor, and was well-respected in the community. He spent his early earnings on legal fees to purchase his wife and some of their children out of slavery. Their daughter Elizabeth Jennings was born free on July 11, 1827 and became a schoolteacher and church organist. Jennings also supported the abolitionist movement and became active in working for civil rights of free African-Americans. He was active on issues related to emigration to other countries; opposing colonization in Africa, as proposed by the American Colonization Society; and supporting expansion of suffrage for African-American men. Civil rights activism Jennings was a leader in the cause of abolitionism and African-American civil rights. After his daughter, Elizabeth Jennings, was forcibly removed from a \\"whites only\\" streetcar in New York City, he organized a movement against racial segregation in public transit in the city; the services were provided by private companies. Elizabeth Jennings won her case in 1855. Along with James McCune Smith and Rev. James W.C. Pennington, her father created the Legal Rights Association in 1855, a pioneering minority-rights organization. Its members organized additional challenges to discrimination and segregation, and gained legal representation to take cases to court.

The Coat of arms had been in used before 1856, but in that year the Sovereign State of Bolívar was created, and its symbols changed, The new coat of arms, would be the same as the Coat of arms of Colombia but with a red oval around it, that read “ESTADO SOBERANO DE BOLIVAR”. In 1886 the states were suppressed and Departments created instead, the symbols were used once again but the originals were corrupted and so there are some variations on the current coat of arms, and that which was specified on the blazon. Design and meanings The shield is a traditional in Spanish Heraldry, is of a squared form with a small appendage in the lower middle part. It is also tierced in a party per fess, in chief per pale manner, and fimbriated in argent. It is crowned by a goshawk with a garland of olive, that rests upon the shield, with a scroll behind it, and is mantled in Or on the sides. Divisions 200px The first division, occupying the upper left corner, is a field of or charged by coconut palm. The coconut palm is a distinct feature of the Caribbean. The field represents gold and the richness of the land, the palm tree symbolizes stability and love in heroic enterprises. The second division, occupying the right upper corner, is a field of gules with five Solidus coins in argent placed in saltire. The gules, or red, represents valor, honor, fire, and victory, and also loyalty to the crown. The coins are supposed to be in argent or silver, representing purity, faith and obedience, but instead they are now displayed in Or, or gold, probably to suppress its meaning of obedience, trying to be more independent, and less royalist. The third division occupies the lower part of the shield. It is a field of azure with an undulated sea, charged by a Barque in sable. The blue, or azure, is an allusion to water, and the Caribbean Sea which forms an integral element of the department, it also alludes to its hydrological diversity, as the department is bathed by many important rivers and contains many marches and lakes. The black naval ship, it's a symbol of its maritime status, Cartagena, its capital, was and is a very important sea port, and the black represents its role in slavery as a slave port also, however, the ship is not black anymore but it has been changed to white and brown. Crest and motto Coat of arms of Colombia. Crest with no helm or mantling present, a bird with an olive crown, with a scroll in between, much like the Coat of arms of Bolívar. Although very unusual in heraldry, having a crest with no helm or mantling, it is common in the Andean Countries, as almost all of them display a condor with a scroll. The coat of arms of Bolívar follows this tradition and it has a goshawk with its wings extended looking to the left, symbolizing power, greatness and strength, holding an olive crown, symbolizing peace. In the blazon of the coat of arms, it calls for an “Aguila azorada” meaning an eagle in pursuit, but also it hints the species, as “azor” means goshawk in Spanish. A scroll appears behind the bird, with the motto that reads in Latin, “Ab Ordine Libertas”, the old motto of Colombia, that is now translated into Spanish as “Orden y Libertad”, but which in a broader sense means, “From Order, Comes Freedom”.

It was one of the comedian’s few sound films. The Cat’s Paw, a novel by Clarence Budington Kelland, had appeared in the Saturday Evening Post from August 26-September 30, 1933, when Lloyd read it, and decided to buy the rights to it for $25,000. Plot Ezekiel Cobb, a naive young man raised by missionaries in China, is sent to the United States to seek a wife. He is promptly enlisted by the corrupt political machine of the fictional city of Stockport, led by the corrupt boss Jake Mayo (George Barbier) to run for mayor as phony \\"reform\\" politician. He is expected to be the \\"cat's paw\\" of the political machine. Cobb unexpectedly takes his job seriously. Frequently quoting Chinese poet “Ling Po” (an apparent mispronunciation of Li Po), he embarks on a campaign to clean his town of its corrupt political machine. Fighting back, the corrupt politicians frame Cobb. He turns the table on them, however, by enlisting the help of his friends in the local Chinese community, who help him kidnap the corrupt politicians and their hoodlum backers, detaining them in the \\"cellar of Tien Wang.\\" He tells them that since his attempts to use western methods have not worked, he is going to use the methods of the ancient Chinese: either they confess or they will be executed. They take a man into a back room – everyone says it’s a bluff, but then the man screams in terror and a moment later his decapitated body is brought out with his head set on top of his chest. When the second man is taken to the back room, it is shown that Cobb has enlisted the help of The Great Chang a famous Chinese magician on his first American tour, and that they are using his tricks to fake the executions. This tactic works, and Mayo decides to throw his support to Cobb after all. The town is swept of its corruption and Cobb, with the support of local girl Petunia Pratt (Una Merkel), abandons plans to return to China and stays in the U.S. to fight corruption in his town. But his new wife insists on him returning to China. Production notes thumb In an early scene, Cobb, as a young boy newly arrived in China, is given a book written by Ling Po. In the closeup of the cover, the words 靈普哲學心理論述 (A Treatise on Philosophy and Psychology by Ling Pu) are seen. However, a subsequent closeup of an open page of the book shows an excerpt from the Analects of Confucius.

The orchestra performs in Meymandi Concert Hall and performs occasionally with the Carolina Ballet and the Opera Company of North Carolina. In 2017–18, the organization celebrated its 85th anniversary season. Concert series are also performed across North Carolina in the cities of, Chapel Hill, Cary, Southern Pines, New Bern, Wilmington, and Fayetteville, among others. History In 1932, Lamar Stringfield united a group of volunteers to form the North Carolina Symphony. They first performed in Hill Hall at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill in North Carolina on May 14, 1932. The original musicians of the symphony were unpaid local musicians. By 1935, the North Carolina Symphony had performed in more than fifty cities and towns in North Carolina, in over 140 concerts. Dr. Benjamin Swalin, Music Director from 1939 to 1972, continued the orchestra's mission to reach as many North Carolina natives as possible. In the 1940s, the North Carolina Symphony became the first orchestra to receive continuous state funding. The \\"Horn Tootin’ Bill\\", which asserted that state funds would be given to orchestras, was passed by the North Carolina State Legislature in March 1943. The North Carolina Symphony continues to receive this state funding today. In 1942, the Symphony began to focus on education, bringing in young children and students into the concert hall to ask questions and hear the musicians play. The Symphony began coordinating with elementary schools, exposing many children to symphonic music at an early age. The North Carolina Symphony is an orchestra with a reputation for playing many genres and types of music outside of classical concerts. In 2007, the Symphony toured western North Carolina, with a program featuring traditional North Carolina folk music; Cherokee flutist, fiddlers, banjo players, and clogging performed with the Symphony. Since July 2004, Grant Llewellyn has been the orchestra's music director. His initial contract was for 4 years, and in November 2006, his contract was extended to 2012. In 2013, Llewellyn's contract was extended through 2018. Activities The orchestra has released several albums, such as Britten's Cello Symphony and Sonata with cellist Zuill Bailey, which debuted at #1 on the Billboard Traditional Classical chart. David Hartman, the host of the ABC television program Good Morning America, is the host for the North Carolina Symphony radio broadcasts. As part of the orchestra's education program, around 50 of the orchestra's 200 annual performances during the year are devoted to students. To engage young people's interest in orchestral instruments, they include an \\"Instrument Zoo,\\" where children have a hands-on opportunity to try various instruments. https://www.ncsymphony.org/education/elementary-school-programs/In addition, the orchestra holds a Youth Concerto Competition, sponsors the Triangle Youth Philharmonic, and invites students to observe rehearsals.

He was appointed the first Camp Chief of Gilwell Park in May 1919, and organized the first Wood Badge adult leader training course there in September 1919. He served in the Scouting organization until 1923, and was honoured by having the Gidney Cabin at Gilwell, a training centre, named for him. Biography Gidney started one of the first Scout Troops in 1908, when he was only 17 years old. Gidney then served in World War I. He was seriously wounded and invalided out of the army before the Armistice. His position in Scouting led to financial and marital difficulties: he himself complained that he was underpaid, and his wife did not care much for Scouting. The marriage eventually \\"foundered\\". They had at least three children, one of whom died in 1921. His son, Alan Francis Gidney, later became an officer in the 10th Gurkha Rifles and was mentioned in dispatches during the Burma Campaign. Gidney established the nom de plume of \\"Gilcraft\\" which he used when writing articles in The Scout and the Headquarters Gazette, also in several instructional books and booklets for both adult Scouters and boys. The pseudonym continued to be used by his successors at Gilwell in the interwar period. It was his idea to start the 1st Gilwell Scout Troop (today the 1st Gilwell Park Scout Group) for all Wood Badge holders, with its distinctive neckerchief, and he successfully established the pattern still used for modern-day Gilwell Reunions. Disputes over how Gilwell Park should be managed led to Gidney resigning in 1923, which greatly upset the founder of the Scouting movement, Robert Baden-Powell. Gidney then worked as a Master at a preparatory school in Bournemouth, before retiring due to ill health. He died from complications to his war wounds in 1928 at the age of 38. The Frank Gidney Memorial Cabin was built at Gilwell by Don Potter, one of the staff members, who had been given his first set of woodworking tools by Gidney. The cabin was opened by Baden-Powell on Easter Sunday, 1930.

Geography Goujounac is located in the Lot valley about 30 km to the west of Cahors and 9 km south of Cazals. It makes up for one point in a quiet triangle of villages in the Lot, the others being Frayssinet-le-Gelat and the smaller Pomarede, both away. Situated southeast of Goujounac lies Cahors, the Lot's largest town. Closer to hand are the pleasantly sleepy market towns of Puy-l'eveque and Prayssac, both roughly away. Sights Architecturally, Goujounac is very traditional in style and therefore akin to many of the villages in this corner of the Lot. Presenting pretty, well-preserved stone houses and barns along the main road with further reaches of the village also well maintained, the village has a number of simply preserved back streets to wander. The centre of the village is dominated by its ancient 12th century Romanesque church, evidence in itself that Goujounac has been a community for many years. Demographics Most of the village's 250 population are French, though there are Portuguese, British, Belgian and Dutch living here and in nearby areas now as well. The village is a quiet place in the evenings and it sees much passing trade during the day throughout the summer as it is situated on the D660 which runs north to south. Although the road occasionally becomes fairly busy during the peak tourist months, traffic never becomes sufficiently heavy to be considered a disturbance. As with many places around here, its population increases with the coming of summer and 'les grandes vacances', but its quiet charm never really succumbs at all. Amenities There is a swimming pool and a campsite with tennis courts at the top of the village, about 5 minutes walk from the centre. There has been no commercial centre to Goujounac.

News reports of his death confused him with the food writer of the same name.Prolific British writer Behr dies at 81 Biography His parents were of Russian-Jewish descent, and he had a bilingual education at the Lycée Janson- de-Sailly and St Paul's School, London. He enlisted in the British Indian Army on leaving school, serving in Intelligence in the North-West Frontier from 1944 to 1948 and rising to acting brigade major in the Royal Garhwal Rifles at the age of 22. He then took a degree in history at Magdalene College, Cambridge. Edward Behr is survived by his wife, Christiane. Career= Reporting  His early career as a reporter was with Reuters in London and Paris. He then became press officer with Jean Monnet at the European Coal and Steel Community in Luxembourg from 1954 to 1956. Later he joined Time-Life as Paris correspondent, and in the late 1950s and early 1960s often covered the fighting in the Congo, the civil war in Lebanon as well as the Indo-Chinese border clashes of 1962. He wrote about the unrest in Ulster, the fighting in Angola and the Moroccan attack on Ifni, the Spanish enclave in West Africa. Behr was often in Algeria, and in 1958 published The Algerian Problem. The book had the virtue of being written by a French-speaking outsider with some understanding of, and sympathy for, the positions of both the French and the Algerians. Written when the war was far from over, and going back a century or more over the background, it was considered a fair assessment of a problem which many Frenchmen reckoned no foreigner could possibly understand. The book was said to be compulsory reading at the United States Department of State. Returning to India for Time magazine, Behr served as bureau chief in New Delhi, travelled in Indo-China, then moved to the mass-circulation American magazine Saturday Evening Post as roving correspondent. In 1965 he went to Newsweek, the weekly news magazine owned by the Washington Post Company. Operating from Hong Kong as Asia bureau chief, Behr wrote on China's Cultural Revolution, secured an interview with Mao Zedong and reported from Vietnam. The year 1968 turned out to be a hectic one for Behr: he was in Saigon during the Tet offensive, in Paris for the student riots and in Prague when it was occupied by the Russians.  Biographies and television  Behr turned gradually from a career in war reporting to writing books and making television documentaries, including award-winning programmes on India, Ireland and the Kennedy family. A notable production was The American Way of Death, Behr's look at America's undertaking industry. Later came a documentary for BBC1 on Emperor Hirohito, and the three-part Red Dynasty for BBC2 on the murders in Tiananmen Square and the developments in communist China that led up to the massacre. In his book Hirohito: Behind the Myth Behr went into the debate about what the emperor knew about war preparations, about the rape of Nanking, the Bataan death march, the Burma railway and Changi prison. Behr's case was that Hirohito knew as long ago as 1931 - when his troops took control of Manchuria in the putsch that became known as the Mukden Incident - what his military chiefs were doing; that he encouraged it; and that he was fully aware of their preparations for the Second World War. In his book on the Ceauşescus, Behr said that the couple established a dictatorship more Byzantine than Marxist–Leninist. The title, Kiss the Hand You Cannot Bite, was a Romanian proverb. Behr's biography of Pu Yi, The Last Emperor (1987) - Pu Yi survived the Cultural Revolution and ended his life as a gardener - won Behr the Gutenberg Prize. In 1978 he published his memoirs. Memorably entitled Anyone Here Been Raped and Speaks English?, it was retitled more blandly for the American market as Bearings: A Foreign Correspondent's Life Behind the Lines. In a thriller, Getting Even (1981), Behr used his foreign correspondent experience. He was the author (with Sydney Liu) of The Thirty-Sixth Way: A Personal Account of Imprisonment and Escape from Red China (1969), wrote a book on the musical Les Misèrables and collaborated on another about the making of Miss Saigon. He also wrote Thank Heaven for Little Girls: The True Story of Maurice Chevalier's Life and Times (1993). He contributed regularly to American, French and British periodicals.

Etymology The city was mentioned for the first time as Otemochow in 1155. It was named in its Old Polish form Othmuchow in the 13th-century Book of Henryków.Gustav Adolf Stenzel, Liber Fundationis Claustri Sanctae Mariae Virginis in Henrichow, 1854, p. 82 The name Othmuchow was also listed in the Chronicles of the Kingdom of Poland written in the years 1455-1480 by Jan Długosz and the Latinized name Othmuchouie appeared in the Statuta synodalia episcoporum Wratislaviensium from 1475. In 1613 the Silesian regionalist and historian Nicholas Henkel stated in his own work entitled Fri Silesiographia two names in Latin, Otmuchovia and Othmuchaw. The Germanized form was Ottmachau, and the Polish name in the modern Polish spelling was restored in 1945. History Medieval Otmuchów Castle The first known mentioning of Otmuchów comes from 1155, however, it certainly existed, along with the castle, already in the 11th century. It was a seat of a castellany within medieval Poland ruled by the Piast dynasty. It was a property of the Diocese of Wrocław and a result of the fragmentation of Poland, it formed part of the Duchy of Nysa. In the 14th century the city was surrounded by defensive walls. Establishment of the coat of arms of the city dates back to 1347, when Bishop of Wrocław Preczlaw of Pogarell vested Otmuchów with town rights. The coat of arms is an open city gate in white on a blue field. From the 14th century it was used as the town seal. Destroyed by many wars throughout history, the town lost its importance due to a nearby developing city of Nysa, which was the capital of the principality of the bishop. In 1428, 1430 and 1443 the town was captured by the Hussites. In the 15th century conflicts occurred between indigenous Poles and German settlers. Germans tried to oust the Polish language from local churches. Local Polish church superior lodged a complaint against a German priest who threatened to expel Poles from the church. Otmuchów coat of arms at the medieval castle The town was plundered during the Thirty Years' War. After the war the town was revived thanks to Polish prince and Bishop of Wrocław Karol Ferdynand Vasa, who turned the castle into an episcopal seat. In 1741 the town was captured and plundered by the Prussians, who annexed it afterwards. The town declined, and after secularization in 1810 it passed from episcopal authority under Prussian administration. Between 1871 and 1945 the area was part of Germany. During the Second World War a German prisoner-of-war camp (E276) was based here, at a sugar beet factory. The camp came under the administration of Stalag VIII-B/344 at Łambinowice (then Lamsdorf), a camp for English-speaking prisoners of war. In 1944 the men were transferred to the oil refinery at Trzebinia (E738).http://www.lamsdorf.com/ The Germans also established the Polenlager 86 Nazi concentration camp for Poles in the town. The town holds the headquarters for the 1952 founded confectionary joint-stock company Otmuchów Group. Sights Among the historic sights of Otmuchów are the medieval Otmuchów Castle, the Baroque palace, now housing the municipal government, medieval town walls, the Church of St. Nicholas and St. Francis, and numerous historic townhouses.

It is the highest point in Bedford County. The mountain is the site of Blue Knob State Park and contains approximately 18 miles (29 km) of hiking trails and numerous overlooks. A ski area is located on the mountain's north slopes. The towns of Johnstown, Altoona and Bedford are located within of the mountain. The towns of Pavia and Claysburg lie at the foot of the mountain. Geography The satellite peaks of Blue Knob include: Herman Point 3,034 feet (925 m), Spruce Knob 2,475 feet (754 m), Round Knob 2,791 feet (851 m), Cattle Knob 2,842 feet (866 m), Pine Knob 2,704 feet (824 m), Ritchey Knob 2,865 feet (873 m) and Schaefer Head 2,950 feet (899 m). Summits to the north include Brush Mountain (17 miles), Schaefer Head (2.5 miles) and the other satellite peaks listed above, The \\"Loop\\" in Tussey Mountain (27 miles) and Lock Mountain (13 miles). To the east the views are of Dunning Mountain (7 miles), Tussey Mountain (16 miles), Jacks Mountain with Butler Knob (31 miles), Sideling Hill (28 miles), and on the distant horizon Big Mountain (41 miles) and the Tuscarora Mountain Ridge. To the south are Wills Mountain (32 miles), Savage Mountain (28 miles) and Bald Knob on the Allegheny Front (20 miles). The town of Bedford is hidden by Kinton Knob (18 miles). The views west include Laurel Hill with the Conemaugh Gorge (22 miles), and the Allegheny Plateau. ;Drainages A few of the major streams are Big Lick Branch, Rhodes Run, Pavia Run, Deep Hollow Run, Scubgrass Creek, Beaverdam Creek and Little Beaverdam Creek. Bob's Creek which is in the valley below the mountain is a \\"Class A\\" trout stream and popular among local fisherman. Adjacent to the mountain on the Allegheny Front are Big Break Hollow and Wallacks Branch, portions of these streams are located within the State Park boundary. Geology The Blue Knob massif from Chimney Rocks Blue Knob and its subsidiary peaks form a grouping of mountains that stand out as a massif from the rest of the Allegheny Front and form some of the highest elevations in Pennsylvania's Allegheny Mountains. Blue Knob is separate from the rest of the Allegheny Front escarpment, and the mountain's lower base is made up of siltstone and shale of the Devonian Catskill and Devonian- Mississippian Rockwell formations. The upper slopes and summit are made up of the buff-colored Mississippian Burgoon Formation of sandstone and conglomerate, which is far more resistant to weathering than the underlying shale and siltstone. The rocks near the summit have a bluish-green appearance, giving Blue Knob its name. History The west aspect of Blue Knob receives prevailing winds. (Photo taken from meadow at 2,400 ft.) Blue Knob was thought to be the highest mountain in Pennsylvania until 1921, when the U.S. Geological Survey determined a summit of was higher (later named Mount Davis). In the 1950s the summit was cleared of vegetation and was the location of Claysburg Air Force Station until it was deactivated in 1961. Shortly afterward the Blue Knob Ski area was developed. Signs from the former station remain on the summit, and one building remains as a ski lodge. Ski lifts, a ski lodge and a couple of maintenance structures occupy the broad summit of Blue Knob, and a few ski chalets are downhill of the bald summit. Climate Looking down the Big Lick Branch drainage from the upper slopes of Blue Knob The state record snowfall of was recorded on Blue Knob during the winter of 1890–91. In December 1890 alone, fell on the mountain. Average snowfall is about annually, while temperatures usually are cooler than in the surrounding towns. Blue Knob's weather can be attributed to its aspect and elevation. The mountain rises approximately above the plateaus to the west, and over above the lowlands to the east. The prevailing winds hit the mountain's slopes, accelerating up and over its bald summit. It is these conditions that can cause wind chill factors to dip below zero during the winter months. Vegetation View from the Pavia overlook Salvage operation after 2004 wind storm Eastern Hemlock trees are located along streams of the mountain's lower slopes, and the drier east and southeast face of the mountain is predominantly a Red and White oak and maple mix, with grapevines and some exotic invasive species where there are holes in the canopy. The north and west faces of the mountain contain Tulip poplar, American Beech and other associated hardwoods due to the richer soils. The upper slopes of the mountain have Black Cherry, Striped Maple, Scrub Oak and a forest floor of blueberry and fern. Over the contour the trees are distinctively stunted due to the winds and fierce weather. In September 2004, during Hurricane Ivan, strong winds streamed through the saddle between Herman Point and Blue Knob. Many of the larger trees were blown down, opening holes in the forest canopy. Wildlife Wildlife is abundant on the slopes of Blue Knob. Species such as white-tailed deer, ruffed grouse, turkey, coyote, porcupine and fox are difficult to see, but finding their tracks in the snow is not uncommon. Black bears are also resident on the mountain and are more likely to be seen during the early morning and evening hours. Red-tailed hawks, warblers, vireos and songbirds are found here throughout the seasons. Adjacent to the state park is the Pennsylvania State Game Lands No. 26. This area combined with the park creates an area of over of public land. There are a few areas in Blue Knob State Park which are closed to hunting (see park map). Hikers need to be extremely careful during the hunting season in late November and through December.  References  *Alan R.

Integrated with Beowulf-style commodity computers, the GRAPE system calculates the force of gravity that a given mass, such as a star, exerts on others. The project resides at Tokyo University. The GRAPE hardware acceleration component \\"pipes\\" the force computation to the general-purpose computer serving as a node in a parallelized cluster as the innermost loop of the gravitational model. Its shortened name, GRAPE, was chosen as an intentional reference to the Apple Inc. line of computers.  Method  The primary calculation in GRAPE hardware is a summation of the forces between a particular star and every other star in the simulation. Several versions (GRAPE-1, GRAPE-3 and GRAPE-5) use the Logarithmic Number System (LNS) in the pipeline to calculate the approximate force between two stars, and take the antilogarithms of the x, y and z components before adding them to their corresponding total. The GRAPE-2, GRAPE-4 and GRAPE-6 use floating point arithmetic for more accurate calculation of such forces. The advantage of the logarithmic-arithmetic versions is they allow more and faster parallel pipes for a given hardware cost because all but the sum portion of the GRAPE algorithm (1.5 power of the sum of the squares of the input data divided by the input data) is easy to perform with LNS. GRAPE-DR consists of a large number of simple processors, all operating in the SIMD fashion.  Application  GRAPE has been used in simulations of planetary formation GRAPE computes approximate solutions to the historically intractable n-body problem, which is of interest in astrophysics and celestial mechanics. n refers to the number of celestial bodies in a given problem. While the 2-body problem was solved by Kepler's Laws in the 17th century, any calculation where n > 2 has historically been a nigh-impossible challenge. An analytical solution exists for n = 3 although the resulting series converges too slowly to be of practical use. For n > 2 solutions are generally calculated numerically by determining the interaction between all particles. Thus, the calculation scales as n². GRAPE assists in calculations of interactions between particles where the interaction scales as x−2. This dependence is hardwired, drastically improving calculation times. These problems include the evolution of galaxies (gravitation force scales as r−2). Similar problems exist in molecular chemistry and biology, where the force considered would be electrical rather than gravitational. In 1999 Marseilles Observatory published a study on simulating the formation of proto-planets and plantessimals with a large planetary body. This simulation used the GRAPE-4 system.  Prizes  The LNS- based GRAPE-5 architecture won the Price Performance category of the Gordon Bell Prize in 1999, at about $7 per MegaFLOPS. This category measures the price efficiency of a particular machine in terms of the price in dollars per megaFLOPS. The particular implementation \\"Grape-6\\" also won prizes in 2000 and 2001 (see external links). Grape-DR was ranked first in the June 2010 Little Green500 List, a ranking of supercomputer's performance per unit power consumption published by the Green500.org.

The movie is the story of actor Sam Lawson (Franciosa) who is bent on breaking into the big time at any cost, braving World War II, the Korean War and even the blacklist. The film is based on the play written by James Lee, which premiered at the off-Broadway Seventh Avenue South Playhouse in New York City in 1957.https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-cast-staff/james-lee-102138 In turn, the play is loosely based on the 1936 novel of the same name by Phil Stong, which had been previously adapted for the screen in 1939 by Dalton Trumbo and Bert Granet. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031139/?ref_=ttfc_fc_tt Lee adapted his own play for the 1959 version. The film was nominated for three Academy Awards and won one Golden Globe Award. Plot Back from action in World War II, Sam Lawson (Tony Franciosa, who has second billing in the film despite being in every scene) leaves home and friends in Lansing, Michigan to fulfil his ambitions to make it as an actor in New York. After many auditions he joins the off-Broadway grassroots theatre group called the Actors' Rostrum, run by actor-director Maurice \\"Maury\\" Novak (Dean Martin) out of a seamen's mission in Greenwich Village. When the theatre group runs out of money, Novak leaves the theater eventually to become a well known Hollywood director. Both men know Sharon Kensington (Shirley MacLaine), who is the alcoholic daughter of powerful Broadway producer Robert Kensington (Robert Middleton). Lawson continually tries to establish himself as an actor, suffering the slings and arrows of rejection despite his dedication and passion for the theater. It costs him his first wife, played by Joan Blackman. Lawson's long-suffering agent Shirley Drake (Carolyn Jones) attempts to get him work and after marrying Sharon Kensington and with the grudging backing of his new father-in- law, Lawson's star slowly begins to rise. But Sharon is in love with Novak and pregnant with his child. Lawson makes a deal to give her a divorce for the lead in the new Novak production. But Novak reneges on the deal. After more struggle, Drake manages to find Lawson a job but he has been called up from the reserves to serve in Korea, where he sees out the end of the war. Lawson returns to the rounds of auditions in New York. Just as he's about to land a long-term TV announcing job, his loyalty is researched and to Lawson's shock he is found to be on the blacklist. This is owing to his connection with Novak and the allegedly \\"subversive\\" theater work of the Actors' Rostrum. Drake explains, \\"Sam, these are very responsible, patriotic people. They're just trying to protect their country.\\" The now blacklisted Lawson, reflecting the realities of real-life blacklisted actors, is forced to take work as a waiter. When Drake asks him what he's going to do, Lawson replies: \\"There's only one thing for me to do. Survive.\\" In one sense this was among Hollywood's first direct documentations of the blacklist in a dramatic film. Novak, himself on the skids, appears back in Lawson's life, vowing to start fresh with a new off-Broadway theater. Novak confesses that he was briefly a communist in the past, but for opportunistic, career reasons. He offers Lawson a chance to work together again. After an accidental meeting with his first wife, who now understands Lawson's ambition, Lawson quits restaurant work and accepts the offer. With the blacklist past, the new play becomes successful and heads to Broadway. With Lawson finally emerging as a major actor, Drake, who has fallen in love with Lawson, asks him in the final scene, thinking of his struggles and humiliation, if it was \\"worth it.\\" \\"Yes,\\" says Lawson. \\"It was worth it.\\" Cast * Dean Martin as Maury Novak * Tony Franciosa as Sam Lawson * Shirley MacLaine as Sharon Kensington * Carolyn Jones as Shirley Drake * Joan Blackman as Barbara Lawson Helmsley * Robert Middleton as Robert Kensington * Donna Douglas as Marjorie Burke * Jerry Paris as Allan Burke * Frank McHugh as Charlie * Chuck Wassil as Eric Peters * Mary Treen as Marie, secretary to Shirley Drake * Alan Hewitt as Matt Helmsley * Marjorie Bennett as Columnist Awards The film won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama (Franciosa) The film was nominated for three Academy Awards: * Best Art Direction (Hal Pereira, Walter H.

St Peter's School was founded by Archbishop Amigo in 1947 and named St. Peter's his patron saint. It was housed in two buildings. One was the present site on Horseshoe Lane East and the other in Horseshoe Lane West. The Headmaster and a number of the teachers were Diocesan Priests. Merrow Grange was on the corner of Horseshoe Lane East and the Epsom Road. In October 1945 it was purchased by the Ladies of Mary (who later became the Daughters of Mary and Joseph) and became an independent girls school called Merrow Grange.

Curriculum issues  The variable political history of Pakistan shows the country being ruled alternately by the civilian and military leaderships. This lack of political succession has had its effects on the way the history was depicted in the curricula of Pakistan Studies until 2006, which increasingly portrayed what Rubina Saigol termed as 'glorification of military'.Saigol, R.

The report recommended for major structural reforms and establishment of a National Education Advisory Board to centralise the curriculum development and carry out regular revisions.Nayyar and Salim (2003). pp. ix–xi About the international perception of the subject, Burzine Waghmar of the School of Oriental and African Studies argues that Pakistan Studies is increasingly perceived with sonorous sessions on weapons control, civil unrest, bonded labour, gender inequality and the like.Waghmar, B.

'Vituperative animosities legitimise military and autocratic rule, nurturing a siege mentality. Pakistan Studies textbooks are an active site to represent India as a hostile neighbour' the report stated. 'The story of Pakistan's past is intentionally written to be distinct from, and often in direct contrast with, interpretations of history found in India.

He played college basketball for Texas A&M; University. King holds numerous Big 12 Conference and Texas A&M; records. King left A&M; as the top scorer in Big 12 conference history, as well as third in the league for all-time career assists. He led the Aggies in scoring and assists in all four of his seasons, and ranks among Texas A&M;'s all-time leaders in points (first), three-point field goals made (first), and assists (second). Early years Bernard King was born in Gibsland, Louisiana, the son of Victor King, a former Louisiana Tech basketball player and second-round NBA draft pick by the Los Angeles Lakers from Newellton, Louisiana and Vernita King. From the time young Bernard learned to walk, he would accompany his father to the gym, and began to express an interest in playing with the basketball too. When he was eight, King's parents brought him to basketball camps run by Louisiana Tech and the Dallas Mavericks. Organizers of those camps realized quickly that King played at a much higher level than others in his age group, and recommended that he instead play in the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU). By the time he was in eighth grade, King was playing alongside high-school juniors and seniors. When given the opportunity to play in place of a guard who had fouled out, King sank three three-pointers in a row, helping his team to win the game. As a 14-year- old, he played on an AAU team for 17-year-olds, scoring six three-pointers in one game in the state playoffs before helping the team to win a national championship. King played with the varsity all four years of his career at Gibsland-Coleman Complex High School, helping them to a 143–34 record in that time period. In his career, he accumulated 4,018 points, more than 1,000 rebounds, and 1348 assists. In his senior year, King averaged 28.9 points, 8.3 rebounds, 11.2 assists, 5.4 steals, and 3.7 blocks, leading the team to the state championship, the school's first since 1984. He earned 1998 AAU All- America honors, and was named Louisiana Mr. Basketball by the Louisiana Sports Writers Association. Despite the time involved in maintaining his dual basketball careers, King made sure to devote enough time to his academic career, graduating from high school with a 3.8 GPA. Bob Gibbons named King the 33rd best prospect in the country, and almost every major recruiting service ranked him as one of the top 75 prospects.

Chalker created an endowment for the high school when schools in the township agreed to consolidate smaller schools in a central location. The town agreed to consolidation, and the original campus was completed in 1907, consisting of the Chalker High School building and a smaller elementary school. Newton Chalker agreed to pay for Chalker High school, as long as the townspeople would pay for the elementary school building, which was not nearly as grand, totaling $6000 as compared to the Chalker Building's $20,000. The high school was constructed in the Neoclassical Revival architectural style, including fluted columns and a pedimented gable.

Mongewell is on the east bank of the Thames, linked with the west bank at Winterbrook by Winterbrook Bridge. The earthwork Grim's Ditch, now part of The Ridgeway long- distance footpath, passes through the northern part of it and is a scheduled ancient monument. History The ancient earthwork of Grim's Ditch has its main section north of the village, a Scheduled Ancient Monument.Grim's Ditch - section from the south of Mongewell Park Lodge to the south of Nuffield Church In order to provide a level climb up to the first major hill of the long Chiltern Hills range to the east and northeast, this has embankments and cuttings, with thousands of tonnes of earth displaced perhaps in the Bronze Age in order to facilitate access by foot. The place-name 'Mongewell' is first attested in an Anglo-Saxon will circa 966-75, where it appears as Mundingwillæ. It appears as Mongewel in the Domesday Book of 1086, and as Mungewell in the Book of Fees in 1242. The name means 'the spring or stream of Munda's people'.Eilert Ekwall, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place- names, p.329. The parish of Mongewell was mentioned in the Domesday Book. The parish church of St John the Baptist dates architecturally to the 12th century, with later repairs and additions.Church of St John the Baptist Mongewell was a strip parish, a thin strip of land extending into the Chiltern HillsVision of Britain: Boundary map including part of Stoke Row. The ecclesiastical parish was joined by a civil parish in the 19th century, but in 1932 was split, mostly joining a new civil parish named Crowmarsh, but a small part was added to Rotherfield Greys parish.Vision of Britain website Mongewell Park Mongewell Park was once home to Shute Barrington, Bishop of Llandaff (1769–1782). Replacing the original Georgian Mongewell House of Barrington, a large brick mansion in William and Mary style was built in 1890 for Alexander Frazer whose initials can be seen on the lodge gates (Pedgley and Pedgley, 1990). After Fraser died in 1916, the house became a hospital for wounded officers in World War I. In 1918, it was sold to the American millionaire Howard Gould. Because he was an atheist, he had the lane to the now ruined Mongewell church sunk so that he would not see the parishioners attending service. He sold the house in 1939 and the Royal Air Force occupied it until 1945. In January 1944 it became the Headquarters for No 2 Group RAF of Bomber Command led by Air Vice Marshal Basil Embry. On the Staff there for six months before his capture as a POW was the World War II night fighter ace, Wing Commander Bob Braham (Braham, 1984). At the end of the war the house was once more used as a hospital before becoming derelict. A Jewish boarding school, Carmel College, occupied Mongewell Park from 1948 to 1997. The school added several buildings, including its synagogue and the Julius Gottlieb Gallery and Boathouse, which were later listed.The Gallery building As of June 2007, it was planned to redevelop the site for housing.

Form and process  A panel can range in size from 100 to 100,000 or more people. Larger panels can enable surveys of smaller target groups. Panel quality is not determined solely by size, however, and how panel members have been sourced is also important. Panels can provide a dedicated group that market researchers can engage with and learn from over time. At a moment’s notice researchers can investigate the attitudes, behaviour and opinions of existing or potential customers using interactive surveys, discussion forums and 3D retail environments. Plus, results are available instantly and responses can be tracked over time. Panels are a growing phenomenon in the market research industry. They bridge the gap between a population that is reluctant to cooperate with telephone surveys and the organizations that need to know their perceptions and attitudes more than ever before.

Statutory reserves are a type of actuarial reserve. Purpose Statutory reserves are intended to ensure that insurance companies are able to meet future obligations created by insurance policies. These reserves must be reported in statements filed with insurance regulatory bodies. They are calculated with a certain level of conservatism in order to protect policyholders and beneficiaries. Methods There are two types of methods for calculation of statutory reserves. Reserve methodology may be fully prescribed by law, which is often called formula-based reserving. This is in contrast to principles-based reserves, where actuaries are given latitude to use professional judgement in determining methodology and assumptions for reserve calculation. In the United States, where formula-based reserves are used, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners plans to implement principles-based reserves in 2017. Life insurance in the United States In the U.S. life insurance industry, statutory reserves are most commonly computed using the Commissioner's Reserve Valuation Method, or CRVM, the method prescribed by law for computing minimum required reserves. The size of a CRVM reserve, as with most life reserves, is affected by the age and sex of the insured person, how long the policy for which it is computed has been in force, the plan of insurance offered by the policy, the rate of interest used in the calculation, and the mortality table with which the actuarial present values are computed. The Commissioner's Reserve Valuation Method was itself established by the Standard Valuation Law (SVL), which was created by the NAIC and adopted by the several states shortly after World War II. The first mortality table prescribed by the SVL was the 1941 CSO (Commissioner's Standard Ordinary) table,The 1941 CSO table was prescribed for policies of ordinary life insurance. For policies of industrial life insurance the SVL prescribed use of the 1941 CSI (Commissioner's Standard Industrial) table. at a maximum interest rate of 3½%. Subsequent amendments to the Standard Valuation Law have permitted the use of more modern mortality tables and higher rates of interest. The effect of these changes has in general been to reduce the amount of the reserves which life insurance companies are legally required to hold.

Andrew Graham was born in 1733, probably in the vicinity of Edinburgh. He emigrated to Canada and worked for the Hudson's Bay Company from 1749 to 1775. His first assignment was to the company's most northerly trading station at Prince of Wales's Fort, now known as Churchill, Manitoba. There he served on three summer expeditions on board the sloop Churchill which traded with the Inuit who inhabited the northern parts of Hudson Bay. In 1753 he gained the position of assistant writer at York Factory in Manitoba, here he impressed the chief factor James Isham and was appointed to positions of higher responsibility. In 1761 he became master at Fort Severn in Ontario where apart from the seasons 1765–66 and 1771–72 when he was acting chief at York, and 1769–70 when he was on leave he remained until 1774. In March 1774 he returned to Prince of Wales's Fort as chief factor and remained there until August 1775 when he retired and returned to Scotland. As a naturalist, his principal contribution was a series of manuscript called “Observations” penned by Graham from 1767 onwards. These may have been a continuation of notes made by Isham in the 1740s. Among the subjects covered are stories of life at the company's posts on Hudson's Bay, trade lists, meteorological and astronomical observations, some transcripts of diaries written by explorers hired by the company explorers, and the first known vocabularies of local First Nations languages. Although, these short vocabularies were obtained second hand from other company men, as Graham never travelled into the interior. Altculture at this time. Most importantly, Graham's writings have lengthy sections on the natural history of the bay region, with the greatest details on the bird. From 1770 he was also able to collect many specimens, mainly birds, and have these sent to London, many of them being described by Johann Reinhold Forster. Graham was assisted at times by fur trader and company surgeon Thomas Hutchins, who also worked on meteorological problems who may have plagiarised much of Graham's work. Graham had a tangled personal life and was married at least twice, marrying Patricia Shere in Edinburgh in 1770, he was also married to a Barbara Bowie at some point, and when he retired two mixed-blood children accompanied him back to Scotland. When he died in Prestonpans in 1815, his will indicates he was a relatively wealthy man.

It had great chance to win parliament elections in 1998. The leaders of this coalition were chiefs of respective parties, with Mikuláš Dzurinda as its speaker. The ruling government coalition with the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia as a leader, in response passed a law, which restricted candidature of such coalitions. As a reaction of passing an \\"anti-coalition\\" law, the SDK transferred itself from electoral coalition into a political party with 150 members, with each one being a candidate into the parliament. SDK in government Although Movement for a Democratic Slovakia narrowly won the parliamentary election in 1998 with 27% of the vote, it was unable to form a government coalition. Instead, the SDK, which finished second with 26.33% of the vote formed government coalition with three other parties - Party of the Democratic Left (SDĽ) (14.66%), Party of the Hungarian Coalition (SMK) (9.12%) and Party of Civic Understanding (SOP) (8.01%).

His grandfather, Gaston Maspero, who died before his birth, was a famous Egyptologist. François Maspero opened a book store in the Latin Quarter in 1955, at the age of 23. Éditions Maspero In 1959, in the middle of the Algerian War, he and Marie-Thérèse Maugis formed the Maspero publishing house, Éditions François Maspero. They later were joined by Jean-Philippe Bernigaud and Fanchita Gonzalez Batlle, and then by Émile Copfermann. Their first two collections, \\"Cahiers libres\\" and \\"Textes à l'appui\\", focused on the Algerian War from an anti-colonialist perspective, and on contestation of the French Communist Party's unreformed Stalinism. Maspero published Frantz Fanon's The Wretched of the Earth (1961), censored by the French authorities, with a preface by Jean-Paul Sartre, as well as Fanon's L'An V de la Révolution algérienne. Maspero published other testimonies on Algeria, including investigations of the use of torture by the French Army, also censored. Besides facing lawsuits as a result of his courageous publishing decisions, Maspero was the target of bomb attacks. He republished Paul Nizan's Les Chiens de garde and Aden Arabie, also with a preface by Sartre. Then he created the review Partisans, which survived until 1973. Many important writers first came to public attention through the \\"Cahiers libres\\" collection, such as Régis Debray, published in 1967 or Bernard-Henri Lévy in 1973. Georges Perec published his first texts in Partisans.

Highway 3A splits to the north from Highway 3 and runs through the Hamlet of Monarch along the Canadian Pacific Railway tracks, before merging with Highway 23 and rejoining Highway 3 at a point west of Lethbridge. The third segment of Highway 3A provides access to west Lethbridge. It diverges from Highway 3 southeast of Coalhurst, in the form of a Y interchange running for only as Westside Drive in the County of Lethbridge to the city limit where the Highway 3A designation ends. The fourth and easternmost segment is also an original alignment of Highway 3, passing through the centre of Barnwell. The town was bypassed to the south when twinning of Highway 3 was extended to Taber.

The group became Xtatik in 1989. Their early albums Breaking Out (1990) and One Step Ahead (1991) were both locally successful, and the band had several hit singles in Trinidad & Tobago. In 1991 they recruited guitarist Roger George and moved to a sound that fused Soca and dancehall. Several albums followed in this vein and the band won road march titles at carnivals in Caribana and Miami in 1994. In 1995 they successfully blended soca and house on \\"Come Dig It\\", giving them exposure in the United States.

It is located along Interstate 15 approximately 10 miles northeast of Mesquite, Nevada. It is located in the 86432 ZIP Code. It had a population of 1,962 as of the 2010 census. Beaver Dam and neighboring Littlefield and Scenic have the distinction of being the only towns in Arizona along I-15. Owing to their location in the Arizona Strip, northwest of Grand Canyon National Park and west of the Virgin River, they are isolated by hundreds of miles from the rest of the state. Travel to other towns within Arizona requires crossing through either Nevada or Utah, or routing through unpaved roads to the rest of Arizona's road network. History The site of Beaver Dam was located along the pack horse route of the Old Spanish Trail from 1828 and the later wagon route of the Mormon Road between Salt Lake City and Los Angeles from 1847. Beaver Dam Creek and subsequently the town was named for a beaver dam that occupied and held back the waters on the wash when the first Mormon party under Jefferson Hunt established the wagon road through the area in 1847. The Mormon Road was used by Forty-niners in 1849 and Mormon colonists and other travelers from then on. Both routes passed southward from the Beaver Dam Mountains, to the Virgin River along Beaver Dam Wash to where it met the river. From 1855, the road was a major wagon freighting road until the railroad arrived in Nevada in 1905. Beaver Dam was first settled by Mormon colonists in 1863.

These included the Cyprus Emergency of 1955–59 during British rule, the post-independence Cyprus crisis of 1963–64, and the Cyprus crisis of 1967. Hostilities culminated in the 1974 de facto division of the island along the Green Line following the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. The region has been relatively peaceful since then, but the Cyprus dispute has continued, with various attempts to solve it diplomatically having been generally unsuccessful. Background Cyprus, an island lying in the eastern Mediterranean, hosted a population of Greeks and Turks (four-fifths and one- fifth, respectively), who lived under British rule in the early 20th century. Christian Orthodox Church of Cyprus played a prominent political role among the Greek Cypriot community, a privilege that it acquired during the Ottoman Empire with the employment of the millet system, which gave the archbishop an unofficial ethnarch status. Enosis and taksim The repeated rejections by the British of Greek Cypriot demands for enosis, union with Greece, led to armed resistance, organised by the National Organization of Cypriot Struggle, or EOKA.\\"Cyprus,\\" Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2007. Archived 2009-10-31. EOKA, led by the Greek-Cypriot commander George Grivas, systematically targeted British colonial authorities. One of the effects of EOKA's campaign was to alter the Turkish position from demanding full reincorporation into Turkey to a demand for taksim (partition). EOKA's mission and activities caused a \\"Cretan syndrome\\" (see Turkish Resistance Organisation) within the Turkish Cypriot community, as its members feared that they would be forced to leave the island in such a case as was the case with Cretan Turks. As such, they preferred the continuation of the British rule and then taksim, the division of the island. Due to the Turkish Cypriots' support for the British, EOKA's leader, Georgios Grivas, declared them to be enemies.Sachenko, Daria (2012). The Making of Informal States: Statebuilding in Northern Cyprus and Transdniestria. Palgrave Macmillan. The fact that the Turks were a minorityDavid French, p. 255 was, according to Nihat Erim, to be addressed by the transfer of thousands of Turks from mainland Turkey so that Greek Cypriots would cease to be the majority. When Erim visited Cyprus as the Turkish representative, he was advised by the then British Governor John Harding that Turkey should send educated Turks to settle in Cyprus.Copeaux, Etienne, Aedelsa TUR. Taksim Chypre divisee. Turkey actively promoted the idea that on the island of Cyprus two distinctive communities existed, and sidestepped its former claim that “the people of Cyprus were all Turkish subjects”.cyprus-conflict.net In doing so, Turkey’s aim to have self- determination of two to-be equal communities in effect led to de jure partition of the island. This could be justified to the international community against the will of the majority Greek population of the island. Dr. Fazil Küçük in 1954 had already proposed Cyprus be divided in two at the 35° parallel.Dr. Fazil Küçük, 1957. The Cyprus Question: A permanent solution.  Causes of intercommunal violence  Lindley Dan, from Notre Dame University, spotted the roots of intercommunal violence to different visions among the two communities of Cyprus (enosis for Greek Cypriots, taksim for Turkish Cypriots). Also, Lindlay wrote that \\"the merging of church, schools/education, and politics in divisive and nationalistic ways\\" had played a crucial role in creation of havoc in Cyprus' history. Attalides Michael also pointed to the opposing nationalism as the cause of the Cyprus problem.  Crisis of 1955–1959  The British started recruiting Turkish Cypriots into the police force that patrolled Cyprus to fight the EOKA. EOKA targeted colonial authorities, including police, but Georgios Grivas, the leader of EOKA, did not initially wish to open up a new front by fighting Turkish Cypriots and reassured them that EOKA would not harm their people. In 1956, some Turkish Cypriot policemen were killed by EOKA members and this provoked some intercommunal violence in the spring and summer, but these attacks on policemen were not motivated by the fact that they were Turkish Cypriots. However, in January 1957, Grivas changed his policy as his forces in the mountains became increasingly pressured by the British forces. In order to divert the attention of the British forces, EOKA members started to target Turkish Cypriot policemen intentionally in the towns, so that Turkish Cypriots would riot against the Greek Cypriots and the security forces would have to be diverted to the towns to restore order. The killing of a Turkish Cypriot policeman on 19 January, when a power station was bombed, and the injury of three others, provoked three days of intercommunal violence in Nicosia. The two communities targeted each other in reprisals, at least one Greek Cypriot was killed and the army was deployed in the streets. Greek Cypriot stores were burned and their neighbourhoods attacked. Following the events, the Greek Cypriot leadership spread the propaganda that the riots had merely been an act of Turkish Cypriot aggression. Such events created chaos and drove the communities apart both in Cyprus and in Turkey.Crawshaw, Nancy. The Cyprus revolt : an account of the struggle for union with Greece. London : Boston : G. Allen & Unwin, 1978. On 22 October 1957 Sir Hugh Mackintosh Foot replaced Sir John Harding as the British Governor of Cyprus. Foot suggested five to seven years of self-government before any final decision. His plan rejected both enosis and taksim. The Turkish Cypriot response to this plan was a series of anti-British demonstrations in Nicosia on 27 and 28 January 1958 rejecting the proposed plan because the plan did not include partition. The British then withdrew the plan. By 1958 signs of dissatisfaction with the British increased on both sides, with Turkish Cypriots now forming Volkan, later known as the Turkish Resistance Organization paramilitary group to promote partition and the annexation of Cyprus to Turkey as dictated by the Menderes plan. On 27 January 1958 British soldiers opened fire against a crowd of Turkish Cypriot rioters. The events continued until the next day. In June 1958 the British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan was expected to propose a plan to resolve the Cyprus issue. In light of the new development the Turks rioted in Nicosia to promote the idea that Greek and Turkish Cypriots could not live together and therefore any plan that did not include partition would not be viable. This violence was soon followed by bombing, Greek Cypriot deaths and looting of Greek Cypriot-owned stores and houses. Greek and Turkish Cypriots started to flee mixed population villages where they were a minority in search of safety. This was effectively the beginning of segregation of the two communities. On 7 June 1958 a bomb exploded at the entrance of the Turkish Embassy in Cyprus. Following the bombing Turkish Cypriots looted Greek Cypriot properties. On June 26, 1984 the Turkish Cypriot leader, Rauf Denktaş, admitted on British channel ITV that the bomb was placed by the Turks themselves in order to create tension.Arif Hasan Tahsin. \\"He Anodos Tou _Denktas Sten Koryphe\\". January, 2001. 'Denktash admits Turks initiated Cyprus intercommunal violence': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1tUGnWqw2M On January 9, 1995 Rauf Denktaş repeated his claim to the famous Turkish newspaper Milliyet in Turkey. The crisis reached a climax on June 12, 1958 when eight Greeks, out of an armed group of thirty five arrested by soldiers of the Royal Horse Guards on suspicion of preparing an attack on the Turkish quarter of Skylloura, were killed in a suspected attack by Turkish Cypriot locals, near the village of Geunyeli having being ordered to walk back to their village of Kondemenos.The Outbreak of Communal Strife, 1958 The Guardian, London. Republic of Cyprus After the EOKA campaign had begun, the British government successfully began to turn the Cyprus issue from a British colonial problem into a Greek-Turkish issue. British diplomacy exerted backstage influence on the Adnan Menderes government, with the aim of making Turkey active in Cyprus. For the British, the attempt had a twofold objective. The EOKA campaign would be silenced as quickly as possible, and Turkish Cypriots would not side with Greek Cypriots against the British colonial claims over the island, which would thus remain under the British.Anthony Eden, 2005. Memoirs, Full Circle, Cassell, London 1960, p.400. The Turkish Cypriot leadership visited Menderes to discuss the Cyprus issue. When asked how the Turkish Cypriots should respond to the Greek Cypriot claim of enosis, Menderes replied: \\"You should go to the British foreign minister and request the status quo be prolonged, Cyprus to remain as a British colony\\". When the Turkish Cypriots visited the British foreign secretary and requested for Cyprus to remain a colony, he replied: \\"You should not be asking for colonialism at this day and age, you should be asking for Cyprus be returned to Turkey, its former owner\\".Arif Hasan Tahsin. \\"He Anodos Tou _Denktas Sten Koryphe\\". January, 2001. page 38 As Turkish Cypriots began to look to Turkey for protection, Greek Cypriots soon understood that enosis was extremely unlikely. The Greek Cypriot leader, Archbishop Makarios III, now set independence for the island as his objective.David Hannay, 2005. Cyprus the search for a solution. I.B Tauris, p.2 Britain resolved to solve the dispute by creating an independent Cyprus. In 1959, all involved parties signed the Zurich Agreements: Britain, Turkey, Greece, and the Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders, Makarios and Dr. Fazil Kucuk, respectively. The new constitution drew heavily on the ethnic composition of the island. The President would be a Greek Cypriot, and the Vice-President a Turkish Cypriot with an equal veto. The contribution to the public service would be set at a ratio of 70:30, and the Supreme Court would consist of an equal number of judges from both communities as well as an independent judge who was not Greek, Turkish or British. The Zurich Agreements were supplemented by a number of treaties. The Treaty of Guarantee stated that secession or union with any state was forbidden, and that Greece, Turkey and Britain would be given guarantor status to intervene if that was violated. The Treaty of Alliance allowed for two small Greek and Turkish military contingents to be stationed on the island, and the Treaty of Establishment gave Britain sovereignty over two bases in Akrotiri and Dhekelia. On August 15, 1960, the Republic of Cyprus was proclaimed. The new constitution brought dissatisfaction to Greek Cypriots, who felt it to be highly unjust for them for historical, demographic and contributional reasons. Although 80% of the island were Greek Cypriots and the indigenous people had lived thousands of years and paid 94% of taxes, the new constitution was giving the 17% of Turkish Cypriots, who paid 6% of taxes but got 30% of government jobs and 40% of national security jobs.  Crisis of 1963–1964 =Proposed constitutional amendments and the Akritas plan Within three years tensions between the two communities in administrative affairs began to show. In particular disputes over separate municipalities and taxation created a deadlock in government. A constitutional court ruled in 1963 Makarios had failed to uphold article 173 of the constitution which called for the establishment of separate municipalities for Turkish Cypriots. Makarios subsequently declared his intention to ignore the judgement, resulting in the West German judge resigning from his position. Makarios proposed thirteen amendments to the constitution, which would have had the effect of resolving most of the issues in the Greek Cypriot favour.The Cyprus Conflict , The Main Narrative, by Keith Kyle Under the proposals, the President and Vice-President would lose their veto, the separate municipalities as sought after by the Turkish Cypriots would be abandoned, the need for separate majorities by both communities in passing legislation would be discarded and the civil service contribution would be set at actual population ratios (82:18) instead of the slightly higher figure for Turkish Cypriots. The intention behind the amendments has long been called into question. The Akritas plan, written in the height of the constitutional dispute by the Greek Cypriot interior minister Polycarpos Georkadjis, called for the removal of undesirable elements of the constitution so as to allow power-sharing to work. The plan envisaged a swift retaliatory attack on Turkish Cypriot strongholds should Turkish Cypriots resort to violence to resist the measures, stating “In the event of a planned or staged Turkish attack, it is imperative to overcome it by force in the shortest possible time, because if we succeed in gaining command of the situation (in one or two days), no outside, intervention would be either justified or possible.”The Cyprus Conflict, The Akritas Plan Whether Makarios's proposals were part of the Akritas plan is unclear, however it remains that sentiment towards enosis had not completely disappeared with independence. Makarios described independence as \\"a step on the road to enosis\\".David Hannay, 2005. Cyprus the search for a solution. I.B Tauris, p.3 Preparations for conflict were not entirely absent from Turkish Cypriots either, with right wing elements still believing taksim (partition) the best safeguard against enosis. Greek Cypriots however believe the amendments were a necessity stemming from a perceived attempt by Turkish Cypriots to frustrate the working of government. Turkish Cypriots saw it as a means to reduce their status within the state from one of co-founder to that of minority, seeing it as a first step towards enosis. The security situation deteriorated rapidly. Intercommunal violence An armed conflict was triggered after December 21, 1963, a period remembered by Turkish Cypriots as Bloody Christmas, when a Greek Cypriot policemen that had been called to help deal with a taxi driver refusing officers already on the scene access to check the identification documents of his customers, took out his gun upon arrival and shot and killed the taxi driver and his partner. Eric Solsten summarised the events as follows: \\"a Greek Cypriot police patrol, ostensibly checking identification documents, stopped a Turkish Cypriot couple on the edge of the Turkish quarter. A hostile crowd gathered, shots were fired, and two Turkish Cypriots were killed.\\"Eric Solsten, Country Studies, US Library of Congress, retrieved on 25 May 2012. In the morning after the shooting, crowds gathered in protest in Northern Nicosia, likely encouraged by the TMT, without incident. On the evening of the 22nd, gunfire broke out, communication lines to the Turkish neighbourhoods were cut, and the Greek Cypriot police occupied the nearby airport. On the 23rd, a ceasefire was negotiated, but did not hold. Fighting, including automatic weapons fire, between Greek and Turkish Cypriots and militias increased in Nicosia and Larnaca. A force of Greek Cypriot irregulars led by Nikos Sampson entered the Nicosia suburb of Omorphita and engaged in heavy firing on armed, as well as by some accounts unarmed, Turkish Cypriots. The Omorphita clash has been described by Turkish Cypriots as a massacre, while this view has generally not been acknowledged by Greek Cypriots. Further ceasefires were arranged between the two sides, but also failed. By Christmas Eve, the 24th, Britain, Greece, and Turkey had joined talks, with all sides calling for a truce. On Christmas day, Turkish fighter jets overflew Nicosia in a show of support. Finally it was agreed to allow a force of 2,700 British soldiers to help enforce a ceasefire. In the next days, a \\"buffer zone\\" was created in Nicosia, and a British officer marked a line on a map with green ink, separating the two sides of the city, which was the beginning of the \\"Green Line\\". Fighting continued across the island for the next several weeks. In total 364 Turkish Cypriots and 174 Greek Cypriots were killed during the violence. 25,000 Turkish Cypriots from 103-109 villages fled and were displaced into enclaves and thousands of Turkish Cypriot houses were ransacked or completely destroyed.Report S/5950 (10 September 1964), page 48, paragraph 180 Contemporary newspapers also reported on the forceful exodus of the Turkish Cypriots from their homes. According to The Times in 1964, threats, shootings and attempts of arson were committed against the Turkish Cypriots to force them out of their homes.The Times 04.01.1964 The Daily Express wrote that \\"25,000 Turks have already been forced to leave their homes\\".Daily Express 28.12.1963 The Guardian reported a massacre of Turks at Limassol on 16 February 1964. Turkey had by now readied its fleet and its fighter jets appeared over Nicosia. Turkey was dissuaded from direct involvement by the creation of a United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) in 1964. Despite the negotiated ceasefire in Nicosia, attacks on the Turkish Cypriot persisted, particularly in Limassol. Concerned about the possibility of a Turkish invasion, Makarios undertook the creation of a Greek Cypriot conscript-based army called the “National Guard”. A general from Greece took charge of the army, whilst a further 20,000 well-equipped officers and men were smuggled from Greece into Cyprus. Turkey threatened to intervene once more, but was prevented by a strongly worded letter from the American President Lyndon B. Johnson, anxious to avoid a conflict between NATO allies Greece and Turkey at the height of the Cold War. Turkish Cypriots had by now established an important bridgehead at Kokkina, provided with arms, volunteers and materials from Turkey and abroad. Seeing this incursion of foreign weapons and troops as a major threat, the Cypriot government invited George Grivas to return from Greece as commander of the Greek troops on the island and launch a major attack on the bridgehead. Turkey retaliated by dispatching its fighter jets to bomb Greek positions, causing Makarios to threaten an attack on every Turkish Cypriot village on the island if the bombings did not cease. BBC On This Day. 1964: Guns fall silent in Cyprus The conflict had now drawn in Greece and Turkey, with both countries amassing troops on their Thracian borders. Efforts at mediation by Dean Acheson, a former U.S. Secretary of State, and UN-appointed mediator Galo Plaza had failed, all the while the division of the two communities becoming more apparent. Greek Cypriot forces were estimated at some 30,000, including the National Guard and the large contingent from Greece. Defending the Turkish Cypriot enclaves was a force of approximately 5,000 irregulars, led by a Turkish colonel, but lacking the equipment and organisation of the Greek forces. The Secretary-General of the United Nations in 1964, U Thant, reported the damage during the conflicts: :UNFICYP carried out a detailed survey of all damage to properties throughout the island during the disturbances; it shows that in 109 villages, most of them Turkish-Cypriot or mixed villages, 527 houses have been destroyed while 2,000 others have suffered damage from looting.Report S/5950 (10 September 1964), page 48, paragraph 180  Crisis of 1967  The situation worsened in 1967, when a military junta overthrew the democratically elected government of Greece, and began applying pressure on Makarios to achieve enosis. Makarios, not wishing to become part of a military dictatorship or trigger a Turkish invasion, began to distance himself from the goal of enosis. This caused tensions with the junta in Greece as well as George Grivas in Cyprus. Grivas's control over the National Guard and Greek contingent was seen as a threat to Makarios's position, who now feared a possible coup. Grivas escalated the conflict when his armed units began patrolling the Turkish Cypriot enclaves of Ayios Theodhoros and Kophinou, and on November 15 engaged in heavy fighting with the Turkish Cypriots. By the time of his withdrawal 26 Turkish Cypriots had been killed.Country Studies: Cyprus - Intercommunal Violence Turkey replied with an ultimatum demanding that Grivas be removed from the island, that the troops smuggled from Greece in excess of the limits of the Treaty of Alliance be removed, and that the economic blockades on the Turkish Cypriot enclaves be lifted. Grivas resigned his position and 12,000 Greek troops were withdrawn. Makarios now attempted to consolidate his position by reducing the number of National Guard troops, and by creating a paramilitary force loyal to Cypriot independence. In 1968, acknowledging that enosis was now all but impossible, Makarios stated, \\"A solution by necessity must be sought within the limits of what is feasible which does not always coincide with the limits of what is desirable.\\" Greek coup After 1967 tensions between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots subsided. Instead, the main source of tension on the island came from factions within the Greek Cypriot community. Although Makarios had effectively abandoned enosis in favour of an ‘attainable solution’, many others continued to believe that the only legitimate political aspiration for Greek Cypriots was union with Greece. Makarios was branded a traitor to the cause by Grivas and, in 1971, he made a clandestine return to the island. On his arrival, Grivas began by establishing a nationalist paramilitary group known as the National Organization of Cypriot Fighters (Ethniki Organosis Kyprion Agoniston B or EOKA-B), drawing comparisons with the EOKA struggle for enosis under the British colonial administration of the 1950s. The military junta in Athens saw Makarios as an obstacle, and directed funds to Grivas to carry out a number of attacks and to fund a propaganda campaign through the creation of pro-enosis newspapers. Makarios's failure to disband the National Guard, whose officer class was dominated by mainland Greeks, had meant the junta had practical control over the Cypriot military establishment, leaving Makarios isolated and a vulnerable target.

The monarchy was officially abolished on 28 May 2008. Until the abolition of the monarchy he was known in Nepal by the title Nava Yuvaraj. Nava Yuvaraj Prince Hridayendra was born at 12:49 pm in the Narayanhity Royal Palace in Kathmandu to Paras Bir Bikram Shah Dev, Crown Prince of Nepal and Crown Princess Himani Rajya Lakshmi Devi Shah. At birth he weighed 3.3 kg. His grandfather Gyanendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev is the deposed king of Nepal and his grandmother is Queen Komal Rajya Lakshmi Devi Shah, a member of the Rana dynasty. Through his mother he is descended from the Indian princely family of Sikar, which belongs to the Shekhawat clan. Following Hindu custom he was officially named Hridayendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev in a ceremony at the Narayanhity Royal Palace eleven days after his birth. At birth he was given the title Nava Yuvaraj (Young Crown Prince) being the eldest son of the heir apparent. In Hinduism there are a number of stages to groom a future king. Hridayendra received the traditional rice feeding ceremony (Annaprasan ceremony) at the Narayanhity Royal Palace six months after his birth. The ceremony was carried out in accordance with Vedic tradition. He was fed rice by his mother, and then by other members of the Royal Family, during the ceremony. He was offered a gold coin by Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand and other officials following another traditional feature of the ceremony . Later, Hridayendra made his first public appearance in a chariot procession and was taken to holy sites in old Kathmandu, where worship and rituals were conducted. The prime minister acted as his guardian during this stage of the ceremony, and carried the prince around the temples to symbolise the bond between the people and the monarchy. Place in line of succession Hridayendra was second in the line of succession to the Nepalese throne line of succession to the Nepali throne. In August 2006, before the monarchy was suspended, the Nepalese government adopted a bill to replace the Agnatic succession law with equal primogeniture. The House of Representatives subsequently approved the bill. Had the bill become law, Prince Hridayendra wouldn't have been relegated to third in the line of succession, his older sister Princess Purnika being elevated to second, because a clause of the law stipulated that living dynasts would not be deprived of their position or titles, the new provisions going into effect for those born subsequent to the change in succession order. In February 2007, there was speculation in Nepal that Hridayendra's father and grandfather would make way for him to take the throne. In July 2007, the Nepalese Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala repeated calls for the King and Crown Prince to abdicate in favour of Hridayendra though this was rejected by the Maoists. Abolition of monarchy On 24 December 2007 it was announced that Nepal would abolish the monarchy in 2008 after the Constituent Assembly elections. On 28 May 2008 the monarchy was officially abolished, replaced by an interim secular federal republic. Prior to the abolition of the monarchy Hridayendra attended Rupy's International School in Kathmandu with his sisters Princesses Purnika and Kritika. In July 2008 Prince Hridayendra left Nepal with his mother and sisters to move to Singapore to join his father who had been making arrangements for the family to live in the country.

The most popular walk is the -long journey to Ossian's Hall. Wheelchairs are accommodated via a pass-for-all route. There is also a link to a thirty-mile network of footpaths beyond The Hermitage to various parts of Dunkeld. These paths date back to the 18th century. Originally, the popular riverside path purposely deviated away from the river at about a half-mile from the car park. This was to build up the visitors' anticipation for the waterfall (the Black Linn Falls) that is to be found a short distance ahead. Another path, running parallel to the riverside path, is wider, the purpose for which, it is believed, was to accommodate horse and carriages. A stone bridge, dating from 1770, is located nearby. Standing next to it, and appearing to be growing out of it, is a Cedar of Lebanon, which is believed to be the oldest tree at The Hermitage.

It is an allegory about good and evil, the conflict between mankind's creative and destructive urges, the power of love, and the joy to be found in simple pleasures. Dude is an Everyman who loses his innocence and fights to regain it. Background As soon as the musical Hair opened, Ragni began to work on Dude. MacDermot was busy with Two Gentlemen of Verona but finally began to compose the music. In March 1972, their studio cast album, Salome Bey Sings Songs from Dude, was recorded and released on Kilmarnock Records. The music was more influenced by country music than their previous musical, Hair.Information from Allmusic The rehearsal period was plagued with problems: Kevin Geer, the actor who had been cast in the leading role, Dude, was unable to sing the role acceptably and had to be replaced; the script (such as it was) was far from finished; Ragni's requests of the producers were bizarre (for example, 100 butterflies to be released at the beginning of each performance); and the cast threatened to walk out.Bosworth, Patricia. \\"Dude - An $800,000 Disaster. Where Did They Go Wrong?\\", The New York Times - October 22, 1972 Production In The Broadway Theatre, the musicians were divided, with brass and woodwinds against the wall of one side of the playing area and strings at the other. To accommodate the multimedia presentation, the theatre was gutted and reconverted, at a cost of $800,000, into a circus-like arena in the center (a theatre in the round) filled with fake dirt (real dirt had caused dust; wetting it had caused mud), ramps, runways, catwalks, columns, trapezes, trapdoors, bleachers, and various mechanical and electronic gear. Performers moved freely between the round playing area, representing \\"Earth\\", and the audience, seated in flanking \\"valleys and foothills,\\" with \\"mountains and mountain tops\\" beyond and \\"tree tops and trees\\" (mezzanine) above. \\"Heaven and hell\\" were also represented. The overall effect was of a circus being performed in a primeval forest. The previews were disastrous, as the audience could not hear with the orchestra scattered around the edges of the theatre. Despite attempts at amplification, the acoustics were still bad in the hollowed out theatre. The director and choreographer resigned, to be replaced by Tom O'Horgan, who had directed Hair and Jesus Christ Superstar. Previews were shut down, and the show went back into rehearsal. Some cast changes were made, and flamboyant visual effects were added. The director and cast confronted Ragni and forced him to rewrite scenes, including most of the second act. Actors wrote some of their own dialogue. The script finally settled down, mostly, by the second to last preview. After sixteen previews, the Broadway production, directed by Tom O'Horgan, opened on October 9, 1972 at The Broadway Theatre. Universally crucified by the critics (and audiences), who found it incomprehensible, it ran for only 16 performances. The cast included Nell Carter, Rae Allen, Salome Bey, and Ralph Carter, who won the Drama Desk Award for Most Promising Performer. Ralph Carter, an 11-year-old African-American, replaced Kevin Geer, a white 23-year-old, who was originally slated to play \\"Dude\\". Due to Carter's age, Nat Morris was cast as \\"Big Dude\\" in order to still use the more mature songs. Despite leaving the show, Geer's image, with his back facing the camera was used for the show's poster.http://www.orlok.com/hair/holding/photographs/dude/Dudead1.html Only five weeks after Dude closed, MacDermot experienced another major failure with the flop musical Via Galactica. Synopsis Reba and Harold, actors who believe they have been cast in Richard III, instead find themselves portraying Adam and Eve in a Garden of Eden-like setting, where they are tempted by Zero (the devil) and give birth to son Dude. The forces of Good (#33, Bread, Susie Moon, Mother Earth, and the Shubert Angels) and Evil (Zero, Nero, Esso, Extra, and Sissy) try to gain control of Dude's soul. Dude grows up and succumbs to the temptations of bizarre sexual practices and illicit drugs, leaving his parents guilt-ridden, until Guide #33 (God) assures them that life is merely show business and everything has a happy ending.

Much of Fellini's research into the profession of tabloid journalism was simply buying dinner for Secchiaroli and his friends, and listening to their exploits. Ironically, by the time the term 'paparazzi' was coined, Secchiaroli had become more of an insider in the Italian film industry and had left the paparazzi-style attack photography behind. He became well known for informal candid portraits of film stars, both at the studio and at their homes.  Early life  Secchiaroli was born on 26 November 1925, in Centocelle, a suburb of Rome. Centocelle was at that time much farther away culturally from the big city than its ten-kilometer distance would indicate. His father made sure he was employed on his summer breaks, so he would learn useful skills. Secchiaroli was proud of his carpentry and metalworking skills throughout his life. He took his first photographs in 1941, mostly unremarkable, though one shows a possible early manifestation of the news photographer's sense of timing - an image of a friend on a bicycle with a flying soccer ball frozen in time next to his head. After a short time working at Cinecittà, the movie studio that would be so central to his later professional career, he worked as a 'scattino' or itinerant street photographer, doing portraits of tourists.

Based on the success of Republic Pictures's 1936 serial Darkest Africa, starring real-life animal trainer Clyde Beatty, Columbia made this exotic jungle serial starring real-life animal collector Frank \\"Bring 'Em Back Alive\\" Buck. Set in the fictional land of Seemang in Asia, Buck plays the role of Frank Hardy, a soldier of fortune who intervenes in and investigates attempts to run a rubber plantation owner and his daughter off their land. It was directed by Harry L. Fraser and George Melford, and filmed in black and white in California, USA. In 1946 material from this serial was re-edited into the 70-minute feature film adaptation called Jungle Terror. Plot In the Asian province of Seemang, where the Bay of Bengal meets the jungle, Chandler Elliott (John St. Polis) owns a large and prosperous rubber plantation. His attractive daughter, Dorothy (Charlotte Henry), is engaged to neighboring planter Tom Banning (William Bakewell), but troubles are brewing for both plantations. They ship a cargo of rubber on a riverboat to be taken to an ocean port, but the boat is hi-jacked by river pirates. They kill the crew and steal the shipment. This is part of a plot by Jim Murphy (LeRoy Mason), Elliott's plantation manager, and others to force Elliott to sell his plantation. Local explorer Frank Hardy (Frank Buck) determines to find out who is behind the plot. Filming In his autobiography, director Harry L. Fraser described filming the scene in Jungle Menace during which a boa constrictor attacks the heroine Dorothy (Charlotte Henry). The villain has tied Dorothy hand and foot and she thrashes wildly, terrified when she suddenly sees the huge snake: \\"The snake was in no hurry. Slowly he slithered across the girl's body, while she screamed and struggled. He turned, looking for a spot to slip under her to make his first wrap. I motioned to the reptile crew to get ready, and a split-second later gave them the signal to move in. But now, the maddened snake fought them and did its best to coil around one of the men. Before that happened, however, I had cut, and we had a good cliff-hanger with our terror-stricken heroine to close the episode.\\" Harry L. Fraser. I Went That-a-Way. The Scarecrow Press, Inc. (November 1, 1990). P 117 Buck drank heavily on set and was not always sober during filming. Fraser recounts Buck justified it saying “I’d die in the jungle just drinking coffee. I drink martinis, Harry. Keep me going. Now, my problem is where can I get a thermos filled with martinis at six o’clock in the morning?” Critical reception Film critics enjoyed the show: \\"Kids will love Jungle Menace for its harem- scarum adventure and for the presence of Frank Buck, with his Wild Animals Associates, Inc. Frank Buck plays the hero, Frank Hardy, when gangdom invades the rubber business and river pirates grab off plantation cargo.

The Monster That Challenged the Worlds Gramercy Pictures is not related to the former PolyGram division of the same name. Plot In the Salton Sea, an underwater earthquake causes a crevice to open, releasing prehistoric giant mollusks. A rescue training parachute jump is conducted, but the patrol boat sent to pick up the jumper finds only a floating parachute. One sailor dives in but also disappears. The other sailor screams in terror as something rises from the water. When the patrol boat does not answer radio calls, Lt. Cmdr. John \\"Twill\\" Twillinger takes a rescue party out on a second patrol boat to investigate. They find the deserted patrol boat covered in a strange slime; the jumper's body then floats to the surface, now blackened and drained of bodily fluids. Twill takes a sample of the slime to the base lab for analysis, where he teams up with recently widowed Gail MacKenzie and Dr. Jess Rogers. A young couple disappear after going for a swim. U.S. Navy divers investigate and discover a giant egg and the body of one of the victims on the ocean floor. The divers are attacked by a giant mollusk, which kills one of the divers. The mollusk attacks the boat, but Twill stabs it in the eye with a grappling hook. The egg is taken to the U.S. Navy lab for study and kept under temperature control to prevent it from hatching. The mollusks escape into an irrigation canal system, attacking livestock, a lock keeper, a trysting couple, and others. Navy divers locate a group of mollusks in the canal system, and use explosives to destroy them. In the meantime, Gail is at the lab with her young daughter, Sandy. Worried about the lab rabbits being cold in the lab's lowered temperature, Sandy surreptitiously turns up the thermostat. Twill calls the lab and gets no answer. He arrives and finds that the hatched mollusk has Gail and Sandy cornered in a closet, where they ran to escape from the monster. He fights it with lab chemicals and a CO2 fire extinguisher until other Navy personnel arrive and shoot the mollusk.

It became a town at the start of 2007. Daleszyce lies among the hills of the Malopolska Upland, in the historic province of Lesser Poland. The area of the town is 15,50 km2., and due to proximity to Kielce, it is served by buses of Kielce Transit System. Origins of its name are not known, probably Daleszyce was named after its founder, a man named Dalesz or Dalech. First mention of Daleszyce comes from Jan Długosz’s chronicle Annales seu cronici incliti regni Poloniae. Długosz wrote that in 1222, Bishop of Kraków Iwo Odrowąż funded St. Michael church here, which means that the village must have existed before that year. Daleszyce was located near two merchant routes - east-west (from Sandomierz and Opatów to Wieluń and Opole), and south-north (from Wiślica and Nowy Korczyn to Sieradz and Piotrków). In 1241, after the Battle of Chmielnik (see Mongol invasion of Poland), Daleszyce was burned, together with the church. During the reign of King Kazimierz Wielki, Daleszyce, which was property of Bishops of Kraków, remained a village, but it had a parish church, which elevated its status. In 1569, Bishop Filip Padniewski received from King Zygmunt August permission to grant Magdeburg rights to the village of Daleszyce, located in Chęciny County, Sandomierz Voivodeship. The new town was given a coat of arms, and its market square was expanded, with streets stemming from it. The 16th century shape of town’s center has not changed since then. Daleszyce had a town hall and a local government, together with a wójt. Every Tuesday there was a fair, and bishop Padniewski allowed town’s residents to collect timber in nearby woods. Daleszyce was a trade center of local importance, there also were artisans, such as blacksmiths, tailors, butchers and potters. Furthermore, the town had a brick manufacture, two water mills and open pit iron ore mine. Daleszyce prospered until the mid-17th century, when, during the Deluge, Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth was invaded by the Swedish Empire. During the siege of Chęciny, the invaders ransacked and burned Daleszyce, and the town never recovered from the destruction. In the 18th century, Daleszyce remained a poor town, with most houses made of timber, as it was the cheapest building material. After the Partitions of Poland, Daleszyce briefly belonged to the Austrian Empire, and in 1815, it became part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland. In 1820, the town had 232 houses and 1270 inhabitants, and its role as a local trade center was taken over by the quickly developing nearby city of Kielce. Since the mid 19th century, the number of Jews grew, and in 1894, a wooden synagogue was built. Daleszyce officially remained a town, but it looked like a large village. Residents of Daleszyce took active role in January Uprising, forming a local unit under Wawrzyniec Cedro. They camped in a nearby forest, where graves of the 1860s Polish rebels can still be found. In 1865, as a punishment, Tsar Alexander II stripped Daleszyce of its town charter, and imposed a fine on the village. In the Second Polish Republic, Daleszyce remained a poor village, without industry, and located away from railroads. Unemployment was common, and jobs scarce in the overpopulated region. In 1932, street fighting erupted after a police officer killed a local resident. On September 5, 1939, first Wehrmacht units entered Daleszyce, burning 20% of houses. During the Holocaust, almost all Jews were murdered by Germans, and the occupiers executed a number of Poles, including whole families. During World War II, Daleszyce was an important center of Polish resistance. Local Home Army platoon was part of Kielce’s 4th Home Army Legions Infantry Regiment. Its members took an oath at Daleszyce’s market square (August 9, 1944), singing Polish anthem together with residents. After the oath, Home Army units headed towards Warsaw, to help in Warsaw Uprising, but were halted by the Wehrmacht. On August 26, 1944, whole village was burned to the ground by the Germans and their Ukrainian collaborators, while residents ran away to the forests Daleszyce was rebuilt in the late 1940s. It remained a village until January 1, 2007.

She wrote the biographical account Lord Byron's Life in Italy. On 19 January 1818, Teresa married an elderly diplomat, Count Alessandro Guiccioli, who was 50 years older than her. It was three days later, on 22 January, that she met Lord Byron at the home of Countess Albrizzi. Count Guiccioli was a ruthless and opportunistic nobleman who had ingratiated himself with Napoleon during his campaign in Italy in 1796, and during the French rule of Italy during the Napoleonic era, Count Guiccioli held a series of high offices, making him one of the most powerful men in Italy. When France was on the verge of defeat in 1814, Count Guiccioli defected over to the opposing side and came to enjoy power under the Pope, who he had starting out serving before defecting over to Napoleon. A cold, calculating man who had preferred to serve the strong rather than the weak, supporting Napoleon as long as he was winning and switched sides the moment he started losing, Count Guiccioli inspired no love or affection from anyone who knew him. Even Guiccioli's children from his previous marriages denounced their father was a cold, grasping man only interested in money and power. There is no evidence that Teresa, his third wife, ever felt any affection for her husband. Byron's relationship with Teresa was a dangerous one as Count Guiccioli was still a powerful man who was widely believed to have been behind the murder in 1816 of another nobleman who was suing him for having seized his lands under Napoleon. In a letter to her sent on 22 April 1819 written in Italian, Byron wrote \\"you sometimes tell me I have been your first real love-and I assure that you shall be my last Passion\\". In a letter, Byron wrote that she mailed him some of her pubic hair, which was a traditional Italian gesture that indicated her willingness to be his mistress. The Countess Guiccioli lived with Byron as his common-law wife first in Ravenna and then in Genoa until 1823. Her father, Count Ruggiero Gamba was an Italian nationalist who wanted to unify all of the Italian states into one, a project that would also mean the Austrian Empire, which ruled much of what is now northern Italy would also lose much territory. Under Teresa's influence, Byron joined a secret pseudo-Masonic society dedicated to Italian unity and driving out the Austrians that had already been joined by her father and brother.. For plotting against the Austrian Empire, Count Gamba was exiled to the countryside of the Romagna region. In 1823, the Austrian authorities allowed Count Gamba to leave his exile in the Romagna with the condition that the Countess Guiccioli had to end her relationship with Byron and return to her husband. The news that the Countess Guiccoili was leaving him helped precipitate Byron's decision to go fight on the Greek side in the Greek war of independence. When Byron boarded the Hercules, the ship that was to take him from Genoa to Greece, it caused \\"passionate grief\\" from Guiccioli who broke down in tears as she said farewell to her lover. Going along with Byron to Greece was her brother, Pietro Gamba, who was to serve as Byron's bumbling right-hand man. Alexandre Dumas included her as a minor character in his novel The Count of Monte Cristo using the disguised name \\"Countess G-\\". Lord Byron also used this shortened name in his journals. At a party in Paris hosted by Napoleon III in the 1860s, the wife of the American ambassador introduced a wealthy American tourist, Mrs. Mary R. Darby, to the now elderly Contessa Guiccioli, saying she was one of the last people alive who knew Byron personally. Mrs. Darby introduced herself by saying that she had heard Byron was \\"king of poets\\", only for Guiccioli who was still in love with him to say that Byron was the \\"king of men\\". Mrs. Darby befriended Guiccioli who showed her two manuscripts that she had written in French, recalling her youth with Byron. Mrs. Darby, who quickly became Guiccioli's best friend, worked with her on turning the manuscripts into books, only one of which has survived. When the Contessa Guiccioli died in 1873 with no children, her papers were inherited by her grand-nephew, Count Carlo Gamba, who hid them away in his family's archives, believing that his grand-aunt's scandalous relationship with Byron would damage the reputation of the Gamba family. Not until 2005 were one of the books the Contessa Guiccioli wrote about her relationship with Byron published.

It is synonymous with the subphylum Calcichordata. Their unusual appearances have led to a variety of very different reconstructions of their anatomy, how they lived, and their relationships to other organisms. Stylophorans have played a major role in debates over the origin of chordates, as under the calcichordate hypothesis they were interpreted as being stem-group chordates. However, multiple lines of evidence argue against the calcichordate hypothesis, and stylophorans are now widely agreed to belong to the echinoderm total group. Debate remains over whether they are stem-group echinoderms which predate the origin of radial symmetry, or highly modified descendants of radially symmetric echinoderms. Description The general stylophoran body plan consists of a flattened theca and a single jointed appendage which extends from it. Stylophoran tests are composed of stereom calcite plates, which has traditionally been the basis for assigning them to Echinodermata. However, they also lack the radial symmetry characteristic of most other echinoderms, with the earlier members of the group being flattened and asymmetrical, and the later ones closer to bilateral symmetry. In Mitrocystites and perhaps in other forms the appendage does not end in an attachment organ, and may have served the organism for movement. Cothurnocystis is asymmetrical and boot-shaped, and Mitrocystites is bilaterally symmetrical and more streamlined. There were three major hypotheses about the anatomy and systematics of stylophorans. The earliest idea, proposed by Ubaugh was that the group was aberrant echnoderms with a single starfish-like feeding arm. In the calcichordate hypothesis proposed by Richard Jeffries, it was suggested that some or all stylophorans might have had gill slits like chordates, and the appendage was a tail that contained a notochord. This reconstruction lead to the hypothesis that some or all of the stylophorans may have been ancestral to the chordate branch of the deuterostomes, rather than being within the echinoderms. An alternative hypothesis (proposed by D.G. Shu, Simon Conway Morris, and others) suggested that stylophorans were ecologically stalked echinoderms. The appendage was reconstructed as a stalk to attach the animal to the sea floor, but the hypothesis proposed the group was close to the ancestor of both echinoderms and hemichordates, and the stalk contained a notochord-like element or neural tube. Both hypotheses of chordate relationships were later disproven by the discovery of fossil soft tissues in a study published in 2019. Life reconstruction of Cothurnocystis Scanning electron microscopy of preserved soft tissues in the single appendage of two genera of stylophorans showed the appendage contained an ambulacral canal with tube feet covered by mobile plates, and was not a tail or stalk with fixed plates covering a notochord or neural tube. The appendage is therefore interpreted as a starfish-like feeding arm. The enlarged base of the arm contains an extension of the body cavity rather than muscle blocks to move a tail; the structure at the base of the arm is most parsimoniously reconstructed as the mouth. Stylophorans are therefore reconstructed as true echinoderms of uncertain affiliations, without radial symmetry but with stereom and a water vascular system. The body was oriented with the arm as the anterior end of the animal, which lay on the substrate; food would have been captured by tube feet and moved down the arm to the mouth. Some genera may have also used the water vascular system for locomotion. Rather than swimming with a muscular post-anal tail as in chordates, mobile genera would have crawled \\"arm-first\\" using a water vascular system, like starfish and sea cucumbers. Classification There are over 120 known species of stylophoran. Stylophora is conventionally divided into two orders, Cornuta and Mitrata. Mitrates may have evolved from cornutes, which would render the cornutes paraphyletic. An alternate taxonomy regards the mitrates and mitrate-like cornutes as forming the order Ankyroida, while maintaining the order Cornuta for the less mitrate-like cornutes. The most basal known stylophoran is Ceratocystis.

In 2014, Thomas organized a 25-city \\"non-fiction\\" theatrical tour to launch his book and to promote the documentary film Alive Inside. He is the founder of The Eden Alternative, a philosophy and program that de- institutionalized nursing homes in all 50 states and worldwide over the past 20 years. A self-described “Nursing Home Abolitionist,” he is also creator of Green House Project, a long term care approach where nursing homes are torn down and replaced with small, home-like environments. In 2005, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation announced a five-year $10 million grant that would result in the creation of Green House projects in all fifty states. As a professor at The Erickson School at UMBC, Thomas led development of the nation's first emergency department designed for older adults. Life Born in Tioga County, Thomas wrote of his childhood in Nichols, New York, \\"I was surrounded by older relatives since the day I was born and thought of my grandmother's house as an extension, for a lack of a better word, of my own. I think that the most important thing I learned was that older relatives were valuable and esteemed members of the extended family. In fact, they were the glue that held the family together.\\" In 2008, the Wall Street Journal named Thomas' among the 12 most influential Americans shaping aging in the 21st century. U.S. News & World Report described Thomas as a revolutionary, \\"With his startling common- sense ideas and his ability to persuade others to take a risk, this creative and wildly exuberant 46-year-old country doctor has become something of a culture changer—reimagining how Americans will approach aging in the 21st century. And with 35 million Americans over 65—a number that will double by 2030--that takes a big imagination indeed.\\" In 2014, Thomas organized a \\"non- fiction theater\\" roadshow bus tour to 25 cities nationwide featuring spoken word, film, art and live music performances. Sponsored by AARP's Life Reimagined, the tour targeted members of the baby boom generation and offered new approaches to growth, aging, health and wellness based on Thomas' non- fiction book Second Wind: Navigating the Passage to a Slower, Deeper and More Connected Life. Performers included Thomas, TV personality Dr. Janet Taylor and Musicians for World Harmony founder Samite Mulondo. The tour featured an exclusive director's cut of the 2014 Sundance Audience Choice documentary film Alive Inside. From 1991 to 2007, Thomas operated a small farm in Sherburne, New York, where he built a house powered entirely by wind and solar energy. He now resides in Ithaca, New York, with his wife, Judith Meyers-Thomas, three sons, and one daughter. Thomas and his wife had two daughters who were born with a rare and catastrophic neurologic condition known as \\"Ohtahara Syndrome.\\" Sadly, their daughter Hannah, passed away on March 27, 2015 just shy of her 18th birthday. Medicine Thomas attended the State University College at Cortland, where he earned a B.S. in Biology, summa cum laude, in 1982. While in college, he ran successfully for the presidency of the college's Student Association and unsuccessfully for mayor of the city of Cortland. Thomas graduated from Harvard Medical School (1986), where he was a founding editor of Murmurs, a quarterly journal of opinion. Thomas went on to graduate medical training in the Highland Hospital/University of Rochester Family Medicine Residency, where he was selected by the Mead Johnson Foundation as one of the top Family Medicine residents in the country. Though he planned on a career in emergency medicine, a part-time position as the medical director of a small rural nursing home in New Berlin, New York, turned into a full-time and lifelong passion for improving the well being of older people. Thomas added a Certificate in Geriatrics in 1994 and opened a geriatric medical practice that grew to become a multi-physician group. Although he left full-time medical practice in 2004, he continues to lecture at the SUNY Health Science Center’s Clinical Campus in Binghamton. In 2007, he was appointed as Professor of Aging Studies and Distinguished Fellow at UMBC’s Erickson School in Baltimore, MD. Long-term care reform Thomas and his wife developed the Eden Alternative in the early 1990s as a philosophy to deinstitutionalize long term care facilities by alleviating the \\"three plagues\\" of boredom, helplessness, and loneliness. The Eden Alternative put forward a critique of the status quo in long-term care and offered a creative way to “change the culture” of nursing homes by bringing growth and laughter into the lives of elders. The philosophy called for fundamental changes in the relationship between staff and management and introduced pets, gardens and children to nursing homes. Thomas founded the Eden Alternative non-profit organization in 1994, which has grown to include affiliates in Japan, Australia, Scandinavia, Europe, Canada and the United Kingdom as well as the fifty states. Dr. Thomas continues to serve as its president. In spreading the Eden Alternative philosophy nationwide, Thomas said he saw that America’s nursing home buildings were “aging faster than the people living inside them.” This led him to imagine a new approach to long-term that became known as the Green House. Supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Dr. Thomas oversaw the construction of the nation’s first Green Houses. In 2005, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation announced a five-year ten million dollar grant to support the launch of Green House projects in all fifty states. In November, 2008, Senate Finance Committee Chair Max Baucus (D-MT) said the Green House model \\"has shown promise for both improving the quality of life and care in these settings,\\" and should be piloted.ProviderMagazine.com in May 2010 called The Green House Project the \\"pinnacle\\" of culture change in long term care.Provider Magazine In 2008, Thomas led a team of experts from the Erickson School of Aging Studies at UMBC to create the nation's first elder- friendly emergency department at Holy Cross Hospital in Silver Spring, Maryland. The separate ER was scientifically designed to reduce anxiety, confusion and the risk of falling. Thomas received the 12th Annual Heinz Award for the Human Condition in 2006 for his contributions to long term care: \\"With contagious enthusiasm and an unwavering vision, Dr. William Thomas has helped bring dignity, joy and love into an environment that has been too long lacking in these essential human qualities. As America continues to age, his transformation of our system of long-term care provides a timely prescription for the care of generations to come.\\" Books His published books include:  Awards *AARP Visiting Scholar *Ashoka North American Fellow *Chief Wellness Officer, Holiday Retirement *America’s Award *12th Heinz Award for the Human Condition *One of America’s Best Leaders (Kennedy School Government) *AAHSA Distinguished Service Award *AHCA Public Service Award *Giraffe Award ReferencesExternal links * https://drbillthomas.org * https://changingaging.org * https://myminka.com * https://www.edenalt.org * https://www.thegreenhouseproject.org Living people American geriatricians University of Maryland, Baltimore County faculty Harvard Medical School alumni 1959 births Place of birth missing (living people) ","title":"William H.

In his mid-forties he relocated to Cuckoo Hill, near Fordingbridge in Hampshire, England, and spent the rest of his life investigating and recording the archaeology, geology and folklore of the New Forest and Cranborne Chase regions. Personal life and family Sumner was born in 1853 at Old Alresford, Hampshire, the son of Reverend George Henry Sumner, an Anglican clergyman, and Mary Elizabeth Sumner (née Heywood), also prominent in the Church of England and well known as the founder of the Mothers' Union. After attending Eton, Sumner studied at Christ Church, Oxford, and in 1881 qualified as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn, London. In 1883 Sumner married Agnes Benson, the sister of his college friend W A S Benson. Together they had five children – three boys and two girls. In 1897 Sumner retired from London and moved his family to Bournemouth on the south coast of England, ostensibly because of his wife's ill-health. In 1902 he acquired a plot of land at Cuckoo Hill near South Gorley, on the east side of the Avon valley, and designed and built his ideal family house. Sumner lived at Cuckoo Hill from 1904 until his death in 1940 at the age of 87. The house has since been renamed \\"Heywood Sumner House\\", and is currently run as a care home. Art The Studio, April 1898. Sumner studied law at Oxford and London alongside his childhood friend W A S Benson, who later became a successful metalwork designer; it was through this friendship that he was introduced to William Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement. Sumner rejected the elitism of the William Morris clique and engaged in projects to bring Arts and Crafts within the experience of the general public. In particular in the 1890s he helped to set up the Fitzroy Picture Society, a group of artists dedicated to producing boldly coloured prints that could be sold cheaply to liven up the walls of public institutions such as schools and hospitals. Sumner did not excel in any one particular technique, but his breadth of achievement was remarkable. Several of his areas of expertise are described below. Line drawing and etching Sumner's earliest publications – The Itchen Valley from Tichbourne to Southampton (1881) and The Avon from Naseby to Tewkesbury (1882) – were illustrated with his own etchings, and in 1883 he was commissioned to illustrate an edition of John R. Wise's The New Forest. In the process of illustrating various children's books he developed a more stylised technique, used to good effect in his later publications on the topography and archaeology of the New Forest and surroundings. Sgraffito Sumner experimented with sgraffito, a technique of incising designs in coloured plaster. He started by decorating the houses of his relatives, and later his narrative designs and ornamental patterns covered the walls of several Victorian churches and chapels in the British Isles: from the Church of St Mary the Virgin, Llanfair Kilgeddin(1887–88) to All Saints in Ennismore Gardens, London (1897–1903). There are very fine examples of his work and stained glass at Christ Church, Crookham, Hampshire. Stained glass Sumner designed stained-glass windows for several churches built or redecorated around 1900, sometimes as part of a bigger scheme including his sgraffito and mosaic. Examples of his stained glass work can be found at St Mary (Longworth, Berkshire), All Saints (Ennismore Gardens, London – now a Russian Orthodox cathedral), St Mary the Virgin (Llanfair Kilgeddin, Wales), St Mary Magdalene (North Ockendon, Essex), St Peter (Oakford, Devon) and the rose window at St Mary the Virgin (Great Warley, Essex). Tapestry One of Sumner's last commercial works was a tapestry called The Chace, woven by William Morris and company in 1908. Naturalism and the Countryside=The Book of Gorley In 1910 Sumner published The Book of Gorley, a work that had started out as a personal journal of his new rural way of life. In addition to lyrical descriptions of the topography and natural history of his surroundings, the book includes anecdotes and illustrations of local characters and the history of the New Forest and its adjacent commons. The earliest version of The Book of Gorley was re-published in 1987 as a full- colour, original manuscript edition with the title Cuckoo Hill: The Book of Gorley. The book is illustrated throughout with Sumner's distinctive line drawings, stylised maps and watercolour paintings. Folk songs Sumner illustrated and published his own collection of eleven Hampshire folk songs, entitled The Besom-Maker and other Country-Folk Songs. He sometimes entertained his fellow members at the Art Worker's Guild with renditions of these songs and in return they called him 'The Shepherd'. Archaeology Example of Sumner's illustration style. Sumner's earliest contributions to archaeology involved surveying the prehistoric earthworks of Cranborne Chase, only a bike-ride away from his home at Cuckoo Hill in the Avon valley. The results of his fieldwork between 1911 and 1913 were published in a collection entitled The Ancient Earthworks of Cranborne Chase. In 1917 he published a companion volume The Ancient Earthworks of the New Forest. In 1921, in partnership with W G Wallace, Sumner published Ancient Earthworks of the Bournemouth District in the proceedings of the Bournemouth Natural Science Society. These three studies of ancient earthworks in the Wessex region included hillforts, enclosures and notable barrows. Sumner's distinctive graphic style was evident in the maps, diagrams and illustrations of these earthworks.

Biography Born in a family of a priest, he was the youngest of six brothers. He was home schooled until the age 10, and then sent to Lazarian College in Moscow. Upon his graduation in 1862 he was asked to stay and teach modern and Classical Armenian at the primary school level, all the while he was preparing for a university degree. In 1867 he was granted a degree in oriental languages by the University of St. Petersburg. He obtained a college level teaching position at Lazarian College and retained it for thirty five years, until his retirement in 1897. He started writing in his student days and was influenced by Raphael Patkanian and Khachatur Abovyan. He contributed to the journal Hiusisapayl (Northern Lights), which was founded and edited by Stepanos Nazarian. His articles and essays received public interest and he remained a contributor until the papers demise. In 1860 he published his first collection of poems, titled Azatutyan zhamer (Hours of freedom) comprising thirty three poems, most of which were written in modern Armenian and few in classical. The theme of the poems varied between love, nature, and national heroes. His second book was published in 1865: it was a long patriotic poem titled Levoni vishte (Levon's grief). The poem is about Levon, a serious-minded, idealistic Armenian youth studying in the far north. He is deeply concerned and grieved by the dire conditions of his homeland, while his compatriots carry on in prodigal life, some even deny their Armenian identities. Lonely and grieved he decides to return home and contribute to the struggle against ignorance, servility, moral and religious decline, and corrupt leadership in all domains. The poem which reflected the reformist ideology emerging in Russian Empire at the time, was very well received. Articles, essays, and speeches about the national and social issues of the time make a considerable part of Shahaziz's legacy. He encouraged the use of the modern Armenian language, criticized methods of archaic education and conservatism of religious leaders, and denounced despotism and the hypocritical attitude of European powers with regards to the Armenian question. In 1893 he founded the Abovian-Nazarian Fund for writers in financial need. After his retirement in 1898 he created a committee in Moscow to organize the care and education of children orphaned because of the Hamidian massacres. He exposed the anti-Armenian stance of czarist Russia regime in Hishogutiuner Vardanants toni artiv (Recollections from the feast of Vardanank, 1901) and duplicity of Turkish diplomacy in Mi kani khosk im entertsoghnerin (A few words to my readers, 1903).

It is about two twelve-year-old girls who try to get a school story published. Plot summary As the novel begins, twelve-year-old Natalie is almost done writing a novel called The Cheater about a girl and her friends. It is uncommon, if not impossible, for someone her age to get published, but Natalie's best friend, Zoe Reisman, thinks The Cheater is good enough. Natalie wants her mother, Hannah Nelson, who works as an editor at Shipley Junior Books, to edit her manuscript, but she doesn't want her mother to find out that she wrote it. To accomplish this, Natalie uses the pseudonym Cassandra Day, and Zoe acts as her literary agent, fabricating the \\"Sherry Clutch Literary Agency\\". Zoe hides her identity by using her nickname, \\"Zee Zee\\", and pronouncing her last name differently. The girls decide to rent a cheap \\"instant office\\", then realize that they could use some adult help. They enlist a teacher at their school, Laura Clayton, to be their adviser, and together the three form \\"The Publishing Club\\". Zoe gives Ms. Clayton $500 to pay for the office and services, but feeling guilty, Ms. Clayton secretly pays for it herself and safely stores Zoe's money away in her bank account. Besides the girls' age disadvantage, the editor in chief at Shipley, \\"Lethal\\" Letha Springfield, adds complications. Seeing that The Cheater could prove to be a success, Letha takes over editing the manuscript. Zoe (speaking as Zee Zee) gets into an argument with her and states that Cassandra (Natalie) will only write with Hannah as her editor. Instead of obliging, Letha refuses and declares that the book will not be published by Shipley unless an apology is received. This problem is averted when Zoe sends a copy of the manuscript directly to Tom Morton, president of Shipley, along with a letter describing Cassandra's wishes. After reading (and loving) the story, Tom tells Letha to let Hannah handle it. Later, when the girls are offered a contract, they show it to Zoe's father, who is a lawyer, and they get Natalie's Uncle Fred to sign in place of her mother. After hearing the story from the girls, Zoe's father is extremely impressed with Ms. Clayton and calls to commend her. He also gets her to send him a bill for the office.

She is the fifth and youngest daughter of Emperor Shōwa and Empress Kōjun, and the youngest sister of the Emperor Emeritus of Japan, Akihito. She married Hisanaga Shimazu on 3 March 1960. As a result, she gave up her imperial title and left the Japanese Imperial Family, as required by law. Biography Prince Masahito and Princess Takako in 1952 Princess Takako was born at the Tokyo Imperial Palace. Her childhood appellation was . As with her elder sisters, she was not raised by her biological parents, but by a succession of court ladies at a separate palace built for her and her sisters in the Marunouchi district of Tokyo. She graduated from the Gakushuin Peers School, and was also tutored along with her siblings in English language by an American tutor, Elizabeth Grey Vining during the American occupation of Japan following World War II. Princess Takako graduated from Gakushuin University Women's College with a degree in English literature in March 1957. On 10 March 1960, Princess Takako wed Hisanaga Shimazu (born 29 March 1934, Tokyo), the son of the late Count Hisanori Shimazu and (at the time) an analyst at the Japan Export-Import Bank (JEXIM). The couple were introduced by common acquaintances at the Gakushuin. They shared a common interest in the music of Perez Prado. Upon her marriage, the Princess relinquished her membership in the Imperial Family and adopted her husband's surname, in accordance with the 1947 Imperial Household Law. Described by Western media sources at the time as a \\"commoner bank clerk,\\" the groom was actually a grandson of the last daimyō of Satsuma Domain, Shimazu Tadayoshi, and thus a maternal first cousin to Empress Kōjun, making the bride and groom first cousins once removed. Takako and her husband had one son, Yoshihisa Shimazu, who was born on 5 April 1962. In 1963, three years after her marriage, she narrowly escaped from an attempted kidnapping. Due to extensive media coverage, the location of the couple's home was common knowledge, as was her $500,000 marriage dowry (in Japan, the bride is given a sum of money for her marriage). A member of the criminal group tipped off the police before the kidnapping could occur. Hisanaga Shimazu pursued a thirty- year career with JEXIM, including postings to Washington D.C. in the United States and Sydney, Australia accompanied by his wife. He became a member of the Board of Directors of the Sony Corporation upon his retirement from the bank in 1987, served as executive director of the Sony Foundation for Science Education from 1994 to 2001, and is currently research director of the Yamashina Institute for Ornithology. The former Princess has made numerous appearances on Japanese television as a commentator on world events, and is also on the Board of Directors of the Prince Hotels chain.

He was a pioneer in the field of avalanche research and forecasting in North America. Background LaChapelle was born and raised in Tacoma, Washington. Following high school at Stadium High School, he served in the Navy from 1944 to 1946, and then attended the University of Puget Sound, graduating in 1949 with degrees in physics and math. He then studied at the Swiss Federal Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research in Davos, Switzerland from 1950 to 1951, and returned to the US to work as a snow ranger for the Forest Service in Alta, Utah starting in 1952. Montgomery Atwater, who had established the first avalanche research center in the Western Hemisphere at Alta over the preceding 7 years, said of his new hire: \\"To describe Ed LaChapelle is to write the specifications for an avalanche researcher: graduate physicist, glaciologist with a year's study at the Avalanche Institute, skilled craftsman in the shop, expert ski mountaineer. He even looked like a scientist, tall and slender with a slight stoop and that remote look in his eye which means peering into one's own mind.\\"Atwater (1968), p. 114. LaChapelle worked at Alta for the next two decades, eventually becoming head of the avalanche center. He married Mary Dolores Greenwell and they had a son Randy (later changed his name to David) whom they homeschooled and offered a life filled with skiing, art, high mountain adventures and a crucial blend of Ed's scientific, mechanically oriented and inventive mind and Dolores' care for the earth and what the field of her work would later call Deep Ecology. They would travel with the seasons following Ed's professional work and so they shared their time between three homes: Alta in the winter, Blue Glacier in the summer and Kirkland the rest of the year. From 1967 to 1982, LaChapelle was professor of atmospheric sciences and geophysics at the University of Washington, and then professor emeritus following his retirement until his death. From 1973 to 1977, he was involved in avalanche studies at the Institute for Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR) of the University of Colorado at Boulder. In 1968, he was involved in the development of the avalanche transceiver, which has since become a standard piece of safety equipment for backcountry skiing. He also travelled extensively to do research on snowfall and glaciers in Greenland, Alaska, and notably the Blue Glacier on Mount Olympus in Washington. He retired to live with his partner, Meg Hunt, in a one-room log cabin in McCarthy, Alaska completely off the grid with solar energy systems and a garden rich diet. The homesite, Porphyry Place, is (at the time of this update 11/2010) of interest to Wrangel St Elias field school, Ed and Meg's longtime neighbors who are raising the money to purchase it. Ed and Meg were in Colorado to attend the memorial service of his former wife, Dolores LaChapelle, in January 2007. They were doing what Ed liked best, skiing powder snow at Monarch Ski Area near Salida, Colorado when he suffered a heart attack at the high altitude. Ed's professional library of research became the property of his son David who in turn placed the collection in the keeping of the San Juan Historical Archive building in Silverton, Colorado through a grant from the Center for Snow and Avalanche Studies. The collection remains on loan thanks to The LaChapelle Library.

Andrew Jerome Wurst, 14, fatally shot 48-year-old John Gillette, and wounded another teacher and two students at Nick's Place (a nearby banquet hall) during an 8th grade dinner dance. Prior to the shooting, Andrew Wurst was described as an average student and somewhat of a loner. One student noticed that he had become curt and unfriendly prior to the shooting, and had told others that he wanted to \\"kill people and commit suicide\\". He was later sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison. He had no diagnosis of mental illness prior to the shooting. Shooting Wurst showed up late to the dance, with his father's .25-caliber pistol in a holster belt under his jacket. He had previously left a suicide note under his pillow, and stated to investigators that he planned to go to the dance and kill only himself. The shooting began on an outdoor patio, about twenty minutes before the dance was scheduled to end, around 9:40. He shot John Gillette after he asked Wurst to come inside. Before running out of ammunition, Wurst proceeded to enter Nick's Place, where the dance had been held, and subsequently fired and wounded Edrye Boraten, a teacher and two students, Jacob Tury and Robert Zemcheck. The shooting ended when the owner of Nick's Place, James Strand, intervened and confronted Wurst with his shotgun, ordering him to drop his weapon and later holding him at bay for eleven minutes. Strand later got Wurst on the ground and searched him for weapons, finding a dinner fork in his sock. Mental condition Wurst was psychotic. At some points, he seems to have thought that everyone was a zombie, already dead. At other times, he said that he was the only real person in the world, with \\"unreal\\" people activated only in his presence. He also claimed he was an alien from another planet, brought to earth as an infant. At school, he sometimes referred to himself as \\"your god, Satan.\\" He had a number of developmental difficulties, reportedly being a bed-wetter as late as age nine. Even at age fourteen he feared monsters in his closet. At school, he wrote stories and made video accounts of fictional murders and suicide.\\" His attack was planned; he attempted to recruit another student to help with the massacre. He mentioned his scheme to other students days before the shooting. He took the gun, stuck it in his waistband, and left a suicide note as he left home. At the party, he showed the gun to his classmates, none of whom reported it to an adult.\\" Trial Wurst's attorneys had considered an insanity defense, but recommended that he plead guilty because it would be hard to convince the jury of an insanity defense. Wurst was charged with attempted murder, third-degree murder, and first-degree murder, and pleaded guilty in a plea bargain to a lesser charge of third-degree murder along with attempted murder to avoid going to trial, and in an attempt to avoid life imprisonment. He is serving a 30 to 60-year sentence in the State Correctional Institution – Forest. He will be eligible for parole in 2029.

His father Harry Leupold was set designer at the D.E.F.A. studio for feature films in Potsdam-Babelsberg.  Life and work  Matthias Leupold completed his photographic education at the D.E.F.A. studio for feature films in Potsdam-Babelsberg. in the early eighties, he started staging photographs in order to express his interest in both photography and film. At first small exhibitions in East Berlin were tolerated by the GDR government. More extensive exhibitions for example at Bauhaus in Dessau and University of Fine Arts in Dresden were forbidden. In 1986, threats of arrest and condemnation influenced his decision to move from East Berlin to West Berlin. He started studying Visual Communications in 1987 at the Berlin University of the Arts (UdK), completing his degree as a master student. He has traveled to many places, including America and Asia, in order to exhibit his work and to photograph in very diverse places. In his series of works, Leupold explores manifestations of picture groups and their social references. In 1988/89, he initiated the Flag Raising Ceremony – Staged Photographs of The Third German Art Exhibition in Dresden 1953, to analyze the year 1953 artistically. Thereby, the pictures of this strict beginning of the formalism debate are taken up and restaged photographically. In 1994, Leupold succeeded to exhibit his visual criticism in the Military Historical Museum in Dresden, where he first began his career. His work hung in the same house in which this far-reaching demonstration of power took place in 1953. Another black and white picture series is inspired by the ideological content of the German magazine Die Gartenlaube (Editor: Ernst Keil) and restaged with effortful characteristics, backgrounds and current clothes.Review Die Gartenlaube Aside from his series, Leupold photographs numerous frames. Actors, models and laymen made chances for his camera productions. Personal and socially relevant topics like solitude, homecoming, protection, neediness, abundance and waste, as well as current events are reflected. Some of his photographs make specific content references to a novel by Robert Musil Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften (The Man without Qualities).Skidmore, James, Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften June 2008, The Literary Encyclopedia Matthias Leupold stayed in the German Academy, Villa Massimo in Rome, from 1997–1998. The mostly color photographs, which were taken there, are characterized by observations of southern light on chapels, sculptures and Madonna Portraits. Most recently, he strayed from his staged photography roots, and roamed into the realm of documentary, creating a full- length film about Vietnamese veterans and their families in the aftermath of Agent Orange usage in the Vietnam war. (2012/13) Matthias Leupold represents a unique figure in the artistic landscape. This is expressed in his contributions to the exhibitions: Art in the GDR, Berlin National Gallery 2003 and Berlin-Moscow/Moscow-Berlin 2004, in Moscow 2004. When it comes to defining Leupold's work and elaborations, one summarizes in three polar tensions: between statics and dynamics, between contemplation and narration, between comic and symbol. In the pictures, these dimensions and categories do not fall apart but merge partly or completely.

According to Obraztsov, An Unusual Concert is a theatrical revue or variety show that does not satirize specific genres so much as performers that spoil these genres with their poor performances and poor taste. An Unusual Concert is one of the best-known puppet performances of the 20th century. It premiered in 1946 and has been performed over 10,000 times all around the world.

Early and family life Born near Brandonville, Virginia (now West Virginia), to James McGrew (1779 - 1873) and his wife Isabella Clark McGrew (1779 - 1867), young James McGrew attended common schools as a child. His ancestors had lived in Preston County since the American Revolutionary war, and his father fought in the War of 1812.Bernard L. Butcher,Genealogical and Personal History of the Upper Monongahela Valley, West Virginia, (Genealogical Publishing Co. 1999) p. 717 available at https://books.google.com/books?id=BN3IEGZANYUC&pg;=PA717&lpg; He married Persis Hagans (1831-1892). Their children who survived to adulthood included William Clark McGrew (1842 - 1919) (who became a banker, railroad executive, state delegate and senator and 5-time mayor of Morgantown), Sarah Martha McGrew Heermans (1844 - 1930) and Rev. George Harrison McGrew (1846 - 1917). Career As an adult, McGrew was a merchant and banker in Kingwood, Virginia. Preston County, Virginia voters elected McGrew and Congressman William Gay Brown, Sr. as their delegates to the Virginia Secession Convention in 1861, where both were Unconditional Unionists and voted against secession on both April 4 (when the ordinance was defeated) and April 17 (when it passed). The Wheeling Convention was held on May 13–15, led by Preston County's William B. Zinn. On June 29, 1861, after Virginia voters approved secession, other delegates expelled them from the convention, and replaced them with secessionist Preston County lawyers Robert E. Cowen and Charles J. P. Cresap.http://www.virginiamemory.com/docs/votes_on_secession.pdf?_ga=1.136899061.456866595.1437301396 Nonetheless, Kingwood voters elected McGrew as their mayor, and voters of Preston and surrounding counties elected him to represent them in the newly created West Virginia House of Delegates alongside Zinn after West Virginia was admitted to the Union. McGrew served in both positions from 1863 to 1865. McGrew also was managing director of the West Virginia Insane Hospital for four years during and after the American Civil War. In 1868, voters elected McGrew as a Republican to the United States House of Representatives, where he served from 1869 to 1873. He was again mayor of Kingwood, West Virginia in 1879 and 1880 and afterwards resumed banking in Kingwood from 1886 until his death. Death and legacy McGrew survived his wife by nearly two decades and lived to see his sons begin their careers in public service. He died in Kingwood on September 18, 1910, and was interred in Maplewood Cemetery. In 1989, the James Clark McGrew Society was formed to foster understanding of this founder of West Virginia. The house which he built in 1841 (and which others later expanded) was restored and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.https://www.theet.com/prestoncountyjournal/news/mcgrew-society- showcasing-history-since/article_bb640868-c9ad-5a46-b120-2d0d4d39d13b.html Now owned by Preston County, the James Clark McGrew House hosts various activities.

This is a first generation mesh where the total available bandwidth of the radio channel is ‘shared’ between all the neighboring nodes in the mesh. The capacity of the channel is further consumed by traffic being forwarded from one node to the next in the mesh – reducing the end to end traffic that can be passed. Because bandwidth is shared amongst all nodes in the mesh, and because every link in the mesh uses additional capacity, this type of network offers much lower end to end transmission rates than a switched mesh and degrades in capacity as nodes are added to the mesh. Wireless mesh nodes typically include both mesh backhaul links and client access. A dual radio shared mesh node uses separate access and mesh backhaul radios. Only the mesh backhaul radio is shared. In a single radio shared mesh node, access and mesh backhaul are collapsed onto a single radio. Now the available bandwidth is shared between both the mesh links and client access, further reducing the end to end traffic available.

Each dedicated mesh link is on a separate channel, ensuring that forwarded traffic does not use any bandwidth from any other link in the mesh. As a result, a switched mesh is capable of much higher capacities and transmission rates than a shared mesh and grows in capacity as nodes are added to the mesh.

First founded in 1962 by Milton C. Anderson, the group was credited with being the first show choir in America, mixing choreography with choral singing. While experiencing national television exposure early on, The Young Americans later taught music to students in the United States and other parts of the world as advocates of music education in their International Music Outreach Tours. The group has approximately 200 young people between the ages of 16 and 25 from nearly every US state and several other countries.  History  Members of The Young Americans performing in 2007 1960s The Young Americans first appeared on a Bing Crosby television special in the early 1960s. For the next several years, the group would appear on numerous variety shows, singing and dancing with entertainers such as Julie Andrews, Judy Garland, and Bob Hope. In 1967, the group was featured in a film, Young Americans, which was awarded a 1968 Academy Award for best documentary. In May 1969, the film was disqualified because it had premiered in October 1967, and was therefore ineligible for the 1968 award. 1970s and 1980s Throughout the 1970s, along with television appearances with Julie Andrews, The Ed Sullivan Show, Kraft Music Hall, and their own television special with Lorne Greene, The Young Americans began concert tours in the United States and abroad at venues that included Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Madison Square Garden, the Hollywood Bowl, and with Liberace in Las Vegas. In 1976, the group performed in an outdoor theatre at the foot of the Washington Monument for the United States bicentennial celebration. In the 1980s, the group continued to tour internationally. The choir's performances for Liberace in the early eighties were featured in the HBO film Behind the Candelabra, based on the book by Liberace's lover Scott Thorson. The latter sections of the film highlight the relationship between Liberace and Young Americans alumnus Cary James, Liberace's lover who died of AIDS in 1995. The affair between Liberace and James is depicted as a major source of tension between Thorson and Liberace. During the film, The Young Americans sing \\"I Belong With You.\\" 1990s The International Music Outreach Tour was established in 1992 with the aim to show the importance of school music programs. During 10-week tours, the group will visit 2 schools per week presenting 3-day performance workshops to 4th-12th (USA) grade students (internationally ages 5 – 19) . Now touring 7 times per year, the group regularly travels throughout the United States, as well as overseas in countries such as the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Poland, Russia, Switzerland, Spain, Gibraltar, the Ukraine, Japan, Australia and Latvia. 2000s In addition to teaching on the outreach tours, the group is more recently focusing on the creation of its own college, The Young Americans College of the Performing Arts. In the summer months, a cast of Young Americans reside in Harbor Springs, Michigan to host a dinner theatre at Boyne Highlands (a Boyne USA resort), that has been running for over 40 years.  Conservatory The Young Americans College of the Performing Arts (formerly: California Pacific College of the Performing Arts) is a performing arts conservatory in the Greater Los Angeles Area in the United States. It was affiliated with North Central Michigan College until 2019 and has an enrollment of about 200 students in dance, music, drama and teaching methods.

Greater Gabbard is a 504 MW wind farm on sandbanks off the coast of Suffolk in England at a cost of £1.5 billion. Onshore construction activities commenced in early July 2008 at Sizewell. It was completed on 7 September 2012 with all of the Siemens SWT3.6–107 turbines connected. A 336 MW extension of the project called Galloper Wind Farm was commissioned in April 2018.  History  The project was originally developed by Greater Gabbard Offshore Winds Limited (GGOWL) which was a joint venture between Airtricity and Fluor. Airtricity was subsequently bought by Scottish and Southern Energy who have bought out Fluor's 50% stake for £40m which is expected to cost £1.3b. Fluor are now contracted to design, supply, installation and commissioning of the balance of the plant. Scottish and Southern sold a 50% stake to RWE, the owners of Npower, in November 2008 for £308m. The project was given the go-ahead in May 2008 and work started in June. In July 2011 erection of the turbines was two- thirds complete, with all the pile foundations installed. In October 2009 Seajacks Ltd delivered its 7,000 tonne Leviathan vessel to Fluor Ltd which sailed to Harwich to prepare the hook-up and commissioning of an in-field substation and then installation of the turbines. The first foundations were installed in autumn 2009 with the first of a total of 140 turbines installed in the spring 2010. Electricity generation began on 29 December 2010 and construction was completed on 7 September 2012. During April 2014 to March 2015 the wind farm produced 1.7 TWh, corresponding to a capacity factor of 39%.Events on Greater Gabbard 4C. Retrieved April 2016.

Galloper extension Galloper windfarm with the turbines of Inner Gabbard visible behind An extension of the project, called Galloper, was agreed in May 2013. The proposal was to add up to 140 turbines to the development, producing up to 504 MW of electricity. The wind farm was expected to be completed in 2017.Galloper offshore wind farm gets green light , Inside Government, 24 May 2013.

In November 2013 the project capacity was reduced to 68 turbines producing 340 MW. In March 2014, SSE announced that it would be pulling out of the project. In October 2014 RWE Innogy announced that it too was abandoning the project, but in December the company revealed that it was still seeking potential investment partners. In October 2015 RWE Innogy secured the financing of the project with three other investors each taking 25% of the project - Macquarie Capital, UK Green Investment Bank and Siemens Financial Services. Siemens Wind Power has been awarded the turbine supply contract to deliver 56 Siemens SWT-6.0-154 turbines. At the September 2018 formal inauguration Galloper is officially 353 MW . It is owned by innogy SE (25%), Siemens Financial Services (25%), Sumitomo Corporation (12.5%), ESB (12.5%) and a consortium managed by Green Investment Group and Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets (25%). Innogy SE led development and construction of the windfarm and will operate it on behalf of the project partners. A robot scarecrow reduces dangerous levels of bird poo on the substation.

Hall was one of America's first combat aviators, flying with the famed Lafayette Escadrille in France before the U.S. entered World War I. Biography Hall was born near Higginsville, Missouri, the son of George Hall. Bert Hall during WW I Bert Hall learned to fly in 1910 at Buc, France, using a \\"Maurice Farman Biplane Pusher, with a fog-cutter out in front and an air-cooled Renault motor behind.\\" He subsequently acquired a \\"new 1913 Bleriot, equipped with a 60 H.P. Gnome motor\\", and on February 16, 1913, he along with his French mechanic André Pierce became soldiers of fortune flying for the Sultan of Turkey, Akbdul Hamid, for $100 American dollars a day, against the Bulgarians. The first day he was paid in Turkish currency and refused to fly, but received \\"in gold money\\" from then on. After two months the Turkish Army payments became inconsistent \\"fifty dollars one day and sixty the next and forty-five the next\\", so Bert and André \\"packed up and flew into Roumania (sic), stopping at Bucharest ... receiving the equivalent of one hundred dollars gold per day in advance.\\". After 30 days the Bulgars welshed, but before Bert and his mechanic could depart with their gold, Bert was arrested, leaving André to bribe the jailers for Bert's release. After a brief barn storming tour through Ukraine, his Bleriot motor quit over the Pyrenees Mountains outside of Tarbes and crashed. He salvaged the motor for 2,500 francs. In early August 1914, Bert met renowned big game hunter René Philezot and both enlisted as infantry in the French Foreign Legion Deuxiéme (Second) Regiment, which had been redeployed from Morocco to France for trench warfare. In early October, 1914, Bill Thaw, Jimmy Bach, and Bert applied for aviation, and on December 14, 1914, the three entered \\"into the French Flying Corps.\\" Bert was one of the seven original members of the Lafayette Escadrille. They included two of the original three applicants—Bill Thaw and Bert Hall, (Jimmy Bach was in the French Flying Corps, but was in a German Prison camp before the LE was organized); Norman (Nimmie) Prince, Frazier Curtiss and Elliot Cowdin joined on March 9, 1914; with the final addition of Raoul Lufbery and Didier Masson. However, he was greatly disliked by his comrades. Besides having an abrasive personality, he was known to be a liar. Dennis Gordon wrote a book called Autobiographies of the Lafayette Escadrille published by the Doughboy Historical Society - POB 3912 Missoula, MT 59806. According to this book, Bert Hall did get four confirmed kills in the LS and several medals and was the squadron adjutant. But he was a four-flusher, a liar, a deserter and a good poker player who could read his opponents. and usually cleaned the table. Hall wrote two books about his exploits in the Lafayette Escadrille, En L'air (1918) and One Man's War: The Story of the Lafayette Escadrille (1929). The former was the basis of the 1918 film A Romance of the Air, in which he starred as himself. In the book One Man's War: The Story of the Lafayette Escadrille, Bert Hall recounts how after he was taken off the front lines due to the mumps, he was to recover in the south of France, versus Paris where he had an apartment and female acquaintances. At the train depot he encountered a wounded soldier who was to recover in Paris, versus the south of France where he was from. So they mutually exchanged their destination \\"tags\\", Bert gave him all his cigarettes, and then shook his hand very gently. In this he admitted that he circumvented the French Army, and that he \\"always did object to doing things by the numbers anyhow\\". He also tells of forcing a German Albatross down in French territory, and contrasts his own personal style versus his mechanic, Leon Mourreau, who also deserved credit as gunner in his early two seat Nieuport: \\"... my mechanic came in for no small part of this catch, and he deserved it too. But he was a modest fellow, and not nearly as good a talker as I was. Talking up one's exploits had its advantages, even in a big caliber war. And finally, Bert Hall persistently refers to his fellow pilots and commanders in glowing and respectful terms, with rare exceptions. And if some were envious and sought to discredit his achievements, he did not reciprocate. In civilian life, he contracted with the Chinese government to buy surplus planes from the U.S. government and return to China to set up an air service for them, but failed to obtain permission from the State Department. He was charged with violating export restrictions and convicted. Bert Hall was released from McNeil Island Federal Penitentiary in May 1936.24, 2016 His effort anticipated the July 7, 1937 Second Sino-Japanese War wherein Clair Chennault assessed the Chinese Air Force and received Washington approval of the American Volunteer Group (\\"Flying Tigers\\"). Deployment of aircraft, aircrews, and supplies to China began in the spring of 1941. He lived in Seattle for a few months before heading to Hollywood to work for Twentieth Century Fox studios. Weary of Hollywood, in 1940 he moved to Dayton, Ohio and in 1944 settled in Castalia, Ohio, where he started the Sturdy Toy Factory. On December 6, 1948, he died of a massive heart attack while driving down the highway near Fremont, Ohio. His ashes were scattered over his hometown of Higginsville, Missouri on January 20, 1950.

He played as a defender and midfielder for, among others, UTA Arad, Vasas SC, Honvéd and Hungary. During the 1950s, he was a prominent member of the legendary Hungarian national team known as the Mighty Magyars, which also included Ferenc Puskás, Zoltán Czibor, Sándor Kocsis, József Bozsik and Nándor Hidegkuti. After retiring as a player, Lóránt became a coach, most notably with Honvéd, FC Bayern Munich and PAOK Thessaloniki FC. While at PAOK, he guided them to a Greek Championship title in 1976. On 31 May 1981, while still working as coach, he suffered a heart attack, watching PAOK play Olympiacos CFP and died at the game, aged 58. Early life The son of a policeman, who fought as a volunteer in World War II on the German side, Lóránt turned professional footballer at the age of 16; in parallel, he then also studied economics at university in the 1950s. Gyula Lóránt began his career as a youth with his hometown club, Kõszeg SE, after encouragement from a local trainer. He then played for Nagyváradi AC and UT Arad in Romania. It was while at Vasas SC, where his teammates included Ladislao Kubala, that his career prospered. However, in January 1949, as Hungary became a communist state, Kubala fled the country in the back of a truck and formed his own team Hungaria to play exhibition friendlies. The team was made up of fellow refugees fleeing Eastern Europe. Lóránt also attempted to escape and follow Kubala, but was captured and ended up in a detention camp. Hungarian international Lóránt was released from detention after the intervention of Gusztáv Sebes, the national team coach, who regarded him as pivotal to his plans. Lóránt then made his debut for Hungary on 19 October 1949 in an away game against Austria. Sebes personally guaranteed the country's Interior Minister and future Prime Minister, János Kádár, that Lóránt would not abscond while in Vienna. Kádár agreed and Lóránt responded with a superb performance as Hungary won 4–3. He subsequently joined Honvéd where together with six of his fellow internationals, he helped the team win three Hungarian League titles.

Death Lóránt died on 31 May 1981, while working as a trainer of PAOK, during a game against Olympiacos CFP. He suffered a heart attack in the 16th minute of the match after PAOK's Giorgos Koudas headed a cross into the side of the net from close range. He was tried to be resuscitated on the spot and then moved to the club doctor's room but died before the ambulance arrived. PAOK players were told in the break that he had to be transported to the hospital and his death was revealed only after the game. PAOK eventually won the match 1–0 with the goal of the substitute Vassilis Vasilakos who sat next to Lóránt on the bench when he collapsed. The autopsy revealed that he had at least two more previous heart attacks, the second one at longest one week before his death. Lóránt was buried in Endingen, Germany, but in 2011 at the request of his widow, his ashes were transported to Hungary and reburied in his birth town, Kőszeg.

It is on the Kalininsko–Solntsevskaya line. The station was opened on 30 December 1979. The station is built in a three-vault configuration 53 metres (173 feet) underground. The central hallway contains a sculpture made out of anodised gold pyramids and tetrahedra. The architects of the station are A.F. Strelkov, V.I. Klokov, N.I. Demchinsky, J.A. Kolesnikov, and E.S. Barsky. The theme of Aviamotornaya is aviation and flying. The columns holding up the ceiling are glazed in a light marble tone. The floor is made up of granite plates coloured in different shades of grey. The wall at the end of the central hallway is faced in a metal sculpture depicting Icarus. There are decorations mentioning and detailing the main constellations. Station platform Escalator accident in 1982 The escalators of the station caused a significant disaster on the Moscow Metro on February 17, 1982, that killed at least eight people. As evening rush-hour approached, escalator #4 was turned on at 16:30 Moscow time. As the first commuters began to use it to descend, a poorly-attached step came loose, completing the cycle of coming all the way down and then back up on the opposite end of the chain. At 17:00, as it passed the upper mechanism, it got stuck and deformed the upper working gears and rods. This broke the clutch between the driving gears of the engine, and the thread, now free to move in any direction, began to accelerate from the weight of the passengers. Automatically the engine was immediately turned off and the brakes were applied. However, the standard working brakes lacked the strength to stop the momentum of the thread (heavily laden with passengers at this rush-hour), or even to reduce its acceleration. For such a case, all escalators are equipped with additional emergency brakes, and Aviamotornaya's escalators had received completely new models three months prior. Moreover, two days before the accident, there had been a routine safety check, which found that the emergency brakes were incorrectly configured throughout; after necessary amendments, a simulation deemed all of the four escalators' emergency brakes to be satisfactory. However, that was not the case. The chief mechanic in charge had used instructions for the old braking system to install the new brakes (which were being introduced on all escalators in the Metro at the time) on the particular escalator model at Aviamotornaya. The resulting wrong configuration in both mechanism and circuitry did not allow for them to automatically turn on. Even when the escalator supervisor saw that the thread had accelerated to 2.4 times faster than its maximum rate and attempted to manually operate the brakes, nothing happened. 110 seconds after it began, the accident was over. With the exception of a vague note in Vechernyaya Moskva, the state-controlled Soviet press made no reference to the event. This resulted in thousands of rumours and panic immediately spreading throughout the city. No person was actually sucked into the machine bay. All of the eight people who died were crushed at the base of the escalator by other passengers who did not have time to move away, forming an obstruction. Some did attempt to jump out of the way by climbing onto the balustrade, but the thin plastic coating could not withstand the weight and collapsed (thus the rumours), yet those who did fall through would have hit a solid concrete foundation with no moving parts of any sort a few metres under the balustrade, with most suffering minor injuries. As the wounded were carried off, at 17:10 the station was put on exit only and at 17:35 closed altogether. Immediately an investigation was launched, where it was determined that the speedometer was wrongly wired to the emergency brake and that all of the three other escalators at the station were prone to similar disaster. After the accident, the Soviet medics have counted 8 dead and 30 injured.

Family  Maxim Kantor was born in Moscow on 22 December 1957. His father, Karl Kantor, who was born in Argentina, was a philosopher, an art historian, and a design theorist who founded the Moscow magazine “Decorative Arts”. His grandfather self-exiled to Argentina in 1909 and returned to Soviet Russia with his family in 1926. His mother Tatiana was a geneticist who created some hybrids that were internationally licensed. In 1980 Maxim Kantor graduated from the Moscow State University of Printing Art. After 1982 he took part in unofficial exhibitions. In 1983 he founded in Moscow the underground art group “Krasnyj Dom” (Red House). In 1984 he was organizer and speaker of a renowned one-day show of the group in Moscow Institute of Philosophy. In 2016 he became a German citizen. Maxim Kantor lives and works on Ile de Ré (France), Berlin and Oxford. Kantor is a member of the Russian Academy of Fine Arts.  Painter  As a painter Maxim Kantor \\"didn't want to study under anybody and his father (the philosopher Karl Kantor) was all he needed\\", but he was deeply influenced by Michelangelo, Mantegna, Goya, Breughel, Van Gogh, Grunewald and Petrov Vodkin. Maxim Kantor never joined any artistic group, but rather kept to his own independent message. His personal style was never influenced by fashions or current streams. In Soviet times he became a watchful observer of society and a sharp political critic. Kantor holds the same line up to now both in his country and in the West. For years, he has been developing the themes which moved him. Almost always those themes reflected socio-political situation in his Motherland or in the world. He created series of large paintings and graphic works which always dovetailed with his fiction works and public statements and essays. In 1997 he represented the Russian Federation on 47 Biennale d’Arte di Venezia in the Russian pavilion with the personal Exhibition Criminal Chronicle. He held exhibitions in many different countries and in a great number of important museums around the world, among which Moscow State Tretyakov Gallery, Saint-Petersburg State Russian Museum, Hannover Sprengel Museum, Frankfurt Staedel Museum, British Museum, Luxembourg National Museum.

Chonkadze was born to a peasant family near Dusheti. His native village housed a mixed Georgian-Ossetian community, a prerequisite for the future writer's lively interest in both Georgian and Ossetian folk traditions. Educated at the seminaries of Vladikavkaz and Tbilisi, Chonkadze then taught Ossetic in Stavropol and Tbilisi in the 1850s. Simultaneously he served as a church official, but would later abandon his clerical status. Much of his work was on Georgian and Ossetic folklore. He authored an unfinished Russian-Ossetic dictionary, and wrote down a collection of Ossetic proverbs using an alphabet invented by Professor Andreas Sjögren for the Ossetians. Чонкадзе (Даниил, 1830 - 1860). Russian Biographic Dictionary. Retrieved on February 19, 2007. For this reason, he is considered by some to have been \\"a founder-father of Ossetic literature\\".Rayfield, Donald (2000), The Literature of Georgia: A History: 2nd edition, p. 153. Routledge, Chonkadze’s first and last published work, Suramis tsikhe, garnered a long-lasting success. Published in 1859/60 in the Georgian literary journal Tsiskari (\\"Dawn\\"), the novella is a mixture of folklore, history, political protest, and romantic drama in which Chonkadze passionately attacks serfdom. For censorship reasons, the tale was given a medieval setting filled with allegories. The contemporary socio-political system is symbolized by the crumbling Surami fortress that requires a living person to be buried within its walls to stand firm. The novel was filmed by the eminent Armenian filmmaker Sergei Parajanov who directed his multi-award- winning The Legend of Suram Fortress in the 1980s. Chonkadze died of tuberculosis at the age of thirty, and many of his writings were destroyed by his relatives as a potential source of infection. The graves of D.

Stretching west from Mynttorget over to Riddarhustorget, it is crossed by the streets Salviigränd, Rådhusgränd, Riddarhusgränd, and Storkyrkobrinken. Most of the buildings surrounding the street are occupied by either the Parliament or the Supreme Court.  History  While the square Mynttorget was named for its proximity to the Royal Mint and is present on a map dated 1733 AD, the name of the street Myntgatan is most likely much younger. On a map from the 1630s it is called Skattmestere Gattun (\\"Treasurer's Street\\"), probably in reference to Gabriel Bengtsson Oxenstierna (1586–1656) who owned a single land parcel by the street. It has also been referred to as Salviigränd.Gatunamn, p 61-62 Following the completion of Stora Nygatan in the 1660s, it was realized that this new boulevard-like street, a pride for a still largely medieval Stockholm, could not end up blindly in what was then a peripheral end of the city – an insight which led to the gradual creation of Myntgatan which forms a perpendicular angle to Stora Nygatan in the Baroque manner of the era.Hall, p 61 The street was thus extended east to Mynttorget as the latter was created in 1672 and the old defensive tower, Norre port, was demolished. It was then called Riddargatan (\\"Knight's Street\\") or Riddarhusgatan (\\"Knight's House Street\\") until the late-19th century in references to Riddarhuset, but apparently different names were used for the eastern and western ends of the street.

A wardrobe stylist, also fashion stylist, is a consultant who selects the clothing for published editorial features, print or television advertising campaigns, music videos, concert performances, and any public appearances made by celebrities, models or other public figures. Stylists are often part of a larger creative team assembled by the client, collaborating with the fashion designer, photographer/director, hair stylist, and makeup artist to put together a particular look or theme for the specific project. A wardrobe stylist can also be referred to as a fashion stylist, fashion editor, or celebrity stylist. According to one view, \\"Stylists are the people who push each celebrity to make the best dressed list,\\" and assist with editorial photo shoots. The job description varies greatly depending on the assignment. Stylists in the editorial and celebrity fields work primarily with designer samples, which are shown during fashion presentations and are lent to members of the fashion press during the 4–6 months before retail sales begin. High-level stylists may collaborate directly with designers to produce custom clothing for celebrity clients or editorials; this is common for celebrity stylists whose clients attend awards shows and for fashion editors at top magazines. Stylists may also provide services such as personal shopping, restructuring a client's entire wardrobe, reorganizing a client's closet, or other duties relating to the client's personal lifestyle. A wardrobe stylist is distinct from a costume designer, the person who clothes characters in film, television, or theater. A wardrobe stylist is also distinct from an image consultant or a color consultant. A person can be a color consultant without knowing the basic principles of line or style. An image consultant is an expert in both color and line, and may work with business professionals or individuals, as opposed to celebrities in particular. A color consultant's aim is to identify the most flattering colors for their client, while the goal of an image consultant is to tell a story about the client through clothes, shapes, and colors. Business arrangements Wardrobe stylists can be paid an hourly wage, a day rate, or a project rate. Editorial assignments tend to pay less money, while advertising campaigns, commercials, or spokesperson campaigns tend to pay the most. Some freelance fashion editors, that is, stylists who work exclusively in producing editorial content, may receive a rate per page in a given publication; fashion editors typically negotiate this rate on a yearly basis, during which time the publication will assign a certain number of project pages to be completed. Stylists may also be paid a flat fee for the length of a project, usually called a buy out. Some stylists can be put on a monthly retainer, in which they are paid a set fee for a period of time and are on call for the entire time period. Wardrobe stylists are sometimes represented by agencies that specialize in representing wardrobe stylists, hair stylists, and makeup artists. When a wardrobe stylist is represented by an agency, the agency usually books all of their work or assignments for a fee, usually ranging between 10% and 20% of the stylist's fee. The agency ensures that the stylist's needs are met, typically guaranteeing that transportation and travel and accommodations are all taken care of before the wardrobe stylist takes an assignment. Agencies usually expedite the client's payment and make sure that the wardrobe stylist is paid in full within 30 to 60 days of completion of the assignment. Training Most stylists acquire professional skills and knowledge by assisting other glamorous, established stylists, in a system similar to apprenticeship. Connections and experience are important. For example, after studying at the Rhode Island School of Design, celebrity stylist Elizabeth Sulcer apprenticed with British fashion designer Alexander McQueen for several years; Models Magazine, biography Elizabeth Sulcer, Retrieved Aug. 28, 2014, \\"...Fashion Editor/Stylist... Elizabeth Sulcer, ... tapped by Alexander McQueen ... Rhode Island School of Design...\\" later, she worked as fashion editor for BlackBook magazine where she hired intern LaQuan Smith, who soon established himself in New York as a leading clothing designer; LEAH CHERNIKOF, February 12, 2010, New York Daily News, Fashion designer LaQuan Smith, from Queens, is 21-year-old Fashion Week virgin, Retrieved Aug. 28, 2014, \\"Smith ... scoring an internship with BlackBook magazine, working for fashion editor Elizabeth Sulcer...\\" later, as an established freelancer, she hires interns regularly. WINNIE LIU, JAN 23, 2013, Fashionista magazine, STYLIST ELIZABETH SULCER IS LOOKING FOR SPRING & SUMMER INTERNS IN NYC!, Retrieved Aug. 28, 2014, \\"...Elizabeth regularly styles editorials for Numero Paris, Vogue Italia, Vogue China, Vogue Russia, as well as advertising campaigns for Herve Leger, BCBG, Express, and Claire's. ...\\" Stylist assistants are typically hired at a rate between $150 to $350 a day. Assistants' responsibilities can vary greatly depending on the stylist and the assignment. Some are hired only to perform physical labor, such as setting up for a client fitting or returning samples to a press showroom; others may help the stylist with selecting wardrobe options, preparing clients for public events, or any other task needed to complete an assignment. According to one report in Seventeen Magazine, there were no specific education majors helpful for becoming a fashion stylist, but that degrees in fashion design, tailoring, merchandising, communications, marketing, color harmonies, art history and photography, understanding of the human body - how it stores fat and ages, psychology and how women's perception changes to color, could be helpful, but overall it was helpful to read fashion magazines regularly to develop a \\"great eye for fashion\\".

Thought to be a city within the plains of Galilee north of Mt. Tabor in Israel which was cursed by the angel of God in the song of Deborah and Barak; whose inhabitants did not come to help the Israelites in battle against Sisera's army. Meroz may possibly be identified with el-Murussus, a village about 5 miles Northwest of Beisan, on the slopes to the North of the Vale of Jezreel. The village of Kafr Misr has also been identified as a possible site, due its proximity to other nearby ancient sites such as Nein (Nain) and Indur (Endor).Wilson, 1847, p. 107. > Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of YHWH, curse ye bitterly the inhabitants > thereof; because they came not to the help of YHWH, to the help of YHWH > against the mighty. -Judges 5:23  Meroz in the Talmud  According to the Talmud (Moed Katan 16a), Meroz is a certain planet in the stellar sphere, and because the mention of it in Judges 5:23 is preceded by the phrase, \\"the stars in their course fought against Sisera\\" (v.20), it thus follows that Meroz must be defined as a celestial body. http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/160985/jewish/What-does- Judaism-say-about-the-Discovery-of-Aliens.htm This mysterious 'Meroz' may not only be the name of a star, but also may allude to angels somewhere in the second heaven who have failed in their willingness to assist the righteous in a war against the wicked, and hence cursed by the angel of God.  Meroz in later thought  In Protestant thought, the \\"sin of Meroz\\" refers to apathy or a failure to testify. In John Buchan's Witch Wood, set at the time of the Covenanters, the narrator says of the protagonist, David Semphill, that \\"he felt that it was his duty to testify, or otherwise he would be guilty of the sin of Meroz, the sin of apathy when his faith was challenged.John Buchan, Witch Wood,p. 38. At the time of the American Revolution, Patriot writers argued that the Loyalists were guilty of the sin of Meroz, in that they neglected to defend their country, religion and liberty.Erab Shalev, \\"Evil Councilors, Corrupt Traitors, and Bad Kings: The Hebrew Bible and Political Critique in Revolutionary America,\\" in Dustin Gish and Daniel Klinghard (eds.), Resistance to Tyrants, Obedience to God: The Mutual Influence of Religion and Reason at the American Founding (Lexington Books, 2013), p. 113.

He is best known for his Broadway work as director of the hit musicals Hair and Jesus Christ Superstar. During his career he sought to achieve a form of \\"total theater\\" described by The New York Times as \\"wittily physical\\", and which earned him a reputation as the \\"Busby Berkeley of the acid set\\". Biography=Early years Born in Chicago, Illinois, O'Horgan was introduced to theater by his father, a newspaper owner and sometimes actor, who took him to shows and built him footlights and a wind machine. As a child he sang in churches and wrote operas, including one entitled Doom of the Earth at age 12.\\"Tom O'Horgan, 84, Director of Hair, Is Dead\\", by Douglas Martin, January 13, 2009, The New York Times O'Horgan received his degree from DePaul University where he learned to play dozens of musical instruments. After graduating he worked in Chicago as a harpist and also performed with the Second City, the Chicago improvisational theater company. He moved to New York City and began acting downtown at places like Judson Memorial Church. During this time he developed a night club act where he performed improvisational humor as he accompanied himself on the harp. Career O'Horgan thought of his work as \\"kinetic sculpture\\" and said that his goal was to be \\"able to blend all aspects of the theatre without letting any part become secondary to the others\\". Of contemporary commercial theater, he believed that people are \\"hung up on chandeliers because they insist that the one-dimensional, verbal Ibsenite theater is the only theater. But this is an aberration of the 19th century. If the ideas are the primary thing, it's not theater. Theater has always meant music, dance, art. That's what the Greek theater was.\\" Shortly after Hair opened on Broadway, Eleanore Lester wrote in The New York Times: \\"O'Horgan, a veteran of many years of experimentation and frustration in his search for The Way in theater, successfully incorporates a number of strands coming on strong in the rapidly evolving post-Miller-Williams-Albee and post-absurdist theater. Those trends, growing partly out of the intimate Off Off Broadway movement and partly out of the visceral political drama of be-ins, sit-ins and demonstrations, include the use of improvisational techniques, vigorous ensemble playing, a more physical style of acting, greater use of dance, music, and puppets, and Pop- camp comedy – plus the Total Theater concept in which the audience becomes more closely involved in the work.\\" O'Horgan said that an element of his artistic gratification is \\"just getting the vicarious joy of turning people on, making them respond, turning them on to their own sensual powers that are buried under layers of cement. When you see how people in the streets will run to see a fire or an accident or a fight, hoping against hope to see something really happen, something that will prove that the people walking beside them are more than mere mannequins, you realize how much they want to break out of all their emotional rigidity.\\" Though he would become well known for his Broadway work, he was more comfortable in the Off-Broadway world. As he told Lester in 1968, \\"Sure, I've been sent scripts from Broadway offices, but so far I haven't seen anything that I could possibly be interested in. Of course, I'll continue working with La MaMa. Where else can you work things out? Certainly not on Broadway where the meter is always running.\\" =Off-Broadway and Off-Off-Broadway= Most of his early career work was in Off-Off-Broadway experimental theatre productions. One of his earliest projects was Love and Vexations at the Caffe Cino in September, 1963.Spotlight on Tom O'Horgan, Christopher Borg, Jan 22, 2009, nyitawards.com Soon thereafter, his friend James Wigfall introduced him to Ellen Stewart (founder of La MaMa, E.T.C.), who would go on to become one of his staunchest supporters. The first play he directed there was The Maids by Jean Genet in 1964,Of Course, There Were Some Limits, Eleanore Lester, O'Horgan feature article in the NY Times, May 19, 1968, michaelbutler.com and he later led a La MaMa troupe that went to Denmark to showcase early plays by Sam Shepard and Lanford Wilson.

Clive Barnes wrote in The New York Times, \\"Mr. O'Horgan ... has visualized Futz! as some kind of Dionysiac dance, wild and fevered. He sends his actors mugging and careening across the stage in great joyous surges of energy.\\" Hair authors James Rado and Gerome Ragni attended the La MaMa production of Futz! and it influenced them to choose O'Horgan to direct Hair on Broadway. In November 1974, he conceived and directed a stage adaptation of The Beatles' classic recording Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The show, entitled Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band on the Road, played at the Beacon Theater concert venue on Manhattan's Upper West Side. The production, developed in collaboration with Hair set designer Robin Wagner, featured 34 actors performing 29 Beatles songs with elaborate scenery, special effects and colorful costumes. The show was not well received by critics and closed in January 1975 after 66 performances.The Theater Will Rock, Elizabeth Wollman, pp. 105–06, books.google.com Among O'Horgan's other off-Broadway credits include the Second City revues at the Village East To the Water Tower, When the Owl Screams, and The Wrecking Ball as composer, as well as Masked Men (at the Westbeth Theatre) and Birdbath as director. =BroadwayHair O'Horgan made his Broadway directorial debut in 1968 with the ground-breaking musical, Hair. Based on his growing reputation with Futz! and other off-off-Broadway plays he directed, Hair authors Ragni and Rado sought out O'Horgan to direct the Off-Broadway production of the show when it opened at The Public Theater in the fall of 1967, but O'Horgan was working in Europe at the time and was unable to accept the invitation. When the show made the transition uptown to Broadway, O'Horgan was called again and this time he was able to accept. Hair underwent a massive overhaul from its downtown version to its Broadway opening in April 1968. The Off-Broadway book, already light on plot, was loosened even further, and 13 new songs were added. O'Horgan said that \\"I see [Hair] as a singspiel, a popular opera.\\" In rehearsals, he used techniques passed down by Viola Spolin and Paul Sills of improvisational \\"games\\" and role playing theories that encouraged freedom and spontaneity. Many of these improvisations were incorporated into the Broadway script. He prepared actors by having them undress in slow motion, praying to God and Buddha and jostling one another. He had them deliver lines while being carried around or doing handstands. The Playbill for the 2009 Broadway revival of Hair says O'Horgan and new choreographer Julie Arenal infused the production with a sense of \\"freedom and spontaneity, introducing an organic, expansive style of staging\\" that had never been seen before on Broadway.Haun, Harry. \\"Age of Aquarius\\", Playbill, April 2009, from Hair at the Al Hirschfeld Theatre Also, O'Horgan had used nudity in many of the plays he directed, and he helped integrate the idea into the fabric of the show.The Peace, Love and Freedom Party, Patrick Pacheco, June 17, 2001, latimes.com Some credit him with transforming \\"a mildly successful off-Broadway musical into a Broadway hit\\". O'Horgan said that the experience gave him the opportunity to help create \\"a theater form whose demeanor, language, clothing, dance, and even its name accurately reflect a social epoch in full explosion\\". He believed that the actors in Hair, some from \\"right off the street\\", made an important contribution to Broadway theater. He said that \\"the kids are talking their own language, they're expressing their real sex attitudes and they're laying it on the line about race and miscegenation. The kids on stage are authentic and people sense this.\\" Of its wider impact, he contentiously stated that \\"Hair is an assault on the theatrical dead area: Broadway. It's almost an effort to give Broadway mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.\\" Lenny and Jesus Christ Superstar The next Broadway project for O'Horgan was to direct the Julian Barry play Lenny, with Cliff Gorman as controversial comedian-satirist Lenny Bruce. Lenny opened at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre in May 1971, across the street from the Biltmore Theater where Hair was still running. The play followed Bruce's nightclub career through run-ins with the police and the courts, and put the same language on a Broadway stage that had gotten Bruce—who died in 1966—arrested in nightclubs just a few years earlier.\\"Cliff Gorman, 65, Portrayer of Lenny Bruce on Broadway\\", September 13, 2002, The New York Times Lenny ran on Broadway for 453 performances until June 1972 and won Gorman a Tony for best actor in a play. That same year O'Horgan would also direct the 1971 Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Jesus Christ Superstar that became popular with audiences and that, like Hair, would later be made into a movie. Superstar was notable for the performance of Ben Vereen as Judas Iscariot – whom O'Horgan directed previously on Broadway in the role of Hud in Hair. According to playwright Robert Patrick, O'Horgan didn't want to accept the job but relented finally because he said \\"Bob ... You wouldn't believe the money they just offered me.\\"Robert Patrick Shares a Memory of Tom O'Horgan, Michael Dale, Jan 12, 2009, broadwayworld.com Other Broadway work Additional Broadway directing credits include the Tony Award-winning Inner City (1971), a musical conceived by O'Horgan based on controversial poetry book The Inner City Mother Goose by Eve Merriam;\\"Eve Merriam, 75, Poet and Author Who Wrote for Children, Is Dead\\", Bruce Lambert, The New York Times the musical Dude (1972), written by Hair author Gerome Ragni with music by Hair composer Galt MacDermot; The Leaf People (1975), a Joe Papp-produced play by Dennis Reardon depicting the first contact by white men with a hostile tribe of Amazonian Indians;, iub.edu and I Won't Dance (1981), a murder whodunit play by Oliver Hailey.Oliver Hailey on Doollee play database, doollee.com At one point in 1971, there were four simultaneous O'Horgan-directed productions on Broadway – Hair, Jesus Christ Superstar, Lenny, and Inner City.Tom O'Horgan, Groundbreaking Director of Superstar, Hair and More, Has Died, Kenneth Jones, Jan 12, 2009, playbill.com =Film= O'Horgan directed and composed the score for the screen adaptation of Futz with Frederic Forrest, Sally Kirkland, and Jennifer O'Neill, and directed the film version of Eugène Ionesco's Rhinoceros starring Zero Mostel, Gene Wilder, and Karen Black (and which featured a score by Hair composer Galt MacDermot).

The walls were covered with his impressive collection of unusual musical instruments from throughout the world. His loft was visited by children's television host Fred Rogers on a 1985 episode of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood.Episode 1550, IMDB, accessed June 7, 2015. Many instruments were displayed in order of their history, from antique to current. There was also an alcove of gongs, including the one used in Jesus Christ Superstar. Robertson, Campbell. \\"For Sale: Odds and Ends of a Life in the Theater\\". New York Times. November 1, 2007 He and his friends rang in many a New Year there, where at midnight everyone would take an instrument off the wall, or find a drum or a gong, and celebrate with an abandon and joy that O'Horgan so often set the stage for (both personally and professionally). He also held the weddings of two close friends there. Martha Wingate married Hunt Taylor there in 1980, and Soni Moreno married Harry Primeau there a few years later. Tom O'Horgan was the initial representation of a father figure to one underaged John Galen McKinley, aka. Jack McKinley who dropped out of high school and ran away from home in the rural Maryland to the big city when he was only 16 years old. It was Tom O'Horgan with whom young and handsome McKinley found not just lodging but also homosexual love after arriving alone and virtually broke in New York's Greenwich Village. The 16 year old lived with O'Horgan only for a few weeks, when he met the famous Harvey Milk and moved into his apartment only 3 weeks later to begin a brand new homosexual love affair. O'Horgan and Jack McKinley got together multiple times later in life. It was before Tom O'Horgan even set foot on Broadway and just started producing experimental plays in his Lower East Side loft and at Ellen Steuart's emerging Cafe La Mama, that McKinley was tending to the technical aspect of theater and learning the basics of stage managing. Harvey Milk would occasionally loan some money to Tom O'Horgan to encourage him to be more ambitious and take on a major production. At that time O'Horgan, McKinley, and Harvey Milk became an indivisible trio: the teenaged high school dropout, the avant-garde director, and a Wall Street businessman. By the time Tom's first Broadway musical \\"Hair\\" was being produced, Jack was hired as stage manager for the show, as well as other famous shows of Tom O'Horgan played from New York to California, including the world renowned and controversial \\"Jesus Christ Superstar\\". In his later years O'Horgan suffered from Alzheimer's disease. The disease began to show signs in 2002 and by 2007 he was deeply in debt and unable to care for himself.Tom O'Horgan, MasterworksBroadway.com, accessed June 7, 2015. He came under the care of friends Marc and Julia Cohen, his loft and collections of instruments were sold, and he moved to Venice, Florida, where he died on January 11, 2009. A small group of close friends scattered his ashes in San Francisco Bay, where they had scattered the ashes of his lifelong friends Harvey Milk and Galen McKinley years before. He was 84 years old.

This was Herbert's first novel and included graphic depictions of death and mutilation. A film adaptation was made in 1982, called Deadly Eyes. A 1985 adventure game for the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum based on the book was published by Hodder & Stoughton Ltd and produced by GXT (Five Ways Software). The Rats was followed by three sequels, Lair (1979), Domain (1984) and The City (1993) (the last one was a graphic novel). All three books were sold as a trilogy and were very well received by the public and horror fans. Background Herbert became inspired to write The Rats in early 1972, whilst watching Tod Browning's Dracula; specifically, after seeing the scene where Renfield describes a nightmare he had involving hordes of rats. Linking the film to childhood memories he had of rats in the London suburbs, Herbert stated in later interviews that he wrote the book primarily as a pastime; \\"It seemed like a good idea at the time, I was as naive as that.\\" The manuscript was typed by Herbert's wife Eileen, who sent it off after nine months to nine different publishers. Plot The novel opens by introducing the reader to an alcoholic vagrant, resting in an abandoned and forgotten lock-keeper's house by a canal. As he is ruminating over the injustices inflicted upon him in his life, he is suddenly set upon by a pack of small dog-sized black rats and is devoured alive. Harris, a young East London art teacher, notices that one of his students has a bloodied bandage around his hand. When he enquires as to what caused the damage, the student answers that he was attacked by a rat. Meanwhile, a baby girl and her dog are killed by the giant rats, now aided by packs of smaller black rats. The girl's mother rescues her daughter's mutilated body, but not before sustaining bites as well. Harris takes the student to the hospital and sees the grieving mother with her dead child. According to the doctor, the number of seemingly unprovoked rat attacks have strangely increased. The next rat attack occurs at the remains of a bombsite, where a group of squabbling vagrants are slaughtered. Harris is visited at work by the Minister of Health, Mr. Foskins, who reveals that the bitten student, and all the other surviving victims of rat attacks, died of a mysterious disease 24 hours after being bitten. Foskins asks Harris to keep the existence of the disease a secret and lead an exterminator named Ferris to the area where the student had been bitten. Accompanied by Ferris, Harris goes to the canal described by the student and sights a group of giant rats. Harris attempts to contact the police, while Ferris follows the rats, who then attack and kill him. The rat attacks become increasingly more daring, as more and more public places are attacked. A tube station is assaulted, leaving few survivors. Next, Harris' own school is attacked, resulting in the death of the headmaster. With the existence of the rats' disease now becoming public knowledge, a meeting is held, in which a young researcher by the name of Stephen Howard comes up with the idea of using a virus to infect the rats. The virus is injected into several puppies, which are left in areas of the attacks. This results in the deaths of thousands of rats, which crawl to the surface to die. A few weeks later however, the rats adapt to the virus, at the same time losing the toxicity of their bites. The rats brutally attack a cinema and overrun the London Zoo. Based on the fact that rats communicate with each other using ultrasound, a plan is formulated to use ultrasonic machines to lure the rats into poison gas chambers. Foskins is dismissed as Health Minister and reveals to Harris that he has been investigating possible clues as to the rats' origins and comes to the conclusion that they were illegally smuggled into the country by a zoologist named William Bartlett Schiller from an island near New Guinea which had been near some nuclear tests. At his home by an East London canal, Schiller had bred these mutant rats with common black rats, producing a new and deadly strain. They later killed him and escaped. Pursuing the disgraced health minister past waves of entranced rats, Harris finds the abandoned house and enters it. He goes into the cellar and finds Foskins' corpse being devoured by rats of unusually great size. He kills them after a bloody battle and discovers the rats' alpha hidden in the shadows; a white, hairless and obese rat with two heads. Harris kills the creature and leaves. The epilogue indicates that one female rat survived the purge by being trapped in the basement of a grocery shop. There, it gives birth to a new litter, including a new white two-headed rat. Critical reception The first paperback edition sold out after three weeks. The Rats received harsh criticism upon its publication. It was deemed to be far too graphic in its portrayals of death and mutilation, and the social commentary regarding the neglect of London's suburbs was said to be too extreme.Campbell, Ramsey, \\"James Herbert\\", in Joshi, S.T. (ed.) Ramsey Campbell, Probably. Hornsea, Drugstore Indian Press, (pp. 272-73) For some reviewers, the novel was not literature, and not a good example of good writing. However, many consider the novel to be social commentary influenced by Herbert's harsh upbringing in immediate post-war London. Ramsey Campbell lauded the novel, saying \\"The Rats announces at once that he (Herbert) won't be confined by the conventions of English macabre fiction.\\" Campbell praised the use of the theme of \\"Original Sin\\" in The Rats, saying \\"that the book can discuss its underlying themes so directly without becoming pretentious...is one of Herbert's strengths.\\" Campbell also defended Herbert's use of violence and indigence as both integral to The Rats' plot, and a break from the clichés of the horror fiction of that time period. The underlying theme of the novel is the lack of care by the government toward the underclass and a lack of reaction to a tragedy until it is too late. Fellow author Peter James stated \\"I think Jim reinvented the horror genre and brought it into the modern world. He set a benchmark with his writing that many writers subsequently have tried, without success, to emulate.\\" References 1974 British novels 1974 science fiction novels Novels by James Herbert British horror novels Fictional mice and rats Novels set in London Novels about animals British novels adapted into films 1974 debut novels ","title":"The Rats (novel)"},{"id":"9596391","title":"Welsh heraldry"},{"id":"9596398","text":"Tamarindo is the Spanish word for a tamarind.

It can be used in groups of many sizes, who want to make their decision quickly, as by a vote, but want everyone's opinions taken into account (as opposed to traditional voting, where only the largest group is considered). The method of tallying is the difference. First, every member of the group gives their view of the solution, with a short explanation. Then, duplicate solutions are eliminated from the list of all solutions, and the members proceed to rank the solutions, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and so on. Some facilitators will encourage the sharing and discussion of reasons for the choices made by each group member, thereby identifying common ground, and a plurality of ideas and approaches. This diversity often allows the creation of a hybrid idea (combining parts of two or more ideas), often found to be even better than those ideas being initially considered. In the basic method, the numbers each solution receives are totaled, and the solution with the highest (i.e. most favored) total ranking is selected as the final decision. There are variations on how this technique is used. For example, it can identify strengths versus areas in need of development, rather than be used as a decision-making voting alternative. Also, options do not always have to be ranked, but may be evaluated more subjectively. This technique was originally developed by Andre Delbecq and Andrew H. Van de Ven,Delbecq A. L., VandeVen A. H., and Gustafson D. H., (1975). \\"Group techniques for program planning : a guide to nominal group and Delphi processes\\", Glenview, Illinois: Scott Foresman and Company. and has been applied to adult education program planning by Vedros,Vedros K. R., (1979). \\"The Nominal Group Technique is a Participatory, Planning Method In Adult Education\\", Ph.D. dissertation, Florida State University, Tallahassee. and has also been employed as a useful technique in curriculum design and evaluation in educational institutions. Taking cue from the technique, Tunde Varga-Atkins, Jaye McIsaac and Ian Willis, found that a two-stage combination of focus group and the nominal group technique, coined as nominal focus group, was particularly effective as an evaluation method. Effects NGT have been shown to enhance one or more dimensions of effectiveness of decision-making groups. Requiring individuals to write down their ideas silently and independently prior to a group discussion increased the number of solutions generated by groups. Round-robin polling also resulted in a larger number of inputs and fostered more equal participation. The increased number of heterogeneous inputs led to high quality decisions. As compared to interacting groups the NGT groups provide more unique ideas, more balanced participation between group members, increased feelings of accomplishment, and greater satisfaction with idea quality and group efficiency. These findings are consistent with a 1958 study which found that, in response to three different problems requiring creative thinking, the number of ideas produced by \\"nominal groups\\" (whose members were actually working alone) was greater than the number of ideas produced by real, face-to-face groups. The ideas generated by the nominal and real groups were rated qualitatively and for originality, and the nominal groups scored better on both of those measures. Usage The nominal group technique is particularly useful: * When some group members are much more vocal than others. * When some group members think better in silence. * When there is concern about some members not participating. * When the group does not easily generate quantities of ideas. * When all or some group members are new to the team. * When the issue is controversial or there is heated conflict. * When there is a power-imbalance between facilitator and participants or participants: the structure of the NGT session can balance these out. * When stakeholders like a(/some) quantitative output of the process. Standard procedure Routinely, the NGT involves five stages: # Introduction and explanation: The facilitator welcomes the participants and explains to them the purpose and procedure of the meeting. # Silent generation of ideas: The Facilitator provides each participant with a sheet of paper with the question to be addressed and ask them to write down all ideas that come to mind when considering the question. During this period, the facilitator asks participants not to consult or discuss their ideas with others. This stage lasts approximately 10 minutes. # Sharing ideas: The Facilitator invites participants to share the ideas they have generated. She records each idea on a flip chart using the words spoken by the participant. The round robin process continues until all ideas have been presented. There is no debate about items at this stage and participants are encouraged to write down any new ideas that may arise from what others share. This process ensures all participants get an opportunity to make an equal contribution and provides a written record of all ideas generated by the group. This stage may take 15–30 minutes. # Group discussion: Participants are invited to seek verbal explanation or further details about any of the ideas that colleagues have produced that may not be clear to them. The facilitator’s task is to ensure that each person is allowed to contribute and that discussion of all ideas is thorough without spending too long on a single idea. It is important to ensure that the process is as neutral as possible, avoiding judgment and criticism. The group may suggest new items for discussion and combine items into categories, but no ideas should be eliminated. This stage lasts 30–45 minutes. # Voting and ranking: This involves prioritizing the recorded ideas in relation to the original question. Following the voting and ranking process, immediate results in response to the question is available to participants so the meeting concludes having reached a specific outcome. The number of nominal group meetings to be held will depend on the nature of the question and accessibility to the key stakeholders best suited to help address the problem. Advantages and disadvantages One major advantage of NGT is that it avoids two problems caused by group interaction. First, some members are reluctant to suggest ideas because they are concerned about being criticized, or are reticent and shy. Second, some members are reluctant to create conflict in groups. (Many people want to maintain a pleasant climate.) NGT overcomes these problems (e.g.). NGT has the clear advantage in ensuring relatively equal participation. It may also, in many cases be a time-saving technique. Other advantages include producing a large number of ideas and providing a sense of closure that is often not found in less-structured group methods. A major disadvantage of NGT is that the method lacks flexibility by being able to deal with only one problem at a time. Also, there must be a certain amount of conformity on the part of the members involved in NGT. Everyone must feel comfortable with the amount of structure involved. Another disadvantage is the amount of time needed to prepare for the activity. There is no spontaneity involved with this method. Facilities must be arranged and carefully planned. Opinions may not converge in the voting process, cross-fertilization of ideas may be constrained, and the process may appear to be too mechanical. One of the key issues about 'nominal' group technique is that it does not depend on normal group processes. It is a method to work with a collection of people and involve them in decision making but does not depend on existing group processes. This is according to the originators an advantage in decision making using this tool. Adaptation for ill-structured problems Modification of NGT, undertaken by Bartunek and Murnighan, helps to deal with ill-structured problems. Normal ideas are generated and listed, followed by the facilitator questioning if the ideas are relevant to the same problem. If not, the problem is said to be ill-structured, and the ideas generated are clustered into coherent groups. These clusters of ill-structured ideas are then treated as problems in their own right, and the NGT procedure is applied to them. Regular breaks are taken by the participants to ensure that the group feels they are still working on the original problem.

It was founded in 1973 by businesswoman, lawyer, feminist and activist Edessa Rose. The Rose Institute is particularly well known for its expertise on elections, demographic, fiscal and public policy analysis. History In 1973, businesswoman and lawyer, feminist and activist Edessa Rose founded the Rose Institute of State and Local Government as a part of Claremont McKenna College to address issues specific to California’s state and local governments. In its early period (1973-1990), the Rose Institute developed the nation’s first comprehensive statewide demographic and political database. Faculty, staff, and students worked together to match California’s 50,000 precincts to its 5,000-plus census tracts, following the political and demographic trends in the State. In 1979, the California Business Roundtable gave a million dollar grant to fund a significant redistricting reform and education program at the Institute. From the start, the Institute committed itself to conducting research with faculty-student teams. Over the years, more than 300 students of Claremont McKenna College, Claremont Graduate University and the other Claremont Colleges have worked in the Rose Institute. Students have contributed significantly to the Institute’s survey research programs, providing high-quality interviewing services, assisting in data presentation, and often playing key roles in analysis. Today, all Rose Institute students are trained in GIS, survey research, fiscal analysis, and legal and regulatory analysis. In 2010, the Rose Institute partnered with the Lowe Institute for Political Economy to establish the Inland Empire Center. Before the partnership, there was very little political and economic analysis of the region, despite the Inland Empire ranking as the 14th largest metropolitan statistical area (MSA) in the United States at the time. Recognizing the significance of the region to California’s economy, the two institutes – both based at Claremont McKenna College – saw the need for an organization that could deliver analysis on current issues impacting the Inland Empire. In 2014, the institute's founding director and former CMC Dean of Faculty, David Alan Heslop, was sentenced to 21 months in federal prison after pleading guilty to one count of felony conspiracy to commit bribery for his role in a kickback scheme that bilked the Twentynine Palms Band of Mission Indians out of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Projects For both public and private clients, the Institute: performs economic impact studies with the goal of clarifying the budgetary impact of particular policy proposals; handles survey projects from start to finish, designing the questionnaire, collecting the data, and assessing the policy implications; and works with cities, counties, and other entities to evaluate present policy and recommend future fiscal and policy changes. These projects have addressed a range of topics, including tribal sovereignty, transportation, housing, and water quality and availability. In one recent project, Rose Institute researchers conducted a comparative analysis of public services in California’s largest counties for Voice of San Diego, a prominent online news organization. The Institute also conducts research on legal and constitutional issues, such as the impact of a full-time legislature and the history of initiatives in California and other states, resulting in the Miller-Rose Institute Initiative Database—the most complete online database of voter-approved statewide ballot initiatives: [roseinstitute.org/initiatives].  Miller-Rose Initiative Database  The Miller-Rose Initiative Database summarizes original research on statewide ballot initiatives throughout the United States from post-election legal challenges to initiatives. The result is a legal resource available complete with expert analysis on the implications for California politics.  California Almanac  The California Almanac is a resource for California residents to learn more about their local elected officials and discover their own cities. Information included ranges from demographic statistics to contact information for elected officials.  Redistricting in America  Redistricting in America is the crowning achievement of the Rose Institute following the 2010 census, keeping Americans up-to-date on the effects of redistricting and gerrymandering. Students and staff work to provide in-depth analysis on the legal and social implications of redistricting, as well as providing descriptions on each state’s mechanisms for redrawing Congressional lines.  Inland Empire Center aka Inland Empire Vision  The Inland Empire Center is the Rose Institute’s partnership with the Lowe Institute for Political Economy, in conducting the annual economic forecast conferences held in Southern California, initially with the help of the UCLA Anderson School of Management. The Inland Empire Center also partners with the Rose Institute to publish the Inland Empire Outlook.  Inland Empire Outlook  The Inland Empire Outlook is a biannual publication of the Rose Institute that focuses on the economic and political analysis of the Inland Empire and its surrounding communities. The articles are carefully researched and written by undergraduate research assistants under the strict supervision of a senior staff or faculty affiliate of the Institute.  Kosmont-Rose Institute Cost of Doing Business Survey  A Kosmont-Rose Survey for local governments and businesses across America to investigate the costs of doing business in their locales.  Video Voter Series  One of the newest of the Rose Institute’s projects, Video Voter is a resource in which voters can find information about upcoming votes on California initiatives. The result is a consolidated source of information that serve as a one-stop shop for voters with questions about initiatives on the ballot.  Southern California Policy Analysis  While the Rose Institute analyzes state and local government policies throughout California and the nation, it places special emphasis on Southern California. The Rose Institute conducts fiscal, regulatory, and survey analysis for counties, municipal governments, Native American tribal governments, news organizations, and other businesses across Southern California—from Los Angeles and Orange County to the Inland Empire and San Diego. Through this work, the Rose has developed a sophisticated understanding of this dynamic region’s diverse political and economic institutions. In a joint venture with the Lowe Institute of Political Economy, the Rose Institute recently launched the Inland Empire Center for Economics and Public Policy. The Inland Empire is one of the fastest growing places in the United States and now has a larger population than 24 states. The Center publishes Inland Empire Outlook, an economic and political newsletter, and has created new indices that will become leading measures of the Inland Empire’s economic activity. These indices, along with specialized public policy analysis and modeling, will be published regularly in print and online, and presented at conferences in the Inland Empire hosted jointly with the UCLA Anderson Forecast.  Other Ongoing Projects  Especially noteworthy contracts in the Institute’s recent history include: research on representation conducted for the California Roundtable; work on juvenile justice codes performed by Professor Ralph Rossum for the US Department of Justice; fiscal analyses of Orange, Los Angeles, Riverside and Monterey Counties by Dr. Steven B. Frates; an atlas of South Central Los Angeles created for the Ford Foundation in the wake of the Watts riots; and survey and data work for the San Gabriel Valley Economic Partnership and the San Fernando Economic Alliance.

It is found around the coasts of New Zealand, the Chatham Islands, and in south-eastern parts of Australia. Individuals from shallow waters, deep, have a carapace width of only , while those from are wide. Identification At first glance, Ovalipes catharus appear to be fairly similar to many other crabs. Paddle crabs have a hard shell, or carapace and ten legs, five to each side. The first set of legs of the crab is tipped with large claws. The claws of the paddle crab are fairly long and narrow and are curled in a sickle shape.McLaughlin, P. (1980). Comparative morphology of recent crustace. W.H. Freeman and Company. First Edition. pp. 126–128 They are decapods which means they have 10 legs and are situated symmetrically with five legs on each side. The claws are also serrated with large points on the insides.Wilkens S., S. Ahyong. (2015). Coastal crabs: a guide to the crabs of New Zealand. NIWA: Taihoro Nukurangi. Version 1. pp. 3–5, 43. The carapace, or shell, of the crab can range from pale orange to light gray, and can be spotted with brown and red. The carapace is a rough oval shape, and the front end has five teeth to either side of the eyes. Paddle crabs can reach sizes ranging from 100–140 mm across the shell upon reaching maturity. Unlike some other crab species, the last pair of legs of this crab is flattened into a paddle, hence their name. These paddles are also colored blue, and sometimes have a purple tinge, making them distinctive in color from the rest of the body. Unlike prawns and lobsters which have narrow bodies with long tails, paddle crabs have also developed a wide body (carapace) and very short tail (abdomen), which is usually tucked underneath to its body making it compact and wide. Geographic distribution and habitat Paddle crab (O. catharus) found to be quite a unique species to which is native to New Zealand and Australia. Paddle crabs are often active swimmers, but if they are not active, they normally bury themselves underneath the sand. There are hundreds of species worldwide, showing that they are common throughout New Zealand, and species found in different areas have turned up in New Zealand, mainly in warmer waters to the North, and have made themselves at home when they invade either naturally or accidentally by ship. Ships need to pump water to keep them balanced, however many marine species like paddle crabs have tiny larvae in their life cycle, where they might get sucked into ballast tanks and get pumped out again when the ship reaches a destination. If they survive, the larvae would grow to become an adult in its new home. According to all records in 2003 from the ‘Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries’ Ovalipes catharus were locally found on open sandy beaches, in surf areas and open coast. Adults are relatively distributed throughout mainland New Zealand, Stewart Island and Chatham Island from intertidal to more than 10 meters with size maturity varies geographically, i.e., those from the Tasman Bay maturing smaller with carapace 50mm width, compared to those from the Pegasus Bay, 65mm.Bradford, E. (1998). \\"Harvest estimates from the 1996 national marine recreational surveys\\". New Zealand Fisheries Assessment Research Document 98/16 However, fishery reports of this species from Stewart Island were thought to be misidentified as Nectocarcinus spp.Osborne, T.A.

University of Canterbury. pp. 4–12 and so, research bottom trawl records (trawl database) and some other electronic databases, recRamp, CELR, AllSeaBio database were created to record all crabs of this type (i.e., O.catharus) with at least 55mm carapace width taken to be the minimum adult size.Ministry for Primary Industries, New Zealand National Aquatic Biodiversity Information System, 2012 Therefore, analysis will provide specific database for ‘Seafood New Zealand’ and for estimate distribution of the species throughout New Zealand Coastal regions. Diet, prey and predators= Diet and foraging  Paddle crabs consume a wide variety of organisms. Much of their diet is made up of mollusks and crustaceans, but they have also been observed catching and eating fish as well. Crabs have been found to consume vegetative tissues that they find while they are foraging in the sediment. Cannibalism of smaller crabs occurs as well, especially in the winter when other food sources are more limited. Some larger crabs are also cannibalized as well, especially if they have recently moulted, and are lacking the hard outer shell. Paddle crabs hunt in several ways. The crabs spend much of their time scavenging for food in the sediment layers, but will also actively hunt fish, shrimp and other creatures. The flattened hind legs of the crab allow them to swim rapidly, which aid them in catching faster prey. These paddles also allow the crabs swim in water up to 10 meters deep, giving them a larger hunting range than other crab species that can be limited to shallow water. The crab’s claws are also extremely important for their success in hunting. Not only can they be used to catch fish, but the claws are extremely important for accessing other prey as well. These crabs are very good at harvesting mussels and other bivalves, In order to get to the soft flesh inside, the paddle crab can either pry the shell of the mussels open with its claws, or in the case of smaller mussels, the crab’s claws are strong enough to crush the shell.Davidson, R. (1987). Natural food and predatory activity of the paddle crab, Ovalipes catharus: A flexible forager. Unpublished PhD thesis, University of Canterbury. pp. 2–15. With all of these tools at its disposal, the paddle crab is one of the more dominant predators of the intertidal zone.  Predators, parasites, and diseases  Large fish such as dogfish and snapper make up the majority of the predators that usually prey upon Ovalipes catharus. Along with these predatory fish, larger crabs can also cannibalize younger paddle crabs. When it comes to parasites, nematodes and bryozoans are the main groups that parasitize these crabs. These parasites reach the highest density on mature crabs that no longer moult. However, the type and intensity of parasitism can differ depending on the setting that the crab is living. In a study looking at the crossing over of parasites between native and invasive crabs, it appears that Ovalipes catharus has not been affected by new parasites brought by invasive species. Since paddle crabs come in contact with an invasive species of crab, Charybdis japonica, they risk being exposed to new parasites brought by the invasive species that they have little to no resistance to. However, in the study when comparing crabs caught in the same site, there were no similar parasites between the species. Life cycle and phenology Paddle crabs usually mate sometime between May and November. This time is variable from colony to colony. The temperature and abundance of food are two of the factors that affect the timing that spawning occur. In a colony, spawning can either be synchronized, or can be spread out throughout the entire breeding season. In order to breed, the female crab must be soft shelled, which also plays a role in the variety of spawning times. Once the crabs have spawned, the female incubates the eggs until they hatch. After the eggs hatch, the newborn crabs emerge in their first larval phase. Paddle crabs go through eight zoea phases, which all occurs in deeper water offshore. Once the zoea phase is complete the young paddle crabs entire the megalopa phase, which usually occurs between January and May. After this final larval stage is complete, the crabs will continue to grow through moulting. Unlike the moulting that occurred in the larval stage, moulting as an adult doesn’t change the morphology of the crab, it simply lets it reach a larger size. After roughly 10–13 moults the crab will reach maturity. This usually takes 3–4 years, but when food is limited it can take longer to reach maturity. The time it takes for a crab to mature can also be affected by the environment: crabs living in warmer waters grow faster and breed more often than crabs in cooler conditions. Other information Paddle crabs have a reputation for being very aggressive and are known to pinch swimmers on occasion. It can be fairly easy to come in contact with the crabs, since their preferences for sandy beaches put them into a similar area as many vacationers. The population of paddle crabs is believed to be increasing in recent years as their predator numbers decrease due to over-fishing. However, formal studies haven’t been done to quantify the crab’s population over time, so much of the evidence is merely opinion based. Paddle crabs have caught in large numbers and sold commercially in recent years. With much of the catch occurring off the course of the North Island, paddle crab has become increasing important economically. However, since the exact population isn’t known, there is some worries that overfishing could occur. Also, the non- commercial catch isn’t known either, which also could also have a long-term effect on the sustainability of the paddle crab harvest. Since much of the paddle crab habitat is close to shore, they are fairly easy for recreational fishermen to catch. The paddle crab is known for having meat with both good flavor and texture, which contributes to a large amount of its market success. Ovalipes catharus has also been observed to be highly migratory in an experiment that tagged a number of crabs. This means that populations in New Zealand aren’t likely to be genetically diverse.

It is part of the suite of defence force service awards introduced in 1982, which also included the Defence Force Service Medal (DFSM, for all members of the permanent forces) and the Reserve Force Medal (RFM, for non-commissioned members of the Reserve forces). However, the RFD is the only one of the three to carry a postnominal entitlement. All three medals were replaced in 2002 with a single medal, the Defence Long Service Medal, which is now awarded to all permanent and reserve members irrespective of rank. Additional service clasps, each indicating a further 5 years after the initial 15 year qualifying service, can still be issued to persons awarded the RFD, RFM or DFSM. The first four clasps to the medal are indicated by rosettes. These are replaced by a single silver Federation Star for the fifth clasp. Additional Federation Star emblems are added for subsequent clasps. Other Australian Long Service Awards include: * Defence Force Service Medal * Reserve Force Medal * Defence Long Service Medal (currently awarded) * National Medal * Australian Cadet Forces Service Medal While the Australian Defence Medal is sometimes classified as a \\"long service medal\\", it is intended to recognise all those who completed an obligation to serve their country (whether voluntarily or conscripted), and is not awarded for \\"long service\\" per se. Description * The RFD is an oval cupro-nickel medal surrounded by a gilt wreath of wattle, ensigned with the Crown of Saint Edward. The obverse has the Joint Service Emblem on a rayed background. * The reverse is inscribed 'FOR EFFICIENT SERVICE IN THE RESERVE FORCES'. * The 32mm-wide ribbon has three equal stripes of azure-blue and gold.

On the 17 February, the captain of the ship radioed that there was a \\"chemical reaction\\" in the ship's cargo, leading him to stop engines. The vessel was near the port of A Coruña. The Spanish authorities sent a support team to look at the ship but nothing wrong was detected and the Ostedijk was allowed to continue her voyage to Valencia. A day later, the captain radioed again that the chemical reaction in the cargo was continuing and that white smoke was coming out of # 2 section of the cargo hold. The Spanish authorities then towed the ship away from the coast and began consultation with technical experts. Specialists were sent to the vessel, they took measurements with infrared cameras, estimating that the top of the fertilizer had reached about 200 °C. As time went by and no action was taken, the plume continued to grow. On the morning of the 20th, a nearby tugboat started throwing water over the ship's cover to cool down the cargo but the effect was negligible. Land personnel were sent aboard the ship to open the cargo containers on the 21st. As the cargo was aired, the smoke plume grew - in a matter of minutes it was about 10 meters in diameter and several hundred meters in length. On the 22nd, three special pipes/spears were inserted into the cargo and delivered water. The fire decayed over the following few days and by 1 March the fire was declared extinguished. Ostedijk was sent to the nearby port of Bilbao to unload the cargo. The status of the current official investigation is unknown. However, this kind of incident is a well-known hazard with some types of NPK fertilizers, and is responsible for the loss of several cargo ships and chemical plants, (see examples in Ammonium nitrate disasters). Large stockpiles of the material can be a major fire risk due to their supporting oxidation, it may also detonate. Ammonium nitrate (AN), a common element in inorganic fertilizers like NPKs, exothermically decomposes into gases when heated to temperatures above 210 °C. The reaction can become self-sustaining (known as self-sustaining decomposition, or SSD), which is a thermal runaway (i.e. a fire event with a chemistry not based on oxygen consumption). Analysis of plume images carried out at The University of Edinburgh shows a rapidly growing fire and gives an estimate of the evolution of the cargo mass loss rate, ranging from approximately 0.5 kg/s the first day to 12 kg/s on the last day. Aided by small-scale experiments with NPK samples, the study estimated that the power of the event was in the order of 6-30 MW on day five.

The cemetery has been designated a conservation area by Wirral Borough Council, which owns the site. History Originally planned in the 1840s, Joseph Paxton was approached to design a large municipal cemetery for the expanding township of Birkenhead, but due to a recession and a subsequent decrease in the population, the plan went no further. By the 1860s, a boom made the provision of a new cemetery a priority. A competition was held for the design which was won by Edward Kemp, a pupil of Paxton's and Curator of Birkenhead Park. Kemp was assisted by Edward Mills, a prominent Birkenhead surveyor from Hamilton Square, and Messrs Lucy and Littler, architects of Liverpool. The general contractor was William Rimmer of Bidston Hall, with John Miller of St. Helens the contractor for buildings. The site chosen was Flaybrick Hill, a prominent location overlooked by Bidston Hill. Originally were purchased, but by the 1890s the site was extended to . The cemetery was officially opened 30 May 1864 and named Birkenhead Cemetery, and the site originally had three separate denominational chapels. The Roman Catholic chapel was demolished in 1971 and a memorial wall has been erected on its site. The remaining two chapels, for Nonconformists and the Church of England, were last used in 1975. Most of the buildings are now in a considerable state of dereliction. The Registrar's office and Sexton's Lodge are now privately owned. The cemetery contains the war graves of 219 Commonwealth service personnel of both World Wars. Other interments include James Taylor Cochran, who built the Resurgam, Sir William Jackson, Arthur Thomas Doodson, Mary Ann Mercer and Isaac Roberts. Conservation area The cemetery was designated as a conservation area in 1990. In 1995, Flaybrick Cemetery was renamed Flaybrick Memorial Gardens and an arboretum was created.

The MLUs were simple radio beacons, and thus required search and rescuers to use traditional radio direction finding (RDF or DF) equipment to obtain a bearing, but not a precise location, to the beacon. Unique to Mount Hood, these devices could be rented for $5 at Portland-area outdoor shops and the Inn, open 24 hours a day. The units were available from the late 1980s until 2017, but advances in technology now provide superior locating information by devices such as a PLB, InReach or Spot. Groups scaling Mount Hood are recommended to carry an emergency signaling device and all climbers must register before climbing and sign out upon return. The MLU was designed after a school group with two adults and seven children perished on Mount Hood in 1986. (See Mount Hood climbing accidents.) The bodies of some of the group were found in a snow cave a day after the searchers had passed within fifteen feet of their shelter without noticing them. According to Steve Rollins of Portland Mountain Rescue, the units could be worn on a sash across the chest and were relatively light. Renting MLU's was less expensive than either purchasing or renting a personal locator beacon, which typically cost several hundred dollars to buy, or rent from various sources for around $50 per week. The Mount Hood MLU system was controlled and maintained by the U.S. Forest Service and Clackamas County Sheriff. Transmitters broadcast at 168.54 MHz and provided good signals even when buried in snow. They could be received at up to , though the signal travels in line of sight, so they could not be received from behind a ridge or deep in a canyon. The technology iasvery similar to wildlife tracking systems. A Mountain Locator Unit only transmitted a signal and did not initiate a rescue (when you activated an MLU beacon, there was no one monitoring for signals, the device only assisted rescuers in locating lost climbers once a rescue has been requested by other means and rescuers know to listen and search for the beacon's signal. They were also not designed to be used for avalanche safety (avalanche beacons are entirely different than what MLU's were designed for.) The use of MLU Beacon technology was overtaken by availability of Personal Locator Beacons (PLBs) and other technologies such as \\"SPOT Satellite GPS Messengers\\". These newer technologies not only allow rescuers to determine your location, but they also have the ability to initiate a rescue by alerting authorities that you are in need of help. In fact, most modern cell phones have built in GPS receivers. If a climber calls 911, the cell phone may automatically provide emergency services with the climber's GPS coordinates. Cell phones also allow the lost or injured climber to provide important information to rescuers, such as the nature of any injuries; however, cell phone coverage on Mount Hood can be spotty and they are therefore not necessarily a replacement for other technologies such as PLBs which leverage satellites overhead for communication. Oregon State Representative John Lim (R) introduced House Bill 2509, which would require climbers to use an electronic signaling device when climbing above 10,000 feet between November and March. The Oregon House of Representatives passed an amended versionA-Engrossed House Bill 2509 of the bill 33 to 22 on March 28, 2007 after a lengthy floor debate and passed it onto the Oregon State Senate where it died in committee.2007 Oregon House Measure History The bill was widely opposed by mountain rescue organizations for fear that it would cause inexperienced climbers to rely on rescuers to save them rather than learning to become self-reliant.

Once when she was traveling towards Hyderabad in the train, she stops the train for her fallen lipstick, which leads to the death of Parvathamma (Dubbing Janaki). Raju (Venkatesh) is the Coolie No. 1 at Secunderabad Railway Station. He and Ranjani always have so many clashes between each other. Rajani calls her father from Singapore, and both of them implicate Raju in a rape case and send him to jail. However, Raju is successful in escaping from jail. Due to Raju's threat, Koteswara Rao and Ranjani go to Singapore. Raju also reaches there with the help of Ranjani's mother Gruhalakshmi (Sarada). Raju changes himself as Bharat and showcases himself as a big shot before Ranjani and makes her fall in love with him. Everyone agrees to their marriage, but Buchi Babu (Paruchuri Venkateswara Rao), Koteswara Rao's partner, and his son Gopal (Mohan Babu), who wants to marry Ranjani, find out that Bharat is none other than Raju. After the marriage completion, Raju reveals the truth. Everyone is shocked, Ranjani is disturbed, and she also throws away the holy Hindu wedding chain (Mangalsutra). After that, everyone goes back to India, where Raju arranges their marriage reception. To overcome this problem, Koteswara Rao contacts local goon named Ranga Rao (Kota Srinivasa Rao) to stop the reception. He creates a big communal riot in Raju's colony, which leads to the deaths of many innocent people. In frustration and anger, Raju makes Ranjani pregnant by giving her sedation with her mother's help. She makes all possible attempts to remove the baby but fails. Finally, she decides to throw away the baby after giving birth. Meanwhile, Ranga Rao, Buchi Babu, and Gopal try to kill Koteswara Rao for his property, but Raju protects him, which makes him realize. Ranjani gives birth to the baby boy; even then she will not leave her arrogance, and throws away the child. Raju decides to leave her, and her fate goes away with the baby. In that anger, Gruhalakshmi reveals Ranjani's past that she is not their own daughter, but the daughter of a railway coolie, and the woman who died in the beginning due to her negligence is her own mother. Listening to this, Ranjani admits her mistake. At the same time, Ranga Rao, Buchi Babu, and Gopal all beat Raju very badly, kidnap the baby, and blackmail Ranjani for her entire property documents. Ranjani runs towards Raju's help and apologises to him by falling down at his feet. Finally, Raju protects the baby and eliminates all the baddies. The movie ends with Raju and Ranjani's remarriage.

A holographic image can be generated e.g. by digitally computing a holographic interference pattern and printing it onto a mask or film for subsequent illumination by suitable coherent light source. Alternatively, the holographic image can be brought to life by a holographic 3D display (a display which operates on the basis of interference of coherent light), bypassing the need of having to fabricate a \\"hardcopy\\" of the holographic interference pattern each time. Consequently, in recent times the term \\"computer-generated holography\\" is increasingly being used to denote the whole process chain of synthetically preparing holographic light wavefronts suitable for observation. Computer-generated holograms have the advantage that the objects which one wants to show do not have to possess any physical reality at all (completely synthetic hologram generation). On the other hand, if holographic data of existing objects is generated optically, but digitally recorded and processed, and brought to display subsequently, this is termed CGH as well. Ultimately, computer-generated holography might serve all the roles of current computer-generated imagery: holographic computer displays for a wide range of applications from CAD to gaming, holographic video and TV programs, automotive and communication applications (cell phone displays) and many more.  Overview  Holography is a technique originally invented by Hungarian physicist Dennis Gabor (1900-1979) to improve the resolving power on electron microscopes. An object is illuminated with a coherent (usually monochromatic) light beam; the scattered light is brought to interference with a reference beam of the same source, recording the interference pattern. CGH as defined in the introduction has broadly three tasks: # Computation of the virtual scattered wavefront # Encoding the wavefront data, preparing it for display # Reconstruction: Modulating the interference pattern onto a coherent light beam by technological means, to transport it to the user observing the hologram. Note that it is not always justified to make a strict distinction between these steps; however it helps the discussion to structure it in this way.  Wavefront computation  Computer generated holograms offer important advantages over the optical holograms since there is no need for a real object. Because of this breakthrough, a three-dimensional display was expected when the first algorithms were reported at 1966. Unfortunately, the researchers soon realized that there are noticeable lower and upper bounds in terms of computational speed and image quality and fidelity respectively. Wavefront calculations are computationally very intensive; even with modern mathematical techniques and high-end computing equipment, real-time computation is tricky. There are many different methods for calculating the interference pattern for a CGH. In the following 25 years a lot of methods for CGHs were proposed in the fields of holographic information and computational reduction as well as in computational and quantization techniques. In the field of computational techniques the reported algorithms can be categorized in two main concepts.  Fourier transform method  In the first one, the Fourier transformation is used to simulate the propagation of each plane of depth of the object to the hologram plane. The Fourier transformation concept was first introduced by Brown and Lohmann with the detour phase method leading to cell oriented holograms. A coding technique suggested by Burch replaced the cell oriented holograms by point holograms and made this kind of computer generated holograms more attractive. In a Fourier Transform hologram the reconstruction of the image occurs in the far field. This is usually achieved by using the Fourier transforming properties of a positive lens for reconstruction. So there are two steps in this process: computing the light field in the far observer plane, and then Fourier transforming this field back to the lens plane. These holograms are called Fourier Based Holograms. First CGHs based on the Fourier transform could reconstruct only 2D images. Brown and Lohmann introduced a technique to calculate computer generated holograms of 3D objects. Calculation of the light propagation from three-dimensional objects is performed according to the usual parabolic approximation to the Fresnel-Kirchhoff diffraction integral. The wavefront to be reconstructed by the hologram is, therefore, the superposition of the Fourier transforms of each object plane in depth, modified by a quadratic phase factor.  Point source holograms  The second computational strategy is based on the point source concept, where the object is broken down in self-luminous points. An elementary hologram is calculated for every point source and the final hologram is synthesized by superimposing all the elementary holograms. This concept has been first reported by Waters whose major assumption originated with Rogers who recognized that a Fresnel zone plate could be considered a special case of the hologram proposed by Gabor. But, as far as most of the object points were non-zero, the computational complexity of the point-source concept was much higher than in the Fourier left transformation concept. Some researchers tried to overcome this drawback by predefining and storing all the possible elementary holograms using special data storage techniques because of the huge capacity that is needed in this case, others by using special hardware. In the point-source concept the major problem that has to be circumvented is the trade-off between data storage capacity and computational speed. In particular, algorithms that raise the computational speed usually need very high data storage capabilities, while on the other hand algorithms that lower the data storage requirement lead to high computational complexity, though some optimizations could be achieved. Another concept which leads to point source CGHs is the Ray tracing method. Ray tracing is perhaps the simplest method of computer generated holography to visualize. Essentially, the path length difference between the distance a virtual \\"reference beam\\" and a virtual \\"object beam\\" have to travel is calculated; this will give the relative phase of the scattered object beam. Over the last three decades both concepts have made a remarkable progress improving computational speed and image quality. However, some technical restraints like computation and storage capacity still burden digital holography, making potential real-time applications with current standard computer hardware almost impossible.  Interference pattern encoding  Once it is known what the scattered wavefront of the object looks like or how it may be computed, it must be fixed on a spatial light modulator (SLM), abusing this term to include not only LCD displays or similar devices, but also films and masks. Basically, there are different types of SLMs available: Pure phase modulators (retarding the illuminating wave), pure amplitude modulators (blocking the illumination light), polarization modulators (influencing the polarization state of light) and SLMs which have the capability of combined phase/amplitude modulation. In the case of pure phase or amplitude modulation, clearly quality losses are unavoidable. Early forms of pure amplitude holograms were simply printed in black and white, meaning that the amplitude had to be encoded with one bit of depth only. Similarly, the kinoform is a pure-phase encoding invented at IBM in the early days of CGH. Even if a fully complex phase/amplitude modulation would be ideal, a pure phase or pure amplitude solution is normally preferred because it is much easier to implement technologically. Nevertheless, for the creation of complicated light distribution simultaneous modulation of amplitude and phase is reasonable. So far two different approaches for amplitude-phase-modulation have been implemented. One is based on phase-only or amplitude-only modulation and consecutive spatial filtering, the other one is based on polarization holograms with variable orientation and magnitude of local birefringence.  Reconstruction  The third (technical) issue is beam modulation and actual wavefront reconstruction. Masks may be printed, resulting often in a grained pattern structure since most printers can make only dots (although very small ones). Films may be developed by laser exposure. Holographic displays are currently yet a challenge (), although successful prototypes have been built. An ideal display for computer generated holograms would consist of pixels smaller than a wavelength of light with adjustable phase and brightness. Such displays have been called phased array optics. Further progress in nanotechnology is required to build them.  Applications  Currently, several companies and university departments are researching on the field of CGH devices: * VividQ provides software for real- time CGH devices, allowing for the generation of images with over 200 depth layers using standard computing power * MIT Media Lab has developed the \\"Holovideo\\" CGH display * SeeReal Technologies have prototyped a CGH display * Cortical Cafe CGH Kit is a CGH related hobbyist site with instructions, source code, and a web-application for CGH creation.  In electron optics  Recently computer-generated holography has been extended in its usage beyond light optics, and applied in generating structured electron wavefunctions with a desired amplitude and phase profile. The computer generated holograms are designed by the interference of a target wave with a reference wave, which could be, e.g. a plane-like wave slightly tilted in one direction. The holographic diffractive optical elements used are usually constructed out of thin membranes of materials such as silicon nitride.  References  * Ekberg M., Larsson M., Hård S.

History During the Vichy regime, Leguay was second- in-command to René Bousquet, general secretary of the National Police in Paris. He participated in organising the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup (Rafle du Vel' d'Hiv), the mass arrest of more than 13,000 Jews which took place on 16 and 17 July 1942 in Paris.

With help from local agencies the Alouette River Management Society, Kanaka Education and Environmental Partnership, and the South Coast Conservation Program students and staff removed invasive plants, created a special frog pond habitat to support the endangered red-legged-frogs found in the area, and planted indigenous plants like Douglas Fir, big leaf maple, and red elderberry. Academics Meadowridge School abides by the British Columbia Ministry of Education curriculum while offering the International Baccalaureate program at all grade levels. The International Baccalaureate focuses “on teaching students to think critically and independently, and how to inquire with care and logic” Meadowridge was first authorized for the Primary Years Programme (Junior Kindergarten to Grade 5) on February 19, 2007. The Middle Years Programme (Grade 6 to Grade 10) authorization happened shortly after on March 6, 2007. The Diploma Program (Grade 11 and 12) was authorized on March 1, 2012.

The Class of 2017 had 4.5 acceptance offers per student with 100% of applicants receiving offers from a post-secondary institution. Uniforms Students at all levels are required to wear a school uniform. The school believes that uniforms provide a sense of inclusion, equality, and school pride and that students must identify and distinguish themselves through their behaviour rather than their appearance. There is a formal uniform, referred to as the #1, for Mondays, Fridays and special occasions. There is also an informal uniform, referred to as the #2 uniform, for general wear on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursdays. There is a Physical Education uniform for Physical and Health Education classes as well as athletics and clubs. On Wednesdays, all of the Primary Years students wear their PE for uniform the entire day to provide a full day of activity without taking time to change uniforms. Each athletic team wears a uniform and jersey appropriate for the sport being played. In 2017 a hooded sweatshirt was added to the #2 uniform option. Students have options within the uniform so that they can select a combination that meets their comfort and personal style. Athletics Meadowridge offers a variety of athletic teams and clubs. Athletics clubs are offered for students in Kindergarten to Grade 12 and athletic teams are offered for students in Grade 4 to Grade 12. Meadowridge offers one of the largest fencing clubs in British Columbia and hosts an annual tournament that draws players from all over British Columbia and the northwest United States.

In athletics, Meadowridge offers a wide range of opportunities for students to get involved, not only as team members, but also as officials, support staff, and community coaches. All students at Meadowridge are supported in the attainment of the Duke of Edinburgh Award. Students in Grade 9 and 10 participate in the adventurous journey component of the award through the Outdoor Education Program. They optionally complete the other three components: service, skill development, and community service. Every student at Meadowridge is required to earn their Bronze Duke of Edinburgh Award. House System Meadowridge School is made up of four houses: Alouette (Blue), Kanaka (Red), Fraser (Green), and Whonnock (Orange). Each student, parent, and staff member belongs to one house. Competitions are held throughout the year for house points with two major Spirit Days happening at the beginning and end of the year. During Spirit Day, the four teams will compete against one another in various physical activities where house points are awarded for both success within the activities, as well as sportsmanship and house spirit. The day begins with the groups performing \\"house cheers\\", which are typically parodies of popular songs with added actions. Previously, each house had a mascot character: Alouette an Alligator, Kanaka a Kodiak, Fraser a Falcon, and Whonnock a dragon. However, these were phased out for a variety of reasons. The first was a general concern that these random mascot characters were distracting from the actual school mascot: The Gryphon. The second being that the Kanaka mascot was actually a costume of a popular 4chan- originating Internet meme, with inappropriate implications. The mascot later had a small goatee added to it to try and avoid this, but it was still too recognizable to be used appropriately for a K-12 school. When the mascots were being phased out, there was a discussion about replacing the animal names with Classical Elements: Earth (Kanaka), Wind (Fraser), Water (Allouette), and Fire (Whonnock), though this idea was never implemented. The House with the most spirit points wins the House Cup at the end of the year. Community Service Community service and outreach is an integral part of being a student at Meadowridge School. Service is encouraged at every grade and supports a number of local and international organizations including Cops for Cancer, Covenant House Vancouver, Matthew's House, Florida Wild Horse Rescue, ME to WE, BC Children's Hospital, and the Terry Fox Foundation. Students organize and manage a number of events, volunteer projects, and fundraisers throughout the year including a benefit concert, food hamper sorting, movie night, and awareness campaigns.

It borders the district of Punta Hermosa to the north, the Province of Huarochirí to the east, the district of San Bartolo to the south, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. History In precolombian times, the area of the current district was inhabited by coastal fishermen of the Yungas people, and was under the hegemony of the rulers of Pachacamac, and later the Incas. Post-conquest, the area was known as Tropezon, until passage of the Law Nº 12096 created the modern district of Punta Negra on April 7, 1954. Its name is attributed to an Italo-Peruvian citizen named Lidio Mongilardi, who upon visiting the area for the first time reportedly compared it to a coastal zone in Italy known as Punta Negra. As a popular beach destination, various Peruvian social clubs have beach venues in this district, the most notable being the Country Club El Bosque and the Club Social y Deportes Punta Negra. Geography The district has an area of 130.5 km2, most of which is uninhabited desert. It is estimated to have more than 8,000 permanent residents, and 11,000 during the summer beach season. The district has several beaches, including Cangrejos, Punta Rocas, El Puerto, La Pocita, La Bikini, El Revés, Santa Rosa and Peñascal.

Early life and career Hawthorne was born on 25 May 1964 in Birmingham, England. He earned his PhD from Syracuse University, where he studied with William Alston and Jonathan Bennett. From 2006 to 2015, he was the Waynflete Professor of Metaphysical Philosophy at the University of Oxford. He has also taught at the University of New South Wales, Arizona State University, Syracuse University, Rutgers University, and Princeton University. Philosophical work Hawthorne's 2006 collection Metaphysical Essays offers original treatments of fundamental topics in philosophy, including identity, ontology, vagueness, and causation, which one reviewer called \\"essential reading for anyone currently engaged in analytic metaphysics\\".https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/25198-metaphysical-essays/ In his book Knowledge and Lotteries, Hawthorne defends a view in epistemology according to which the presence of knowledge is dependent on the subject's interests (he calls this view \\"Subject-Sensitive Invariantism\\"). Unlike contextualism, Hawthorne's view does not require that the meaning of the word \\"know\\" changes from one context of ascription to another. His view is thus a variety of invariantism. However, whether a subject has knowledge depends to a surprising extent on features of the subject's context, including practical concerns. The American philosopher Jason Stanley holds a similar view.https://www.yoaavisaacs.com/uploads/6/9/2/0/69204575/ms_for_fine- tuning_fine-tuning.pdf Hawthorne has also written on philosophy of language and philosophical logic, philosophy of religion, philosophy of mind, and on Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.

() Introduction Cyclohexene derivatives, such as imines, epoxides, and halonium ions, react with nucleophiles in a stereoselective fashion, affording trans-diaxial addition products. The term “Trans-diaxial addition” describes the mechanism of the addition, however the products are likely to equilibrate by ring flip to the lower energy conformer, placing the new substituents in the equatorial position. center Mechanism and Stereochemistry Epoxidation of a substituted cyclohexene affords a product where the R group resides in the pseudo-equatorial position. Nucleophilic opening of this epoxide can occur by attack at either the 1 or 2 position. The major product forms from attack at the 1 position, due to the instability of the twist boat product formed by addition at the 2 position (disfavored by approximately 5 kcal/mol).Kirby, A. J.

Gaff House, a contributing property to the Dupont Circle Historic District in Washington, D.C. In the law regulating historic districts in the United States, a contributing property or contributing resource is any building, object, or structure which adds to the historical integrity or architectural qualities that make the historic district, listed locally or federally, significant. Government agencies, at the state, national, and local level in the United States, have differing definitions of what constitutes a contributing property but there are common characteristics. Local laws often regulate the changes that can be made to contributing structures within designated historic districts. The first local ordinances dealing with the alteration of buildings within historic districts was in Charleston, South Carolina in 1931. Properties within a historic district fall into one of two types of property: contributing and non-contributing. A contributing property, such as a 19th-century mansion, helps make a historic district historic, while a non-contributing property, such as a modern medical clinic, does not. The contributing properties are key to a historic district's historic associations, historic architectural qualities, or archaeological qualities. A property can change from contributing to non-contributing and vice versa if significant alterations take place. History According to the National Park Service, the first instance of law dealing with contributing properties in local historic districts occurred in 1931 when the city of Charleston, South Carolina, enacted an ordinance that designated the \\"Old and Historic District.\\"\\"Early Models,\\" Working on the Past in Local Historic Districts, National Park Service. Retrieved 23 April 2007. The ordinance declared that buildings in the district could not have changes made to their architectural features visible from the street. By the mid-1930s, other U.S. cities followed Charleston's lead. An amendment to the Louisiana Constitution led to the 1937 creation of the Vieux Carre Commission, which was charged with protecting and preserving the French Quarter in the city of New Orleans. The city then passed a local ordinance that set standards regulating changes within the quarter. Other sources, such as the Columbia Law Review in 1963, indicate differing dates for the preservation ordinances in both Charleston and New Orleans. The Columbia Law Review gave dates of 1925 for the New Orleans laws and 1924 for Charleston.\\"The Police Power, Eminent Domain, and the Preservation of Historic Property (in Notes),\\" (JSTOR), Columbia Law Review, Vol. 63, No. 4. (Apr., 1963), pp. 708-732. Retrieved 23 April 2007. The same publication claimed that these two cities were the only cities with historic district zoning until Alexandria, Virginia adopted an ordinance in 1946. The National Park Service appears to refute this. In 1939, the city of San Antonio, Texas, enacted an ordinance that protected the area of La Villita, which was the city's original Mexican village marketplace. In 1941 the authority of local design controls on buildings within historic districts was being challenged in court. In City of New Orleans vs Pergament (198 La. 852, 5 So. 2d 129 (1941)) Louisiana state appellate courts ruled that the design and demolition controls were valid within defined historic districts. Beginning in the mid-1950s, controls that once applied to only historic districts were extended to individual landmark structures.Pyke, John S. Jr. \\" Architectural Controls and the Individual Landmark,\\" (JSTOR), Law and Contemporary Problems, Vol. 36, No. 3, Historic Preservation. (Summer, 1971), pp. 398-405. Retrieved 23 April 2007. The United States Congress adopted legislation that declared the Georgetown neighborhood in Washington, D.C. protected in 1950. By 1965, 51 American communities had adopted preservation ordinances.

National Park Service, 1997, 10. Contributing versus non-contributing East Grove Street Historic District in Bloomington, Illinois is an example of a non- contributing property. The line between contributing and non-contributing can be fuzzy. In particular, American historic districts nominated to the National Register of Historic Places before 1980 have few records of the non- contributing structures. State Historic Preservation Offices conduct surveys to determine the historical character of structures in historic districts. Districts nominated to the National Register of Historic Places after 1980 usually list those structures considered non-contributing. As a general rule, a contributing property helps make a historic district historic. A well- preserved 19th-century mansion will generally contribute to a district, while a modern gas station generally will not. Historic buildings identified as contributing properties can become non-contributing properties within historic districts if major alterations have taken place. Sometimes, an act as simple as re-siding a historic home can damage its historic integrity and render it non-contributing. In some cases, damage to the historic integrity of a structure is reversible, while other times the historic nature of a building has been so \\"severely compromised\\" as to be irreversible.East Grove Street District , (PDF), National Register Nomination Form, HAARGIS Database, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency. Retrieved 26 March 2007. For example, in the East Grove Street District in Bloomington, Illinois, contributing properties include the Queen Anne-style George H. Cox House (1886) and the Arts and Crafts-style H.W.

By February 1863 Ryley was singing comic songs at Deacon’s Music Hall, Sadler's Wells Theatre, Price’s Music Hall and then at the Bedford Music Hall in Camden Town as \\"the comical comique\\". He married the actress Marie Barnam in 1864, and they had a daughter, Wallace (b. 1869). The couple performed a comic duet and dance act in London and on tour, and they were engaged at the Gaiety Theatre, London in 1872. A New York critic later claimed that their \\"Dancing Quakers\\" routine was parodied by Margaret and Despard in Gilbert and Sullivan's 1887 opera Ruddigore.Stone, David. \\"J. H. Ryley\\", Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, 8 August 2011, accessed 7 June 2012 Ryley also appeared at The Gaiety in a musical play, Ali Baba a la Mode, in 1872. He and Barnam soon separated.Engle, Sherry Darlene.\\"Madeleine Lucette Ryley\\", New Women Dramatists in America, 1890–1920, pp. 55–79, Macmillan, 2007 In 1875, Ryley played Fernando in the comic opera Cattarina by Robert Reece and Frederic Clay at the Charing Cross Theatre and later on tour. In Manchester in 1876, he played Captain Flint in The Sultan of Mocha by Alfred Cellier. Later that year, he created the role of Zapeter in W. S. Gilbert and Clay's Princess Toto at the Theatre Royal in Nottingham and on tour in the provinces and next played Amen Squeak in Nell Gwynne by Cellier at Prince's Theatre in Manchester. Ryley as Ko Ko in The Mikado in New York (1885) Ryley joined Richard D'Oyly Carte's Comedy-Opera Company Ltd. in 1878, appearing as John Wellington Wells in the first provincial production of The Sorcerer, and the Learned Judge in Trial by Jury on the same bill. In September 1878, the company gave the first provincial tour of H.M.S. Pinafore, with Ryley as Sir Joseph Porter. In October the company added Congenial Souls, a one-act farce written by Ryley using music by Jacques Offenbach, to the program as a curtain raiser. This appears to be the only play written by Ryley.Walters, Michael and George Low. Congenial Souls, 19 September 2007, accessed 13 May 2018 Madeleine Lucette (1858–1934) appeared together with Riley on tour with the D'Oyly Carte company in 1878, and she played Clara in his curtain raiser, while he played Adolphus.Stone, David. \\"Madeleine Lucette\\", Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, 25 February 2005, accessed 7 June 2012 In 1879, Ryley was chosen to play Sir Joseph in the first authentic American production of Pinafore at New York City's Fifth Avenue Theatre, which opened on 1 December 1879. On 31 December of that year, in the same theatre, he created the role of Major General Stanley in The Pirates of Penzance and continued with the role in the US tour until June 1880. Over the next several years, Ryley and the much younger Lucette both performed in America, sometimes together, over the next several years, behaving as if married, and eventually lived in New Rochelle, New York, together with his daughter Wallace. They were not legally married until 1890, however, after Ryley finalised his divorce from his first wife. Ryley appeared in leading roles in all of the New York productions of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company until 1883. He was Captain Felix Flapper in Billee Taylor (1881), Reginald Bunthorne in Patience (1881–82), Blood Red Bill in Edward Solomon's Claude Duval (1882), Philip of Aragon and Don Jose de Mantilla Les Manteaux Noirs (1882), Peter van Dunk in Rip Van Winkle (1882, with Selina Dolaro), and the Lord Chancellor in Iolanthe and Mr. Cox in Cox and Box (1882–83).Reviews mentioning Ryley, and particularly praising his Bunthorne He continued to appear in major Gilbert and Sullivan productions in America after leaving the company. In 1884, he played King Gama in New York's first production of Princess Ida at the Fifth Avenue Theatre and also starred in Falka at the Casino Theatre.See \\"Falka at the Casino\\". The New York Times, 15 April 1884, accessed 17 December 2010 In 1885, he played Ko-Ko in The Mikado at the Standard Theatre in New York and then in Chicago. Later years Ryley in Iolanthe as the Lord Chancellor in 1887 In 1887, Ryley starred in Gasparone by Karl Millöcker in New York City at the Standard Theatre, together with Lillian Russell and Eugene Oudin.New York Times review of 1887 New York production He also appeared with Russell in a tour that included Iolanthe (as Lord Chancellor, 1887), and was Jack Point in The Yeomen of the Guard in Boston, Massachusetts in February 1889. Ryley continued to appear in New York and on tour in America during most of the 1890s. He and his wife returned to England, where he appeared in London on several occasions between 1900 and 1913. Among his London roles were Kit Barniger in Mice and Men (1902 at the Lyric Theatre, leased by William Greet)Mice and Men was written by his wife, Madeleine Lucette Ryley and Josh Harmony in Mrs. Grundy (Scala Theatre, 1905), both plays by his wife who had become a successful playwright by the mid-1890s in both New York and London. Ryley was involved in the production of many of his wife's plays and often directed them. The couple also travelled extensively. Ryley made two films later in his career, first as the Gravedigger in a 1913 silent film version of Hamlet, starring his good friend Johnston Forbes-Robertson. His other film credit was the 1916 mystery, Who Killed Simon Baird?. Ryley died at the age of 81 in Edgware, Middlesex, survived by Lucette.

The Union Flag is in the canton. The Civil Air Ensign was instituted by an Order in Council on 11 August 1931. The order stated that \\"An ensign called the Civil Air Ensign is the proper national colour to be flown by aircraft and air transport undertakings and at aerodromes.\\" The first Civil Air Ensign to be flown in London was hoisted by Mrs Victor Bruce, the noted British woman aviator. The 1931 Order was revoked by the Civil Air Ensign Order made on 18 March 1937 additionally permitting the use of the flag on buildings used by the Ministry of Civil Aviation or air transport undertakings, on vehicles used personally by the Minister and by any person given special permission by the Minister.MCA File SG74/01, CAA Library The tail of a de Havilland Tiger Moth showing the Civil Air Ensign on the rudder. The prototype flag had been made up in silk and was kept throughout World War II by the Civil Aviation Department in a series of locations in London. In October 1948 it was handed to the Ministry of Civil Aviation Library for retention and display. The visible stains on the light blue silk were said to have been caused by water from the fire brigade's hoses used in quelling a fire in the roof at Parliament Square House, caused by a German incendiary bomb, whilst the CAD was accommodated there. In 1957, a ministry working party reviewing the Air Navigation Order concluded that it was anomalous to regulate the use of the Civil Air Ensign when no special regulations were required to control the use of its maritime equivalent, the Red Ensign. All mention of the Civil Air Ensign was therefore omitted from the Air Navigation Order 1960. It was part of the livery, as the tail logo, of the Civil Aviation Flying Unit (CAFU) and its predecessors from 1944 to 1982. In 1982 the last two HS 748s were repainted in a CAA corporate blue and white scheme and the Civil Air Ensign was replaced by the Union Flag.

WYSS also carries Lake Superior State University Lakers hockey broadcasts, becoming the Lakers' official on-air home in 2009. History The station took to the air in July 1972 with 3,000 watts at 92.7 FM as WSMM, owned by Lock City Broadcasting, becoming the first FM radio station in the Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan market, and the second radio station total based in the city. The station initially programmed a format of MOR and country music. Lock City sold WSMM to Chippewa Broadcasting in 1974, and a few years later the station moved from 92.7 to 99.5 with a dramatic power increase to 26,500 watts. During the late 1970s, the station featured a soft rock format. As WLXX (1981-1986), the station continued with its AC format and eventually added nighttime Top-40 programming, competing with CKCY. \\"Yes FM\\" was born on February 1, 1985 when Delbyco Broadcasting (Del Reynolds and Byron Bordt) purchased WLXX, changed the call letters to WYSS, and initiated a full-time Top-40/contemporary hit radio format in Sault Ste.

The village is believed to have been inhabited since biblical times. An ancient tunnel which led to the village spring is associated with story of Samson. Both during and after its incorporation into Crusader fiefdoms in the 12th century, its population was Arab. Sheikhs from the Lahham family clan, who were associated with the Qays tribo-political faction, ruled the village during Ottoman era. In the 19th century, this clan controlled 24 villages in the vicinity. The homes were built of stone. The local farmers cultivated cereals, fruit trees and olive groves and some engaged in livestock breeding. After a military assault on Bayt ʿIṭāb by Israeli forces in October 1948, the village was depopulated and demolished. Many of the villagers had fled to refugee camps in the West Bank less than from the village. In 1950, an Israeli moshav, Nes Harim, was established north of the built up portion of Bayt 'Itab, on an adjacent peak.Porcupines, Emperors, and the New Middle East, Eretz Magazine History Crusader ruins at Bayt Itab. Bayt ʿIṭāb is identified with Enadab, a name that appears in a list of Palestinian towns compiled by Eusebius in the fourth century CE.Eusebius, Onomasticon - The Place Names of Divine Scripture, (ed.) R. Steve Notley & Ze'ev Safrai, Brill: Leiden 2005, p. 92 (§477) Crusader era In the mid-12th century, Bayt ʿIṭāb hosted an impressive maison forte, or hall house, in the ancient centre of the modern village, that is thought to have served as the residence of Johannes Gothman, a Frankish crusader knight. The building had two stories, both vaulted; the ground floor entrance was protected by a slit-machicolation and had stairs leading to the basement and upper floor.CHRAM, 1994, p. 342 Nonetheless, his wife was forced to sell his landholdings after he was taken prisoner by Islamic forces in 1161, in order to raise the money needed for his ransom.de Roziére, 1849, pp. 195-199, No. 99-100; cited in Röhricht, 1893, RRH, p. 97, No 368-9Riley-Smith, 2001, p. 171Pringle, 1997, p.26 It was then acquired by and made a fief of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, possibly organised by the Order of the Holy Sepulchre.Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, p. 23 The Arabic name of the village appears in Latin transliteration as Bethaatap in a list recording the sale of the land holdings belonging to Gothman in 1161.Levy, 1998, p. 505 Its affiliations with the Crusader era has led some to erroneously characterize the village as \\"Crusader\\", when in fact its habitation by Arabs predates, persisted through and extended beyond this period.Benvenisti, 2002, in a chapter named \\"The Convenience of the Crusades\\", p. 301 Ottoman era Edward Robinson visited the village in 1838, and described its stone houses, several of which had two storeys, as solidly built. In the center of the village were the ruins of a castle or tower. Robinson estimates, the village population was six to seven hundred people. He notes that Beit 'Atab, as he transcribes it, was the chief town of the 'Arkub (Arqub) district and the Nazir (warden) of the district lived there. Robinson recounts that he was \\"a good-looking man\\" from the Lahaam clan, and that when they arrived in the village, he was sitting conversing with other sheikhs on a carpet under a fig tree. Rising to greet them, he invited them to stay for the night, but as they were in a hurry to see more of the country before the setting of the sun, and so declined his offer.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 2, p. 338. Cited in Khalidi, 1992, p. 274 In the mid-19th century, the sheikh of Bayt 'Itab was named 'Utham al-Lahham (Sheikh 'Othman al-Lahaam). He had been exiled in 1846, but had managed to escape and return. A supporter of the Qays faction, Lahham was in conflict with the Yamani faction leaders, especially the sheikh of Abu Ghosh.Schölch, 1993, p. 231 In the 1850s the conflict between these two families over the control of the district of Bani Hasan dominated the area.Schölch, 1993, p. 229 As Meron Benvenisti writes, al-Lahham waged \\"a bloody war against Sheik Mustafa Abu Ghosh, whose capital and fortified seat was in the village of Suba.\\" In 1855, Mohammad Atallah in Bayt Nattif, a cousin of 'Utham al-Lahham, contested his rule over the region. In order to win support from Abu Ghosh, Mohammad Atallah changed side over to the Yamani faction. This is said to have enraged 'Utham al-Lahham. He raised a fighting force and fell on Bayt Nattif on 3 January 1855. The village lost 21 dead. According to an eyewitness description by the horrified British consul, James Finn, their corpses were terribly mutilated.Schölch, 1993, p. 232Meron Benvenisti notes that, \\"The long history of Beit ʿIṭāb and the tale of the wars of the Quays and Yaman have been recounted at length in many books, and British consul James Finn (mid-nineteenth century) left a particularly vivid description of this village and its houses, both ancient and new. But there is no mention of any of this in Israeli guidebooks, save for the routine remark, \\"destroyed in the War for Independence.\\" By contrast, the guidebook makes sure to inform its readers that \\"it is almost certain that its Arab name, Beit ʿIṭāb, is a corruption of its Latin name, Atap, meaning a small fortress,\\" and at the site there are \\"remains of ancient structures, apparently from a Crusader farm.\\"\\" In February 1855, the Abu Ghosh-family came to the aid of Atallah, conquered Bayt ʿIṭāb, and imprisoned ʿUtham al-Laḥḥām in his own house. With the help of one of the younger members of the Abu Ghosh-family, James Finn was able to negotiate a cease-fire between the Atallah and Lahham -factions in Bayt 'Itab. For three years, relative peace reigned in the area; however, the Ottoman Governor of Jerusalem, Thurayya Pasha, and his policy of consolidating Ottoman control over the local districts, step by step, led to the last rebellion of the sheikhs in 1858-59. By the fall of 1859, when 'Utham al-Lahham was ninety years old, both he and Mohammad Atallah were deported to Cyprus by Thurayya Pasha. The rest of the Laḥḥām family was resettled in Ramla.Schölch, 1993, pp.232-3, party based on Finn, p.193 ff. When French explorer Victor Guérin visited the village in 1863, \\"he found that the Sheikh's house, with the adjoining houses, is built upon the site of an old fort, some vaults of which remain, and seemed to him older than the Crusades. The people say that there is a subterranean passage from the castle to the spring at the bottom of the hill. They also told him that the village of Eshua (4 miles to the north-west) was formerly called Ashtual, and that between the villages of Sur'ah and Eshua is a waly consecrated to the Sheikh Gherib, and known also as the Kabr Shamshun, Tomb of Samson.\\"Guérin, 1869, pp. 381-3, as cited in Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, p. 83 Socin found from an official Ottoman village list from about 1870 that Bayt 'Itab had a population of 241, with a total of 89 houses, though the population count included men, only.Socin, 1879, p. 145 Hartmann found that Bayt 'Itab had 100 houses.Hartmann, 1883, p. 145 In the late 19th century, Bayt ʿIṭāb was described as a village built on stone, perched on a rocky knoll that rose 60 to 100 feet above the surrounding hilly ridge. Its population in 1875 was approximately 700, all Muslim. Olive trees were cultivated on terraces to the north of the village. A large cavern (18 feet wide and 6 feet high) ran beneath the houses. Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, pp. 22-24. Also quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 275 In 1896 the population of Bet 'atab was estimated to be about 543 persons.Schick, 1896, p. 123 British Mandatory period In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted i by the British Mandate authorities, Bayt 'Itab had a population of 504 residents; all Muslims,Barron, 1923, Table VII, Sub-district of Ramleh, p. 21 increasing in the 1931 census to 606, still all Muslims, in a total of 187 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 19 It was in the sub-district of Ramle, but due to the rearrangement of district boundaries it was later in the sub-district of Jerusalem.Kark and Oren- Nordheim, 2001, p. 192 The original layout of Bayt ʿIṭāb was circular, but newer construction to the southwest (towards Sufla), gave the village an arc- shape. Most houses were built of stone. Agriculture was the main source of income. The village owned extensive areas on the coastal plain that were planted with grain. During the British Mandate in Palestine, some of this land was expropriated to make a large, government-owned woodland. In the 1945 statistics, it had a population of 540 Muslims, with 5,447 dunums of land. Of this, a total of 1,400 dunams were used for cereals, 665 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945.

The village was depopulated between 19–24 October 1948, after the Harel Brigade captured the village as part of Operation Ha-Har. This operation was complementary to Operation Yoav, a simultaneous offensive on the southern front. Most of the village population fled southwards, towards Bethlehem and Hebron.Morris, 2004, p. 466 Many refugees from Bayt 'Itab, and other Palestinian villages clustered together on the western slope of the Judean mountains, ended up in Dheisheh refugee camp in the West Bank, roughly from their former homes.Rosenfeld, 2004, p. 322 One IDF account says that when the Harel Brigade approached the village at night, they already found the village deserted, but proceeded to destroy its houses.Har’el: Palmach brigade in Jerusalem, Zvi Dror (ed. Nathan Shoḥam), Hakibbutz Hameuchad Publishers: Benei Barak 2005, p. 270 (Hebrew) In 1950, the Israeli village of Nes Harim was established north of the village site on village land. In 1992, Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi found the site strewn with rubble and the remains of a Crusader fortress. He noted two cemeteries that lay east and west of the village, and the fact that some of the surrounding land was cultivated by Israeli farmers. In 2002, the Israel Nature and Parks Authority established a 130-dunam national park in the area, known as Horvat 'Itab. Remains at the site include a Crusader fortress, vaults, remnants of a wall and towers, tunnels, a columbarium and an olive press. A conservation project was undertaken to stabilize the vaulted building utilizing traditional technology.Horvat Beit ‘Itab, Conservation-engineering stabilization Geography Bayt ʿIṭāb was located south southwest of Jerusalem, on a high mountain above sea level, overlooking some lower mountains peaks below.Khalidi, 1992, p. 274 A Roman road ran along a narrow ridge to the south of the village which also passed by Solomon's Pools.Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, p. 38 A low cliff to the east of the village was known as 'Arâk el-Jemâl (\\"the cliff, cavern or buttress of the camels\\").Palmer, 1881, p. 284 Southeast of the village on the main road was the chief village spring known as ʿAin Beit ʿAṭāb () or ʿAin Haud.Palmer, 1881, p. 278 Below this spring to the northwest, was a pool known as Birket 'Atab with its own spring, \`Ain el-Birkeh.Palmer, 1881, p. 279 Another spring nearby was known as 'Ain el Khanzierh (\\"the spring of the sow\\").Palmer, 1881, p. 280 Connecting the village to the chief spring was a rock tunnel said to be \\"of great antiquity,\\" the entrance of which was known only to those well acquainted with the site.Lias, 2009, pp. 165-166 This cavern or tunnel, known in Arabic as Mgharat Bīr el-Hasuta, (\\"Cave of the Well of Hasuta\\") is \\"evidently artificial,\\" and was hewn into the rock.Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, p. 137 Some 250 feet long, it runs in a south-south-west direction from the village emerging as a vertical shaft (6 ft x 5 ft x 10 ft deep) about 60 yards away from the spring that supplied the village with water. The average height of the tunnel is about 5 to 8 feet with a width of about 18 feet. There were two entrances to it from the village, one in the west, and the other at the center, the latter being closed at one author's time of writing in the 19th century. Biblical identification In 1879, Lieutenant C. R. Conder, of the Palestine Exploration Fund (PEF), thought that the place Bayt ʿIṭāb should be identified with the biblical site known as \\"Rock of Etam\\" (Judges 15:11), by way of a corruption of its name, and which, according to Conder, was not a town at all, but \\"a strong rock.\\"Conder, 1879, pp. 273, 275Conder, 1878, p. 117 John William McGarvey (1881) quotes Conder on the linguistic evidence: \\"The substitution of B for M is so common (as in Tibneh for Timnah) that the name Atab may very properly represent the Hebrew Etam (eagle's nest); and there are other indications as to the identity of the site.\\"McGarvey, 2002, pp. 246-247 Survey of Western Palestine (1883), notes that the name of the \\"curious cave\\" at Bayt ʿIṭāb in Arabic is Bir el-Has Utah. Unable to find a meaning for the word in Arabic, they find it corresponds to the Hebrew word Hasutah, \\"[...] which is translated 'a place of refuge.' Thus the name seems to indicate that this place has been used from a very early time as a lurking or hiding place, as we gather it to have been in the time of Samson.\\" McGarvey also relays Conder's belief that the cavern within the rock formation was \\"the real hiding place\\" of Samson after his destruction of the Philistine's grains. Henry B. Tristram (1897) writes of Bayt 'Itab that it crowned \\"a remarkable rocky knoll,\\" which he states is, \\"probably, the Rock Etam.\\" Noting that an ancient tunnel ran down from the village eastward through the rock to the chief spring, he speculates that this would have made a good hiding place for Samson when according to biblical tradition, he \\"went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam\\" (Book of Judges, xv. 8).Tristram, 1897, pp. 66-67 See also *List of Arab towns and villages depopulated during the 1948 Palestinian exodus *List of villages depopulated during the Arab-Israeli conflict ReferencesBibliography   (Unhman al-Latham description: p230) *(Bayt 'Itab: p.193 ff.)

The school currently offers various curriculum: Special Program in Science Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) for the Special Science Class, Basic Education Curriculum for the Regular Class, Special Program for the Arts, Special Class in Culture and Sports and the Basic Education Curriculum for the Night Class. The Negros Occidental High School has an Extension in the Murcia, Negros Occidental and later on its changed its name to Murcia National High Schoolhttps://nearbyph.com/pages/negros-occidental-high-school/41057  History  The foundation for the establishment of a Provincial High School in Negros Occidental was already laid in 1901 by the Division Superintendent, George W. Beattie, so that when Act 372 of the Philippine Commission was passed on March 7, 1901, empowering the Provincial Boards of the country to provide funds for the erection or renting and other expenses for a secondary school in the province, Beattie was ready for implementation of the plan, including the hiring of teachers in time for the opening of the school on July 1, 1902. Rizal Elementary School Sometime in 1902, former leaders of the Republica de Negros, Ex-minister of Justice Antonio Ledesma Jayme and Ex- provincial Governor Melecio Severino exerted efforts for the opening of a secondary school in Occidental Negros which they named Instituto Rizal, now Negros Occidental High School. The Rizal Elementary School was first founded in Bacolod City as \\"Instituto de Rizal\\" by Severino and Jayme. However Severino was an avowed nationalist, and was still governor of the province until May 1, 1901 so that his role in the creation of the school was important. Jayme was Severino's rival for governor on the election of 1899, and his house was rented for the first classrooms and dormitories for the Institute. It is possible that they were instrumental in helping the Division Superintendent and in naming the school Instituto Rizal. By the opening of the school in 1902, there were three teachers and 125 students taking academic and normal courses in Instituto Rizal. The establishment of the Instituto Rizal was not smooth. As of June 1902, only the Provincial Treasurer of the Provincial Board was favorable to the school idea but the Governor (Leandro Locsin) was \\"indifferent and the supervisor was avowed hostile\\". However the idea of a high school was pushed through because the supervisor was not a member of the Provincial Board and the Treasurer was an American who held sway in the Provincial Board. Instituto Rizal was renting two spacious buildings for classrooms and separate dormitories for boy and girls who reside outside Bacolod City. Mr. Ray Howell was the school principal. By July 1903, Instituto Rizal had already four teachers with an average attendance of 166 students, an increase of 100 as compare to the attendance of the previous year. The school was closed from September 7 to November 10, 1902 because of a cholera epidemic. Instituto Rizal became Rizal Institute in compliance with Executive Order No. 44, series of 1912, which mandated English as the official language of the Philippines, starting 1 January 1913, the school authorities were prompted to officially adopt the name Rizal Institute. Don Antonio Jayme, who owned lands and houses in Bacolod, provided the first classrooms and dormitories of the school, which were rented using funds allocated by the provincial board. In 1927, the permanent high school building was constructed at the present site. The construction was finished about 1931. When classes were transferred to the newly constructed building in September 1931, the name inscribed in the building facade read, \\"Bacolod High School\\". This was because in the public works program under the Appropriations Act of 1927, the name appearing was: \\"the construction of the Bacolod High School\\". However, the name was never officially used, instead the name Negros Occidental High School was used in all communications. NOGCHS In 1970, NOHS was drastically changed to Negros Occidental General comprehensive High School (NOGCHS) by virtue of R.A. 5694, series of 1970. It was passed in Congress without proper consultations from the students and alumni. Enraged, the school alumni lead the legal battle to change it. It took more than ten years of legal battle by the alumni and friends to eventually pass Batas Pambansa No. 2193, series of 1983 which changed NOGCHS back to its old name, the Negros Occidental High School.  School Administration (1902-1935)  NOHS was managed by American school principals from its beginning in 1902 up to the year 1935 when the Commonwealth of the Philippines took effect.

In January 2008, they went on the Northwest Winter Rock Tour with The Send and Ruth; and then later on the Credential Recordings Tour with other Credential bands in April 2008. The band started as a combination of two different bands that attended the same church (Riverlakes Church). Black, Johnson and Short were in a band called The Last Of Us with Jonny Buell and Lewis Conger. Gray had been in a band called the Curves. Buell left the Last of Us and the remaining members wanted to continue playing. Gray had finished playing with the Curves and joined in with the Last of Us under the new name Vow and Volition. Vow and Volition initially played frequently live as a post hardcore band attempting to fuse metal, punk and emo. The band had difficulty hiring a vocalist that could do the screaming and singing vocals Conger desired the band to have. Unable to find a good vocalist, the band began to have disagreements in the direction and style of music they would write. Conger, the chief song writer at the time, was hard to work with and eventually left the band over musical differences and self admitted \\"immaturity.\\" The band decided to continue and Gray stepped in as the vocalist and changed their name to Lost Ocean.

History In the early 1920s, Geoffrey de Havilland realised that war surplus aircraft would need replacing, so his company designed a four-passenger-cabin biplane, the DH.50, using experience gained with the earlier de Havilland DH.9. The first DH.50 (registered G-EBFN) flew in August 1923 and was used within a few days by Alan Cobham to win a prize for reliability during trial flights between Copenhagen and Gothenburg. Only 17 aircraft were built by de Havilland; the rest were produced under licence. The different aircraft had a wide variety of engine fits. In 1924, Cobham won the King's Cup Race air race in G-EBFN averaging 106 mph (171 km/h). Cobham made several long-range flights with the prototype until he replaced it with the second aircraft. The second aircraft (registered G-EBFO) was re-engined with the Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar engine and was designated the DH.50J. Cobham flew the aircraft on a 16,000 mi (25,750 km) flight from Croydon Airport to Cape Town between November 1925 and February 1926. The aircraft was later fitted with twin floats (produced by Short Brothers at Rochester) for a survey flight of Australia in 1926. On the outward flight from England to Australia, Cobham's engineer (A.B. Elliot) was shot and killed when they were overflying the desert between Baghdad and Basra. He was replaced by Sergeant Ward, a Royal Air Force engineer who was given permission to join the flight by his commanding officer. Also in 1926, a DH.50A floatplane was used in the first international flight made by the Royal Australian Air Force. The Chief of the Air Staff, Group Captain Richard Williams, and two crew members undertook a three-month, 10,000 mi (16,093 km) round trip from Point Cook, Victoria to the Pacific Islands. Licence production The aircraft was popular in Australia and de Havilland licensed its production there, leading to 16 aircraft being built. Qantas built four DH.50As and three DH.50Js, Western Australian Airlines built three DH.50As, and Larkin Aircraft Supply Company built one DH.50A. SABCA built three DH.50As in Brussels, Belgium and Aero built seven in Prague, then in Czechoslovakia. The British-built QANTAS DH.50 (G-AUER/VH-UER) was modified in Longreach, Queensland, to suit the Australian Inland Mission as an aerial ambulance. The aircraft was called Victory by the Rev. J Flynn and was the first aircraft used by the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia. Variants * DH.50 : Single-engined light transport biplane.

One for which the probability is not 1/2 is called a biased or unfair coin. In theoretical studies, the assumption that a coin is fair is often made by referring to an ideal coin. John Edmund Kerrich performed experiments in coin flipping and found that a coin made from a wooden disk about the size of a crown and coated on one side with lead landed heads (wooden side up) 679 times out of 1000. In this experiment the coin was tossed by balancing it on the forefinger, flipping it using the thumb so that it spun through the air for about a foot before landing on a flat cloth spread over a table. Edwin Thompson Jaynes claimed that when a coin is caught in the hand, instead of being allowed to bounce, the physical bias in the coin is insignificant compared to the method of the toss, where with sufficient practice a coin can be made to land heads 100% of the time. Exploring the problem of checking whether a coin is fair is a well-established pedagogical tool in teaching statistics.  Role in statistical teaching and theory  The probabilistic and statistical properties of coin-tossing games are often used as examples in both introductory and advanced text books and these are mainly based in assuming that a coin is fair or \\"ideal\\". For example, Feller uses this basis to introduce both the idea of random walks and to develop tests for homogeneity within a sequence of observations by looking at the properties of the runs of identical values within a sequence. The latter leads on to a runs test. A time-series consisting of the result from tossing a fair coin is called a Bernoulli process.  Fair results from a biased coin  If a cheat has altered a coin to prefer one side over another (a biased coin), the coin can still be used for fair results by changing the game slightly. John von Neumann gave the following procedure: # Toss the coin twice. # If the results match, start over, forgetting both results. # If the results differ, use the first result, forgetting the second. The reason this process produces a fair result is that the probability of getting heads and then tails must be the same as the probability of getting tails and then heads, as the coin is not changing its bias between flips and the two flips are independent. This works only if getting one result on a trial doesn't change the bias on subsequent trials, which is the case for most non-malleable coins (but not for processes such as the Pólya urn). By excluding the events of two heads and two tails by repeating the procedure, the coin flipper is left with the only two remaining outcomes having equivalent probability. This procedure only works if the tosses are paired properly; if part of a pair is reused in another pair, the fairness may be ruined. Also, the coin must not be so biased that one side has a probability of zero. This method may be extended by also considering sequences of four tosses. That is, if the coin is flipped twice but the results match, and the coin is flipped twice again but the results match now for the opposite side, then the first result can be used. This is because HHTT and TTHH are equally likely. This can be extended to any power of 2.

He is a former member of the House of Representatives for GreenLeft. Duyvendak is the eldest son of a minister from Zeist. After his high school he studied sociology at the University of Amsterdam between 1976 and 1980. He did not finish his studies and instead became involved the leftwing Amsterdam action world: he became involved in the squatting movement and the anti-militarist action group Onkruit. In 1984 he was jailed for six weeks for having broken into the Dubbeldam military complex together with other members of Onkruit. Between 1984 and 1987 he wrote for the radical magazine Bluf!. After that he became involved in the Anti-Apartheid Committee \\"Get Shell out of South Africa\\" and he was an editor at the publisher Ravijn. De Telegraaf and HP/De Tijd-journalist Peter Siebelt have claimed that Duyvendak was involved with the violent Revolutionary Anti-Racist Action group. Duyvendak has always denied any involvement in violent action. In 1993 he began to work for MilieuDefensie and led their campaigns against the extension of Schiphol Airport. In 1999 he became the director of MilieuDefensie's bureau, which he remained until 2002. Duyvendak was elected in the 2002 elections as a member of the GreenLeft list. In parliament he focused on environmental issues, spatial planning and transport. He was considered one of the most important 'green faces' of the GreenLeft. He has initiated some plans for governmental reform, including the temporary law on the referendum, together with Niesco Dubbelboer of the social-democrat PvdA, which was rejected in 2005. He supported a constitutional amendment providing for referendums together with Dubbelboer and Boris van der Ham of the social- liberal D66 party. He has researched the power of those committees, commissions and councils which were not, in his view, under sufficient parliamentary scrutiny. He chaired the GreenLeft's campaign committee. In 2008, Duyvendak published his book Klimaatactivist in de politiek (A climate activist in politics). In this book, he described his run-ins with the law, including his 1984 jailing. He also mentioned how, in 1985, he admitted having stolen documents on nuclear power plants during a burglary on the Dutch ministry of economic affairs. Previously, Duyvendak always denied such involvement. The fall-out was severe, prompting calls for his resignation, especially after media reported that the burglary had led to threats of violence against civil servants. On 13 August 2008 NRC Handelsblad published an open letter by George Verberg, previous director-general of the ministry of economic affairs and responsible for the area of nuclear power. He accused Duyvendak of inciting people to terrorize his family in the eighties and claimed to have received burning rags through the letterbox and threatening phone calls in the middle of the night.

The forest is a short distance from the Lake District national park and is surrounded by a large number of woodlands west of the Pennines. It is notable today for the presence of Center Parcs and a red squirrel reserve. It was notable historically for its associations with Lady Anne Clifford, Brougham Castle and Inglewood Forest. History Whinfell Forest has existed since at least 1203 when it \\"formed part of King John's grant of the Barony of Westmorland to Robert de Veteripont\\". In 1283 it was divided between Isabella and Idonea, daughters of Robert II de Vieuxpont. It is frequently mentioned in the diaries of Lady Anne Clifford (1590–1676) as she travelled in the area visiting Brougham Castle and Appleby-in-Westmorland. Whinfell Park was at the core of the forest. Its proximity to Inglewood Forest meant that it was mentioned in court documents relating to disputes between the two areas. The park contained two frequently mentioned landmark trees: the Harthorn Tree and the Three Brother Tree. The Harthorn Tree had a hart's horn embedded in it. The Three Brother Tree was the sole survivor of three unusually large oaks called the Three Brethren. The site of the Harthorn Tree is marked on old maps. The name \\"Three Oaks\\" is used within the Center Parcs site. By 1779, the park had been divided into farms by enclosure. Today, the forest forms part of the Lowther estates.

One of the key men in the Standard Oil Trust, Rogers was one of the last of the robber barons of the Gilded Age in the United States. He was also a \\"secret\\" philanthropist. Rogers was a major developer of coal and railroad properties in West Virginia along the Kanawha River. Aboard the Kanawha, he frequently hosted his friends, including American humorist Mark Twain and black educator Booker T. Washington. After Rogers' death in 1909, the Kanawha served the U.S. Navy during World War I. After the war, it was sold to Marcus Garvey's ill-fated Black Star Line and renamed the S.S. Antonio Maceo. However, the former luxury yacht was apparently in poor condition by this time. A boiler, used to generate steam to drive the ship, exploded, and a crewman was killed, while the vessel was located off the Virginia coast on its first voyage from New York to Cuba. Construction Consolidated Shipbuilding was a builder of luxury yachts. The Kanawha was built in 1899 at the shipyard on Matthewson Road, in the Morris Heights section of the Bronx, New York City. The shipyard moved after World War II. The former shipyard property later became part of Roberto Clemente State Park. The 471-ton Kanawha was approximately long. Manned by a crew of 39 people, Kanawha was often compared by the newspapers of the day to the North Star, the yacht of a member of the Vanderbilt family. Even among its contemporaries in the fleet of the New York Yacht Club, Kanawha was a large vessel. The yacht cost $350,000 to build, and it had a record- setting speed of 22.2 knots.Charleston (S.C.) News & Courier, Apr. 6, 1902, at 16. Source of original name The name Kanawha was probably selected by the original owner, Henry Huttleston Rogers. Among his many other activities, Rogers was an active investor and developer of West Virginia's coal lands and railroads in the area of the Kanawha River in the late 19th and early 20th century. The latter included the Kanawha and Pocahontas Railroad Company incorporated in 1898. Its line ran from the Kanawha River up a tributary called Paint Creek. Rogers negotiated its lease to the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O;) in 1901 and its sale to a newly formed C&O; subsidiary, Kanawha and Paint Creek Railway Company, in 1902. That same year, Rogers began investing with William Nelson Page in the Deepwater Railway, which was built south into new coal lands from Deepwater in Fayette County on the Kanawha River. US Navy service in World War I Kanawha was acquired in April 1917 by the U.S. Navy from her then owner, John Borden, and commissioned as USS Kanawha II (SP–130) under Borden's command. She was placed into service as an escort for Allied convoys traveling across the dangerous North Atlantic Ocean. Later renamed Piqua, she attacked a German U-boat off the coast of France and drove it off. Following the end of hostilities she was returned to her pre-war owner in July 1919. Black Star Line The final chapter in the life of the Kanawha was as unusual as the way it had started. The Black Star Line was a shipping line incorporated by Marcus Garvey, who organized the United Negro Improvement Association (UNIA). The Black Star Line derived its name from the White Star Line, another shipping line whose success Garvey felt he could duplicate, which would become a standard of his Back-to-Africa movement. Unfortunately for Garvey and his efforts, the ships he purchased beginning in 1919 were apparently both overpriced and in poor condition. Among these was the once-grand and well-maintained Kanawha. It was noted that Dr. Washington, the late educator, had been an honored guest aboard the ship years earlier. Renamed by the Black Star Line the S.S. Antonio Maceo, after putting in for unplanned repairs at Norfolk, it blew a boiler and killed a man off the Virginia coast on its first voyage from New York to Cuba, and had to be towed back to New York. The Black Star Line stopped sailing in February 1922, and was soon out of business.

In the mid-90s, he founded the Hip-Hop group Aroma with Menzel and Philipp Grüthering which was the predecessor of the progressive group Deichkind. However, Brosch and Menzel decided against a career as active artists and founded the production-groupd Island Bros.. One of their first notable projects was the single Electrosonic which they released under the pseudonym Amp at Universal Music together with Klaus Schulze in 1997. The success of their single provided them the opportunity to work at Herbert Böhme's Boogiepark Studios. Together with Andreas \\"Boogieman\\" Herbig, they produced remixes for renowned artists like Brandy, Joy Denalane, Lionel Richie, Enrique Iglesias, Liberty X, Inessa, Phil Collins or Lil' Kim. Subsequently, Boogieman and Island Bros. merged into Boogie Bros., however Menzel and Brosch still produced artists like Olesoul on their own. Beginning with 2002, Brosch went new ways, now mainly producing together with Roland Spremberg and Kim Sanders. Well-known results of their collaboration are songs like Fiesta by Vanessa S. feat. Ferris MC, a remix of a Deichkind-song as well as several other songs and remixes for German artists like Hartmut Engler, Florence Joy and BAP. Moreover, Brosch wrote songs for and produced the German singer Ben.

Piñeyro own Aquafilms, a film production company in Argentina.  Biography  Piñeyro was born in Genoa, Italy, 1956. He graduated as a doctor and went on to become a pilot for airline service in 1988 in Argentina, where he worked at LAPA, becoming an experienced pilot (ATP certificate, Boeing 737 co-pilot, Saab 340 captain). Two months prior to the infamous LAPA flight 3142 crash, Piñeyro voiced his concerns about LAPA's safety policy. Following the plane crash, Piñeyro became somewhat of a public figure in retelling his experiences working at LAPA, which subsequently went out of service. Piñeyro, who had already acted in films five times, went on to star a sixth time in his directorial debut, Whisky Romeo Zulu in 2004 – a partially biographical film where he recounted his battle against LAPA's safety policy before the accident. The film was generally well received, and spun a sequel of sorts, Fuerza aérea sociedad anónima, a documentary that criticized the fact that in Argentina the air traffic is controlled by the Air Force. Following the film's release, the national government decided to separate the Argentine Air Force from commercial air traffic, which is now responsibility of the Secretary of Transport.

Passementerie (, ) or passementarie is the art of making elaborate trimmings or edgings (in French, passements) of applied braid, gold or silver cord, embroidery, colored silk, or beads for clothing or furnishings. The art of passementerie Styles of passementerie include the tassel, fringes (applied, as opposed to integral), ornamental cords, galloons, pompons, rosettes, and gimps as other forms. Tassels, pompons, and rosettes are point ornaments, and the others are linear ornaments. Overview Passemanterie workshop, Valencian Museum of Ethnology. Passementerie worked in white linen thread is the origin of bobbin lace,Montupet, Janine, and Ghislaine Schoeller: Lace: The Elegant Web, and passement is an early French word for lace.S.F.A. Caulfeild and B.C. Saward, The Dictionary of Needlework, 1885. Today, passementerie is used with clothing, such as the gold braid on military dress uniforms, and for decorating couture clothing and wedding gowns. They are also used in furniture trimming, such as the Centripetal Spring Armchair of 1849 and some lampshades, draperies, fringes and tassels. History left In the West, tassels were originally a series of windings of thread or string around a suspending string until the desired curvature was attained. Decades later, turned wooden moulds, which were either covered in simple wrappings or much more elaborate coverings called \\"satinings\\", were used. This involved an intricate binding of bands of filament silk vertically around the mould by means of an internal \\"lacing\\" in the bore of the mould. A tassel is primarily an ornament, and was at first the casual termination of a cord to prevent unraveling with a knot. As time went on, various peoples developed variations on this. In the 16th century, the Guild of Passementiers was created in France. In France practitioners of the art were called \\"passementiers\\", and an apprenticeship of seven years was required to become a master in one of the subdivisions of the guild. The Guild documented the art of passementerie. The tassel was its primary expression, but it also included fringes (applied, as opposed to integral), ornamental cords, galloons, pompons, rosettes, and gimps as other forms. Tassels, pompons, and rosettes are point ornaments; the others are linear ornaments. These constructions were varied and augmented with extensive ornamentations. These constructions were each assigned an idiosyncratic term by their French practitioners. The French widely exported their very artistic work, and at such low prices that no other nation developed a mature \\"trimmings\\" industry. Tassels and their associated forms changed style throughout the years, from the small and casual of Renaissance designs, through the medium sizes and more staid designs of the Empire period, and to the Victorian Era with the largest and most elaborate. In Scotland at the end of the 16th century some passementerie was made with inferior gold and silver thread which quickly tarnished. On 6 May 1593 the Duke of Lennox and his friends decided not to wear any passementerie for a year, especially \\"passements great or small, plain or 'a jour', bissets, lilykins, cordons, and fringes\\".Historical Manuscripts Commission, Appendix 4th Report: Mrs. Erskine Murray (London, 1874), p. 527. Passementerie with clothing was for a long time reserved for the elites as a sign of social distinction among royalty, aristocracy, religious, and military. Since the 18th century, the use became largely obsolete with the simplification of clothing. Periodically historic designs return to favour by Interior and Fashion Designers. The middle of the 20th century saw a marked decline in the production and range of these products. The latter part of the 20th century has seen a resurgence in interest partly led by the film industry's set designers and costumiers. European and American artisans specialising in hand-made products are increasing in number. ReferencesFurther reading *Picken, Mary Brooks, The Fashion Dictionary, Funk and Wagnalls, 1957.

The Chonos who often had a hostile relation with the Spanish kept the lake secret from them despite serving the Spanish as maritime pilots. Despite official discovery in 1945 the lake was already known to seafarers from Chiloé.

Enshrined kami The primary kami of Takekoma Inari Shrine is , traditionally identified as with Inari, and associated with agriculture, especially rice production. Secondary kami include , the goddess of food, and , the god of the five cereals. There are also several smaller subsidiary shrines within the shrine grounds. History The Takekoma Inari Shrine was established in 842 AD, reputedly by Ono no Takamura, the kokushi of Ōshū Province, as a branch of the famous Fushimi Inari Shrine south of Kyoto. The shrine is mentioned by the Heian period poet Nōin during the reign of Emperor Go-Reizei (1045-1068) and during the Sengoku period was awarded an estate by local warlord Date Tanemune. It continued to be supported by the Date clan of Sendai Domain through the end of the Edo period.

Retrieved January 5, 2020.The former Curator of Oceanic Archaeology in the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology, and director of that museum from 1999 to 2002, he is a member of the board of directors of the Bishop Museum. Early life Kirch was born in Honolulu, Hawaii and was raised in Manoa valley from 1950s to 1960s. At the age of 13, he became an intern to Yoshio Kondo, a Bishop Museum malacologist. While there, he was studying Linnaean taxonomy and helped curate his mentor's collection of Polynesian snail shells. At the time, despite his strong interest in snails, he already had a passion for archaeology. Seeing it, Kondo suggested him to work with Kenneth Emory, a renowned Polynesian archaeologist. Unfortunately, Emory refused on working with Kirch, so Kondo took him under his wing so that Kirch could spend the whole summer conducting archaeological digs of his own. A year later, securing the permission of a landowner and some help from his father, Kirch had dug out a three-by-three-foot test pit at Hālawa on Molokai. In the midden of the pit, he found bone and shell fragments, which he carefully assembled, counted and write up results on. The results made Emory furious, but Kondo insisted that Kirch did everything right and therefore deserves to go with him to the South Point's excavation site. Career After graduating from the Punahou School, he attended University of Pennsylvania and Yale University, from which he obtained Ph.D. in 1975. From 1975 to 1984 Kirch served on the staff of the Bernice P. Bishop Museum in Honolulu. Due to the research decline in mid-1980s, Kirch relocated to Seattle, Washington, in 1984, where he was a director of the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture at the University of Washington and then became its associate professor. In 1989, he moved to California, where he took a position at the University of California, Berkeley, in the department of anthropology. He later took a joint appointment in the Department of Integrative Biology. His research focused on the archaeology, ethnography, and paleoecology of the Pacific Islands. He carried out original field research in Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, the Loyalty Islands, Kingdom of Tonga, American Samoa, Yap, Belau, the Marshall Islands, the Cook Islands, French Polynesia (Mangareva, Mo'orea), and Hawai'i. Kirch retired from the Berkeley faculty in July 2014, becoming chancellor's professor emeritus and Class of 1954 Professor Emeritus of Anthropology and Integrative Biology. He is currently a professor in the department of anthropology at the University of Hawai'i, Manoa. https://anthropology.manoa.hawaii.edu/pat-kirch/ He was one of the founders and the first president of the Society for Hawaiian Archaeology. In 2017 he was appointed to the board of directors of the Bishop Museum. He is a member of the advisory board of the Hawaiian Islands Land Trust, advising on the preservation of cultural sites. https://anthropology.manoa.hawaii.edu/pat- kirch/ His international collaborations include work with the Australian National University, the University of Auckland and University of Otago (New Zealand), and the University of French Polynesia (Tahiti). He is a member of the International Center for Archaeological Research on Polynesia, based at the University of French Polynesia. As a member of the U. S. National Academy of Sciences, he served as a liaison to the Pacific Science Association. Through his work, he has come to the belief that practitioners of archaeology, historical linguistics, human genetic studies, ethnology, and archival historical research can work together to give a fuller picture of the past than any discipline alone could do. Awards and honors In 1997 Kirch was awarded the John J. Carty Award from the National Academy of Sciences and in 2011 became recipient of the Herbert E. Gregory Medal for Distinguished Service to Pacific Science from the Pacific Science Association. He is also a Doctor Honoris Causa of the University of French Polynesia (2016). Kirch's research was recognized by the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society.

Firefighters said that the fire was estimated to be burning about two hours in the enclosed library before being discovered around 6:49 A.M by a custodian. The Police Captain confirmed that there was a break-in at the school. The arson remains an unsolved case. The temperature was estimated to be 2,000 degrees that caused most of the damage and the doors were closed that kept the heat in and caused the third floor to sag into the library.

A Balinese name will have three parts: a title, a birth order name and a personal name.Geertz H. Images of Power: Balinese Paintings Made for Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead University of Hawaii Press, 1994 p. ix. Balinese people do not use a family name. Both boys and girls receive birth order name from a small typical group of names for each birth order position. These names may vary due to caste, regional customs and variations in the Balinese language between the north and the south of the island. Balinese people use the birth order name to refer to one another. As most Balinese are Hindus, many names will be of Sanskrit origin. Some people have traditional Balinese names. Tasya A birth order name is chosen from a few typical names according to the position of the child in the birth order of siblings. The people of Bali use the birth order name to refer to one another. The first born are named Wayan, Putu, Gede or for a girl, Ni Luh. Wayan is a Balinese name meaning \\"eldest\\". Second born children are named Made, Kadek, or Nengah. Made and Nengah mean madya or \\"middle\\". Kadek means \\"little brother\\" or \\"little sister\\". The third born is given the name Nyoman or Komang. These names may be shortened to \\"Man\\" and \\"Mang\\" respectively. Fourth born children are named Ketut. Ketut is often shortened to \\"Tut\\". If there is a fifth child in the family, he is often called Wayan Balik (meaning \\"Wayan again\\").Zajonc, R. B. (2001). The family dynamics of intellectual development. American Psychologist 56: 490–496, p. 490. Names according to caste The naming system allows a person to recognise another's caste. A person's caste, unlike in India, is relatively unimportant to the Balinese people. The idea of caste flowed into Balinese culture as close links with Hindu-Buddhist Java evolved. The inclusion of the caste may also have been due to Airlangga (991 1049), a half Balinese raja of the Kediri Kingdom. The naming system of the peasant farmers of Bali may have preceded the idea of the caste. The farmers included indigenous Balinese and very early Hindu-Buddhist missionaries and their followers. The farmers represented a caste level that in India, would be called Sudra. This \\"farmer caste\\" also used birth order names, perhaps to indicate inheritance. Sudra Beyond the birth order name, there are no special names to denote people from the Sudra caste. Those of the Sudra caste add an \\"I\\" (male) and \\"Ni\\" (female) in front of their names. For example, I Made Mangku Pastika is the governor of Bali. Wesya The Wesya is the trader and farmer caste. The Wesya once added \\"Ngakan\\", \\"Kompyang\\", \\"Sang\\", or \\"Si\\" before their name. However, most no longer do so due to assimilation into the Sudra. An example is Ngakan Gede Sugiarta Garjitha, a major general. Ksatria The Ksatria caste are the ruling and military elite in Hindu society. Some typical names of people of the Ksatria caste include: I Gusti Ngurah (male), I Gusti Ayu (female), Anak Agung (male), Anak Agung Ayu or Anak Agung Istri (female), Tjokorda which is sometimes abbreviated as Tjok (male), Tjokorda Istri (female), Ida I Dewa, Dewa Agung or I Dewa (male), and I Dewa Ayu, and Desak (female). The name Gusti literally means \\"leader\\" as members of the Ksatria were often families promoted from the farmer caste. The Ksatria often use birth order names. Sometimes the Kastria borrow the whole order of the farmer caste names, so it is possible to find a name like I Gusti Ketut Rajendra, indicating a male of the Wesya caste, fourth born, whose personal name is Rajendra. The word Agung means \\"great\\", or \\"prominent\\". The word Tjokorda is a conjunction of the Sanskrit words Tjoka and Dewa. It literally means \\"the foot of the Gods\\", and is awarded to the highest members of the aristocracy. Another typical name might be Anak Agung Rai, meaning a Ksatria, whose personal name means \\"the great one\\". It is more difficult to differentiate sexes by name alone among the Ksatria people, though personal names often tell, like Putra, or \\"prince\\", for a boy, and Putri, or \\"princess\\", for a girl. An example is Sri Aji Kresna Kepakisan (reign 1352 CE 1380 CE}}. Other examples are I Gusti Ngurah Rai, military commander and national hero, Ide Anak Agung Gde Agung, former Indonesian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Tjokorda Gde Raka Soekawati, president of the State of East Indonesia, Dewa Made Beratha, a former Governor of Bali. Brahmana The Brahmin caste are academics, intellectuals, economists, aristocrats and lawyers. Names for the Brahmana caste include Ida Bagus (male), Ida Ayu (female). A typical name might be Ida Ayu Ngurah, meaning \\"Brahman woman, Beautiful highness whose personal name is Ngurah,\\" (in English, \\"gift from heaven\\"). Other examples are Ida Ayu Oka Rusmini, novelist and Ida Bagus Oka, a former governor of Bali. Inter-caste marriages occur. Those who marry someone from a higher caste will adopt the name Jero (\\"come in\\") in front of their name. Gender A name may have a prefix to indicate gender, I for males and Ni for females. Typical names are. for example, I Wayan Pedjeng (first-born male whose personal name is \\"moon\\") or Ni Ketut Sulastri (fourth- born female whose personal name is \\"fine light\\"). Unlike Javanese names, Balinese names of Sanskrit origin do not experience vowel change from a to o (as in Javanese Susilo, from Susila).

He is mentioned as the first king in a list of royals in a Satavahana inscription at Nanaghat. In the Puranas, the name of the first Andhra (Satavahana) king is variously spelt as Shivmukha, Sishuka, Sindhuka, Chhismaka, Shipraka, Srimukha, etc. These are believed to be corrupted spellings of \\"Simuka\\", resulting from copying and re-copying of manuscripts. Based on available evidence, Simuka cannot be dated with certainty. According to one theory, he lived in 3rd century BCE; but he is generally thought to have lived in the 1st century BCE. Epigraphical evidence strongly suggests a 1st century BCE date for Simuka: Simuka seems to be mentioned as the father the acting king Satakarni in the Naneghat inscription dated to 70-60 BCE, itself considered on palaeographical grounds to be posterior to the Nasik Caves inscription of Kanha (probably Simuka's brother) in Cave 19, dated to 100-70 BCE.Empires: Perspectives from Archaeology and History by Susan E. Alcock p.168 Recent analysis of sources puts Simuka´s reign possibly around 120 - 96 BCE.Ollett, Andrew, (2017). Language of the Snakes: Prakrit, Sanskrit, and the Language Order of Premodern India, University of California Press, Okland, (Table 2, Appendix A), p. 189. According to the Puranic lists of future kings, \\"137 years after the accession of Chandragupta Maurya, the Sungas will rule for 112 years and then the Kanvayanas for 45 years whose last king Susharman will be killed by the Andhra Simuka\\". If the accession of Chandragupta Maurya is dated to 324 BCE, then Simuka started to rule 294 years later, in 30 BCE.  Period  The Naneghat inscription. Dated to 70-60 BCE, it mentions reigning king Satakarni I, his queen Naganika, and his probable father, the \\"illustrious\\"\\" Simuka. Simuka is mentioned as the first king in a list of royals in a Satavahana inscription at Naneghat. The various Puranas have different names for the founder of the Andhra dynasty: Shishuka in Matsya Purana, Sipraka in Vishnu Purana, Sindhuka in Vayu Purana, Chhesmaka in Brahmanda Purana, and Shudraka or Suraka in Kumarika Khanda of Skanda Purana. These are believed to be corrupted spellings of Simuka, resulting from copying and re-copying of manuscripts. The Matsya and Vayu Puranas mention that the first Andhra king overthrew the Kanva king Susharman (c. 40–30 BCE). Based on identification of Simuka with this king, some scholars believe that Simuka's reign started in 30 BCE. Scholars supporting this theory include D. C. Sircar, H. C. Raychaudhuri and others. The Matsya Purana mentions that the Andhra dynasty ruled for 450 years. It is known that the Satavahana rule continued till the beginning of the early 3rd century CE. Therefore, the beginning of the Satavahana rule can be dated to 3rd-2nd century BCE. In addition, Indica by Megasthenes (350 – 290 BCE) mentions a powerful tribe named \\"Andarae\\", whose king maintained an army of 100,000 infantry, 2,000 cavalry and 1,000 elephants. If Andarae is identified with the Andhras, this can be considered additional evidence of Satavahana rule starting in 3rd century BCE. According to this theory, Simuka was an immediate successor of the Mauryan emperor Ashoka (304–232 BCE). According to these scholars, the Kanva ruler Susharman was overthrown by a successor of Simuka. The Brahmanda Purana states: \\"the four Kanvas will rule the earth for 45 years; then (it) will again go to the Andhras\\". This indicates Satavahanas had been in power before the Kanvas subjugated them; the Kanva rule was ultimately overthrown by a Satavahana king. Scholars supporting this theory include A. S. Altekar, K. P. Jayaswal, V. A. Smith and others. According to Sudhakar Chattopadhyaya, Simuka was the person who revived the Satavahana rule after the Kanva interregnum, and thus a founder of the 'second' Satavahana dynasty; the compilers of the Puranas have confused his name with the founder of the original dynasty. According to Charles Higham, the coin-based evidence suggests that Simuka's reign ended sometime before 120 BCE. Himanshu Prabha Ray also dates Simuka to somewhere before 100 BCE, Andrew Ollett, in a recent analysis, regards the possible period of his reign as 120 - 96 BCE.Ollett, Andrew, (2017). Language of the Snakes: Prakrit, Sanskrit, and the Language Order of Premodern India, University of California Press, Okland, Table 2, Appendix A, p. 189.  Biography  Not much is known about Simuka. According to Jain legends, he adopted Jainism; but, in the last years of his life, he became a tyrant, for which he was deposed and killed. According to Puranas, last king of Kanva dynasty was killed and succeeded by first king of Andhra dynasty (or Satavahana dynasty). According to the Puranas: \\"The Andhra Simuka will assail the Kanvayanas and Susarman, and destroy the remains of the Sungas' power and will obtain this earth.\\" He is named as Balipuccha is some texts. Simuka was succeeded by his brother Kanha, who further extended the empire westward at least as far as Nashik, where an inscription in the name of Kanha is known. According to Matsya Purana, Krishna (that is, Kanha) was succeeded by Mallakarni, but according to other Puranas, he was succeeded by Satakarni. The Naneghat cave inscription of Satakarni lists his family members: it mentions Simuka's name, but not that of Kanha. Based on this, historians conclude that Satakarni was Simuka's son, and succeeded Kanha.

It is of uncertain date but most likely was built in the 15th or early 16th century. Name The name probably derives from Baile na leachan (town of the flagstones/tombstones/stones) or Beal Áth na Leacha (ford-mouth of the flagstones). Location It is located in the region known as the Burren on a limestone outcrop overlooking the roads from Lisdoonvarna to Fanore and Doolin. Below the castle lies the intersection of R477 and R479 roads. History Ballinalacken Castle in the late 19th century, with the residence and later castle hotel on the left Given the prominent position, it is likely that the location was used for previous fortifications, but no traces of such are visible today. In the late 14th century, Lochlan MacCon O'Connor reportedly built a fortress at the site. The current tower house resembles Leamaneh Castle in that it was constructed over a prolonged period. The oldest part is the tall eastern tower, likely built in the 15th century. In 1564 the O'Connors lost their territory and in 1584/5 the castle was formally ceded to Sir Turlough O'Brien. Following the 1641 rebellion and subsequent Cromwellian reorganization, Turlough's son Daniel petitioned the English Commission in 1654 to save the house from demolition. Either he or his son, Teigue, eventually built the expansion at Ballinalacken. Teigue's son in turn, Donough, styled himself \\"of Ballyneleackan\\". The house remained in the possession of the Ennistymon O'Briens until the middle of the 18th century, when it passed to a different branch of the family. The Ballinalacken O'Briens trace their descent from Turlough Don who died in 1528, and also from the Ennistymon branch of the O'Briens, which was founded by Sir Donald O'Brien of Dough Castle (Lahinch) who died in 1579. In 1641-2 it was held by Daniel O'Brien of Dough and in 1654 a Cromwellian officer ordered the castles of Dough and Ballinalacken to be preserved from the dismantling of fortifications. In the 1667 Act of Settlement a Captain Hamilton became owner, but the O'Briens regained possession. The O'Briens were one of the most powerful families in Ireland at the time and built several castles - of which Ballinalacken is one. In 1837 its owner was planning to repair it. The bow fronted bungalow-type Ballinalacken Castle Hotel was built in the 1840s as the home of Lord O'Brien. It likely was built by John O'Brien MP (died 1855), eldest son of James and Margaret O'Brien. Being widowed in 1806, Margaret married Cornelius O'Brien. John was the father of Peter O'Brien. The house features a marble fireplace carved from a single slab and a circular, centre- roof window. There are also some original stained-glass windows and an O'Brien stone crest. The residence became a guest house in 1938. Description The castle is surrounded by a bawn, entered through a corbelled, machicolated gate. The tower house itself seems to have been constructed in two sections, later connected. The narrower and one storey taller eastern wing has the doorway with a top machicolation. A porter's lodge faces the circular stairs from which three floors of bedrooms are accessed, lit by small windows. The top floor gives access to a wall walk. The main wing features a finely-carved Tudor chimney (dated 1641). Machicolations in this wing contain several musket holes.

History The North Industrial district was considered Saskatoon's northern gateway when development began in the 1950s and 1960s (there had been an earlier attempt at an industrial subdivision to the northeast called Factoria that had been unsuccessful). Development of the area began to accelerate in the 1960s with the development of Circle Drive, which incorporated the area's southern boundary, 42nd Street. Construction of Circle Drive facilitated the opening up of North Industrial to development, although the bridge and northeast leg of the freeway wasn't constructed until the early 1980s. One popular destination for Saskatonians in the 1960s was the Skyway Drive-In, which remained open until the mid-1970s and was located north of Circle Drive or at the SE quarter of Section 34, Twp. 28, Range 24, Meridian W3. Presently if it was still existing it would be just north of 44th Street between Faithfull Avenue and Northridge Drive. Development of the Circle Drive ring road resulted in 42nd Street being renamed Circle Drive in the mid-1960s, though it is still common to hear longtime residents using the old name (and, by association, the Circle Drive Bridge to the east is often called the \\"42nd Street Bridge\\"). Despite being connected to a freeway, the old 42nd Street segment continues to be used as of 2015 as a commercial arterial road, with assorted strip malls and big box retailers. In the early 1980s, an attempt at purchasing the St. Louis Blues National Hockey League franchise included plans to develop a hockey arena in North Industrial, north of the Skyway Drive-In site. After the deal was rejected by NHL commissioners, plans for the new arena also stalled; eventually another site in nearby Agri-Place was chosen and Saskatchewan Place (now Credit Union Centre) was built.

This film version stars Rosalind Russell and was directed by Morton DaCosta. Not to be confused with a musical version of the story, that appeared on Broadway in 1966, and was later made into a 1974 film Mame starring Lucille Ball as the title character. Plot Patrick Dennis (Jan Handzlik), orphaned in 1928 when his father unexpectedly dies, is placed in the care of Mame Dennis (Rosalind Russell), his father's sister in Manhattan. Mame is a flamboyant and exuberant woman, who hosts frequent parties with eclectic, bohemian guests. Patrick is quickly introduced to his aunt's free- spirited and eccentric friends, including Vera Charles (Coral Browne), a Broadway actress, who spends many of her nights passed out drunk in Mame's guest room, Acacius Page (Henry Brandon), who runs a nudist school, and Lindsay Woolsey (Patric Knowles), a book publisher. Mame's frequently repeated motto, as heard later in the film, is \\"Life is a banquet, and most poor suckers are starving to death!\\" As Patrick's father was a wealthy man at the time of his death, Patrick's inheritance comes with a trustee, Dwight Babcock (Fred Clark), who disapproves of Mame's lifestyle (as did her brother, Edwin) and wants to interject discipline in Patrick's life. Mame has Patrick enrolled at Mr. Page's school. Mr. Babcock insists that Patrick be enrolled at Bixby's, a nearby boy's prep school. When he learns that Mame has not enrolled Patrick at Bixby's and instead as Mr. Page's school, he orders that Patrick go to his alma mater, St. Boniface's in Massachusetts and Mame will only see him at the holidays and during the summer. When Mame's investments are lost in the stock market crash of 1929, she takes a series of jobs—stage acting, telephone operator, sales girl at Macy's—that all end disastrously. At her sales job at Macy's, she meets a man named Beauregard Jackson Pickett Burnside (Forrest Tucker), a rich oil man from the South. He's immediately smitten with her, and she falls in love with him as well. Though she almost gets killed by Beau's betrothed (Brook Byron), he proposes to her at his estate in Georgia. For their honeymoon, they travel around the world. Through Mame's correspondence with Patrick, she senses that the now-grown Patrick (Roger Smith) is growing into a conventional man. After Beau dies by falling down a glacier while they are climbing the Matterhorn, Mame comes home (after spending 10 months visiting the places she had been with Beau). Patrick surprises her by installing a dictaphone, typewriter, and a secretary, Agnes Gooch (Peggy Cass). He and her friends persuade her to write her autobiography. Patrick and Lindsay arrange for a collaborator (and ghost writer) for Mame, Brian O'Bannion (Robin Hughes). He is initially charming, but it soon becomes clear that O'Bannion is a hack and is using Mame as a meal ticket. Patrick announces that he has a girlfriend, Gloria Upson (Joanna Barnes), and wants to bring her over to meet Mame, but he cautions Mame to act responsibly while Gloria is there. She calls him beastly and he almost leaves, but at the last minute Mame says she will do whatever he wants to make him and Gloria happy. Patrick leaves to bring Gloria. Meanwhile, O'Bannion insists Mame accompany him to a party to meet movie producers interested in Mame's autobiography. Mame instead dresses up the dowdy Agnes and tells O'Bannion that Agnes is an heiress merely doing secretarial work for \\"literary experience\\". O'Bannion's greed kicks in, and he escorts Agnes to the party in Mame's place. When Agnes returns the next day, she is disheveled and remembers very little of her night with O'Bannion—only that she drank heavily and thinks she saw a movie with a wedding scene in it. Patrick brings Gloria over, but Mame is horrified to see she is nothing more than a spoiled rich girl. Against Patrick's wishes, she goes to visit Gloria's family in a \\"restricted\\" community in Connecticut called Upson Downs, where they express anti-Semitic views. Her parents (Lee Patrick and Willard Waterman), although outwardly friendly, are just like Gloria. Mame arranges a dinner party at her apartment and she invites Gloria, her parents, and a few of her own friends. On the night of the party, Patrick meets Pegeen (Pippa Scott), Mame's new secretary; Agnes is now several months pregnant due to her night with O'Bannion. Everything about the evening is a carefully planned disaster: the food, the drink, the furniture, and the company. Lindsay surprises the attendees with the galleys from Mame's autobiography. The release of the book prompts a telegram from O'Bannion demanding his collaborative efforts be rewarded and declaring that his wife Agnes can substantiate his claims. The ribald content leads Gloria to insult the other attendees. Patrick defends them, attacking Gloria's friends instead. Mame then reveals that she bought the lot behind Upson Downs, to make a home for refugee Jewish children. The Upsons, and later Mr. Babcock, leave in a huff. Several years later, when Patrick and Pegeen are married, their son, Michael, wants to travel with Mame on her trip to India. The two of them wear down Patrick and Pegeen's objections, and the movie fades away as Mame tells Michael of all the wondrous sights they will see.

Rosalind Russell originated the role of Mame and was nominated for the 1957 Tony award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play. She played Mame until January 20, 1958, when Greer Garson took over the part. Russell, Peggy Cass and January Handzlik reprised their Broadway roles in the film. According to TCM, Variety reported at the time that “risqué language and 'gamier aspects' of Dennis' novel, which remained in the stage play, were 'toned down' for the film and 'suggested rather than stated.' The Variety review mentioned that at least one scene written for the film was excised in the final editing.”As of September 18, 2020, the original review is not available on Variety's website. The Motion Picture Herald Product Digest review observed that the film \\"provided a unique means of establishing time and plot progression\\" through the changing decor of Mame's Beekman Place apartment. A June 1958 Los Angeles Examiner article named six different styles: Chinese, 1920s Modern, “Syrie Maugham” a French style named for writer Somerset Maugham's wife; English, Danish Modern and East Indian. When the Upsons visit Mame, they run afoul of the Danish Modern furniture, which is equipped with lifts. The film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Art Direction (Art Direction: Malcolm Bert; Set Decoration: George James Hopkins). The costume design for the film, which includes outfits for Mame that coordinate with those sets, was provided by Orry-Kelly, who had worked with Rosalind Russell on a number of films. New York Times critic Bosley Crowther observed: “The lavish décor of Mame's apartment is changed almost as frequently as are her flashy costumes, and all of them are dazzling, in color and on the modified wide-screen.” Rosalind Russell broke her ankle on the first take of a scene where she runs down the stairs. Filming was delayed until she recovered. Several online sources, including Rotten Tomatoes' and AllMovie's biographies of actor and journalist Joanna Barnes , mistakenly describe Gloria Upson as “Vassar educated”. Gloria is “an Upper Richman Girls School girl”, and proud of it. She does not understand the concept of a college major, but proclaims that the school is “top drawer.” In 2008, in The Seattle Weekly, Gavin Borchert described the character succinctly as a “lockjawed prep princess“. On AllMovie, Hal Erickson adds that the character “spoke as though she had novacaine in her upper lip (the playwrights' description of the character)“. The moment she opened her mouth, Gloria's exaggerated mid-Atlantic accent spoke volumes to the 1958 audience, identifying her as a privileged WASP. Reception Rosalind Russell drew wide praise for her performance. In an article describing why Turner Classic Movies has named it one of “The Essentials.” Andrea Passafiume observes that the role transformed Russell's career, “first on the Broadway stage and then on the big screen. Having long been a top level movie star throughout the 1930s and 40s, Russell's career in Hollywood was dwindling as she settled into middle age. The role of Mame Dennis... gave her the chance to be glamorous and showcase her sharp comedic talents, which reminded the world that she was still a vital force to be reckoned with. The success of the play made her the toast of Broadway, and the hit film gave her her first Oscar® nomination as Best Actress in more than a decade”. Passafiume adds that the film also transformed Warner Bros. Studios, which was “desperate for a hit, having suffered through a string of recent disappointments which put the once thriving studio increasingly in the red. Auntie Mame was the answer to their prayers and helped restore the studio's former glory.” Auntie Mame became the second highest-grossing film of 1958, earning a net profit of $8,800,000. When a film is released late in a calendar year (October to December), its income is reported in the following year's compendium, unless the film made a particularly fast impact (p. 17) Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote that \\"for all its absurd exaggerations and bland inconsistencies, this picture of a tireless party-giver is a highly entertaining thing to see. And, because of the gags that gush from it, it is a constantly amusing thing to hear. Variety called the film \\"a faithfully funny recording of the hit play, changed only in some small details to conform to motion picture mores ... Rosalind Russell recreates the title role for the film and re-establishes herself as a top picture personality.\\" The trade journal Harrison's Reports called the film \\"a fast and furious comedy, with a glamorous background and considerable deep human appeal ... Rosalind Russell, who scored a huge success in the stage play, repeats her wonderful performance as the uninhibited heroine in this screen version. She fits the role so ideally that it is difficult to imagine any one else in the part.\\" Richard L. Coe of The Washington Post called the film \\"broad as the Atlantic, too broad for me, but it's still a hilarious, observant comedy ... Miss Russell remains just plain wonderful in the part.\\" John McCarten of The New Yorker dismissed the film, writing that Russell \\"works hard,\\" but that the film \\"bogs down badly before it has gone any distance.\\" The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote that the film was \\"virtually a one- woman revue, a series of turns—Mame as hostess, shopgirl, telephone operator, counterfeit Southern Belle, writer, actress—carried along on a strong current of personality. Rosalind Russell, who created the part on the stage, takes a turn or two to get into her stride; once established, however, her superbly confident timing and powerfully empathic comedy personality see her happily through.\\" Leonard Maltin gives the film 3.5 out of 4 stars: “ Episodic but highly entertaining, sparked by Russell's tour-de-force performance.” As of September 2020, Auntie Mame has a score of 93% on the review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 14 out of 15 surveyed critics giving the film a positive review.

ATR belongs to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase protein family. ATR is activated in response to single strand breaks.  Function  ATR is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase that is involved in sensing DNA damage and activating the DNA damage checkpoint, leading to cell cycle arrest. ATR is activated in response to persistent single-stranded DNA, which is a common intermediate formed during DNA damage detection and repair. Single-stranded DNA occurs at stalled replication forks and as an intermediate in DNA repair pathways such as nucleotide excision repair and homologous recombination repair. ATR works with a partner protein called ATRIP to recognize single-stranded DNA coated with RPA. Once ATR is activated, it phosphorylates Chk1, initiating a signal transduction cascade that culminates in cell cycle arrest. In addition to its role in activating the DNA damage checkpoint, ATR is thought to function in unperturbed DNA replication. ATR is related to a second checkpoint-activating kinase, ATM, which is activated by double strand breaks in DNA or chromatin disruption.  Clinical significance  Mutations in ATR are responsible for Seckel syndrome, a rare human disorder that shares some characteristics with ataxia telangiectasia, which results from ATM mutation. ATR is also linked to familial cutaneous telangiectasia and cancer syndrome.  Inhibitors  ATR/ChK1 inhibitors can potentiate the effect of DNA cross-linking agents such as cisplatin and nucleoside analogues such as gemcitabine. The first clinical trials using inhibitors of ATR have been initiated by AstraZeneca, preferably in ATM-mutated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), prolymphocytic leukaemia (PLL) or B-cell lymphoma patients and by Vertex Pharmaceuticals in advanced solid tumours. Examples include * Berzosertib Aging Deficiency of ATR expression in adult mice leads to the appearance of age-related alterations such as hair graying, hair loss, kyphosis (rounded upper back), osteoporosis and thymic involution. Furthermore, there are dramatic reductions with age in tissue-specific stem and progenitor cells, and exhaustion of tissue renewal and homeostatic capacity. There was also an early and permanent loss of spermatogenesis. However, there was no significant increase in tumor risk. Seckel syndrome In humans, hypomorphic mutations (partial loss of gene function) in the ATR gene are linked to Seckel syndrome, an autosomal recessive condition characterized by proportionate dwarfism, developmental delay, marked microcephaly, dental malocclusion and thoracic kyphosis. A senile or progeroid appearance has also been frequently noted in Seckel patients. Homologous recombinational repair Somatic cells of mice deficient in ATR have a decreased frequency of homologous recombination and an increased level of chromosomal damage. This finding implies that ATR is required for homologous recombinational repair of endogenous DNA damage. Drosophila mitosis and meiosis Mei-41 is the Drosophila ortholog of ATR. During mitosis in Drosophila DNA damages caused by exogenous agents are repaired by a homologous recombination process that depends on mei-41(ATR). Mutants defective in mei-41(ATR) have increased sensitivity to killing by exposure to the DNA damaging agents UV , and methyl methanesulfonate. Deficiency of mei-41(ATR) also causes reduced spontaneous allelic recombination (crossing over) during meiosis suggesting that wild-type mei-41(ATR) is employed in recombinational repair of spontaneous DNA damages during meiosis.

Plot synopsis Hawkeye and Charles start a rumor that Marilyn Monroe will be visiting the 4077th but find themselves in hot water when people start to believe it, including Col. Potter. They desperately try to arrange for Marilyn to appear, with Hawkeye going so far as to try to contact her by phone pretending to be Ted Williams. However, they are ultimately unsuccessful, and end up having to send a faked telegram purportedly from Marilyn apologizing for not being able to appear. Meanwhile, B.J. has a chopper pilot take him out on a fishing trip. On the flight, they encounter a wounded soldier. B.J. throws the soldier a rope to haul him up into the helicopter, but at that moment the chopper is besieged by enemy fire. At the pilot's frantic behest, B.J. ends up cutting the rope and abandoning the wounded man as the chopper flies off. The pilot is impressed by B.J.'s valiant attempt to save the soldier and recommends him for a commendation; shortly thereafter, B.J. is notified he is to receive the Bronze Star. Far from gratified, B.J. is disgusted with himself for putting his own welfare first and possibly leaving a wounded man to die; he also remarks that he can no longer consider himself morally superior to those he operated on: \\"The minute I cut that line they made me a soldier.\\" He eventually gives the medal to another patient. Gerald S. O'Loughlin guest stars as General Franklin Schwerin. Analysis This episode has been held up as an example of the changing sociopolitical views embodied by its characters, in this instance from more to less anti-authoritarian.

By 1984, Gerry Bron's Bronze Records were in financial difficulty leading to a hiatus in recording activity for Motörhead. Eventually, Motörhead managers Douglas Smith and Dave Simmons bought the band out of their contract and Bron subsequently sold the Bronze Records rights onto Legacy Records owner Ray Richards. Richards then contacted Smith with a proposal for a joint venture to release new product by Motörhead, leading to the formation of GWR Records (named after Smith's business address of 15 Great Western Road). In addition to Motörhead, the label mainly released product by acts associated with Smith, such as Girlschool, Fastway, Hawkwind, Tank, Atomgods and Anti-Nowhere League, and bands from the thrash metal scene. By 1992, Smith had been ousted as a managing director of the company and the label's catalogue was absorbed into Castle Communications, which later became part of Sanctuary Records Group.

In the 11th century, Polish ruler Władysław Herman built a church of St. Giles at the site.Tadeusz Pietrykowski, Z przeszłości Kcyni z okazji 666 rocznicy założenia miasta, Kcynia, 1928, p. 16 (in Polish) In 1255 Kcynia was owned by Duke of Greater Poland Przemysł I. His brother, Duke Bolesław the Pious, in 1262 granted Kcynia town rights along with privileges similar to those enjoyed by Poznań and Gniezno.Słownik geograficzny Królestwa Polskiego i innych krajów słowiańskich, Tom III, Warszawa, 1882, p. 947 (in Polish) Kcynia was a royal town of the Polish Crown and a county seat in the Kalisz Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Polish Crown.Pietrykowski, p. 27 The coat of arms of Kcynia depicts the white eagle of Greater Poland.Pietrykowski, p. 18-19 Kcynia suffered a fire in 1441. The town had defensive walls and a castle, which was the seat of local starosts (local royal administrators). In 1594 Polish King Sigismund III Vasa visited the town, while returning from Sweden. From 1768 Kcynia was part of the newly established Gniezno Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province. Kcynia was annexed by Prussia in the First Partition of Poland in 1772. In 1807 it became part of the short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw, and in 1815 it was re-annexed by Prussia. During the Greater Poland uprising (1848), it was the site of the , in which Polish insurgents won against the Prussians. In 1913, the town had a population of 4,000, including 3,000 Roman Catholics, 800 Protestants, and 200 Jews. The populace took part in the Greater Poland uprising (1918–19), and Kcynia was soon restored to reborn Poland. During World War II, Kcynia was under German occupation from 1939 to 1945. The Germans carried out massacres and expulsions of Poles to the General Government. In December 1939 and August 1940, Germans expelled Polish intelligentsia with their families, as well as owners of better houses, workshops and shops, which were then handed over to German colonists as part of the Lebensraum policy.Maria Wardzyńska, Wysiedlenia ludności polskiej z okupowanych ziem polskich włączonych do III Rzeszy w latach 1939-1945, IPN, Warszawa, 2017, p. 178, 240 (in Polish) Further expulsions were carried out in February 1941.Wardzyńska, p. 301 In 1939, the Jewish synagogue was destroyed by the Germans.

Education and family life Born on October 28, 1774, at \\"Castle Woods\\" in Botetourt County in the Virginia Colony, to the former Jane Black (1751-1801) and her husband the patriot Major John Boyle (1750-1824). Boyle had an elder brother Alexander, and four sisters who also survived to adulthood. Their father moved his family to Whitleys Station, Kentucky in 1779, upon receiving land for his patriotic service, where his sons were educated by private tutors and in private schools. Although his elder brother continued as a farmer in Garrard County (moving to Lincoln County, Kentucky after the Civil War), John Boyle then read law with Congressman Thomas Terry Davis and was admitted to the Kentucky bar in 1797. John Boyle married Elizabeth Tilford (1781-1833), and they had ten children, the first four of whom failed to survive their parents. Their eldest daughter Arethusa Jewell died in 1818 while visiting her parents' home after giving birth to their first and second grandchildren. Their eldest surviving son, James Madison Boyle (1809-1892), moved to Illinois, as did his youngest brother Henry Boyle (1821-1846) and longest surviving sister, Ellen B. Lagow McAllister (1816-1844). Son Marmontel Boyle (1811-1851) died in California. Only sons John Weir Boyle (1815-1845) and Jeremiah Tilford Boyle (1818-1871) remained in Kentucky, the last following his father's example and becoming a lawyer and politician before his Civil War service.findagrave no. 72201873 Boyle genealogy p. 59  Early career  Boyle began his private legal practice in Lancaster, Garrard County, Kentucky in 1797 and continued until 1802. His political connections also secured for him a post as deputy counselor at law for the Kentucky Court of Quarter Sessions in 1797. Boyle won his first elective office in 1800, representing Garrard County in the Kentucky House of Representatives. He also farmed a plantation using enslaved labor.Boyle genealogy p. 56 Congressman In 1802, voters elected Boyle as a Democratic-Republican from Kentucky's 2nd congressional district to the United States House of Representatives, and later re-elected him, so he served in the 8th, 9th and 10th United States Congresses (from March 4, 1803 to March 3, 1809). Fellow Congressmen twice selected Boyle as one of the managers to conduct impeachment proceedings, first in January 1804 against Judge John Pickering, and, in December of the same year, against Associate Justice Samuel Chase. He was Chairman of the Committee on Public Land Claims for the 9th and 10th United States Congresses. Kentucky justice and dean Appointed Governor of the Illinois Territory in 1809, Boyle declined the position. Instead, Ninian Edwards, a seasoned politician and since 1806 Judge of Kentucky's highest court, the Court of Appeals was appointed the territory's governor. Boyle succeeded Edwards as a Kentucky appellate judge (having elected George M. Bibb as their chief), and soon his fellow judges elected Boyle as their chief. Thus, he served from 1809 to 1826, including as Chief Judge from 1810 to 1826. However, the last three years of his term were marked by the Old Court - New Court controversy, prompted by his 1823 decision invalidating debt relief laws enacted by the 1820 legislature. At midnight on December 23, 1824, the new legislature (also pro-debtor and which had elected former Congressman Joseph Desha as governor), appointed a new Court of Appeals with former Senator William T. Barry (who had argued one of the debt relief cases in 1823) as Chief Justice and John Trimble, James Haggin, Benjamin W. Patton and Rezin Davidge as associate judges (the \\"New Court\\").http://louisville.edu/law/library/justices-of- kentuckys-highest-court-the-court-of-appeals-1792-1975-supreme- court-1976-present Desha had campaigned for debt relief, since Kentucky was still suffering the effects of the Panic of 1819, and his party won majorities in both houses of the legislature, but could not find grounds to impeach Boyle and his two fellow judges. Instead, they purported to reorganize the judiciary. The legislature also refused to appropriate salaries for Boyle and his purportedly dismissed colleagues, although on December 24, 1826 the newly- elected legislature (dominated by the \\"Old Court\\" party) repealed the two-year old judicial reorganization act, restored the old judges (although Boyle had resigned on November 8, 1826, as discussed below) and awarded them backpay.Boyle genealogy pp. 53-56 Boyle would be succeeded briefly as Chief Judge by Bibb (whom he had also succeeded), then by former Congressman George Robertson (who had represented creditors in one of the controversial cases as well as succeeded to Boyle's house). On May 29, 1829, Boyle accepted the position of Dean of the Transylvania University law school, notwithstanding his federal service (as discussed below), although he only continued in that position for a year.Boyle genealogy p. 57 Federal district judge John Boyle's home in Lancaster, Kentucky. This home was at different times owned by Robert Letcher, U.S.Congressman and Kentucky Governor, and George Robertson, U.S.Congressman, and a judge of the Kentucky Court of Appeals. Boyle received a recess appointment from President John Quincy Adams on October 20, 1826, to a seat on the United States District Court for the District of Kentucky vacated by Judge Robert Trimble. He was nominated to the same position by President Adams on December 13, 1826. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on February 12, 1827, received his commission the same day, and continued as district judge until his death.  Death and legacy  Boyle died on January 28, 1834, near Danville, Boyle County, Kentucky, depressed following his wife's death in a cholera epidemic the preceding June, notwithstanding the presence of many of his children and grandchildren. He was interred beside her in Danville's Bellevue Cemetery. The double log cabin which he built in Lancaster, Kentucky remains today (as improved by his successors) and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, not only because of its age, but also because of its distinguished residents. Boyle sold the house to Samuel McKee, who had read law with him and who also succeeded Boyle in Congress. McKee in turn sold the house to George Robertson, whom he had guided in reading law and who succeeded McKee in Congress and later succeeded Boyle as Chief Justice of the Kentucky Supreme Court. Robertson in turn sold the house to Robert P. Letcher, who became a Congressman and Kentucky governor Boyle's legacy also included his lawyer son Jeremiah Boyle, who unsuccessfully argued for emancipation of slaves at Kentucky's Constitutional Convention of 1849, and later recruited troops and became a Brigadier General during the American Civil War, and thereafter became active in the booming railroad industryBoyle genealogy pp. 69-71 although some of Boyle's descendants would fight for the Confederacy. Furthermore, Judge Boyle taught law to his nephew John Boyle Gordon (the son of his young sister Jane who eloped), who moved to Missouri, where he served in the legislature for several terms, as well as taught law to relatives Oden Guitar and Stanley Matthews, who both became Union Army officers during the American Civil War, then became judges, Guitar in Missouri and Matthews on the United States Supreme Court.Boyle genealogy pp 105-106, 122-123 ReferencesExternal links History of the Sixth Circuit * 1774 births 1834 deaths Members of the Kentucky House of Representatives Judges of the Kentucky Court of Appeals Judges of the United States District Court for the District of Kentucky United States federal judges appointed by John Quincy Adams 19th-century American judges Members of the United States House of Representatives from Kentucky Politicians from Danville, Kentucky Kentucky Democratic-Republicans Democratic-Republican Party members of the United States House of Representatives People from Botetourt County, Virginia People from Lancaster, Kentucky United States federal judges admitted to the practice of law by reading law People from Russell County, Virginia ","title":"John Boyle (congressman)"},{"id":"9597607","text":"Sosicles was a Corinthian ambassador at the remarkable meeting of the allies of Sparta at around 500 BC, before which the Spartans laid their proposal for restoring Hippias to the tyranny of Athens.

This building has since been demolished and the current buildings reside at 140 N Bodmer Avenue. The first school building in the current location was built in 1912. A new high school was finished in 1939 some yards to the north of the old building. In 1957, two additions were opened, one linking the existing buildings, and the other housing new classrooms on the south end of the 1912 building. The older building housed K-6, a small gymnasium, and elementary school offices. The 1939 building housed 7-12. The connecting addition housed school district administrators, high school principal, a gymnasium, cafeteria, band rooms, industrial education, and art facilities. All these buildings were demolished by 2012. State and local funding was appropriated to construct new buildings just west of the old buildings. The first building opened in 2007. The second building, housing the high school and connected to the first building, opened in 2010 using funds from the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement.
