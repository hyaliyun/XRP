Early life and education  Dorothy Lamb was born in Manchester on October 4, 1887 to the mathematician Sir Horace Lamb and his wife Elizabeth. She was one of seven children, who included the painter Henry Lamb. She was educated at Manchester High School and Wycombe Abbey boarding school. She later attended Newnham College, Cambridge, where she read classics from 1906 to 1910 and graduating with honors. Encouraged by Jane Harrison, Lamb travelled to Greece and was accepted as a student of the British School at Athens from 1910 to 1911.  Archaeological career  In 1910 Lamb was in Athens working on a catalogue of the Greek terracotta figurines in the Acropolis Museum, a project the British School initiated on behalf of the Acropolis Museum. In 1911 she participated in excavations at Phylakopi on Melos. Lamb, Lillian Tennant and Hilda Lorimer were the first women to participate in an excavation conducted by the British School at Athens. The excavation, led by Richard Dawkins, the director of the British School, was conducted from March to May 1911, with Lamb and Tennant beginning fieldwork after 16 April. The project was a supplementary excavation of a site that had been explored in 1896‚Äì1899. The start of the First Balkan War in 1912 ended archaeological fieldwork plans in Greece. Lamb returned to England, first stopping in Paris to do additional research on the terracottas at the Louvre. She finished her work on her catalogue in 1912 and the first volume, edited by Guy Dickens, was published that year by Cambridge University Press. The British School's publications committee recommended revisions, so Lamb continued to work on the second volume of the Catalogue from 1912 to 1914. Later in 1912, Lamb travelled to the United States and spent a year lecturing on classical archaeology at Bryn Mawr College. From 1913 to 1914, as recipient of Newnham College's Mary Ewart Travelling Scholarship, Lamb returned to Athens to continue work on the revisions to her catalogue. During this time period she also traveled to Paris, Rome and Turkey, continuing her studies in classical archaeology and art. She also participated in the American Archaeological Expedition to Melas in Greece in 1913 and 1914. Although Lamb began a study of Islamic architecture in Konya between 1914 and 1916, the outbreak of the First World War \\"brought a promising academic career to an end\\". In 1916 Lamb was living in England working for the British government. She worked as an assistant in the Ministry of National Service (1916‚Äì1918) and the Ministry of Food (1918‚Äì1920). She then became secretary to the London Committee Supreme Economic Council. In 1919 she was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). Due to the war and the death of the Acropolis Museum catalogue's first editor Guy Dickens, the second volume was not published until 1921. After the war, Lamb no longer participated in fieldwork, but continued to research and write, with an edition of Private Letters in translation published in 1933, Pilgrims were they All in 1937, and other published work from the 1920s through to the 1940s that reflected her continuing interest in classical art and architecture.  Personal life  Lamb married Sir John Reeve Brooke in 1920. Brooke died in 1937, and in 1939 Lamb remarried to Sir Walter Frederick Nicholson. She was widowed again in 1946 and died in 1967.

The page gives descriptions and illustrations of seven comets, from a total of 29 found in the document.Loewe, pp. 62, 64 Chinese records of comets are the most extensive and accurate in existence from the ancient and medieval periods, and stretch back across three millennia. Records exist at least as far back as 613 BC, and records may have been kept for many centuries before this. There are continuous records all the way through to the nineteenth century, using substantially consistent methods throughout. Chinese data accuracy is unsurpassed in the ancient world and was not overtaken by Western accuracy until the fifteenth century or, in some respects, not until the twentieth century. Comets were observed in great detail because of their astrological significance. However, these observations are now of great use to modern astronomers. Their accuracy is sufficient to allow the calculation of orbital elements, and modern astronomers have done this for many comets. Most notably, ancient orbits of Halley's Comet have been determined using Chinese records, a feat not possible solely from modern data due to a close approach of the comet to Earth in the ninth century. Such close approaches cause comet orbits to change abruptly, and ancient changes of this sort cannot be accurately modelled from the comet's present-day orbital data. Chinese records Report of the 240 BC apparition of Halley's Comet from the Shiji (Âè≤Ë®ò) Ancient Chinese records of comet observations are the most extensive historical records in existence. They are far more complete than European observations.Needham, p.430 The earliest confirmed Chinese comet observation is from 613 BC,Stephenson and Yau, p. 30 but there is also a possible sighting of Halley's Comet in 1059 BC.Xu, Pankenier & Jiang, p. 107 However, this may not be an actual sighting, but the result of later back calculation.Needham, p. 408 Early records call comets beixing (or boxing: , \\"bushy star\\" or \\"sparkling star\\"Yeomans, Rahe & Freitag, p. 71 according to Yeomans et al.). Later on, a distinction is made between beixing and huixing (, \\"broom star\\"), that is, comets without, and with a tail respectively. The broomstick here is a metaphor for the tail and the broomhead the head of the comet. Chinese astronomers were the first to observe that comet tails point away from the sun. They knew this by at least 635 AD, many centuries before the phenomenon was observed in the West. Other descriptive Chinese names for comet include saoxing (ÊéÉÊòü, \\"sweeping star\\"), tianchan (Â§©Êîô, \\"heavenly intermingler\\"), fengxing (ÁØ∑Êòü, \\"sailing star\\"), changxing (Èï∑Êòü, \\"long star\\"), and zhuxing (Áá≠Êòü, \\"candle-flame star\\"). The Chinese records are not only the most extensive from ancient times, they are also the most accurate, often to within half a degree of right ascension. Western measurements did not overtake them for accuracy until the fifteenth century: in 1456 AD Paolo Toscanelli tracked the progress of Halley's Comet to within a fraction of a degree. Finding the time of a Chinese observation is a little more problematic. This can be very important for fast moving objects like comets. However, the dates are recorded, and the time can be estimated to within one or two hours by considering when the Chinese observers would have had good viewing conditions.Stephenson & Yau, p. 32 Comets that actually have a tail can be described as beixing when they are in opposition and the tail is not visible, giving a further clue.Needham, p. 431 Chinese records of comet brightness are superior to Western observations to an even later date. The West did not overtake Chinese astronomers in this respect until the twentieth century, at least in the matter of diligent recording of brightnesses. List of records The following documents contain substantial comet observations. Many other local documents have useful information and have been incorporated into various compilations. =Early sources= * Spring and Autumn Annals, annals of the State of Lu, traditionally attributed to Confucius. * Records of the Grand Historian, the first comprehensive history of China, by Sima Qian. * Book of Wei, official history of the Wei dynasty. The book contains only summary information from the now lost official astronomer's records, but nevertheless has reasonably accurate information. =Compilations= An astronomical text recovered from Tomb no.3 in Mawangdui contains images and descriptions of 29 different comets. The descriptions often include the comet's name, notes about its apparition, and its associated portent, usually military,Loewe, pp 67‚Äì8 but lack detailed dates of the comets' sightings. This text can be solidly dated as being prior to 168 BC, the date assigned to the tomb. It may be associated with a similar astronomical text from the same tomb, which details planetary motions for the seventy years ending 177 BC.Loewe, p 65 Wenxian Tongkao, a thirteenth century compilation by Ma Duanlin, includes a list of comets up to 1222 AD. Various European authors used this list as a basis for their own lists starting with Antoine Gaubil who translated it from the Chinese and later extended the list to 1644 AD. The most complete European list was published by John Williams (1797‚Äì1874) in 1871. Williams' list contains 372 comets from 613 BC to 1621 AD. A Chinese compilation published in 1988, A Comprehensive Collection of Ancient Chinese Astronomical Records (Zhonguo gudai tianxiang jilu zongji), has over a thousand comet observations.Xu, Pankenier & Jiang, pp. 107, 109 Importance to modern astronomers The Chinese records have some importance to modern science because they allow astronomers to deduce the past orbits and brightnesses of comets. This is important because comet orbits are not always entirely regular. They can be changed by gravitational encounters with the planets. Without ancient records, such past changes would be very difficult to determine. A feature of the Chinese records that makes them particularly useful for modern scientists and scholars is that there is a high degree of consistency in the methods of observation and recording over a very long period. Chinese astronomers were still using naked eye observation in 1835, long after the invention of the telescope. Around forty comets have had their orbits calculated based entirely on ancient Chinese records. Of the well known comets, besides Halley, Brian G. Marsden suggested, based on Chinese and other ancient observations, that the Great Comet of 1106 was a previous apparition of Comet Ikeya‚ÄìSeki.Ho, p. 151 Ikeya‚ÄìSeki is a member of the Kreutz sungrazer family of comets. These are thought to all have originated from the break up of a large parent comet. Several previously unknown members of this group have been found in the Chinese records.Strom, p. L17 Halley's Comet Chinese observations of Halley's Comet are of especial importance to astronomers because of the important place this comet had in their growing understanding of them. The earliest confirmed sighting was in 240 BC (in the Records of the Grand Historian)Stephenson & Yau, p. 31‚Äîwith a continuous record after 164 BC.Yeomans, Rahe & Freitag, p. 62 A comet observed in 467 BC may have been Halley, but there is insufficient information to be sure. The most accurate records of Halley begin in 12 BC. In 1843 engineer and sinologist √âdouard Biot translated Chinese records of comets. Astronomer John Russell Hind observed that past apparitions of Halley back to 12 BC in most cases could be matched to these Chinese records. A computer calculation of the past orbits of Halley using numerical integrationYeomans & Kiang, 1981 could not continue past 837 AD because a very close approach to Earth made calculation of orbits prior to that too inaccurate. The researchers had started with accurate European measurements from 1759, 1682 and 1607 AD and calculated backwards. However, no accurate European records exist for 837 AD so the researchers looked to Chinese records. From these they obtained a good estimate of the perihelion of Halley for that year. They used that, together with perihelions found from Chinese data for 374 and 141 AD, to provide constraints for their calculation. They were finally able to calculate the orbits of Halley back to 1404 BC. Studies of historical changes in brightness of Halley's Comet have also been carried out using ancient Chinese data. There has been no regular recording of the brightness of Halley in the West prior to the 1910 apparition. The Chinese records, on the other hand, are almost complete from 12 BC to 1835 AD. Comets in Chinese astrology Ancient Chinese astrology set great store by celestial omens and comets were an important omen, always disastrous.Schafer, pp 108‚Äì9 Under the theory of Wu Xing, comets were thought to signify an imbalance of yin and yang.Needham, p. 32 Chinese emperors employed observers specifically to watch for them. Some important decisions were made as a result. For instance, Emperor Ruizong of Tang abdicated after a comet appearance in 712 AD. Comets were thought to have military significance. For instance, the breakup of a comet on 25 January 35 AD was interpreted as portending the destruction of Gongsun Shu by Wu Han, general to emperor Guangwu.Loewe, p. 83 References Bibliography Needham, Joseph, Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 3, Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth, Cambridge University Press, 1959 .

Cain has additionally gone on record to state, \\"Yes I mix religion and politics.\\". He has pledged as part of his 2020 campaign platform to protect the \\"guarantee of religious liberty\\", as well as \\"ensure that traditional Christian values are restored and strengthened\\". Controversies Texas Southern University protest On October 10, 2017, protesters at Texas Southern University (TSU) prevented Cain from speaking at a Federalist Society event on campus. Cain was invited by the president of TSU's Federalist Society student chapter to speak to students at the traditionally black university. He planned to talk about the Texas Legislature's most recent special session. During that session Cain proposed an amendment to a budget bill which would prevent the state of Texas from paying for sex reassignment surgery and hormone therapy for inmates in prison, and he voted in favor of a proposed \\"bathroom bill\\". Protesters claimed that Cain \\"has ties to the Alt-Right and is anti-LGBT\\" and drowned out Cain's attempts to speak. They were removed; as Cain began to speak again the school's president ordered the protesters be brought back in and canceled the event, saying the Federalist Society chapter was an unregistered student group and the event was \\"unapproved\\". The Federalist Society chapter president said that while the Society is a law school organization under the Student Bar Association, it was not registered with the main campus's student government association, but that he would register it if asked to. Dallas Morning News Cain said in a statement that the talk had been scheduled for months, and that he was \\"brought into a room in which the administration had specifically requested the talk occur. Then Black Lives Matter came in and bullied the administration into ending the event.\\" James Douglas, the interim dean of TSU's Thurgood Marshall School of Law, said the event had been cleared with him and that he was investigating the incident. He said, \\"We have a process here in the law school, and they went through our process. The speaker had a First Amendment right to be heard by the students that invited him.\\" A student who had helped organize the protest said that \\"[w]ith his First Amendment right to espouse hate comes our First Amendment right\\" to protest. Cain, a partner at a law firm where he practices First Amendment law, said he intended to sue the school and its president for infringing upon his First Amendment rights. Stephen Hawking tweet On March 14, 2018, Cain tweeted about the death of prominent physicist Stephen Hawking. In his tweet, he stated \\"Stephen Hawking now knows the truth about how the universe was actually made. My condolences to his family.\\" The tweet was largely perceived to be insensitive and was criticized by legislators on both sides of the aisle. Texas Democratic Convention prank On June 22, 2018, Cain and three other men snuck into the Texas Democratic Party's state convention being held at the Fort Worth Convention Center in Forth Worth, Texas where Cain and three other men handed out 100 yard signs which read, \\"This home is a gun-free safe space\\" to convention attendees. Eventually, convention goers recognized who Cain was, and he and the other pranksters were forced to leave. When asked about the stunt, Cain said he distributed the signs as \\"irony\\" and stated, \\"It's amazing how many people took one and thanked us. They said they would put it in front of their house. I think it's funny. Nobody should put this in front of their house.\\" Beto O'Rourke Twitter Feud Beto O'Rourke, former United States House of Representatives member and 2020 presidential candidate On September 5, 2019, Cain tweeted \\"Dear @BetoORourke, I‚Äôll give you my gun when you pry it from my cold, dead hands. Sincerely, A Real Texan\\" to former U.S. House of Representatives member and then presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke. Seven days later, on September 12, 2019, Beto O'Rourke said \\"Hell yes we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47\\" during a Democratic presidential primary debate. In response, Cain tweeted \\"My AR is ready for you Robert Francis [O'Rourke's first and middle name].\\" O‚ÄôRourke labeled the tweet a \\"death threat\\", and replied to Cain with a tweet reading, \\"Clearly, you shouldn‚Äôt own an AR-15 ‚Äî and neither should anyone else\\". Cain responded with a tweet, \\"You‚Äôre a child Robert Francis.\\" Twitter gave Cain 12 hours to remove the post. After did not, the company removed Cain's \\"My AR is ready for you\\" tweet, saying it was against the site's policy against violent threats. Cain was suspended from Twitter for 141 days. On January 31, 2020, the day the social media company lifted its suspension of Cain's Twitter account, Cain tweeted a screenshot of the interaction between him and O'Rourke writing, \\"But seriously @twitter, y‚Äôall banned me for this.\\" When asked if he regretted the tweet, Cain was unapologetic stating, \\"I don't regret it.\\" Personal life Cain is married with 4 children. On April 25, 2019, during a Texas House session to recognize Autism Awareness Month, he stated that he has been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, and struggles maintaining eye contact as a result. He serves with the rank of captain in the Texas State Guard.

It was the first company to supply baseball bats manufactured from maple wood to professional baseball players. As of 2013, it is one of 32 licensed baseball bat suppliers for Major League Baseball (MLB) and Minor League Baseball (MiLB) players. It is also a bat supplier for baseball leagues throughout the world, including Germany, Japan, Korea, Italy, Mexico, and the Netherlands. It is the official bat manufacturer for the Australian Baseball League. The company was founded in 1997 by Sam Holman, who manufactured bats in his garage at the company's inception. Its president is Arlene Anderson, who with her husband Jim and investor Paul Balharrie acquired shares in the company in 2008. The company sponsors the Ottawa Champions official radio network, the SamBat Champions Radio Network. Background Holman was raised in Kansas City and rural South Dakota. After serving in the United States Army, he married a Canadian woman and moved to Ottawa. They later divorced, after which he became a stagehand carpenter at the National Arts Centre. He quit in 1994 after sustaining a knee injury. After spring training in 1996, Holman's friend Bill Mackenzie, who was working as an MLB baseball scout for the Colorado Rockies, told him that baseball bats were breaking too frequently, asking Holman if he could \\"do something about it\\". Holman read about the physics of baseball and researched baseball bat patents. After some trials with ironwood, he eventually settled on using maple wood, which has greater density than the traditional ash wood, to manufacture bats. He manufactured his first bat in his garage from a stairway bannister, and tested the 33-ounce bat with local children before Mackenzie suggested a test trial with the Ottawa Lynx, a nearby Triple-A minor league team in the International League. Among the players to test the bat was Fernando Seguignol, who became the first professional player to hit a home run with a maple bat. In April 1997, Holman went to Toronto, where he met with Joe Carter, Carlos Delgado, and Ed Sprague, convincing them to test his bats during batting practice. Holman established the company with financing from his sister in 1997 following the successful trial of his bats by the Toronto Blue Jays. Carter used a Sam Bat, which was not officially licensed by MLB at the time, by sneaking it into a game during the 1997 season, hitting a home run in one of his at-bats. He became the company's first MLB client. In 1998, MLB approved the maple bat for use in games, and Sam Bat became an authorized licensee of MLB. Holman continued to manufacture baseball bats in a workshop at his home until opening a factory on a site in Gatineau in late 2001. In November 2011, the company moved to North Industrial Park in Carleton Place. Holman's brother Nathan designed the bat logo. Production The company does not disclose the source of wood for its bats, neither supplier nor region. In the past, it has sourced its wood from a supplier in the Catskill Mountains. The bats it manufactures are made from Acer saccharum, also known as rock maple or sugar maple. The company purchases veneer-grade cylindrical billets having 8% moisture weighing between . The billets are sorted by weight after being weighed \\"to the thousandth ounce\\", and the slope of the grain is visually graded; billets with the straightest grain are reserved for MLB players. Each bat model can be manufactured using billets in a small range of weights (for example, the bat manufactured for Miguel Cabrera is made from billets between , usually ). After a final visual inspection, it is mounted into a wood tracer lathe, which in up to four minutes shapes the billet to match a template, leaving sufficient material for sanding. The bat's handle and barrel are then measured with a caliper to ensure it meets the template's specifications, and for models that require it, the end of the barrel is cupped (a small indentation is carved into the head of the barrel to shift the bat's centre of gravity toward the handle). The superfluous ends are cut off, and it is then mounted into a sanding lathe, which smooths the bat to its desired weight. A drop of ink is placed about from the base of the handle, and follows the wood's grain. The path it follows is measured with a protractor using a magnifying glass, and those diverging by more than 3¬∞ are rejected. This \\"ink- dot test\\" is required by Major League Baseball to ensure bats used in MLB games are less prone to break. Microscopic scratches are smoothed, the bat is painted to the specifications defined by the player for whom it was produced, and the player's name and bat model are laser engraved on the barrel. Each bat is labelled with the logo of a bat and the term \\"Rideau Crusher\\", a reference to the nearby Rideau Canal. It is finished with a coat of varnish and dried overnight before being shipped with silica gel, a desiccant that controls humidity to ensure the moisture in the bat does not change. Clients After the 1997 Major League Baseball season, Carter became a free agent, playing for the Baltimore Orioles and later the San Francisco Giants. While with the Giants, he told slugger Barry Bonds about the maple bats. Holman brought a set of bats to spring training in the 1999 season, where he met Bonds, who tested them during batting practice. In the 2001 season, Bonds hit 73 home runs using the Sam Bat, setting a single-season home run record. Bonds became Sam Bat's best client, citing the personal contact with \\"the man who's bent over making the bats\\", and the popularity of maple-based bats increased significantly after he began using them. By 2015, the company had 185 MLB players as clients, among them Ryan Braun, Miguel Cabrera, Yoenis C√©spedes, Dustin Pedroia, Troy Tulowitzki, and Chase Utley. Finances In 2006, Holman listed the company for sale on eBay for $3.5 million, citing his age and that the company was underfunded. In addition to the factory, machinery, and kilns, he advertised the company's patents and a \\"client list of the world's top hitters in baseball\\". At the time, the company had nine employees, produced about 17,000 bats a year generating sales of US$1.3 million ($ million in ), with about 150 Major League Baseball hitters as clients. Holman did not expect any bids from the listing, which he used partly as a means to advertise the sale of his business. This also provided Holman some time to find investors. Three of five parties that eventually contacted him about purchasing the business learned of it as a result of the eBay listing. In 2007, Paul Balharrie, and husband and wife Arlene and Jim Anderson bought shares in the company. The Andersons own 50% of the company, and Arlene Anderson became the company's president. Bonds worried that his bat supply may no longer be guaranteed, wrote a cheque for $40,000 to assure delivery of 80 bats during the season. This stabilised the company's finances, enabling it to buy wood it needed to manufacture the bats. Legacy Initially, Sam Bat was the only company producing maple baseball bats for use in professional and amateur games. With its success, by 2006 there were 30 companies that had developed maple baseball bats to compete with Sam Bat. The company now earns 85% of its revenue from international markets, including France, Germany, Japan, Korea, Italy, Mexico, and the Netherlands. It is the official bat manufacturer for the Australian Baseball League. In 2004, Holman received an invitation to meet George W. Bush (President of the United States) and Condoleezza Rice (United States Secretary of State nominee) during a state visit to Ottawa. On 26 November 2004, a member of the Office of the Prime Minister asked Holman to prepare a bat as an official state gift for the president, an avid baseball fan who had previously owned the Texas Rangers. During a reception at the Canadian Museum of History on 30 November, he presented two bats, one inscribed with \\"Prez 43\\" and \\"to the future commissioner of baseball\\", the other for his father George H. W. Bush inscribed with \\"Prez 41\\" and \\"to the father of the future commissioner of baseball\\". Later at the reception, Holman arranged a telephone conversation between Bonds and his fan Rice.

He was returned unopposed at the 1715 general election and sat until his death in 1720. He made little impression in Parliament. Trenchard died without issue on 18 March 1720.

She is best known for her 1898 painting, Vision de Saint Jean √† Patmos.  Biography  Brown was born in Boston in 1872, one of three children of Edward P. Brown, a lawyer, and Emma Isadore (Clapp) Brown. Her older sister, Edith Blake Brown, was also an artist who taught at the Cleveland School of Art. Ethel studied at the Cowles Art School in Boston and with Luc-Olivier Merson in Paris. She painted religious scenes, travel scenes, and portraits. In the late 1890s she exhibited at the National Academy of Design, the Society of American Artists, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and at the Salon du Champs de Mars in Paris. From 1902 to 1906 she taught drawing, painting, and art history at the Saint Agnes School for Girls in Albany, New York. After her sister died suddenly in 1907, Brown moved in with her brother-in-law and his two small children and remained there until he died in 1936. She died at her home in New Windsor, New York, in 1944. Brown, her sister, and Elisabeth Parsons designed a stained glass window that was displayed in the Woman's Building at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The feminist-themed piece, titled Massachusetts Mothering the Coming Woman of Liberty, Progress and Light, was sponsored by the Women's Educational and Industrial Union. As of 2012 it was housed in the Smith Museum of Stained Glass Windows in Chicago. The older woman on the right represents Massachusetts, nurturing and encouraging the liberated young woman of the future. Her best known painting is Vision de Saint Jean √† Patmos (1898), which depicts the Revelation of St. John the Divine on the Isle of Patmos. It is remarkable for its inventive use of light and shadow. The painting is included in the collection of the Smithsonian American Art Museum and is an example of American Symbolist painting. Brown was also an accomplished illustrator; her drawings appeared in The Quarterly Illustrator, and she illustrated an 1893 edition of William Black's A Princess of Thule.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. At the time of its nomination it consisted of 33 resources, which included 30 contributing buildings and three non-contributing buildings. with In 2015 the boundaries were increased to include five more buildings. Four of the buildings are contributing properties that were excluded from the original district because they were slated to be torn down as a part of the expansion of U.S. Route 61. While the highway was built the buildings were spared. The fifth building is non-contributing as are three structures. This is primarily a commercial area located immediately south of the central business district. Originally, this is where the city's commercial district was located because of its proximity to the ferry and riverboat landings. After 1860 most of the larger retail businesses, banks, and professional offices moved further north on Main Street, and new wholesale businesses moved here and built new structures. The buildings are all constructed in brick and are between three and four stories tall. It is considered to be the \\"largest concentration of significant nineteenth-century commercial architecture\\" in Dubuque.

The Pulpit Commentary suggests that the application of the text by Saint Paul (Romans 10:20) to the calling of the Gentiles will be felt by all believers in inspiration to preclude the interpretation which supposes Israel to be the subject of verse 1 no less than of verses 2-7. * \\"I am found of them\\": Paul has rendered this Romans 10:20, ·ºòŒºœÜŒ±ŒΩ·Ω¥œÇ ·ºêŒ≥ŒµŒΩœåŒºŒ∑ŒΩ Emphanƒìs egenomƒìn - 'I was made manifest.'

He is best known as the father of Ulysses S. Grant and the one who introduced Ulysses to military life at West Point. Jesse was born in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, and was one of seven children. He was a self-made man who rose from poverty to become a somewhat wealthy merchant. At age five, Jesse's family moved to Ohio and settled in the Ohio River Valley. Unable to support all his children Jesse's father arranged for his apprenticeship at farms and tanneries during his youth. Jesse married Hannah Simpson Grant and they became the parents of three boys and three girls, with Ulysses being their oldest. Raised in a poor family that was forced to split up and having to work at an early age, Jesse persistently encouraged his sons in the ways of education, industry and hard work, his methods sometimes testing his father-son relationship with Ulysses. As a young man he worked for and came to know Owen Brown and soon acquired strong abolitionist sympathies. Jesse was known to be outspoken, had strong opinions about politics and often boasted about his son, often referring to him as \\"my Ulysses\\". Originally a Jacksonian, Jesse eventually broke with the Democrats as he developed anti-slavery leanings, and for a time wrote a number of controversial editorials in support of abolition and other issues, including Ulysses at Shiloh. He became involved in local politics and was elected mayor in Georgetown and later, Bethel, both in Ohio. During the American Civil War Jesse and his two partners became involved in cotton speculation and personally prevailed upon his son Ulysses, now a Commanding General, requesting permits to deal in cotton in Grant's district, causing serious complications. Soon after the war Jesse stood next to his son Ulysses while he was sworn in as President, thereafter becoming a frequent visitor to the White House, while living out his final years in Covington, Kentucky. Much has been learned about the earlier years of his son Ulysses from letters between the two and other material relating to Jesse's background and business. Grant family Jesse's paternal Scottish ancestor, Matthew Grant, and wife Priscilla and their infant daughter, embarked from Plymouth, England, aboard the Mary and John with a party of 140 emigrants who had been gathered chiefly from South West England. This Pilgrim party was one of many of the Puritan movement that fled England to escape religious persecution. After a 70-day journey the party arrived at Massachusetts Bay colony in Nantasket, on May 30, 1630, and soon moved to and settled in Windsor, Connecticut. Matthew, referred to by the town folk as Honest Matthew Grant, was a highly trusted member of the community and became a surveyor and the town clerk.White, 2016, p. 4 McFeely, 1981, p. 3 Marshall, 1869, pp. 6-7 Thayer, 1885, p. 35 Later generations of the extended Grant family migrated westward into Pennsylvania, Ohio and Kentucky.Headley, 1872, p. 20 Jesse's grandfather Noah Grant, and his brother Solomon, fought and died in the French and Indian War, and his son, (Jesse's father) also named Noah, served in the American Revolution, including the Battle of Bunker Hill, soon advancing to the rank of Captain.Marshall, 1869, p. 52 Smith, 2001, p. 23 Thayer, 1885, pp. 36-37 Early life Jesse's father, Noah Grant, was married to his first wife, Anna Richardson, who became the parents of two children, Solomon and Peter Grant. Upon Noah's return from service in 1787 Anna died. On March 4, 1792, at Greensburg, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, Noah married his second wife, Rachael Kelly, who became Jesse's mother with the birth of her first born child on January 23, 1794.Marshall, 1869, pp. 52-53, 170‚Äì171 Noah named Jesse after the Honorable Jesse Root, Chief Justice of the Superior Court of Connecticut.Marshall, 1869, p. 172; Richardson, 1868, p. 35 In 1799, when Jesse was age five, Noah moved his family to East Liverpool, and again in 1804, to Deerfield, both in Ohio. Noah worked in a shoe shop, earning a modest wage in Greensburg. In 1805, at age 9, Jesse's mother died, in Deerfield.Broadwater, 2012, p. 3; White, 2016, p. 6. With little income and unable to provide enough for all his children, Noah Grant had the eleven year old Jesse apprenticed out to various families. Beginning in 1805, from 11 to 14 years old, Jesse worked in Ohio at undesignated farms earning his keep and making little extra money. He didn't receive a formal education in his youth and later through years of apprenticeship became self-taught in the ways of general education and business. Placing great value on the merits of education he vowed that his sons would not have to endure the same disadvantage.Brands, 2012, p. 7; King, 1914. p. 25 With no public schools in most of Ohio in the early 1800s, Jesse would later send his son Ulysses to private schools. In 1808 Jesse's father arranged for his apprenticeship with a judge, George Tod, of Youngstown, Ohio.White, 2016, p. 7 Jesse, age 14, lived there with his oldest sibling, Susan, while he worked under an apprenticeship that lasted four years. At the Tod residence the young Grants were treated like one of the family, where they grew to love and respect George, his wife and family. Jesse was sent to school three months a year, for two years.Marshall, 1869, p. 42 Among Jesse's playmates was the young David Tod, who would later become Governor of Ohio during the Civil War. Later in life Jesse often spoke of them in terms of affection and admiration.King, 1914, p. 17 Working for the judge the uneducated Jesse soon learned to read and write and acquired an interest in politics, and later after he married, would even study grammar. A year after his commencement into apprenticeship Jesse's father Noah died, leaving him an orphan and the family very poor.Headley, 1872, p. 20; Brands, 1981, p. 6 At age 16 Jesse moved to Maysville, Kentucky in 1812 to work for his half brother Peter in a tannery. Under his guidance, Jesse learned the tanning and leather goods trade. After completion of his training and honoring his commitment to Peter, he moved back to his boyhood town of Deerfield, Ohio,McFeely, 1982, pp. 5‚Äì6.Broadwater, 2012, p. 3 in 1815 and established his own tannery with little money, frugality and constant effort.Richardson, 1868, p. 45 By 1814 Jesse found employment at a tannery 15 miles away in Ravenna, Ohio, owned by the wealthy Owen Brown (father of the famous John Brown who led the raid at Harpers Ferry). Owen was a cattle breeder and land speculator who operated a successful tannery in Hudson, Ohio. Owen was a stout and outspoken abolitionist and Jesse often listened to his public orations against slavery, where he became familiar with and supportive of the cause.White, 2016, pp. 7‚Äì8 During this time Jesse lived under the same roof as John Brown, became friends and came to know his abolitionist philosophy. Later in life Jesse would describe John Brown as \\"a man of great purity of character, of high moral and physical courage, but a fanatic and extremist in whatever he advocated.\\" In 1817 Jesse, and a John F. Wells, were offered work in a large tannery in Ravenna, now owned and managed by Mrs. Mary Mason, the widow of Jared Mason. She later married Wells and sold the tannery to Jesse who became the sole owner. Jesse sold and shipped much of his leather to a merchant in Point Pleasant, which would become his future home in 1820. During this time Jesse took up lodging at an inn across the street from the tannery. Within two years he managed to save some $1500. Jesse's father Noah Grant died in Maysville, Kentucky, on February 14, 1819.White, 2016, pp. 7‚Äì8.U.S.Grant.com, Essay & Timeline That year, at age 25, Jesse became ill and was sent to Kentucky to recover from malaria, while his affliction sickness lasted more than a year. Unable to work and with creditors pressing he lost most of his savings. In 1820, when he was partially recovered and able to travel short distances, he moved to Maysville and lived with relatives for several weeks.Richardson, 1868, p. 46 After recovering he returned to Ohio and the tannery business. Family and community life Jesse and Hannah Grant Jesse Grant's greater family was large, residing in both Ohio and in the slave state of Kentucky.Simpson, 2000, p. 7 In 1820, he found work for a brief period at a tannery in Bethel, Ohio. Later that year, as an experienced tanner, he moved to Point Pleasant on the Ohio River and gained the position of foreman in a new tannery owned by Thomas Page.White, 2016, p. 8; McFeely, 1982, p. 6. He soon met his future wife, Hannah Simpson, whose grandfather had arrived at Philadelphia in 1762.White, 2016, pp. 7‚Äì8, 21‚Äì22. On June 24, 1821, at age 27, Jesse Grant married Hannah Simpson and settled in Point Pleasant.Marshall, 1869, pp. 65‚Äì66. Their marriage brought six children. Their son Ulysses, Hiram Ulysses Grant, was the oldest, born April 27, 1822.Headley, 1872, pp. 20‚Äì21 Samuel Simpson, was born September 23, 1825, who became a successful merchant in Galena; Their first daughter, Clara B. was born December 11, 1828; Second daughter Virginia Paine was born February 20, 1832; Their third son, Orville Lynchomb, was born May 15, 1835; Their third daughter and youngest child was Mary Frances, born July 30, 1839.Marshall, 1869, p. 173 By October 1823, Jesse had managed to save about $1100 to start his own tannery in Georgetown and moved the family there to start his new business. Upon arrival to Georgetown Jesse contacted the county Justice of the Peace, Thomas L. Hamer, on August 12, 1823, paid $50 and secured the deed to a lot not far from Georgetown Square. Here he built a two-story brick house where Ulysses, still an only child, and future brothers and sisters would be raised for the next sixteen years. On the same street he set up his tannery, a half block south from his house.White, 2013, p. 18 Jesse also cultivated 30 acres of land while managing 50 acres of forest.White, 2016, p. 18 With a successful business Jesse was able to pay off the deed within one year. When his second son, Samuel Simpson, was born Jesse built one of several additions to the home, eventually doubling the size of the house.McFeely, p. 14 Father Historical depiction Grant's home, Point Pleasant, birthplace of Ulysses S. Grant Less than a year after Jesse and Hannah were married they became the parents of their first son, whose name would become Hiram Ulysses Grant. Jesse's first born son was met with much expectation and family fanfare. Family tradition as the Grant family observed it held that the naming of a first born son was a significant undertaking and something that was given much consideration. Members among the immediate Grant and Simpson families were all hoping for their own personal favorite names for the infant son. Subsequently, several weeks after the child's birth Jesse and Hannah still had not settled on a name. After mounting inquiries from friends and neighbors about the name for the boy, members of the Grant and Simpson family finally gathered at the Simpson family home to decide on a name. The prospective names were placed in a hat, a process which Hannah expressed reservation for, deeming it uncivilized. However, faced with the prospect of returning home without a name for the baby she finally consented. Jesse and Grandmother Simpson cast ballots for Ulysses, which was taken from a novel in Fran√ßois F√©nelon's novel, Telemachus, lent to her by Jesse, and poem. Grandfather Simpson, out of respect for an honored ancestor, also cast a ballot for Hiram. Six ballots in all were cast, where the name 'Ulysses', was drawn by Hannah's youngest sister, Anne. Wanting also to honor the Simpson family, Jesse at this time declared that his son's name would be Hiram Ulysses Grant, which the infant was Christened with and became his formal and legal name.White, 2016, pp. 9-10; Simpson, 2000, p. 2; Thayer, 1885, pp. 26‚Äì30; Richardson, 1868, p. 49 Jesse, however, would always refer to his son as Ulysses, often referring to him as \\"my Ulysses\\". It is generally accepted among historians that Hannah and Jesse loved and took much pride in their children and their accomplishments.White, 2016, pp. 9-10 Jesse placed his eldest son, 'Hiram Ulysses', in a local one room school house in Georgetown. Later he would send Ulysses to boarding school across the river in Maysville, Kentucky, and to another in Ripley, Ohio, but to Jesse's disappointment these prospects never materialized into anything that justified his investment.Smith, 2001, p. 22; White, 2016, pp. 9-10, 20; At an early age Jesse prevailed on his son to work at his tannery, but it wasn't long before Ulysses expressed a strong dislike for the practice. Not wanting to force his son into such labor Jesse instead gave the young Ulysses other responsibilities, driving and transporting wagon loads of bark, supplies and goods to and from the tannery.McFeely, 1981, pp. 9-10 As Ulysses showed a great ability to ride and manage horses, Jesse put this talent to use and one day offered Ulysses the job of driving a wagon and team of horses, 40 miles away to Cincinnati, picking up passengers and returning home. Before long he would often send his son on other business related journeys, transporting goods and people, on a regular basis.Brands, 2012, p. 8; Thayer, 1885, pp. 72‚Äì73. Grant household in Georgetown Jesse became very proud of his eldest son and his ability as he came of age, often telling stories about and referring to him as \\"my Ulysses\\". As the independent minded Ulysses became of age, however, their paternal relationship would be put through various trials.Simpson, 2000, pp. 8‚Äì9. In 1838 Jesse enrolled Ulysses in abolitionist John Rankin's academy during the winter period. Always striving to secure good education for his sons, Jesse made arrangements for Ulysses to be nominated and enrolled in the U.S. military academy at West Point without Ulysses' knowledge. Through his political associations Jesse was referred to a former friend, Thomas Hamer, who was also a prominent lawyer and was being considered by the Democrats as a possible candidate for the Presidency, asking him to nominate Ulysses. However, because of Jesse's past indifference with Hamer over Jacksonian politics,Chernow, 2017, p.17. he attempted to bypass him and instead wrote to Thomas Morris, senator from Ohio, asking that he nominate Ulysses. Morris wrote back on February 19, 1839, explaining that Hamer was the only one authorized to submit a nomination from Brown County Here Jesse found himself in an awkward position, as a few years earlier he had criticized Hamer in the Castigator over a disagreement involving Andrew Jackson, use of public funds and a U.S. bank. To Jesse's surprise, Hamer honored his request and gave the nomination to Ulysses, asking \\"why didn't you apply to me sooner?\\",Smith, 2001, p. 24. and in so doing, restored their friendship.White, 2016, pp. 23-24. When Hamer submitted the nomination he incorrectly entered the name \\"Ulysses S. Grant\\", which became the formal name and would stay with Ulysses throughout his adult life.Smith, 2001, p. 24; Brands, 2012, p. 9; Chernow, 2017, p. 18 Ulysses had no particular inclination to military life at that time and at first declined to go, expressing little appreciation for the efforts of his father and friends. After a brief discussion, however, Jesse was able to convince Ulysses to enroll in the academy. As Ulysses was eager to set out into a world he had seen little of, he now saw the prospect as an opportunity to do so with the hopes of becoming successful on his own. Upon word of his acceptance to West Point, Ulysses departed for New York on May 15, 1839.Brands, 2012, pp. 9, 220 White, 2016, pp. 22‚Äì23 In 1847 Jesse sold his Georgetown home to Marshall Jenning for $2600. When Ulysses was stationed on the West coast of California at Fort Humboldt in 1854 he had at that point been away from his wife and family two years. Longing to return home, and also prompted by rumors of excessive drinking, Ulysses tendered his resignation. Shocked by the news, Jesse intervened, feeling Ulysses was making a terrible mistake, and urged Congressmen Andrew Ellison, and old friend of Jesse's, to get the War Department to order Grant home on recruitment duty instead, or otherwise grant him a six-month leave. Ellison presented the request to Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, but the request was denied. This would prove to be one more example of Jesse's involvement with his son's affairs.Smith, 2001, pp. 88-89 Church Jesse regarded education and church as of equal importance.Simpson, 2000, p. 2 Along with his wife Hannah, they embraced the Methodist doctrine of sanctification, and living a holy and upright life and taught their children to observe the Sabbath day. They refrained from playing cards, or dancing, and would not permit their children to dance, or swear. With no Methodist church on the Ohio frontier, they had both helped to found a Methodist church in Georgetown which began holding services in 1827.White, pp. 19-20. Jesse became a \\"ruling spirit in church affairs\\", a leading member of the congregation and served the church as a trustee and steward.McFeely, 1981, p. 20 Methodism in America was growing rapidly as various Methodist clergymen traveled about in a \\"circuit\\", establishing churches along the way. Jesse would make his home available to any such minister that came to town.White, 2016, p. 19Thayer, 1885, p. 58 Politics When Grant wasn't working at the tannery he spent time writing, was sometimes known to be unreserved and outspoken with his opinions on slavery and abolition and became politically active in Georgetown.Simpson, 2000, pp. 6‚Äì7. In 1830 Jesse became a Master in the Masonic Lodge and lent much of his time to writing about politics and social issues for an abolitionist newspaper called The Castigator, a weekly newspaper in Ripley. Its editor was David Ammen, a close associate of abolitionist John Rankin who also resided in Ripley. Through their associations Ammen's son became a playmate of Grant's son Ulysses.White, 2016, p. 12 In 1837 he wrote a number of controversial editorials in The Castigator.Simpson, 2000, p. 6.Library of Congress Archives, 2017 Originally he was a Democrat politically, and he considered himself a Jacksonian Democrat.McFeely, 1981, p. 8 Grant ran unsuccessfully for Georgetown mayer in 1830 and for the state legislature in 1832. He wrote in The Castigator defending Jackson's veto of a recharter bill for the Second Bank of the United States, declaring that \\"only those with the haintful taint of aristocracy\\" opposed the veto. However, in the 1832 elections later that year, Grant switched his position on the Bank to supporting recharter. The change in his political views ruined his friendship with powerful Jacksonian Thomas L. Hamer, who said that Grant cared \\"not who sinks so long as he swims...He is alike faithfless in his political principles, and his personal attachments.\\" Grant abandoned the Democrats and became a Whig. He supported the American System of Henry Clay, which called for a central bank, protective tariff, and internal improvements.Chernow, 2017, pp. 8-9 Grant was elected as the Whig mayor of Georgetown, Ohio, serving from 1837 to 1839. Just before and during the Civil War he was a Lincoln supporter, politically active and outspoken against slavery and secession, and wrote a series of controversial editorials on these issues in prominent Northern newspapers. Bethel In 1841 Jesse returned to Bethel and purchased a house owned by former Ohio Senator Thomas Morris and soon opened his own tannery nearby on the same street.McFeely, 1982, p. 66 That same year Ulysses came to visit on a summer furlough from West Point after being there two years. Knowing Ulysses' great love of horses, Jesse gave him an unbroken horse to train and ride during his stay.McFeely, 1981, p. 18 After a ten-year residency in Bethel, Jesse was elected that town's first mayor, in 1851. After serving a four-year term Jesse moved to Covington, Kentucky, and opened another leather store on Madison Avenue. On August 22, 1848, Jesse's son Ulysses married Julia Dent at her parents townhouse in St. Louis, but Jesse, an ardent and outspoken abolitionist, didn't attend their wedding, not because he wasn't fond of Julia, but because Julia's father Fredrick Dent, owned slaves.McFeely, 1982, p. 6 King, Gilbert, 2012 Present at the wedding was Fredrick's friend and future Confederate General, James Longstreet, who was a cousin to the bride, Julia, and best man at the wedding.Smith, 2001, p. 7 At the end of the month Ulysses and Julia traveled to Bethel where Julia met the greater Grant and Simpson families, who along with Jesse and Hannah, welcomed Julia into the family.Simpson, 2014, p. 49 In August 1853 Jesse's son Ulysses was assigned to duty on the west coast at Fort Humboldt, but ran into difficulty with his commanding officer at the remote fort when rumors began to circulate about Ulysses' alleged excessive drinking. After being given the choice to resign or face court-marshal Ulysses resigned and returned home to his wife and children much to the disappointed of his father, who upon his arrival expressed his feelings with the comment, \\"West Point spoiled one of my boys for business\\", where Ulysses replied \\"I guess that's about so\\". Jesse made attempts to avert his son's resignation and wrote to Jefferson Davis of the War Department, but his appeal for his son's reinstatement was turned down.Simpson, 2000, pp. 61-64 Galena Grant & Perkins, leather store, Galena, Illinois, 1862 Later Jesse formed a partnership with E. A. Collins and opened another leather goods store, on Main Street, in Galena, Illinois, with the hope of establishing his three sons in the business so he could retire. The store was housed in a handsome four story brick building on the curving Main Street, whose store front was garnished with displays of fancy saddles and boots.Chernow, 2017, p.114 The store sold harnesses, saddles and other leather goods, while it bought hides from the local farmers. Jesse withdrew from the business almost entirely while the store was operated by his sons Simpson (Samuel) and Orville. By 1860 he had bought out his partner and assumed full ownership of the entire operation. Jesse, now sixty, withdrew from the business and passed control of the enterprise over to his three sons, Simpson, Orville, and soon, Ulysses.Chernow, 2017, pp.92, 113 After resigning from the Army and failing at farming and several business ventures, Ulysses Grant turned to his father for help and accepted a job clerking at the Galena store, arriving there in April. He functioned doing routine work and tended the companies books. During the winter months he would travel to neighboring states to purchase green hides from local farmers. In the days preceding the war and after the attack on Fort Sumter, Jesse's leather store became a hotbed of Republican discussion and agitation. Jesse and his sons Simpson and Orvil, were all staunch Republicans, while Ulysses had Democrat leanings and originally favored Douglas over Lincoln. The looming war would soon diminish such differences for all. Various speakers, including Jesse's lawyer, John Rawlins, engaged in a number of passionate public discussions over secession and other politics.White, 2016, pp. 142-143 Ulysses Grant was still working at the store when on April 15, the day after the battle, news of the attack on Fort Sumter reached Galena, where he promptly re-enlisted into the Army, answering President Lincoln's call for seventy five thousand volunteers.Cramer, 1912, p. 11Thayer, 1885, p. 147 Among the things being discussed at the meetings was the pressing issue of recruitment. A West Point graduate, Ulysses was the only man in town with professional military training, and was elected to preside over the meeting.McFeely, 1981, p. 73 When Ulysses was given command of the 21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment, a regiment composed of unruly volunteers, Jesse expressed disappointment in a letter to him, feeling that Ulysses' talent and efforts would have been better used commanding regular army troops. In a reply letter to his father Ulysses attempted to abate Jesse's criticism maintaining, \\"You ask if I should not like to go in the regular army. I should not. I want to bring my children (recruits) up to useful employment, and in the army the chance is poor\\", stressing the point that he was more concerned about the war than he was a career.McFeely, 1981, p. 80 Civil War era Jesse Grant in 1863, age 69 During the American Civil War Jesse resided in Covington, Kentucky, which remained neutral during that war. Jesse's son Simpson died of tuberculosis in September, 1861.Stoddard, 1886, p. 84 Thayer, 1885, p. 146 His son Ulysses brought his children to stay with him believing they would be safer there. Jesse followed the continuing successes of Ulysses as he advanced in rank and assumed command of major campaigns. When controversial stories appeared in newspapers about the heavy casualties suffered under Generals Prentiss and McClernand at the Battle of Shiloh under the command of Ulysses S. Grant, Jesse defended his son and responded with numerous editorials in rebuttal in various Cincinnati newspapers in such a manner as to suggest he was speaking for his son the General. Jesse also wrote a heated letter to Governor Tod of Ohio, blaming \\"five thousand cowards\\" who threw down their arms and fled, for the high casualties that occurred at the battle.Chernow, 2017, p. 212 Jesse's letters became so frequent that General Grant, who had much distrust for newspapers and their coverage of the war, had to step in and forbid him from writing to the newspapers. In a letter to his father, Ulysses wrote, \\"my worst enemy could do me no more injury than you are doing\\".King, 1914 pp. 167‚Äì168 White, 2016, p. 225. As the war caused the price of cotton to escalate it invited many speculators, moving about in the midst of a major and prolonged military campaign against Vicksburg, causing many problems for the Union Army.Mcpherson, 1988, pp. 620‚Äì622 McFeely, 1981, p.124 At this time Jesse became involved in cotton speculation and arrived with his two partners, the Mack Brothers from Cincinnati, who had encouraged him to use his son's (General Grant) influence to obtain permits to purchase cotton in a war district. Traveling from Ohio they arrived unexpectedly at General Grant's headquarters in northern Mississippi while he was busy with commanding a major campaign. Grant had already received reports from Sherman and others of Jewish merchants who were \\"highly visible\\" among the trading which was occurring by both northern and southern interests, often without permits. General Ulysses S. Grant By the time Jesse and his two Jewish partners arrived with a request for permits to operate, they were immediately rebuffed by an angered General Grant for presuming on the Army and his patience. The incident had been indicative of the problem with cotton speculators in general who often collaborated with Union Officers, much to the frustration of General Grant. Various modern historians believe that Jesse's arrival with two prominent Jewish cotton speculators from Cincinnati is largely what led Grant in 1862 to issue General Order 11 expelling all Jews from his district.Sarna, 2010, pp. 358‚Äì359; McFeely, 1981, p.124; Mcpherson, 1988, p. 622. Jesse and his partners were instructed to leave the district on the next train going north. The incident proved to be an embarrassment for Grant which once again placed his father and himself on opposing sides of a serious issue.White, 2016, p. 252 Later, in a letter to Congressman Washburne, Jesse defended his son's action, claiming the Order was \\"issued by express instructions from Washington\\".Miers, 1984, pp. 55-56 After the war, on February 6, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Jesse for Postmaster in Covington, Kentucky, having the charge of a first class post office in a city numbering approximately thirty thousand residents. As President Ulysses Grant nominated him for another term on February 9, 1870 to continue after his first term had expired. The nomination was confirmed on March 2.Cross, 1874, p. 75Simon, 1998, p. 89 Jesse's business ventures proved to be very successful and he was now worth more than $100,000. He intended to give his children the greater part of his estate, however Ulysses didn't want any of it, feeling he had done nothing to deserve it. Instead Jesse gave $1000 to each of Ulysses' children for their education, with the remainder of his estate going to his other sons and daughters.Richardson, 1868, p. 170 Father of a president When Ulysses S. Grant was sworn in as President, Jesse was standing nearby, as Chief Justice Salmon Chase administered the Oath of Office, March 4, 1869. Jesse had arrived without his wife Hannah, who hated publicity and never came to the White House. Asked by reporters where his wife was, Jesse spoke briefly, informing all that she had been invited but declined. Before the inauguration Jesse had inquired about lodging for himself and family, where Ulysses informed him that his extra rooms had been promised to friends. Some historians suggest that Ulysses at this time was on uneasy terms with his father and made no further effort to secure lodging for Jesse and family.McFeely, 1981, p. 287 In the few remaining years of Jesse's life he was a frequent visitor to his son the president at the White House. He was always eager to comment to reporters about his son's activities and the business of the day. Jesse died June 29, 1873, in Covington, Kentucky, shortly after President Grant began his second term.White, 2016, p. 545. His funeral was held at the Union Methodist Episcopal Church in Covington. Jesse was buried at Spring Grove Cemetery, in Cincinnati, Ohio.Spencer, 1998, p. 45 His wife, Hannah, died ten years later in 1883, in Jersey City, New Jersey, just two years before their son Ulysses died.Geni.com, 2017 See also * Bibliography of Ulysses S.

KJV The Jerusalem Bible describes this verse as \\"a fragment condemning pagan mysteries\\" linked with verses 3 and 4.Jerusalem Bible (1966), sub-heading at verse 17 The nations gathered in (66:18‚Äì24) God states his purpose for the world to gather them (verse 18) with his means to carry it out into Jerusalem (verses 19‚Äì21), to witness the final glory and perdition. In Christian apocalyptic view, this can be connected to the first and second comings (or only the second coming) of Jesus Christ. Verse 19 :And I will set a sign among them, ::and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations, :to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, ::to Tubal, and Javan, to the isles afar off, :that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; ::and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.

Moreover, it is also used in three other places: (1) of the servant in Isaiah 42:3, that \\"a dimly burning wick ('smoking flax') he will not quench\\"; (2) that 'the fire devouring Edom \\"will not be quenched\\"' (34:10), and (3) 'those who oppose the LORD'S path are \\"quenched like a wick\\"' (43:17).

The railway's prime purpose was to carry iron ore from mines to Watchet harbour in Somerset, England. It was \\"general practice to pick up or set down passengers .. at Clitsome.\\" The line was unconnected to any other, though it passed under what is now the West Somerset Railway south of the village of Watchet. The stopping place was next to a level crossing. Services The line opened for goods traffic in 1857. A passenger service began in September 1865, connecting Watchet with the village of Washford and the hamlets of Roadwater and Comberow. Passengers were carried from Comberow up a rope-hauled incline to and on to on a wagon, free of charge, but at their own risk. The initial passenger service consisted of four trains a day out and back. Like other railways built to serve one industry, such as iron ore carrying lines in Cumbria, the WSMR's fortunes were at the mercy of that industry. Iron and steel making was given to boom and bust and suffered a significant downturn in the 1870s, exacerbated by imports of cheaper and better ore from abroad. The iron mines which provided the WSMR's staple traffic stuttered to complete closure between 1879 and 1883. The line did not close immediately, two mixed trains a day continued to run until 1898, when all traffic ceased. In 1907 the Somerset Mineral Syndicate made an attempt to revive the line, reopening Colton mine and starting a new bore at Timwood. Apart from a reopening day special on 4 July 1907 no passenger service was provided. The venture collapsed in March 1910. After closure in 1910 the line through Clitsome was subject to minimal maintenance. The line's tracks were lifted in 1917 as a contribution to the war effort. Abandonment With neither track, rolling stock nor prospects an Act of Parliament was sought and passed to abandon the railway. Its assets were auctioned on 8 August 1924 and the company was wound up in 1925. Evocative contemporary descriptions of the line in its later years have been preserved. Afterlife By 2016 much of the route could still be traced on the ground, on maps and on satellite images. The incline from Comberow to Brendon Hill is a Listed structure.

She co-founded College Hall, London, and funded and worked to get women elected to local government. Life Browne was born in Bridgwater in 1851. Both of her grandfathers fought at the Battle of Trafalgar.Sidmouth Philanthropist, 28 February 2012, Diana Bowerman, Sidmouth Herald, Retrieved 12 January 2017 She, her parents and her sister Mary moved to Clifton near Bristol. There she was educated by tutors and governesses before her family moved to London where she attended Queens College on Harley Street for a year in 1868. That same year John Beddoe and his wife. who were both friends with Mary Carpenter. hosted what was said to be the first women's suffrage meeting at their house in 1868. Browne attended and this was the start of long commitment to the suffrage cause.Jane Martin, ‚ÄòBrowne, Annie Leigh (1851‚Äì1936)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 12 Jan 2017 The two Browne sisters also worked with Octavia Hill, and with Samuel and Henrietta Barnett at Toynbee Hall. In 1880 she and Mary Stewart Kilgour campaigned for women's education; their work (with inputs from Mary Thomasina Browne - later Lady Lockyer - and Henrietta M√ºller) and Browne's money led to the opening of College Hall in Byng Place in 1882. It later (1932) moved to nearby Malet Street. In November 1888 the \\"Society for Promoting the Return of Women as County Councillors\\" was formed by twelve women. Browne provided early funding and she, Eva McLaren, the Marchioness of Aberdeen, Louisa Temple Mallett and Newnham College founder Millicent Garret Fawcett were key members. It later (1893) became the \\"Women's Local Government Society,\\" and its aim was to get women elected to local government. An early victory was the election of two women, Jane Cobden and Lady Margaret Sandhurst, to the London County Council. This was possible because of the wording of the Local Government Act 1888 which did not disqualify women candidates. A later court case determined that this was a mistake. Campaigns were unsuccessfully started to reverse the court's interpretation. However, in 1894 new legislation did allow married women to stand for school boards. Browne was a member of the Union of Practical Suffragists' executive committee in 1898, a member of the Central Society for Women's Suffrage (and its successor, the London Society for Women's Suffrage), and in February 1907 took part in the 'Mud March' organised by the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies.

In 1907 the Somerset Mineral Syndicate made an attempt to revive the line, reopening Colton mine and starting a new bore at Timwood. Apart from a reopening day special on 4 July 1907 no passenger service was provided. The venture collapsed in March 1910. After closure in 1910 the line through Torre was subject to minimal maintenance. The line's tracks were lifted in 1917 as a contribution to the war effort. Abandonment With neither track, rolling stock nor prospects an Act of Parliament was sought and passed to abandon the railway. Its assets were auctioned on 8 August 1924 and the company was wound up in 1925. Evocative contemporary descriptions of the line in its later years have been preserved. Afterlife By 2016 much of the route could still be traced on the ground, on maps and on satellite images. The incline from Comberow to Brendon Hill is a Listed structure.

Golb is an extensively litigated New York case in which Raphael Golb was convicted for sock puppetry (specifically identity theft, impersonation, harassment, and unauthorized use of a computer) relating to the Dead Sea Scrolls. His conviction was partially reversed on constitutional grounds, but was substantially affirmed.See People v. Golb, 23 N.Y.3d 455 (2014). Background A portion of a Dead Sea Scroll ‚Äì a copy of the Isaiah scroll, 1QIsab. Raphael Golb (Golb) is the son of Norman Golb, a professor of Jewish history and civilization at the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago. Professor Golb is a key proponent of the viewpoint that the Dead Sea Scrolls found at Qumran were not the product of the Essenes, as many authorities argue, but rather were written elsewhere and moved to Qumran in anticipation of the Roman siege and destruction of Jerusalem.See , (1996). \\"There is disagreement among scholars and experts about who wrote the Scrolls. One view, known as the Qumran-Sectarian theory, or Sectarian theory, is that the Scrolls were writings of a Jewish sect, living in or near Qumran. Norman Golb and others disagree with the Qumran-Sectarian theory. They believe that the Scrolls were writings of various groups and that the writings were rescued from libraries in Jerusalem and brought to the caves for safekeeping at the time of the siege and sacking of the city by Roman troops in 70 C.E. (the Jerusalem libraries theory). Professor Golb challenges the Qumran-Sectarian theory as unsupported by any actual evidence.\\" People v. Golb, 23 N.Y.3d 455, 460, 991 N.Y.S.2d 792, 795-96, 15 N.E.3d 805, 808-09 (2014). Among the scholars who disagreed with Professor Golb, and instead insisted that the scrolls are the work of Essenes of Qumran, are Frank Moore Cross of Harvard University and Lawrence Schiffman of New York University. In 2008, the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences opened a Dead Sea Scrolls exhibit, and invited to lecture at the exhibit University of North Carolina professor Bart D. Ehrman, who had suggested that the Essenes were the likely authors of the Scrolls. Raphael Golb then sent an email from frank.cross2@gmail.com, and signed Frank Cross, to four scholars at the University of North Carolina, linking to an anonymous blog post by Golb in which he had said that the museum should not have invited Ehrman to speak because he was not a Scrolls expert. The Frank Cross email commented, \\"It looks like Bart has gone and put his foot in his mouth again,\\"23 N.Y.3d at 461-62. Later in 2008, the Jewish Museum in New York City held a scrolls exhibition and invited Lawrence Schiffman. Golb wrote an article, using the pseudonym Peter Kaufman, which accused Schiffman of plagiarizing (a \\"little-known case of apparent academic quackery\\") some of Professor Norman Golb's ideas. Golb then sent emails from his own larry.schiffman@gmail.com to four of Schiffman's students with this message and a citation to the \\"Kaufman\\" article: > Apparently, someone is intent on exposing a minor failing of mine that dates > back almost fifteen years ago. You are not to mention the name of the > scholar in question to any of our students, and every effort must be made to > prevent this article from coming to their attention. This is my career at > stake. I hope you will all understand. Golb then sent a similar email message to every member of Schiffman's department at NYU. Next Golb sent emails to the university's Provost and the Dean of Graduate Studies, posing as Schiffman and asking them what he could do to counter the charges of plagiarism that the Kaufman article had raised against him. Golb then sent an email signed Lawrence Schiffman to NYU's student newspaper, imploring its staff \\"not to publish a word\\" about any plagiarism accusations against him.23 N.Y.3d at 462-63. Schiffman later testified that he felt \\"very attacked\\" by Golb's false emails, \\"and basically for like a month I couldn't do [any]thing but respond to people's inquiries.\\" In the fall of 2008, the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto held a Scrolls exhibit. Golb sent an email from seidel.jonathan@gmail.com, and signed as Jonathan Seidel, to the museum's Board of Trustees, stating: > The public has the right to know whether the ROM exhibit will indeed present > the two basic theories [regarding the origin of the Dead Sea Scrolls] in a > scientifically neutral manner ... or if it will rather stick to a \\"low-keyed > assertion of the mainstream view.\\" Furthermore, the public has a right to > know if University of Chicago historian Norman Golb, who is widely > considered to have debunked the traditional theory of the Dead Sea Scrolls > in his book, will be excluded from participating in the museum's lecture > series. Golb later sent the Board of Trustees two follow-up emails (still posing as Jonathan Seidel), urging them to include Professor Golb's ideas in their lecture series. Golb then used his seidel.jonathan@gmail.com account to ask Risa Levitt Kohn, the curator for the Toronto exhibit, whether she was \\"planning to answer Golb's critique of [her] catalogue.\\" Finally, Golb sent emails from his seidel.jonathan@gmail.com account to dozens of Dead Sea Scroll scholars. These emails, however, disparaged his father's work. (SA 865‚Äì66, 884). Among other things, the emails announced that Norman Golb's \\"Chicago filth must be answered as quickly as possible, so please let me know if you're willing to help out.\\" Golb signed two of these emails \\"Jonathan S,\\" and a third as Jonathan Seidel.23 N.Y.3d at 463-64. Subsequently, New York prosecutors charged Golb with two counts of identity theft in the second degree, 15 counts of identity theft in the third degree, ten counts of forgery in the third degree, 20 counts of criminal impersonation in the second degree, three counts of aggravated harassment in the second degree, and one count of unauthorized use of a computer, In 2010, a jury of the Supreme Court, New York County, convicted Golb on 30 counts: two counts of identity theft in the second degree; 14 counts of criminal impersonation in the second degree; ten counts of forgery in the third degree; three counts of aggravated harassment in the second degree; and one count of unauthorized use of a computer, and he received a six-month sentence.People v. Golb, 102 A.D.3d 601, 960 N.Y.S.2d 66, 67 (1st Dep't 2013). 2013 ruling of Appellate Division Golb appealed to the New York intermediate appellate court (the Appellate Division, First Department) and it modified the judgment. Golb's principal defense on appeal was that the emails were intended only to be satiric hoaxes or pranks, and therefore should not be held culpable. The court rejected the argument, denying that Golb's intent could have been parodic, because \\"parody must convey two simultaneous‚Äîand contradictory‚Äîmessages: that it is the original, but also that it is not the original and is instead a parody.\\" But here Golb only \\"intended to convey the first message to the readers of the emails, that is, that the purported authors were the actual authors. It was equally clear that defendant intended that the recipients' reliance on this deception would cause harm to the purported authors and benefits to defendant or his father.\\" The court also held, \\"Nothing in this prosecution, or in the court's jury charge, violated defendant's First Amendment or other constitutional rights.\\"People v. Golb, 102 A.D.3d 601, 601-02, 960 N.Y.S.2d 66, 68 (1st Dep't 2013). The court refused to interpret the definitions of \\"injure\\" or \\"defraud\\", as used in the forgery and criminal impersonation statutes, to \\"tangible harms such as financial harm.\\" It also ruled that the requirement in the statute of \\"benefit\\" could be \\"any gain or advantage\\" to defendant or \\"to another person,\\" such as defendant's father. \\"The fact that the underlying dispute between defendant and his father's rivals was a constitutionally- protected debate does not provide any First Amendment protection for acts that were otherwise unlawful.\\" The court emphasized that the wrongfulness of Golb's conduct was not in the content of what he said but in his use of sock puppetry: \\"Defendant was not prosecuted for the content of any of the emails, but only for giving the false impression that his victims were the actual authors of the emails.\\"102 A.D.3d at 602-03, 960 N.Y.S.2d at 68. The Appellate Division overturned the identity theft conviction in the second degree, which was based on the theory that Golb attempted to commit the felony of scheme to defraud in the first degree, which means defrauding someone of $1000 or more in property. The court said that \\"there was no evidence that defendant intended to defraud one or more persons of property in excess of $1,000 or that he attempted to do so. The People's assertions in this regard rest on speculation.\\"102 A.D.3d at 603, 960 N.Y.S.2d at 69. 2014 ruling of Court of Appeals Golb appealed to the highest New York court, the Court of Appeals, and in a split decision it further modified the convictions but affirmed them in part. Judge Sheila Abdus-Salaam wrote the majority opinion, joined by Judges Victoria A. Graffeo, Susan Phillips Read, Robert S. Smith, Eugene F. Pigott Jr., and Jenny Rivera. Chief Judge Jonathan Lippman dissented in part.People v. Golb, 23 N.Y.3d 455, 991 N.Y.S.2d 792, 15 N.E.3d 805 (2014). Majority opinion =The counts for criminal impersonation in the second degree= Golb was convicted of 14 counts of criminal impersonation in the second degree. NY Penal Law ¬ß 190.25[1] makes guilty of this crime a person who \\"impersonates another and does an act in such assumed character with intent to obtain a benefit or to injure or defraud another.\\" Golb argued that the trial court's failure to properly limit and define the terms \\"injure\\" and \\"benefit\\" constituted reversible error because the jury could have interpreted the statute as capturing any benefit or harm. Thus, \\"when literally anything can be a legally cognizable benefit or harm, one can be found guilty of violating this law if one, for example, simply causes hurt feelings, mocks or criticizes\\" and \\"a benefit could be any gain or advantage, no matter how slight.\\" Prior cases, however, applied the statute only to cases that involved monetary fraud or interference with government operations. Golb did not cause any pecuniary loss or interfere with governmental operations, the court said, but his acts did involve injury to reputation, which in academia can be serious, \\"and we believe the legislature intended that the scope of the statute be broad enough to capture acts intended to cause injury to reputation.\\" Accordingly, the court concluded: > [A] person who impersonates someone with the intent to harm the reputation > of another may be found guilty of this crime. Here, there was sufficient > evidence to support the jury's finding that defendant's emails impersonating > Schiffman, Seidel and Cross were more than a prank intended to cause > temporary embarrassment or discomfiture, and that he acted with intent to do > real harm.23 N.Y.3d at 464-66, 991 N.Y.S.2d at 798-800, 15 N.E.3d at 811-13. The court emphasized, however, that criminalization depends on intent to cause injury: > [T]he mere creation of email accounts in the names of Schiffman, Seidel, > Goranson and Cross (in contrast to the use of those accounts to send emails) > does not constitute criminal conduct under Penal Law ¬ß 190.25. The mere > creation of email accounts that are not used does no substantial harm to > anyone. Additionally, the email sent from the Seidel email address to Dr. > Kohn, asking her opinion on the differing theories about the Scrolls and > whether she was planning to answer Professor Golb's critique, is > insufficient to support a conviction for criminal impersonation in the > second degree. Unlike the other emails, this email sent in another person's > name does not prove the requisite intent to cause injury, either to > reputation or otherwise. Thus, we vacate the convictions on those counts.23 > N.Y.3d 455, 466, 991 N.Y.S.2d 792, 800, 15 N.E.3d 805, 813. =The aggravated harassment charge= New York Penal Law ¬ß 240.30(1)(a) provides that \\"[a] person is guilty of aggravated harassment in the second degree when, with intent to harass, annoy, threaten or alarm another person, he or she ... communicates with a person, anonymously or otherwise, by telephone, by telegraph, or by mail, or by transmitting or delivering any other form of written communication, in a manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm.\\" The court agreed with Golb that this statute is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, and that his conviction of three counts of aggravated harassment related to his conduct toward Schiffman, Goranson and Cargill must therefore be vacated. The court ruled that \\"any proscription of pure speech must be sharply limited to words which, by their utterance alone, inflict injury or tend naturally to evoke immediate violence.\\"23 N.Y.3d at 466-67, 991 N.Y.S.2d at 800, 15 N.E.3d at 813. = The convictions for forgery in the third degree, identity theft in the second degree, and unauthorized use of a computer= New York Penal Law ¬ß 170.05 provides \\"A person is guilty of forgery in the third degree when, with intent to defraud, deceive or injure another, he falsely makes, completes or alters a written instrument.\\" The court found that there was sufficient evidence to show that defendant deceived people by sending emails from accounts in the names of Schiffman, Seidel and Cross, and accordingly it affirmed his conviction on those counts.23 N.Y.3d at 468, 991 N.Y.S.2d at 801, 15 N.E.3d at 814. But the court vacated the convictions on the counts of unauthorized use of a computer and identity theft in the second degree. Penal Law ¬ß 156.05 makes guilty of unauthorized use of a computer a person who \\"knowingly uses, causes to be used, or accesses a computer, computer service, or computer network without authorization.\\" The term \\"without authorization\\" is defined as \\"to access a computer ... without the permission of the owner ... or after actual notice to such person that such use or access was without permission.\\" Golb pointed out that he had permission to access the NYU computers as an NYU alumnus. The prosecution argued that using the computer to commit a crime cannot be an \\"authorized\\" use. However, the court ruled, the wording of the statute and the legislative history indicate that the statute is intended to reach a person who accesses a computer system without any permission (i.e., a hacker) and the statutory language thus does not apply to Golb's conduct here. \\"Thus, the People did not sustain their burden of proof that defendant was guilty of unauthorized use of the NYU computers, and we therefore vacate defendant's conviction under Penal Law ¬ß 156.05.\\" Last, under Penal Law ¬ß 190.79[3], a person commits identity theft in the second degree \\"when he or she knowingly and with intent to defraud assumes the identity of another person by presenting himself or herself as that other person, or by acting as that other person or by using personal identifying information of that other person, and thereby ... commits or attempts to commit a felony.\\" The attempted felony of which the prosecution accused Golb was first-degree falsifying of the business records of NYU, a crime that is committed when a person \\"commits the crime of falsifying business records in the second degree, and when his intent to defraud includes an intent to commit another crime or to aid or conceal the commission thereof.\\" Here the allegation is that Golb sought to falsify NYU business records by \\"manufacturing a subtle admission of plagiarism purportedly from Schiffman, with the intent that NYU would open an investigation of Schiffman.\\" But the false emails that Golb sent in Schiffman's name to NYU addresses did not constitute the creation or falsification of an NYU business record that is \\"kept or maintained by an enterprise for the purpose of evidencing or reflecting its condition or activity.\\" The court concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support this conviction, so that it must be vacated.23 N.Y.3d at 468-69, 991 N.Y.S.2d at 801-02, 15 N.E.3d at 814-15. Lippman dissent Chief Judge Jonathan Lippman saw no general constitutional impediment to prosecuting conduct similar to defendant's targeting Schiffman as second degree identity theft‚Äî\\"which requires for its proof evidence of intent to cause highly specific injury of a non-reputational sort‚Äîbut concluded that the particular counts of identity theft with which defendant was charged in the indictment\\" counts were not sufficiently proved under that standard. Lippman agreed with the court in vacating parts of the conviction. \\"I, however, part company with the majority as to its dismissal of only some of the indictment's criminal impersonation counts and its determination to leave defendant's third-degree forgery convictions undisturbed.\\"23 N.Y.3d at 469-70, 991 N.Y.S.2d at 802, 15 N.E.3d at 815. Lippman disagreed with the majority on interpreting second-degree criminal impersonation under Penal Law ¬ß 190.25 to cover reputational injury as well as impersonation intended to cause economic injury or to interfere with government operations. In his view that interpretation criminalized such a vast amount of speech that it violated the First Amendment.23 N.Y.3d at 470, 991 N.Y.S.2d at 802, 15 N.E.3d at 815. Lippman found the use of the third- degree forgery statute (Penal Law ¬ß 170.05) to the same end as the criminal impersonation statute \\"similarly objectionable.\\" To treat sock puppetry (or pseudonymous emails) as forgeries \\"when they are made with some intent to injure in some undefined way is no different than penalizing impersonation in Internet communication for the same amorphous purpose.\\" In his view: > Both treatments give prosecutors power they should not have to determine > what speech should and should not be penalized. If defendant has caused > reputational injury, that is redressable, if at all, as a civil tort, not as > a crime. Criminal libel has long since been abandoned, not least of all > because of its tendency in practice to penalize and chill speech that the > constitution protects, and it has been decades since New York's criminal > libel statute was repealed. The use of the criminal impersonation and > forgery statutes now approved amounts to an atavism at odds with the First > Amendment and the free and uninhibited exchange of ideas it is meant to > foster. I would dismiss the indictment in its entirety.23 N.Y.3d at 471, 991 > N.Y.S.2d at 803, 15 N.E.3d at 816. Subsequent proceedings The United States Supreme Court denied certiorari.Golb v. New York, 135 S. Ct. 1009 (2015). Golb then moved the trial court for a new trial, but it denied the motion because he had not made it before his original sentencing. However, the court resentenced him to two months instead of the original six months. He then appealed but the Appellate Division held that it would be procedurally \\"improper to consider or review\\" Golb's challenges regarding his conviction.People v. Golb, 126 A.D.3d 401, 5 N.Y.S.3d 46, 47 (1st Dep't 2015). The Court of Appeals then declined to review the Appellate Division's decision.People v. Golb, 26 N.Y.3d 929, 17 N.Y.S.3d 92, 38 N.E.3d 838 (2015). Golb's two-month sentence was stayed, however, pending resolution of habeas corpus litigation. Golb then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 2254 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, in which he challenged his remaining convictions for criminal impersonation in the second degree and forgery in the third degree.Golb v. Attorney General of New York, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7774 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 21, 2016). Since 1996, a federal court cannot grant a petition for a writ of habeas corpus based on a claim that was \\"adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings\\" unless a state court's decision: # \\"was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\\"; or # \\"was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\\"Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996#Habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 2254(d). The district court noted that this is a \\"highly deferential standard for evaluating state-court rulings, which demands that state-court decisions be given the benefit of the doubt.\\"2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7774, at *23 (citing Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.S. 170, 181 (2011)) Accordingly, the district court ruled that the court would have to give deference to the New York Court of Appeals ruling that Golb was not entitled to a new trial on constitutional grounds. Golb argued that the trial court had convicted him under laws that the appellate court found unconstitutional, so that there was no way to tell whether he would have been convicted if the trial court had applied the narrower, constitutional construction of the relevant statutes. But the district court responded that this principle applies only when earlier overbreadth would have adversely affected the outcome of the defendant's case. Applying that standard resulted in a conclusion that Golb was entitled to a new trial on two counts of criminal impersonation in the second degree, but not on the other seven criminal impersonation in the second degree nor on the ten counts of forgery in the third degree.2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7774, at *31. The New York Court of Appeals held that the statutory terms \\"injure\\" and \\"benefit\\" could not be construed to apply to any slight injury or benefit; instead, an intent to cause \\"real harm\\" or \\"substantial harm\\" must be shown. Therefore, \\"the Court of Appeals should have considered whether: (i) the overbroad statute gave Petitioner adequate notice that his conduct would be considered criminal; and (ii) the overbreadth of the jury instructions in Petitioner's case was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\\" Counts 33 and 37 of the indictment alleged that Golb committed criminal impersonation in the second degree when he sent emails from the account of \\"seidel.jonathan@gmail.com\\" to dozens of Dead Sea Scrolls scholars on November 24 and December 6, 2008; these emails described Professor Golb's views as \\"filth,\\" and asked if anyone \\"could help prepare a response.\\" Then Golb sent other emails suggesting that he was counting on Jonathan Seidel's good name to help persuade the Toronto Museum to consider Professor Golb's work. The district court said that a properly instructed jury might not find that Golb sent the November 24 and December 6 emails to damage Jonathan Seidel's reputation or to cause any other kind of \\"substantial harm,\\" given the other emails relying on Seidel's good name. The district court therefore held that \\"the Court finds that the overbroad jury instructions 'had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict' on Counts 33 and 37\\" and Golb \\"is therefore entitled to a new trial on these two counts.\\"2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7774, at *33-*36. On the other counts. the district court saw no reversible error. Counts 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 25, and 46 of the indictment alleged that Golb committed criminal impersonation in the second degree by sending five emails as Lawrence Schiffman, one email as Jonathan Seidel, and one as Frank Moore Cross. Golb \\"confessed\\" in these emails that he (as Schiffman) was guilty of plagiarism, which would likely cause him to be fired from his academic post. Another email could be seen as an attempt to secure a job opportunity for his father or \\"was attempting to persuade the [museum] to offer his father an opportunity to lecture on the Dead Sea Scrolls.\\" The overbroad jury instructions for these counts, the district court said, \\"were in fact harmless 'beyond a reasonable doubt,' and, a fortiori, did not have a 'substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict', [so that] no new trial is warranted.\\"2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7774, at *36-39, 42. Count 46 alleged that Golb sent an email purporting to be from Frank Cross to four scholars at the University of North Carolina, where Bart Ehrman worked. The clear implication of this email was that Ehrman's professional opinions were so off-base that they were embarrassing to Frank Cross, who was a well-known Dead Sea Scrolls scholar. A properly instructed jury could find that Golb sent the email to Ehrman's colleagues with an intent to cause substantial harm to Ehrman's reputation.2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7774, at *43. The district court held that Golb was not entitled to a new trial on the forgery counts for a different reason. It rejected Golb's claim that the Court of Appeals had narrowed the forgery statute to cases of substantial harm. It found \\"no indication that the Court intended to limit the reach of the forgery statute to cases in which a defendant intends to cause substantial harm.\\" Therefore, Golb was not convicted under a subsequently narrowed statute.2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7774, at *46. While the district court rejected Golb's claim that the statutes were overbroad on their face, it noted that it was not ruling, because Golb did not so argue, that they were not overbroad as applied to the specific conduct involved here. It said: \\"One could argue that certain of the emails at issue, such as the email to Dr. Kohn, were not intended to cause substantial harms (to reputation or otherwise), and as such were more protected by the First Amendment than punishable under section 170.05. However, Petitioner did not make this argument, and the Court will not make it for him.\\"2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7774, at *59 n.7. Golb sought to argue that he should have been allowed to prove that his charges (plagiarism, etc.) were true, \\"inasmuch as he was charged with committing a crime by making statements that were calculated to injure someone's reputation.\\" The district court held that Golb's claim \\"was procedurally defaulted\\" because he did not present it properly in the Appellate Division or Court of Appeals. He asserted only the state constitution and not the federal Constitution. \\"Consequently, New York State courts did not have a fair opportunity to consider\\" Golb's First Amendment rights.2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7774, at *65. The district court held, on January 21, 2016, \\"Petitioner's convictions on Counts 33 and 37 are reversed; the other convictions remain.\\"2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7774, at *66. Disbarment Golb was a member of the New York Bar. The Appellate Division held that because he \\"was convicted, after a jury trial, of identity theft in the second degree (two counts) in violation of Penal Law ¬ß 190.79 (3), a class E felony,\\" he should be disbarred.Matter of Golb, 81 A.D.3d 53, 54, 913 N.Y.S.2d 917, 918 (1st Dep't 2011). Commentary UCLA Professor Eugene Volokh, in the Volokh Conspiracy blog, maintained that Golb's conviction was \\"quite right, even after United States v. Alvarez (the Stolen Valor Act case).\\" Volokh insisted: > Intentionally trying to make others believe that someone did something > (write an e-mail) that he did not inflicts specific harm on that other > person, whether by harming his reputation or at least by making others think > that he believes something that he doesn't (which will often be civilly > actionable under the false light tort). To be sure, that usually leads to > civil liability, but nothing in the Court's decision suggests that criminal > liability in such cases is impermissible, especially when the law is limited > to relatively clearly identifiable falsehoods, such as falsely claiming to > be someone you are not. Citing the Restatement (Second) of Torts ¬ß 652E, Volokh concluded that \\"it seems to me that such impersonation is therefore indeed unprotected‚Äîas I said, against criminal punishment as well as civil liability.\\"Eugene Volokh, No First Amendment Violation in E-Mail Impersonation Case, (Jan. 29, 2013). Scott Greenfield, commenting on the Court of Appeals decision in the Simple Justice blog, said, \\"That there hasn't been huge interest in the trial and appeal of Raphael Golb remains a mystery to me,\\" which he found \\"sad given that the case is fascinating\\" and that \\"the legal implications of the case for the rest of the internet are huge.\\" He applauded the ruling that the harassment law was unconstitutional, but criticized the application of the criminal impersonation law to non-\\"slight\\" reputational injury because the majority opinion \\"offers no guidance on how to distinguish 'real' reputational injury from other injury, no matter how slight.\\" He maintained that \\"when injury is based on subjective bases, feelings, it's reduced to a game of rhetoric, who can make up a compelling Queen for a Day story of misery and heartache, and will a judge will be sufficiently empathetic to feel the pain.\\" Greenfield criticised Volokh for significantly undervaluing Golb's parody claim for his gmail messages. \\"Neither the court nor Eugene recognize that professors sending serious emails don't use gmail accounts, or make outlandish confessions of wrongdoing.\\" Greenfield argued that it is irrelevant that Schiffman \\"found nothing funny about the emails. So what? The targets of parody rarely do.\\" He further argued: > The Court implicitly holds that what Golb did was not parody, because > neither the judges, the prosecutor, nor targets like Schiffman thought it > was funny.

In an earlier issue of his Simple Justice blog, Greenfield asserted that \\"the whole First Amendment aspect of the case fell through the cracks\\" the way the case was tried, because the trial judge first postponed determination of First Amendment issues until trial and then said that she had already denied them. He quoted Golb's lawyer as saying that the court \\"made hurting somebody's feelings a criminal act,\\" but in New York \\"hurting people's feelings or being annoying is not a crime\\"; it is just normal daily behavior. After quoting a comment by Schiffman on the conviction‚Äî\\"Let us hope that the field of Dead Sea Scrolls research can get back to its real business‚Äîinterpreting the ancient scrolls and explaining their significance for the history of Judaism and the background of early Christianity\\"‚ÄîGreenfield responded that Schiffman has \\"disgraced himself amongst the Dead Sea Scroll scholars by using a criminal prosecution to shut down his most vocal critic. He's now disgraced himself again within the academic community by ignoring that the issue arose from his having shut out Norman Golb from the scholarly dialogue, even denying Golb access to the scrolls lest he find something that undercuts Schiffman's claims.\\" Greenfield said he was not concerned with the implications for Dead Sea Scroll studies, but with the \\"broad and disastrous\\" implications of the conviction for the Internet: > If playing with a sock puppet on the internet, no harm done beyond some hurt > feelings, is enough to land you in prison, we've got a lot of potential > felons out there taking some major risks for a few laughs or to get the > upper hand in an argument.

A 2013 New York Times article was critical of Golb, calling him \\"an online troll, stirring up controversy.\\" The writer asks whether Golb is \\"really a cybercriminal, or just a particularly noxious partisan in a constitutionally protected academic debate, using guerrilla methods to advance a minority viewpoint?\\"John Leland, Online Battle Over Sacred Scrolls, Real-World Consequences (Feb. 16, 2013). A 2012 comment in The Guardian asserted, \\"The case of Raphael Golb shows the real invasive power and perfidy of sock puppets.\\" The comment alleges that Golb authored sock puppet accounts in Wikipedia, among other sites, \\"and then referenced back to these items to give the appearance of proper referencing, peer review and a growing body of academic acceptance for the ideas of his father.\\" Arguing against the harmlessness of sock puppetry as \\"a form of free expression that should be protected and with the exception of egregious cases like Golb,\\" the commentator insists: > The problem with sock puppetry is that academic discourse relies upon peer > review and on active intellectual debate.

Tablet asserts that \\"in recent years a subtle shift has occurred: Golb's theory has begun to approach the status of received wisdom,\\" and \\"[m]any scholars seem now to be in agreement that some, many, or even most of the scrolls were not of sectarian origin\\" and came from Jerusalem.

In an editorial published in the Forward, Arthur S. Hayes, professor of communication and media studies at Fordham University, asserts that Raphael Golb was convicted for an \\"act of satire\\", and that \\"Golb never should have had to face criminal charges ... no critic should serve prison time because he intended to, or in fact did, disparage others, even if he does so by posing as someone else. That is a reasonable principle to draw from more than fifty years of First Amendment jurisprudence.

Born a slave, he became a dental assistant and Underground Railroad conductor in Norfolk, Virginia, before escaping to New Bedford, Massachusetts, where he changed his name to Thomas Bayne. Returning to Norfolk after the American Civil War, Bayne worked as a dentist and also preached; he became a leader in the African American community. He was elected a delegate to the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1868 as a Republican, but was never again elected to another office.Cynthia Miller Leonard, The General Assembly of Virginia: July 30, 1619-January 11, 1978 (Richmond: Virginia State Library 1978) p 508 Early and family life Bayne said he was born enslaved in North Carolina as Samuel Nixon. He escaped in 1844 but was recaptured after a year, then sold to Charles F. Martin, a dentist in Norfolk, Virginia. Dr Martin appreciated his intelligence and trained him as his assistant, eventually allowing him to keep the practice's books as well as make house calls to clients. Nixon married a woman named Edna in Norfolk, who gave birth to a daughter. Using his freedom to move around the port city, Nixon became a conductor on the Underground Railroad. Eventually, after serving the dentist for about ten years, Nixon became fearful that he would be caught. He took passage on a northbound ship, leaving his wife and child behind. Escape and Massachusetts Nixon disembarked at Salem, New Jersey, a rural port town across the Delaware River near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He received shelter from Quaker conductor Abigail Goodwin, who wrote to her Philadelphia contacts that Nixon was bright but also a braggart. While she suspected he might be a spy rather than a legitimate escapee, she nonetheless outfitted him and notified Benjamin Lundy and her other Philadelphia contacts, whom Nixon soon contacted and who sent him further north.William Still, pp. 256-259, available at https://archive.org/stream/undergroundrailr00stil/undergroundrailr00stil_djvu.txt Although advised to travel to Canada, Nixon determined to settle in New Bedford, Massachusetts, where he arrived by 1856.National Park Service, New Bedford Lesso Plan Journey 2 begins at p. 53 at https://www.nps.gov/subjects/ugrr/education/upload/findingfreedom.pdf There, he changed his name to Thomas Bayne and soon had a thriving dental practice in the Northern port city. In 1860, Bayne was elected to New Bedford's city council, with the support of local Republicans and temperance advocates. Postwar years in Virginia By May, 1865, Bayne had returned to Norfolk and located his daughter, whom he sent to Massachusetts. The following month, he made a speech extolling equal suffrage in Norfolk. However, unlike Frederick Douglass, Bayne opposed women's suffrage, preaching that women's basic right is to raise and bear children.Eric Foner, Reconstruction 1863-1877 (Harper & Row 1988), p. 87. In January 1866, Bayne attended the Colored National Convention in Washington, D.C., serving as vice president of the convention which lobbied Congress not to readmit the former Confederate states before assuring that the rights of African Americans would be honored. On February 3, 1866, Bayne testified before a subcommittee of the Congressional Joint Committee on Reconstruction about the harsh conditions in postwar Virginia. The Radical Republicans in Congress soon imposed Congressional Reconstruction, including military rule, on Virginia. On January 7, 1867, President Andrew Johnson vetoed the District of Columbia Negro suffrage bill, prompting Radical Republicans including James M. Ashley of Ohio to begin impeachment investigations. Three months later, on April 17, 1867, Union Republicans met in Richmond and elected Bayne as their convention's vice president, as they planned for the upcoming Virginia Constitutional Convention, since Congress had conditioned readmission of Virginia and other Confederate states upon adopting new constitutions which did not permit slavery and which did permit African Americans to vote. On October 22, 1867, Norfolk voters elected Bayne and Unionist Democrat Henry M. Bowden (1819-1871)Encyclopedia Virginia/Bowden to represent their city in the upcoming state constitutional convention. The Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1868 first met on December 3, 1867 (the same day the 40th U.S. Congress convened), and Bayne was assigned to the Committee on Rules and Regulations and the Committee on the Executive Department of Government. However, the delegates soon adjourned until January. Conservative Virginians had begun meeting in Richmond on December 11, led by Alexander H. H. Stuart of Staunton to select candidates opposed to whatever the convention would produce; some were particularly offended by the presence of African-American delegates, though their numbers were small, and some white voters had deliberately not voted in the October elections to elect constitutional convention delegates. By December 13, the Richmond Enquirer was lampooning the Convention's African Americans.Henry p. 284 The Constitutional Convention reconvened on January 2, 1868, and Bayne was perhaps the most powerful or outspoken African-American. He wanted to disenfranchise Confederates, as well as limit poll taxes in favor of high land taxes that could break up large estates, and was also among the minority who wanted to integrate public schools (public schools being an innovation in the constitution).Foner pp. 311, 322, 327, available at digitalcommons.odu.edu Bayne also supported a resolution to continue the Freedmen's Bureau in Virginia, although seemingly outside the convention's mandate.Michlael Hucles, \\"Many Voices, Similar Concerns2, The Virginia Magazine, p. 554. On March 24, a fellow delegate offered a resolution limiting Bayne to five speeches per day. On April 17, 1868, the convention adjourned after passing a proposed constitution (and a controversial confederate disenfranchisement clause) by a vote of 51 to 36. Originally, the convention began with 105 members, of whom 72 were Radicals (including 25 African Americans), and 33 Conservatives.Robert Selph Henry, The Story of Reconstruction (New York: Grosset & Dunlap, 1938), p. 283. On July 6, 1869, the Radical Republicans nominated Bayne as their candidate to Congress from the Second Congressional District. He lost to James H. Platt, Jr., whom Petersburg's voters had sent to the Constitutional Convention as their delegate. Bayne appealed to Congress, but no-one wanted to enforce the new constitution's rejected clause which would have disenfranchised Confederates and their sympathizers. Moreover, months after federal troops left in early 1870, Conservatives won Norfolk's local election in May. John B. Whitehead defeated Radical Peter Dilworth, and Conservatives took over Norfolk's city council, although four blacks won city council seats.Thomas C. Parramore, Peter C. Stewart, Norfolk: the First 400 Centuries (University of Virginia Press), p. 237. Bayne had been nominated by the Radicals for Commissioner of the Revenue, but voters elected Conservative Republican A.K. Hill, Esq.H.W. Burton, The History of Norfolk, Virginia (Norfolk Virginian, 1877) p. 134 available at internet archive Bayne later ran for the post of physician to the almshouse. However, he lost a debate with Joseph T. Wilson, another African American and who had been running for customs officer and inspector, and whom the Norfolk Virginian considered the community's new negro leader.Hucles, pp. 560, 564, citing Norfolk Virginian, May 10, 1870, and January 29, 1873. However, Bayne continued in Norfolk. The censuses of 1870 and 1880 show him as living alone, with his status as widower noted on the latter. Death and legacy In July 1887, Bayne wrote a will, leaving his property to his daughter and her children. The following May, he was admitted to the Central State Lunatic Asylum, in Petersburg. On July 7, the Norfolk Public Ledger published a postcard from the asylum's superintendent, indicating the dentist \\"Dr.\\" Thomas Bayne, formerly politically prominent \\"with his race\\", had died two days before. He was buried at Norfolk's West Point Cemetery.findagrave citing The Public Ledger, July 7, 188 8http://www.findagrave.com/cgi- bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GSln;=bayne&GSfn;=thomas&GSby;=1820&GSbyrel;=in&GSdy;=1888&GSdyrel;=in&GSst;=48&GScntry;=4&GSob;=n&GRid;=73950769&df;=all& However, Virginia maintained no record of his death, as Bain, Bayne or Nixon.

Following the bombing, Qasim‚Äôs 2015 trip to Qatar became the subject of a controversy over alleged Qatari ties to the terrorist attack.  Background  Mohab Mostafa Al Sayed Qasim was born on November 2, 1986 in Egypt. His brother, Mohsen El Sayed Qasim, was born in December 1981 and was a member of the terrorist cell led by Mohab Qasim responsible for carrying out the Botroseya Church bombing. Mohab Mostafa Al Sayed Qasim‚Äôs \\"militant name\\" is \\"The Doctor.\\"  Terrorist attack  On December 11, 2016, a suicide bomber killed 27 people and injured 47 others after detonating a bomb at St. Peter and St. Paul‚Äôs Church in Cairo. The suicide bomber was later identified as Mahmoud Shafiq Mohammed Mustafa. According to a statement made by Egypt‚Äôs Ministry of Interior, Mustafa belonged to a terrorist cell led by Mohab Qasim. Egyptian police conducted a raid on the terrorist cell‚Äôs hideout in Cairo‚Äôs Zeitoun district on December 12, 2016. During the raid, authorities arrested four members of the cell and found two explosive belts and other materials used to make explosives. The arrested members of the terrorist cell led by Mohab Qasim were identified as Ramy Mohamed Abdel-Ghany and his wife Ola Hussein Ali, Mohamed Hamdy Abdel- Ghany, and the brother of Mohab Qasim, Mohsen El Sayed Qasim. Ramy Mohamed Abdel-Ghany is suspected of having provided refuge for suicide bomber Mahmoud Mustafa as well as preparing him and hiding the explosives. The Muslim Brotherhood denied involvement with the suicide attack. ISIS later claimed responsibility for the attack.  Controversy between Egypt and Qatar  The statement issued by Egypt‚Äôs Ministry of Interior claimed that Mohab Qasim received financial and logistical support from Muslim Brotherhood leaders based in Qatar. According to the statement, Qasim traveled to Qatar in 2015 and met with Muslim Brotherhood leaders.[xii] Qasim was allegedly offered financial and logistical support to carry out attacks in Egypt. Upon returning to Egypt, Qasim reportedly traveled to North Sinai where he met with members of Ansar Beit El-Maqdis to receive training on using weapons and making explosives. Following his visit to North Sinai, Qasim was allegedly given permission by Qatar-based Muslim Brotherhood leaders to carry out attacks against Egypt‚Äôs Coptic Christians in hopes of furthering sectarian divides in Egypt. The Ministry of the Interior claimed that Qasim was behind a call made by the Egyptian Revolutionary Council for attacks against Egypt‚Äôs Copts for their support for the government of Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.  GCC and Qatari response  The Secretary-General of the Gulf Cooperation Council, Abdullatif bin Rashid Al Zayani, condemned Egypt‚Äôs accusations of Qatari involvement in the suicide attack on Thursday, December 15. Al Zayani claimed that \\"unverified statements could harm the strong relations between the GCC and Egypt.\\" Qatar‚Äôs Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Director of the Qatari Information Office Ahmed Al-Rumaihi condemned Egypt‚Äôs accusations. In a statement reported by the Qatar News Agency (QNA), Al Rumaihi acknowledged that Qasim arrived in Qatar on December 3, 2015 on an entry visit visa, but claimed that Qatari authorities did not receive a request to detain the suspect or prevent him from entering Qatar. Ahmed Al Rumaihi also stated that the State of Qatar \\"rejects terrorism in all its forms regardless of its motives, as well as Qatar‚Äôs rejection to any threat to the security of the Egyptian people.\\" References 1986 births Living people Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood members ","title":"Mohab Mostafa Al Sayed Qasim"},{"id":"52851830","text":"Arubans in the Netherlands consist of migrants from Aruba to the Netherlands and their descendants.

The exact origin of the \\"Cool S\\" is unknown, but it may have originated from geometry textbooks and has appeared around the early 1970s as a part of graffiti culture. Contrary to popular belief, the symbol has no ties to either the U.S. clothing brand St√ºssy or to the character Superman, though St√ºssy did conduct an interview in 2010 with Jon Naar, a pioneer graffiti photographer with many works including this S, dating back to the 1970s. Shape The \\"Cool S\\" consists of 14 line segments, forming a stylized, pointed S-shape. It has also been compared to the infinity symbol. The \\"tails\\" (pointy ends) of the S appear to link underneath so that it loops around on itself in the same way as the infinity symbol does. The \\"Cool S\\" has no reflection symmetry, but has 2-fold rotational symmetry.

The original school was named for Thomas Corcoran, former mayor of Georgetown, and was developed to accommodate the Caucasian population in the area. The school comprises approximately 24,000 square feet total and sits on a lot that extends down to M Street.  History  Located at 28th and M Streets NW, the building was originally developed as an elementary school in 1889 and operated in that capacity for sixty-two years. It was named after former Georgetown mayor, Thomas Corcoran. Thomas Corcoran's son was William Wilson Corcoran, founder of the well-known Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. It was built as a school for Caucasian children in the area and ran successfully until the mid-1900s because of inability to keep the school full. The school board made the decision to close the school in 1947, but reversed its decision a year later \\"until it can be determined if extensive building and remodeling of homes in Georgetown will result in increased school attendance by white children\\". The school ultimately closed in 1950. Following closure of the school, the city used the building for administrative purposes. In 1981, the city attempted to auction the building off but was unsuccessful, until the Hotel and Restaurant Workers Union purchased it for $1.8 million at an auction in 1982.  Hotel and Restaurant Workers Union  The labor union, now known as UNITE HERE, purchased the building in 1982 to be used as its international headquarters. It outbid Royce Lanier, an architect hoping to restore or lease the school. The Union was founded in 1891 and merged with the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE) in 2004 to become UNITE HERE.  American Road & Transportation Builders Association  In 2005, the American Road & Transportation Builders Association (ARTBA) purchased the building from the Hotel and Restaurant Workers Union for $7.3 million. ARTBA was founded in 1902 and lists on its website that it is \\"the oldest and most respected national transportation construction-related association\\".  State of Qatar Ministry of Defense  The government of the Qatar, specifically the Qatar Ministry of Defense, purchased the building from ARTBA on December 15, 2016. [x] The final sale price was approximately $17 million. The purchase follows a pattern of recent Qatari-related investments in Washington, D.C. The Club Quarters Hotel was purchased by Doha-based Al Sraiya Holding Group for $52.4 million in early 2016. Prior to that, \\"Duwaliya US Real Estate Inc. bought 1575 Eye St. NW for $107.9 million about a year ago, the Al Rayyan Tourism Investment Co. bought the St. Regis in 2015 for about $82 million, and the Qatar Investment Authority financed a large portion of CityCenterDC\\".

During the same period the USN also performed multiple other FONOPs in other parts of the world. The SCS operations involved Arleigh-Burke Class Guided Missile Destroyers assigned to United States Seventh Fleet. The U.S. FONOP program began in 1979 and the Department of Defense (DoD) keeps public records of FONOPs since 1991 on its website. The Department of State (DoS) provided guidance to the DoD on conducting FONOPs, with a particular focus on the South China Sea and East China Sea, while pushing back on the People's Republic of China and their \\"excessive territorial claims\\", specifically with the Spratly Islands, Paracel Islands, and Senkaku Islands.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army (Navy) had established a significant presence in vicinity of the Paracel (Xisha) Islands through their own FONOPs prior to their confrontation with Vietnam during the Battle of the Paracel Islands in 1974. According to Chinese Law, specifically the 1992 Territorial Sea/Contiguous Zone (1992 TS/CZ) Law, China has full ownership of the Paracel Islands, which has created tension with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the Republic of China (Taiwan). In 1983, President Ronald Reagan declared that the U.S. would not ratify the 1982 Third United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III). China signed and ratified UNCLOS III in 1996. Nevertheless, the U.S. Navy- under the Obama Administration- has operated in accordance with UNCLOS III with the use of innocent passage, proper communications, and respect for nations' territorial waters. Throughout Obama's presidency, the US Navy's Seventh Fleet routinely patrolled the Indo- Asia-Pacific to maintain the freedom of seas United States Pacific Fleet vessels spent a combined total of 700 days in the South China Sea during 2015 alone. This includes vessels assigned to Carrier Strike Group 5, which included the until the summer of 2015, at which point the USS Ronald Reagan (CVN-76) took its place in the homeport of Yokosuka, Japan after a hull swap in San Diego, CA. The Hague ‚Äì International Tribunal's 2016 ruling On July 12, 2016, the Hague's International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea ruled in the Permanent Court of Arbitration that the People's Republic of China's claims were excessive and violated the Republic of Philippines' sovereignty when they. The Philippines filed the case on 22 January 2013 with a strong backing from President Benigno Aquino. Although the Obama Administration did not overtly back the Philippines in the case, President Obama and Secretary John Kerry did publicly express support for the right of sovereign nations to follow international law and norms and to dispute disagreements in the legal and appropriate forums, although emphasizing that since the US is not a claimant they are a neutral party. China declared that it did not recognize the jurisdiction of the tribunal prior to proceedings, and requested the Philippines to do the same. Meanwhile, the Obama Administration continued to urge all nations to follow international law and abide by the ruling for the remainder of Obama's presidency. Military exercises with SCS island claimants and the United States Claimants to the South China Sea island disputes include Brunei, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. Although the US is neutral in the disputes, the American military participates in training exercises with each claimant.

It is the first of four seasonal ‚Äòstate of the nation‚Äô works. Written rapidly after the United Kingdom's 2016 European Union membership referendum, it was widely regarded as the first 'post-Brexit novel' dealing with the issues raised by the voters' decision. In July 2017, Autumn was longlisted for the 2017 Man Booker Prize for Fiction and in September 2017 it was announced as one of six books to make the shortlist. Many newspapers viewed it as the most likely candidate for winning. The book was named by The New York Times as one of the 10 Best Books of 2017. Plot Daniel Gluck, a 101-year-old former songwriter, lies asleep and dreaming in his care home. He is regularly visited by 32-year-old Elisabeth Demand, who had been his next door neighbour as a young child. Her mother had disapproved of their early friendship, based on her belief that Daniel was gay, but Elisabeth had nevertheless formed a close bond with him and been inspired by his descriptions of works of art. As a consequence of his influence on her, Elisabeth is now a junior arts lecturer at a London university. A major character in the novel is the long-dead '60s pop artist, Pauline Boty,https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/first-post-brexit-novel the subject of Elisabeth's graduate school thesis. The story largely alternates between Daniel's prolonged dreams as he edges closer to death, and Elisabeth's recollections of the origins of their friendship and its repercussions. Publication Autumn was published on 20 October 2016, less than four months after the UK's European Union membership referendum. Talking about the work's origins, and its three projected sequels, Smith said: > \\"I've been thinking about writing a seasonal series of books for about 20 > years now, and in 2014, after finishing How to Be Both, I realised it was > time to start. This might simply be because I knew now it was possible, > after Hamish Hamilton made such a beautiful finished book-form for How to be > Both in a matter of weeks (!), to turn a book around quite speedily compared > to the usual time it takes, and this excited me about how closely to > contemporaneousness a finished book might be able to be in the world, and > yet how it could also be, all through, very much about stratified, cyclic > time.\\" Critical reception Writing in The Guardian, Joanna Kavenna wrote, \\"I think Smith is writing about finitude, and how life is fleeting, extraordinary and improbable, and yet unique mortals are trammelled by external edicts, forced to spend their time earning minimal wages, measuring passport photographs with a ruler. In her memory-scapes and dreamworlds, Smith reveals the buried longings of her characters; their agony, their hopeful eagerness, their fear of death. [‚Ä¶] Autumn is a beautiful, poignant symphony of memories, dreams and transient realities; the 'endless sad fragility' of mortal lives.\\" The Scotsman's Stuart Kelly judged that, \\"In a way, AL Kennedy‚Äôs Serious Sweet has a better claim to be the first post-Brexit novel, despite being published before the vote, in that it diagnoses with tender anger and furious empathy the state leading up to the referendum. Kennedy channels a kind of regretful, anxious bruxism; Smith presents a bewildered, open-jawed aghast.\\" He went on to find \\"echoes of [Smith's] previous work: some of the most beautiful parts of the novel are Daniel‚Äôs fitful dreams on the edge of death, which are reminiscent of the Sara Wilby sections of Hotel World; Elisabeth is a cynical naif or na√Øve cynic like Amber in The Accidental, whose outspokenness reveals the absurdity and hypocrisy of the world (the sections where she deals with the bureaucracy of getting a new passport are amongst the funniest things Smith has written)\\", before adding: \\"This is not to in any way suggest self- plagiarism: Smith is original even when revisiting tropes she has used beforehand.\\" Kelly concluded, \\"Smith straddles the elegiac and the celebratory throughout this glorious novel. It manages to be both pertinent and perpetual [‚Ä¶] Roll on Winter.\\" In The Independent, Lucy Scholes decided that, \\"Already acknowledged as one of the most inventive novelists writing in Britain today, with her new novel, Autumn, Ali Smith also proves herself to be one of the country‚Äôs foremost chroniclers, her finger firmly on the social and political pulse.\\" In the Financial Times, Alex Preston wrote: \\"The first of a quartet of season-themed novels, it begins with the Brexit vote and spools forwards in time (and backwards, and sideways, as is Smith's wont) towards November 2016. I looked up at one point when I was reading, and realised that the time of the novel had just overtaken real-world time. It‚Äôs a brilliant and unsettling conceit, leaving you marvelling that writing this good could have come so fast.\\" He acknowledged that, \\"Autumn is a novel of ideas, and plot isn‚Äôt the reason we keep turning the pages. What grips the reader is the way that Smith draws us deeper into Elisabeth‚Äôs world [‚Ä¶] and the way the amiable, big- hearted Daniel triangulates and illuminates these lives.\\" Preston concluded by saying, \\"I can think of few writers ‚Äî Virginia Woolf is one, James Salter another ‚Äî so able to propel a narrative through voice alone. Smith‚Äôs use of free indirect discourse, the close-third-person style that puts the reader at once within and without her characters, means that Autumn, for all its braininess, is never difficult. [‚Ä¶] This is a novel that works by accretion, appearing light and playful, surface-dwelling, while all the time enacting profound changes on the reader‚Äôs heart. In a country apparently divided against itself, a writer such as Smith, who makes you feel known, who seems to speak to your own private weirdnesses, is more valuable than a whole parliament of politicians.\\" The book was named by The New York Times as one of the 10 Best Books of 2017. In 2019, the novel was ranked 8th on The Guardian's list of the 100 best books of the 21st century.

Released on January 9, 2015, it serves as the pre- release single of the former's debut solo studio album One Fine Day (2015). While filming the television series The Three Musketeers (2014), Jung was inspired by YDG's affection towards his family on set to compose the song. Upon release of Jung's album, the two performed \\"Mileage\\" on music programs and talk shows. The song debuted and peaked at number 57 on South Korea's national Gaon Digital Chart, selling over 78,000 digital downloads since its release. Background and composition In May 2014, Jung was in talks to take part in TVN's television series The Three Musketeers. He was officially cast the following month and would star alongside actors Lee Jin-wook and Yang Dong-geun. As recording for the series took place, Yang conveyed endearment to his family on set; Jung took this as inspiration to write the melody for \\"Mileage\\". After listening to the track, Yang immediately wrote his rap. He stated that \\"it formed connections in my head right away\\", further expressing that Jung was a \\"musician who has overcome genres\\". \\"Mileage\\" was written and composed by Jung; YDG contributed the lyrics of his rap. The song is composed in the key of E major using common time with a tempo of 90 beats per minute. Release and promotion On January 6, 2015, FNC Entertainment's homepage was redesigned into a teaser website for One Fine Day. The following day, it was revealed that Jung had collaborated with YDG on the track \\"Mileage\\". It serves as a pre-release single to the album. One day prior to its release, a music video teaser for \\"Mileage\\" was revealed; the full version was uploaded on January 9. It features the duo dressed in hip hop apparel with \\"cartoon-esque\\" imagery, along with \\"comical, straight-faced acting\\". Jung performed \\"Mileage\\" alongside YDG on Seoul Broadcasting System's (SBS) music show Inkigayo, as well as on the January 30 broadcast of KBS2's talk show You Hee-yeol's Sketchbook. Jung also performed the song the January 15, 2016 broadcast in midst of promoting \\"Empathy\\" with Sunwoo Jung-a; the episode was ranked among the top seven performances on the show's history by online music store Melon. Critical reception Writing for Ize magazine, music critic Kim Yeong-dae noted how \\"Mileage\\" was able to \\"elegantly advance the recurring thematic progression by controlling the tension through length of notes while minimizing harmonic shifts\\", which he claimed \\"attests to the fact that [Jung's] songwriting capability has stepped up to a standard\\". An Sang-wook and Yeolshimhi of Y magazine rated the song two out of three stars. Both reviewers noted similarities to Jason Mraz's music, with An particularly highlighting the \\"groovy\\" and \\"simple\\" instrumentation, which made him feel that it could \\"pass\\" as a CNBLUE track. An spoke positively of YDG's rapping, which \\"complements nicely, functioning to focus the tone of the track\\". He felt that \\"Mileage\\" as a pre-release single was \\"not a bad choice\\", but expressed that the song \\"sticks out\\" on One Fine Day. Yeolshimhi described the song as \\"something familiar\\" which leaves the listener \\"wanting more of memorable parts or melodies\\". He stated that, as a composer, Jung was \\"less inclined to provide entertainment or leave an 'impression'\\".

Members of the tribe, known as \\"globidensins\\" or \\"globidensine mosasaurs\\", have been recovered from North America, Europe, Africa and Asia. The tribe contains the genera Globidens (the best studied genus by far), Carinodens and Igdamanosaurus.Schulp, Anne S., et al. \\"New mosasaur material from the Maastrichtian of Angola, with notes on the phylogeny, distribution and palaeoecology of the genus Prognathodon.\\" On Maastricht Mosasaurs.

(Globidens schurmanni) to successfully reclaim the niche of the durophagous lifestyle. This niche had been unoccupied for most of the Mesozoic ever since the extinction of the placodonts and the durophagous ichthyosaur Grippia. The rarity of the Globidensini in the fossil record remains a mystery, perhaps it is due to habitat preference (deep water), some other form of taphonomic bias or due to the durophagous lifestyle not allowing the establishment of large populations in the first place. The robust and globular teeth have on occasion been compared to the genera Prognathodon and Plesiotylosaurus, both of which sometimes are included within the tribe. Said genera are probably not as closely connected to Globidens as such an inclusion would suggest.Madzia, D., Cau, A. (2017). Inferring \\"weak spots\\" in phylogenetic trees: application to mosasauroid nomenclature. PeerJ 5:e3782 The etymology of the tribe derives from the genus Globidens (Latin Globus = \\"globe\\" + Latin dens = \\"teeth\\").  Description  Reconstructed skull of Globidens dakotensis, showing the distinctive globular teeth. Overall, globidensins were medium-sized mosasaurs, with Globidens itself reaching about 6 meters in length. The teeth of Globidens, Carinodens and Igdamanosaurus differ from those of all other mosasaurs in being very robust and globular. Most mosasaur genera have sharp teeth adapted to grab soft and slippery prey like fish and cephalopods. Though some clearly were capable of crushing through the shells of armored prey, none were as specialized as Globidens and its kin, which combined robust and powerful skulls with semispherical teeth capable of crushing through the shells of animals like ammonites, bivalves and small turtles. Russell (1967) did not offer a proper diagnosis for the tribe when he named it, due to how poorly known the osteology of Globidens was at the time, but nevertheless erected a new tribe due to the clearly distinct features separating Globidens from the rest of the Mosasaurinae and considered Globidens to be a derived descendant of Clidastes. A more recently suggested definition is a branch-based definition diagnosing the Globidensini as the most inclusive clade containing Globidens dakotensis but not Mosasaurus hoffmannii.  Jaw mechanics  Both the genus Globidens and Prognathodon (sometimes classified as a globidensin, though most often not) have adaptations to a powerful jaw musculature. The ratio between the length of the supratemporal fenestra and the total length of the skull has previously been used as an improvised measurement for mosasaur bite force, and is quite high in these genera (0.27 in Globidens dakotensis and 0.22 in Prognathodon overtoni and P. saturator) compared to other mosasaurs like Mosasaurus hoffmannii (with a ratio of 0.19).

In total, at least 64 to at least 88 people were killed and at least 94 were wounded, with at least three attackers also being killed. Other attacks may have taken place.  Bombings  First bombing The first attack was a twin suicide bombing in front of the National Assembly of Afghanistan in the capital Kabul. The Taliban claimed responsibility for this attack that killed at least 46 people, mostly parliament workers, and wounded over 70, while they claimed that 70 were killed. The target was a National Directorate of Security minibus. There were two bombers, one on foot and one in a car. Second bombing The second attack occurred at Governor Humayun Azizi's guesthouse in Kandahar, when the United Arab Emirates ambassador Juma Al Kaabi and his fellow diplomats were being hosted for dinner. The UAE ambassador and diplomats were on a visit to Kandahar to lay the foundation stone for an orphanage to be built and sponsored by the UAE government.https://m.khaleejtimes.com/nation-in-mourning- as-5-uae-diplomats-killed-in-kandahar-attack A hidden bomb was detonated during the meeting, killing at least 11 people and wounding at least 18.

The UAE Ambassador to Afghanistan, Juma Al Kaabi, was also injured during the attack, and died of his injuries more than a month later, on February 15. Abdul Ali Shamsi, Kandahar's deputy governor, was also among those killed. Although suspected, the Taliban did not claim responsibility for the bombing and instead blamed it on \\"internal local rivalry\\". Much of the bombing was orchestrated by a longtime cook named Sayeed Mahboob Agha. Agha had previously worked as a cook for members of the Taliban, and was known to have ongoing contact with the Taliban. Agha moved from Farah province to Kandahar to work at the Kandahar governor's guesthouse, on the recommendation of Taliban acquaintances. He was later offered $30,000 and a residence in Pakistan in exchange for smuggling a bomb into the guesthouse. Third bombing A third bombing occurred in Lashkargah, where at least seven to 16 civilians were killed and six to nine were injured, not including the deceased suicide bomber. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack that targeted a tribal elder. The National Assembly of Afghanistan.  Victims  The bombings killed numerous civilians, diplomats, and guards. In total, at least 64 to at least 88 people were killed and at least 94 were wounded. Some of the named victims include: * Five UAE diplomats, killed.

A convict receiving a caning sentence in Banda Aceh in 2014. Caning is one of the controversial provisions of Islamic criminal law in Aceh. The province of Aceh in Indonesia enforces some provisions of Islamic criminal law, the sole Indonesian province to do so. In Aceh, Islamic criminal law is called jinayat (an Arabic loanword). The laws that implement it are called Qanun Jinayat or Hukum Jinayat, roughly meaning \\"Islamic criminal code\\". Although the largely-secular laws of Indonesia apply in Aceh, the provincial government passed additional regulations, some derived from Islamic criminal law, after Indonesia authorized its provinces to enact regional regulations (perda) and granted Aceh special autonomy to implement Islamic law. Offences under the provisions include alcohol consumption, production and distribution, gambling, adultery, rape, sexual harassment, certain intimacies outside marriage, and certain homosexual acts. Punishments include caning, fines, and imprisonment. There is no provision for stoning; an attempt to introduce it in 2009 was vetoed by Governor Irwandi Yusuf. In 2016 Aceh processed 324 first instance court cases under Islamic criminal law, and carried out at least 100 caning sentences. Supporters of Islamic criminal law defend its legality under the special autonomy granted to Aceh, saying that it is covered by the freedom of religion of the people of Aceh. Critics, including Amnesty International, object to the use of caning as a punishment, as well as the criminalization of consensual sex outside marriage.  Background   Special autonomy of Aceh  Soldiers of the now-defunct Free Aceh Movement (date unknown, photo published in 1999). The insurgency in Aceh led to a peace treaty and special autonomy in Aceh. Aceh is the westernmost province of Indonesia, with a population of 4.49million according to the 2010 census (roughly 1.8% of Indonesia's total population).Hasil Sensus Penduduk 2010, Badan Pusat Statistik It differs from other regions of Indonesia due to its distinct political, religious, and ethnic identity, formed during the time of the indigenous pre-colonial states such as the Aceh Sultanate. Muslims in Aceh are generally more religious than those in other parts of Indonesia, and are proud of their Islamic heritage, earning the province the nickname of \\"Verandah of Mecca\\" (). More than 98% of Aceh's population identify as Muslim. As part of the post-Suharto reforms, Indonesia granted more power to local governments. This decentralization of power was largely governed by two laws passed in 1999 and 2004. These laws authorized the local governments and legislatures to pass regional regulations (peraturan daerah or perda) that carry the force of law, as long as they do not conflict with laws or regulations that are higher in the hierarchy of laws. Aceh's regional regulations are known as qanun (from an Arabic word meaning \\"law\\" or \\"rules\\") instead of perda. In addition to this, Aceh was given special autonomy, partly in response to the 19762005 insurgency in the province. Indonesian Law No.18 of 2001 on Special Autonomy in Aceh granted broader powers to the province, including the authority to formally implement Islamic law. Law No.11 of 2006 on the Administration of Aceh explicitly made implementation of Islamic law the legal duty of the government of Aceh.  Status of Islamic law in Indonesia  At the national level, there are three systems of law in operation in Indonesia: civil law, commercial law, and criminal law. Outside Aceh, the influence of Islamic law is limited to civil law in the areas of marriage, inheritance, and religious endowments (), and to commercial law in certain areas of Islamic banking and finance. Other sources of civil and commercial law include European codes and customary tradition (). The criminal code (, KUHP, the \\"Criminal Law Code\\") is largely based on the Netherlands Indies Criminal Code imposed by the Netherlands, which ruled Indonesia before 1945, with certain amendments promulgated by the Republic of Indonesia after independence. Aceh is the only province of Indonesia that enforces Islamic law in criminal matters.  Legal status  Provisions of Islamic law specific to Aceh are promulgated through qanuns, which have the legal status of perda (regional regulation). Their legal basis includes Indonesian laws authorizing perda, as well Law No.11 of 2006, which mandated Islamic law in Aceh. A qanun requires approval from both the parliament of Aceh (, DPRA) and the governor to become law. While the largely secular Indonesian national law still applies in Aceh, the qanuns cover offences not defined in the national law, and in some cases define a different punishment. The qanuns are subordinate to the Indonesian constitution and national laws, and are subject to judicial review in the Supreme Court or the Constitutional Court. This legal structure means that not all provisions of Islamic law apply in Aceh, but only the specific elements of it which have been legislated. It also means that legislation is carried out by the elected parliament and governor, not the ulema (Islamic scholars).  Legislative history  Governor Irwandi Yusuf (in office 2007‚Äì2012) vetoed a 2009 qanun which would have introduced stoning. Institution of Islamic criminal law in Aceh began with Qanun No.11 of 2002, which was largely symbolic. In 2003 further laws were passed: Qanuns No.12, which dealt with the consumption of alcohol, No.13, on gambling, and No.14, on khalwat (being alone with someone of the opposite sex who is not a spouse or a relative). In 2009 the parliament of Aceh approved a new qanun that expanded the implementation of Islamic criminal law, but the governor at the time, Irwandi Yusuf, refused to sign the qanun into law, openly declaring his opposition to the provision of stoning (rajm) in the Qanun. The law required approval from both the legislature and the governor, so it did not go into effect. On 27September 2014 the parliament of Aceh passed Qanun No.6, which revised the rejected 2009 qanun and removed the provision of stoning. Governor Zaini Abdullah signed it into law on 23October 2014, and it went into effect one year later on 23October 2015, as stipulated by the qanun. Compared to the 2003 qanuns that it replaced, Qanun No.6 increased the number of offences punishable under Islamic law as well as the severity of punishment. Under the 2003 laws, the maximum number of caning strokes was set at 40, and in practice it rarely exceeded 12, but the 2014 law set the minimum number of strokes at 10 and the maximum at 150.  Possible expansion  In March 2018, Aceh's sharia and human rights bureau started conducting research and consulting public opinion for the introduction of capital punishment, specifically beheading, as punishment for severe crimes such as murder.  Provisions  Qanun Aceh No. 6 of 2014 (known as the Qanun Jinayat) is the latest revision of Islamic criminal law implementation in Aceh. It criminalizes the consumption and production of liquor (called khamar in the law), gambling (maisir), being alone with someone of the opposite sex who is not a spouse or a relative (khalwat), committing intimacy outside marriage (ikhtilath), adultery (zina), sexual abuse (pelecehan seksual), rape (pemerkosaan), falsely accusing someone of adultery (qadzaf), sodomy between males (liwath), and lesbian acts (musahaqah)Qanun Aceh No. 6 of 2014, Arts 1 and 3 The penalty for violation of these laws includes caning, fines, and imprisonment. The severity of the sentence varies. Khalwat offences have the lightest sentence, and may include caning (maximum 10 strokes), 10 months' imprisonment, or a fine of 100 gold grams.Qanun Aceh No. 6 of 2014, Art 23 The heaviest sentence is imposed on perpetrators of child rape; the sentence may be caning (150200 strokes), imprisonment (150200 months), or a fine (1,5002,000 gold grams).Qanun Aceh No. 6 of 2014, Art 50 Judges of individual cases have the discretion of imposing caning, imprisonment, or a fine. According to Amnesty International, there were 108 cases of caning carried out under the Qanun in 2015, and 100 in 2016 up to October. The law is applicable to all offences committed by Muslims or legal entities in Aceh. It also applies to offences committed by non-Muslims if the offences are not regulated in the Indonesian Criminal Code, or if committed together with a Muslim and the non-Muslim voluntarily chooses Islamic law.Qanun Aceh No. 6 of 2014, Art 5 In April 2016 a Christian woman was caned 28 times for selling alcoholthe first non-Muslim to receive caning under the law. The Aceh Sharia courts (Mahkamah Syar'iyah Aceh), which hear both civil and criminal cases involving Islamic law Major institutions relevant to the implementation of Islamic criminal law in Aceh include the ulama council (, MPU), the Wilayatul Hisbah (WH, sometimes referred to in English as the \\"Sharia police\\"), and the sharia courts (). The ulema council is composed of both the ulama and \\"Muslim intellectuals\\", and on paper is expected to be involved in drafting legislation together with the government. However, it has not been able to exercise these powers, and in reality legislation is done by the Parliament of Aceh and the governor's office. The Wilayatul Hisbah has the authority to reprimand and give advice to those caught violating the Islamic law. It does not have the authority to formally charge or detain suspects, and thus must work together with the regular police and prosecutors in order to enforce the law. The sharia courts hear and rule on both civil cases under Islamic law (such as divorce and inheritance) and criminal law under the qanuns. However, civil cases continue to be the vast majority of cases heard by the court. In 2016 the courts received 10,888 first instance civil cases and 131 appeals, compared to 324 first instance criminal cases and 15 appeals. The sharia courts are part of the broader Indonesian legal system. Their decisions can be appealed to the Supreme Court, and their judges (including the chief judge) are appointed by the Supreme Court.  Judicial review  A judicial review before the Indonesian Supreme Court was brought against the 2014 Qanun by the Institute for Criminal Justice Reform in 2015. The petitioner argued that the Qanun was not in line with superior laws, namely the national Criminal Code, as the code did not include caning in its exhaustive list of allowed punishments; the 1999 Human Rights Law and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, since caning is considered to be a form of torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment under these instruments; and also the Criminal Procedure Code for the reason that the code requires police to provide evidence for crimes, not the victims, and oath before God is not regarded as a valid form of evidence. Furthermore, the petitioner asserted that the Qanun was contrary to \\"hierarchy of laws\\" clause under Article 7(1) of the Law-making Law. It further argued that the Qanun violated Article 6(1)(i) of the 2011 Law-making Law, as the Qanun was deemed to be a duplicate of national laws and thus was compromising legal order and certainty. However, because at the time of the appeal the Indonesian Constitutional Court was reviewing a challenge against the said Article 7(1), the Court dismissed the appeal by invoking Article 55 of the Constitutional Court Law. This decision was criticized by expert of Indonesian law Simon Butt, as the Supreme Court could have proceeded with the case by considering the claim that the Qanun is contrary to other higher-level laws.  Reactions  Amnesty International said that they are \\"seriously concerned\\" about the implementation of the law and called for the repeal of some of its provisions. It said that caning can amount to torture and contravenes the Constitution of Indonesia and international human rights law, and can cause long-term physical and mental injuries. Additionally, it objected to the criminalization of consensual sexual relationships outside marriage, on the grounds that they violate the right to privacy. Indonesian women's rights organization Solidaritas Perempuan said that the provisions are biased against women, and that the high standard of proof required for rape convictions means that many rapists are acquitted. Legal scholar Hamdani of Aceh's Malikussaleh University said that the people of Aceh have the right to enact Islamic law as freedom of religion and defended its legality based on Indonesian laws granting Aceh authority to enact Islamic law. Deputy head of the Aceh Islamic Sharia Agency Munawar Jalil rejected criticism that provisions of the law violated human rights or existing laws in Indonesia and Aceh, and invited critics to file a judicial review if they believe otherwise.

Kyle, who was a former Navy SEAL, and his friend Littlefield were walking down range to set up targets when Eddie Ray Routh opened fire and hit both of them. Routh was a 25-year-old Marine who had experienced posttraumatic stress disorder. The case attracted national attention due to Kyle's fame as author of a bestselling biography, American Sniper, published in 2012.  Murders  Chris Kyle had begun working with veterans after leaving the military. Routh's mother, who worked at the school that Kyle's children attended, had heard of his work and asked him to help her son. He agreed to take Routh to a shooting range, which Kyle believed had therapeutic value. On February 2, 2013, Kyle and his friend, Chad Littlefield, 35, were shot and killed by Eddie Ray Routh at the Rough Creek Ranch-Lodge-Resort shooting range in Erath County, Texas. Both Kyle and Littlefield were armed with .45-caliber M1911-style pistols when they were killed, but neither gun had been unholstered or fired, and the safety catches were still on. Kyle was killed with a .45-caliber pistol, while Littlefield was shot with a 9mm SIG Sauer P226 Mk.25 Mod 0 pistol. Both guns belonged to Kyle. Routh was a 25-year-old U.S. Marine Corps veteran from Lancaster, Texas. Kyle and Littlefield had reportedly taken Routh to the gun range in an effort to help him with his post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Routh had been in and out of mental hospitals for at least two years and had been diagnosed with schizophrenia. His family also said he suffered from PTSD from his time in the military. On the way to the shooting range, Kyle texted Littlefield, \\"This dude is straight up nuts.\\" Littlefield responded, \\"Watch my six,\\" military slang meaning \\"watch my back.\\" Four months later, while he was in his jail cell, Routh shared with former Erath County Sheriff's Deputy Gene Cole: \\"I was just riding in the back seat of the truck, and nobody would talk to me. They were just taking me to the range, so I shot them. I feel bad about it, but they wouldn't talk to me. I'm sure they've forgiven me.\\" After the killings, Routh went to his sister's house in Midlothian and told her what he had done. His sister, Laura Blevins, called 9-1-1 and told the emergency operator: \\"They went out to a shooting range ... Like, he's all crazy. He's ... psychotic.\\" Local police captured Routh after a short freeway chase, which ended when Routh, who fled the scene in Kyle's Ford F-350 truck, crashed into a police cruiser in Lancaster.  Perpetrator  Eddie Ray Routh was born on September 30, 1987, in Lancaster, Texas, to Raymond and Jodi Routh. He has an older sister, Laura Blevins. He had wanted to join the Marine Corps since he was thirteen years old, and did so after high school. He was deployed to a base near Baghdad in September 2007, where he worked for six months as a prison guard and repaired weapons. In January 2010, he was sent on a humanitarian mission to Haiti. He was honorably discharged from the Marine Corps in July 2011 after serving for seven years. In late July 2011, Routh was diagnosed by clinicians at Veterans hospital as having post-traumatic stress disorder and was prescribed antipsychotics and antidepressants. He was experiencing auditory hallucinations and paranoia and had threatened suicide. VA clinicians believed Routh's psychotic symptoms were caused by alcohol abuse and offered inpatient treatment. He declined and stopped taking his medication.  Victims  * Chris Kyle (April 8, 1974 February 2, 2013), age 38 * Chad Littlefield (February 11, 1977 February 2, 2013), age 35  Trial  Routh was arraigned February 2, 2013, on two counts of capital murder, and was taken to the Erath County Jail for holding under a $3 million bond. His trial was set to begin May 5, 2014, but was delayed to allow more time to comply with DNA testing requirements. The trial began on February 11, 2015. Routh's attorneys argued that he was insane at the time of the murders. Forensic psychologist Randall Price, a witness for the prosecution, suspected Routh was faking schizophrenia. He said that Routh actually had paranoid personality disorder exacerbated by drug use. He also testified that Routh's psychotic symptoms could be attributed to drug and alcohol abuse. Another expert, Dr. Michael Arambula, testified he did not believe Routh was schizophrenic, and was not insane at the time of the murders because he was intoxicated. On February 24, 2015, Routh was found guilty of murdering Kyle and Littlefield. The jury returned the verdict after less than three hours of deliberations. Since prosecutors decided beforehand not to seek the death penalty, the trial judge, Jason Cashon, immediately sentenced Routh to life in prison with no possibility of parole. Routh is imprisoned at the Texas Department of Criminal Justice Powledge Unit near Palestine, Texas.  Funerals  A memorial service was held for Kyle at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, on February 11, 2013. He was buried on February 12, 2013, at the Texas State Cemetery in Austin, after the funeral cortege journeyed from Midlothian to Austin, more than . Hundreds of people, many waving American flags, lined Interstate 35 to view the procession and pay their final respects to Kyle.

Historically, dislike or hatred toward the Netherlands, the Dutch people and their culture has arisen from the colonization undertaken by the Netherlands, and from the roles it has played in European wars. This sentiment is reflected in various expressions that have entered the English language, one of which is the pejorative Kaaskop. Dutch colonies Southeast Asia Most of present-day Indonesia was a Dutch colony - the Dutch East Indies - from 1800 until the Japanese invasion during World War II. After the defeat of the Japanese, when the Dutch attempted to reassert control, anti- Dutch feeling developed among the native population, encompassing anything associated with the Dutch. The outcome was the Indonesian National Revolution, culminating in 1949 in the independence of Indonesia. South Africa In South Africa, following the Boer War (1899-1902) between the British government and settlers of Dutch descent, anti-Dutch sentiments were present within the English-speaking population and were identified with the Unionist Party. South America and the Caribbean A growing nationalist movement gave rise to anti-Dutch sentiment during the 1950s in the then colony of Surinam. Suriname became self-governing in 1954 and fully independent in 1975. European wars Anglo-Dutch Wars From the Anglo-Dutch Wars of the 17th to 19th centuries date expressions conveying varying degrees of hostility or mockery towards the Dutch, such as \\"Dutch courage\\", \\"Dutch uncle\\", \\"Going Dutch\\", \\"Dutch treat\\", \\"Double Dutch\\" and \\"I'm a Dutchman\\". Anti-Dutch feeling grew up in England during the three wars against the Dutch Republic between 1652 and 1674, and continued during and after the reign of William of Orange.Jonathan Israel, \\"England, the Dutch, and the Struggle for Mastery of World Trade in the Age of the Glorious Revolution (1682-1702)\\", in First World War The neutrality maintained by the Netherlands during the First World War evoked unfavourable comment in Britain, epitomised by a remark in Punch: Second World War During World War II, German occupiers in Belgium were promoting the use of Dutch language in communities of French-speakers, which lead to strong Dutchphobia among those people.

The group was formed during World War II, in 1942, by four servicemen serving in the American Panama Canal Zone ‚Äì Bob Sprague (first tenor), Harry Gedicke (second tenor), Harry Shuman (baritone), and arranger and lead singer George Becker. Under the name The Velvetones they toured bases in Panama and appeared in a weekly program on Armed Forces Radio Network. After the end of the war and their discharge, the group relocated to Detroit and added a female lead singer, the lively and charismatic Gilda Maiken. The group appeared on national radio, and Woody Herman engaged them to appear with his band. Upon joining Herman they changed their name to the Blue Moods. They recorded \\"Stars Fell on Alabama\\" and toured with Herman, but Herman's band broke up in 1947, after which they recorded two songs with Bing Crosby, who changed their name to The Skylarks. In 1948 they joined and recorded with Jimmy Dorsey's orchestra, but Dorsey's band soon broke up, after which Harry James hired them. In 1949 The Skylarks recorded with Russ Morgan and had number one hits with \\"Cruisin' Down the River\\" and \\"Forever and Ever\\". By this time The Skylarks had added a second female singer and consisted of original member George Becker, early member Gilda Maiken, and Chick Gale, Joe Pryor, and Gladys Vesely. By the 1950s lineup was Becker, Maiken, Joe Hamilton, Earl Brown, and female singer, Jackie Gershwin (later replaced by Carol Lombard; Donna Manners and Peggy Clark also later spent some time in the group). They sang backup for artists including Dinah Shore, Eddie Fisher, Danny Kaye, Jerry Lewis, Betty Hutton, Dean Martin, and Frank Sinatra. On their own they had a number 28 hit in 1953 with \\"I Had the Craziest Dream\\" from the film Springtime in the Rockies (1942) starring Betty Grable. The Skylarks toured with Dinah Shore and Martin and Lewis and appeared on TV variety shows in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s (The Danny Kaye Show, The Dinah Shore Show (where they were regular performers, 1956-1957), The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show, The Carol Burnett Show, The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour). Their 1957 album Ridin' On The Moon was described by musicologist Todd Decker as \\"a forgotten masterpiece of jazz arranging and singing\\"; Decker described \\"Ol' Man River\\", released from the album as a single, as \\"a kind of cubist assemblage of familiar elements made delightfully strange...

The family may have originated as the Lubici recorded near Scutari in 1417, when the Lubici brothers are mentioned in Podgora. According to an Italian source, the Gliubizza hailed from Budva. Marco Gliubizza (fl. 1555), ser, was a grain merchant in Ulcinj. Andrea Giubizza was the Roman Catholic bishop of Ulcinj from 1558 until his death in 1565. Alessandro Giubizza (fl. 1575‚Äì76) from Ulcinj had been employed at the court of Koca Sinan Pasha in Istanbul, then moved to Kotor where he is recorded in 1576. He gave information to the Venetian government in January 1576. Alessandro had been taken captive after the Ottoman capture of Ulcinj, but managed to have himself ransomed. His sister and nephew were released by Sinan Pasha, after which Alessandro stayed in Istanbul and became close with Mehmed Bey, Sinan Pasha's nephew. Alessandro and these came to an agreement that he would be informed of events against Venetian interest in the Kotor and border areas, in return he would buy luxury goods for Mehmed Bey in Venice. Alessandro called Sinan Pasha an Albanian and 'the first cousin of my mother'. Noel Malcolm believes that the family had a close family tie with Sinan Pasha, possibly through the Bruti family.

He was the founder and Managing Director of the Perth-based telecommunications provider iinet starting the business in his parents' garage. He is a pioneer of dial up access back in 1993 before the Internet became mainstream. Over the years he has been an advocate for Internet consumer rights as well participating in metadata debate. He was recently appointed as a non executive director of the NBNco in 2016.  Early life  Malone was born in County Clare, Ireland and migrated to Australia in 1978 with his parents and two brothers.  Education  Malone has a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Post Graduate Diploma in Education from The University of Western Australia.  Business career  Michael Malone and Michael O'Reilly founded iiNet in 1993, starting the business in a suburban garage in Perth as iiNet Technologies Pty Ltd. It began as one of the first Australian ISPs to offer TCP/IP Internet access, as opposed to the store-and- forward techniques (such as MHSnet) that were then in use at other ISPs. It claims it was the first ISP to offer PPP access in Australia, and to be the first to base operations on the then new Linux operating system. The company outgrew its suburban home in 1995 and moved to CBD office accommodation yet its early growth during the Internet boom was hampered by the ability of Telstra (not releasing Bigpond as an ISP until 1997) to cope with the demand of needed telephone lines, and by the sheer competitive pressure in the Perth market, which had a comparative oversupply of low-cost providers. In 1996, iiNet successfully expanded into the Adelaide market under the name light.iinet.net.au (named after Colonel Light), in partnership with locals John Lindsay and Leigh Hart. During his executive tenure at iiNet, Malone aggressively grew iiNet by acquiring other leading ISPs all over Australia. He grew the company to become the second largest ISP in Australia. He was also a passionate advocate for Internet consumer rights in regards to privacy as well contributing to the metadata debate. Malone was a lead witness and spokesperson in the Roadshow Films Pty Ltd v iiNet Ltd copyright case that was successful in the High Court of Australia. Malone stepped aside as Managing Director in early 2014 after taking a three-week holiday in Argentina which was supposed to be a three-month to six month sabbatical. In 2015, iiNet was acquired by TPG Telecom. Malone has served on the board of Seven West Media, SpeedCast, Superloop and Dreamscape Limited. He is the chairman of a Perth- based information security company Diamond Cyber. He joined the board of nbnco in 2016.

In 1929 they moved to the suburb of Belmont, and in 1942 they purchased the house Threeways in Little Compton, Rhode Island, where both she and her husband died. In 1966 twenty of her paintings were exhibited in a one-woman show celebrating the 50th anniversary of the graduation of Wheaton's class of 1916. Luce was described by critic Henry McBride as \\"the American Breughel\\", and her early style is reminiscent of that of Charles Burchfield; later paintings take a Precisionist approach. The Whitney Museum of American Art owns examples of her work, as does the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which reproduced Winter in the Suburbs as a Christmas card. Her painting Pennsylvania Coal Country of 1927, owned by the Carnegie Museum of Art, was included in the inaugural exhibition of the National Museum of Women in the Arts, American Women Artists 1830‚Äì1930, in 1987. Luce's papers are held by Syracuse University. An oral history interview, recorded in 1981, is currently held by the Archives of American Art.

Frederiksgade is a major thoroughfare for pedestrians and cyclists and it connects Immervad to ARoS Aarhus Art Museum and the City Hall and Concert Hall parks. The street is fairly narrow and the architecture is primarily late 19th century to early 20th century.  History  In medieval times, a street extended southwards from Vadestedet (The Ford) at Immervad across a steep hill south of the Aarhus river. In the Middle Age, a bridge was constructed at the ford and the street became known as Brobjerg ((lit. Bridge-hill)). The original housing along Brobjerg was constructed through the 1400s. In 1482, a sizeable Carmelite convent was built near the top of the hill, but following the Reformation in Denmark the convent fell on hard times and in 1541 it was demolished and the materials used for construction elsewhere. Brobjerg was mostly settled by the 1600s, but during the occupation by Sweden during the Torstenson War, many buildings were torn down to get constructionmaterials for the defensive Skansepal√¶et. In 1824, Brobjerg was renamed Frederiksgade after the Danish king Frederik VI (1768-1839) who was involved in the restoration of the city gate Brobjerg Port. The king decided upon the design of the new city gate and in honor of his visit the gate was renamed Frederiksport and the street was named Frederiksgade. Brobjerg had become an important thoroughfare in the city, with many large merchanthouses built here over the years. However, in the 1800s it had fell into disrepair and it was decided to renovate it. The old wooden bridge over the river was replaced by one of granite and by 1854 the project was completed. Today, Frederiksgade has status of high-street with a commercial feel and many shops, boutiques, restaurants and bars. It is a major thoroughfare; the southern part is pedestrianized and the northern part is a cycle-street with priority for cyclists.  Notable buildings  The most notable building on Frederiksgade is the listed building Herskind's House (K√∏bmand Herskind's G√•rd). The house was built in approximately 1850 and was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places by the Danish Heritage Agency on 2 October 1970. The building consists of the main building and two other wings; a half-timbered back building from 1726 and another smaller building facing the street. The buildings have been owned by a series of merchants who expanded the property at different times. In 1865 a connection was constructed between the main house and the south-wing and in 1858 a low north-wing was built.

Thus, at the end of hostilities, it seemed necessary to pay tribute to the courage of these people by rewarding them with several medals such as the Medal for victims of the invasion, the Medal of French Fidelity and the Medal for civilian prisoners, deportees and hostages of the 1914-1918 Great War. It was on the proposal of the Minister for the Liberated Regions that the Medal for victims of the invasion () was created on 30 June 1921 in three classes (bronze, silver and silver gilt). The Medal of the Victims of the Invasion thanked and distinguished the war hostages, and persons deported outside of France, imprisoned by the enemy or condemned to forced labour. Among the civilian victims of the war who were awarded the medal under the original conditions, two categories of persons were recognized to have the right to special recognition by the country. On the one hand, political prisoners condemned by the German authorities to severe punishment for their attachment to France and, on the other hand, hostages of war who for months, sometimes years, remained in retaliation camps in Poland and Lithuania, exposed to the worst suffering and the most cruel privations. It is to point out this double category of citizens to the respectful attention of their compatriots, that two clasps were authorized for wear on the medal ribbon \\"POLITICAL PRISONERS\\" and \\"WAR HOSTAGES\\" Award statute The Medal for victims of the invasion was awarded in three classes, the 1st class in silver gilt, 2nd class in silver and 3rd class in bronze. It was awarded to French citizens from the occupied regions who served as war hostages, were deported or used as forced labourers. A further decree recognized victims of brutality and serious abuse. All recipients also receive a scroll attesting to the presentation of the medal. Award description The Medal for victims of the invasion is a 30 mm in diameter circular medal struck in bronze, silvered bronze, silver or gilt silver. Its obverse, by engraver Pierre Dautel, bears the relief image of the right profile of a woman wearing a scarf, her hands bound in front of her, looking skywards. The reverse bears the relief inscription on six lines \\"AUX\\" \\"VICTIMES\\" \\"DE\\" \\"L‚ÄôINVASION\\" \\"LA FRANCE\\" \\"RECONNAISSANTE\\" (TO THE VICTIMS OF THE INVASION A GRATEFUL FRANCE) surrounded by a laurel wreath along the entire outer circumference except for the bottom where the years \\"1914-1918\\" can be found. The rectangular suspension loop, affixed atop the medal, bore the relief image of chains. The medal hangs from a 36 mm wide silk moir√© navy blue ribbon with a 2 mm wide black central stripe and two 5 mm wide red stripes located 5 mm from the outer edges. The ribbon of the medal 1st class bears a rosette in the colours of the ribbon.

She is Political Editor-at-Large for The Daily Telegraph and host of the Sky News program \\"Sharri\\" which airs on Sunday evenings. Early life Markson was born and raised in Sydney. Her father is celebrity promoter, Max Markson. She worked for The Sunday Telegraph, where she was twice named News Limited's Young Journalist of the Year. Career In 2012 Markson won her first Walkley Award for television news reporting for a Cabinet Leak that revealed the NSW Government banned the sale of unleaded petrol without ethanol, to the benefit of the monopoly company, Manildra, against departmental advice, in a move that would increase the price of petrol for taxpayers. Markson became media editor of The Australian newspaper in February 2014. There she was \\"noted for her aggressive pursuit of stories involving the ABC and Fairfax Media.\\" She shifted to a senior writing role in 2015, and in September 2016 was appointed National Political Editor for The Daily Telegraph.. She notably wrote front page stories on then Herald columnist, Mike Carlton's abusive and anti-semitic emails and tweets to readers in the midst of the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza. Markson's reporting led to the long-standing columnist's resignation from Fairfax. Fairfax's publisher, Sean Aylmer, told 2UE, \\"The issue wasn't the printing of the column. What sort of got him into trouble was the way he responded to those readers, and it was totally inappropriate, using very inappropriate language.\\" . A month after the coverage Markson was the subject of an anti-Semitic threat . Markson won a Walkley Award in 2018 alongside journalists Kylar Loussikian and Chris Dore for coverage of Barnaby Joyce's affair and \\"love child\\" with a parliamentary staffer, which ultimately led to Joyce's resignation as Australia's deputy prime minister.. The sensational front-page story, Bundle of Joyce, featured Joyce's girlfriend, Vicki Campion, walking across the street while pregnant. The story was initially met with controversy, with some journalists, commentators and politicians claiming the affair and pregnancy should have been kept secret from the public. Markson argued it was in the public interest to expose the hypocrisy of Joyce, who is a conservative politician who had campaigned on family values, opposed same- sex marriage and did not think women should get the cervical cancer vaccine because it might make them more promiscuous.. Later coverage by Markson revealed that Campion had been awarded jobs she was not qualified for in the officers of other government politicians and that Joyce had lied about the affair to then Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. The story led to Mr Turnbull announcing a \\"bonk ban\\" where ministers could not have sexual relations with their staff members. . In the same year Markson won a Kennedy Award for Journalism for Scoop of the Year and Political Journalist of the Year and the overall award for journalist of the year . In 2018, Markson won the Sir Keith Murdoch Award for Excellence in Journalism, which was presented to her by Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch at an award ceremony in Sydney. When presenting Markson with the award, Lachlan Murdoch said: \\"Through your bold, take-no- prisoners reporting you broke ripper stories day after day and shook and shook and shook the political landscape.\\" . As political editor of The Daily Telegraph, Markson also broke news of the impending leadership coup against Malcolm Turnbull by Peter Dutton. On August 17, 2018, Markson was the first to report Dutton was being urged to seize the leadership \\"within weeks\\" by conservative MPs unhappy with Malcolm Turnbull's leadership.. She followed up her story by breaking another story the next day that Dutton was seriously considering launching a challenge for the prime ministership . The coverage of the leadership coup led Markson to jointly win (along with David Speers) the 2019 Federal Parliamentary Press Gallery Journalist of the Year Award presented by the National Press Club of Australia. . In June 2018, she attended the AIJAC sponsored Rambam Fellowship Program in Israel, along with other journalists and politicians. According to The Australian Jewish News, \\"she found Israel to be an eye-opening experience as a journalist, but also discovered a deep emotional awakening inside her as an Australian Jew while visiting the Western Wall for the first time\\". Markson began hosting a self- titled weekly program on Sky News Live from 9 October 2018. The debut episode of Sharri was watched by 105,000 viewers over the course of an hour.üñâ. After returning from maternity leave, Markson's show shifted to Sunday nights at 6pm where her ratings reached 314,000 viewers. In 2019, Markson won another Kennedy Award for columnist of the year. Markson's work has occasionally attracted controversy. In November 2015, she was detained by Israeli security officials for breaching protocol during a visit to the Ziv Medical Centre in Safed. 2019 Federal Election Coverage During the Federal Election campaign, Markson took her five-month-old baby on the campaign trail where they traveled with the Prime Minister on the Prime Minister's private plane. Markson's baby was present for an exclusive sit-down interview with Prime Minister Scott Morrison. In May 2019, Markson was \\"mocked on twitter\\" after stating on air 8 days before the 2019 Federal election that the Coalition had a real chance to win; Markson's analysis defied the majority of polling and public opinion which expected an electoral victory for opposition leader Bill Shorten and rather predicted the Coalition would come to win the Federal Election by taking a few key seats in Victoria, New South Wales and crucially, Queensland. Markson later credited the Coalition victory to an incredible turnaround pulled off by leader Scott Morrison in key marginal areas. Early Career Markson began her journalism career as a copy girl at The Sunday Telegraph at the age of 16. She was promoted to the State Political Reporter, Canberra correspondent, and finally, Chief of Staff. She twice won the Young Journalist of the Year Award and did secondments at the New York Post and The Sun in London. As political reporter for The Sunday Telegraph in Canberra, Sharri revealed Tony Abbott missed the $42 million stimulus package vote in Parliament because he fell asleep after a night of drinking. She joined the Seven Network in 2011, and was part of a team of journalists who won a Walkley award for TV news reporting. As news editor at the Seven Network in 2011, Markson was commended in the Walkley Awards for an investigation that revealed the Deputy Premier, Andrew Stoner's rush to cash-in on the Solar Bonus Scheme subsidy for solar panels on his roof after then Premier Kristina Keneally announced it was shutting down. The coverage was cited as the first scandal of the new O'Farrell government. Editor of Cleo Magazine Markson was recruited as the Australian editor of Cleo in 2013. Her tenure as editor involved launching a fight for equal pay for men and women named \\"Ditch the pay GAP\\". The magazine also ran a prominent investigation into companies which were paying women less than men by examining the financial statements of 100 Australian companies. While editor, Markson made the decision to no longer mention sex on the magazine's cover.

Daughter of Christopher B. Coleman, secretary of the Indiana Historical Society and professor of history at Butler College, Richardson was born in Berlin and grew up in the Irvington neighborhood of Indianapolis. She graduated from Laurel School in Shaker Heights, Ohio, and attended Vassar College for two years before transferring to the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where she studied from 1925 until 1928. It was there that she met her future husband, Edgar Preston Richardson, a student of painting who later became an art historian. From 1928 to 1930 Richardson lived in Indianapolis. Constance lived in Detroit from 1931-1962 while Edgar worked at Detroit Institute of Arts, where he served as assistant director from 1933-1945, and as director from 1945-1962. Her first landscapes date to the summers the couple spent in Vermont and New York; she later worked along the Great Lakes before discovering the West, and many of her later works were painted in Wyoming. She exhibited widely and received numerous prizes. Richardson relocated with her husband to Delaware in 1962 when he became director of the Winterthur Museum. In 1985 she was living in Philadelphia. Many of her paintings are concerned with the effects of light on the figure and on the landscape. She also painted portraits and genre scenes in addition to landscapes; her work has been described as reminiscent of Edward Hopper. Richardson's 1930 painting Street Light, owned by the Indianapolis Museum of Art, was included in the inaugural exhibition of the National Museum of Women in the Arts, American Women Artists 1830‚Äì1930, in 1987. As of February 10, 2017, the Indianapolis Museum of Art owns three works by Richardson. The painting Fourth of July is owned by the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. As of July 20, 2020, the Detroit Institute of Arts owns six of her works. Letters between Richardson and her husband are currently held by the Archives of American Art.

Plot  Kuso depicts a series of four surreal vignettes about the mutated survivors of an earthquake that has destroyed Los Angeles. The vignettes are broken up throughout the film by animations, television static, and news reporters reporting on the earthquake; the news report is initially interrupted by Busdriver, who performs a jazz-spoken word number describing the earthquake.  Royal  * Written by Steven Ellison Missy and Kenneth are lovers who live in an apartment complex. On their first appearance, Missy is seen choking Kenneth as he masturbates, then singing him to sleep. However, Missy covers her neck with a cloth, and refuses to let Kenneth perform sexual acts on her. Kenneth attempts to play the piano for her to sing, but another voice joins them; Missy finally removes the cloth to reveal a talking boil on her neck. After initial revulsion, the boil talks Kenneth into letting it perform fellatio on him; he agrees, and they do so. Afterward, Kenneth responds in pleasure, having learned to enjoy the boil's presence, and names it Royal.  Mr. Quiggle  * Written by Steven Ellison and Zack Fox Up-and- coming rapper B lives in an apartment with interdimensional creatures Kazo and Mazu. After smoking from a bong and watching what appears to be a snuff film with them, B goes to the bathroom to take a pregnancy test but is forced to hide it when Phil, a man who raped B and got her pregnant, appears through her toilet. Having tested positive, B goes to Dr. Clinton's clinic for an abortion, where she meets Manuel, who is cured of his fear of breasts by Mr. Quiggle, a large bug living in Clinton's anus. B is offered a coat hanger for her abortion and leaves in disgust. She visits Phil to tell him she is pregnant, but Phil refuses to let her get an abortion; Kazo and Mazu subdue Phil and trap him within one of B's music videos. They then remove the fetus from B's body, and B suggests that they smoke the fetus.  Smear  * Written by Steven Ellison Charlie is a small man who goes to an exclusive school in the forest and is fed terrible food by his mother, which causes him to constantly need to defecate. Laughed out of his classroom for doing so in his pants, Charlie runs into the forest, where he finds a strange creature with only an anus-like orifice with a worm-like tongue. He feeds the creature some of his feces, which causes it to apparently evolve, growing a face in place of its tongue. On their second meeting, the creature transfers a beam of green light to Charlie's head, empowering him to stop going to school and overcome his mother at last. Charlie later feeds the creature dog feces, which causes it and its apparent offspring to vanish, leaving Charlie and the dog standing in the forest.  Sock  * Written by David Firth and Steven Ellison Angel, a woman crawling on the ground and eating concrete, tells herself she needs to sacrifice her baby. The voice of God speaks to her and tells her that her baby is missing and she will find it down a hole that she claims leads to Hell. Angel crawls into the hole, but slips and falls all the way down. She witnesses another man being consumed by a creature in the hole and is yelled at by Jenny, an inhabitant of the hole world. Angel is swallowed by another creature in the hole; she travels down a long, surreal tunnel, before coming up out of the ground inside a creature similar to the one from Smear, witnessing a large object flying over Los Angeles. After the credits, Busdriver performs another spoken-word piece about surviving the earthquake.

The platform produces material covering virtually all major topics, including politics, sports, fashion, technology, entertainment, business, science, and health, among others. Odyssey has over 15,000 contributing writers, 1,200 communities, and over 30 million readers across the country. Each community consists of at least 12 writers, a voluntary Editor-in-chief, and a content strategist based in the New York City headquarters. Within each team are opportunities for executive positions, like a contributing editor, social outreach specialist, recruitment director, and more, all on a voluntary basis. Writers have the opportunity to receive compensation for their articles based on the number of page views a contributor generates. Odyssey was co-founded by Evan Burns and Adrian France, two students from Indiana University, in 2014 under the Odyssey Media Group, Inc. The platform's users consist mostly of university and college students in the age range of 18-28, and its viewers mostly come from each individual user's social media networks, such as Facebook and Twitter.  History   Origins  In 2009, Evan Burns and Adrian France co-founded Odyssey Media Group, Inc. It started as a print publication, called The Odyssey, at Indiana University with a focus on Greek life and campus issues not generally covered by the university‚Äôs official news publication. Odyssey expanded itsprint publication to include Greek chapters at other universities, including San Diego State University, the University of South Carolina, the University of Arkansas and the University of Alabama.  Online transition and funding  In 2014, Odyssey was launched as an online publication and platform. In 2015 and early 2016, Odyssey received funding from various sources, totaling over $33 million. In February 2017, Odyssey laid off 53 employees, 1/3 of its staff. Evan Burns, the former CEO, was relieved of most major financial and management duties and was given the title executive chairman.  Business overview  Odyssey's users are required to apply to start writing articles; the requirements for these authors include having a ‚Äúunique perspective‚Äù and the ability to submit one piece per week. Odyssey's writers are divided into communities, most of which are college and university campuses, though users are not required to attend as a student at those campuses. Instead, users who do not attend a college or university can write for the community which is located nearest to them. Once a user has been approved, they can start posting content on the platform. Most pieces of content are reviewed in a three-tiered editing system, starting with volunteer editors, then moving on to an outsourced set of freelance copy editors, and finally back to a set of paid content strategists, employed by Odyssey. While users are not regularly paid, incentives for highly-viewed articles are given. Writers have the opportunity to receive compensation for their articles based on the number of page views a contributor generates.

With the Oregon Question resolved in 1846, he became the first settler of Cathlamet. Early life Birnie was born in Aberdeen, Scotland in 1799, emigrating to Lower Canada at the age of sixteen. At Montreal he joined the North West Company, and was appointed to serve as a junior clerk. Pacific Northwest During his time with the NWC, Birnie was largely stationed at Fort George, the entrep√¥t and administrative center of the Columbia District on the shoreline of the Columbia River. After the NWC was forcibly amalgamated into the Hudson's Bay Company in 1821, Birnie considered leaving the Pacific Coast. George Simpson convinced him to remain in the employ of the HBC as a clerk, finding his knowledge of the hazardous Columbia Bar of great value to the company. Throughout the 1820s and 1830s, Bernie was a part of several HBC efforts that reorganized the supply infrastructure of the Columbia Department. Notably he oversaw the opening of Fort Colvile, an important station along the developing York Factory Express. At various points he later managed at various times the Spokane House, the Dalles Post, Fort Okanogan and the relocation effort of Fort Simpson. He returned to Fort George from Fort Simpson in 1836. The following year he was stationed at Fort Umpqua, although in 1838 he was back at Fort George. For the remainder of his service with the HBC, he remained there, acting as a pilot through the Columbia River entrance for incoming vessels. In May 1840, Birnie piloted the Lausanne over the hazardous Columbia Bar. The vessel had incoming Methodists under Jason Lee, recruited to expand the Methodist Missionary efforts among indigenous cultures in the region. Joseph H. Frost was among them and later recorded that Birnie greeted the families with fresh milk and additional refreshments. Birnie was present at Fort George when United States Navy Lieutenant Charles Wilkes and members of the United States Exploring Expedition arrived. The group had previously sailed from the Kingdom of Hawaii and entered the Puget Sound for surveying of the shorelines. Wilkes proceeded to take a party overland with Cowlitz guides to follow the course of the Cowlitz River until its junction with the Columbia. Wilkes and his party were met by Birnie outside Fort George, despite it being past midnight. The fur trader fed the men and gave each a blanket to sleep with while in his dwelling. Later life In 1846 he and his family relocated and became the first settlers of Cathlamet, where he remained with his family until his death in 1864.

Comey's handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's email practices and whether Justice Department employees leaked information improperly during the run-up to the 2016 United States presidential election. In June 2018, Horowitz released his report, concluding that Peter Strzok and other FBI employees \\"brought discredit to themselves\\" and to the agency. He found that Comey indulged in ad-hoc decision making and did not follow FBI procedures, but that he was not motivated by any political bias. Another investigation into the FBI and Justice Department was launched by Horowitz in March 2018. This investigation targeted the FBI and Justice Department's filing of four FISA applications and renewals to surveil former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page and whether or not there was an abuse of this FISA process. A redacted version of the report of the investigation was released December 9, 2019. On November 18, 2019 Senator Lindsey Graham, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, announced that Horowitz would testify before the committee on December 11 regarding the investigation and provide recommendations on how judicial and investigative systems could be improved. Findings of FBI investigation of Russia and Trump On December 9, 2019, Horowitz released his report stating that the FBI found 17 ‚Äúbasic and fundamental‚Äù errors and omissions in its applications to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA Court), but did not find political bias during the investigation of Trump and Russia, nor did he find evidence that the FBI attempted to place people inside the Trump campaign or report on the Trump campaign.https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf However, in a Senate hearing, Horowitz stated he could not rule out political bias as a possible motivation. The report found that the FBI had a legal \\"authorized investigative purpose and with sufficient factual predication\\" to ask for court approval to begin surveillance of Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser.  Pandemic Response Accountability Committee  Horowitz appointed Glenn Fine to chair the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee (PRAC), but Trump removed Fine in early April 2020. That month, Horowitz became acting chair of the PRAC. Personal life In 2000, he married Alexandra Leigh Kauffman in Leesburg, Virginia. Kauffman is a former field producer for CNN covering economics and personal finance.

The game was released in Japan in September 2017, and worldwide the following month. The game is a collaboration between Koei Tecmo's Dynasty Warriors franchise and Nintendo and Intelligent Systems's Fire Emblem series. The game received generally positive reviews, with critics praising the combination of Fire Emblem and Dynasty Warriors gameplay and drawing favorable comparisons to Hyrule Warriors, originally released in 2014 for the Wii U. Gameplay Fire Emblem Warriors is a hack-and-slash action role-playing game similar to the Dynasty Warriors series in which players take the role of Rowan and Lianna, and characters from several Fire Emblem games. Games represented in Warriors include Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light, Fire Emblem Gaiden, Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade, Fire Emblem Awakening, and Fire Emblem Fates. The player defeats enemies with any character, accomplishing specific goals to beat maps. In addition to hack-and-slash combat, the game includes the ability to give tactical commands to units and the Weapon Triangle, which originated from the Fire Emblem series. Weapons in the game include axes, lances, swords, bows, tomes, and dragonstones. When characters assist, heal, or fight alongside each other in battle, their bond strengthens. Like in Fire Emblem games, if two characters' bond increases enough, a support conversation will be unlocked. The game will also utilize all existing and future Fire Emblem Amiibo figurines, which give weapons related to the character represented by the Amiibo that is used. Plot While the royal twins of Aytolis, Rowan and Lianna spar with their friend Prince Darios of Gristonne, the kingdom is suddenly attacked by monsters. The three are separated from their mother, Aytolis's Queen Yelena during the attack, who gives them the Shield of Flames before being captured. The group learns that Darios' father Oskar is seeking to revive the evil Chaos Dragon Velezark, and that they must power up the Shield of Flames with Gleamstones created from the power of heroes from other worlds to prevent Velezark's resurrection. Rowan and Lianna travel across Aytolis, rallying support from heroes from the otherworldy nations of Ylisse, Hoshido, Nohr, and Altea. During an attack on a Gristonne fortress, Velezark successfully possesses Darios, who steals the Shield of Flames just after it is complete. Rowan and Lianna pursue him to Gristonne, where they discover Yelena has been captured to be used as a sacrifice to revive Velezark. Rowan and Lianna successfully rescue their mother, leading to Darios sacrificing Oskar to complete the ritual to revive Velezark. Now freed from the possession, Darios returns the Shield of Flames to the group before falling to his death. Rowan, Lianna, and the other heroes then battle Velezark and finally slay him. With Velezark slain, the other heroes return to their home worlds and Queen Yelena crowns the twins as rulers of Aytolis. Development and release Promotion at Gamescom 2017 Fire Emblem Warriors was developed by the same team as Hyrule Warriors, a collaboration between the Dynasty Warriors series and The Legend of Zelda. The game was co-developed by Koei Tecmo studios Omega Force and Team Ninja and Fire Emblem developers Intelligent Systems. Koei Tecmo first proposed the project to Nintendo, who were more than willing to collaborate, making the game a title for their in-development Nintendo Switch home console. The idea of the game came during the development of Hyrule Warriors Legends, as the touchscreen controls bore similarities to those of the Fire Emblem series. The game was announced in January 2017 as part of a Nintendo Direct broadcast dedicated to the Fire Emblem series, although it had already been in development for around two years before this time. It was released in Japan on September 28, 2017, and released in North America, Europe, and Australia on October 20, 2017. Downloadable content Three packs of paid additional content were announced before the game's release. Each pack added three new playable characters, new support conversations, and three new maps for History mode, in addition to new weapons, costumes, and other content. Each of the DLC on a different Fire Emblem game: Fire Emblem Fates, Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon, and Fire Emblem Awakening respectively. If all three packs were bought together in the season pass, an additional costume was unlocked.  Reception  Fire Emblem Warriors received mixed to positive reviews according to reviews, with the Nintendo Switch version holding a Metacritic score of 74/100 based on 72 critic reviews and the New Nintendo 3DS version receiving a score of 69/100 based on 12 reviews. The game received praise for bringing a more nuanced, textured experience to the musou genre, but drew criticism for its shallow take on traditional Fire Emblem mechanics and roster choice. The Nintendo Switch version sold 41,491 copies within its first week on sale on Japan, whilst the 3DS version sold 18,357 copies. In April 2018, Koei Tecmo revealed that the game sold 1 million copies worldwide.

There are gardens in the area of the wye, but no station. Passengers can change between trains in Werdau, Zwickau, Lichtentanne, Reichenbach in the Vogtland or Neumark.  History With the completion by the S√§chsisch- Bayerische Eisenbahn-Compagnie (Saxon-Bavarian Railway Company, from 1847: K√∂niglich S√§chsische Staatseisenbahnen‚ÄîRoyal Saxon State Railways) of the railway from Leipzig to Werdau (Leipzig‚ÄìHof railway) on 6 September 1845, the 8.10 km-long branch to Zwickau was also opened. With the further commissioning of the line towards Reichenbach on 31 May 1846, a junction was opened that later developed into Werdau wye. Three different connecting points had originally been considered for the connection to the Albertsbahn (Albert Railway), which opened in Dresden in 1855. The stations of Werdau and G√∂√ünitz were considered important as connecting points for the coal traffic from the Lugau-Oelsnitz coal district. Werdau was ideally situated for direct trains to the south towards Hof, but G√∂√ünitz was preferable for connecting to Leipzig. A third variant, Crimmitschau was also investigated as a connection point. Ultimately, a route to Zwickau and a connecting line branching off from Sch√∂nb√∂rnchen near Glauchau was selected. Construction began on the connecting railway on 25 June 1855 and construction of the main line towards Zwickau began on 15 November 1855. The two new lines were opened on 15 November 1858. The double-tracked Zwickau‚ÄìNeumark connecting curve had already been opened at the former Werdau junction on 1 January 1856. More than ten years later, on 1 March 1869, the continuous connection from Dresden was completed with the closure of the gap between Freiberg and Fl√∂ha. Since then, the Werdau wye has had more than regional importance as a connecting point for rail transport between Silesia and Southern Germany. At the beginning of October 1989 there were massive, violent attacks by the Volkspolizei (East German police) on people waving and cheering the trains carrying refugees from the West German Embassy in Prague to West Germany.  Multi-regional importance  With its connection between the Dresden‚ÄìWerdau and Leipzig‚ÄìHof railway lines, the Werdau wye has a significance that extends beyond Saxony. It is part of the Saxon-Franconian trunk line (Sachsen-Franken-Magistrale) and is included in the plans for the Mid-Germany Railway (Mitte-Deutschland-Verbindung).

It also acquired the bus producer Jiangxi Coach and Bus Co., Ltd. In March 2011, Hengtian Heavy Industry incorporated Hebei Lida Special Vehicle Co., Ltd. In June 2010, Jingwei Textile Machinery, another CHTC subsidiary, incorporated truck manufacturer Hubei Xinchufeng Automobile Co., Ltd. and reincorporated parts of it as Hengtian (CHTC) Automobile Co., Ltd. In May 2011, CHTC reincorporated Nanchang Kama Diesel Engine Co., Ltd. as Hengtian (CHTC) Power Co., Ltd. In November 2011, CHTC acquired pick-up and truck manufacturer Dadi Auto and reincorporated it on 16 October 2012 as Hengtian (CHTC) Dadi Automobile Co., Ltd. In 2012, CHTC unveiled the first CHTC-badged pick-ups, based on Dadi technology, the Tutengs T1 and T2. A third pickup, the Tuteng T3 (an upmarket version of the T2), was launched in 2013. In June 2017, it was announced that CHTC would take control of a 15.24% stake in truck and special vehicle manufacturer Hualing Xingma from the Xingma Group, becoming the largest shareholder. The ultimate owner of the stake would change from the Maanshan Municipal People's Government to the SASAC. As part of the deal, Hualing Xingma would acquire CHTC's Hubei Xinchufeng in exchange of shares. In August 2017, Hualing Xingma announced that various complexities would stop Hubei Xinchufeng acquisition, but the agreement for CHTC taking a stake was still in place. In October 2017, CHTC announced the agreement was cancelled, as there were not enough safeguards for the investment. =International= In January 2012, CHTC acquired the Dutch truck manufacturer GINAF. In 2013, through a joint venture, it acquired the assets of Slovenian bus manufacturer TAM.

It consisted of a 3081 Processor Unit with supporting units. Later models in the series were the 3083 and the 3084. The 3083 was announced March 31 and the 3084 on September 3, both in 1982. The IBM 308X line introduced the System/370 Extended Architecture. All three 308X systems, which IBM had marketed as \\"System/370-Compatibles,\\"http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/mainframe/mainframe_FS370C.html were withdrawn August 4, 1987. IBM 3081 The initial 3081 offered, the 3081D, was a 5 MIPS machine. The next offering, the 3081K, was a 7 MIPS machine. Last came the 3081G. The 3081D was announced Nov 12, 1980; the 3081K came nearly a year later; the 3081G was introduced September 3, 1982 as part of the initial 3084 announcement. \\"The IBM 3081 Processor Complex offers flexible growth steps in the 308X family of processors, between the 3083 Model Groups F, B and J and the 3084.\\" The 3081 was \\"two processors in a single box ... it was not possible to partition it and run it as two independent machines.\\" The dyadic concept offers \\"under the cover\\" dual processors. 3081 as successor to 3033 Some key technological features of the 3081, compared to the previous most powerful processor, the 3033, were the following: *About 800,000 circuits implemented in large scale integration, using up to 704 logic circuits per chip, which provided the required performance, reliability, and serviceability that were design goals *\\"Elimination of one complete level of packaging, the card level\\" *Water cooling, which provides heat removal from chips beyond the ability of conventional air cooling * A machine cycle time of 26 nanoseconds (38 MHz equivalent CPU) * Reduced power consumption, 23 kilowatts for a 3081-D16 versus 68 kilowatts for a 3033-U16 * Approximately double the instruction- execution rate of the 3033 * Two central processor components Both central processors have access to channels (as many as 24), and main memory (up to 32 megabytes32√ó220 bytes). The elimination of a layer of packaging was achieved through the development of the Thermal Conduction Module (TCM), a flat ceramic module containing about 30,000 logic circuits on up to 118 chips. The TTL chips (which were not compatible with the TTL chips sold on the open market by many manufacturers) were joined face-down (sometimes called \\"flip chip\\") to the TCM with an array of 11 √ó 11 solder pads. The TCM contains 33 metalized layers which distribute signals and power. \\"A module is connected to the next level of packaging through 1800 pins (1200 are available for signals, 500 pins are available for power, and 100 pins are spare).\\" (p. 7) The module is fitted with a helium-filled metal cap, which contains one piston per chip; the piston presses against the back of each chip to provide a heat conduction path from the chip to the cap. A water-cooled cold plate is attached to the cap; the water temperature is approximately 24 ¬∞C. This arrangement provides cooling of the module heat flux on the order of 105 watts per square meter, which is about a tenfold increase over the 3033 processor. The internal code name of the 3081 was Adirondack. Miniaturization has resulted in smaller sizes than the above SLT Card Frame IBM 3083 The IBM 3083 was described by an IBMer as \\"never intended to be built,\\" adding that the 308X was to only be the 3081 and 3084, and that the 3083 was aimed at \\"the ACP/TPF market\\" which wanted a \\"fast... uniprocessor.\\" Of the various 3083 models listed by IBM in their announcement, the CX has the slowest instruction execution rate. Next in speed are the E and EX, followed by B and BX. The J and JX are the fastest 3083s. IBM's information sheet says: * The 3083 Model CX has an instruction execution rate of about 0.75 times that of a 3083 Model EX. * The 3083 Models B and BX have an instruction execution rate ranging from 1.4 to 1.5 times the 3083 Models E and EX, respectively. * The 3083 Models J and JX have an instruction execution rate ranging from 1.8 to 2.0 times the 3083 Models E and EX, respectively. Collectively, the fastest is 2.667 times the performance of the slowest.range of relative performance = 2.0 / 0.75 IBM 3084 Announced September 3, 1982 and withdrawn August 4, 1987. It could be configured with 32, 48 or 64 million bytes of main memory.

Edward (1919‚Äì2007) was an Australian abstract artist, mosaicist and teacher. He was born in Victoria on 26 August 1919. Edward studied at the National Gallery Art School from 1938‚Äì41 under Charles Wheeler and W.B. McInnes. For 31 years he was associated with the Art School at the Royal Melbourne Technical College (and former Working Men's College) now known as RMIT, where he had been a student, and where he was teacher 1947‚Äì1954, head of painting, 1954‚Äì67 and head of school 1967‚Äì79. As head of the art department, Edward set up an initiative for systematically developing the RMIT Art Collection, and to make Australian art more accessible to staff and students. He retired from RMIT in August 1979, after which he made many painting trips to Australia's outback. His semi-abstract work was exhibited widely in Melbourne, Sydney and Perth and described by Professor Bernard Smith as \\"a perceptive art with its own quiet distinction\\". He described his approach to abstraction as simply wanting \\"to place sequences of shapes, colours and tones on a surface in an abstract manner, like the notes of a Bach fugue\\". Edward also undertook mural commissions for the Victoria Housing Commission, and for church mosaic panels. One of his murals made of glass mosaic tiles can be seen on the old State Library of Queensland building at 159 William St, Brisbane. This was the winning entry in an Australia-wide competition for a mural to adorn the walls of the Brisbane Public Library in time for the 100-year celebration of responsible government in Queensland in 1959. On winning the competition in 1958, Edward explained that his mosaic design was not a literal subject but rather a 'basic formation of organic forms indicating growth and development'. Photographs of the winning mural were exhibited in Melbourne at Gallery A in September 1960, and were thought to \\"reveal a quality in design related in strength to figure compositions on Greek pottery\\". This mural contributed to the listing of the former State Library Building on the State Heritage Register in 1992. Edward's mural is discussed in the book Monumental Queensland: sign posts on a cultural landscape. A close-up image of the mural taken by Graham de Gruchy can be seen at the UQ eSpace Library. Edward had around 20 solo exhibitions of his work between 1944-1993. In the 1950s he showed paintings at many Melbourne galleries, including Stanley Coe Gallery, Peter Bray Gallery, the Victorian Artists' Society Galleries, and Gallery A. In the 1970s he exhibited in other Melbourne galleries - the Warehouse Galleries, Realities Galleries and Powell St Gallery and in the 1980s and 1990s at David Ellis and the Eastgate Galleries in Hawthorn. In Sydney he exhibited at the Holdsworth Gallery and in Perth, the Quentin Gallery. He also exhibited at the RMIT Gallery in October 1979 on the occasion of his retirement. His work is held in numerous collections, including the National Gallery of Victoria, the National Gallery of Australia, ArtBank, and several regional and tertiary galleries in Victoria, including RMIT. Lindsay Edward died on 9 January 2007. His obituary was written by Jenny Zimmer who taught art history at RMIT during his time there, and was published in The Age.

Willie \\"61\\" Blackwell (born December 25, 1905 - 1972) was an American country blues guitarist and pianist. As an iterinant performer who played mainly on street corners and juke joints, Blackwell did not have a prolific career, but did record with musicologist Alan Lomax in 1942 and was rediscovered during the blues revival of the 1960s.  Biography  Blackwell was born in LaGrange, Tennessee. He was introduced to the basics of the guitar by his father and neighbors, but, until the late 1930s, Blackwell performed on the piano in juke joints in Memphis. According to Blackwell's account however, after winning a competition against a rival musician, his adversary's friends beat Blackwell, crippling his hands. Undeterred and still hoping to pursue his music career, Blackwell requainted himself with the guitar, and allegedly received lessons from renown blues musician Robert Johnson. Travelling on Route 61, Blackwell became an iterinant musician, earning himself the nickname \\"61\\" for his regular use of the route as he performed up and down the Mississippi Valley and in New Orleans. In 1942, while on Beale Street in Memphis with fellow musician William Brown, Blackwell met Alan Lomax, a musicologist collecting field recordings of authentic country blues. Admittedly, Lomax was more interested in recording Brown than Blackwell who had taken to drinking moonshine, making it difficult for him to stay awake. From Lomax's own account in his book The Land Where the Blues Began, he took Blackwell and Brown to an Arkansas plantation in July 1942 to escape persecution from police for associating with the black musicians. Lomax recorded eight songs with Blackwell which were released on Bluebird Records and preserved by the Library of Congress. Following the session with Lomax, Blackwell never recorded again and kept a low profile, but his work was later rediscovered in the 1960s by blues historians Sam Stark and Ron Harwood, the latter of whom wrote about Blackwell in Jazz Journal, in 1967. Blackwell died in 1972.

In a similar town, there is a nitwit named \\"Namdev\\", who returns to his town in the wake of getting hitched to \\"Bakula\\". According to the customs, he goes straight to Ghotale's home with his better half to look for his gifts. Be that as it may, one take a gander at his significant other and Ghotale is left confused. He is completely amazed by Bakula and falls head over heels in affection with her. Without even a second's pause, he chooses in his brain to get hitched to her, by snare or by hooligan. In spite of Namdev being a vital piece of Bakula's life, Ghotale tries to charm her in his own specific manner. Namdev, thus, tries to keep her out of Ghotale's path and in this disarray, all Bakula needs is to lead a glad wedded existence with her better half.

Due to its specialized habitat, it has a highly localized range, found only on the Cumberland Plateau and in the Ouachita Mountains. Natural history This species is found only is a specialized riverine habitat that is kept open by extreme flood scouring events. These flood events naturally occur in high-gradient, rocky rivers, which results in the prevention of large tree growth. This species takes advantage of the prairie-like openings these floods create.Calamovilfa arcuata Missouri Botanical Garden Due to its specialized habitat, and low density of populations, Calamovilfa arcuata is considered imperiled. On the Cumberland Plateau, it is most often found on sandstone cobble where it co-occurs with two other rare plants that are also restricted to this habitat: Conradina verticillata (Cumberland rosemary) and Solidago arenicola (sand goldenrod). This species produces flowers in late summer, at the time when the chances of a scouring flood occurring are lessened. Taxonomy Calamovilfa arcuata was first described to science in 1970 from a population found on Daddys Creek in Cumberland County, Tennessee. Recent genetic evidence suggests that this species, along with the rest of the genus Calamofilva, are perhaps best instead included in the genus Sporobolus, although this change has yet to receive widespread recognition.

The monument was the first U.S. National Monument dedicated to the Reconstruction Era.Jennifer Schuessler, President Obama Designates First National Monument Dedicated to Reconstruction, New York Times (January 12, 2017). The John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act, signed March 12, 2019, re-designated it as a national historical park. It is administered by the National Park Service. Creation of the monument The campaign to create a Reconstruction Era National Monument spanned fifteen years, beginning in the final days of the Bill Clinton administration, when outgoing Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt visited the Beaufort area, accompanied by historian Eric Foner, author of the book Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863‚Äì1877. The initial effort to create the national monument failed in Congress amid opposition from the Sons of Confederate Veterans.Bill Rauch, Can the South Make Room for Reconstruction?, The Atlantic (September 17, 2016). In 2004, when the creation of a Beaufort Reconstruction History Park was being considered, the Sons of Confederate Veterans organized a campaign to persuade U.S. Representative Joe Wilson (who then represented the area of the proposed park) to oppose it. After receiving letters from the group's members and meeting with the group, Wilson told the National Park Service that he would not support the park. The proposal was revived in 2015, however, after two historians commissioned by the Park Service‚ÄîGregory Downs of the University of California, Davis and Kate Masur of Northwestern University‚Äîundertook a field study of sites associated with the Reconstruction era and issued a report entitled National Historical Landmark Theme Study on the U.S. Reconstruction Era, 1861‚Äì1898.Hilary Hurd Anyaso, Historian's work foundation of new national monument, Northwestern Now, Northwestern University (January 30, 2017). At an April 2016 symposium entitled \\"The Reconstruction Era: History and Public Memory\\" in Columbia, South Carolina, sponsored by Historic Columbia and the University of South Carolina History Center, Downs, Masur, and others spoke. At that symposium, a Park Service official indicated that opposition to the proposed national monument from the Sons of Confederate Veterans had softened. Two U.S. Representatives from South Carolina, Democrat Jim Clyburn and Republican Mark Sanford (whose district has included Beaufort since redistricting in 2010), were major champions of the monument's designation and had sought to create the monument via an act of Congress.Emma Dumain, Just under the wire, Obama establishes national monument to Reconstruction era in Beaufort County, The Post & Courier (January 12, 2017).

The great-great-grandson of Robert Smalls‚Äîa freed slave who rose to become a member of Congress from South Carolina during Reconstruction‚Äîwas a supporter of the monument's designation. The Reconstruction Era National Monument, created in the final days of President Obama's term, was established on the same day as two National Monuments honoring the American civil rights movement: the Freedom Riders National Monument and the Birmingham Civil Rights National Monument.Melanie Eversley, Obama designates 3 civil rights sites as national monuments, USA Today (January 12, 2017).

(originally Penn School): Founded in 1862, this was an early school in the South for freed slaves. In 1864, it moved to its current location (now part of the monument) on Saint Helena Island. Even before the national monument was declared, Penn Center was part of a National Historic Landmark District. It is significant not only for its association with Reconstruction and civil rights, but also as a center of Gullah cultural heritage. * Brick Baptist Church: Located next to Penn Center, this church building was constructed in 1855 \\"by slaves who were relegated to its balcony out of the sight and presence of white worshipers.\\" In 1861, after the Battle of Port Royal, some 8,000 freed slaves took control of the church. It is the oldest church on Saint Helena Island. * The Old Beaufort Firehouse (706 Craven Street) in downtown Beaufort, near other historically significant sites.

Sites The Freedom Riders National Monument comprises two locations, one in downtown Anniston itself and the other outside town. Greyhound Bus Station The first site designated as part of the national monument is the former Greyhound bus depot at 1031 Gurnee Avenue in Anniston, where, on May 14, 1961, a mob attacked an integrated group of white and black Freedom Riders who demanded an end to racial segregation in interstate busing. The mob slashed the bus's tires, threw rocks, broke the bus's windows, and pursued the bus after it pulled away from the depot.Freedom Riders National Monument, The Conservation Fund (last accessed April 28, 2017). Today the wall of the building adjacent to the former depot features a mural and educational panels describing the incident; a similar mural has been installed adjacent to the former Trailways station where the other Freedom Riders arrived in 1961. The former Greyhound station was later owned by the City of Anniston prior to its donation to the United States government. It is one of nine sites that are part of the Anniston Civil Rights and Heritage Trail, and is commemorated with a historic marker, erected in 2016. The National Park Service, in conjunction with the city of Anniston, has announced plans to develop the building and open it to the public, but as of May 2017 it was closed to visitors. Site of bus burning The second site incorporated into the new national monument is that of the bus burning, located outside of Anniston along Old Birmingham Highway/State Route 202 some away from the Greyhound station. It was at this spot that the bus broke down because of its flat tires. The segregationist mob, which had followed it from the bus depot, continued its assault, throwing \\"a bundle of flaming rags into the bus that exploded seconds later\\" which set the vehicle ablaze. The mob attacked the passengers as they tried to flee.

It was announced in 2010 that five acres of land surrounding the site of the bus burning had been donated to Calhoun County for the development of a memorial park; initial plans called for a landscaped walkway, with interpretive plaques to be erected at the site. Possible future features include a statue of Hank Thomas, a survivor of the incident, being given water by nearby resident Janie Forsythe. Since designation of the national monument, the National Park Service, Calhoun County, and the Freedom Riders Memorial Committee have begun working together to develop a plan for interpreting the site; Alabama Power provided money for the effort in 2015. A sign denoting the future presence of the park was erected in 2012. Soon after it was placed at the site it was vandalized, but repairs were quickly made. The site of the burning is today surrounded by private residences. History of the monument Designation of the national monument followed a visit by Interior Secretary Sally Jewell and National Park Service Director Jonathan Jarvis to the site in October 2016.Ben Cunningham, The Anniston Greyhound terminal: A building's route through time, Anniston Star (October 24, 2016).

Others who supported its establishment included Senator Richard Shelby; Representative Mike Rogers, who had introduced a bill to designate Freedom Riders National Historical Park in July 2016; and governor Robert J. Bentley. A dedication ceremony took place on May 13, 2017, in downtown Anniston, on the day before the 56th anniversary of the incident; some members of the audience had traveled from as far away as Denmark.

An interim visitors' center, including a station where visitors may procure a National Parks passport stamp, has been established in the reception area of Anniston City Hall. In 2017, the National Park Service sought input from the public on planning and interpreting the National Monument. Federal and local officials began drafting formal plans for its management late in 2017. In March 2018, the Anniston City Council commissioned Jacksonville State University to conduct an economic impact study for the monument.Daniel Gaddy, Anniston council OKs economic study for Freedom Riders monument, Anniston Star (March 20, 2018).

A spark extinguishing system can detect and eliminate ignition sources before a fire or dust explosion occurs. Systems for grinding, chopping, drying, cooling and pressing materials including their pneumatic or mechanical transport and extraction systems and facilities for separation or storage purposes, also dust collectors, filters, cyclones, silos, and hoppers are especially at risk. In industrial production, raw materials are reduced in size to a high degree. Therefore, pneumatic or mechanical conveying paths are a principal component of production facilities. However, not only the \\"planned\\" dusts and bulk goods are transported via this connection. Sparks or smouldering particles may also be generated in processing machines or dryers and are therefore a significant fire and explosion hazard for downstream system parts including filters and silos. A fire or a dust explosion is caused if three conditions are met: combustible dusts, air (oxygen) and an ignition source, (explosions also require confinement and material disbursement into the air). If these conditions occur, a fire may occur. The removal of one of these conditions will greatly reduce the risk of a fire or explosion. Since the combustible dust cannot be eliminated, there is the possibility to use inert gases or to eliminate ignition sources. Spark extinguishing systems are established as preventive fire and explosion protection systems in the industry and craft. Nowadays, many industries could not be operated economically without spark extinguishing systems. Technically they are the only preventive fire protection. Other measures, such as explosion suppression or sprinkler systems, are called reactive measures. Spark and fire generation Fire or dust explosion can always be generated if combustible material, as for example highly refined raw materials, and oxygen (ambient air) exist and an ignition source reaches the minimum ignition energy at the same time. Due to air calming and material density in filters and silos and the associated material/oxygen relation, these areas are extremely endangered. Nearly all production facilities face this risk potential. In most cases, the conditions for fires or dust explosions are not met in pneumatic conveying paths. So it is possible to equip these systems with spark extinguishing systems as preventive fire and dust explosion protection. Using a spark extinguishing system, ignition sources are detected during transport and mostly eliminated without interrupting production.  Structure and operating mode of a spark extinguishing system  The fire extinguishing system has three main elements: the control console, the spark detectors, and the automatic extinguishing system. The control console is the center of a spark extinguishing system. It receives signals from detectors and activate preprogramed countermeasures. All signals of the individual spark detectors from different parts of the facility come together at the control console. The connected extinguishing equipment or the alarm relay output of the corresponding detection zone is activated without delay. Spark detectors are used to detect ignition sources. They detect the infrared radiation emitted by sparks or smoldering particles ‚Äì sometimes even through the dust layer or the transported material. If sparks are detected in the system, the spark detectors send alarm signals to the control console which evaluates these signals and automatically initiates specific countermeasures. Different spark detectors are available depending on the place of use or the application; spark detectors for use with very high product temperatures or for spark detection under daylight influence are examples. In most cases extinguishing is done with water. The automatic extinguishing device is installed in direction of the conveying flow downstream of the spark detectors. Spark detectors and extinguishing device must be arranged in a certain distance to ensure that the detected ignition source can be extinguished reliably. This distance is called quenched spark gap and is calculated based on the transport speed of the material and the system-related delay time. The automatic extinguishing devices temporarily generate a water fog in the pipe section for sparks to fly into. If no more sparks are detected, the injection is stopped automatically; production can continue without any problem. Mainly water is used as extinguishing agent as it reaches an excellent extinguishing effect thanks to its very high heat reduction capacity. By extracting heat, the spark or ember is cooled down. An optimal extinguishing effect is achieved by the specific surface of the water being kept as large as possible which is reached by a very fine nebulization of the water. A special nozzle and sufficient process water pressure provide for the nebulization degree. Also hydrophobic substances, such as rubber or plastic, can be extinguished or the water quantity can be minimized by adding relaxant agents. In some cases, water is not appropriate as extinguishing agent (e.g. light metals cannot be extinguished using water) or the process is disturbed (e.g. gluing in the sugar industry). Therefore, deflectors for material bypassing purposes or sliders and flaps to shut off the conveying flow are used in such systems. The reaction times of these mechanical systems are as short as the water extinguishing. Operating mode of a spark extinguishing system in a pneumatic conveying line The pneumatic conveying line is equipped with spark detectors to detect sparks and hot or glowing particles. The detected ignition sources are extinguished at lightning speed by an automatically activated extinguishing device ‚Äì mostly without production interruption. The reaction time only amounts to approx. 100 ‚Äì 300 milliseconds. The extinguishing agent water is given preference to possible alternatives as it is quickly effective and due to the quick cooling effect unsurpassed for this special case of use. Operating mode of a spark extinguishing system in a mechanical conveying path Mechanical conveying lines are equipped with spark detectors preferentially at material transfer points, e.g. at drop shafts. Due to the loosened product flow, the sparks or the hot spots are extinguished immediately, as in is the case in pneumatic conveying lines. History  The history of spark extinguishing systems goes back to the early seventies, when the Federal Anti-Pollution Law (BImSchG) of 1974 required the use of exhaust and dedusting systems in the wood-based material industry. For this purpose, operators of chipboard and fibre board facilities were committed to comply with the administrative regulations called Technical Instructions on Air Quality. Flying sparks representing a risk for the downstream filter systems were caused in the exhaust and dedusting systems by foreign bodies or defective machine parts. A solution to the problem was necessary to avoid the risk of serious fires and explosions. This technology made it possible to detect and extinguish ignition sources in a fraction of seconds during operation. Fields of application of spark extinguishing systems A fire and explosion hazard caused by sparks or hot particles exists everywhere where combustible material is machined or processed, transported, filtered or dried. A spark extinguishing system can prevent fires and dust explosions. Nowadays the safety concept originally developed for the wood industry notably MDF production, chipboard production, OSB production, plywood production can be transferred to all producing industries. * Recycling industry * Pellet fuel production * Food industry * Chemical industry * Textile industry * Metal industry * Furniture industry * Power station * Pulp and paper industry * Animal feed * Tobacco industry * Hygiene * Automotive industry * Milling (grinding) * Tire recycling * Flour production * Sugar industry * Coffee industry * Cocoa industry.

It is also the first main Bomberman entry in over six years, as well as being the first to be developed following the dissolution of original series developer Hudson Soft on March 1, 2012. The game received mixed reviews, though many of the criticisms were addressed with post-release patches. By August 2018, the game had sold over a million units worldwide. Its battle royale spin-off, Super Bomberman R Online, was released on Stadia on September 1, 2020. Gameplay Super Bomberman R is an action game in which players move through a two-dimensional grid environment and must trap and drop bombs to defeat their opponents. The game features story mode spanning 50 stages and supports cooperative gameplay for two players. The game also features an eight-player competitive multiplayer mode. The online mode contains a league system (Baby A/B, Novice A/B, Amateur A/B, Pro A/B, Champ A/B and God A/B). Starting in Baby league B the player has to win matches to gather and earn points for advancement. Battle mode includes 19 battlegrounds in total. Besides the classic arena, it also offers a multi-level arena with springboards, ice-patterns, moveable blocks, etc., each with a unique style. In addition to the eight Bomberman Bros. and the Five Dastardly Bombers, Super Bomberman R also features a selection of new characters based on Konami Originals, such as Dracula Bomber, Vic Viper Bomber, Goemon Bomber and more. In total, there are 27 characters, each with special abilities. Grand Prix was introduced with an update in November 2017. It contains 3 vs 3 battles in offline or online matches within 3 different arenas. Alongside new characters (with unique abilities) the player's goal is to collect as many gems as possible within the given time. Alternate mode is team fight which counts the total wins (blow-ups). Characters Alucard Bomber's special ability is Mist („Éü„Çπ„Éà, misuto). He can transform into a ball of mist for about one second. During this time, he is invulnerable to explosions and hazards, and can pass through bombs. His movement speed does not change. When the effect ends, he pauses in place to revert to his base form; this pause also lasts about one second. There is a cooldown of about seven seconds before he can use Mist again. Option Bomber A & B - Trace: Copies the abilities and special abilities of characters upon contact. Reiko Bomber - Body Shield: Activates a surrounding shield that blocks characters and bomb blasts from entering. Shiori Fujisaki Bomber - Tokimeki Field: Stops all nearby characters from moving for a short time. Jehuty Bomber - Zero Shift A: Warps next to the first opponent in the direction the character is facing, up to a maximum of 8 squares away. Anubis Bomber - Zero Shift B: Swaps positions with the first opponent in the direction the character is facing, up to a maximum of 8 squares away. Dracula Bomber - Dark Curse: Set up to 4 invisible magic circles that deflect bombs placed on top of them. Princess Tomato Bomber - Princess Light: Characters touched will become immune to explosions. Bubble Head Bomber - Cursed: Inflict the Skull effect on yourself. Goemon Bomber - Oedo Blaster: Place as many bombs as possible in front of you. Simon Belmont Bomber - whip can also stun opponents. Magnet Bomber will slide towards opponents if they're in the bomb's lane. Golem Bomber Golem Bomber's special ability is the Golem Bomb („Ç¥„Éº„É¨„É†„Éú„É†, g≈çremu bomu). This alternate bomb type is heavy, and cannot be punched or kicked by any character other than Golem Bomber or another copy of him. Any character hit by a punched or thrown Golem Bomb, including Golem Bomber himself, w Phantom Bomber can drop fake bombs to throw opponents off. Karaoke/Sexy Bomber (and another character) has a proximity bomb that will automatically explode if an opponent is in its radius. Plasma Bomber drops a bomb with a unique timer. The longer you hold the special button, the longer the timer on the bomb. If you simply tap the button, it'll explode in half of the time of a regular bomb. Pretty Bomber Octopus Bomber Pyramid Head Bomber Dracula Bomber Vic Viper Bomber Max Bomber (Nintendo Switch Exclusive) Ratchet & Clank Bomber (Rachet & Clank Series, PS4 exclusive) Master Chief Bomber (Halo Series, Xbox One Exclusive) P-Body Bomber (Portal Series, Steam Exclusive) Xavier Woods Bomber Ayako Katagiri Bomber's special ability is the Tokimeki Love Song („Å®„Åç„ÇÅ„Åç„É©„Éñ„ÇΩ„É≥„Ç∞, tokimeki rabusongu). When activated, she will stand still and sing for three seconds. She can cancel this ability at any time by pressing the special ability button again. There is no cooldown for using this ability normally. However, when a character touches Ayako Katagiri Bomber during her song, the song ends immediately, and there will then be a ten second cooldown before Ayako Katagiri Bomber can trigger the ability again. While Ayako Katagiri Bomber is singing, any character who touches her will gain an \\"Action Power Up\\" effect, which gives them the Punch, Bomb Kick, and Power Glove abilities for thirty seconds. This does not generate new item panels. If a character who has been granted the Power Glove is still holding a bomb when the effect ends, they will still be able to carry the bomb indefinitely and throw it on command. However, if the character kicks a bomb, they cannot stop the kicked bomb after the effect ends. If a character who has the Action Power Up effect touches Ayako Katagiri Bomber during her song, the effect's length will be reset to thirty seconds. Toro Plot The game features a rebooted plot of previous Super Bomberman games. It starts in a robot scrapyard, where Emperor Buggler resurrects five robots to be his new henchmen, the Five Dastardly Bombers. Meanwhile, on Planet Bomber, live the Bomberman Brothers; eight robotic lifeforms created to be heroes of the universe. Unfortunately, only the eldest brother, White, has the mentality and discipline associated with this role and has no luck getting his younger siblings to take their mission seriously. Black is a self-absorbed slacker, Pink is more concerned about fashion and gossip, Blue sleeps all day, Red is an out-of-control hothead, Yellow is innocent to a fault, Aqua hates violence, and Green is a cunning sneak who uses his status as the baby brother to manipulate his siblings. During yet another of White's attempts to get his siblings to train with him, their television begins broadcasting a signal from Buggler, who proclaims his goal to conquer the universe and shows that his army has taken control of the five planets of the Starry Sky Nebula; swearing that all other planets will soon follow. He offers a challenge to anyone who would defy him to fight his Five Dastardly Bombers. White immediately takes up the challenge and forces his siblings to come with him as he heads to the Starry Sky Nebula to face the Buggler army. Release Super Bomberman R was developed by Konami and HexaDrive, and several people involved in the game are former Hudson Soft staff who had worked in past Bomberman titles.

Biography She was initially arranged to become a maidservant of a lord's daughter, but instead became a palace woman. She used to serve Queen Inryeol of the Cheongju Han clan's brother-in-law, and the queen was the one who arranged her to enter the palace. Royal favorite She caught King Injo of Joseon eyes and became his favourite consort overnight; her rank also changed rapidly, from the lowest Sukwon to Sowon, Soyong (she is widely known as Lady Jo Soyong), Soui, and finally declared as a royal consort of the junior first rank, Gwi-in. No one could beat her in terms of receiving the king‚Äôs affection; both Queen Jangryeol of the Yangju Jo clan and Lady Jang Sukui failed to receive Injo‚Äôs love. Her personality was described as that of a sensual but cunning woman, and those who were in her bad book would not be safe in front of the king. Because of this, people inside the palace were very afraid of her. It was rumored that Lady Jo disturbed the relationship between Injo and Queen Jangryeol of the Yangju Jo clan, with the intention to tear them apart. Feud with the Crown Princess Another well-known fact about her was the hate she harbored towards the Yi Wang, Crown Prince Sohyeon ‚Äôs family, particularly Crown Princess Minhoe. Since the day she reached the rank of Soyong, she would badmouth them in front of Injo and it became a common thing for her to slander them with false accusations. Although there was no record of her involvement with Crown Prince Sohyeon‚Äôs death, her slanders did not stop after the prince passed away. Because of that, Crown Princess Minhoe suspected Lady Jo of poisoning her husband. Lady Jo accused the crown princess of attempting to poison Injo, leading to the princess‚Äô execution by poisoning. The acupuncturist who treated Prince Sohyeon before his death was Lee Hyung- ik, who was rumored to be in a relationship with Lady Jo's mother. There was even a record about this. Later life After Injo's death, she was discovered to be involved in an attempt to put a curse on Queen Jangryeol of the Yangju Jo clan and the queen's niece. Kim Ja-jeom was her accomplice and he was executed. King Hyojong decided to spare the life of Princess Hyomyeong, Lady Jo's daughter, since she was not involved in the incident. Lady Jo was sentenced to death by poisoning and her mother Han-ok, who was also an accomplice, died before she could receive her punishment. There were officials suggesting for Lady Jo to be stripped of her position as a royal consort but out of respect for his father, who treasured Lady Jo, King Hyojong did not go through with the idea and she remained as a consort of the junior first rank. She had a daughter and two sons with King Injo of Joseon. Family *Father: Jo Gi (1574 - ?)

History Ferguson was a farmer born in Hawick, Scotland, and emigrated in 1836 on what has been termed the \\"First Fleet of South Australia\\" on Governor Hindmarsh's flagship Buffalo. His wife, who was pregnant when they embarked, gave birth to their first child on board the Buffalo in South Australian waters. Ferguson was present at the Proclamation ceremony by the Old Gum Tree on 28 December 1836, and helped thatch the roof of the original Government House. Ferguson purchased two \\"city acres\\" in a block stretching between Hindley and Currie Streets, the eastern boundary of which later became a thoroughfare, named Rosina Street after Mrs. Ferguson. He also purchased an acre on Rundle Street where Adelaide Arcade now stands, and another, on which the Primrose Brewery later stood. He also owned property at Magill (or Makgill as it was once spelled). It was there he grew one of the colony's first wheat crops, before selling it to Dr. C. R. Penfold. He also purchased a part of section 251, Hundred of Adelaide, which he named \\"Roseville\\", again for his wife, and they lived there for around ten years. \\"Roseville\\" became the suburb Highgate. Ferguson later purchased Section 267 at Glen Osmond. This property was first owned by Capt. Berkeley, who sold it to William Sanders, who built a house and named it \\"Myrtle Bank\\", then sold to Capt. William Elder, brother of Sir Thomas Elder.

Sodium calcium edetate came into medical use in the United States in 1953. Chelation agent Sodium calcium edetate is in the chelating agent family of medication. It is a salt of edetate with two sodium and one calcium atoms. It works by binding to a number of heavy metals, which renders them almost inert and allows them to leave the body in the urine. Edetate disodium is a different formulation which does not have the same effects. Medical use Sodium calcium edetate's primarily use is to treat lead poisoning, for which it is an alternative to succimer. It is given by slow injection into a vein or into a muscle. For lead encephalopathy sodium calcium edetate is typically used together with dimercaprol. It may also be used to treat plutonium poisoning. It does not appear to be useful for poisoning by tetra-ethyl lead.  Side effects  Common side effects include pain at the site of injection. Other side effects may include kidney problems, diarrhea, fever, muscle pains, and low blood pressure. Benefits when needed in pregnancy are likely greater than the risks.  History  Sodium calcium edetate came into medical use in the United States in 1953. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.

It took place alongside a by-election in Copeland. Labour chose Gareth Snell, a member of Newcastle- under-Lyme Borough Council, to defend their seat. Paul Nuttall, elected leader of the UK Independence Party in November 2016, was his party's candidate. UKIP were expected to do well after coming second in 2015, and the very high level of support for Brexit in Stoke in the June 2016 referendum. Nuttall became embroiled in controversy when his account of being present at the 1989 Hillsborough disaster was disputed by those who knew him at the time. Snell was also criticised for historical Twitter posts he had made about women on television, Brexit and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. An independent candidate, Barbara Fielding-Morriss, was arrested during the election campaign for inciting racial hatred and imprisoned for the offence in 2018. Snell retained the seat for Labour with 37% of the vote, a slight decrease compared to 2015. The turnout of 38.2% was the lowest in the history of the constituency, which usually has a low turnout anyway.  Result   Background  The seat had been held by Labour since its creation for the 1950 general election, and by Tristram Hunt since 2010. The Liberal Democrats were second at the 2005 and 2010 elections, but the UK Independence Party (UKIP) came second in 2015. The constituency is set to be reshaped and renamed under the initial proposals of the Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies. The seat had a turnout of 49.9% in the 2015 general election, the lowest turnout in the country. The electorate is majority working class, with higher than average levels of unemployment. The constituency is entirely urban. In the 2016 EU Referendum, Stoke-on-Trent (the whole council area) voted heavily to Leave the European Union: at 69.4%, this was the highest percentage in the West Midlands region. As the constituency is not coterminous with any local authority, the exact result for the parliamentary seat is unknown. However Chris Hanretty, a Reader in Politics at the University of East Anglia, estimated using a demographic model that in Stoke Central, 65.0% of voters voted 'Leave'. According to figures released by Stoke-on-Trent City Council, over 2,500 new applications to vote had been received before the deadline for voter registration. This followed campaigns by the council and the Staffordshire University Students' Union to increase registration. The total number of eligible electors was 57,701, an increase of 4.3% on the figure when the election was called.  Candidates and parties  Labour On 16 January 2017, Jeremy Corbyn appointed Jack Dromey MP to run Labour's by-election campaign. The Labour shortlist for Stoke-on-Trent Central was confirmed as Councillor Alison Gardner, Dr Stephen Hitchin, Trudie McGuinness, and Councillor Gareth Snell. Hitchin withdrew from the contest prior to the hustings. Snell was selected as the Labour candidate on 25 January 2017. Snell is a member and former leader of Newcastle-under-Lyme Borough Council, and supported 'Remain' in the EU referendum. He did not support the re-election of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn during the 2016 leadership election. Snell's platform included policies of securing a deal for the city's ceramics industry from Brexit, attracting better-paid jobs to Stoke, and increasing the amount of affordable housing. UKIP On 21 January, UKIP leader Paul Nuttall MEP was confirmed as the party's candidate. He had previously stood unsuccessfully for parliament four times. Conservatives On 25 January the Conservatives selected Jack Brereton, councillor for the ward of Baddeley Green, Milton & Norton, as their candidate. Brereton is a member of the Stoke-on-Trent City Council cabinet and is a school governor. Two days before Brereton's selection, an article in The Huffington Post quoted unnamed Conservative Party sources saying that the by-election in Stoke would be given lower priority than the Copeland by-election on the same day, which the party thought they had a better chance of winning. Former Conservative minister Esther McVey had previously suggested that UKIP was significantly better placed to win the Stoke by-election than the Conservatives. Brereton's platform included securing local investment for Stoke, a crackdown on street drinking and anti- social behaviour, and placing controls on the number of EU migrants. He would become the MP for the neighbouring constituency of Stoke-on-Trent South at the general election held four months later. Liberal Democrats Dr Zulfiqar Ali, a National Health Service consultant who lives in Stoke, was the Liberal Democrat candidate. He contested the seat in 2015 and Stoke-on-Trent South in 2010. Others Several candidates had policies related to aiding Stoke's ceramics industry On 31 January it was announced that Adam Colclough, who had stood in two council elections, would be standing for the Green Party. Independent candidate Barbara Fielding-Morriss (standing under the name Barbara Fielding) is the registered leader of the party \\"Abolish Magna Carta, Reinstate Monarchy\\" and is recorded as a vexatious litigant. She is a self- declared white supremacist and anti-Semite. The Incredible Flying Brick stood as a candidate for the Official Monster Raving Loony Party. His policies included abolishing gravity and powering trains on gravy. British National Party candidate David Furness stood for the party in the London Mayoral election in 2016, finishing tenth with 13,325 votes (0.5%). He had also contested two parliamentary by-elections: Feltham and Heston in 2011 and Batley and Spen in 2016, polling 540 (2.3%) and 548 votes (2.7%) respectively. The Christian Peoples Alliance chose Godfrey Davies, a retired Merchant Navy deck officer from Congleton, Cheshire. Davies, whose party is pro-Brexit, planned to revive Stoke's ceramics industry, and stood for conservative positions on marriage and abortion. Mohammed Akram ran as an independent, against the privatisation of the NHS, in favour of new council housing and a Brexit deal protecting migrants.  Campaign  Early in the campaign, Labour candidate Gareth Snell attacked both UKIP and the Conservatives for their stance on NHS funding, while the Conservative, Brereton, raised Snell's opposition to Brexit in his acceptance speech as Conservative candidate. On 3 February, it was reported by The Guardian that the Labour Party was exploring an agreement with the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party which would involve these parties deprioritising their respective campaigns in this by- election in order to assist Labour in defeating UKIP. The report also suggested that Liberal Democrat and Green candidates could withdraw, although under electoral law the deadline for formal withdrawals has passed and the candidates would remain on the ballot. On 4 February, a Labour spokesman denied this report when asked by The Independent. All candidates, bar Nuttall, Fielding and Akram, took part in personal interviews for ITV News. Staffordshire University hosted a debate on 14 February, attended by all candidates bar Fielding and Akram, and attended by around 200 members of the public. The university's Professor of Journalism and Politics, Mick Temple, called it \\"one of the most important political elections in British political history\\". The NHS was a key topic of debate: Nuttall called for investment in healthcare instead of \\"vanity projects\\" like High Speed 2, Snell spoke of \\"stability\\" for EU-national NHS workers after Brexit, and Furness said that \\"third world\\" doctors and nurses were more needed in their countries of origin. A major storm, named Doris, hit the constituency on polling day, which some commentators suggested would suppress turnout. Controversies Paul Nuttall On 1 February, it was reported that nomination papers submitted by UKIP candidate Paul Nuttall declared he was living in a house in Stoke that he had not moved into at the time they were filed, potentially an offence under the Representation of the People Act 1983. A spokesman for the UKIP campaign stated that the house had been rented by the party prior to the close of nominations and that Nuttall would be moving in that day. On 11 February, Nuttall moved out of the house following attempted break-ins and hate mail, and moved to another property in the Stoke Central constituency. Nuttall became embroiled in controversy when his account of being present at the Hillsborough disaster was disputed On 11 February, Nuttall was accused of lying about his claims to have been present at the Hillsborough disaster when he was 12. A former teacher at his school denied he was among pupils present. The Hillsborough Families Support Group said they were surprised Nuttall had never offered to support their campaigns, while people who had known Nuttall at the time of the disaster and candidates he had previously stood against said they had no recollection of him mentioning it. UKIP released statements from Nuttall's father and a long-time friend who now works for the party stating that he had been at Hillsborough. Nuttall himself said that those who suggested he was not at the ground were the \\"scum of the earth\\" but declined to confirm whether he had given a statement to the police (as everyone at the ground on the day of the disaster has been asked to). A UKIP statement said that the claims were \\"a new low for the Labour party and its associates\\". Nuttall was later challenged on a radio show about past UKIP press releases that he had lost \\"close personal friends\\" in the disaster: he admitted this was not true, saying \\"someone he knew\\" had died, and said that the press releases had not \\"come from him\\". A UKIP press officer subsequently took responsibility and offered to resign, but the resignation was not accepted by Nuttall. Two UKIP branch chairs resigned in response to Nuttall's actions and comments by UKIP donor Arron Banks on the subject. On 20 February, Nuttall gave a witness statement to police officers from Operation Resolve, who are investigating the causes of the Hillsborough disaster and whether there is any criminal culpability on the part of individuals or organisations. Other Snell was criticised for historical Twitter posts that he made about the appearance and moral character of several women on television, and apologised publicly. Among his other tweets were one where he called Brexit a \\"massive pile of shit\\", and Labour leader Corbyn an \\"IRA supporting friend of Hamas career politician\\". He responded by saying that despite his opposition to Brexit, he would not aim to overturn it and would look for the best deal for Stoke, and said that his comments on Corbyn were \\"to demonstrate the absurdity of the hyperbole\\". UKIP Immigration spokesman John Bickley retweeted an Islamophobic cartoon saying \\"If you want a jihadi for a neighbour, vote Labour\\", a variation on an anti-black slogan from the notorious election campaign in Smethwick in 1964. He apologised for the racist origin of the phrase but not for the anti-Muslim content that he had shared. Independent Barbara Fielding was arrested under Section 19 of the Public Order Act 1986, i.e. an offence to publish or distribute written material which may stir up racial hatred, because of material published on her website. Her posts had included praise for Adolf Hitler, and compared asylum seekers to termites. In June 2018, she was found guilty on three charges and not guilty of the fourth. On 3 October 2018 she was sentenced to twelve months imprisonment. On 16 February, it was revealed that Muslim residents had received text messages urging them to vote tactically and suggesting they will have to \\"answer for this in the Grave and on the Final day\\" for voting for a party other than Labour. The Liberal Democrats, whose candidate is Muslim, condemned the move, and called on Labour to apologise. The Lib Dems later reported the incident to Staffordshire Police, as the incident may breach laws on undue spiritual influence. Automated Twitter accounts, which usually posted pro-Russia propaganda, posted anti-UKIP and pro-Labour messages in the run-up to the by- election. A UKIP spokesman said that he was not concerned by the posts, nor did he believe they had been directed by President Vladimir Putin. Reaction The turnout of 38.2% was the lowest in the constituency's history, which has been one of markedly low turnouts. After he was announced as the victor, Snell said that the people of Stoke had chosen the \\"politics of hope\\" over the \\"politics of fear\\". Labour MP Jack Dromey said that the party had to retain \\"humility\\" while it remained in opposition. The result was widely described in the media as poor for UKIP, as they did not capitalise on their second place in 2015, Labour's poor standing in opinion polls, and the high support in the constituency for Brexit. UKIP's campaign was criticised by former leader Nigel Farage, who said that Nuttall should have courted Conservative voters with rhetoric about immigration rather than look to gain votes from Labour. Major donor Arron Banks was critical of Nuttall for not expelling former Conservatives Douglas Carswell and Suzanne Evans from UKIP, saying that the failure at Stoke had proven that the party was not gaining votes from Conservatives; he threatened to withdraw funding unless he was made chairman to expel them himself. Carswell and Banks both left the party at the end of March. In April 2020, Novara Media's Aaron Bastani claimed that members of Labour's senior management team (SMT), including the former general secretary Iain McNicol, actively attempted to get Labour to lose this by- election in the hope that such a defeat would remove Corbyn as leader.  2015 result   See also  *List of United Kingdom by-elections (2010‚Äìpresent) *Opinion polling for the next United Kingdom general election  References  2017 elections in the United Kingdom 2017 in England By-elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom in Staffordshire constituencies History of Stoke-on-Trent February 2017 events in the United Kingdom 21st century in Staffordshire ","title":"2017 Stoke-on-Trent Central by-election"},{"id":"52855919","text":"Rome Done Lightly is George Adamson's 1972 \\"light-hearted romp\\"Chatto & Windus advertisement in The Times, 29 June 1972, p. 11, issue 58517. in words and drawings through the Eternal City.

Not Built in a Day: 4 Rome drawings (Punch, vol. 250, no. 6539, 5 January 1966, pp. 16‚Äì17). Critical reception The Economist praised the artist's skill as a cartoonist: \\"Familiarity breeds caricature: it is difficult to cartoon the unfamiliar. Mr Adamson has managed beautifully, with the minimum of tedious explanation and the maximum of careful drawing . . .\\"The Economist, vol. 242, 29 January 1972, p. 63, issue 6701. Cecil Roberts writing in Books and Bookmen touched upon a paradox underlying much of Adamson's work: \\"I wish [Rome] wasn't done so lightly. I am distressed to see so superb an artist put on cap and bells when illustrating the Roman scene.\\"Cecil Roberts concluded with the remark: \\"I would like Mr Adamson to go again to Rome not so lightly, and reveal what a splendid artist he is, without the tongue in his cheek.\\" Books and Bookmen, vol. 17, no. 6, issue no. 198, March 1972, p. 68. In his review Roberts alludes to the colossal statue of Moses standing above four lions spouting water shown in one of Adamson's drawings. He claims that Adamson's text is erroneous and that no such artist as Bresciano existed. Rather it is the work of Prospero da Brescia. See, however, \\"The Discourse of failure in seventeenth-century Rome: Prospero Bresciano's 'Moses'\\", Steven F. Ostrow, The Art Bulletin, Vol. 88, No. 2 (June, 2006), pp. 267‚Äì91.

A former professor of electrical engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, he is known for his contributions in the fields of power stability, power grids, large scale power system analysis, system security and optimal control of nuclear reactors and he has published 8 books and several articles. Pai is the first India born scientist to be awarded a PhD in Electrical Engineering from the University of California, Berkeley. Pai is an IEEE Life Fellow and is an elected fellow of the Indian National Science Academy, Indian Academy of Sciences, and Indian National Academy of Engineers and an elected and life fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards for his contributions to Engineering Sciences in 1974.  Biography  M. A. Pai. born on 5 October 1931 in the south Indian state of Karnataka, did his graduate studies in electrical engineering at the University of Madras and after completing the course in 1953, started his career as an electrical engineer at the Electric Supply Department of Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport, then known as Bombay Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) Undertaking. After a service of 4 years, he moved to the US in 1957 where he completed his master's degree in electrical engineering (MS) at University of California, Berkeley in 1958 and continued at the institution to secure a PhD in 1961. Subsequently, he joined the university as an assistant professor at University of California, Berkeley (1961‚Äì62) before taking up Professorship at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1962. At UCLA, he had the opportunity to work with Eliahu I. Jury, a Rufus Oldenburger laureate on discrete time systems, and in 1963 he returned to India to join the Electrical Engineering department of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur as an assistant professor. He served the institute till 1981 during which period he held the positions of an associate professor from 1966 to 1969 and a professor thereafter till he went back to the US as a visiting professor at University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign in 1981. He also had a stint as a consultant to the Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited from 1971 to 1979. After two years of service as a visiting faculty at Illinois, he became a regular professor in 1983 and served out his academic career to superannuate in 2003. In between, he also served as a visiting professor at the Memorial University of Newfoundland and Iowa State University and visited India on a CSIR-UNDP program at Central Power Research Institute. Post-retirement, Illinois University made him an emeritus professor. He also serves as a consultant to Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, advising them on Model Reduction and Dynamic Security of Power System.  Legacy  Pai's early researches were based on power system stability, security and model reduction and his work on Model Reduction of Large-Scale Power Systems has been reported to be of significance to field of power systems. He is known to have introduced Lyapunov's method in researches on power system stability and energy functions. Introduction of computer applications in power systems is another of his contributions and a power system software he has developed is in use with several power distribution networks. Later, he worked on Smart Grid, Microgrid and Renewable Energy and how they could be integrated into the main electrical grid of a power system; earlier, at IIT Kanpur, he encouraged research on Control and Power. He has also contributed in the field of industrial consultancy and has served as a member of the editorial boards of Power and Energy series of Springer. In 1963, Pai was selected to join IIT Kanpur as one of the earliest member of the Electrical Engineering faculty. Under the guidance of economist John Kenneth Galbraith, IIT Kanpur became the first institute in India to offer Computer science education. The earliest computer courses were started at IIT Kanpur in August 1963 on an IBM 1620 system, which was flown from Princeton to Kanpur. The initiative for computer education came from the Electrical engineering department. An intense outreach program in Computer Education was established during his time at IIT Kanpur. It was during his years at IIT Kanpur, Pai published his first book, Computer Techniques in Power System Analysis. His second book, Power System Stability: Analysis by the Direct Method of Lyapunov, was also published before he moved to US in 1981. This was followed by five more authored books, Com Tech In Power Sys Ana, Power System Dynamics and Stability, Power Circuits and Electromechanics, Energy Function Analysis for Power System Stability and Small Signal Analysis of Integrated Power Systems, the last one published in 2016. In between, he co-edited an Oxford University Press festschrift on Homi J. Bhabha titled Homi Bhabha and the Computer Revolution, which was featured in the Indian edition of MIT Technology Review in May/June 2011. He has also contributed chapters to books published by others and has authored over 125 peer-reviewed articles; the online article repository of Indian Academy of Sciences has listed 107 of them. He is reported to have helped organize two symposia of International Federation of Automatic Control in India and has delivered keynote or invited speeches at several science seminars in India and abroad including the Seminar on Voltage Instability in Power Network organized by the Delhi chapter of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in 1991.

The trio was well received at its premiere in Paris, with the composer at the piano. It has been performed and recorded frequently since. Critics have praised the work's depth of feeling, noting touches of Mozartian flavour and echoes of other composers' styles. It is regarded as the first major chamber work by Poulenc.  Background and first performance  By 1924 the 25-year-old Poulenc had become fairly well known in France, and to some extent elsewhere. First as a member of Les Six around the start of the decade, and then with his music for the ballet Les biches in 1924, he had established himself as a rising young composer.Hell (1959), pp. 17‚Äì21 and 28 He had composed several chamber works, including the Sonata for clarinet and bassoon and the Sonata for horn, trumpet and trombone (both 1922),Nichols, p. 348 and he began work on a trio for oboe, bassoon and piano in May 1924. He was a slow and painstaking composer, and the piece took him two years to complete.Nichols, p. 62 Finally he retreated to a hotel in Cannes to isolate himself from family and friends while he finished the work. While there he met Igor Stravinsky who gave him some good advice (\\"quelques bons conseils\\") that helped him with the final version of the first movement of the new piece.Car√©, pp. 11‚Äì12 Poulenc dedicated the Trio to Manuel de Falla, who was delighted with the work and promised to organise and take part in a performance in Spain as soon as possible.Car√©, p. 12 The first performance of the Trio was given at the Salle des Agriculteurs in Paris on 2 May 1926 in a concert at which two other Poulenc works, Napoli and Chansons gaillardes, were also premiered.Nichols, p. 71 The work was given again the following day.\\"Concerts de la Revue Musicale\\", Le M√©nestrel, 14 May 1926, p. 223 The players were Roger Lamorlette (oboe), Gustave Dh√©rin (bassoon) and the composer (piano).Schmidt, p. 149  Music  The Trio is in three movements ‚Äì Presto, Andante and Rondo. The playing time is about 14 minutes. Like several of the composers whom Poulenc admired and who influenced him, he was unattracted to traditional sonata form with exposition and development of themes. He preferred what he called an \\"episodic\\" style, in which a theme is presented with no development and is followed by a contrasting theme, similarly treated.Nichols, p. 64 Nevertheless, many years after the work was written, Poulenc told Claude Rostand: In a 1998 study of Poulenc, Keith Daniel suggests that this ex post facto analysis by Poulenc was to some extent myth- making ‚Äì something he was given to. Roger Nichols (2020) concurs and considers the most striking feature of the Trio is its depth of feeling, \\"especially in the central Andante where, in his favourite B flat major and over a continuously pulsing quaver movement, he gives full rein to his lyrical gifts\\".Nichols, p. 65 Poulenc's biographer Henri Hell comments that several themes recall Mozart, notably the first bars of the Andante.Hell (1978), p. 82  I: Presto  Before the presto begins there is a slow (‚ô© = 76) 15-bar introduction in time. First, the piano is heard in a series of bare chords; the bassoon joins in the fourth bar and the oboe in the eighth. The analyst Claude Car√© likens the introduction to \\"a very grand centuries-old portico\\", Wilfrid Mellers calls it \\"quasi-Lullian\\"Mellers, p. 14 and both Hell and Nichols find clear echoes of the ceremonious French overture and \\"the Versailles of Louis XIV\\".Hell (1978), p. 83; and Nichols, p. 64 Mellers finds \\"a Stravinskian starkness\\" in the introduction, and Hell comments that one can never be sure whether its tone is grave or wry.Mellers, 14; and Hell (1959), p. 33 The presto (minim =104) begins with a classically double-dotted theme for the bassoon in B-flat minor, echoed by the oboe, a semitone higher. A new theme in F minor ‚Äì which in a traditional sonata form movement might be the second subject ‚Äì is succeeded by a middle section at half speed, in which Mellers hears the influence of Gluck. The lively opening theme of the presto returns to round off the movement. II: Andante  The slow movement, marked \\"Andante con moto\\" (‚ô™= 84), is \\"melodically vocal in idiom and pianistically luxuriant\\" (Mellers). The opening theme, in B-flat major is a gentle tune. There are further echoes of Gluck, with a quotation from his \\"Dance of the Blessed Spirits\\".Mellers, p. 15 The oboe has a melody of \\"melancholy grace\\".Hell (1978), p. 83 The mood becomes less idyllic towards the end of the movement: in Mellers's words, \\"the delights of pastoral F major [become] shadowed with chromatics\\", and the final chord is in F minor, a key associated with dirges. III: Rondo  The last movement (‚ô©. = 138‚Äì144) is marked \\"tr√®s vif\\" ‚Äì very lively. The music maintains what Car√© calls a frenzy of movement (\\"fr√©n√©sie du mouvement\\"),Car√©, p. 14 the piano playing without a single bar's rest, and the \\"ironic voice\\" of the oboe contrasting with the bassoon.Hell (1978), p. 84 The impetus continues unflaggingly throughout: Poulenc instructs the players not to slow down in the closing bars (\\"sans ralentir\\"). Mellers comments that this finale has affinities with a baroque French gigue, an Offenbach galop, and ‚Äì \\"in the tight Stravinskian coda ‚Äì the acerbity of post-war Paris\\".  Reception  Le M√©nestrel said after the second performance: Hell calls the Trio the composer's first major achievement in the sphere of chamber music,Hell (1959), p. 32 and praises \\"the perfect coherence of its construction\\" and its \\"innate equilibrium\\". Poulenc was famously self-critical,Deeter and Peavler, p. 3; and Poulenc and Southon, p. 241 but looking back in the 1950s he said \\"I'm rather fond of my Trio because it sounds clear, and it is well balanced.\\" He also noted with satisfaction that the energetic finale was always followed by sustained applause (\\"applaudissements nourris\\"). In the last year of his life, after hearing a performance, he wrote that the work \\"retained an extraordinary fresh force and fantastic individuality\\". Mellers echoed Poulenc's words, writing that thirty years later the music still retained those qualities; \\"this music is tonic to ageing minds and senses\\". Recordings Lamorlee, Dh√©rin and the composer recorded the work for French Columbia in 1928 ‚Äì one of Poulenc's earliest records. When it was reissued on CD, Robert Layton wrote in Gramophone, \\"The special tang of the two French wind players in the engaging Trio of 1926 (recorded two years later) is inimitable; a rather thin, papery sound but like everything here very characterful\\".Layton, Robert. \\"Honegger/Poulenc Perform their own works\\", Gramophone, June 1994 A later recording (1957) with the composer as pianist features Pierre Pierlot (oboe) and Maurice Allard (bassoon). Reviewing it in 1988, Will Crutchfield wrote in The New York Times, \\"Unfortunately, the trio was recorded with bad balance and aggressively close miking, but the flavor (tart Mozart pastiche juxtaposed with popular song) comes through\\".Crutchfield, Will. \\"Recordings; A Wellspring From Poulenc's Song Legacy\\", The New York Times, 17 January 1988 There have been numerous recordings of the trio by other players. Among them are those by Pascal Rog√© (piano), Maurice Bourgue (oboe) and Amaury Wallez (bassoon);Decca 4757097 James Levine, Hansj√∂rg Schellenberger and Milan Turkoviƒá;DG 4276392 Julius Drake, Nicholas Daniel and Rachel Gough;Cala CACD1018 √âric Le Sage, Fran√ßois Leleux and Gilbert Audin;RCA 88985321992 the Melos Ensemble;Warner Classics 9185142 the Nash Ensemble; Hyperion CDA67255/6 Fibonacci Sequence;Deux-Elles DXL1121 and the Poulenc Trio.

Saint Ephrem Church in Paris, Syrian Catholic Church The Ordinariate for Eastern (Rite) Catholics in France (or France of the Eastern Rite) (French: Ordinariat des catholiques de rite oriental r√©sidant en France) is a Catholic Ordinariate for Eastern Catholic faithful (pseudo-diocesan jurisdiction within a Latin Church territory), jointly for Eastern Catholics in various rites and languages of particular churches sui iuris without proper jurisdiction there. It is exempt, i.e. immediately subject to the Holy See, and depends directly on its Roman Congregation for the Oriental Churches.  History  Since 1922 existed in the archdiocese of Paris a diocesan administration for the strangers, which was placed under the authority of an auxiliary bishop. The high number of Middle Eastern immigrants had imposed on the archbishop, in December 1953, the creation of 8 eastern parishes in Paris. The question, however, did not concern only the French capital, but the entire national territory; in fact, according to the 1954 census, approximately 50,000 Catholics belonging to the various Eastern rites resided permanently in France.books.google.it[Kaptijn, op. cit., p. 255.] At the beginning of 1954, the Episcopal commission for foreigners elaborated a report on the situation of the Orientals in France and on the opportunity to create a \\"coordination\\" between them.[Kaptijn, op. cit., pp. 253-254.] These considerations prompted the Holy See to erect the ordinariate for the faithful of the Eastern rite on July 27, 1954 with the decree Nobilis Galliae Natio of the Congregation for the Eastern Churches, which implemented an ex audientia decision of the Pope Pius XII of June 16.[The Pontifical Yearbook reports the date of the ordination of the ordinariate of 16 June and not that of the decree] The ordinary office is entrusted to the archbishop pro tempore of Paris, with the right to appoint one or more vicars general for the eastern faithful.[Kaptijn, op. cit., p. 255.] The ordinariate lost its jurisdiction over three Eastern Catholic rite-specific particular churches sui iuris to the following jurisdictions directly dependent on their particular chiefs, but not part of any ecclesiastical province: * Armenian Catholic Eparchy of Sainte-Croix-de- Paris, in and for France, immediately subject to the Patriarch of Cilicia (since 22 July 1960 an apostolic exarchate and 30 June 1986 an eparchy) * Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Saint Vladimir the Great of Paris (since 22 July 1960 an apostolic exarchate and 19 January 2013 an eparchy) directly subject to the Major Archbishop, for France, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland. * Maronite Eparchy of Notre-Dame du Liban de Paris, immediately subject to the Patriarch of Antioch (since 21 July 2012 an eparchy).  Territory and statistics  The Ordinariate has jurisdiction over the faithful of the Eastern rites who live on French territory, with the exception of those who have their own ordinary, as Armenians, Ukrainians and Maronites. Its seat is located in Paris and its ordinary is the Metropolitan Archbishop of national capital Paris, and its incumbents were all created Cardinals.

YM BioSciences also had several preclinical programs underway with candidates from its library of compounds identified through internal research conducted at YM BioSciences Australia. The company also advanced other clinical-stage products, including Nimotuzumab, an EGFR-targeting monoclonal antibody, and CYT997, a vascular disrupting agent (VDA). The company was listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange. YM BioSciences was the first company from any major-market country to enter into a relationship with the Cuban Government for the development of a number of that country's biopharmaceuticals, with first licenses concluding in 1995. In 1994, the company created a joint venture with Centro de Inmunolog√≠a Molecular (CCIMAB) in Cuba called CIMYM BioSciences. The joint venture developed the Nimotuzumab drug.

YM BioSciences received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for Nimotuzumab in 2004 and received a number of single-patient IND clearances starting in 2005. After receiving approval from the Office of Foreign Asset Control in March 200, the first patient was treated at Doernbecher Children's Hospital of Oregon Health and Science University for inoperable, recurrent, diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. That approval was extended to unlimited clinical use. In August 2007, YM BioSciences received clearance from the FDA to conduct a Phase II trial. That trial was conducted at seven leading cancer institutes across the United States, including Memorial Sloan-Kettering, M.D. Anderson, Johns Hopkins, University of Florida, Vanderbilt Children's Hospital, Children's Hospital/University of Colorado and NYU Medical Center. This was the first IND in history ever cleared by the United States FDA for clinical trials with Cuban-origin biopharmaceuticals and certainly the first Orphan Drug designation. In 2010, after investing many years of lobbying the United States State Department, and, specifically, as a consequence of the assistance from Senators John Kerry, Christopher Dodd and Richard Lugar, YM was cleared by the Office of Foreign Assets Control to import Nimotuzumab for unlimited clinical development and was cleared by the FDA for Phase II trials in both Non-Small Cell Lung cancer and Brain Metastases from NSCLC. In Canada, in June 2007, the company received clearance from Health Canada to begin a Phase II trial of nimotuzumab in colorectal cancer patients who had not responded to previous treatments.

History  The village of Kunreuth had probably been mentioned in the founding document (Gr√ºndungsbuch) of the church of St. James at Bamberg which dates to 1109. Lords of Kunreuth are first recorded in 1308. What is unclear is whether there was already a castle in existence at that time. The first record of a castle dates to 1409. At that time, the castle was a fief of the Bishopric of Bamberg, owned by the lords of Egloffstein. In 1420 the castle was conquered and plundered during a feud between Margrave Frederick I of Brandenburg and Duke Louis VII of Bavaria-Ingolstadt. In 1525, during the Peasants' War the castle was destroyed. It was immediately rebuilt by the lords of Egloffstein. In 1553 the castle was wrecked again: during the Second Margrave War by Margrave Albert Alcibiades. Despite the promise of free passage, the troops of the garrison were hanged on the trees around the castle. From 1558 the castle, now a Ganerbenburg of the House of Egloffstein, was rebuilt as a schloss, whilst largely retaining its military character. During the Thirty Years' War the schloss suffered severe damage during its frequent use for billeting soldiers. This damage was repaired over time. The schloss is still owned by the counts and freiherren \\"von und zu Egloffstein\\", who have used it to house their family archives.  Description  The former water castle ‚Äì some of the moats were laid dry in 1827 ‚Äì has a rectangular plan. It consists primarily of a west and a south wing. The south wing probably houses the oldest parts of the castle, which go back to the 14th century. The west wing was given its present appearance mainly in the period from 1611 to 1613. The gateway on the east side of the schloss was built in 1624. In 1746 the drawbridge was replaced by a stone bridge. On the north side is a wall with buttresses. Until its destruction in the Second Margrave War the so-called rear cabinet (Kemenate) was located here. In the forecourt of the schloss is a monument to the first Count of Egloffstein, Count Albert Dietrich Godfrey of Egloffstein.

Early life  Ross Ian McKibbin was born in Sydney, Australia, in January 1942, the son of Arnold Walter McKibbin, a teacher, and his wife, Nance Lilian, daughter of Clarence Spence, a bank manager from Bega. McKibbin's father's family emigrated from Northern Ireland in the 1860s. His paternal grandfather was the secretary to the vice- chancellor of Sydney University and the family were staunchly Protestant. When Arthur McKibbin was demobilised from the RAAF after World War II, he took up teaching at North Sydney Boys' High School until 1951, when the family relocated to Forbes, a rural township in New South Wales; five years later, they moved to Orange, where McKibbin completed his schooling.\\"McKibbin, Dr Ross Ian\\", Who's Who 2017 (online edition), Oxford University Press, 2016. Retrieved 4 February 2017. In 1959, he enrolled at Sydney University, around the same time that his father was offered a bureaucratic post in the city's Education Department. At university, he involved himself in the Labour Club, wrote a dissertation on the origins of Australian nationalism and received a university prize for his fourth-year examination results. Influenced by a tutor, Ernest Bramsted, and his own Labour politics, McKibbin became interested in the history of the British Labour Party which, in contrast to its Australian counterpart, then embraced a certain left-wing idealism. Keen to access British archives, he completed his doctorate on the party's early history under the supervision of Pat Thompson at St Antony's College, Oxford, between 1964 and 1967.

P. 92 Life Rabiu was born to the family of Muhammadu Rabiu Dan Tinki, a Quranic preacher from the Bichi area of Kano State who led his own Quranic school. From 1936 to 1942, Rabiu attended his father's school learning the Quran and Arabic. He then moved to Maiduguri, Borno for further Islamic education. After spending four years in Maiduguri, he returned to Kano prepared to be an Islamic scholar. In 1949, Rabiu was an independent teacher of Arabic and the Quran who had among his audience Ibrahim Musa Gashash. In the early 1950s while still a teacher, Rabiu began to engage in private enterprise and established Isyaku Rabiu & Sons in 1952. Originally the firm acted as an agent of UAC and was trading in sewing machines, religious books and bicycles. In 1958, the firm had a breakthrough when Kaduna Textile Limited was established and it became one of the early distributors. Rabiu emerged as the leading distributor of the company in Northern Nigeria. In 1963, he joined a consortium of businessmen from Kano who came together to form the Kano Merchants Trading Company. The establishments continued to survive withstanding competition from foreign products. In 1970, he established a suit and packing factory.

The firm was a joint venture with Lebanese investors. In 1972, he formed the Bagauda Textile Mill, manufacturing woven cloths for uniforms. Rabiu then established a series of ventures in different segments of the economy including frozen food service, real estate, sugar and a motor vehicle and parts distribution company specialized in Daihatsu products.

He was best known for his books on salmon fishing. Early years Arthur Oglesby was born in Scarborough in December 1923, before the family moved to York when he was 2 years old. In his autobiography Reeling In, he described his Yorkshire childhood as \\"semi-Victorian\\".Reeling In by Arthur Oglesby, published by The Crowood Press, 1988 As a boy he enjoyed a rural life, where he was first introduced to fishing. Leaving school at 16 years, he became an apprentice chemist for the family manufacturing pharmaceuticals business, Harvey Scruton, York (his grandfather, a chemist, had invented Nurse Harvey's Gripe Water, as a remedy for colic in infants). At the age of 18 years, Oglesby joined the Black Watch regiment, and saw action in Northern France during the Second World War. He was wounded in Normandy in the thigh and chest, just a few weeks after surviving the D-Day landings in June 1944. He was latterly stationed in Gibraltar from 1945‚Äì7 and left the Army as a Captain, returning to Yorkshire to help run the family business. Career When he was not working in his family business, Oglesby spent as much time as he could on his hobbies of fishing, shooting and photography. In 1950 he began to combine these hobbies by taking photos of angling subjects. His first commission was for ICI where he sold some transparencies for their calendar. He then began to submit articles for magazines such as The Field, Creel and Angling, Shooting Times, Amateur Photographer and the American Field & Stream, becoming their European editor. Arthur Oglesby catching an Atlantic salmon on the Vosso in Norway Oglesby became the editor of Anglers Annual for three years during the mid- Sixties, for two decades was a weekly contributor to Shooting Times, and wrote regularly for Trout & Salmon. His photographic archive held more than 30,000 images. Oglesby first visited the River Spey in 1957 with his mentor Eric Horsfall Turner and met up with Captain T L 'Tommy' Edwards, who was running some of the first-ever fishing courses and took him on as an assistant instructor. On Edwards' death in 1968, he took over the courses on Speyside teaching guests to perfect their Salmon fishing and Spey casting for over 30 years. From 1968 onward, Oglesby took a back seat in the running of the family business, moved to Harrogate and concentrated on making a career from angling. In 1969 he helped to found the Association of Professional Game Angling Instructors and was its chairman for many yearsRosenbauer, Tom 'The Orvis Encyclopedia of Fly Fishing' p183, published by Thomas Nelson, Inc 2010 Oglesby was a prolific writer, with a total of nine books to his own pen or co-authored. His first was in 1971 titled Salmon and his most famous book was Fly Fishing for Salmon & Sea Trout, written in 1986. Oglesby was most renowned for catching two huge Atlantic salmon on the Bolstrad beat of the Vosso river in Norway including one in 1973, his largest ever fish weighing 49 1/2lb. He caught some of the largest catches of his generation, and over the course of his career, he landed over 2,500 Atlantic salmon. Oglesby ran the casting demonstrations at the annual CLA Game Fair and in 1999 he was awarded their Lifetime Achievement Award. For many years, Oglesby led fishing parties to Iceland, Alaska, Norway and Russia, usually in the company of his second wife Grace, herself an accomplished angler. He continued to run the fishing school at Grantown-on-Spey in Scotland during the spring weeks and late summer each year, teaching hundreds of people to perfect the art of salmon fishing. In December 2000, at the age of 76, Oglesby died suddenly, from an undiagnosed infection, after heart surgery a few months earlier. Family Arthur Oglesby was married twice, firstly to Mary in 1947 (divorced 1968) and secondly to Grace in 1969. He was survived by his second wife Grace, two boys from his first marriage Peter & John, and two boys from his second marriage Paul & Mark. Legacy In 2001 the CLA Game Fair commissioned Ian Greensitt to produce a bronze salmon trophy for the Arthur Oglesby Award. This was awarded annually to someone who has made a lifetime contribution to the sport of fishing and who has made a particular impact in the last year.

In 1983 he was appointed as Head of the French Army. Two years later he reached the normal French army retirement age, but after the sinking of the Rainbow Warrior caused Admiral Pierre Lacoste to lose the position, Imbot took over as head of Overseas Intelligence (\\"Direction g√©n√©rale de la s√©curit√© ext√©rieure\\" / DGSE). Life Ren√© Imbot was born into a military family in Roussillon, Vaucluse. When he was just 16 he joined the resistance Maquillards in the Allier department in central France. By that time he had already attended the military preparatory academy at √âpinal and the Prytan√©e National Militaire, which he left in 1941. In September 1944 he joined the \\"marche de la Corr√®ze\\" regiment and took part in the liberation struggle in the Belfort region. Once the fighting was over he passed the entrance exam for the prestigious Saint Cyr special military academy, from which he later progressed to the Cherchell military academy in Algeria. He first posting as an officer came in 1946 when he was given command of the 13th Demi-Brigade of the Foreign Legion in Indochina. He served two terms. In January 1952 he was promoted to the rank of captain and assigned to the 4th Infantry Regiment of the Foreign Legion in Morocco, where he remained till 1954. He then undertook Staff college training before returning to Morocco, initially with the divisional staff at Meknes and then in command of the 26th Infantry Division at Fez. In 1958 he went off to undertake a further training at the United States Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas (USA). Returning in 1959 he was assigned to NATO (Atomic Planning Section) and sent to Heidelberg for the three years 1959-1962. Here he was promoted to Battalion leader. In 1964 Imbot emerged from a further training period at the War College as a major and took command as a Group Company Commander of the 51st Motorised Infantry Regiment based at Beauvais. He was promoted again in April 1966, now becoming a Lieutenant colonel, and was assigned to the military personnel department of the French Army (DPMAT). In 1969, now a Colonel, he took command of the 35th Mechanised Infantry Regiment at Belfort. When that command came to an end he returned to the DPMAT as Chief of the Infantry Office. In 1974 he took command of the First Mechanised Brigade at Saarburg in West Germany. The next year he was promoted to Brigadier general and the next year he took commande of the Infantry Academy at Montpelier. Made a Divisional general in 1978, on 15 September 1979 he was appointed deputy military governor of Paris, taking on command of the 3rd Army Corps and of the 1st Military Region. In October 1980 he took over as director of personnel for the land army. He was made Army corps general in 1980, and promoted to General in March 1983. Later that year the Minister of Defence, Charles Hernu, appointed Ren√© Imbot Head of the Army (\\"Chef d'√©tat-major de l'Arm√©e de terre\\" / CEMAT). Together, Hernu and Imbot created the Rapid Action Force (\\"force d'action rapide \\" / FAR), designed for rapid intervention in Europe and overseas. He was succeeded in 1985 by Maurice Schmitt. He was now appointed Overseas Intelligence (\\"Direction g√©n√©rale de la s√©curit√© ext√©rieure\\" / DGSE) by President Mitterrand. The appointment came amidst widesparead calls for reform of the service in the wake of the Rainbow Warrior affair which had triggered the resignation of his predecessor in the role, Pierre Lacoste. Imbot reorganised and modernised the DGSE, also reinstating the 11th Shock Parachute Regiment which had been dissolved back in 1963. The Rainbow Warrior affair was viewed by the political establishment as a public relations disaster, likely to do long term political and indeed economic damage to the national interest. In this context, Ren√© Imbot accepted an invitation to appear on French television on 27 September 1985. In a memorably forceful presentation he stated his determination to \\"cut off the rotten branches\\" (\\"couper les branches pourries\\"), having identified \\"a truly malign conspiracy to destabilise the [intelligence] services\\" (\\"une v√©ritable op√©ration maligne de d√©stabilisation de nos services\\"). He retired from active service in 1988.

He studied as a painter at the Academy of Fine Arts in Florence, Italy, from 1997 until 2001. Ditsios now lives and works in Thessaloniki, Greece.  Personal life  Stavros Ditsios was born in Thessaloniki, Greece, where he grew up, and went to school in Panorama, Thessaloniki. His father was a merchant. At the age of seven, Ditsios took first prize in an exhibition for young artists in Y.M.C.A of Panorama, Thessaloniki. His parents organized a solo exhibition of his paintings in the back yard of his house, and his school also organized a solo exhibition for him. After finishing school he studied line drawing as preparation for the Fine Arts Academy in Florence. In 1996 he went to Siena in Italy to study Italian language. After passing the exams in 1997, he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts, where Professor Umberto Borella was among his tutors. Ditsios married a ballet teacher, Eva Fevgidou, in 2012, and they have a daughter.  Early career  While he was studying in Florence, Ditsios introduced his own technique called ‚ÄúVavoura‚Äù (confusion). Ditsios unsuccessfully attempted to demonstrate this outside the Uffizi Museum by offering tourists to draw on a 4x1 height canvas. While in Florence, he got engaged with music and he produced his own colour palette that corresponded to music notes inspired by Wassily Kandinskyy. After music, he began writing poetry. After finishing his studies, he moved to Thessaloniki, Greece, where he opened his own studio and began working in the family business of lighting equipment as a light designer.  Art  Distio‚Äôs work reflects mostly in an abstract expression all the sensual impressions around our daily life, be it sounds or philosophical ideas. In a world of constantly rising amount of sounds, pictures, videos and news he catches those moments in his art to allow to freeze it in time and space and to reach a moment of peace and calmness. ‚ÄúVavoura‚Äù (confusion) of all the various sounds do accumulate to one new standstill sound on the canvas.

The current St. Michael's Cathedral in Gyulafeh√©rv√°r (today Alba Iulia, Romania) was built during his term. Early life Peter was born into the gens Monoszl√≥ around 1240 as the son of Gregory II, who functioned as isp√°n of Krass√≥ County in 1255. His mother was an unidentified noblewoman from the gens B≈ë, possibly the daughter of Ders. His grandfather was Thomas I, the Ban of Slavonia between 1228 and 1229. Peter had two brothers, Egyed II, who served as Master of the treasury several times, and Gregory III, who was a relative of the royal √Årp√°d dynasty through his marriage. The three brothers supported each other in national politics and gradually distinguished themselves from the other branches of the Monoszl√≥ kindred. This intention also appeared in contemporary documents and charters, when their names were referred with the suffixes \\"de genere Thome bani\\" (\\"from Ban Thomas' kindred\\"), and later \\"de Filek\\", when the eldest one, Egyed was granted F√ºlek Castle (today Fiƒæakovo, Slovakia) by his lord, Duke Stephen. As the youngest of three brothers, Peter entered ecclesiastical career. It is unknown whether he attended a foreign university or was a pupil at the clerical school in Veszpr√©m. Nevertheless, he was first mentioned as \\"magister\\" which confirmed his literacy. In the emerging 1260s civil war between Stephen and his father, King B√©la IV, the Monoszl√≥ clan, including Peter remained loyal to the Duke. Peter held the office of vice-chancellor at Duke Stephen's court since 1266, replacing Lodomer. He served in that capacity until 1270, when Stephen ascended the Hungarian throne. Due to the activity of Stephen's chancellery, the literacy spread across Transylvania, following the other parts of the realm. Utilizing his past experience, Peter organized the first permanent episcopal chancellery in the province after he became bishop. Bishop of Transylvania First years The St. Michael's Cathedral, built by Peter Monoszl√≥ Peter was elected Bishop of Transylvania still before the death of B√©la IV, presumably in early 1270. His election was confirmed by the 1268‚Äì71 papal conclave by 13 June 1270. The new monarch, Stephen V rewarded the prelate's faithfulness for several years, when donated Kolozsv√°r (today Cluj- Napoca, Romania) and its surrounding areas to the Diocese of Transylvania, in addition to terra Obruth (today in Abrud, Romania) which was owned by the Transylvanian Chapter after 1271, according to later charters issued by Ladislaus IV and voivode Matthew Cs√°k, respectively. With the acquisition of Kolozsv√°r, Peter Monoszl√≥ encircled the landholdings of the bishopric's long- time rival, the Kolozsmonostor Abbey (today Cluj-MƒÉnƒÉ»ôtur, Romania), forcing the Benedictine friars for unfavorable estate transfers and exchanges. Peter established a contiguous bishopric lordship in the western parts of Kolozs County; for instance he exchanged the lands of Piski and (Hunyad County) and Akm√°r (Feh√©r County) for K√∂r√∂sf≈ë in Kolozs County (present-day Izvoru Cri»ôului, Romania) in 1276. The bishop also owned the nearby Kapus (CƒÉpu»ôu Mare) by 1282. When Stephen V fell ill and died on 6 August 1272, it marked the beginning of the era of feudal anarchy, when two rival baronial groups struggled for power during the minority of Ladislaus IV under his mother, Elizabeth's regency. Peter, along with his kindred, supported the Cs√°k league against the K≈ëszegi‚ÄìGutkeled‚ÄìGeregye faction. Peter's brothers, Egyed and Gregory laid siege in late August to the Dowager Queen's palace in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r to \\"rescue\\" Ladislaus from the rival baronial group's influence. After the failure, they fled Hungary and handed over Pressburg (today Bratislava, Slovakia) to Ottokar II of Bohemia. Peter did not participate in his brothers' conspiracy, but became disgraced before the royal court, losing any support and further donations to the diocese. From 1272, Nicholas Geregye served as Voivode of Transylvania. His clan had aspirations to establish dominion independently from the royal power. Both Peter and his strong ally, Lodomer, Bishop of V√°rad opposed this ambition. Until 1275, Matthew Cs√°k and Nicholas Geregye, rivals to each other, became voivodes several times in acorrdance with their baronial groups' rapid rises and falls in those turbulent years. Ladislaus IV confirmed the donation of Kolozsv√°r to the Diocese of Transylvania in 1275. Both Egyed and Gregory lost all political influence for uncertain reasons after 1275, as they had never hold any dignities after that, despite the fact that their allies, the Cs√°k group was able to return to govern the realm even at the end of the year. Peter remained the only member of his kindred who was influential over political matters following that year. By 1276, the St. Michael's Cathedral was rebuilt on the old foundation, which was formerly destroyed during the Mongol invasion of Hungary in 1241. Peter also ordered the construction of Szentmih√°lyk≈ë Castle (today in ruins near Mete»ô, Romania) in the same year. The Transyvanian Chapter asked permission at the same time through their envoys, provost Clement and dean Bartholomew from Ladislaus to receive privilege of tax exemption at the transportation of excavated product from the salt mine in Torda (today Turda, Romania). Saxon rebellion In 1277, Peter Monoszl√≥ had to face with a widespread revolt among the Saxons which caused severe destructions in Transylvania. According to historian Jen≈ë Sz≈±cs, Peter intended to extend the bishopric's influence over the provostry of Szeben (today Sibiu, Romania), but encountered sharp resistance from the Saxons. The bishop responded with violence, and a certain Alard, gr√§f (ger√©b) of the Saxon community in V√≠zakna (today Ocna Sibiului, Romania) was executed along with three canons. Alard's son, John took revenge and led a revolt against the diocese. The rebellion spread quickly, the infuriated Saxons stormed into the newly built St. Michael's Cathedral, see of the diocese on 21 February, looted the treasury, desecrated the shrines and massacred there about 2,000 asylum seekers, including canons, archdeacons and other priests. The Saxons also scorched and burned churches in the surrounding countryside. Peter's immediate superior, Stephen B√°ncsa, the Archbishop of Kalocsa considered the revolt as \\"ethnically motivated\\" which was strengthened by the Saxons' \\"wistfulness for robbery\\". However earlier charters confirmed Peter's ethnic ignorance: he had approved the Saxon Dominicans' indulgences in Segesv√°r (today Sighi»ôoara, Romania) and also employed Saxon carpenters at the construction of the St. Michael's Cathedral. The convened assembly at R√°kos in May 1277 declared Ladislaus to be of age. The Estates authorized the fifteen-year-old monarch to restore internal peace with all possible means. On 30 May, B√°ncsa summoned an ecclesiastic congregatio in Buda, where Peter and other six bishops participated, and excommunicated John and his Saxon followers. The prelates also ordered them to pay reparations for their \\"devilish fury rampage\\". Despite the sentence, Peter had to rebuild the cathedral from own budget ten years later, when commissioned stonemason John, son of Tyno to erect and restore the cathedral's damaged walls and tower. Ladislaus' faithful prelate, Archbishop-elect Nicholas K√°n launched a royal punitive expedition against the Saxons in Szeben region in 1278, in the same time with the defeat of the Geregye dominion. As compensation, Peter was granted destroyed royal lands in Gyulafeh√©rv√°r for the purpose of colonization. The bishop started to construct episcopal castles throughout the diocese. For instance, Le√°nyv√°r in Sz√°szfenes (today Flore»ôti, Romania) was built between 1282 and 1300 to invigilate the local Saxon communities and the rival Kolozsmonostor Abbey. He acquired the village (then simply Fenes) itself sometime between 1291 and 1299, which then split into Saxon and Vlach-inhabited parts after the latter's settlement by Peter Monoszl√≥ (present-day Flore»ôti and Vlaha in Romania, respectively). Feudal anarchy The papal legate Philip, Bishop of Fermo arrived to Hungary in early 1279 to help Ladislaus to consolidate his authority, but the prelate was shocked at the presence of thousands of pagan Cumans in the realm. Since then Peter Monoszl√≥, along with the other bishops, resided in Buda until October 1280. He participated in that synod which was committed to the defense of the Catholic faith and prescribed that the Cumans should leave their tents and live \\"in houses attached to the ground\\". Following that Ladislaus forced prelates to leave Buda for Pressburg, where Philip excommunicated him and placed Hungary under interdict in October. After that Peter resided in Esztergom at the archiepiscopal court of his mentor, Lodomer. In 1281, local noble comes Stephen accused Peter's two familiares, Michael Chotow and Fuldur forcibly deported thirty-serf families and seized a huge part in the land of Gyovd, near Tasn√°d (today TƒÉ»ônad, Romania) for the diocese. A trial was convened at Buda in September 1281, where Stephen was forced to resigne from third part of the possession after an interrupted duel. In the same year, Peter filed a lawsuit against three members of the Dara branch of the Cs√°k kindred, Michael, Ugrin and Barc, also owners of Sel√©nd (today »òilindia, Romania), accusing them with arbitrary takeover of the diocese's land, Bar√°tp√ºsp√∂ki in Bihar County. Through the mediation of vice-judge royal Stephen, the two litigants agreed with each other by releasing a smaller area to the Cs√°k brothers. According to a charter from 1282, Peter's army destroyed quickly-built castles inhabited by highwaymen and robbers along the Szamos (Some»ô). On 23 June 1283, Peter signed a contract with the deacon of the Saxon ecclesial community in Medgyes (today Media»ô, Romania) to transmit the diocese's share of the collection of church taxes in the area for annual forty silver denari. Mongols in Hungary in 1285, depicted in the Illuminated Chronicle The Mongols of the Golden Horde invaded Hungary under the command of Khans Talabuga and Nogai in January 1285. Talabuga's main army was defeated by the Hungarian troops, while Nogai stayed in Transylvania until the spring of 1286. Meanwhile, Ladislaus also subjugated a rebellion in the Szepess√©g in September 1285. In Transylvania, Nogai plundered some towns and villages, such as Sz√°szr√©gen, Brass√≥ and Beszterce (today Reghin, Bra»ôov and Bistri»õa in Romania, respectively). He also managed to destroy a few forts and walled towns. However, like Talabuga, he failed to take any major fortifications. His army was defeated by Roland Borsa, who served as Voivode of Transylvania since 1284. He was the first baron, who tried to establish a de facto independent dominion in the province, taking advantage of Ladislaus' unpopularity and shocking measures. Through Egyed's unidentified daughter who married Roland's nephew, Stephen, he was akin to Bishop Peter. Despite that family relationship, Peter's relation to the Borsas was ambiguous and fluctuating. Peter, in accordance with the position of the Catholic Church and Archbishop Lodomer, was interested in a strong central power, opposing such local authority efforts. For instance, Peter sued back the right to collect tithe in Ugocsa County from James Borsa, brother of Roland in 1288. Lodomer summoned the prelates, the barons, and the noblemen to an assembly in Buda and excommunicated Ladislaus in September 1287, following the release of Queen Elizabeth of Sicily, who was imprisoned by her husband, King Ladislaus IV. Lodomer here also entrusted Peter to recover the arbitrarily confiscated queenly estates surrounding Beszterce from the town's magistrate. Ladislaus's favoritism towards the Cumans made him so unpopular that many of his subjects accused him of inciting the Mongols to invade Hungary years earlier. Peter shared this viewpoint, as a result, according to a false diploma, he captured and imprisoned √Årb√≥c (a Cuman maternal relative of Ladislaus IV) and Voivode Mojs √Åkos on the instruction of Lodomer and the archiepiscopal synod in 1288, mistakenly thought that they had planned to go the Mongols as the envoys of Ladislaus, searching for help against the Hungarian prelates and barons to strengthen his power. They were released soon. For this role, Ladislaus IV temporarily confiscated the diocese's lands of Kolozsv√°r and Gyulafeh√©rv√°r, in addition to surrounding areas and associated privileges, but in September 1289, the king has returned them to Peter, when personally visited the episcopal see. In the same year, Peter appointed his maternal relative, Michael B≈ë as grand provost of Transylvania, serving in this capacity until 1296. According to a legal document from 1288, local nobles John and Kem√©ny, sons of Mikola had caused 160 silver denari damage to episcopal estates during an unspecific event earlier. As a result, the Transylvanian generalis congregatio, citing Roland Borsa's earlier judgment, inducted Peter as owner of his enemies' estates of Gyer≈ëv√°s√°rhely, Szt√°na and Szam√°rtelke in Kolozs County (today Dumbrava and Stana in Romania, respectively, while Szam√°rtelke did not exist since the New Age) until the fulfillment of compensation. It is possible the expenses of future constructions were mostly covered by this award of damages. An influential baron, Mikod K√∂k√©nyesradn√≥t donated Kopp√°nd and Iv√°nkatelke (today CopƒÉceni and C«épt«élan in Romania) to the Diocese of Transylvania, fulfilling the last testaments of his late brother, Emeric, who otherwise, was the father-in-law of Peter's brother, Egyed and made that donation for triggering his former pledge to participate in a crusade. Peter Monoszl√≥ also acquired several landholdings in Kalotaszeg region (»öara CƒÉlatei). Peter populated the villages across the Gyalu (GilƒÉu) Mountains with Vlach (Romanian) serfs since the 1290s. The bishop intended to put the seat of his episcopal lordship in Gyalu (present-day GilƒÉu), as Kolozsv√°r was granted the status of a city only in 1316. Peter also built a palace in Gyalu. During the episcopate of Peter, at least six churches were built throughout in Kolozs County, including in Kolozsv√°r and Gyalu. In addition to Le√°nyv√°r in Sz√°szfenes, the bishop also built another castle (Szentmih√°lyk≈ë) near T√≥tfalud in Feh√©r County (today TƒÉu»õi, Romania). Over the decades, Peter had several conflicts with Andrew, Bishop of Eger, who served in that capacity from 1275 to 1305. The main source of the conflict was the issue of jurisdiction over the sparsely populated M√°ramaros region (today Maramure»ô in Romania). Since the rule of Andrew II of Hungary, it, alongside Ugocsa and Bereg, belonged to the Diocese of Eger, later confirmed by both B√©la IV and Stephen V. In the early 13th century, M√°ramaros was mostly part of S√°sv√°r isp√°nate. In 1230, the Archdeaconry of S√°sv√°r was already under the ecclesiastical administration of the Diocese of Transylvania. In 1288, Ladislaus IV gave the right to collect tithe to Peter Monoszl√≥, at the same time with the church taxes in Ugocsa County. When M√°ramaros County emerged in the territory following large-scale resettlements, increasing its significance, Andrew has claimed jurisdiction over the region. Andrew's partisan Ladislaus IV was assassinated by three Cumans, including the above-mentioned √Årb√≥c, on 10 July 1290. Archbishop Lodomer subsequently dispatched two monks to Vienna to inform Andrew the Venetian, a pretender to the Hungarian throne, of the king's death. Along with the other prelates, Peter supported him and swore loyalty to Andrew, who was crowned king on 23 July by Lodomer. He participated in the diet summoned by the new monarch. While visiting Transylvania in March 1291, Andrew III confirmed the privileges of the diocese. Here he also issued the decrees of his 1290 diet at the assembly of the local noblemen, Saxons and Sz√©kelys, in February or March. Andrew extended privileges at other estates in the diocese, Peter received higher revenues, thus decided to renovate the roof of the St. Michael's Cathedral, when entrusted Saxon professionals and architects in May 1291. Peter was a staunch supporter of Andrew III, who, nonetheless, granted the jurisdiction over M√°ramaros to the Diocese of Eger. After Peter's protest and pressure, he changed his intention, withdrawing the decision, and handed over the matter to the competence of John Hont-P√°zm√°ny, the Archbishop of Kalocsa. As Andrew, Bishop of Eger did not present at the archbishopric chancellery and Emeric, Bishop of V√°rad conducted on-site inspections among the local noblemen, who mostly supported Peter, King Andrew III decided to donate M√°ramaros to the Diocese of Transylvania. In response, Bishop Andrew has launched a new lawsuit, while Peter initiated an investigation to the Holy See, arguing with the unauthorized nature of the secular courts. Peter also complained about that Bishop Andrew dedicated \\"unduly\\" churches and cemeteries in M√°ramaros even in 1299. The outcome of the lawsuit can not be reconstructed because of the lack of sources, however a few decades later, M√°ramaros belonged to the Diocese of Eger according to the papal tithe registers. When Roland Borsa besieged and captured the Diocese of V√°rad's fortress at Fenes (today Fini»ô in Romania) on 23 May 1294, Andrew III held a general assembly and outlawed him. The king also laid siege to Borsa's fort at Adorj√°n (now Adrian in Romania). After his victory, Andrew replaced Roland Borsa with Ladislaus K√°n as Voivode of Transylvania, but the former preserved all his domains in the lands east of the Tisza. The new voivode became the undisputed leader of Transylvania, and ruled the region de facto independently for the upcoming two decades. Former historiographical works assumed family relationship between Bishop Peter and him, based on a diploma from 1306, where Peter referred to Ladislaus as his \\"frater\\". However, in Latin in Medieval Hungary, the phrase also meant \\"ally\\" or \\"friend\\". Nevertheless, their relationship in the 1290s was cooperative, as both of them supported Andrew against the royal power's enemies. For instance, Bishop Peter's maternal relative, Peter B≈ë held the dignity of Count of the Sz√©kelys from 1294 to 1300, during the first years of Ladislaus K√°n. Archbishop Lodomer died in January 1298. His successor, Gregory Bicskei, the Archbishop-elect and Apostolic Administrator of Esztergom supported the Capetian House of Anjou's claims to the Hungarian throne against Andrew. The king held an assembly of the prelates, noblemen, Saxons, Sz√©kelys, and Cumans in Pest in the summer of 1298, where Peter also participated as the third ranking member among the prelates due to his old age and date of assumption of office. Peter remained in the capital until the next year. Gregory Bicskei forbade the prelates to participate at a new diet which was held in 1299. Archbishop John Hont-P√°zm√°ny and the bishops, including Peter Monoszl√≥, ignored his order. According to a non-authentic document, Bishop Peter unsuccessfully tried to reconcile Andrew III and Bicskei. Another false charter claims Bicskei excommunicated Peter and the other bishops, because they remained supporters of Andrew. Interregnum Andrew III died on 14 January 1301, with his death, the House of √Årp√°d became extinct. In the evolving struggle for the throne, historian J√°nos Temesv√°ry claimed Peter Monoszl√≥ joined the party that offered the crown to Wenceslaus, the son of King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia. He also wrote Peter was present at Wenceslaus' coronation on 27 August 1301, and became Charles' loyal only after Pope Boniface VIII declared Charles the lawful king of Hungary on 31 May 1303. Temesv√°ry justified his argument with data that formerly Peter did not attend that synod in Buda which was convoked by papal legate Niccolo Boccasini in 1302. In contrast, Tudor SƒÉlƒÉgean considers that Peter's relative, Michael B≈ë, now the Bishop of Zagreb, was one of the first partisans of Charles I beside Archbishop Bicskei. In addition, Peter tried to send 100 silver denari, which would have cover the costs of Boccasini's activity, according to a charter issued in 1302. When Charles I signed an alliance with his cousin Rudolph III of Austria in Pressburg on 24 August 1304, Bishop Peter was among the barons and prelates, who did the same thing in a royal charter. Meanwhile, his relationship with Ladislaus K√°n remained fluctuating. On the eve of the extinction of the √Årp√°d dynasty, the voivode's men looted the clergymen in Hunyad and H√°tszeg (today Hunedoara and Ha»õeg, Romania). In response, Peter Monoszl√≥ and the chapter lodged a complaint to Pope Boniface VIII. After the death of Andrew III, Peter was interested in a strong central power, supported and influenced by the Catholic Church, while Ladislaus K√°n endeavoured to strengthen his authority, sometimes by using or abusing his office of Voivode of Transylvania. Otherwise in 1306, when the voivode was reluctant to recognise the rule of Charles, whose claim had been supported by the Catholic Church, Pope Clement V ordered Vincent, Archbishop of Kalocsa to excommunicate him and to place Transylvania under ecclesiastic interdict. Peter Monoszl√≥ disagreed with that step and expressed his displeasure. As a result, Vincent held out the prospect of the same ecclesiastic disciplinary actions against Peter in case he would not excommunicate Ladislaus K√°n who had seized the properties of the prelate of Kalocsa. Some weeks later Vincent withdrew the punishment at the request of Charles and Ugrin Cs√°k, if Peter fulfills the Pope's order. SƒÉlƒÉgean argues, the elderly Peter lost effective control over the diocese by 1306, and K√°n's loyal clergyman, John Bog√°tradv√°ny, Archdeacon of K√ºk√ºll≈ë, who led Peter's chancellery from that year, took control in Gyulafeh√©rv√°r. According to the Saxons, who litigated the Transylvanian Chapter in 1309, Bishop Peter participated in that conspiracy, when Ladislaus K√°n captured King Otto of Hungary, rival of Charles I, during his visit in Transylvania, and had him imprisoned in one of his castles. Peter Monoszl√≥ died on 27 November 1307, ending his almost 38-year term as Bishop of Transylvania. After his death, Voivode Ladislaus K√°n intended to elect his own son, Ladislaus V as Peter's successor, thus captured the canons who had assembled to elect the new bishop. However, due to objection by the chapter, in July 1308, declared that he would not maintain his son's claim to the bishopric. He suggested two new candidates to the canons. By July 1309, the threatened canons were yielding to extortion and elected Benedict, a former councillor of Peter, as the new Bishop of Transylvania. Peter Monoszl√≥ was the first bishop who was buried in the St. Michael's Cathedral.

A graduate of the Royal College of Art, London, he has exhibited his painting in the US and the UK since the late seventies. His work is represented in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the Museum of the Rhode Island School of Design as well as many private collections. Early life and career John Parks was born the son of the Rev. Harold Parks and Joan Parks (n√©e McDowell) in Leeds England in 1952, one of three siblings. His younger brother, Tim Parks, is a novelist and critic. Parks was educated at Woodhouse College in London before attending Hull College of Art and then the Royal College of Art where he studied under Leonard Rosoman. He exhibited twice at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibitions while still at the Royal College. In 1974 he was awarded a scholarship to the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, where he met his future wife, Melanie Marder. The couple lived in London for two years where Parks completed the Pears Portrait Commission as well as a number of private portrait commissions. They moved to New York in late 1976. From 1977 onwards Parks exhibited his work with the Allan Stone Gallery in New York City mounting one man shows in 1979, 1980, 1982, 1984 and 1987. In 1990 and 1992 he mounted exhibitions at Coe Kerr Gallery, New York. He returned to Allan Stone Gallery in 1995 and mounted a last exhibition there in 2005. His work is currently represented by 532 Gallery Thomas Jaeckel in New York Parks was awarded a grant from the National Endowment of the Arts in 1987. Parks has been a member of the faculty of the School of Visual Arts in New York since 1979 where he has taught courses in drawing, gouache painting, realist techniques and portrait painting. He and his wife have one son, Alexander Parks, born 1987.  Works  Parks‚Äô work has focused largely on British themes, first in small scale realist paintings of London suburbs from the mid- seventies to the early eighties, and later in larger scale more expressionist paintings of the mid-eighties. The latter featured images of British public imagery including guardsmen, policemen and buildings such as Buckingham Palace and the Houses of Parliament. A 2005 exhibition featured reworkings of quintessential English imagery such as hunting scenes, polo players, castles and steam trains. His recent work has often included paintings executed with his fingers, including a suite of paintings recreating his English childhood exhibited in New York in 2012. He has also written many feature articles in various art magazines including pieces on Raphael, Goya, Philip Pearlstein and David Beck. He is the author of one book, ‚ÄúUniversal Principles of Art,‚Äù (Rockport Publishing, 2014), a broad introduction to the world of art.  Critical Reaction  Parks‚Äô work has been well reviewed throughout his career. Writing in the New York Times in 1982 John Russell said of him: ‚ÄúA true poet in paint, Mr. Parks is something of a find.\\" In December 2012, Roberta Smith reviewed Parks‚Äô exhibition in the New York Times writing: ‚ÄúThe strange, seemingly innocent paintings that dominate this show are small, based on Mr. Parks‚Äôs childhood memories and painted using only his fingers.

It was written in the 1920s for a musical theatrical work, but now is most commonly associated with the eponymous 1936 Mexican motion picture All√° en el Rancho Grande, in which it was sung by renowned actor and singer Tito Gu√≠zar and with mariachis. Bing Crosby recorded the song on April 3, 1939 as \\"El Rancho Grande\\" and it reached the No. 6 spot in the charts during a ten-week stay in 1939. Crosby recorded the song again in 1954 for the album Bing: A Musical Autobiography. The song was featured in the film Mexicali Rose (1939) starring Gene Autry. Autry also made a commercial recording of the song. Others to record the song are Al Bowlly (as \\"Give Me My Ranch\\"), Artie Shaw and Dean Martin (on his Dino Latino album). In 1958 the song was covered by Rex Allen on his album Mister Cowboy on the Decca record label. Elvis Presley sang the song when playing around at the rehearsals for the documentary film That's the Way It Is (on Wednesday, July 15, 1970). His performance was recorded and, in 1995, released by BMG on the box set Walk a Mile in My Shoes: The Essential '70s Masters.

This subspecies has not been seen, in the wild or in cultivation, since 1937. Description *Stems: Range from glabrous (smooth) to tomentose (furry). *Leaves: Leaf arrangement is alternate. Upper leaf surfaces are hairy and rough or tomentose, while the lower leaf surfaces are more or less finely tomentose. *Inflorescences: Variable number of flowers are borne in round or flat-topped clusters. Peduncles (flower stalks) and phyllaries (involucral bracts) are densely hairy. Flowers from August‚ÄìOctober. **Ray Florets: Typically 12-21 ray florets per capitulum.

The pinnacle of her career was in the 1960s, achieved through her work with Maurice B√©jart when she was one of the most popular ballerinas in the world.  Early life and education  She was born on 15 October 1933 in Skoplje, Kingdom of Yugoslavia (now Skopje, in Republic of North Macedonia). She became member of the National Theatre in Belgrade in 1951, and in 1953 graduated from the ballet gymnasium in the class of Nina Kirsanova. Later, she was also tutored by great choreographers Leonid Lavrovsky, Asaf Messerer and Victor Gsovsky.  Career   National Theatre  Noticing Sifnios's talent, Kirsanova almost immediately placed her a soloist and soon she became a prima ballerina. Her early performances were choreographed by Dimitrije Parliƒá, and included Eurydice in Orpheus by Igor Stravinsky and Juliet in Sergey Prokofiev‚Äôs Romeo and Juliet. Other roles, choreographed by Pino Mlakar, Milko ≈†paremblek, Ugo Dell‚Äôara, Vera Kostiƒá and Anica Preliƒá, include a string of first-class performances like Swanhilde (Copp√©lia by L√©o Delibes), Ela (The Devil in the village by Fran Lhotka), La reine des iles by Maurice Thiriet and Les Sylphides by Chopin. Her two most successful roles in this period, however, were Giselle, by Adolphe Adam, and The Girl in The Miraculous Mandarin, by B√©la Bart√≥k. Mandarin was choreographed by Parliƒá in 1957, while Giselle was revived in Belgrade by Lavrovsky and marked a turning point in Sifnios‚Äô career. She performed it 177 times in The National Theatre and went on an extensive touring of Europe: Venice, Edinburgh. Vienna, Wiesbaden, Florence, Rome, Zurich, Berlin and Paris, with Giselle becoming a great success in Bolshoy Theatre in Moscow.  International career  In 1958 she moved to Paris and became a member of Milorad Mi≈°koviƒá ‚Äòs dance company and then L√©onide Massine‚Äôs Ballet Europeo in Rome in 1959.  Bol√©ro and Ballet of the 20th century  In Rome in 1960 she was noticed by Maurice B√©jart and became a member of his dance troop Ballet of the 20th Century and his muse. Especially for her, B√©jart choreographed Maurice Ravel‚Äôs Bol√©ro, which is today considered a masterpiece of the modern ballet. It premiered on 10 January 1961, featuring Sifnios dancing on the tabletop, first stepping to the tune's simplicity, surrounded by seated men, who, in turn, slowly participate in the dance, adding complexity to the building in the orchestration, culminating in a climactic union of the dancers atop the table. Sifnios became world-famous. After her, the role was later performed by Maya Plisetskaya, Sylvie Guillem, Grazia Galante, Ang√®le Albrecht and, in the male version, by Jorge Donn. As a principal dancer of the company, she toured Europe (France, Germany, Poland, Italy, Spain, Great Britain, Belgium), Africa (Tunisia), Asia (Israel, Lebanon) and Latin America (Mexico, Argentina, Cuba), performing the roles in Les quatre fils Aymon by Fernand Schirren (1961), Mati√©re by Alban Berg (1962), The Wedding (1962) and The Firebird (1964) by Stravinsky, Symphony No. 9 by Beethoven (1964), L‚Äôart de la barre by Johann Sebastian Bach (1965), Cantates by Anton Webern (1966) and Abraxas by Werner Egk. She appeared in televised ballet La Boutique fantasque by Gioacchino Rossini/Ottorino Respighi, in TV dance versions of The Blue Danube by Johann Strauss II and The Tales of Hoffmann by Jacques Offenbach (for Bavarian Television) and in the movie Bol√©ro.  Later career  Sifnios was a freelance dancer from 1970, but she continued to work with the Ballet of the 20th Century as a guest artist. She retired at the age of 47. In the early 2000s she co-choreographed several ballets in Belgrade, including the revival of The Miraculous Mandarin in 2001 in the National Theatre and Liederabend by Gustav Mahler in 2002 in Madlenianum Opera and Theatre. She published an autobiography Bele≈°ke slavne balerine in 2013 (Notes of a famous ballerina) even though she stated in an interview that she doesn‚Äôt think of her as a ballerina but as a ‚Äúwoman who dances‚Äù.  Awards  She received an award for life achievement, the highest accolade of the ‚ÄúAssociation of the ballet artists of Serbia‚Äù in 1998 and was a recipient of the ‚ÄúSpecial recognition for artistic contribution to the national culture of Serbia‚Äú, colloquially styled national pension in 2007. Madlenianum Opera has named one of its halls \\"Sifnios Hall\\", in ballerina's honor. The hall is mainly intended for educational ballet work.\\"Sifnios Hall  Opera & Theatre Madlenianum\\". operatheatremadlenianum.com.  Style  Already at the beginning of her career she presented exceptional talent, expressing a superb command over classical ballet technique, sweetness and ease with which she performed even the most complicated choreographies. Her dancing was characterized by secure technique, beauty of the lines and a specific charm. Later she danced only the modern ballet repertoire and gradually grew into a strong dancing individuality which, apart from brilliant technique, possessed inner impulsiveness which gave unusual strength to her creations. On the very first rehearsal for Bol√©ro, B√©jart‚Äôs told her to take off her shoes. She continued to perform often without shoes, earning the nickname ‚Äúbarefoot ballerina‚Äù.  Personal life  On meeting her husband, Belgian conductor Andr√© Vandernoot, Sifnios said in an interview that Bol√©ro gave her a husband, too: ‚ÄùBefore one of the performances, B√©jart told me not to pay attention on anyone else and to look only at the conductor. I listened to him, watched at the conductor, the Belgian, and later married him, had two children and lived through so many things‚Äù. They had two children, daughter Alexandra Vandernoot, an actress, and son, Patrick Vandernoot, a golf instructor. She died on 14 October 2016, one day before her 83rd birthday, in Brussels, after four months of illness.

The act mandated the exclusive use of English-medium education in Scotland, in effect banning Scottish Gaelic medium education. For this reason it is credited with causing substantial harm to the Scottish Gaelic language and contributing to its overall decline. Background In 1866 the government established the Argyll Commission, under Whig grandee George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll, to look into the schooling system. It found that of 500,000 children in need of education 200,000 were receiving it under efficient conditions, 200,000 in schools of doubtful merit, without any inspection and 90,000 were receiving no education at all. Although this compared favourably with the situation in England, with 14% more children in education and with relatively low illiteracy rates of between 10 and 20%, similar to those in the best-educated nations such as those in Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Scandinavia, the report was used as support for widespread reform. The result was the 1872 Education (Scotland) Act, based on that passed for England and Wales as the Elementary Education Act 1870, but providing a more comprehensive solution. The Act Under the act approximately 1,000 regional school boards were established and, unlike in England where they merely attempted to fill gaps in provision, immediately took over the schools of the old and new kirks and were able to begin to enforce attendance, rather than after the decade necessary in England. Some ragged and industrial schools requested to be taken over by the boards, while others continued as Sunday schools. All children aged from 5 to 13 years were to attend. Poverty was not accepted as an excuse and some help was supplied under the Poor laws. This was enforced by the School Attendance Committee, while the boards busied themselves with building to fill the gaps in provision. This resulted in a major programme that created large numbers of grand, purpose-built schools. Overall administration was in the hands of the Scotch (later Scottish) Education Department in London. Demand for places was high and for a generation after the act there was overcrowding in many classrooms, with up to 70 children being taught in one room. The emphasis on a set number of passes at exams also led to much learning by rote and the system of inspection led to even the weakest children being drilled with certain facts. Effect on Gaelic The Education (Scotland) Act 1872 effectively put an end to non-English medium education and repressed Gaelic with pupils being punished for speaking the language. Pupils were belted if caught speaking in Gaelic and beaten again if they did not reveal the names of other students speaking Gaelic. The effect of the education act upon the Gaelic language has been described as \\"disastrous\\" and by denying the value of Gaelic culture and language, contributed to destroying the self-respect of Gaelic communities. It was a continuation of a general policy (by both Scottish and, after 1707, British governments) which aimed at Anglicisation. As a result of facing punishment and humiliation for speaking Gaelic, many parents decided not to pass on the language to their children, resulting in language shift. Scottish Gaelic medium education was not established until the 1980s, and the impact of the Act is still being felt in Gaelic communities today.

It is located 9 kilometers from a major settlement of the Hallstatt and early La T√®ne period, the Heuneburg. Alte Burg lies in the municipality of Langenenslingen in Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany. From left: main rampart, moat, middle rampart Stone sill around the pit Southeastern terrace Excavations in 2014: cross-section through the main rampart Excavations in 2015: dry stone walls at the main rampart Geography Location The Alte Burg lies on a long spur of the hill Burgberg, at an elevation of around 695 m above NN, at the southern edge of the Swabian Jura. It is located almost 3 kilometers north west of Langenenslingen. The Heuneburg, a major settlement of the Hallstatt period overlooking the Danube, is about 9 kilometers to the south east. Another hillfort, Gro√üe Heuneburg, lies to the north east. History The remains were originally interpreted in a medieval context, as the border between Langenenslingen and Emerfeld, and between W√ºrttemberg and Hohenzollern followed the central wall. In 1894, an excavation was conducted that discovered the pit (see below) which was interpreted as a burial mound. A modern excavation followed in 2006/7 and discovered bone fragments that were dated to the 3rd or 4th century BC. Excavations have been resumed in 2014 and are ongoing. Description The tongue-shaped plateau of around 2 hectares is closed off towards the north east by two exterior ramparts, a deep moat and a large main rampart. Even today, the top of the main rampart is up to 12 meters above the bottom of the moat. Towards the valley the plateau is flanked by two terraces, 15 (north west) and 20 meters (south east) below the top. At the bottom of the slope another rampart and moat surround the hill. The entry to the fort was likely to the north east. The plateau had been increased in size by the construction of dry stone walls that were then filled with rubble (stone and clay). Small stone walls on top of the plateau were built, with one cutting across the plateau in the centre, thus dividing the level area in two halves. This was the line later followed by the municipal border. The main wall to the northeast was 13 meters thick and at least 10 meters high. It consisted of an external and internal dry stone wall with rubble filling in between. This wall was linked to another of around 40 meters length and around 5.8 meters thickness that radiated away towards the north east. It is likely that there was a gate at that point controlling access to the plateau. The main wall has been dated to the 7th to 5th century BC. It is the largest known construction of this type from the period in question north of the Alps. The outer rampart (of rubble and clay) was up to 2 meters high and around 18 meters thick and had no moat. The middle rampart, located on the exterior side of the moat, was at least 1.8 meters high and was built mainly from limestone. The central pit was dug around 5 meters deep into the limestone plateau. It is surrounded by a type of stone ledge or bank. Inside this pit the 1894 excavation discovered six human skeletons. Findings mostly date from the Hallstatt period. Some metal items from the pit area are early La T√®ne. Later deposits include Medieval pottery. A single Urnfield culture, i.e. pre-Celtic, pin has been found. The plateau and the ramparts are now partially covered by trees. Interpretation There is no evidence of houses. Another large settlement so close to Heuneburg is also deemed unlikely and the pit points to some form of cult activity. Thus the Alte Burg is thought to have probably served as a cult site to the sizeable Hallstadt period population of the area, possibly also as a place where assemblies and/or games and contests too place. The original reading of the pit as a burial site is now discounted as no burial objects have been found. Given this arrangement, a use of the pit in some form of cult, as a sacrificial pit, is now considered to be the likeliest interpretation.

Retrieved 13 January 2017. was an academic historian specialising in 19th-century British politics and the trade union movement.  Early life and war service  Arthur Frederick Thompson was born on 9 June 1920 at Preston, Lancashire, the son of a Londonderry-born civil servant. Three years later, the family followed his father's work to Northern Ireland (he was a senior finance officer in the government) and then in 1936 to London. After schooling at Campbell College and Dulwich College, Thompson was admitted to Magdalen College, Oxford, as an exhibitioner to study history and was taught by K. B. McFarlane and A. J. P. Taylor. After graduating with a first-class degree in 1941, he trained as a paratrooper and served in World War II. Wounded in Normandy in 1944, he was moved over to GCHQ at Bletchley Park and then, with the war over, returned to Oxford.Ross McKibbin, \\"Pat Thompson\\", The Guardian, 29 October 2009. Retrieved 13 January 2017.  Career  Although he passed the civil service examination with a very high score, Thompson accepted an offer to become a tutor at Wadham College, Oxford, in 1947, and remained there for the rest of his career, serving as domestic burser, senior tutor and sub-warden. His academic studies began with 19th- century politics, and he intended to mix Sir Lewis Namier's style of analysis with careful studies of voting behaviour and apply these approaches to the premiership of William Gladstone. His attention gradually turned towards the progressive and radical political movements of the latter part of that century and from there to the origins of the labour movement, focusing especially on the role of trade unions and industrial relations ‚Äì a school of thought pioneered by him and his colleagues at Oxford, Hugh Clegg and Alan Fox. A life-long attachment to Gladstone persisted and he sat on the committee overseeing the publication of the statesman's diaries, most of the editing of which was carried out by Thompson's former research student, Colin Matthew. Although Thompson authored some notable works, in particular the first volume of A History of British Trade Unions since 1889 (1964), which he co-authored with Clegg and Fox, and \\"Gladstone's Whips at the General Election of 1868\\" (1948), he wrote relatively little. But, he was a deemed a 'major force' in history teaching at Oxford during his four decades at Wadham: he was, in the words of The Independent, \\"alternately acerbic and avuncular, iconoclastic and inspiring, and always generous with his time\\". His unique style of teaching produced a number of outstanding academics, notably Colin Matthew and Ross McKibbin; his pupils included Melvyn Bragg and Julian Mitchell.

It is one of three regional breeds in the area, the others being the Valdostana Pezzata Nera and the Valdostana Pezzata Rossa. The Valdostana Castana ranges in colour from chestnut-brown to black. It derives from cross-breeding of imported H√©rens stock with the local Pezzata Nera (black-pied) cattle. While the Valdostana Castana is raised both for meat and for milk, its principal characteristic is its ability in the Bataille de Reines, the annual cow-fighting contests held in the region. Partly due to its combative nature, it is not suited to intensive farming, and management is normally transhumant: the cattle are stabled only in winter, and spend the summer months on the mountain pastures of the Alps.  History  The Valdostana Castana is a relatively recent breed; only black-pied and red-pied cattle are documented in the Valle d'Aosta in texts of the early twentieth century. Despite the strict regulations governing the herd-book for the Valdostana Pezzata Nera, breeders introduced imported H√©rens blood. The Castana was officially recognised by the Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari e Forestali, the Italian ministry of agriculture, in 1985. It is registered in the herd-book of the Pezzata Nera, and is considered to differ from it only in the colour of the coat. The Valdostana Castana was originally confined to the , but has since spread throughout the region and into northern Piemonte, in the Valli di Lanzo and the . Most of the population is concentrated in the hills flanking the valley of the Dora Baltea between Ch√¢tillon and Aosta. In 2014 the total population was reported to be head.  Characteristics  The Valdostana Castana ranges in colour from chestnut-brown to black. The hooves and mucosa are slate- coloured or black. It is robust and hardy, and well able to exploit high mountain pasture. Its principal characteristic is its ability in the Bataille de Reines, the annual cow-fighting contests held in the Valle d'Aosta region. Partly due to its combative nature, it is not suited to intensive farming; management is transhumant: the cattle are stabled only in winter, and spend the summer months on the mountain pastures of the Alps.  Use  While the Valdostana Castana is raised both for meat and for milk, its principal characteristic is its ability in the Bataille de Reines, the annual cow- fighting contests held in the region. Despite recent selection for improved dairy performance, milk yields remain low. The average is per lactation; the milk has 3.4% fat and 3.3% protein. Informal cow-fighting contests have been documented for more than 150 years. In the Valle d'Aosta, formal management of fights dates from 1958, when the Comit√© Regional des Batailles de Reines was formed. The contests have become an important socio-cultural event. Some twenty contests are held between March and October each year, culminating in a final battle and the crowning of the Reine or \\"queen\\". Success may significantly increase the market value of cows.

It was the successor to the C-byr√•n and predecessor to IB. T-kontoret was headed by Thede Palm. History In connection with the outbreak of World War II in 1939, a secret intelligence service was established, the G Section (G-sektionen), or the Border Section (Gr√§nssektionen) for surveillance of the Swedish borders and control of migration flows. In 1942 the Defence Staff was heavily reorganized. The coordinators for the intelligence and security service became Section II (from 1966 named Section 2). Section I included the Foreign Department, the Domestic Department and the G Section, which now changed its name to C-byr√•n or Centralen. In 1946 it was again time for a new reorganization. The Foreign Department had now two subdivisions, the Intelligence and Attach√© Offices. C-byr√•n was disbanded. Operations had become too well known, and its methods had been strongly disputed. A new secret organization was created, T-kontoret, headed by former C-byr√•n employee, the former librarian at Lund University Library, PhD Thede Palm. The operations were entirely focused on foreign intelligence gathering. For a secret domestic intelligence gathering, Grupp B (\\"Group B\\") was organized in 1957, later known as B-kontoret (\\"B office\\") within the Domestic Department. Within the agency a department was created, called Detalj II for east-economic research. To the Detalj II, bankers and economists as Torsten G√•rdlund, Lars-Erik Thunholm and Gunnar Dahm√©n were linked. The operations came from the 1950s to be headed by Jan Rydstr√∂m, also a former employee of C-byr√•n. After a schism between Thede Palm and Jan Rydstr√∂m, Detalj II was split from T-kontoret. The East Economic Agency Foundation (Stiftelsen √ñst Ekonomiska Byr√•n) was established with Jan Rydstr√∂m as head. From 1961, the T-kontoret constituted a separate department within the Defence Staff/Section II (Fst/Sekt II), alongside the Domestic Department (Fst/In), the Foreign Department (Fst/U) and Group B (Grupp B). Group B was the unit for domestic intelligence which was formed in 1957-58. In the summer of 1961, the Group B was organizationally separated from the Fst/In and received independent status directly under the chief of Fst/Sekt II. In 1965 the T-kontoret was merged with Group B into a single secret organization known as IB. Palm was fired the year before and head of the merged entity was Birger Elm√©r, the former head of Group B.

Personal life William Pettigrew was born at Edinburgh, in Scotland on January 5, 1869. After his mother died at childbirth of his younger brother, his father who worked as Captain in an Irish Ship remarried, and add two more brothers and one sister to the family. Pettigrew siblings were brought up in a strict Anglican religion, where the children attended Bible Camp every week. During one of such visit, Pettigrew heard about the first American Missionary Adoniram Judson working as a Christian Missionary in Burma (now Myanmmar). Inspired by this story, Pettigrew was convinced that he will become a Missionary and spread Christianity in India. To fulfil this desire, he underwent aboriginal training after completing High School at the Ardington Aborigines Training Centre. He was certified to go to India as Christian Missionary on 28 November 1890, and arrived in India at Calcutta with three other Missionaries and one Doctor during the same year. Pettigrew later married his high school sweetheart Alice Goreham on 13 November 1896, at Calcutta, and they lived in India till 1933 before they depart for England. Missionary work in India From his arrival till 1894, Pettigrew worked with the Ardington Aborigines Missionary group, but from 1894, he started to work with the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society (ABFMS), after he converted from the Anglican to Baptist faith in India. When he finally started working in Manipur, Pettigrew therefore worked as a Baptist Missionary. He was given an official approval by the Political Agent of Manipur of the then British-India, Major Maxwell in 1894, to work as Christian Missionary at Ukhrul -one of the hilly regions of Manipur. The order from the Political Agent for William Pettigrew to work among the head hunting Tangkhul-Naga tribe living at Ukhrul came in such manner: \\"Confined and restricted to one section of the country, the North-East area among the Tangkhul Nagas, Headquarters of the past and still practiced in the outlying and frontier villages, the writer and his wife at their own risk according to Government order from 1896 to 1918 made the largest and most important village of the tribe Ukhrul, their headquarters\\". Pettigrew started his work as an Educationist at the Ukhrul Headquarter, Hunphun, on 19 February 1897, when 20 students enrolled to learn rudimentary western education. He also learned Tangkhul dialect from the Hunphun Chief Raihao Hunphun Awungshi, which was followed by writing Tangkhul primers, arithmetic, and catechism in Roman script, and finally translating the English Bible into Tangkhul dialect. From Ukhrul Headquarter, Hunphun, education and setting up of schools swiftly spread to the surrounding villages including Humbum (Hungpung), Talla (Talloi), Faling (Halang), Paoyi (Peh), Chingjui (Chingjaroi), Phadang (Phalee), Somdal, Horton, Longpi (Nungbi), Khangkhui, and Nambisha. These villages with their schools were structured under 'single teacher school' system. By 1897, the Manipur State Government also started to award the students with stipend cum scholarship of 3 Rupees, in order to encourage them towards education. Imparting western education was followed by converting 12 Tangkhuls from their primal religion of nature-worshiping to Christianity on 29 September 1901. This day is regarded as the day, Phungyo Baptist Church, the first Church of Manipur, was born in the State. Thereafter, Christianity grew at a rapid rate, leading to the entire conversion of the Tangkhul Nagas into Christianity in the process.

The Renaissance building is a three-winged country house with 4 mid-16th century corner towers and the remains of an enceinte.  History  The village is first recorded in 1062 in connexion with the royal palace (K√∂nigshof) in Forchheim. The lords of Wiesenthau appear from 1128 onwards as ministeriales of the Bishopric of Bamberg. Whether at that time a castle already existed is not clear. The castle itself is first recorded in 1379. Originally an allodial possession of the lords of Wiesenthau, on 25 June 1379 part of the castle was sold to the Bishopric. In the period that followed the whole castle became a fief of Bamberg. The lords of Wiesenthau remained, however, in charge of the castle as Bamberg vassals. In 1430 the castle was badly damaged by the Hussites. It suffered destruction again in 1525 during the Peasants' War. In 1566 it was fully rebuilt. Apart from a short period of time, the castle, or at least a part of it, was continuously owned by the lords of Wiesenthau until they died out in 1814. After a comprehensive renovation lasting from 1985 to 1992, the castle became an inn and hotel.

She served as Superintendent of the Franchise department of the World's Woman's Christian Temperance Union. She was actively associated with the Woman's Liberal Federation, and was the Vice-President of the National British Women's Temperance Association. In this capacity, she presided over and lead the white ribbon forces in England when the President, Lady Henry Somerset, was absent from the post. McLaren was superintendent of the department for work among municipal women voters; was an authority on parliamentary drill, as well as rules and procedure in debate; wrote leaflets on the subject of \\"The Duties of Women on Parish and District Councils\\"; and had the cause of woman's franchise greatly at heart. She was also a fine speaker. Her husband, Walter McLaren, M. P., was a nephew of John Bright and one of the chief champions of woman's cause in the British Parliament. Early years Eva Maria M√ºller was born in 1852. She was the younger daughter of German businessman William M√ºller, and his English wife, Maria Henrietta. One of Eva's sisters, Henrietta M√ºller, was also a notable suffragist. She spent her early life in Valpara√≠so, Chile, before the family moved to London, living in Portland Place. Career McLaren's mother had progressive political views and introduced Eva to Octavia Hill for whom she collected rents and managed tenant welfare in Marylebone. She later trained as a nurse at Brownlow Hill infirmary in Liverpool. In 1881, she was a co-founder of Society for Promoting the Return of Women as Poor Law Guardians, a fore-runner of the Society for Promoting the Return of Women as County Councillors (1888) which eventually (1893) became the Women's Local Government Society. On 18 April 1883, at the Meeting House in St Martin's Lane, Westminster, she married politician Walter McLaren (1853‚Äì1912), whose mother, Priscilla Bright McLaren (1815‚Äì1906), was president of the Edinburgh National Society for Women's Suffrage. Walter McLaren also supported women's suffrage and the couple joined the Manchester Society for Women's Suffrage in 1884. In the 1886 General Election, Walter McLaren was elected as the Liberal Party MP for Crewe. As one of the few MPs supporting votes for women, he served as joint secretary of the all-party committee of the Parliamentary Supporters of the Women's Franchise Bill. McLaren joined the central committee of the National Society for Women's Suffrage, became a leading member of the Women's Liberal Federation, and was active in the Union of Practical Suffragists, the Forward Suffrage Union (which she founded in 1908 with Marie Corbett and Frances Heron Maxwell as a focus for women's suffrage efforts inside the Liberal Party and through the WLF),Peter Gordon, David Doughan, Dictionary of British Women‚Äôs Organisations, 1825-1960; Woburn Press, 2001 p54 and the Liberal Women's Suffrage Union.

Released worldwide on December 1, 2017, it is the third installment in the Xenoblade Chronicles series, and the seventh main entry in the Xeno meta series; although it features a different setting and characters than the first Xenoblade Chronicles, it marks a return to a story-driven game, unlike the previous game in the series, Xenoblade Chronicles X, which was oriented towards open world exploration. Xenoblade Chronicles 2 takes place in Alrest, a world covered in a sea of clouds. Humans live on top of and inside living creatures known as Titans, together with Blades, powerful beings that can be summoned by certain humans named Drivers, and to whom they are tied for the rest of the Driver's life. After he is hired for a salvaging mission, a young Driver named Rex is killed, but revived by a legendary Blade named Pyra on the promise of taking her to Elysium, a fabled paradise at the top of the World Tree. Together with other Drivers and Blades, the duo, caught in a war between countries, attempts to reach the World Tree, while being chased by Torna, an elusive faction seeking to capture Pyra. Development of Xenoblade Chronicles 2 began shortly before the launch of Xenoblade Chronicles X. Several key people from previous Xenoblade Chronicles games returned including franchise creator, executive director and co-writer Tetsuya Takahashi and directors Koh Kojima and Genki Yokota. Using their experience from X, the team wanted to develop a story-driven game in the style of the original Xenoblade Chronicles. The soundtrack was composed and arranged by Yasunori Mitsuda, ACE, Kenji Hiramatsu, and Manami Kiyota. The main characters were drawn by Masatsugu Saito, best known for his work in Expelled from Paradise, while Tetsuya Nomura designed the characters of Torna; many guest artists were hired to design the Blades unrelated to the main story. Gameplay-wise, Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is similar to previous entries, with the notable addition of the Blades, three of whom the player can switch between during a battle; most Blades in the game are optional, and must be \\"awakened\\" from a Core Crystal, resulting in a randomly selected Blade becoming tied to a specific Driver, who can use them in combat. The game was first announced alongside the Nintendo Switch reveal presentation in 2017, with a worldwide release date planned for the same year. Similarly to the original Xenoblade Chronicles, the game's localization was handled by Nintendo of Europe. Unlike the controversy surrounding Xenoblade Chronicles X, the game does not feature any sort of censorship between different versions. Upon release the game received generally positive reviews, with most praise going to its story, combat, music, environments, and amount of content. At over 1.7 million copies sold as of June 2019, it is the best- selling title in the Xeno series, and Monolith Soft's most commercially successful game. A large story-based downloadable content (DLC) addition taking place 500 years before the main game and featuring its own game mechanics, titled Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Torna ‚Äì The Golden Country, was released in September 2018.  Gameplay  Akin to previous Xenoblade games, Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is an action role-playing game (ARPG) where the player controls a main character out of a party of three. The game employs an open world design, with a day-and-night time cycle that often affects in-game events, including quests, enemy strength, and item availability. Unlike previous entries Xenoblade Chronicles & Xenoblade Chronicles X, which consisted of a cohesive open world through which player could journey uninterrupted, the game takes place on several Titans, between whom the player travels via a Fast Travel option. The biggest change to gameplay mechanics comes from Blades, sentient beings summoned from \\"Core Crystals\\" who provide their summoners - called Drivers - weapons in combat and make up the player's party (separate from the character party). Each character can only have three Blades active at a time. The Blade equipped on a Driver determines their class, and Blade weapon types are divided into three main categories: Attacker, Healer, and Tank. Blades support their Driver in the form of buffs and special attacks performed by both a Driver and their Blade. Buffs and other upgrades can be unlocked through a Blade's Affinity Chart. A Blade is tied to their Driver, and cannot usually be used by another; however, a rare item called the Overdrive Protocol allows the player to change a Blade's affiliated Driver. There are a total of 40 distinctly unique \\"rare\\" blades to collect throughout the base game with an additional 11 being obtainable either through DLC packs or New Game Plus in later patches. Each Driver has a Blade automatically assigned to them when they join the party, who are also a part of the game's story. Most of the game's Blades are not a part of the main story, and can be assigned to any Driver; among those is KOS-MOS from the Xeno sub-series Xenosaga.  Synopsis   Setting  The game is set in Alrest, which has no continental landmasses, but instead is made of a sea topped with clouds, called the \\"Cloud Sea\\" and inhabited by massive creatures known as titans on which smaller creatures reside. Legends claim humanity once lived atop the World Tree in a paradise called Elysium with their creator, the Architect, but they were exiled for unknown reasons and given the Titans to live on. Blades are powerful beings summoned from \\"Core Crystals\\" who channel power into their weapons through a force called ether. Their masters are called Drivers; when a Driver dies, their Blade reverts to a Core Crystal and loses their memory. After some time, another Driver can awaken them so long as the crystal is intact. At the game's start, the nation-states of Mor Ardain and Uraya are on the brink of war.  Plot  Rex, an orphaned salvager who collects treasure from below the Cloud Sea for money, is hired by Argentum Trade Guild Chairman Bana to aid the Drivers Jin, Malos, and Nia, part of a group named Torna, in the salvage of an ancient ship. In the ship, they find Pyra, a legendary Blade known as an Aegis. When Rex reaches out to touch Pyra's sword, Jin fatally stabs him. Rex awakens on a field with Pyra, who reveals they are in a memory of her old home Elysium. She asks him to bring her to Elysium and in exchange gives him half of her Core Crystal to revive him. With help from his Titan companion Azurda (whom Rex calls \\"Gramps\\") and Nia, who has defected from Torna, Rex escapes to the Titan Gormott, but Azurda is wounded and reverts to his larval stage. Soon after, they arrive in Gormott's capital Torigoth and are joined by the Nopon Driver Tora and his artificial Blade Poppi. The group try to get to the World Tree, but are stopped by the Artifice Ophion and swallowed by the Titan Uraya. After the group battles the mercenary Driver Vandham while escaping Uraya's stomach, he joins the party and Rex begins to look to him as a mentor. The group later learns that Jin and Malos are the leaders of Torna, a terrorist group named after a Titan destroyed in the Aegis War 500 years ago. Led by Jin (John Schwab), who is revealed to have fought against Malos 500 years ago, and Malos, later revealed as an Aegis, they seek to destroy humanity by unleashing the Artifice Aion on the World Tree and killing the Architect. During a battle with Malos and fellow Torna member; Akhos, Vandham is killed and Pyra unveils her true form Mythra. They have shared memory and consider themselves sisters, switching back and forth as needed. The group's search for a way past Ophion leads them to join forces with M√≤rag, the Ardainian emperor Niall's elder sister; and Zeke, prince of Tantal on the Titan Genbu. Malos's Driver Amalthus later summons the party to Indol, which controls Core Crystal distribution. After Amalthus attempts peace talks between Uraya and Mor Ardain, the group stops Bana's attempt to kill Niall. Later on, in Tantal, the group battles Jin, who forces Pyra to surrender. While Azurda leads the group to the third Aegis sword to save Pyra, Malos siphons Pyra's power to regain his full strength. After the group finds the third sword, phantoms of Addam nearly kill Rex. To save him, Nia reveals herself as a Flesh Eater (a Blade made human by devouring his Driver, which every member of Torna except Malos is), and Addam's spirit deems Rex worthy of the third sword. The group confronts Jin and Malos at the Cliffs of Morytha near the World Tree, during which Rex unlocks Pyra and Mythra's true form Pneuma. Rex, now matched with Jin's power, forces Malos to summon Ophion, who knocks the group into the abyss beneath the World Tree. In the Land of Morytha, under the Cloud Sea, the group is forced to work with a weakened Jin. Soon after, Amalthus, revealed to be just as bent on wiping out humanity and the reason for Malos' malicious nature, attacks the World Tree by controlling various Titans. The group severs his connection to the Titans, only for him to kill all Torna members except Malos and Jin, the latter of which defeats him before dying redeemed. The group arrives in Elysium and meet the Architect, a scientist named Klaus. He explains that, long ago, he discovered a device called the Conduit that sends objects into different dimensions, the use of which split his body in two and destroyed the old world. Sensing that his other half is about to die, which will result in his own death, Klaus sends the group to stop Malos, who has obtained Aion. After Malos's defeat and death, Klaus dies, but not before granting Rex and the party \\"one final gift.\\" Klaus's death causes the Conduit to shut off; without the Conduit, the World Tree begins to crumble, which will destroy Alrest. Pneuma helps the group escape, but sacrifices herself to detonate the World Tree. The group barely survives when Azurda, thanks to Pneuma, returns to his adult form and flies everyone down to Alrest. As part of Klaus's \\"last gift\\", the Cloud Sea fades to reveal a new world and the Titans merge to form a new landmass. Afterwards, Pyra and Mythra are revived in separate bodies and reunite with Rex.  Development  The game is the third title in Monolith Soft's Xenoblade Chronicles series, following the original Xenoblade Chronicles and Xenoblade Chronicles X. Plans for the game began as early as July 2014, during the latter half of development of Xenoblade Chronicles X, out of the negative fan reaction from changes implemented in the title. While the original Xenoblade Chronicles followed the typical structure of a general story-driven JRPG, Xenoblade Chronicles X received far less emphasis on story, and was organized in more of a mission-based structure, focused primarily on exploring the game's massive open world. The development grew impatient upon hearing the fanbase complain about the changes, and started work on another story-driven title. Because the gameplay was more of a continuation of the first title, they decided to title it Xenoblade Chronicles 2. Initial work on the game was difficult because the technical specifications of the Nintendo Switch were not yet finalized or known yet, but once it was finalized, the game featured a shorter development period compared to the prior titles, with executive director Tetsuya Takahashi citing being able to use the technological foundation established in Xenoblade Chronicles X as a means of speeding up development time. Another motivating factor was the agreement made by the team with Nintendo specifically to deliver the game early on in the Nintendo Switch's lifecycle. One of Monolith Soft's objectives for the game was to give the characters a wider range of facial expressions compared to past Xenoblade titles. The lead character designer was Masatsugu Saito, who for the first time was designing characters for a video game. The developers chose him to give the protagonists a more expressive anime-like art style than prior Xenoblade entries, which featured a more realistic type of modeling that they found a bit too stiff. Square Enix artist Tetsuya Nomura was responsible for the characters within the Torna organization. Takahashi had always wanted to work with Nomura, but as he was busy with other games at Square Enix, he hesitantly approached the company with the hopes of letting him work as a guest artist. To Takahashi's surprise, they accepted the negotiation. Other guest artists also contributed, such as Xeno series veterans Kunihiko Tanaka and Soraya Saga, who designed some of the game's \\"Blades\\", weapon-like life forms. Notably, Tanaka designed a blade of KOS-MOS, one of the protagonists of the Xenosaga trilogy. The game's story was conceived by Takahashi, with assistance from screenwriters Yuichiro Takeda and Kazuho Hyodo, who respectively worked on the even and odd chapters. Takeda, who also worked as a writer on the last two Xenoblade games, stated that the writing techniques and workflow for Xenoblade Chronicles 2 was similar to that of a movie. Takeda also stated that the story had the most \\"Tetsuya Takahashi flair to date\\". While it is a sequel to Xenoblade Chronicles, it features a new world and cast of characters. The game was announced in January 2017 as part of Nintendo's detailed reveal of the Nintendo Switch, with a gameplay trailer being released on the same day. Similar to the original Xenoblade, the title was announced as Xenoblade 2 in Japan, but had Chronicles added to its name in English speaking regions. The game was also a part of Nintendo's presentation at E3 2017, where it was reconfirmed for release by the end of 2017. Like the original Xenoblade Chronicles, Nintendo's European division took up the reins for the English localization, who regularly communicated with Nintendo's Japanese and American divisions about decisions that could prove controversial, something that was previously an issue with Xenoblade Chronicles X. The game had a simultaneous worldwide launch on December 1, 2017, as the localization process took place during development rather than after it, unlike the first two games.  Torna ‚Äì The Golden Country  Additional story-based downloadable content was made for the game, with the first being Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Torna ‚Äì The Golden Country. The content was released digitally as part of the game's expansion pass on September 14, 2018, and as a standalone retail release a week later.  Music  Composition of the game's soundtrack was led by Yasunori Mitsuda The game's original score was written by Yasunori Mitsuda, ACE (Tomori Kudo and Hiroyo \\"Chico\\" Yamanaka), Kenji Hiramatsu, and Manami Kiyota. Mitsuda, who was also in charge of the audio budget, musician booking, schedule management, and music sheet proofreading, was first invited to the project by Takahashi in December 2014. Throughout the following year, Mitsuda and Takahashi held numerous meetings discussing the overall direction of the music, eventually inviting musical group ACE and Kenji Hiramatsu, who had also worked on the first Xenoblade Chronicles. At the meetings, each composer's contribution to the soundtrack was decided, with ACE primarily handling the field music, and Hiramatsu handling the battle music. According to Mitsuda, it was done in a way that would satisfy the fans, as they did not want to \\"ruin the image\\" that was set by the first Xenoblade Chronicles. With contributions from over 300 total musicians and 20,000 sheets worth of music, Mitsuda considered it the largest project he had ever worked on, with files and data from Pro Tools, his music production software, surpassing one terabyte in size. Overall, there were approximately 120 tracks recorded for the game, with around 25 of them being from Mitsuda. The soundtrack features performances from the Slovakian Bratislava Symphony Choir, as well as the Irish chamber choir An√∫na. Mitsuda, who had always wanted to work with An√∫na after becoming a fan of theirs in the 1990s, claimed that their performances for the game made him cry. Two tracks, including the ending theme written by Mitsuda, were sung by Jennifer Bird of the English acoustic duo Tomorrow Bird. Before recording, Mitsuda and Bird corresponded so that she could properly convey the characters' emotions through her singing. While recording, Bird was able to improvise melodic elements of her singing, something that did not usually happen with Mitsuda's arrangements. Days before the game's launch, a promotional music video featuring a vocal track from the game by Mitsuda, \\"Shadow of the Lowlands\\", was uploaded onto Nintendo's official YouTube accounts. The video features a performance by An√∫na, and was filmed and directed by Michael McGlynn, leader of the group. An official soundtrack, consisting of over a hundred tracks, was released in both physical and digital formats on May 23, 2018.  Reception   Pre-release  Xenoblade Chronicles 2 was positively received upon announcement, with some critics calling its reveal \\"unexpected\\". Jeremy Parish of USGamer favorably compared it to Chrono Cross. At the Gamescom event in August 2017, the game received positive early hands-on impressions from gaming sites, being praised for its streamlined combat system and environments.  Reviews  Upon release, Xenoblade Chronicles 2 received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to review aggregator Metacritic, which gave it an overall score of 83 out of 100 based on 93 reviews. The game's story, characters, complex combat system, soundtrack, amount of content, and the beauty and size of the environments were largely praised, although some criticized its technical issues. John Rairdin of Nintendo World Report gave a 9.5 rating out of 10 considered the game \\"one of the finest JRPGs of the generation and perhaps of all time\\" and highly praising the music, \\"diverse world\\", \\"fresh and engaging combat\\", and \\"thrilling storyline\\", stating: \\"Washing over any minor issues is one of the most engaging stories I‚Äôve ever played, a vastly improved and fun combat system, and an out-of-this-world soundtrack. It sets a precedent for JRPGs on the Switch that I doubt will be topped.\\" IGN Japan gave a very positive review, stating that it \\"offers a timeless tale of adventure and an incredibly deep battle system.\\" However, they criticized the fact that \\"its mechanics are not always well explained\\". The game received a 35/40 review score from Famitsu. Nadia Oxford of USgamer stated that Xenoblade Chronicles 2 \\"captures nearly everything that made the first game great, borrows the best elements from Chronicles X, and then improves on much of it. Though Blades change up how you fight in Chronicles 2, the game spills over with the traits that make the first Chronicles game a stand-out experience. More story, more enemies to scrap with, more landscapes to tread across. Chronicles 2 is a dialogue-heavy game, but there are many points where Monolith Soft lets its environments narrate the seriousness of Alrest's plight.\\" She highly praised the game's story, stating \\"The narrative explores patriotism, war, environmental decline, refugees, and examines the little people who get caught in the crush when big powers scrap with one another. There are also a number of moral and philosophical questions raised about Blades [...] Are Blades humanity's partners, or their slaves?\\" Leif Johnson of IGN praised the game, awarding it a score of 8.5 out of 10. They called it a \\"standout RPG that manages to keep its story, combat, and exploration interesting over the course of at least 70 hours of adventure through an impressively varied and rich world\\", though conceded a few frustrations with the game, including a confusing minimap that sometimes led to the reviewer getting lost. Shubhankar Parijat of GamingBolt called it \\"\\"A must-play for all Nintendo Switch owners\\"\\" and \\"one of the best JRPGs of this generation\\" and calling its world \\"vast and beautiful\\", its story \\"complex and layered\\", and its combat \\"intricate and addictive\\", while also noting that the game was occasionally held back by \\"obtuse design choices\\" and \\"a simple lack of polish\\". Conversely, Jason Schreier of Kotaku, who had also disliked the original Xenoblade Chronicles, gave a largely negative review, calling the game \\"dull, dreary, overly complicated, and unconcerned with wasting the player's time\\", and heavily criticizing the writing, technical issues, pacing, as well as the gameplay, which he considered overly extensive and complicated, and the game content he judged excessively huge. He stated: \\"Xenoblade 2 consistently displays a frustrating lack of respect for the player‚Äôs time. Everything takes significantly longer than it needs to, in part because the game contains such an overwhelming number of features. It can take dozens of minutes to navigate the clunky menus, sort through all of the characters‚Äô upgrades, and manage a collection of Pok√©mon-like Blades.\\" He was also critical of the story, calling it \\"an unsubtle script that stomps all over even the most interesting story scenes\\". However, he praised the \\"spectacular\\" music and \\"beautifully realized\\" environments.  Sales  The game sold nearly 98,000 copies in its first week in Japan, and 168,000 after a month. In the United Kingdom, the game positioned itself at number 19 overall in its first week, which made it debut 9 places higher over Xenoblade Chronicles X. In the United States, it charted at number 16 for the month of December. Within a month, the game had sold over a million copies worldwide. By the end of 2018, it had sold over 213,000 units in Japan, making it the 75th best- selling game 2018 in the country. By April 2018, Xenoblade Chronicles 2 had become the best selling game in the Xeno franchise, and the best-selling game of Monolith Soft altogether. In September 2018, Takahashi stated: \\"From a sales perspective, I have to say Xenoblade Chronicles 2 exceeded my expectations. We really saw more people pick the game up and experience it in the North American and European territories than we thought would do so. It's still early days for the Torna DLC, but from what we've seen in Japan, the sales of the Torna DLC are exceeding our expectations as well.\\" In an interview with 4Gamer, Takahashi revealed that Xenoblade Chronicles 2 has sold 1.73 million units worldwide as of March 2019.  Awards and nominations  The game was nominated for \\"Best RPG\\" at IGN's Best of 2017 Awards. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\\" style=\\"width: 50%;\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" Award ! scope=\\"col\\" Category ! scope=\\"col\\" Result ! scope=\\"col\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" Japan Game Awards  Award for Excellence   style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers Awards  Game Engineering   style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" Famitsu Awards  Excellence Prize   style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  }  Legacy  Characters from Xenoblade Chronicles 2 were considered for a position as a playable fighter in Super Smash Bros.

He died in Zhengding, Hebei, China while attempting to protect the local population during the Sino-Japanese war.  Early life  Schraven was born in Lottum in the province of Limburg. He was educated at the Episcopal College in Roermond and was ordained priest in Paris in May 1899. The same year of his ordination he followed his calling as missionary in China. On 10 April 1921 he was made Bishop in the city of Zhengding.  Death  The Second Sino-Japanese war broke out in September 1931. As the Imperial Japanese troops progressed through Eastern China, they reached Zhengding as part of the full-scale invasion in 1937. Around 5,000 local residents, including 200 young women, sought refuge with the Catholic priests from the advancing army. It is thought that the young women were at risk of being taken away of comfort women for the soldiers. Schraven resisted the Japanese troops. When confronted by Japanese soldiers he allegedly responded by saying, \\"You can kill me if you want but you will never get what you ask for\\". He and his fellow 8 priests were subsequently kidnapped and burned alive.  Alternative account  The Japanese historical revisionist organization, Society for the Dissemination of Historical Fact, questions the murder of the priest by Japanese soldiers. They dismiss accusations of the crime as propaganda, citing that there had been no houses for comfort women in the area at the time. Correspondence between the Japanese and French embassies in Beijing suggests that Japanese officials rejected responsibility at the time, blaming rogue Chinese forces for their deaths. A memorial was erected for the deaths of the priests without accepting responsibility.  Legacy  In 2013, Frans Wiertz, Bishop of Roermond, initiated proceeding for the beatification of Frans Schraven for his martyrdom. Document have been passed to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome in 2014 as part of the process. There have been calls for the canonisation of Schraven as the patron saint for sex abuse victims. In 2016, the Schraven Path was opened, a 10 km walk way in his home town of Lottum, connecting his birthplace and local chapels.

First developed in 1836, it was the last water-powered mill to operate on the Stevens River, lasting into the late 20th century. The property, which includes an original mill dam and a surviving 1872 mill building, as well as archaeological sites of other industrial buildings, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. It is now styled Ben's Mill, and is a local museum. Description and history The Thresher Mill is located in a rural setting a short way west of Barnet Center, between the Stevens River to the north and West Barnet Road to the south. The only visible elements of the complex are the main mill building and the breached crib dam spanning the river. The mill building consists of a 2-1/2-story wood frame main block, with added single-story elements on either side. It is covered by a metal roof and finished in wooden clapboards. The dam extends northward from the building across the river; it is built mainly out of planking and logs. North and south of the mill are the remnant sites of several barns and a tannery. with The industrial history of the site begins in 1836, when the land and water rights were purchased by Benjamin Carrick, who built a log cabin on the site. Carrick also built a stone dam (portions of which still survive above the wooden dam), and began operating a sawmill and tannery. The site was abandoned sometime after 1850, and was restarted in the early 1870s by Alexander Jack, who built the core of the current dam and the surviving mill building. Jack operated a variety of industrial businesses, including dying, machining, and blacksmithing on the site. A water turbine was installed on the site in the early 20th century, and was an early provider of electrical power to the village of Barnet. The property was owned by Ben Thresher from 1947 until his death in 1994, and at that time included operational water-powered machine equipment and infrastructure. In 1982 Ben's Mill, a documentary film, was released and nominated for an Academy Award.

They were randomly assigned to receive interventions with intensive education to one of three diets: # Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil. # Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts. # Control diet encouraging low-fat food items. The trial was planned for six years, but it was terminated early after a median follow-up of 4.8 years, and demonstrated that both Mediterranean diet groups reached a statistically significant reduction in the rate of the composite cardiovascular primary end-point of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death. This article has been retracted \\"[b]ecause of irregularities in the randomization procedures\\". Retraction and Republication: Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet. N Engl J Med 2013;368:1279-90. This corresponded to an absolute reduction in 3 less cardiovascular events per 1000 patient-years, or a 30% relative risk reduction. Other important observed benefits included a strong reduction in peripheral artery disease, breast cancer, and atrial fibrillation (only associated with the consumption of extra-virgin olive oil).  Criticisms  Some criticisms included that the protocol for the low-fat control group was changed during the trial, there were losses to follow up in the low-fat group which may have biased the results and, very specially, that a true low-fat diet was not achieved by the control group. Additionally, participants lived in a Mediterranean country. Thus, it is unclear if the results will be applicable to other non-Mediterranean settings. Despite these criticisms, there is no other dietary pattern with such a strong evidence of cardiovascular benefit, supported by this major trial and by the Lyon Diet- Heart Study but also reinforced by a multitude of other large and well- conducted observational studies. The transferability of the Mediterranean diet to other geographical regions far from the Mediterranean Sea represents the next main challenges. Arnav Agarwal and John Ioannidis note that \\"[r]epublication may not solve multiple problems that remain, including the inappropriateness of stopping early given the revised results and the effects on over 200 secondary publications [and] [m]ultiple contradictions between data reported across PREDIMED publications suggest a more generic problem with the trial‚Äôs quality\\".

The castle was built in the late 14th century. After comprehensive archaeological and architectural- historical investigation it has become one of the best researched castles of this period in Central Europe. Today it houses the Archaeological Museum of Upper Franconia. The oldest part of the castle is in the west wing where the cabinet (Kemenate) of the Schulthei√ü has survived, a room which was built onto the old town wall in 1339.  Site of the early medieval Kaiserpfalz?  From the 9th to the early 11th centuries there was a Frankish royal court (K√∂nigshof) and a palace (Pfalz) in Forchheim (see the history of Forchheim). Its exact location is, however, not known. In the late 19th century it was thought to be on the site of the episcopal urban castle, which was also referred to as the Pfalz (\\"palace\\") or Kaiserpfalz (\\"imperial palace\\"). However, archaeological investigations carried out during the renovation of the castle from 1998 to 2004 uncovered no remains of an early medieval settlement at all. Nevertheless even in recent literature by Tillman Kohnert (2008), the Pfalz is still seen as the direct predecessor to the episcopal castle. And the castle still retains the name of Kaiserpfalz, a name which has been adopted for decades and is used as the official name of the castle.  The castle around 1400  From the late 14th century the bishops of Bamberg, especially Bishop Lambert of Buren, built an urban castle that became their most important residence outside of the immunity of Bamberg Cathedral. The centrepiece of the castle is the so-called Great Cabinet (Gro√üe Kemenate), the former residence, which was built in the east of the castle from 1391. In the cabinet an extensive stone chamber forced-air heating system has survived. Of great art-historical significance are the Gothic murals, some of which are even by Bohemian masters. The bastion by the Saltor Tower, northwest of the castle. In the background is the Saltor Tower, a relic of the medieval town fortifications An Osterbrunnen (Easter Fountain) in front of the castle  Description   Exterior  The almost square castle site is surrounded by moats. Until around 1550 the fortress at the northwest corner of the town was incorporated into the town fortifications. North of the castle, is the only surviving medieval town gate, the Saltor Tower (Saltorturm). In the 16th century a modern bastioned fortification, based on Italian designs, was constructed in front of the remains of the medieval town wall. North and west of the castle district, two large casemated \\"Old Italian\\" bastions escaped the fate of demolition that other parts of Forchheim Fortress suffered in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Large parts of the main house and the courtyard buildings go back to the 14th century. The eastern part of the main house is joined to the courtyard buildings on the west side by walls and timber-framed passageways. The two upper storeys of the northwest wing have also been executed in a simple, timber-framed style as far as the castle courtyard. In the middle of the 16th century the urban castle was remodelled. It was at that time that the picturesque, timber-framed walkways on the curtain walls were constructed. In 1603 work began on building an octagonal staircase tower in front of the four-storey main house. The mighty half-hipped roof of the main house dates to the 18th century. Originally the east wing was covered by a gable roof with crow-stepped gables. Since 1768/69 a sandstone bridge has spanned the moat in front of the gateway on the south side. Previously access had been protected by a drawbridge. Next to it, a rectangular Renaissance oriel with a shed roof enhances the architectural impression. The rather austere south front of the ensemble is brought to life mainly by the timber framing (Sichtfachwerk) above the gateway. A typical Franconian motif is the frieze made of numerous, small curved St. Andrew's crosses underneath the window area. On the east fa√ßade of the main wing are three reliefs depicting coats of arms. On the second storey is the official coat of arms of Prince- Bishop John Philip of Gebsattel. The third storey bears the coat of arms of Bishop Lamprecht of Brunn and the Hochstift. A high medieval sculpture of a basilisk has been engraved into the south wall; it has been dated to the 12th century. The addition of a modern, steel and glass staircase and lift tower in the north of the east wing has been highly controversial. This feature was needed to turn the castle into a museum.  Interior rooms  = East Wing = The East Wing of the castle is divided into two parts by a transverse wall running the width of the building. The north part is somewhat larger than the south part. The barrel-roofed cellar goes back to the 14th century. The ceilings of the two halls on the ground floor are borne on sandstone columns. The flat ceiling of the north room rests on a round column and a wooden beam. The south part was vaulted later, resulting in a twin-aisled hall comprising four bays that are covered by cross vaults. In former times a passageway led from here to St. Mary's Chapel. On the walls of the hall fragments of fresco- secco (painting on dry plaster) from the period around 1400 have survived, which are stylistically related to contemporary Bohemian art. A fragment shows the Biblical and historical figure of King David of ancient Israel. Like the murals in the other halls these paintings are among the most important Gothic murals in South Germany. The chapel was originally located in the southern part of the first floor. The vaulting was done in the early modern period; and the hall was divided by an internal dividing wall. The murals of the old chapel have survived and indicate its original function and arrangement. It includes depictions of the prophets, the Adoration of the Magi, the Annunciation and the Last Judgement. Two paintings with secular content have been interpreted by H. Kehrer as referring to the weak king, Wenceslaus. The paintings were clearly done by different masters. The Adoration of the Magi, again, appears to be derived from the field of Bohemian art. The Last Judgement, by contrast, is in the latest Forchheim style, which was derived from the Nuremberg art of the early 15th century. The northern hall, like that on the ground floor, is covered by a flat ceiling which, however, rests on wooden beams. On the second floor of the northern end of the wing is also a twin-aisled, flat-ceiling hall with a wooden centre beam. The architectural paintings were done by Jakob Ziegler in the years 1559/60. The south room is likewise a two-aisled hall. The flat ceiling is supported on an octagonal centre frame. The murals, of various themes, were also created by Jakob Ziegler. One of the paintings shows Saints Henry II and Cunigunde with the model of Bamberg Cathedral (drawn in 1599, south wall). The third floor was conceived as a storage area and currently serves as a museum depot. The old staircase tower hides a stone circular staircase which opens into the northern part of the east wing. = West Wing = The West Wing, the former side wing, acts as offices for the castle museums. No significant historical interior features have survived here.

Hardesty & Company, publishers, of Chicago and Toledo. A massive work with enormous amount of textual and statistical data, it went through various editions and variations throughout the 1880s, with some special editions focusing on areas of special regional significance. (E.g., a stand-alone military history under the title The Military History of Ohio in special county editions which did not include the more general information in the main Encyclopedia, but included the state‚Äôs general military history in addition to a specific county‚Äôs military history. Another example was the Special Virginia Edition giving a history of the Virginias, written by R.A. Brock, secretary of the Virginia Historical Society.) The main edition of the Encyclopedia contained large scale copper plate maps of each state and territory of the United States; and the provinces of Canada; a reference map of the world; a topographical and railroad map of the United States; thirteen comprehensive maps of Bible geography; a general survey of the world; history of the United States; each state and territory; Declaration of Independence; sketches of the Signers, with portraits; and of Presidents. County editions (typically 2 or 3 counties per volume) include brief county histories and brief biographies of early or pioneering county residents. Hardesty printed about 10,000 copies of main edition, 2,000 copies of the Virginia/West Virginia supplement, and subsequently prepared local historical (county) material for very limited editions of about 250 copies each.

The Fraunhofer IWM is a research and development partner for both industry and public institutions whose themes include the safety, reliability, life expectancy and functionality of materials in components and manufacturing processes. The broad spectrum of services offered by the Fraunhofer IWM's business units aid their clients and project partners in the assessment and continuing development of highly stressed materials and components and in the optimization of production process. Established in 1971 in Freiburg in Breisgau, the institute expanded in 1992 to include a location in Halle (Saale). On 1 January 2016 the Halle division of the Fraunhofer IWM became the Fraunhofer Institute for Microstructure of materials and Systems IMWS.  Competencies Mechanics of Materials at the Fraunhofer IWM address all issues concerning functionality, behavior and the specific properties of materials from the development stage through manufacture, processing and application. Via the material-mechanical expertise of the scientists at the institute, the properties, functionality and stress limitations of materials and components are assessed, adjusted and improved as per specific requirements set forth by their clients. This in- depth know-how lies within situations in which complex and extreme load conditions exist for materials in components and manufacturing processes as well as in performance and efficiency improvements that can only be achieved through a holistic understanding of the various aspects involved. The interaction between experimentation and simulations yields solutions to materials-related issues for nearly all industry sectors. The scientific, technical ‚Äútools‚Äù that make up the core competencies of the institute consist of:  Material and component characterization  The Fraunhofer IWM characterizes and assesses material properties within components and production processes as well as the behavior of components across several scales and analyzes the development, manufacturing and application of materials and components and offers critical support by realizing new functionalities and processing steps.  Material modeling and simulation  The Fraunhofer IWM develops and employs mechanism-based material models in order to understand and explain the inner structures of material properties. These structural property-relationships have a strong influence both on the manufacturing process and in actual application.  Tribology and surface design  Stress and loads which affect the surfaces of components are analyzed and modified for optimal functionality and performance.  Research Research and development activities at the Fraunhofer IWM are organized into five business units where similar project topics are grouped together in each unit. Pools of experts with the necessary competencies to achieve the desired goal are assembled from the various groups.  Materials Design  Material behavior is explained and material properties are predicted using computational and experimental methods based on solid-state physics and materials mechanics. In this way can material structures, properties, and functions be defined. The effects of crystalline defects and microstructures on the macroscopic behavior of materials are identified, enabling the effective and efficient use of material and energy resources in order to achieve long-term improvements to technical systems.  Manufacturing Processes  A vast understanding of processes and sophisticated simulation techniques enables the design of efficient and safe manufacturing processes. Services include investigations into the technological development of manufacturing processes for the production of semi-finished products and components with functional properties. This work ranges from powder technology processes, including complex fluid systems, to microfluids, the forming and processing of ductile materials as well as processing techniques for brittle materials and glass forming.  Tribology  This business unit carries out research into friction and wear. Tribological systems are optimized and solutions are developed that reduce friction and protect against wear with the aid of technical ceramics, innovative lubricants, tribological layer systems and tribo-materials conditioned for manufacturing technology. Friction, abrasion, running-in and wear mechanisms are investigated as they affect the tribo-chemistry of machine elements such as roller and slide bearings, cutting and forming tools or motor and gear elements. Experimental techniques, multi- scale modeling and numerical simulations as well as microstructure analysis are employed.  Component Safety and Lightweight Construction  This work is centered on the assessment of a component's safety and its fitness for purpose in terms of safety-relevant demands under operational loads. The applications range from proving the safety of power station components to confirming the fault tolerances of aerospace components, the life expectancy analysis of components in power stations and vehicles subjected to thermomechanical loads to crash analyses of vehicle components. The focus is on the operational behavior of modern materials as well as joins and hybrid constructions. Development work is also carried out on mechanism-based material models for a wide range of applications with which to describe the deformation and failure behavior of components under thermal and mechanical loads. Crash analysis increasingly involves determining the influence of the manufacturing process on the failure behavior of vehicle structures.  Assessment of Materials, Lifetime Concepts  The influence of microstructures, internal stresses and damage on component functionality and life expectancy are assessed. Particular interest is paid to linking specific analyses and experiments with advanced material models as well as in understanding the demands placed on components. The work is focused on modeling cyclical thermomechanical loads and on identifying the degradation mechanisms involved in corrosion, stress corrosion cracking and hydrogen embrittlement. In acute cases of damage, the institute can carry out surveys.  Finances and staff  The operating budget is financed through external earnings and institutional funding (core funding). The operating budget for 2019 amounted to 21.7 million euro, of which 36.6% came from industry revenues. The investment budget for 2019 was 2.3 million euro. At the end of 2019 the institute employed 233 permanent staff: 122 scientists, 43 technical staff, 68 infrastructure staff and 9 apprentices. Including the 80 academic assistants as well as interns, the Fraunhofer IWM had 313 employees in 2019.

It is a 2D atmospheric horror side-scroller set in 1960s Taiwan under martial law. The game also incorporates religious elements based on Taiwanese culture and mythology. The game was released on 13 January 2017. A demo version was released on Steam Greenlight on 13 June 2016. The concept of the game originates with the Red Candle Games co-founder Shun-ting \\"Coffee\\" Yao. In February 2017, a novel based on the game was published by novelist Ling Jing. A live action film adaptation distributed by Warner Bros. Taiwan was released on 20 September 2019.  Synopsis  Set in 1960s Taiwan of the White Terror period, students Wei and Ray find themselves trapped and vulnerable in Greenwood High School (Áø†ËèØ‰∏≠Â≠∏) which is located in a remote mountainous area. The place they once knew has changed in unsettling ways, haunted by evil creatures known as the \\"lingered\\" (È≠çÈ≠é). While hiding from the rampaging monsters, the protagonists unveil mysteries which slowly reveal the dark past of the cursed school.  Plot  During the White Terror Period in Taiwan, Greenwood High School junior student Wei Chung-ting (È≠è‰ª≤Âª∑) falls asleep in class as Instructor Bai (ÁôΩÊïôÂÆò) arrives to ask teacher Miss Yin Tsui-han (ÊÆ∑Áø†Ê∂µ) about a certain book list. The scene fades and he awakens to find the campus deserted due to an incoming typhoon. While leaving, he encounters a senior, Fang Ray-shin (ÊñπËäÆÊ¨£), asleep on the auditorium stage. With the school's bridge exit flooded by the river, they decide to wait out the storm in Wei's classroom. Wei leaves to look for a telephone, and the game shifts to Ray waking up in the auditorium again, this time in a nightmarish version of the school with Wei's corpse hanging upside down from the stage ceiling. After performing a ritual where she cuts Wei's throat and collects his blood, Ray wanders the rest of the school, avoiding different kinds of ghosts, solving puzzles and finding clues, as her story is slowly pieced together. Ray was once a bright student but developed depression due to problems at home. The school notices her falling grades and sends her to speak with the school counselor, Chang Ming-hui (ÂºµÊòéÊöâ). She and Chang develop a romantic relationship, though she is unaware that Chang helps Miss Yin smuggle banned books for a secret book club where Wei and several other students are also members. After they finish counseling sessions, Chang ends their relationship, leaving Ray heartbroken. She overhears Chang and Miss Yin in the auditorium arguing how his relationship with Ray can endanger their book club, and she misinterprets this as Miss Yin being in a relationship with Chang as well. She passes out on the stage, leading to the events at the start of the game when Wei wakes her up. On the night of the typhoon, Ray gets Wei to tell her about the book club and how Miss Yin is involved. She later convinces Wei to give her a copy of the book list. Inspired by the way her mother got rid of her abusive and philandering father by framing and reporting him to the authorities, Ray gives the list to Instructor Bai, a military officer, hoping it would get Miss Yin fired. However, this led to the arrest of Wei and the other student members, while Miss Yin fled the country. Chang, on the other hand, was executed. Believing herself responsible for Chang, Wei, and the other students' deaths, coupled with the bullying she received, Ray jumped off a school building. The player is actually playing as Ray's soul going through a cycle of purgatory as her soul refuses to accept her guilt. Towards the end, Ray's shadow appears and asks her a series of questions. If Ray refuses to acknowledge her actions and guilt, the shadow states that she and Ray are not the same, and Ray walks down a path beside a river of blood, with Wei, Chang, and Miss Yin telling her the cycle will not end. She enters the auditorium where people applaud her as her shadow awards her with a noose. Ray hangs herself, and the auditorium fades into its abandoned state in the present, implying Ray's soul will repeat the cycle. If she accepts her guilt, the true ending is unlocked. Ray finds a paper airplane containing a message of love and farewell from Chang and heads to his office. She witnesses Chang's arrest, and he tells Ray that people should be born to live freely without fear of oppression. The game shifts to the present. Wei, now a middle-aged man, (revealed to be the unnamed man Ray would see wandering the school earlier in the game) is revealed to be alive and was sentenced to hard labor but was pardoned following the end of the White Terror. His journal reveals Miss Yin spent the rest of her life abroad as an activist but died of lung cancer before she could return home. Wei heads to his old classroom and sits at his desk as Ray's ghost sits across him.  Development  During the prototype stage, Detention was originally meant to be a horror game called Devilpolis (È≠îÈÉΩ) by Coffee Yao. Yao felt that the game did not have a core story, and so they scrapped the original idea and made their second prototype with a Taiwanese dystopia setting inspired by George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty- Four. Later, he decided rather than to make a fictional setting, he could make use of Taiwan's existing history and set the story during Taiwan's period of military rule. The school setting and the name of the game (ËøîÊ†°, \\"return to school\\" in Chinese) were meant to resonate with the general public as a shared human experience. As the project expanded in scale, Yao was joined by 5 others and together founded the studio Abyss Watcher (Áú∫ÊúõËÄÖÂ∑•‰ΩúÂÆ§), later renamed Red Candle Games. The game official started development in February 2015. Detention's background music was composed by Taiwanese composer Weifan Chang who made use of Taiwanese elements like the suona used in Taiwanese funerary music. In addition, the soundtrack includes songs by Teng Yu-hsien that was banned by the military government in the 1960s such as \\"BƒÅng Chhun-hong\\" and \\"The Torment of a Flower\\". The soundtrack was released with the game on Steam as a DLC.  Reception  The game was critically acclaimed, and has also been well-received by consumers. Rely on Horror gave the game a 9 out of 10, saying that \\"every facet of Detention moves in one harmonious lockstep towards an unavoidable tragedy, drowning out the world around you.\\" Upon the game's release in January 2017, the user review on Steam has been overwhelmingly positive. Detention topped the games ranking on Steam in Taiwan and reached 3rd in Steam ranking globally within 3 days of its release. Detention as well as Red Candle's next game Devotion will be preserved at the Harvard-Yenching Library, the largest collection of East Asian works maintained at an American university.  Adaptations  Red Candle sold production rights for a film to 1 Production Film Co. on 21 June 2017. The film stars Gingle Wang as Fang Ray Shin and it was released in Taiwan on 20 September 2019. A television series adaptation named Detention: The Series was announced for Netflix. Produced in collaboration with Taiwan Public Television Service (PTS), the Chinese- language original series will premiere worldwide on Netflix exclusively on 5 December 2020.

In 1783 a wooden structure, the Bremer Bake, was built. Due to the increasing shipping traffic to the Weser, initial consultations started in 1824 to explore the construction of a fixed offshore lighthouse. Work started in 1854 and was completed in 1856. The offshore location posed a challenge and work was only possible during low tide when the sandbank was exposed. In order to optimize the safety, the lighthouse saw further upgrades between 1960 and 1961 with the installation of a radar system, directional radio antennas and a new casing for the light. In 1973 operation was fully automated and the lighthouse keeper withdrawn.

Biography Born in Paris to Irish parents (his father was from County Cork, his mother a Ms. Curran from Portaferry, County Down), Flynn was schooled at Douai and taught maths in Paris. Both he and his older brother Henri were ordained in Paris. Serving in the French army during World War One, \\"he spent two years as a hospital attendant before volunteering as chaplain to the 33rd Infantry Division that was fighting at the front.

Materials  Soft- faced or deadblow mallets have faces made of materials such as plastics, including nylon, natural rubber or tightly wound rawhide, or soft metals such as copper, aluminium, brass or lead. The goal of the choice of material is to prevent damage to the struck surface. The heads or individual faces are sometimes replaceable, because they will deform, wear out, or break over time. The hammers are graded by the weight of the head and by hardness of the striking face. Heads cast in solid brass are used in applications where less vibration is needed.

He is best known for his colorful, pointillist paintings that draw on techniques and motifs of magical realism, as well as his book illustrations and children's books for which he has won a number of awards.  Early life and education  Quint Buchholz grew up in Stuttgart, where he attended high school. He then studied Art History at the Ludwig Maximilians University in Munich from 1976 to 1977. From 1981 to 1986 he studied painting and graphic arts at the Munich Academy of Fine Arts, under the direction of professor Gerd Winner.  Illustration  Quint Buchholz started working as an illustrator for the magazines P.M. in 1979 and TransAtlantik in 1985, as well as for the popular German newspaper Die Zeit, which published fifteen reprints of his pictures in a literary supplement in 1988 (Die Zeit Literatur No. 41, 7 October 1988). Among the first books with covers and book illustrations by Buchholz, which were published in 1986/87, was a German translation of Jonathan D. Spence's The Question of Hu. In the years that followed, he continued painting pictures which were used for German and international novels and children's books, among others by Katherine Scholes, Amos Oz, Jostein Gaarder, Lucy Hawking and Stephen Hawking, Takashi Hiraide and Luis Sep√∫lveda. In 1991, author Gudrun Mebs and Quint Buchholz won a Gold Plaque at the Bratislava Children's Book Illustration Biennial (BIB‚Äô91) for Sara Wants to Join the Circus (Die Sara, die zum Circus will). Buchholz's breakthrough came between 1995 and 1997, when he illustrated two international bestsellers: Jostein Gaarder's Sophie's World, which ranked number 1 on the German magazine Der Spiegel‚Äôs bestseller list in 1995; and Nero Corleone by Elke Heidenreich, a book that became a bestseller in Germany and ranked 6th on the Spiegel‚Äôs bestseller list of 1996. Nero Corleone was subsequently translated into 23 languages and received a number of awards, e.g. the Dutch children‚Äôs book award Vlag en wimpel in 1997 and a Mildred L. Batchelder Award (Honors) in 1998. Buchholz has illustrated over 40 works of German and world literature, and books with pictures by him are currently available in 25 languages. A newer example is ‚ÄûThe Alchemy of Snowness‚Äú, an autobiographically inspired book written by internationally known clown Slava Polunin and published in English in 2014, featuring 27 pictures by Buchholz. The artist has created hundreds of paintings used for book covers, audio books, posters and advertisements, postcards, games, calendars and planners produced by a number of German publishing houses (e.g. Munich-based Carl Hanser Verlag, Ravensburger, Suhrkamp, Heye), as well as international publishing houses (among others, Random House, Macmillan/Farrar, Straus & Giroux, Beisler Editore, √âditions Milan, N√≥rdica Libros, CIP in China, and Grimm Press in Taiwan).  Painting  Quint Buchholz works as a freelance painter in Munich, Germany. Most of his paintings are painted in vivid colors, and the artist shows a preference for shades of blue as he frequently treats water, sky and night themes. Other commonly featured elements are animals, especially birds, books, and boats. Most pictures are painted in acrylic or oil paint on paper or cardboard, over the course of weeks, during which the artist adds dot after dot with finer and finer brushes until an almost photographic quality is reached. In terms of technique, Buchholz's paintings cite the traditions of photorealism and pointillism, while his topics and themes are also inspired by magical realism. His art, in which he creates a distinctly dreamy atmosphere that has inspired imitations by other artists such as Jungho Lee (winner of the World Illustration Award of 2016), has been called distinctly postmodern. The depicted elements, which can be read as elaborate and subtle symbolism, often tell stories with surprising messages revealing themselves only upon close scrutiny. Nevertheless, a number of critics have mentioned the fact that the pictures remain open for a variety of individual interpretations. In many of his paintings, the artist addresses the complexity of human-animal relationships, but a frequent topic is also the range and ambivalence of human emotions, imagination and actions in a complex, often ironic world.  Exhibitions  The first major exhibition of Buchholz's work took place in 1989 at the Wilhelmspalais in Stuttgart. Since then, his works have been exhibited at a variety of locations, among them the Gasteig Cultural Center in Munich (1995), the Ludwigshafen City Museum (1997), the museum Haus L√∂wenberg Gengenbach (1997), the Wilhelm Busch Museum (2002), the Literaturhaus Hamburg (2003) and Literaturhaus Munich (1998 and 2008), the International Youths‚Äô Library at Blutenburg Castle in Munich (2007), Wackerbarth Castle near Dresden (2014), the Rosenheim City Museum (2016-2018) et al. Buchholz is officially represented by the Rothweiler Gallery in Karlsruhe, where his paintings are always on display. However, he also has cooperations with a number of smaller and bigger galleries, cultural institutions, and bookstores in and around Munich, where he often gives readings and performances. Since 1999 Buchholz has repeatedly been featured in exhibitions abroad, often organized by the Goethe Institute. For example, his works have been shown in Nancy and Strasbourg, France (1999), at the Taipei Fine Arts Museum in Taiwan (2000), the Goethe Institute in Thessaloniki, Greece (2007), as well as in Medell√≠n and Bogot√°, Colombia (2014), Klagenfurt, Austria (2014), and Pazin, Croatia (2017).  Writing and awards  Buchholz has published a number of books as both author and illustrator. One of his best-known works is the children's picture book Sleep Well, Little Bear (1993), which was translated into 10 languages and won a New York Times ‚ÄûOutstanding Book of the Year‚Äú award in 1994. His book The Collector of Moments (1997) was listed as \\"One of the ten Best Illustrated Books of the Year‚Äú in the New York Times Book Review of 1999, won a Mildred L. Batchelder Award for the Best Foreign Children's Book in 2000, as well as the Italian ‚ÄûBologna Ragazzi Award‚Äú (1998) and the French ‚ÄûPrix Enfantaisie‚Äú (1999). In 1997, a group of international authors (T.C. Boyle, Susan Sontag, John Berger, Milan Kundera, Per Olov Enquist, Rafik Schami, Orhan Pamuk, Antonio Tabucchi, among others) wrote stories about 46 of Buchholz's pictures, to be published in Buchholz's anthology BookPictureBook. The book received one of the ‚ÄûPremios a los libros mejor editados en 2016‚Äú, an award by the Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports. Other major works are Quint‚Äôs Life of Animals (Quints Tierleben, 2012), an anthology of international texts about animal-human relationships; a special edition of the Bible, The Bible in Images (Die Bibel in Bildern, 2010), which author Elke Heidenreich has written an extensive commentary about, and In the Land of Books (2013), a picture book about reading and books that received the Italian Premio Letteratura Ragazzi 36 award for the best-illustrated children's book in 2015. Two books with pictures by Quint Buchholz were on the Honor Roll of the Hans-Christian-Andersen Award (1992 and 1996), and five books were shortlisted for one of the most important German literary awards, the German Children's Literature Award (Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis) (1991, 1994 and 1995). Buchholz also received three awards from the German Foundation of Book Art (Stiftung Buchkunst) (1989, 1993 and 1995), and won five ‚ÄûDer Luchs‚Äú awards from Die Zeit/Radio Bremen between 1990 and 2004  Theater  Buchholz has worked as a stage designer in productions of ‚ÄúThe Golem‚Äú (2005) and ‚ÄúCaligula‚Äú (2007) at the Munich Metropole Theater (director: Jochen Schoelch). In 2008 a play version of Buchholz's book The Collector of Moments premiered at the Th√©√¢tre de Cornouaille in Quimper, France, under the direction of Jacques Nichet and starring Jacques Echantillon. Since 2011 the play has been a regular part of the program at the Munich Metropole Theatre and is usually performed from December through January  Teaching  Since 2008, Buchholz has been teaching painting and illustration at Irsee Monastery, as well as at the Academy of Fine Arts in Kolbermoor and the Bad Reichenhall Art Academy.

Reception Sajin Shrijith from The New Indian Express, who rated 3 in a scale of 5 found the film's narration interesting, yet few portions \\"needlessly stretched\\". \\"She [Dinaker] isn't interested in winning awards; she is only interested in providing you with two hours of guilty-free entertainment\\", he wrote. Ayyappan R. of Malayala Manorama wrote: \\"being a long-term love story it oscillates so much between time zones making you so giddy ... Yet, despite the zig-zagness of the form, the film moves at a smooth languid, almost dreamy, pace, befitting a mature love story\\". He praised the performances of Prithviraj and Parvathy, editing and colour grading. T. Nirmalkumar of Mathrubhumi rated 3 out of 5 and praised the lead performances, particularly Parvathy's, and said the film \\"demonstrates the craft which is not of a debutante. It is a love story portrayed on a colourful and unique canvas. But, the engaging first half storytelling is followed by a cliche flashback which made it an ordinary story\\". Priya Sreekumar of the Deccan Chronicle appreciated the performances of Prithviraj and Parvathy, cinematography, costumes, sound and music department, but was critical about the screenplay, and rated 2.5 out of 5 stars. Asha Prakash of The Times of India rated 2.5 out of 5 stars. She appreciated the performances of Prithviraj and Parvathy, visuals and music, but felt that the film had too much cinematic cliches.https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/malayalam/movie- reviews/my-story/movie-review/64881676.cms The Indian Express reviewer Manoj Kumar R. had the impression that Jay's characterization was unconvincing and his \\"repugnant personality\\" was \\"sugarcoated\\" by the filmmaker. He rated 2 out of 5 stars.https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/movie-review/my- story-movie-review-parvathy-prithviraj-5248968/ Sowmya Rajendran of The News Minute praised Prithviraj and Parvathy's performances, at the same time, said the characters suffer from unequal writing.https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/my-story-review-parvathy-and- prithviraj-shine-cliched-plot-let-down-84288 References External links Indian films 2018 films Malayalam-language films 2010s Malayalam-language films Films shot in Portugal Indian romance films 2018 romance films ","title":"My Story (film)"},{"id":"52858521","text":"Stefan Szeider is an Austrian computer scientist who works on the areas of algorithms, computational complexity, theoretical computer science, and more specifically on propositional satisfiability, constraint satisfaction problems, and parameterised complexity. He is a full professor at the Faculty of Informatics at the Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien), the head of the Algorithms and Complexity Group, and co-chair of the Vienna Center for Logic and Algorithms of TU Wien (VCLA).  Education  Szeider received his doctorate in Mathematics from the University of Vienna in 2001 under the supervision of Professors Herbert Fleischner and Georg Gottlob while working as a mathematician at the Austrian Academy of Sciences.  Career and research  Szeider is a full professor at the Faculty of Informatics at TU Wien. Previously he was first Lecturer and then Reader at the University of Durham, UK (2004-2009) and a postdoc with Professor Stephen Cook‚Äôs Group at the University of Toronto (2002-2004). He is a co-chair of the Vienna Center for Logic and Algorithms which he founded together with Helmut Veith in 2012. He serves on the editorial boards of the Journal of Computer and System Sciences, the Journal of Discrete Algorithms, the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research and Fundamenta Informaticae. Szeider published more than 140 refereed publications in the areas of theoretical computer science, algorithms, computational complexity, artificial intelligence, propositional satisfiability and constraint satisfaction. Szeider is best known for popularizing the notion of backdoor sets for SAT and other problems and the introduction of dependency schemes for quantified boolean formulas. Szeider also worked on width measures for graphs such as treewidth and clique-width. He showed with coauthors that it is NP-hard to determine whether the clique- width of a given graph is smaller than a given bound. He established complexity results for detecting minimally unsatisfiable formulas.
