The series was a spin-off of Sonic the Hedgehog and shared continuity with that title. The series continued the ongoing story of Knuckles' search for answers about his heritage and true nature, which had previously been featured in the Sonic the Hedgehog series as well as several specials and miniseries. After the series' cancellation in 2000, Knuckles's stories were continued as a regular feature in issues of Sonic the Hedgehog and sometimes even tied in with the Sonic story of an issue until 2003. After this, Knuckles and several of his supporting cast members became a semi-regular feature of Sonic's stories, ultimately crossing over both storylines in a usual manner. Archie Comics made a surprise announcement that they will re-release some of the series first issues in February 2009, along with the new side-series Sonic Universe.Archie Comics Launches New 'Sonic' Graphic Novel Series, Brigid Alverson, May 11, 2011 The first 21 issues and the entire miniseries were eventually reprinted in graphic novel form in Knuckles Archives with two more volumes planned for issues 22-32, but later cancelled after numerous delays. Overview The main focus of the comic is the title character, Knuckles the Echidna. His sacred duty is guarding the \\"Master Emerald\\", why he is destined to do this job is beyond even him. Knuckles' first three part miniseries \\"Sonic's Friendly Nemesis Knuckles\\" was released in 1996. His second miniseries was published in 1997, Knuckles: The Dark Legion and after three issues was continued into Knuckles the Echidna which began starting its numbering from issue 4. Archie has essentially 'retconned' \\"Sonic's Friendly Nemesis\\" as being Knuckles the Echidna 1 through 3. This was also done with the Sonic Vs Knuckles: Battle Royal one-shot which they 'retconned' into being Sonic Super Special #1. Knuckles Chaotix is a one shot that ties directly into the ongoing series. Knuckles the Echidna also used a cover gimmick where the three issues that made up one story had covers that when joined together made one big image three covers wide (known as a triptych). These covers were drawn by Patrick Spaziante until issue 25 when Manny Galan took over for the final issues, Gallan was the series‚Äô interior artist until issue 25 when the series changed format with issue 26 into a main story and a back-up story, Galan became the artist for the back-up stories (Featuring Mighty the Armadillo and Espio the Chameleon) and the main story was drawn by different artists, first Chris Allan (#26-28) then Sonic the Hedgehog regular Art Mawhinney (#29) then finally the writer Ken Penders for the rest of the series‚Äô duration. Setting Like the Sonic comic, Knuckles's comic is filled with background information about Knuckles's family history. Knuckles's family had split into two factions: the Brotherhood of Guardians and the Dark Legion. Knuckles is a member of the former, and Julie-Su used to be a member of the latter. Much of the conflict of the comic surrounds the relations between these two warring factions. Cast of characters With the exception of Knuckles and the Chaotix, and later Ray the Flying Squirrel, Knuckles the Echinda featured a totally original cast of characters created specifically for the book, some of whom have gone onto continue to play a large part in the regular Sonic the Hedgehog series and universe. After the crossover between Archie's Sonic the Hedgehog and Mega Man comics in 2013, most of these characters were severed from the Sonic canon, due in most part to Ken Penders' lawsuit against Archie Comics. Heroes :For more info, see Sonic the Hedgehog Comic Characters. * Knuckles the Echidna Sworn guardian of the Floating Island who was trained by his father Locke, and later by a mentor named Archimedes. * Julie-Su A former soldier of the villainous Dark Legion, and half-sister of their leader Kragok and his twin sister the Kommisar Lien-Da. Julie-Su has since defected, and became Knuckles' girlfriend (though a sixth sense in echidna biology known as the soultouch) after fighting alongside him for a long period. This character setting had never remained however, and Knuckles' after appearances became of a 16-year-old single determined to protect the Master Emerald stationed on Angel Island. She is distantly related to Knuckles and the Brotherhood of Guardians, at least 12 generations removed via Dimitri. * Chaotix When the series began the team consisted of Vector the Crocodile, Espio the Chameleon, Mighty The Armadillo and Charmy Bee. Charmy briefly left the group to return home, but rejoined after the series' cancellation along with his fianc√©, Saffron. Though Ray the Flying Squirrel was rescued during the series, he did not join the group until after the series cancellation. Later additions included Saffron and Julie-Su. *Locke the Echidna Knuckles's Father and predecessor as Guardian of the Floating Island. Locke foresaw a disaster, and exposed his son to the Chaos Emeralds while he was still an egg, giving him abilities beyond those of any other guardian. After training Knuckles rigorously, he passed the position of guardian on to Knuckles and joined his forefathers in the Brotherhood of Guardians. He reappears sporadically throughout the series to help Knuckles with his problems. Currently deceased. * Lara-Le Knuckles mother, a woman of Echidna high society, who lives in Echinopolis during the series' run. Her tumultuous marriage with Locke ended badly, and although he has tried to woo her back occasionally, Lara-Le has had enough of Locke placing his work above his wife and son. She currently lives with her new husband Wynmacher, with whom she eventually has a child with named Kneecapeon Mace. She dotes on her son and is very motherly towards him. *Constable Remington A dedicated leader in the Echidnapolis Security Team and trusted ally of Knuckles. Although he is not corrupt, he is the son of former Dark Legion grandmaster, and has many underworld connections. Remington was briefly missing in action after being captured by Dr. Eggman, but he would later resurface, having seemingly learned of his Legionnaire heritage and taking command of the Frost Legion splinter group. *The Brotherhood of Guardians (Also known as the Brotherhood of Haven) A group of former Guardians who operate out of Haven, a technologically advanced base in the Forbidden Zone, from which they also monitor the planet below. With the exception of Tobor (who is revealed to be a former Dark Legion grandmaster named Moritori Rex), they are all ancestors of Knuckles. They are currently missing following the one-year leap forward in the Sonic the Hedgehog series. *Archimedes A fire Ant who trained Knuckles, as Fire Ants have trained all Guardians since they began. Archimedes or 'Archy' (pronounced 'Ar-kee') is kind and good natured, but his duty caused him to keep many secrets from Knuckles which led his pupil to mistrust him. Recent issues of Sonic the Hedgehog have shown him to be hiding on Angel Island, but he has received little exposure since his brief reappearance. Villains * The Dark Legion The antithesis to the Brotherhood of Guardians, the Legion is an army of cyborg Echidnas who worship Enerjak and technology. Its leaders (known as Grandmasters) are all descendants of Enerjak's original alter-ego, Dimitri the Echidna, just as the Guardians were descended from Dimitri's brother, Edmund. *Enerjak/Dimitri Knuckles' uncle and supreme leader of the Dark Legion, he is the ancient forefather of every Legion grandmaster. He was powered by eleven chaos Emeralds and turned into a godlike being before he was defeated and depowered by Mammoth Mogul. After losing his power and enhanced longevity, he was rebuilt as a cyborg. He is currently reduced to a floating head inside a clear protective sphere. *Renfield T. Rodent A shady businessman who ran the Happyland theme parks on the Floating Island while involving himself in underworld dealings as well. He was later contracted by Dr. Eggman to secretly build robotic armies, but this operation was shut down by the Chaotix Crew. Renfield was named after the character R.M. Renfield from Bram Stoker's novel Dracula (1897). *Downtown Ebony Hare A powerful gangster in Echidnapolis, he tried to muscle in on his subordinate Renfield's Happyland caper, attempting to kill Chaotix member Julie-Su in the process. He was later taken into custody by Constable Remington, and has not been seen since Eggman's take-over of Angel Island. *Hunter An Overlander (human) who hunts Mobians for sport. Sophisticated and intelligent, he was also quite insane, and shot dead Knuckles' childhood rival Monk as part of a hunt across Angel Island. He was given increased powers by Dr. Eggman, but was still unable to defeat Knuckles, who threw him into the sea. *General Helmut von Stryker The leader of the Dingos during the series' run, a huge, muscled soldier with a militaristic and aggressive nature who worked both against and alongside Knuckles. His current fate is unknown following the one-year jump, and he appears to have been supplanted by his son, a cyborg commander affiliated with Eggman named General Kage. Storyline With the exception of issues 25 and 29 (which were both single issues) the series was broken down into three part story-arcs: The Dark Legion (Issues 1-3) Led by Kragok, the Dark Legion, a cult of technology-worshiping echidnas formed by the disgruntled son of Enerjak, return from the twilight Zone that Steppenwolf, the second Guardian, sent them too so as to reclaim the Floating Island. Knuckles and the Chaotix defeat them as their plan is about to succeed destroying their base. From this story to present the Dark Legion have been hiding/living on the Floating Island. The story also re-accounted the history of the Dark Legion and the history of Steppenwolf, the first fully trained Guardian. Lost Paradise (Issues 4-6) The damage caused to the Zones (alternate realities) in the Endgame story-arc in the regular Sonic the Hedgehog series causes Echinopolis (the capital of the Floating Island) and Echidna's ancient enemies the Dingos to both return to the Floating Island after they were evacuated to The Hyper Zone by Guardian Hawking some 200 years earlier to escape the radioactive fallout of a Dingo missile strike. But both cities are attempting to return to the same location which could cause them both to be destroyed. Knuckles meets his mother and Julie-Su, and deals with the warring General Stryker. Echidnapolis is the city that survives, leaving the Dingos stranded there and causing a housing problem. The story also told the history of the disappearance of the Echidnas and introduced Constable Remmington and Grandfather Hawking. Dark Vengeance (Issues 7-9) Mammoth Mogul revives Enerjak from his space prison and returns him to the Dark Legion where he captures Knuckles (after quickly defeating the fire ants) and the Chaotix. Enerjak tortures Knuckles for an entire issue before splitting him up into individual molecules and leading his Dark Legion to Echinopolis where he clashes with the Dingo and Echidna armed forces, a fight which lasts until Mammoth Mogul appears and drains Enerjak of the energies he absorbed from the Chaos Emeralds, leaving him an ancient, decrepit man. The story continued onto Sonic the Hedgehog issue 56 where Super Sonic, Hyper Knuckles and Turbo Tails fought Mammoth Mogul. Julie-Su also went undercover into the Dark Legion in this story causing readers and characters to question where her loyalties lie (either her old cult or Knuckles and the Chaotix). The Lost Tribe (Issues 10-12) Introducing yet more Echidnas, The Lost Tribe are the descendants of the Echidnas who chose to stay on Mobius when the Floating Island was raised they are currently under the leadership of Athair, Knuckles' ancestor who abandoned his role as Guardian to lead them. Knuckles is left in charge of the band after Athair vanishes and safely takes them to Albion via Mercia which is under the rule of Antoine D'Coolette's roboticized father. The story ties into Sonic the Hedgehog #59 and introduces Rob O' The Hedge and also tells the origin of Athair. The Chaotix Caper (Issues 13-15) A story focusing on The Chaotix, which now include Julie-Su. The team are caught up between two warring gangsters‚ÄîRenfield The Rat and Downtown Ebony Hare. Hare was worried about Renfield's new Happyland amusement park because of its 'Special Sauce' -- an addictive drug the rat put in the food. The 'Special Sauce' seems to be especially poisonous to bees and kills Charmy's childhood friend Mello and nearly kills Charmy, who has to be operated on. Julie Su also nearly perishes when she discovers what is going on and is thrown from a roof by Hare while the Chaotix are recovering in hospital from the Special Sauce. After recovering and stopping Hare the Chaotix bury Mello and Charmy reclaims his birthright as prince of the Bees. The story tells Charmy's origin and also reveals that he can grow to 'normal size' as well as the small size he was shown as being previously. It also introduced Harry the Cabbie. Reunion/Deep Cover (Issues 16-18) Fully introducing and focusing on the Brotherhood of Guardians. One of their number Tobor was replaced by Moritori Rex the father of current Dark Legion leader Krygok after a battle between them left them both blind and buried in rubble. The real Tobor returned to the Floating Island and his revelations lead to a battle between Knuckles and Krygok, and then Tobor and Krygok leading to the latter two being trapped in the Zone. Their fates have never been addressed. The story introduced a strange reaction caused by the meetings of the Descendants of Dimitri (The Legion leaders) and the Descendants of Edmund (The Guardians) that opens portals to other Zones. The Forbidden Zone (Issues 19-21) A crossover with the Sonic the Hedgehog series, the story follows Knuckles and King Acorn's Secret Service#Members#Geoffrey St. JohnGeoffrey St. John's King Acorn's Secret ServiceSecret Service as they journey into the Forbidden Zone (the location of Haven, the base of operations for the Brotherhood of Guardians). The Secret Service are looking for Queen Alicia and Knuckles is searching for answers about his past, and they are both shocked to find Elias Acorn, an heir to the Acorn throne nobody had previously known about. This story, though lacking much in the way of action or adventure would have huge ramifications in the Sonic the Hedgehog series. Dark Alliance (Issues 22-24) The Dark Legion tries to gain control of the Floating Island via an upcoming election in Echidnopolois, taking control of a prominent senator to support their Hitler- like candidate Benedict who soon gains the public's favor. Enerjak, now powerless and a cyborg, takes control of Haven and kidnaps Knuckles, Julie-Su, General Stryker, and the Brotherhood of Guardians. They are freed by Locke and Spectre, Benedict is revealed as a robot and the Legion escapes once more. This story also introduced Lien-Da, who went gone on to become a major antagonist in Sonic the Hedgehog. Also notable in this story was Benedict's mention of a secret held by Constable Remington, an issue not seemingly resolved until much later in the main Sonic the Hedgehog title. Childhood‚Äôs End (Issue 25) A story detailing Knuckles' origin (which includes the full history of the Brotherhood and his upbringing) and his meeting with his father for the first time since he abandoned him as a child. This also marks the series‚Äô only milestone issue. The First Date (Issues 26-28) A story focusing on Knuckles and Julie-Su's friendship. When Julie-Su goes out on a date with another Echidna, Knuckles finds out the date clashes with a surprise party for his birthday. A Friend in Need (Issues 26-28) A back-up story featuring Mighty the Armadillo, adapting the arcade game SegaSonic the Hedgehog. Mighty and Nic the Weasel rescue Ray the Flying Squirrel who has been trapped holding onto a gem since Sonic and Mighty escaped from a prison camp years earlier. The arc also introduced a flesh-and-blood version of Fiona Fox, whose robotic clone had previously been introduced in Sonic the Hedgehog. My Special Friend (Issue 29) A story of when Princess Sally Acorn used to vacation on the Floating Island and play with Knuckles during her childhood. During a visit, Sally tries to convince the Brotherhood to join the war against Dr. Robotnik, but they deny her request which leads to complications of her & Knuckles‚Äô friendship. King of the Hill (Issues 30-32) Monk, a purple gorilla who bullied Knuckles as a child, returns to the Floating Island after being literally thrown off the island by the Brotherhood of Guardians. Their fight is interrupted by the Overlander Hunter, who hunts Mobians for sport. Fitted with restraining collars the two are forced to work together to evade Hunter using Knuckles' knowledge of the Island and Monk's brute strength. Knuckles releases the full force of his Chaos Emerald-born powers to stop Hunter, who is, as a result, imprisoned by The Brotherhood. Though the series was cancelled with issue 32, Penders resolved many dangling plot threads in Sonic Super Special #14. He also continued to write back-up stories in the regular Sonic the Hedgehog series that followed the ongoing series in which Knuckles developed fully the Chaos Emerald-based powers he first displayed in the King of the Hill story-line. Knuckles eventually died to save Enerjak's life. The Afterlife story that followed was part of the lead up to Sonic the Hedgehog #125 and following the 1-year jump in issue 130, Knuckles and The Chaotix were living in Knothole City working as Freedom Fighters. Most of the characters from the ongoing series were dealt with in the Return to Angel Island story- line (issues 138-141) where the Dingos had taken over the Island, the Dark Legion were acting as a resistance group, and the Brotherhood of Guardians were missing. Hunter, Constable Remington and the Fire Ants were among the casualties of the story-line, though the story also raised some questions as to the whereabouts of some of the Knuckles the Echidna characters, most notably General Stryker.

The Inaugural Festival of 1974 was conceived as a celebration of both the \\"natural beauty of the state and the genius of the Festival's namesake\\", composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The Festival's mission quickly grew, and since its third season it featured performances of a much broader range of classical and other repertoire. In 2010 the original Vermont Mozart Festival disbanded and dissolved. In 2015 violinist Michael Dabroski announced a new Vermont Mozart Festival, Inc. and programs with its Title Sponsor NBT Bank, the City of South Burlington, and partnerships with community supporters including Burlington Country Club, South Burlington Rotary Club and others. The not-for-profit Vermont Mozart Festival aims to attract local, national and international attention for its quality artistic programs, community relevance, accessibility and unique business model. Beginning in 2016, Vermont Mozart Festival will produce many all-Mozart concert events year round, including a summer series of outdoor concerts and a three-week summer Fellowship Program between July 18-August 7, 2016 for thirty (30) awardees, who will perform the concert series while studying Mozart, writing business plans and staying at Champlain College. History The Festival was founded in 1974 by Melvin Kaplan, oboist and teacher at Juilliard, in collaboration with conductor William Metcalfe and the University of Vermont. The first season featured all-Mozart performances at the UVM Show Barn, Shelburne Farms, Royall Tyler Theatre, Robert Hull Fleming Museum, St. Paul's Cathedral, and aboard the S.S. Champlain. Notably, the Shelburne Farms concert marked the first time that the site was opened for a public event. In all, ten concerts were held over two weeks; every concert sold out. The following season, the Festival's format was expanded to include 15 concerts and three workshops. This format remained mostly unchanged for rest of the Festivals 37 years, though in 2006 the Festival presented 19 concerts. The Festival performed more than 3,000 pieces in over 50 locations, including at least 278 of Mozart's 626 works‚Äîpossibly more than any other festival or concert series in the United States. The Festival was incorporated as a non-profit organization in late 1976; the first full board of directors was assembled in early 1977. Following a successful fundraising campaign, the Festival achieved national recognition when CBS Sunday Morning filmed a week of concerts on location. A series of winter concerts began in 1978, and by 1979 the Festival was firmly established, drawing praise from the New York Times, Boston Globe, Los Angeles Times, and Montreal Star. In 1983, the complete Winter Series was recorded by National Public Radio and aired on Performance Today. In 1984, the Festival presented its first concert on the meadow of the Trapp Family Lodge in Stowe, Vermont, which quickly became, along with Shelburne Farms, one of the Festival's two largest and most popular concert sites. In the 2000s, all concerts on the Trapp meadow were followed by fireworks displays. Traditions * The Grand Opening Concert of the Summer Festival was preceded by a classical dressage exhibition. * The Summer Festival concluded with Mozart's Ave verum Corpus. Financial sustainability In early 2005, the new Executive Director announced that the Festival was about $140,000 in debt‚Äîenough to put the Festival's continued existence in jeopardy. Supporters responded; and in two seasons, 65% of that debt was eliminated. The same Executive Director then resigned citing differences with the Festival's board of directors. Over the following four seasons, the deficit climbed to almost a third of the million dollar annual budget. After 36 years, the Festival closed its doors following the December 2010 winter concert. Notable performers Over the years, the Festival featured various performers including both established musicians and up-and-coming talent.

The Get Together is well-known within the magician industry as an annual event to gather and share information with their peers.

In 1934 Abbott reopened the business as the \\"Abbott Magic Company\\" with a new partner, Recil Bordner, and in an attempt to boost poor sales, they decided to hold an open house.

History The second article in Vermont's constitution, originally written in 1777, abolished slavery, making it the first state to do so. Although its climate was not conducive to the slave trade, Vermonters were early participants in the abolitionist movement. In the 1860 presidential election, Vermont gave Republican Abraham Lincoln a lopsided victory, 33,808 votes compared to 8,649 for Stephen Douglas, 1,866 for John Bell, and 217 for John C. Breckinridge. One historian opined that the heavy rain on election day \\"reduced the Republican majority by at least 7,000\\" votes.Walter Hill Crockett, Vermont The Green Mountain State, (The Century History Company, Inc., New York, 1921), iii:491. In the closing days of 1860, in response to a pro-Southern resolution by Representative Albert Rust of Arkansas, Vermont Representative Justin S. Morrill offered an amendment, \\"Resolved, That in the opinion of this committee, the existing discontent among the Southern people and the growing hostility to the Federal Government, are greatly to be regretted, and that any reasonable, proper and constitutional remedy necessary to preserve the peace of the country, and the perpetuity of the Union, should be promptly and cheerfully grant.\\" His amendment was rejected by a large majority, and Congress and the Union continued its downward spiral toward disunion.Walter Hill Crockett, Vermont The Green Mountain State, (The Century History Company, Inc., New York, 1921), iii:496 Lawyer Lucius E. Chittenden served on the ill-fated Peace conference of 1861 and later as Registrar of the Treasury in the Lincoln administration. Vermont politicians in Congress included Senators Solomon Foot and Jacob Collamer and Representatives Justin S. Morrill, Homer Elihu Royce and Portus Baxter. During the war, three men served as Governor of Vermont; Erastus Fairbanks, Frederick Holbrook and J. Gregory Smith. Fairbanks reportedly responded to the Federal Government's response for troops with \\"Vermont will do its Full Duty.\\" Under his administration, Vermont fielded six infantry and one cavalry regiments. Governor Holbrook's administration saw the recruitment of 10 infantry regiments, 2 light artillery batteries, and 3 sharpshooter companies. Under his administration, as well, Vermont built three military hospitals in the state which were \\"soon credited by the United States medical inspector with perfecting a larger percentage of cures than any United States military hospital record elsewhere could show.\\"Nancy E. Boone and Michael Sherman, \\"Designed to Cure: Civil War Hospitals in Vermont,\\" Vermont History, Winter 2001, 69:174 Governor Smith oversaw the recruitment of Vermont's last infantry regiment, a third light artillery battery, and, as a result of a Confederate raid on his hometown, St. Albans, two companies of frontier cavalry. Military enrollment The state sent more than 34,000 to serve, out of a total population of about 350,000 citizens. More than 28,100 Vermonters served in Vermont volunteer units. Vermont fielded 17 infantry regiments, 1 cavalry regiment, 3 light artillery batteries, 1 heavy artillery company, 3 companies of sharpshooters, and 2 companies of frontier cavalry. Instead of replacing units as they were depleted, Vermont regularly provided recruits to bring the units in the field back up to normal strength. Nearly 5,000 others served in other states' units, in the United States Army or the United States Navy. The 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry included 66 Vermont blacks; a total of 166 black Vermonters served out of a population of 709 in the state. Vermonters suffered a total of 1,832 men killed or mortally wounded in battle; another 3,362 died of disease, in prison or from other causes, for a total loss of 5,194. More than 2,200 Vermonters were taken prisoner during the war, and 615 of them died in or as a result of their imprisonment. Historian Howard Coffin claimed that the state's most important contribution to the war was at the Battle of the Wilderness where the Vermont Brigade held the crucial intersection of two roads, the loss of which would have split the Union forces in half. 1,200 Vermonters died. They also played a crucial role at the Battle of Gettysburg, where, under General George J. Stannard, the 2nd Vermont Brigade broke Pickett's charge by stepping out of a protected area and firing at the flank of the attackers. General Winfield Scott, learning that a regiment of Green Mountain Boys (the 1st Vermont Infantry) was awaiting orders, said \\"I want your Vermont regiments, all of them. I have not forgotten the Vermont men on the Niagara frontier... I remember the Vermont men in the War of 1812.\\"Benedict, G. G., Vermont in the Civil War. A History of the part taken by the Vermont Soldiers And Sailors in the War For The Union, 1861-5, Burlington, VT.: The Free Press Association, 1888, i:33-34 A significant number of generals hailed from Vermont. Several led Vermont units, including Lewis A. Grant, John W. Phelps, William Farrar Smith, George J. Stannard, Edwin H. Stoughton, Stephen Thomas, James M. Warner, and William Wells. Others served in other states' units or in the Regular Army, including Benjamin Alvord, John C. Caldwell, Sylvester Churchill, Joel Dewey, Charles Doolittle, William B. Hazen, Ethan Allen Hitchcock, Charles Edward Hovey, Joseph A. Mower, Thomas E. G. Ransom, Israel B. Richardson, Benjamin S. Roberts, Truman Seymour, George Crockett Strong, Stewart Van Vliet, and George Wright. Six Vermonters became brevet brigadier general, including Asa P. Blunt, George P. Foster, William W. Henry, John R. Lewis, Edward H. Ripley and Charles B. Stoughton. One native Vermonter, Chester A. Arthur, who later became President of the United States, served as Adjutant General of the State of New York during the war. Vermonters played a significant role in the maritime aspects of the war as well, but they frequently get overlooked. Some of the more prominent sailors include George Dewey, Charles Edgar Clark, George F. Emmons, George Colvocoresses, Theodore P. Greene, Edward D. Robie, and Edwin T. Woodward. Service The first military action seen by Vermonters was at the Battle of Big Bethel on June 10, 1861, where a battalion of the 1st Vermont Infantry was engaged. The 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and later the 11th Vermont Infantry regiments served in the 1st Vermont Brigade, which saw action in nearly every major engagement in the Eastern Theater from the First Battle of Bull Run to Appomattox Court House. The 7th Vermont Infantry, 8th Vermont Infantry, and two Vermont Light Artillery Batteries served in the Department of the Gulf under Benjamin F. Butler. The 8th Vermont later saw service in the Shenandoah Valley Campaigns of 1864. The 9th Vermont Infantry suffered capture at the Battle of Harpers Ferry during the 1862 Maryland Campaign, but later fought well with the VII, XVIII and XXIV Corps in eastern Virginia and North Carolina, and was one of the first units to enter Richmond, Virginia, in April 1865. The 10th Vermont Infantry gained its niche in history at the Battle of Monocacy, an important but often overlooked battle that delayed a Confederate drive on Washington D.C. At Gettysburg on the first day of battle, July 1, 1863, General John Sedgwick is quoted as saying, \\"Put the Vermonters ahead and keep the column well closed up.\\" The 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th and 16th Vermont Infantry regiments were banded together as the 2nd Vermont Brigade, which gained lasting credit for its actions in helping stop Pickett's Charge on July 3, 1863, during the Battle of Gettysburg. At the Battle of the Wilderness, Vermont experienced its worst day of the war; 1,000 men were killed or wounded from the 1st Vermont Brigade alone. One in eight of the casualties resulting in the battle was by this brigade, which was one of 32 brigades on the Union side. Vermont fielded three companies of sharpshooters, which served with Hiram Berdan in the two U.S. Sharpshooter regiments. The 1st Vermont Cavalry regiment participated in more than 70 engagements. After the St. Albans raid on October 19, 1864, Vermont fielded two companies of Frontier Cavalry, who spent six months on the Canada‚ÄìUS border to prevent further incursions from Confederate raiders. Sixty-four Vermonters received the Medal of Honor, including Willie Johnston, the youngest person ever to receive the award.

On October 19, 1864, Confederate raiders, under the command of Lieutenant Bennett H. Young, robbed three banks, escaped to Canada, were captured, and put on trial. The Canadian courts decided they were acting under military orders and they could not be extradited back to the United States without Canada violating her neutrality. Most Vermont towns have a monument in memory of the soldiers who participated in the Civil War. Decades after the war, the upland hillsides of the state were littered with the cellar holes of long-gone farmhouses from farms that had been abandoned because all the family's sons had been killed in the Civil War. There are several facilities in the state that have significant collections of manuscripts and archives of the war, including the Vermont State House, the Vermont Historical Society, University of Vermont Howe Library, the Bennington Museum, the Sheldon Museum in Middlebury, the Vermont Veterans Militia Museum and Library, Norwich University Sullivan Museum and special collections, and the State of Vermont Public Records Division.

The couple settled in Graz, Austria, and had two children, Assen Ludwig Alexander (1890‚Äì1965) and Marie Therese Vera Zvetana (1893‚Äì1935). After her husband's early death, she moved to Vienna, where she was an active patron of musical organisations. Among other posts, she was president of the Vienna Symphony. Loisinger died on 20 July 1951 in Vienna. She was buried in St. Leonhard Cemetery in Graz where her daughter Zvetana was previously buried.

Unlike many jockeys, Don did not grow up around the race track. After his father, a veterinarian, purchased a horse trailer from a trainer in Juarez, Mexico, Don was given the opportunity to work as an exercise rider as a summer job. He continued as an exercise rider until he signed a contract with the trainer and began his horse racing career when he was 16 years old. He was the leading rider at Ruidoso Downs, New Mexico as a senior in high school. Career Don has raced throughout the United States and spent significant time at Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs, Arkansas where in 1991 he rode five winners on a single racecard.History - 1991 He also competed at Louisiana Downs (Shreveport, Louisiana) as well as in Chicago, New York and Kentucky. Howard was the leading rider at Louisiana Downs for several consecutive years in the late 1980s. As is the case with most jockeys, Don Howard experienced several serious injuries. In 1993, he suffered a nearly fatal accident while racing at Louisiana Downs. In the final stretch riding Police Cat, the horse broke its leg resulting in the horse falling into a somersault. Don was able to untangle himself from his horse only to be trampled by an apprentice's horse that was several lengths behind. Don was unconscious for nearly an hour and initially was not expected to survive. He suffered his fourth severe concussion in six months and had a compound fracture of his right humerus, the same arm that was nearly amputed when he was 14 due to a hay equipment accident. In 1994, Don Howard attempted to return to horse racing, only to discover that the fractured humerus had not healed. The non-union fracture required several additional surgeries. In 1997, Howard returned to horse racing in New Mexico and then back to Oaklawn Park. His circuit eventually included Prairie Meadows Racetrack in Altoona, Iowa. Don Howard was very successful at Prairie Meadows and was consistently in the top 3 jockeys in the number of wins as well as earnings. He never officially retired, but has not raced since 2002.

History The village is located at the northern entrance of the Malian Gulf, some 2 km south of the acropolis of the ancient city of Larissa Kremaste. The ancient city is still mentioned until the early Byzantine period, but was abandoned after the Slavic invasions of the 7th century and reappears only in the 11th century under the new, Slavic, name of Gardiki, which the settlement bore until 1927, when it was renamed to Pelasgia. In the 11th century, Gardiki‚Äîreferred to in Byzantine sources also as hetera Gardikia (·ºëœÑŒ≠œÅŒ± ŒìŒ±œÅŒ¥ŒπŒ∫ŒØŒ±), \\"the other Gardiki\\", to distinguish it from the town of the same name near Trikala‚Äîwas an episcopal see (a suffragan see of the Metropolis of Larissa). The Jewish traveller Benjamin of Tudela, who visited it in 1165, found it almost deserted, with only a few Greek and Jewish families resident. Nevertheless, under Emperor Isaac II Angelos in 1189 it is listed as among the metropolitan sees, albeit without any suffragans. A manuscript list indicates that there was a Greek bishop named John in 1191‚Äì92.Sophrone P√©trid√®s, \\"Cardica\\" in Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1908) In the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade, the town came under Frankish rule, and was known as Gardichy, Cardiche, Lacardica, and Gaudica. The local see accordingly came under the Latin Church. GamsPius Bonifacius Gams, Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae, Leipzig 1931, p. 432 mentions five Latin bishops from 1208 to 1389, the first being Bartholomew, to whom many letters of Pope Innocent III are addressed; Bartholomew was also bishop of Velestino and Demetrias, and seems to have been the only residential Latin bishop.Konrad Eubel, Hierarchia Catholica Medii Aevi, vol. 1, pp. 166‚Äì167; vol. 3, p. 153; vol. 4, p. 135; vol. 5, p. 143 In 1222 it was recovered by the Epirote Greeks and the see was restored to its Greek Orthodox clergy, becoming an archbishopric and eventually again a metropolis. In 1275 it was ceded by the ruler of Thessaly, John I Doukas, along with Zetounion, Gravia, and Siderokastron, to the Duchy of Athens as part of the dowry of his daughter Helena Angelina Komnene. In ca. 1294 the town was granted by the Duke of Athens Guy II de la Roche to Boniface of Verona, who held its lordship at least until the Battle of Halmyros in 1311. Along with other towns in southern Thessaly such as Domokos and Pharsalus, in the mid-1320s Gardiki came briefly under the rule of the Catalan Company, which had taken over the Duchy of Athens in the aftermath of Halmyros. Latin bishops of the Dioecesis Cardicensis are still mentioned in 1363 and ca. 1396. The town surrendered to the Ottoman Turks after the fall of Euboea in 1470, and its inhabitants were deported to Constantinople.

History=19th century In 1873, competition between the cities of Houston and Galveston was strong, and the Galveston, Houston & Henderson Railroad (GH&H;) was the only rail link between the two cities. The competition between Houston and Galveston was fed by the quarantines, which were often imposed on Galveston traffic by Houston. These quarantines occurred almost annually and were based on yellow fever outbreaks and epidemics. So, the citizens of Galveston decided to build their own railroad line that would reach across Texas, into the Panhandle, and across the state line to Santa Fe, New Mexico. The idea was to bypass Houston. The Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railroad (GC&SF;) was chartered, and the state agreed to grant 16 sections of land per mile of track laid. While the charter passed in 1873, the actual construction of the line did not begin until two years later. The plans to initiate construction were formulated by the railroad's first engineer, General Braxton Bragg, former commander of the Confederate Army of Tennessee. At a meeting of the board of directors on February 8, 1875, the board resolved to negotiate for land for both a depot and the location of the line from Galveston to an intersection of the Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio line. At other meetings in 1875, the board of directors asked for proposals for contracting the building of the bridge across Galveston Bay and for the laying of track to Arcola, Texas. On April 30, 1875, Henry Rosenberg, president of the GC&SF;, signed a contract with Burnett and Kilpatrick that included the construction of a bridge across the bay, complete with a lifting draw, for $69,000. The depot grounds were located between 37th and 38th Streets and Mechanic and Strand. The railroad line was to follow Mechanic Street to 60th, where it would be routed to the bridge. Construction began on May 1, 1875. By May 28, the line reached Arcola, with surveys made as far as the Brazos River. In September 1876, the Galveston, Houston, & Henderson Railroad completed a new passenger depot, located on the corner of Avenue A and Tremont Street. The GC&SF; would share this depot for their passenger line once the trains began running continuously. By March 1877, track from Galveston to Arcola was complete and arrangements were being made to put regular trains on the line. The company planned to cross the Brazos River and proceed to Richmond, where it would connect with the San Antonio line. This would make one continuous route to Galveston 11 miles shorter than any other road. By the next year, the company also completed an iron bridge 480 feet long over the Brazos River, and by October, a regular train was being run over the road. In December 1878, the company began to experience financial difficulties. Directors voted to advertise for a loan of $250,000 for 90 days, which would enable them to pay off the debts and finish the road to Richmond. The only offer for the loan was made by a group of Galveston citizens headed by Galveston businessman George Sealy. The loan was secured by a deed of trust on the entire properties of the railway company. When the 90-day note matured, the company did not have the funds to pay for it. Therefore, on April 15, 1879, the entire properties of the line were sold at a public sale in front of the courthouse. The highest bid was for $200,000 made by George Sealy. The new company was organized, and directors were elected. By May, the new directors had organized a corps of engineers to locate the line to Brenham. Chief engineer, Bernard Moore Temple, sent surveyors into the interior of Texas, and as the line was located, Temple followed with construction crews. The new directors also obtained rights to build a spur into Houston. By this time, the real importance of a line into Houston had been realized, and the success of the road depended on it. In 1880, the GC&SF; won fame by establishing the first daily newspaper train in the U.S. Because of another quarantine placed on Galveston by Houston, the Galveston News arranged for a special train to carry the newspaper from Galveston to Rosenberg. There, the newspaper was transferred to the Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Railroad, which distributed the news across Texas. The road reached a distance of 226 miles upon reaching Belton in March 1881. The company had also constructed a telegraph line along the line of the railroad, and they began seeing a return on that investment that year, as well. In 1882, the main line reached Lampasas, and another branch opened from Alvin to Houston. The company received support from many counties and communities along the line. Donations ranged in size from $70 given by Nickleville to $85,000 contributed by Fort Worth. Other small towns, such as Weatherford, Paris, Ladonia, Honey Grove, and Farmersville, also provided funds. Along the way, the railroad developed towns such as Rosenberg, Sealy, and Temple, which became a division point. In the mid-1880s, chief engineer Temple was succeeded by engineer Walter Justin Sherman. Sherman encountered quite a few labor problems along the line. Especially in the hot summers, members of the construction crews would desert, and replacements were hard to find. GC&SF; authorized a daily whiskey ration, and Sherman dispensed a dipper of liquor at the end of the day to each member of the crew in an effort to keep morale high. As early as 1881, GC&SF; attracted the attention of several large railroad magnates. Jay Gould, who held a monopoly in North Texas, presented a threat to the other Texas lines, including the GC&SF.; William Barstow Strong, president of AT&SF;, actively pursued a way to break Gould's stronghold on Texas railroad commerce. Plagued by additional financial problems, Sealy and the other leaders of GC&SF; realized the railway would need a connection north out of Texas if it were to survive. William Strong offered a connection between the two lines. On March 25, 1886, the stockholders authorized George Sealy to work toward an exchange of stock between the two companies. The agreement stated that the GC&SF; line would be built from Fort Worth to Purcell, in Indian Territory, and would connect there with the southbound AT&SF; line. Then GC&SF; was to build to Paris and connect with the St. Louis‚ÄìSan Francisco Railway, as well as build a branch from Cleburne to Weatherford. On April 26, 1887, Sherman reached Purcell, four hours ahead of schedule and before AT&SF; crews. By June, trains began to run from Kansas City to Galveston. With the completion of the line to Purcell, AT&SF; assumed control of GC&SF.; The contract, signed on March 3, 1886, by Sealy and Strong, provided for the transfer of the entire capital stock of GC&SF; to AT&SF; in exchange for $8 million in AT&SF; stock. On March 23, representatives of the AT&SF; were elected to the board of GC&SF; and the merger was completed. While GC&SF; had officially become part of AT&SF;, it was still an important section of the rail line. The fact that it connected so many major Texas cities with the most important port city in Texas made it a valuable acquisition. An interesting transaction occurred in 1897, which is proof of the line's continuing growth. The GC&SF; company and Fred Harvey, a famous railroad restaurateur, made an agreement. Harvey Restaurants and Harvey Houses, a hotel chain, soon dotted the AT&SF;, providing inexpensive, comfortable dining for the patrons of the line. Both the restaurants and the railway have been celebrated in song, literature, and the entertainment media. 20th century AT&SF; Union Station in Galveston, Texas. GC&SF; also participated in Galveston's efforts to raise the city after the 1900 Galveston hurricane. In 1904, the board granted Goedhart and Bates a five-year lease to a strip of land on the east end of the Gulf Company in Galveston, which would be used for canal purposes in connection with the grade-raising of the city. In 1908 GC&SF;, along with other railroads, worked to build a new causeway from Galveston to the mainland. Construction of a 98-mile branch line from Lometa through San Saba and Brady to Eden was commenced in 1910 and completed by the end of the following year. By 1912, AT&SF; announced plans to build a new union depot in Galveston that would also house the offices of GC&SF.; Their plans were for an eight-story fireproof building made of steel- reinforced concrete and faced with white enameled brick. The waiting room would be 104 feet by 63 feet, and the building would be large enough to contain all of the departments of the GC&SF.; An addition to the building was made in 1932, which included another eight-story building and an eleven-story tower. The company planned to spend $35,000 on remodeling the old building so that it would match the new structure. GC&SF; also boasted of a new electric boiler plant, which would heat the entire building. In 1937, AT&SF; purchased the Fort Worth & Rio Grande Railway from SLSF and immediately leased it to GC&SF;, thus gaining a valuable and shorter route to Fort Worth from the west and from the livestock-raising areas of the Edwards Plateau than the previous routing via Temple. After World War II, AT&SF; worked to expand its freight lines. The company used special trains to haul specific cargo. One of these trains was the 1949 Cotton Special, established to move the West Texas cotton crop from Lubbock to the Galveston wharves. By the 1960s AT&SF; worked with different corporations to expand. In one such instance AT&SF; agreed to work with the Duval Corporation to develop a sulfur mine at Rustler Springs, Texas. AT&SF; built a 30-mile branch line and conceived the ingenious idea of transporting the sulfur in a molten state from the mine to Galveston, where it would then be shipped by sea. This would make the sulfur easier to move over such a long distance. The sulfur was heated to 290 degrees and transported by tank car. This worked so well that the company bought three trains of 66 cars each, and a train moved continuously over the 930-mile run. By this time, the identity of the GC&SF; had become intertwined with that of AT&SF.; In 1965, the remaining property of the Gulf division was conveyed to the AT&SF; company.

Thompson and lyrics by Charles H. Taylor. After a run in Manchester, England, the opera opened in London at the Apollo Theatre on 17 April 1907 for an initial run of 110 performances. It starred Ruth Vincent as Sophia and Hayden Coffin as Tom Jones. The piece also had a provincial tour and a popular Broadway run in 1907. It then disappeared from the professional repertory but eventually became very popular with amateur groups. Background and productions The impresario Robert Courtneidge, noting the bicentennial of Fielding's birth in 1907, decided to adapt Fielding's novel as a comic opera. He commissioned Thompson and Taylor to collaborate on the libretto and German to write the music. The eroticism of the novel was reduced for Edwardian audiences. The influences of German's predecessor, Arthur Sullivan can be seen in the opera's patter songs and the pseudo-madrigal, \\"Here‚Äôs a paradox for lovers\\". However, the extended finales and much of the other music, as well as the orchestration shows German's own more romantic style.Detailed liner notes and information about the 2009 recording The opera premiered at the Prince's Theatre in Manchester, England, on 3 April 1907, opening in London at the Apollo Theatre on 17 April 1907 for an initial run of 110 performances. It starred Ruth Vincent as Sophia and Hayden Coffin as Tom Jones. Carrie Moore played Honour, and the comedian Dan Rolyat played Partridge. The producer's daughter, Cicely Courtneidge, made her professional d√©but in the small r√¥le of Rosie. Costume designs were by C. Wilhelm.\\"Mr. Pitcher's Art\\" ‚Äì Obituary The Times 3 March 1925 Audiences and critics both received Tom Jones enthusiastically. The critic Neville Cardus wrote, \\"Next morning I heard over and over again in my head most of the melodies ... I savoured the orchestration ... I returned to Tom Jones night after night; I sold several of my precious books to obtain admission\\". Tom Jones was still playing strongly at the Apollo when it closed after 110 performances. It would have run longer, but Courtneidge had already booked a provincial tour with the same cast. The piece also had a popular Broadway run at the Astor Theatre beginning on 11 November 1907, which interpolated the song \\"King Neptune\\" from German's 1902 comic opera, Merrie England, into the third act. It then disappeared from the professional repertory. Due to the perceived raciness of the original novel even into the 20th century, the opera was initially avoided by amateur performing groups, but eventually reached a level of popularity comparable to Merrie England. A few modern performing groups such as the Shaw Festival have found the libretto to be an excessively diluted version of the original novel and have produced rewritten versions with revised lyrics and dialogue. Richard Traubner asked in Opera News: > But does a Tom Jones that pleased a refined Edwardian clientele still hold > up, especially after Tony Richardson's famous 1963 film version...?

Tom is in love with Sophia, Squire Western's daughter, but her father wishes her to marry Blifil, Allworthy's nephew and heir. Tom's feelings for Sophia are reciprocated. Western's trouble-making sister accuses Tom of impropriety with Sophie's maid, Honour, but this false accusation is rebutted and Honour pairs up with Gregory, a local youth. Blifil also attempts to slur Tom's honourable reputation, but Honour outwits him. Blifil proposes to Sophia, but is rejected. He and Tom come to blows, and Tom knocks him down. Western angrily rejects Tom's plea for Sophia's hand. Allworthy disowns Tom, and Sophia is in disgrace with Squire Western. Act 2 - The Inn at Upton Sophia, accompanied by Honour, has run away, intending to seek refuge with Lady Bellaston, her cousin, in London. Blifil and Squire Western arrive at the inn in pursuit. There they meet Benjamin Partridge, the village barber and quack-doctor, who, it emerges, knows something about the foundling Tom's birth. Sophia and Honour arrive, but they and their pursuers remain unaware of each other's presence. Next to arrive is Tom, with Lady Bellaston, whom he has rescued from highwaymen. She is much taken with her gallant rescuer, and Sophia, believing Tom to be false, leaves at once. He sets off in pursuit of her. Act 3 - Ranelagh Gardens Sophia has gone to live with her cousin, Lady Bellaston, and is well established in London society. Tom finds Sophia, who eventually realises that she has been mistaken in doubting his fidelity to her. Partridge has told Western the secret of Tom's birth: he is Allworthy's elder nephew and heir, and Western now gladly consents to Tom and Sophia's marriage.

His brothers were the well-known folklorists, Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm.  Life and work  He was born in Hanau and developed an interest in nature early in life. His studies began at the Kunsthochschule Kassel and he took lessons from Philip Otto Runge. From 1809 to 1817, he studied at the newly founded Academy of Fine Arts Munich, interrupted only by a brief stint as an officer in the 1814 campaign against Napoleon and a study trip to Italy in 1816. While there, he learned engraving from Carl Ernst Christoph Hess. Upon completion of his studies, he published his first work; a sketchbook of engravings based on his Italian journey. He also contributed the frontispiece for the second edition of Kinder- und Hausm√§rchen (Grimm's Fairy Tales) in 1819. Thanks to his brothers' connections to the academic community in G√∂ttingen, he was able to secure commissions for two series of portraits of scholars, professors and doctors; the first in 1823 and the second in 1826. In between, he helped Gerhardt Wilhelm von Reutern found the artists' colony in Willingshausen. He became a Professor of history painting at the Kassel Academy in 1832. Two years after his first wife's death in 1842, he married the daughter of Reform theologian . In 1860, health problems made it increasingly difficult to draw. He died of pneumonia in 1863 in Kassel. Since 2012, the city of Hanau has awarded the \\"Ludwig Emil Grimm Prize\\" to young artists. In March 2014, a life- size bronze statue of him was dedicated there in front of the \\"Zum Riesen\\" hotel as a gift to the city from the hotel's owners. It was designed by the painter .

A part of the municipality of Amfikleia-Elateia, in Phiotis, GreeceKallikratis law Greece Ministry of Interior , it had a population of 630 in 2011, and is situated 156 km from Athens. Geography Tithorea, located on the slopes of Mount Parnassus ,Oreivatein.com the mountain was sacred to Dionysus and the Dionysian mysteries; it was also sacred to Apollo and the Corycian nymphs and was the home of the Muses. Tithorea is situated at the northern foot of the Parnassus, 5 km from Tithorea Train Station,90 minutes,156Km,from the country capital Athens. TITHOREA (Velitsa) Ancient Phokis.Tithorea is about one hundred and eighty stades distant from Delphi on the road across Parnassus. This road is not mountainous throughout, being fit even for vehicles, but was said to be several stades longer. Tithorea, considered the birthplace of the Phocians, where about 2000 BC, Phocus and his wife Antiopi settled, where they lived and died and were buried.Tithorea (Neon),is the starting point and co- founders,along with other cities in the Boeotian Kifissos, Phocaea, a colony on the coast of Asia Minor,opposite Chios, under the Athenian Philogenes. Lampsacus was one of the first colonies in the Black Sea, Marseilles, Antipolis, Nicaea, Arelati (present-day Arles), Agathi, Hierapolis, Monoikos, present-day Monaco, present-day southern France, Elea in south Italy, Olvia in Sardinia and Kallipoli (Barcelona).The Tithorians, along with the other Phocians, were the only ones from the central and northern Greek states who did not get the side of the Persians when Xerxes marched against Greece and participated with a remarkable army in the battle of Thermopylae.Tithorea was the operational center of Onomarhos,born near Tithorea in the settlement of Parapotamioi, Emperor of the Phocians,the most powerful personality of Greece from 353 BC to 352 BC, where at that time it had occupied Thronio in Locri, subjugated Amfissa, conquered Doric Tetrapolis and Orchomenos. The Phocians King Onomarchos, led the entire Phocian army and invaded Thessaly twice (354-353 BC), where after an equal number of victories forced Philip to return back to Macedonia, but Onomarchos in the third match, with the Macedonians had a fatal end to the battle that took place at Krokion Field near the Pagasitic Gulf,where the Phocian forces were defeated and the Onomarchos killed during the battle.Philip, in retaliation for the defeats suffered by the Phocians in 338 BC, conquered and leveled the Phocian cities. It has been identified by 3d and 2d c. B.C. inscriptions, dated by the archon of Tithorea. Several refer to Isis, Serapis, and Anubis, recalling the sanctuary that Pausanias (10.32) said was the holiest of those built to Isis in Greece. Varying opinions have arisen from Herodotos' statement, that a number of Phocians fleeing Xerxes took refuge on the isolated peak of Tithorea, near Neon.Tithorea referring to the heights above the great cliff rising S of the village, later applied by extension to the whole district. Others, however, have supposed Tithorea was the refuge site, and that Neon is to be identified with the remains of a walled site of considerable size at Palia Pheva on the right bank of the Kephissos about 5 km to the N. Plutarch,described Tithorea as merely a fortress in the early 1st c. B.C. but of much greater importance a century later.It had declined again by the time of Pausanias, who saw a theater, an ancient market, a Temple and Grove of Athena, and the tomb of Antiope and Phocos. In the vicinity, there was also a Temple of Asklepios Archagetos (Founder). Scattered theater seats have been noted outside the walls as well as other foundations for large buildings. The most important remains are those of the fortifications, classed with Messene and Eleutherai as the finest examples of 4th c. work. The walls, supplementing the natural defenses of cliff to the S and gorge to the E, are of trapezoidal ashlar masonry, as much as 14 courses high. On the steep W slope, the top is both inclined and stepped, and crowned with coping blocks. The towers are square with windows and loopholes. Neon is listed by Pausanias as one of the Phocian towns razed in 346 B.C.; the walls were probably rebuilt soon after the battle of Chaironeia eight years later.The local olive oil was noted for color and sweetness and well known across Greece.In inscription stated that in Tithorea lived and died the famous Alexandrian medical doctor Dorotheos. In Diogenes Laertius,stated in his work \\"Lives of Philosophers\\",that Tithorea gave the birth to a philosopher, in the 4th century BC,which was called Theon the Tithoreus. The people of Velitsa (Tithorea),took part,with a 47-member percussion group members, during the battle of Arachova on November 18 and 24, 1826,as well with a lower participation under Sergeant Vagenas and Athanasakos,at the exit of Messolonghi.In Velitsa (Tithorea),was the base of Odysseas Androutsos, hero of the Greek liberation,against Turkish.Tithorea was the origin of the admiral of independence,Russian army officer, Catherine the Great,Empress of Russia lover Lambros Katsonis. Tithorea in the post- liberation period and prior to that name Velitsa, was established on 18.10.1835,as a settlement of the prefecture of Attica and Boeotia.During the German-Italian occupation, the Velitsiotes, along with the other villages, took part in one of the largest sabotages in central Greece, in Palavitsa, between Amfikleia-Tithoreas, on April 16, 1943, which cost Rommel the supply,for 12 days and influenced the development of World War II. After a few days, the Italian army entered Velitsa and the people of Velitsa paying for their brave act,a heavy blood cost.Velitsa (Tithorea) was looted,the village was burned, in retaliation for the sabotage in Palavitsa and by indiscriminately firing, killed the people of Velitsa: Gazis Christos father's name Andreas, Kaperonis Ioannis fathe's Konstantinos, Trifylli Kalliopi of fatner's name Ioannis,Stafyla Panayiou and the teacher Yiannis Galanis. The economy of Tithorea was predominantly tobacco-producing, livestock-based, with mills, a class of food merchants, shoemakers, barbers, tailors, craftsmen, builders and ironworkers.The Gymnasium of Tithorea operated for decades with students as Academician Georgios Sklavounos, the defence Minister Giannakitas,during the period of the Balkan Wars, the founder of Finos Film,F.Finos, Deputy Minister of Agriculture of C.Triantafylou,Deputy President of court of auditors Ev.Gialouris.Tithorea is the place of origin of Stathis Giotas, former Minister the PASOK periods. usTITHOREA (Velitsa) Phokis, Greece, entry in The Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites.),Name changes of settlements in Greece The anient city of Tithorea was built after the destruction of the nearby cities, including Neon, by Xerxes' Persian army in 480 BC.

Being \\"judgment proof\\" is not a defense to a lawsuit. If sued, the defendant cannot claim being \\"judgment proof\\" as an affirmative defense. The term \\"judgment proof\\" instead refers to the inability of the judgment holder to obtain satisfaction of the judgment. If a plaintiff were to secure a legal judgment against an insolvent defendant, the defendant's lack of funds would make the satisfaction of that judgment difficult, if not impossible, to secure. Exempt assets Some income and assets are exempt from being accessed to pay a judgment. If a judgment debtor has income, it may be possible to get an order of garnishment to collect a judgment from that source of income. However, if the debtor's income is low or if the debtor is already subject to garnishment, in order to prevent the impoverishment of the debtor, the debtor's income may be exempt from additional garnishment. Some states do not permit wage garnishment. If the debtor is living on income from social security benefits, a retirement pension, or other social welfare, garnishment may not be possible, as such income is usually protected against garnishment by creditors. Cost of collection The cost of collecting a judgment may also contribute to an assessment of whether a debtor is judgment-proof. If the amount that a judgment holder is able to collect from the debtor is insufficient to cover ongoing legal expenses and related costs of collection, collection efforts become uneconomical.

The Chestertown Tea Party was a protest against British excise duties which, according to local legend,Goodheart, Adam, Tea & Fantasy, The American Scholar Vol 74, 21‚Äì34 took place in May 1774 in Chestertown, Maryland as a response to the British Tea Act. Chestertown tradition holds that, following the example of the more famous Boston Tea Party, colonial patriots boarded the brigantine Geddes in broad daylight and threw its cargo of tea into the Chester River.

Background=Relations with England In 1767 in an effort to raise money for England by taxing the thirteen colonies, Parliament passed the Townshend Acts, as part of a series of other acts, including the Sugar Act, Stamp Act, and Coercive Acts. The Townshend Acts placed taxes on several important items in the Colonial economy including paper, paint, lead, glass and tea. Reaction to the Townshend Acts in the thirteen colonies was so negative that on March 5, 1770, Parliament decided to repeal most of the duties, however, they decided that the tax on tea would remain. As a result, many colonists refused to buy (boycotted) tea that came to America from England. Instead they smuggled in tea from other countries or made their own tea from local spices. Soon merchants in England began to lose money, especially the East India Company. In order to keep this company from going bankrupt, Parliament passed the Tea Act of 1773. For reasons of economics and social liberty, the colonists were outraged and the seeds of dissent began to grow in the New World. Beginnings in Boston On December 16, 1773, a group of angry rebels calling themselves the \\"Sons of Liberty\\" protested the Tea Act and disguised as Mohawk natives boarded three ships in Boston Harbor loaded with tea and proceeded to dump 92,000 pounds of tea into the ocean. King George III reacted to the \\"tea party\\" by ordering the closing of the port of Boston. While Boston's was by far the most famous tea party that occurred in the colonies, it was only the first of many protests against the Tea Act that took place along the Atlantic Coast. Events in Chestertown When news of the closing of the port of Boston reached the Chesapeake Bay port of Chester Town, (now Chestertown) on the Eastern Shore of Maryland in the spring of 1774, town leaders called a meeting to discuss what actions should be taken. The local chapter of the Sons of Liberty boldly put forth a list of grievances, which became known as the \\"Chestertown Resolves\\". These stated that it was unlawful to buy, sell, or drink tea shipped from England. The \\"Resolves\\" are a matter of historic record, reported in the Maryland Gazette, but for the tossing of tea, there is no contemporary evidence; the earliest record dates to the end of 19th century. The Chestertown Tea Party nonetheless remains a major part of local tradition and a source of civic identity. Shortly after the Resolves were printed, word came to the citizens that a ship in the local harbor, the brigantine Geddes, had come to port with a shipment of tea. According to tradition, on May 23, 1774 a small group of men (unlike their brethren in New England, in broad daylight and without Indian disguise) forcibly boarded the ship and threw its cargo into the Chester River. Chestertown Resolves 1st ‚Äì RESOLVED, that we acknowledge his majesty George III, King of Great Britain, France and Ireland, to be our rightful and lawful sovereign to whom we owe and promise all dutiful allegiance and submission. 2nd ‚Äì RESOLVED, that no duties or taxes can constitutionally be imposed on us, but by our own consent, given personally, or by our representatives. 3rd ‚Äì RESOLVED, that the act of the British parliament of the 7th of George III, chapter 46, subjecting the colonies to the payment of a duty on tea, for the purpose of raising a revenue in America, is unconstitutional, oppressive and calculated to enslave the Americans. 4th ‚Äì RESOLVED, therefore, that whoever shall import, or in any way aid or assist in importing, or introducing from any part of Great Britain, or any other place whatsoever, into this town or country, any tea subject to the payment of a duty imposed by the aforesaid act of Parliament. Or, whoever shall wilfully and knowingly sell, buy or consume, or in any way assist in the sale, purchase, or consumption of any tea imported as aforesaid subject to a duty, he, or they, shall be stigmatized as enemies to the liberties of America. 5th ‚Äì RESOLVED, that we will not only steadily adhere to the foregoing resolves, but will endeavor to excite our worthy neighbors to a like patriotic conduct, and whoever, amongst us, shall refuse his concurrence, or after complying, shall desert the cause, and knowingly deviate from the true spirit and meaning of these our resolutions, we will mark him out as inimical to the liberties of America, an unworthy member of the community, and a person not deserving our notice or regard. 6th ‚Äì RESOLVED, that the foregoing resolves be printed, that our brethren in this and the other colonies, may know our sentiments as they are therein contained. Signed by order of the Committee, W. Wright, Clerk Historic impact The events in Chester Town as well as others in port cities like Boston, Annapolis and Charleston, SC, marked a turning point in relations between England and the thirteen colonies. After these \\"tea parties\\", it was clear that the colonists were deeply committed to opposing taxes they viewed as unfair. The destruction of British tea was a defiant act against Parliament and King George and viewed by the Crown as treason. The once distinct and autonomous colonies became united under the resolution that they would not accept \\"taxation without representation\\" in any form, and that they were willing to act forcefully to protect that right. Historic record and authenticity The authenticity of the Chestertown Tea Party has been questioned by historians, who have been able to find no record prior to the very end of the nineteenth century.Goodheart, Adam, op. cit. The first mention of a \\"tea party\\" dates from 1899, in a booklet about Chestertown by Fred G. Usilton called History of Chestertown: Gem City on the Chester. Usilton was involved with the local newspaper, which was edited by his father. Usilton gives no source for his story. Despite efforts to find primary sources (letters, diaries, news accounts) this remains the earliest account. It was picked up in a state of Maryland publication in 1903. Usilton's tale ‚Äì which could have been nothing more than patriotic embroidery for the Chestertown Resolves ‚Äì appears to have gained currency in 1906, Chestertown's 200th anniversary. In 1915, Usilton published a county history which included the tale. In the 1950s, newspaper editor Bill Usilton (Fred's son) revived the story for the town's 250th anniversary. Later, Bill Usilton expanded on the 1915 history book and the Tea Party tale was included. Through all those years, however, no additional documentation was presented.For a thorough treatment of the Chestertown Tea Party and its origins, see Tempest in a Tea Party by Craig O'Donnell in Tales of Kent County, Volume 1 (Kent County News, Chestertown Md., 2006) pages 6 to 10. Contemporary news accounts of protests and destruction in 1774 are documented in New York; Yorktown, Va., and Annapolis. Chestertown, at the time, was a major commercial center, but Colonial newspapers are silent about the legendary tea-dumping. A strand remains. The \\"Brigantine Geddes\\" bears the name of a respected local merchant and collector of customs, William Geddes. She was built in 1773, in Chestertown. Surviving port records show the ship was in the Chesapeake around the time of the legendary tea party, having returned from a voyage to Europe that began the previous fall. The owner is listed as James Nicholson and the captain, John Harrison.See Maryland ports-of-entry records, 1745-1775. Annapolis, Chester, Oxford, Patuxent, and Pocomoke ..., microfilm at the Maryland Historical Society. Geddes was in the vicinity between about May 7 and May 24, when she cleared customs outbound for Madeira. So part of the legend can be documented. There was a brig Geddes and it was in the area in May 1774. It remains uncertain whether tea was aboard.Goodheart, Adam, op. cit. Tea Party Festival In the spring of 1968 the citizens of Chestertown staged the first festival to commemorate the actions of their forefathers. The event that year was very small by current standards, but included a parade and historic staging of the events of the fateful day. With a few years off, the Tea Party Festival has continued every Memorial Day Weekend in earnest since the Bicentennial year of 1976. The current incarnation is showcased by a large colonial parade down High Street, featuring numerous fife and drum bands as well as marching Colonial and British re-enactors. Local civic clubs offer indigenous cuisine (favorites include cold beer, hot corn, crab cakes and funnel cakes). Craftsmen from around the country ply their wares while musicians, puppeteers and dancers entertain the crowds of as many as 15,000 until the first day culminates with the throng gathering on the bank of the Chester River to cheer for the historic reenactment of the Storming of the Geddes. Colonial re-enactors use the schooner Sultana (a 1768 replica) and they are thrown overboard with the tea. Other events at the annual event include a cocktail party, homegrown music, historic home tours, the tossing of a major town figure into the river, 10-mile and 5K runs, and a raft race. It is the town's biggest weekend of the year as tourists and residents fill the streets strolling among booths filled with crafts and food and witnessing history.

Education Derek Bryan was the son of a well-established dentist in Norwich, Herman Bryan, the other children being three sisters. After attending Gresham's School, Holt, from 1924 to 1929, he went up to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge. His lifelong diffidence regarding scholarly pursuits was already evident, but he finally settled on modern languages for his degree. At both Gresham's and Cambridge he was acquainted with Donald Maclean; one story he liked to tell was of looking up Maclean at the Foreign Office when later on home leave from China, with Maclean emerging to declare, \\"We have lost Franco.\\" Career After Cambridge, Bryan was again uncertain what to do, but was steered in the direction of taking the examinations for the Open Competition for the Civil Service. As he liked to tell it, he passed just high enough to be offered the last post going, a student-interpretership in the China branch of the Consular Service. Sailing for China in December 1932, a week before turning twenty-two, an active career followed taking in postings in various parts of China, including Macao during part of the Japanese incursion. He acted as private secretary to the British Ambassador, Sir Archibald Clark-Kerr on a second posting in Chongqing in 1941, rising to be Chinese Secretary in the British Embassy in Peking. He was a fluent linguist and made many friends in progressive Chinese circles. In the Summer of 1936, when first posted in Chongqing, he joined a memorable walking expedition in Western Sichuan towards the Tibetan border in the company of Julian Bell, Yeh Chun Chan (Ye Junjian) and the geologist J. B. (Jack) Hanson-Lowe (who made a more extensive exploration of the region the following year). In 1943, he married Liao Hong-Ying (1905‚Äì1998), who was then working for the British Council in China. Liao had read chemistry at Somerville College, Oxford, coming into close contact with Dorothy Crowfoot (Dorothy Hodgkin). Joseph Needham, then serving as British Scientific Adviser in China, recommended Bryan to Liao when she was due to visit Lanzhou where Bryan was consul. In the 1950s, Bryan and Liao were to accompany a delegation including Dorothy Hodgkin on, at that period, a rare visit to the People's Republic of China. It was also through Liao that Bryan came to be increasingly involved with the Quakers; his administrative experience was especially appreciated by the Quaker Meeting in Norwich and he served a term as co-clerk of the Meeting. Bryan had, however, grown up in the Church of England, retaining a special affection for Norwich Cathedral. On finally moving back to Norwich, he was able to find expression for this again, together with an engagement with the St. Julian's Church, which was only a short distance from the Bryans' home on Southgate Lane. For Liao, it had been a visit to Jordans, coupled with the personal support of Margery Fry, who, as Principal, had admitted her to Somerville, that had first drawn her to the Quakers. The Bryans were married in Chengdu after the Quaker custom and stayed with Margery Fry on their first return as a couple from China. As Chinese Secretary, he helped to resolve the Yangtse Incident of April 1949, when the British warship HMS Amethyst was caught off-guard on Yangtze River behind the rapidly advancing lines of the People's Liberation Army. While his assistant, Edward Youde, later to serve as Governor of Hong Kong, achieved popular recognition for cycling behind those lines to make contact with the Amethyst, it was Bryan who was sent to take a lecture on gun-boat diplomacy from Huang Hua. Bryan was never a communist and would chuckle in recalling the blandishments of those who had encouraged him to join the Communist Party, only themselves to fall away, especially after 1956. Nevertheless, he was candid in his sympathies for the Chinese in the circumstances China faced, reflecting the practicality of the consular official, rather than the valiant discretion of the diplomat. While serving as the British Consul in Peking, he called for the admission of the People's Republic to the United Nations a generation before the Americans stopped vetoing it, and in 1951, during the Korean War, he said he approved of Mao's social reforms. Although Bryan had served in China almost continuously for eighteen years and was then the Foreign Office's most able sinalogue, the early 1950s were a period of heightened political sensitivity and it was decided to offer Bryan the post of Commercial Attache in Lima, Peru. Bryan activated the early retirement provision, largely out of consideration for his wife. The move accelerated the careers of younger colleagues such as Youde, but also left confusion in the minds of those not familiar with the full story, clouding Bryan's standing with some (such as Youde's predecessor as Governor of Hong Kong, Murray MacLehose). Bryan's initial plans, again reflecting his wife's inclinations, were to undertake research on Chinese literature back at Cambridge. But, chaffing again with scholarship, perhaps more particularly with his chosen topic, the writer Lu Xun, he turned to more active organisational work, for instance, playing a leading role in the Britain-China Friendship Association. With Joseph Needham, who was by now concentrating on the history Chinese science, he established the Society for Anglo-Chinese Understanding (SACU), which for some years provided the only way for the British to visit the People's Republic. Bryan and Liao also took to spending alternating periods in the UK and the PRC. In 1963, he began to teach Chinese at Holborn College, later part of the University of Westminster. In 1974 he founded a degree course in modern Chinese there. Their base in China was in Chengdu. Bryan retired in 1978, moving back to Norwich, his birthplace, from 1988. Bryan and Liao were often joined in Norwich by her biographer, Innes Herdan (n√©e Jackson; note also Chiang Yee), who had been with Liao at Wuhan University after their studies at Somerville College; Herdan continued this association with Bryan after Liao's death. Bryan developed conflicting health problems after a long-haul flight from Hong Kong on returning from being a guest in Peking for the fiftieth anniversary in 1999 of the establishment of the PRC. He suffered a stroke in 2002, from which he never fully recovered. In his will, he funded scholarships for graduate students from China at the University of East Anglia, continuing the hospitality he and Liao had commenced on return to Norwich in having Chinese students stay with them for extended periods. Under the guidance of Innes Herdan, the papers of Derek Bryan and Liao Hongying are now in the Special Collections library of the School of Oriental and African Studies, London (see the Archive Catalogue under PP MS 99).https://blogs.soas.ac.uk/archives/2017/04/20/the-personal- papers-of-derek-bryan-consular-official-and-teacher/ Bryan himself had intended all their books and papers to go to the Needham Research Institute, in Cambridge, honoring their close association, indeed their union on account of, Joseph Needham. Bryan was always somewhat inhibited in discussing his career, out of respect for the Official Secrets Act. Nevertheless, at the time of his death, Bryan had been working up an extended biographical sketch, based on his diaries kept in spidery handwriting in a series of little black notebooks. This work appears to have been mislaid or otherwise lost, in contrast to his own scrupulous orderliness with papers throughout his working life. The last years were truly a great trial to someone who, not hitherto having known illness, had always administered their affairs with executive dispatch. Editor From 1963 to 1965, Bryan was the founding editor of Arts and Sciences in China, a journal of Chinese studies published in London. Among the members of the Editorial Board were J. D.

Wagner College, located on Staten Island, is the third. The trophy was dedicated a year after the Columbia-Fordham game was postponed following the attacks of September 11, 2001. At least 43 Columbia alumni and 39 Fordham alumni and students died at the World Trade Center.Berkow, Ira. \\"Reflections on Making the Proper Decision Over Postponing a Game.\\" The New York Times Sept. 12, 2002. They included two former Fordham football players: Nick Brandemarti '00 and Kevin Szocik '97. The most recent game of the series was played in 2015. Background Despite their proximity and long football histories, the schools met only three times in the 100 years up to 1990. The first matchup took place in 1890, and another followed in 1902. Both contests were lopsided shutout wins by Columbia. Competing at different levels, the schools did not meet again but Fordham moved up to the Major/University level in 1928. Aside from a hiatus over the 1943-1945 seasons due to World War II, Fordham stayed in the Division I ranks until the 1954 season. During that time, however, contests against Columbia and most other \\"Ancient Eight\\" teams were shunned as Fordham played a more national schedule. National aspirations ended following the 1954 season when after a string of losing seasons and, citing financial concerns, Fordham folded its football program. Varsity football was re-introduced at what is now known as the Division III level in 1970. Columbia, along with the rest of the Ivy League, still playing at what is now known as the FBS level (more like a lower level G5 FBS in terms of computer power ratings), scheduled Fordham in 1972 as a replacement for Buffalo which, at the time, had temporarily terminated its football program. Like their previous two contests, the 1972 affair also ended in a lopsided shutout win for the Lions. Once again, competing at different levels kept the schools from establishing a series. After decades of poor results, Columbia, along with the entire Ivy League, was relegated into what is now known as the FCS level by the NCAA following the 1981 season. Fordham moved up to that same I-AA level prior to the 1989 season. This put the 1991 encounter between the two on a more even footing. Fordham won that fourth meeting by a 20-16 score. Columbia gained revenge in sweeping the next four contests, which were played in 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1996. After a brief hiatus, the two renewed their series in 2000, which was typically used to open Columbia's season and was usually the third game on Fordham's schedule. Origin Of the Liberty Cup Liberty Trophy in 2015 The 10th meeting between Fordham and Columbia originally was scheduled for September 15, 2001. In the days following the September 11, 2001 attacks, Major League Baseball, the National Football League and many NCAA Division I teams canceled games for the following weekend. But Fordham and Columbia ‚Äî the only Division I football teams in New York City at the time ‚Äî debated as late as Friday, September 14, 2001 about the possibility of playing. Fordham officials wanted to send a message about American resilience in the face of the attacks, but Columbia officials argued that it was too soon to think about playing a football game. \\"The question was, should we not play and mourn and honor our dead, or was normalcy in the face of this disaster the best response?\\" said the Rev. Joseph A. O'Hare, president of Fordham at that time. The schools decided against playing on Sept. 15, but later in the season agreed to meet on Thanksgiving morning (November 22, 2001). Fordham thumped Columbia 41-10 before a surprisingly ample crowd considering the holiday and early start time. Afterwards, O'Hare said it had been the right decision to reschedule. \\"Oh, absolutely,\\" he said. \\"I think we had put sports in perspective -- and we played great.\\" Less than 10 months after that game, the underdog Lions gained their revenge, holding Fordham close for 59 minutes before winning with a 37-yard field goal with 10.5 seconds to play. This was the inaugural Liberty Cup game. The 13-11 victory would be Columbia‚Äôs only win of the 2002 season; Fordham would finish 10-3, gaining a share of the Patriot League title and reaching the quarterfinals of the NCAA Football Championship Subdivision playoffs. Columbia Band's altar boy joke controversy The Columbia University Marching Band drew protests from Fordham and Roman Catholics generally with an off-color double entendre reference to the priest abuse scandal during its halftime performance at the inaugural 2002 Liberty Cup game, when the Columbia band's self-appointed \\"Poet Laureate\\" read from a script over the stadium's public address system: > \\"As well as the Mets' season going up in smoke, Fordham tuition going down > like an altar boy, and the Fordham football team with a threat rating of a > cute, neon pink, the band now presents an all-star gala halftime salute to > more Columbia news.\\" In reporting the incident, The New York Times, the Associated Press, and most of the mainstream media found the reference to be too insensitive or offensive and refused to print it.Wolper, Allan.

Columbia took the 2006 meeting, 37-7, in the most lopsided result of the cup series until Fordham defeated Columbia 52-7 in 2013. The 2006 win was the Lions' second consecutive victory over Fordham, and made Norries Wilson the first Columbia coach since Aldo T. \\"Buff\\" Donelli to win his debut. Fordham responded by winning 8 of the next 9. Hiatus In 2014, after Columbia concluded a second consecutive 0-10 season, Columbia President Lee Bollinger commissioned former Boston University head football coach Rick Taylor to review the program. The following year, Taylor recommended Columbia improve its athletic facilities, increase salaries and discontinue the Fordham series. ‚ÄúThey should not play Fordham when Fordham has three games and scholarships under their belt,‚Äù Taylor said. ‚ÄúI'd take Fordham on anytime in the middle of the season when I got games under my belt.\\" Columbia did not schedule Fordham after 2015. ‚ÄúI would hope that some time in the next decade, Fordham comes back on the schedule,‚Äù Taylor said. ‚ÄúBecause that will prove that we were alright, and Columbia has succeeded.‚Äù As of the 2020 season Columbia has yet to face Fordham again. Columbia has however committed to other out-of-conference opponents through the 2020 season.

Career Jennings started his career at Tottenham Hotspur before joining UCD in January 2001 on a Sports Management Soccer Scholarship. He moved north to Derry City after several seasons at Belfield Park. He unsuccessfully tried to displace first choice keeper David Forde, but rejected offers to leave the club at the end of the 2005 season. Jennings was able to be the hero for Derry in the 2006 League of Ireland Cup final against Shelbourne as he came on from the substitute's bench to fill the place of Forde, who had been sent off in the 84th minute of play. The game went to penalties and Jennings saved all of the Shelbourne's attempts.

Based on a theoretical framework of neurodynamics that draws upon insights from chaos theory, he speculated that the currency of brains is primarily meaning, and only secondarily information. In \\"Societies of Brains\\" and in other writings, Freeman rejected the view that the brain uses representations to enable knowledge and behavior. Biography Walter Freeman was born in Washington, DC. His father was the lobotomist Walter Jackson Freeman II; his great-grandfather was William Williams Keen, the first brain surgeon in the United States. Freeman studied physics and mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, electronics in the Navy in World War II, philosophy at the University of Chicago, medicine at Yale University, internal medicine at Johns Hopkins, and neuropsychiatry at University of California, Los Angeles. He received his M.D. cum laude in 1954, the Bennett Award from the Society of Biological Psychiatry in 1964, a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1965, the MERIT Award from NIMH in 1990, and the Pioneer Award from the Neural Networks Council of the IEEE in 1992. He was a Professor Emeritus of Neurobiology at University of California, Berkeley. He was also the head of the international advisory council at the Bhaktivedanta Institute for advanced scientific research in consciousness. Freeman was President of the International Neural Network Society in 1994, and is a Life Fellow of the IEEE. He has authored over 450 articles and 4 books.

Initially at first there was reservation as to whether the LED system would throw enough light onto the stage. The new ArcSystem lighting was installed in 2015. By the spring of 2016 the acoustic shell, the movable wall portion of the stage that helps to amplify sounds coming from the orchestra was in need of major repairs. The mechanical system that lifts the walls up and out of the way when not in use were deemed to be dangerous to operate, lest it come crashing down. The acoustic shell has not operated since that time, until it is repaired or replaced. In the interim, amplification/reverb is created electronically. A Conceptual Development Plan was published in 2017. In it the MCCC will add another venue so that travelling shows could still use the Concert Hall while the WSO plays at a new Music Hall simultaneously. It was discovered in the spring of 2019 that the roof of the concert hall needs $15 million worth of roof repairs to the 51 year old venue. At the time, the lobby ceiling was constructed with asbestos. The Province has set aside funds to help pay for the repairs of the roof. Construction Governor General Roland Michener opened the Centennial Concert Hall 25 March 1968. The architects of the Hall were Green, Blankstein, Russell Assoc., Moody, Moore, Whenham & Partners, and Smith, Carter, Searle Associates, which are all located in Winnipeg. Theatre consultant George Izenour contributed to the design of the hall, and the acoustic engineering was by the firm of Bolt, Beranek & Newman Inc. The Winnipeg Architecture Foundation describes the design of the building as having a modern influence. The exterior design presents a balance of orthogonal lines and angles, glass and masonry, light cream and dark charcoal tones. The building's coloration complements and parallels those of the Winnipeg City Hall across Main Street ‚Äì which also features Tyndall stone and deep grey masonry.

It was recorded live in June 1965 at the Half Note Club in New York City and September 22, 1965 at Van Gelder Studios in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. The album combines guitarist Montgomery with the Miles Davis rhythm section from 1959‚Äì1963 of Wynton Kelly, Paul Chambers, and Jimmy Cobb. The album's versions of \\"Unit 7\\" and \\"Four on Six\\" have helped to establish these pieces as jazz standards. History Montgomery had performed numerous times previously with Kelly, and the trio of Kelly, Chambers, and Cobb had appeared on previous Montgomery albums for Riverside Records such as Full House. In the summer of 1965 the quartet toured the major jazz clubs in the US and also appeared at the Newport Jazz Festival on the afternoon of Sunday, July 4. Drummer Jimmy Cobb had previously toured briefly with Montgomery in an organ trio with Melvin Rhyne in 1963. The performance was part of Alan Grant's \\"Portrait In Jazz\\" series, and Grant is heard as the announcer. Only two of the original LP's five tracks were recorded at the Half Note -\\"No Blues\\" and \\"If You Could See Me Now.\\" At the behest of producer Creed Taylor, the other three were re-recorded three months later at Rudy Van Gelder's studio in New Jersey. In 1998, Verve reissued the show on disc two of Impressions: The Verve Jazz Sides with a scrambled track order and some crucial cuts. The first five tracks are from the original Verve LP. Tracks six through eleven are from the posthumously released Willow Weep for Me, without that album's string arrangements. Pat Metheny stated to The New York Times in 2005 that the solo on \\"If You Could See Me Now\\" from this album was his favorite of all time.  Reception  Allmusic jazz critic Jim Smith called the album \\"essential listening for anyone who wants to hear why Montgomery's dynamic live shows were considered the pinnacle of his brilliant and incredibly influential guitar playing.\\" and wrote that \\"Montgomery never played with more drive and confidence, and he's supported every step of the way by a genuinely smokin' Wynton Kelly Trio.\\" In his review for the Jazz Institute of Chicago, jazz author Stuart Nicolson extensively reviewed each song. He praised the album in general, writing \\"it was in jazz where his impact was most powerfully felt. His style and sound became the role-model for subsequent generations of guitar players and can be heard echoed in the playing of George Benson, Emily Remler, Bruce Forman, Pat Metheny, Mark Whitfield, Kevin Eubanks, and a host of others. These recordings go some way to illustrate why Montgomery turned the jazz world on its collective ear, the effects of which are still with us today.\\" Track listing Side 1 #\\"No Blues\\" (Miles Davis) ‚Äì 13:00 #\\"If You Could See Me Now\\" (Tadd Dameron, Carl Sigman) ‚Äì 6:45 Side 2 #\\"Unit 7\\" (Sam Jones) ‚Äì 7:30 #\\"Four on Six\\" (Montgomery) ‚Äì 6:45 #\\"What's New?\\" (Bob Haggart, Johnny Burke) ‚Äì 6:00  CD remaster 2005  #\\"No Blues\\" (Miles Davis) ‚Äì 12:57 #\\"If You Could See Me Now\\" (Tadd Dameron, Carl Sigman) ‚Äì 8:21 #\\"Unit 7\\" (Sam Jones) ‚Äì 6:44 #\\"Four on Six\\" (Montgomery) ‚Äì 6:43 #\\"What's New?\\" (Bob Haggart, Johnny Burke) ‚Äì 6:10 #\\"Willow Weep for Me\\" (Ann Ronell) ‚Äì 9:08 #\\"Portrait of Jennie\\" (Gordon Burdge, J.

An object diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML), is a diagram that shows a complete or partial view of the structure of a modeled system at a specific time.  Overview  In the Unified Modeling Language (UML), an object diagram focuses on some particular set of objects and attributes, and the links between these instances. A correlated set of object diagrams provides insight into how an arbitrary view of a system is expected to evolve over time. In early UML specifications the object diagram is described as: : \\"An object diagram is a graph of instances, including objects and data values. A static object diagram is an instance of a class diagram; it shows a snapshot of the detailed state of a system at a point in time. The use of object diagrams is fairly limited, namely to show examples of data structure.\\"Object Management Group (2001) UML specification 1.4, September 2001Anne Banks Pidduck, John Mylopoulos, Carson C. Woo (2002) Advanced Information Systems Engineering. p.776. The latest UML 2.5 specification does not explicitly define object diagrams,Classification of UML 2.5 Diagrams on uml-diagrams.org. Retrieved Dec 7, 2012 but provides a notation for instances of classifiers.Object Management Group (2015)UML specification 2.5, Section 9.8.4 on notation of InstanceSpecification, March 2015 Object diagrams and class diagrams are closely relatedMarcus Fontoura, Wolfgang Pree & Bernhard Rumpe (2002) The UML profile for framework architectures. p.19 and use almost identical notation.Kassem A. Saleh (2009) Software Engineering. p.47 Both diagrams are meant to visualize static structure of a system. While class diagrams show classes, object diagrams display instances of classes (objects).Bianca Scholten (2007) The Road to Integration: A Guide to Applying the ISA-95 Standard in Manufacturing. p.155 Object diagrams are more concrete than class diagrams. They are often used to provide examples or act as test cases for class diagrams. Only aspects of current interest in a model are typically shown on an object diagram. Object diagram topics=Instance specifications Each object and link on an object diagram is represented by an InstanceSpecification. This can show an object's classifier (e.g. an abstract or concrete class) and instance name, as well as attributes and other structural features using slots. Each slot corresponds to a single attribute or feature, and may include a value for that entity. The name on an instance specification optionally shows an instance name, a ':' separator, and optionally one or more classifier names separated by commas. The contents of slots, if any, are included below the names, in a separate attribute compartment. A link is shown as a solid line, and represents an instance of an association. Object diagram example Initially, when n=2, and f(n-2) = 0, and f(n-1) = 1, then f(n) = 0 + 1 = 1. Consider one possible way of modeling production of the Fibonacci sequence. In the first UML object diagram on the right, the instance in the leftmost instance specification is named v1, has IndependentVariable as its classifier, plays the NMinus2 role within the FibonacciSystem, and has a slot for the val attribute with a value of 0. The second object is named v2, is of class IndependentVariable, plays the NMinus1 role, and has val = 1. The DependentVariable object is named v3, and plays the N role. The topmost instance, an anonymous instance specification, has FibonacciFunction as its classifier, and may have an instance name, a role, and slots, but these are not shown here. The diagram also includes three named links, shown as lines. Links are instances of an association. After the first iteration, when n = 3, and f(n-2) = 1, and f(n-1) = 1, then f(n) = 1 + 1 = 2. In the second diagram, at a slightly later point in time, the IndependentVariable and DependentVariable objects are the same, but the slots for the val attribute have different values. The role names are not shown here. After several more iterations, when n = 7, and f(n-2) = 5, and f(n-1) = 8, then f(n) = 5 + 8 = 13. In the last object diagram, a still later snapshot, the same three objects are involved. Their slots have different values. The instance and role names are not shown here. Usage If you are using a UML modeling tool, you will typically draw object diagrams using some other diagram type, such as on a class diagram. An object instance may be called an instance specification or just an instance. A link between instances is generally referred to as a link. Other UML entities, such as an aggregation or composition symbol (a diamond) may also appear on an object diagram.

The fifteenth tropical or subtropical cyclone and fourteenth named storm of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season, Nicole developed on October 10 near Bermuda from a broad surface low that developed as a result of the interaction between an upper level trough and a decaying cold front. The storm turned to the northeast, passing close to Bermuda as it intensified to reach peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) on October 11. Deep convection developed near the center of the system as it attempted to become a fully tropical cyclone. However, it failed to do so and was absorbed by an extratropical cyclone late on October 11. Nicole dropped moderate amounts of rainfall in Bermuda, while rough seas caused problems for cruise lines. In Canada, the remnants of the storm combined with an extratropical storm to produce strong winds and heavy rainfall, which caused damage to trees and power lines. The remnant storm also produced gale-force winds across New England, while swells from the storm provided welcome surf conditions along the East Coast of the United States. Meteorological history An upper-level trough and a decaying cold front persisted across the western Atlantic Ocean in early October. The interaction between the two led to the formation of an area of low pressure on October 8 to the southwest of Bermuda. The system lacked a single well-defined circulation, though it possessed gale-force winds as it moved northwestward. The system gradually became better organized, and though there were no signs of tropical development on October 9, computer models suggested a subtropical storm could form. On October 10, a well-defined low-level circulation developed as a band of clouds formed in the northern portion of the system. Shortly thereafter, curved bands developed in the northwestern portion of the center, while the strongest winds associated with the storm occurred more than 115 miles (185 km) from the center. Based on the broad wind field and the cloud signature, it is estimated the system organized into Subtropical Storm Nicole on October 10 while located about 140 miles (225 km) southwest of Bermuda. The first National Hurricane Center forecast on Nicole noted the development of convection over the western portion of the center, and that if the trend continued, transitioning into a tropical cyclone would be possible. The first discussion also predicted a peak intensity of 65 mph (105 km/h). A mid-level trough turned the storm northeastward, and early on October 11 it passed about 60 miles (95 km) northwest of Bermuda. Shortly after passing Bermuda, Nicole developed persistent deep convection near the center, while Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit overpasses indicated the potential of a warm core within the system. Though Nicole attempted to acquire tropical characteristics, strong upper-level wind shear prevented the transition. As the storm accelerated northeastward under the influence of a large extratropical cyclone south of Nova Scotia, it briefly reached peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). Late on October 11, the circulation of Nicole became indistinguishable from the larger extratropical cyclone, and advisories on the system were discontinued at 18:00 UTC as Nicole was absorbed by the extratropical cyclone. Preparations, impact, and naming On October 9, one day prior to the storm's formation, the Bermuda Weather Service issued a gale warning for the island. The agency also issued a Tropical Storm Watch shortly after the storm developed. All warnings were canceled after the storm passed the island. Winds on Bermuda peaked at 44 mph (71 km/h) in association with Nicole, while gusts peaked at 60 mph (97 km/h) prior to the storm developing. Nicole and the precursor extratropical storm dropped heavy precipitation, amounting to 5.86 inches (148 mm) over a three-day period at the Bermuda International Airport. Thunderstorms were also reported on the island. Poor weather conditions from Nicole forced the cancellation of several events at the tourist-driven Bermuda Music Festival, including acts by Isaac Hayes, Gerald Albright, and Anita Baker. Strong winds knocked down power lines, leaving over 1,800 homes and businesses without power. Unsettled conditions also resulted in airport delays. High winds delayed or altered the courses of four cruise ships. High waves of 10 to 12 feet (3 to 3.6 m) in height left several cruise ship passengers seasick; one sick passenger was rushed to a local hospital on Bermuda. Subtropical Storm Nicole shortly after formation on October 10 The Canadian Hurricane Centre issued seven bulletins on the storm, though the system only briefly entered the centre's response zone before it dissipated. Due to moisture from Nicole combined with the extratropical storm, the Atlantic Storm Prediction Centre issued heavy rainfall and wind warnings for large portions of the Canadian Maritimes. The remnants of Nicole combined with a powerful extratropical cyclone to produce strong winds across the Maritimes. Winds gusted to hurricane-force on western Cape Breton, with the strongest gusts reaching 80 mph (130 km/h). The strong winds uprooted trees and downed power lines and combined with rough seas to cause cancellations for ferry crossings and restricted access to the Confederation Bridge. The storm complex also dropped over 2 inches (60 mm) of rainfall, causing flooding in eastern Nova Scotia. The storm's passage during the middle of apple harvest caused troubles for Annapolis Valley. The remnants of Nicole combined with an extratropical system to produce strong winds in New England, with gusts of up to 65 mph (105 km/h). In Maine, the winds snapped branches off trees, and also downed trees and power lines. Power outages were reported, primarily in coastal portions of Washington and Hancock Counties. Nicole produced moderate swells along the East Coast of the United States. Conditions for surfing were best in New York and Rhode Island, where swells of over 4 feet (1.2 m) occurred. Eleven ships reported tropical storm force winds in association with Subtropical Storm Nicole. The maximum recorded wind was 50 mph (80 km/h) while the storm was at peak intensity, while the minimum recorded pressure was 995 mbar as Nicole was being absorbed by the extratropical storm. Since 2002, subtropical storms have been assigned names from the predetermined list of names used for tropical cyclones. Nicole was the first named subtropical storm since the policy change that did not become a fully tropical cyclone. Hurricane Gustav in 2002 formed as and was named as a subtropical cyclone, although it later became a fully tropical cyclone and later strengthened into a hurricane. In 1972 and 1973, four subtropical storms were named using the Phonetic alphabet. All other subtropical cyclones remained unnamed.

As a painter on the forefront of the California Style School of painting, he was known for his urban and landscape paintings, as well as his graphic design work in the Hollywood film industry. He has won widespread critical acclaim and his works are included in over 50 public and private collections worldwide, including Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; Brooklyn Museum; deYoung Museum and Art Institute, Chicago. Overview Dong Kingman was born Dong Moy Shu in Oakland, California, the son of Chinese immigrants from Hong Kong. At the age of five and a half, he traveled with his family back to Hong Kong, where his father established a dry goods business. He began his formal education at the Bok Jai School, where he was given a school name in accordance with Chinese customs. Hearing that he aspired to be an artist, his instructor gave him the name \\"King Man\\" (lit. \\"scenery\\" and \\"composition\\" in Cantonese). He would later combine the two names into Kingman, placing his family name first in accordance with Chinese naming conventions, creating the name Dong Kingman. Kingman continued his education at the Chan Sun Wen School, where he excelled at calligraphy and watercolor painting. He studied under Szeto Wai, the Paris- trained head of the Lingnan Academy. It was under Szeto's instruction that Kingman was first exposed to Northern European trends. Kingman would later state that Szeto was his \\"first and only true influence.\\" Kingman returned to the United States in his late teens. In 1929 he attended the Fox Morgan Art School while holding down a variety of jobs. It was at this time that he chose to concentrate on watercolor painting. His critical breakthrough occurred in 1936, when he gained a solo exhibition at the San Francisco Art Association. This exhibition brought him national recognition and success. In the late 1930s, Kingman served as an artist in the Works Progress Administration, painting over 300 works with the relief program. In 1942 and 1944, Kingman received the Guggenheim Fellowship. During World War II, he was drafted into the U.S. Army, but was transferred to work as a map artist in the Office of Strategic Services at Camp Beal, California and Washington, D.C, by a fan of his work, Eleanor Roosevelt. Kingman settled in Brooklyn, New York after the war, where he held a position as an art instructor at Columbia University and Hunter College from 1946 for the next ten years. In New York he was associated with Midtown, Wildenstein and Hammer galleries. Kingman had married Janice Wong in 1926. She died in 1954 and he married the writer Helena Kuo in 1956. Kuo died in 1999. During the 1950s, Kingman served as a United States cultural ambassador and international lecturer for the Department of State. In the 1950s and 1960s, Kingman worked as an illustrator in the film industry, designing the backgrounds for a number of major motion pictures including \\"55 Days at Peking\\", The Sand Pebbles and the Hollywood adaptation of \\"Flower Drum Song\\". Over 300 of his film-related works are permanently housed at the Fairbanks Center for Motion Picture Study at the Margaret Herrick Library of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Beverly Hills, California. In 1981, Kingman made history as the first American artist to be featured in a solo exhibition following the resumption of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China when the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China hosted a critically acclaimed exhibition that drew over 100,000 people. The 1990s saw major exhibitions in Taiwan at the Taipei Modern Art Museum in 1995 and the Taichung Provincial Museum in 1999. Dong Kingman died of pancreatic cancer in his home in New York City in 2000, at age 89.http://articles.latimes.com/2000/may/17/local/me-31122 Dong Kingman; Watercolor Painter of Whimsical Cityscapes Documentary The 2011 Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival featured a unique interactive presentation of James Wong Howe's 1953 Dong Kingman film documentary.

The game received good reviews, and won an industry award. Gameplay The Creature That Ate Sheboygan, designed by Greg Costikyan, is a two-player combat-oriented game. In the best traditions of Japanese kaiju, a monster is going to climb out of Lake Michigan and attack Sheboygan, Wisconsin. One player takes the role of the monster, and designs the monster's destructive abilities. The other player takes the role of the police, fire fighters and military units that will be used to try to protect the city and destroy the monster. The players can choose several scenarios to enact. Every time the monster destroys a building or eliminates a human, it gains victory points. If the monster accrues the number of victory points called for in the scenario, the monster wins. If the humans destroy the monster before it reaches this threshold, the humans win. The game comes with a rectangular grid map of the town, a set of rules and tables, and a counter sheet. The counters included markers for police, fire fighters, military and unarmed civilians. There are several different monster counters, as well as damage and fire markers. Reception In the November 1979 edition of Dragon, Karl Merris liked the fact that the game was simple -- only four pages of rules -- and yet \\"This simplicity of game mechanics allows play to proceed quickly, often at breathtaking speed. Most scenarios can be played to completion in an hour or less. Yet despite its simplicity, the game is challenging and interesting.\\" The one weakness of the game Merris noted was when the monster was given a fire-breath weapon, for which there was no defense. Despite this, Merris recommended the game: \\"The Creature that Ate Sheboygan is a cleverly conceived, well-produced little game. It provides excellent opportunity for you to let your most monstrous fantasies run riot. Buy it, play it and enjoy it.\\" In the first issue of Ares Magazine, Eric Goldberg lauded The Creature that Ate Sheboygan, rating it a 9 out of 9 and saying, \\"Since Creature even appeals to non-gamers, no one should be without a copy.\\".

It functions as a mobile audio input station to project audio content a distance of one kilometre. Horn Massive is a monophonic sound projector designed and built by artist Matt Hope. Design and construction The core design of Horn Massive is that it is the largest horn which can be transported by a conventional truck. The design process took six months, most of that time spent calculating the steel cutting specifications needed for fabrication. Horn Massive was designed using the software tools AutoCAD, Bass Box Pro, Rhino 3D, 3D studio Max and Horn Calc. Horn Massive was built at Visual Arts fabrication machine shop at the University of California, San Diego. Fabrication time from cutting the first steel plate to final assembly was 14 months. The construction of Horn Massive required an extensive set of tools and machinery. The major part of the construction time was spent on fabrication, mig welding and machining all of the components. Horn Massive was built with help from the Scripps marine science development shop in La Jolla, California. The elements of Horn Massive, primarily made of mild steel, include the horn, frame, chassis/platform and lifting rig. All connecting components are made 6061 aluminum. Horn Massive cost approximately $8,000 in materials and components.  Publicity and events  Horn Massive has been discussed in RES magazine, Art net, Art forum, Re-up, and Xtra. It has been exhibited/played at the Supersonic 1 show in Los Angeles 2004, Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, Burning man and LA Freewaves festivals.

World War II On March 30, 1942, war ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy entered Shortland Harbor and landed two special naval landing force platoons and met no resistance. One platoon remained in the area to begin establishing Shortland Harbor Seaplane Base. The Allies considered invading the seaplane base in August 1943, but chose instead to bypass the Shortlands for Bougainville Island and the Treasury Islands, leaving the Shortlands under Japanese control until the war's end. On January 8, 1944, an Allied force of two light cruisers and five destroyers bombarded the installations on Shortland Island. In March 1944, planes from the USAAF's 70th Fighter Squadron used reconnaissance photographs taken by the 17th Reconnaissance Squadron to strike the seaplane base, claiming eight float planes and an IJN destroyer. On 20 May 1944, received light damage from return fire when she and two other light cruisers, along with eight destroyers, bombarded shore installations on Shortland.

Nominally a two-seater, it was purpose-built for FIA Group 4 racing in 1962‚Äì1963. Unlike its predecessors Lotus 15 and 17, the engine was mounted amidship behind the driver in the similar configuration developed on Lotus 19. The 23 To comply with FIA rules, it had a regulation trunk space to the right-rear of the driver, a windshield wiper, a horn, pairs of headlights and tail lights, rear center license plate light, a wire-operated emergency brake, and a mounting space for one spare tire under the front body. The 23 used a wider version of the Lotus 22Setright, L.J.K. \\"Lotus: The Golden Mean\\", in Northey, Tom, ed. The World of Automobiles (London: Orbis, 1974), Volume 11, p.1230. space frame, clothed in a fibreglass body. The front suspension was a typical double wishbone arms with outboard coil/damper unit using the Triumph upright made by Alford & Alder, Triumph Herald rack and pinion steering, and outboard Girling non-ventilated disc brake. The rear had the top link with lower reversed wishbone, top and bottom radius arms with the top arm at the height of the halfshaft, combined with the outboard disc brakes and coil/damper unit. Unlike the arrangement for Lotus 20 suspension, the halfshafts had Metalastic rubber 'doughnuts' on the inside, carrying no cornering (side) forces. The side forces are carried by the lower wishbone, together with the top 'I' arm link, which connects the tail end of the upper side tube in the frame with the extended top end of cast alloy upright. The tie-rod end, front top and bottom wishbone outside joints and the rear lower wishbone inside joint were Heim joints. The rest of the suspension joints were rubber joint, with joint-mounting pipes welded onto the ends of suspension arms. While most of the suspension arms were in common with Lotus 22, the angle of the rear radius arms on the plan view was different from the narrower-frame Lotus 22, so they were not interchangeable with the 22. It was originally intended for engines of 750 cc to 1300 cc (45-80ci) with a Renault 4-speed transaxle, but had a 5-speed Hewland Mk.III in production, which used the entire Volkswagen magnesium alloy transaxle case in upside-down configuration, housing bespoke straight-cut gears with dog-rings, and the Volkswagen differential gear set. Unlike the later Mk.IV, the Mk.III had the shifter rod at the end of the VW nose casing, so the shifting rod (pipe) from the centre shifter knob location extended to the tail end of the chassis. On the frame structure, the lower side pipes and the width-wise lower pipe behind the cockpit were rectangle tubes, with most of the other frame pipes being round steel tubes in various diameter. The upper left round pipe was used as the water (the use of anti-freeze chemicals was prohibited by most of the race organisers at the time for the danger of making the tarmac slippery) feed pipe for the radiator up front, and the lower right side pipe and a half of the width-wise lower rear cockpit pipe was the return tube. Likewise, the upper right side pipe was the oil feed to the oil cooler, and the lower left tube was the return. This frame was mostly made by Arch Motors, carrying 'AM' serial number. This configuration was shared with Lotus 22 and other Formula cars of the time, but the combination of a wider and thus larger radiator, wider (and somewhat bulkier) steel frame acting as a cooling device, and the small displacement engines resulted in more than ample cooling capacity. Atypical of the contemporary racing cars, Lotus 23 models sometimes experienced an over-cooling problem in sprint races, and displayed a very stable water temperature in endurance racing. Lotus 23B. The much thicker 3-point roll bar, as opposed to the original thin 2-point, and smoked wind screen are modern additions 23B cockpit. The two structural pipes (one just inside of the gear shifter) running length-wise connecting the front bulkhead to the rear section, are unique to 23B and 23C. These are the factory-standard rear view mirror locations The 23B The 23B in 1963 had the original center gear shifter relocated to the right side of the driver, and the radiator and oil cooler were combined into a single unit, with the lower 1/5 or so acting as the oil cooler. The frame received additional structural tubes to take the torque of Lotus TwinCam-based 1.6 litre Cosworth Mk.XII and Mk.XIII, mated to \\"high torque spec\\" 5-speed Hewland Mk.V transaxle. Smaller displacement engines were mated to 5-speed Hewland Mk.IV. Both the Mk.IV and Mk.V transaxles had GKN (Ford Zephyr) differential gears and a forward-facing selector rod on the right side in a bespoke (Hewland made) tail casing. The intake funnels on the Weber carburetors on 23B (and the 23C) were housed in a \\"cold air box\\" which received fresh air from two oval holes cut out on the top side of the rear body behind the driver. The 23C The 23B proved to be very successful in being a \\"giant killer\\" often beating cars in larger classes, but the limited road adhesion due to the narrow tyre width became apparent as the shortcoming in running with the larger cars. The 23C was developed using much wider Formula Two tyres mounted on wider 6-stud wobbly-web wheels front and rear. The body received wing-extensions to cover the wider tyres, with the characteristic 23/23B rear wings (covering the top half of the wheels on the outside) cut-out to expose the entire tyre/wheel in the side view. Lotus 23 proved a competitive, durable, and popular race car. These cars are still a mainstay of vintage racing in Europe and the United States today. Including the 23B and 23C, about 130 examples were made in period, but the popularity of the model led to many additional cars assembled from replacement and reproduction parts. The current estimate on the total number ranges between 200 and 400 excluding Xanthos and Noble. Debut at the N√ºrburgring The debut of the 23 was at the Nordschleife in May 1962. The tiny Lotus 23 with the newly developed 1.5 litre Lotus TwinCam engine shot away from the field of Porsches, Aston Martins and Ferraris with Jim Clark at the wheel in the rain. Even though some cars had four times the power of the Lotus, after the first lap in the wet, Clark was 27 seconds ahead of Dan Gurney's Porsche. Extending his lead on each lap until the track dried, Clark was overcome by exhaust fumes from a damaged exhaust manifold on lap 12 and crashed out. Banned from Le Mans With the sensational N√ºrburgring debut well publicised in the press, two 23s were entered at Le Mans in June 1962. One with a aluminium-block DOHC Coventry Climax FWMC with drivers Les Leston / Tony Shelly, and another with one litre Iron block pushrod Cosworth Mk.III with drivers Jim Clark / Trevor Taylor. The 23s failed to pass the scrutineering on several technical grounds, including an insufficient windscreen height, fuel tank capacity being too large, turning circle too large, ground clearance too small, and the spare tyre requirement not met.Setright, p.1230-1, says Chapman refused to have the 23 carry two different spare wheels, and after producing the four-bolt rear hubs, scrutineers proclaimed the cars dangerous. Fitted with a makeshift tall wind screen, all but the spare tyre issue was rectified almost immediately. The original 23 and the later 23B had 4 stud front and 6 stud rear wobbly-web wheels, and carried the narrower and lighter front wheel with its tyre mounted as the spare. (23C had wider 6 stud front and rear wheels.) The French scrutineers argued the requirement to carry a spare tyre is for the purpose of changing a flat, which is not satisfied by the 23 in the case of a flat occurring on one of the rear tyres. So the Lotus factory had a 4 stud rear hubs drafted and machined over-night, and had a person carry them and flown to Le Mans the next day. After being presented with the 23s with 4 stud rears installed, the scrutineers rejected again on the grounds that the 6 stud configuration must have been a reflection of strength requirement in the original design, so the 4 stud configuration was deemed unsafe. This is a rare of Les Leston Lotus 23 with tall windscreen and 4 stud rear hub. The scrutineers and the ACO did not change this position even after Mike Costin, the Lotus engineer on site, offered to go over structural analysis calculations showing the difference falls within the safety margin built in the design to accommodate more powerful Cosworth Mk.IV and Cosworth Mk.VII engines. One of the two Lotus 23s with 4 stud rears, with Cosworth Mk.III engine, was sold off sans engine on the spot to the 1 litre class winning driver of the event, with a lease on the engine and support contract attached, on a strict condition imposed by Chapman to keep the 4 stud configuration for longer than one racing season. The French driver/buyer, Bernard Consten, not only obliged but won Clermont-Ferrand 6 Hours and 1000 km of Montlhery that year with this 23 without breaking the studs, the hub, or the wheel. Team Lotus remained on the scene for the entire 1962 event supporting and winning the 1.3 litre GT class and the Index of Performance prize by a Lotus Elite driven by David Hobbs and Frank Gardner. ACO officials then made the situation worse in admitting a mistake, offering a financial compensation for the 23 entries after the race. With pro-Lotus motoring journalist G√©rard Crombac (who reported the entire fiasco in a French publication, suggesting the Ferrari 246SP and 268SP had the same ground clearance issue, but were allowed to race unrectified after the Ferrari team threatened to withdraw the entire team) present as the interpreter in the meeting, Chapman suggested a figure which was too large for the officials to swallow. Upon being rejected, Chapman vowed \\"We will never race again at Le Mans!\\", a promise that Lotus kept until 1997, long after Chapman's death in 1982. Chapman believed the fiasco was caused by the French contender for Index of Thermal Efficiency award, Ren√© Bonnet. G√©rard Crombac knew of a competitor to Bonnet, Jean R√©d√©l√©'s ambition to beat the then-dominant Automobiles Ren√© Bonnet in thermal efficiency at Le Mans, and gave the idea of helping Alpine instead of subsequent direct participation to Chapman. As a result, a 2-seater racing prototype was designed by a team of Lotus employees, Len Terry, Bob Dance and Keith Duckworth, based on Lotus 23. This design was found to be non-compliant to the 1963 Le Mans regulations, so the frame structure was changed to a steel backbone design familiar to R√©d√©l√©'s team at Alpine, and became the Alpine M63. M64 of 1964 had the original frame designed by Terry, and the French Alpine M63 and M64 could fit British 6-stud Wobbly Web wheels as a testament. In 1964 Le Mans, Alpine won the Index of Thermal Efficiency with the M64 while setting a new distance record for the 1150cc Prototype class, with a M63B in the second place. Alpine went on to become the Le Mans overall winner in 1978. Restoration and replication of the Lotus 23 Beginning in the early 1980s a small group of enthusiasts began to make it possible to restore original Lotus 23 by remanufacturing parts. These parts are now easily available. It was at about this time that a Register was established for the Lotus 23. That Register is now part of the Historic Lotus Register of the UK. Some race organizers and the Historic Motor Sports Association began in 2007 to take steps to restrict race participation by replica cars. There are several sources of replicas of Lotus 23 cars. Xanthos 23 The Xanthos 23 (1999) is an exact reproduction of the 23B using the same frame design as the 1960s original. Powered by Lotus-Ford Twin Cam or its Cosworth derivatives mostly mated to Hewland Mk.8 or Mk.9, it was built by Xanthos Sports Cars in Liverpool, a UK company owned by Lotus specialist Kelvin Jones. The company now seems to be Xanthos Cars North America, Inc. Noble 23 Following the success of his Ultima GTR project, Lee Noble created a Lotus 23 replica in 1996 with a wider track than the original to allow for the use of wider tyres. With a lower level of adherence to the original design than the Xanthos, it proved successful in racing, with over 60 cars produced using either Lotus TwinCam or Renault V6 engines. Noble's version continued in production, first by Auriga Design using an Alfa Romeo engine and transaxle, and now as the C23 Lotus 23 replica by Mamba Motorsport near Oxford, UK using Ford Duratec Engines. LusoMotors LM23 The Portuguese LusoMotors kit-car company with Jo√£o Matoso dynamics engineering support built a reinterpretation of the Lotus 23 (called LM23) which was shown at NEC 2009. Tiger Racing ERA30 The UK Based Tiger Racing ERA 30 takes its design inspiration from the Lotus 23 although the car has been designed to be slightly larger with wider tyres and bigger brakes.

A =Scarlett Anderson Scarlett Anderson was played by Cat Simmons during 2005. Scarlett's storyline sees her seduce married man Les Boulter (Howard Saddler). But he tells her it was a mistake. Caleb Andrews Caleb Andrews was played by Steve Tosssaint during 2004 and appeared as a series regular. He is the best friend of Les Boulter (Howard Saddler) and love interest of Les' wife Denise Boulter (Clare Perkins). One notable storyline for the character involved him taking a HIV test, the results of which were negative. It is revealed that he Brendan Boulter's (Steven Burrell) biological father. Caleb tries to reignite his affair with Denise, but in the end Denise chooses Les. Caleb shares a kiss with Eileen Callan (Rosie Rowell), whose husband Pete Callan (David Easter) was held on remand for murder. Caleb leaves Charnham because Eileen's daughter, Lucy Day (Julia Lee Smith) witnesses the kiss and threatens to tell Pete. Gavin Arnold Gavin Arnold was played by Neil Roberts and made his first appearance in 2001. Roberts was a newcomer to the soap opera genre and was signed to the show's regular cast. A columnist from the Daily Record included Gavin's return to Charnham in their \\"pick of the day\\" feature. Polly Arnold Polly Arnold was played by Juliet Cowan during 2001. Tanya Ayuba Tanya Ayuba was played by Laila Rouass between 2000 and 2001 and was a doctor. The character appeared on a recurring basis and it was Rouass' first role on British television. Ten years after her departure from the show, Rouass claimed she was still recognised as Tanya. A Soaplife reporter revealed that Tanya would be stunned when her boyfriend Gavin Arnold (Neil Roberts) asks her to move in. They added that Tanya feels that their relationship is moving too fast and curious about his relationship with his estranged wife Imogen. Tanya finds Imogen's address and goes to see her in what transpires to be a \\"disastrous visit\\". B=Cheryl Barker DC Cheryl Barker was played by Cathy Murphy between 2003 and 2004. She engaged in a live-in relationship with Dave Matthews, which sometimes caused tensions given his propensity to sometimes operate outside the law. Madge Bennet Madge Bennet played by Heather Chasen appeared for 5 episodes in 2005. Brendan Boulter Brendan Boulter was played by Steven Burrell between 2003 and 2004. Denise Boulter Denise, along with her husband Les and children Brendan and Kelly moved into Stanley Street in December 2003 shortly after the death of Roy Farmer in the cybercafe fire. Denise and her husband purchased the corner caf√© and number 16 Stanley Street from Roy's widow Nikki Warrington. They started a restaurant on the site of the caf√© and the family moved into number 16. Les's old friend Caleb Andrews (Steve Toussaint) was employed to work in the restaurant as a cook. Denise initially tried to keep secret the truth about a long-ago affair with Caleb, and the fact that Brendan was actually Caleb's son. Denise and Caleb resumed their affair, but quickly ended it when Denise realised she loved Les, however Les found out about it soon after. During her time on Stanley Street, Denise built up strong friendships with Cat MacKenzie, Chrissy Costello, Eileen Callan and Cheryl Barker. The five of them formed a pub darts team. While walking home one night in December 2004, Denise was raped by an unidentified assailant. Les immediately suspected Christian Habgood, Denise's tutor at Charnham College. However, when entering the car of local taxi driver Graham Harker (Lee Warburton) Denise suspected him of the crime based only on her recollections of the smell of his aftershave and his usage of the phrase \\"Scout's honour\\". The police questioned Harker, but no forensic evidence could be found to link him to the crime and they were forced to release him due to lack of evidence. Denise persisted with her desire to see him arrested, and eventually learned the true identity of her attacker. Shortly after this Denise discovered that Les had been to see prostitutes on a number of occasions. Marriage counselling was unsuccessful, the couple split and in late 2005 Denise moved away. Her daughter Kelly and granddaughter Susie later joined her. Denise was portrayed by Claire Perkins. Kelly Boulter Kelly Boulter, played by Carryl Thomas, made her first appearance in October 2003 and departed in August 2005. Kelly first appeared in Charnham in October 2003, around the time she was dating Benji McHugh. Kelly had also been sleeping with Justin MacKenzie. When Kelly fell pregnant with twins, there was some doubt over the paternity of the babies. Eventually, Justin was revealed to be the father. Despite Benji's warnings to take things easy, Kelly began drinking and as a result collapsed and was hospitalized. In hospital, doctors revealed Kelly had lost one of the twins. Benji left Charnham for sunnier climes after this. Kelly's family, particular her father Les and brother Brendan didn't really care for Justin, as they liked Benji. However, Denise, Kelly's mother was prepared to give Justin the benefit of the doubt. After the Boulters had settled into the area and purchased the corner cafe previously owned by Roy Farmer until his death in a fire at the same premises in November 2003, Kelly had made some friends in local teenage girls Lucy Day and Melanie Costello. In July 2004, Kelly gave birth to a baby girl, Susie, named after Justin's mother. Justin and Kelly later became engaged.Throughout the rest of the year, Kelly was involved in several family dramas including the break-up of Brendan's marriage to Melanie following a revelation that Brendan was bisexual; and Denise's rape. In early 2005, Kelly and Justin were horrified when they were accused of abusing Susie, after she had suffered severe head injuries. The Boulters and MacKenzies were under surveillance from social workers for several months until a judge at a hearing was satisfied that nobody was at fault but ordered a review every three months. In August 2005, after Denise had left Les, Kelly wasn't too far behind as her relationship with Justin fell apart after he'd slept with a friend of hers from College; Scarlet Anderson. It turned out Scarlet had also slept with Les. Following this, Kelly left Charnham, taking Susie with her and later joined Denise. Les Boulter Lester \\"Les\\" Boulter, played by Howard Saddler, made his first appearance in November 2003. He departed in August 2005. Les first appeared in Charnham in November 2003, shortly after he and his wife Denise, had heard the news that their daughter Kelly was pregnant. Just before Christmas, Les and Denise moved into the area and began running their own Cafe on the site of the previous Cybercafe that had been destroyed in a fire, resulting in the death of the owner, Roy Farmer. Les took a dislike to Kelly's boyfriend, Justin MacKenzie but eventually warmed to him. During the first few months of 2004, Denise had been having an affair with old friend, Caleb Andrews. Les found out but eventually forgave Denise. Further shocks were to come when Les discovered Brendan wasn't his son, but Brendan reassured Les that he considered him his dad. Things went from bad to worse between Les and Denise. Les became jealous of Denise spending so much time with her tutor at Charnahm College, Christian Habgood. One night in December, Denise was raped while walking through an alleyway. When cab driver Graham Harker moved into Stanley Street, Denise immediately recognised his voice. After months of high drama and Graham's arrest for kidnapping Denise and holding her daughter-in-law Melanie against her will in his flat, Les and Denise tried to get things back to normal but the damage had been done. Les began seeing prostitutes on two occasions, despite hesitating. Les was arrested on the spot one day and fined. Following this, Les and Denise separated. Les sold the corner cafe to Marc MacKenzie and moved up to Liverpool, leaving Justin in charge of letting his house. Conor Byrne Conor Byrne was Declan's brother, resident in Charnham for several months in 2000. Conor was played by Glenn Mulhern. Declan Byrne Declan Byrne was played by Quentin Jones between 1999 and 2001. C=Eileen Callan Eileen Callan (n√©e Day) was played by Rosie Rowell from 2002 until final episode in 2005. Pete Callan Peter 'Pete' Callan was played by David Easter from 1997 to 2005. Pete becomes close to Julie-Ann Jones (Chloe Howman) and nearly sleeps with her. Julie-Ann's mother realised what could happen and informed Pete that he is Julie-Ann's father. Easter told Sue Malins from Soaplife that \\"Pete always regrets that Julie-Ann came into his life a fully grown woman and that he missed out on her childhood years.\\" Missing out on Julie-Ann growing up makes him realise that he cannot let the same occur with David Junior. Pete is annoyed when Cat Matthews (Nicola Duffett) puts Dave Matthews (Richard Hawley) as David Jnr's father on his birth certificate. Pete decides he will be more successful in a custody battle if he too were married. He sets his sights on family friend Siobhan Jones (Jemma Walker). Easter explained that \\"he realises that her has to find a partner so he can present himself as part of a stable relationship equipped to raise a child.\\" Easter believed that Pete targets Siobhan despite being aware that she is vulnerable. But she had always called him \\"Uncle Pete\\" and viewed him as a friend. As the storyline progresses he proposes to her. Easter added that \\"despite being completely calculating in the beginning\\"; Pete proposes marriage out of genuine love. A reporter from Soaplife observed that \\"nearly every woman who walks into this soap seems to walk into his arms ‚Äì and is soon made to regret it.\\" Pete begins a relationship with Charlotte Day (Leanne Lakey). She later proposes marriage to him despite allegations that he has slept with his ex- wife Claire Toomey (Tina Hall). Following advice from Siobhan that Charlotte may be his final chance of happiness, that Pete decides to accept. But a new affair storyline is developed and Charlotte sleeps with Johnny multiple times. Pete learns of their affair and decides to set a trap. A Soaplife writer said \\"Charlotte and Pete's relationship is proving more elastic than a pair of Cat's leopard-skin leggings. But, unlike the aforementioned garment, it seems to be holding up very well, despite much outside interference.\\" Beth Hart from Digital Spy believed that Pete had met his match in Charlotte because she kept him \\"on his toes\\" since they met. Hart later branded him \\"Charnham's arch manipulator\\". Soaplife's Di Hollingsworth said \\"Pete Callan's a cunning, devious charmer who manages to smile that evil smile of his even when he's delivering the nastiest threat imaginable. Women don't seem able to resist falling at his feet.\\" The writer later opined that \\"Pete's a guy totally without morals. Combine that with oodles of sex appeal and you've got a deadly cocktail, one that Pete serves up when he needs to get his own way. He can turn on the charmm like a tap, and he frequently does.\\" Fellow columnist Emma Pomfret observed \\"Pete Callan's love life is about as savoury as one of Fred Elliott's best tripe pies.\\" Pete entered the storyline in June 1997. As Maria's callous former husband he was disliked by most of her friends, the Hart and Gates families and their associates. Nevertheless, he took over running local bar restaurant The Lock where they all regularly hung out. Pete developed a deep seated enmity with Roy Farmer, and later developed similar rivalries with his employee Josh Matthews and Josh's father Dave. Despite his thuggish tendencies Pete was revealed to have a love of children. During a brief and troubled marriage to Claire Toomey was nevertheless a devoted stepfather to her twins Evan and Stella. After splitting from Claire, Pete embarked upon a De facto marriage to Dave' ex-wife Cat for several months, but it was eventually revealed to have been a con perpetrated by Pete to exact revenge on Dave and to swindle Cat out of her home. He had convinced her to sign over ownership of her home to him as a formality to expedite a business transaction. After this was done he revealing the con to her, ended the relationship, and kept the house. Soon after this Cat found she was pregnant. At first there was doubt as to whether the child was Pete's or Dave's. Tests showed the child to be Pete's. After selling The Lock and buying pub The Black Swan, Pete reemployed Josh as a barman to pay off a debt. Pete later murdered Josh, framing his then-wife Siobhan for the crime. She was found guilty and given a suspended sentence. Soon after the trial she realised that Pete had framed her. Pete was imprisoned (on remand) for a lengthy period starting December 2003 after being framed for arson by his then-wife Eileen. He returned after being acquitted at his trial in June 2004. He continued in Charnham until September 2005 when he was shot dead during an armed standoff with S019 officers. Pete was a very iconic Family Affairs character. He was born on 9 July 1959 in Liverpool or London but was living in Stepney, London by the time he was 11. His real father's first name is unknown but his Scouse mother Joan, who we saw in the series, remarried when Pete was 11 and Pete suffered years of abuse at the hands of his stepfather. His mum knew but never did anything. Pete was charged for his stepfather's manslaughter in 1975 and sentenced to 3 years in prison. He had an affair the very early 1980s with Patsy Jones, the wife of his mate Reg and Patsy gave birth to Julie Ann in 1981 but Pete never knew Julie Ann was his until 18 years later. He married Maria in the 1980s and made his debut in Charnham in 1997. David Cash David Cash was played by James Gaddas. The character is a solicitor and boss and partner to Holly Hart (Sandra Huggett). Chloe Costello Chloe Costello was played by Leah Coombes from September 2003 until the end of the series in 2005. Chrissy Costello Christine (Chrissy) Costello (n√©e Maxwell) was played by Kazia Pelka from 2003 until the end of the series in 2005. Gary Costello Gary Costello was played by Gary Webster from 2003 until the end of the series in 2005. Melanie Costello Melanie Costello (formerly Boulter) was played by Rebecca Hunter from September 2003 until May 2005. She returned for the final week of the series in December 2005. Myra Costello Myra Costello was played by Kate Williams from 2003 until the end of the series in 2005. Gemma Craig Gemma Craig was played by Angela Hazeldine from 1999 until the character's departure in 2003. Gemma forms a friendship with local bad boy Arlo Dean (Asier Cebeira). But their friendship is threatened by the behaviour of her Aunt Joyce. Cebeira told Soaplife reporter Emma Pomfret that Gemma brings out Arlo's affectionate side. He added that Arlo \\"really cares about Gemma and he didn't give a damn about what he had to do to escape Joyce.\\" Gemma begins a relationship with Paul Webb (Martin Delaney).

Luisa WarringtonLuke Warrington Luke Warrington was played by Royce Cronin from January 2000 until March 2001, and from December 2001 to May 2002. Nikki Warrington Nikki Warrington was played by Rebecca Blake from January 2000 until December 2003. The wardrobe department kitted Nikki out with a plain dress code. Blake told Susan Riley of Soaplife that \\"Nikki's clothes are slowly getting trendier but she's very dowdy. When I used to see how frumpy I looked on-screen, I'd hotfoot it down to wardrobe and try to lose a few of her outfits.\\" When Blake first joined the show she was styling a shorter hair cut. But while filming her hair would drop over her face and Blake believed it made Nikki look like a muppet. Nikki arrives in Charnham with her children Becky Scott (Chandra Reugg) and Darren Scott (Joe Fox). She is accompanied by her husband Andrew Warrington (Simon Cook) and his grown up children Sara Warrington (Beth Cordingly) and Luke Warrington (Royce Cronin). Though an attraction develops with the latter and they begin an affair. Blake defended her character's actions by noting that Nikki only ever acted on her feelings for Luke following alcohol consumption. Nikki's ex-husband Adrian Scott (Ariyon Bakare) is introduced into the show and he learns of their affair. Blake told Diana Hollingsworth from Soaplife that \\"Nikki can't bear for the children to find out that she slept with Luke. She doesn't want to decimate the family set-up she's worked so hard to create. And Andrew is very much part of that package.\\" Adrian uses his knowledge of the affair into forcing her to let him take Becky and Darren away. But Blake explained that Nikki believes that Adrian will not be able to support them and will return them home. She then blames their departure on Andrew's family problems. But the deceit and her children's absence proves too much for the character. Blake stated \\"She's blown to pieces, utterly destroyed [...] Nikki is distraught. She keeps breaking down and is finding it very hard to hold everything together.\\" Becky is miserable living with Adrian and runs away to visit Luke at university. Nikki goes to collect her but ends up sleeping with Luke despite the trouble their affair already created. This was because the duo have a \\"strong sexual chemistry\\". Blake also believed that Nikki had fallen in love with Luke. But she remains determined to stay with Andrew. Blake reasoned that \\"It would blow the family apart completely. He's a very straight guy ‚Äì I don't think he could envisage a bigger betrayal. It couldn't be worse.\\" Andrew begins to suspect an affair when he returns from an American lecture tour. He is suspicious of Adrian taking the children and demands answers. Nikki lies to Andrew claiming she has been unfaithful with a colleague. Andrew is angry with Nikki but also willing to save their marriage. Cook told Alison James of Soaplife that \\"he still loves Nikki and wants to make a go of things. But he doesn't make it easy for her. there's no way he intends to just forgive and forget.\\" However Sara realises that Nikki will continue sleeping with Luke and makes sure Andrew catches them having sex. Cook believed that it was the ultimate betrayal from his wife and son. The shock leaves him numb and devastated. Andrew blames Nikki and believes that she corrupted her own son for an affair. Cook added that Nikki \\"completely abandoned her responsibilities\\". Cook thought that Nikki's reasons for wanting to remain with Andrew were selfish. He added \\"Nikki's desperate to save it, probably because she'll lose everything ‚Äì a sizeable income and her kids.\\" Cook said there was no hope of Nikki and Andrew repairing their relationship. Producers decided to write Andrew out of the show. They realised that Andrew could not live on the same street as Nikki. Hollingsworth branded Nikki \\"Charnham's wicked stepmum\\" for sleeping with Luke. While she later added \\"Nikki Warrington gave the term 'wicked stepmother' a whole new meaning when she fell into the arm's of her husband Andrew's son.\\" Their colleague Alison Riley said that Nikki's life was a \\"right mess\\".

The actress believed that Paul's disagreements with Gemma in the lead up to their wedding did not bode well for their future. Hazeldine felt sorry for Paul because he had turned his life around and changed his attitude and tried to do right by Gemma. But she believed the proposal resulted in problems that otherwise would not have occurred. The thought of marriage proves difficult and [Hazeldine added] \\"it's a disaster ‚Äì but Gemma has never been completely sure about marrying Paul.\\" The character had gained the sympathy of viewers and Hazeldine was approached in public warning her character to keep away from Cameron and honour her relationship with Paul.

Geography Rendova Island is a roughly rectangularly-shaped island, located in the South Pacific in the New Georgia Islands. The length of the island is about 40 kilometers. To the north is the island of New Georgia and to the east is the island of Vangunu. Rendova is a volcanic island, with a central stratovolcano cone, with a height of which last erupted in the Pleistocene; however, the island is subject to frequent earthquakes. The island is surrounded in some places by a coral reef. The climate on Rendova is wet and tropical, and the island is subject to frequent cyclones. Flora and fauna The black-sand beaches along the southwest coast of Rendova are important nesting grounds for the critically endangered leatherback turtle. Community-based conservation organisation, the Tetepare Descendants' Association, runs a leatherback conservation program in the villages of Baniata, Havilla and Retavo on this coastline. Population In 1999, the population of Rendova was estimated at 3,679 people.

History American landing at Rendova Island On March 15, 1893, Rendova was declared part of the British Solomon Islands protectorate. The island was occupied by the Empire of Japan in the early stages of World War II. On June 30, 1943, Allied forces carried out the landings on Rendova which quickly overcame the 300-man Japanese garrison as part of a strategy to ultimately recapture Munda and its airfield on the island of New Georgia. The island was subsequently used as a base by the United States Navy for PT boat operations.

The spice rub forms a coating on the food. The food can be marinated in the spice rub for some time for the flavors to incorporate into the food or it can be cooked immediately after it is coated in the rub. The spice rub can be left on or partially removed before cooking. Ingredients The spices are usually coarsely ground. In addition to spices, salt and sugar may be added to the rub, the salt for flavor and the sugar for caramelization. Different salts are sometimes used for their unique qualities, such as Himalayan pink salt. The simplest rub is just coarsely ground black pepper as in steak au poivre. Spice rubs can also have ingredients such as herbs, crushed garlic or oil added to make a paste. Less common ingredients can include coffee beans. Foods Spice rubs are mainly used for preparing meats and fish. There are many different recipes for rubs and most of them are targeted towards a specific kind of food. The exact combination of spices that makes a good rub for a particular kind of food varies from region to region and culture to culture. Cooking methods Cooking with rubs is almost always done using the dry heat method of cooking where almost no water based liquid is used in cooking. The most popular cooking method for food prepared using a spice rub is grilling. Baking and pan roasting are other dry-heat methods. Saut√©ing is another method, especially if the spice rub includes flour or bread crumbs. When water is used for cooking, it is usually after the food has already been partially cooked with the dry heat method.

She has sung on several complete opera recordings with Chandos Records, including the title roles in Dvo≈ô√°k's Rusalka, Jan√°ƒçek's K√°≈•a Kabanov√° and Puccini's Madama Butterfly, and Emilia Marty in Jan√°ƒçek's The Makropulos Case. She has also made two solo recordings of opera arias, one with the London Philharmonic Orchestra under conductor David Parry and the other with Orchestra Victoria and conductor Richard Bonynge. On the stage she has had partnerships with the English National Opera (ENO) and Opera Australia. Career Barker studied with Dame Joan Hammond at the Victorian College of the Arts and began her career as a member of the opera chorus at the Victoria State Opera at the age of 19. She made her first solo appearance at that house as Blondchen in Mozart's Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail at the age of 23. In 1984, Barker moved with her husband, baritone Peter Coleman- Wright, to London, so that he could assume his new position as a member of the choir at the Glyndebourne Festival. Two weeks after their arrival, Barker auditioned for and was accepted as a member of the opera chorus at the Welsh National Opera. She stayed there for the next year and a half, occasionally substituting for ailing singers in larger parts and performing the occasional comprimario role in addition to singing in the chorus. In 1986, Barker was awarded the Dame Mabel Brookes Fellowship and was a finalist in the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions. These accolades helped her to launch a solo career with minor opera companies during the late 1980s. She performed the roles of Marzelline in Fidelio and Cherubino in The Marriage of Figaro with the English Touring Opera. In 1989 she won the Royal Over-Seas League Competition in London. Her first major critical success came in 1990 at her debut at the Sydney Opera House as Mim√¨ in Puccini's La boh√®me, directed by Baz Luhrmann. Since the early 1990s Barker has been a regular performer with all of the major opera companies in Australia. With the State Opera of South Australia she has sung Blondchen and Mim√¨. At the Victoria State Opera she has appeared as Antonia in The Tales of Hoffmann, the First Lady in The Magic Flute, and Mim√¨. She has portrayed Tatyana in Eugene Onegin at the Lyric Opera of Queensland and Cio-Cio San in Madama Butterfly with Auckland Opera. With Opera Australia she has performed Countess Almaviva in The Marriage of Figaro, Cio-Cio San, Desdemona in Otello, Emilia Marty in The Makropulos Affair, Lauretta in Gianni Schicchi, Marie/Mariette in the Australian premiere, directed by Bruce Beresford, of Die tote Stadt, the Marschallin in Der Rosenkavalier, Marzelline in Fidelio, Nedda in Pagliacci, and the title roles in Arabella, Manon Lescaut, Salome and Suor Angelica.

G. Ballard. It was first published in the October 1960 edition of New Worlds (Volume 99, Number 33),http://www.rickmcgrath.com/jgballard/jgb60_61.html and later in the 1962 collection The Voices of Time and Other Stories.http://www.rickmcgrath.com/jgballard/jgb62_63.html It is an early example of the Inner Space type of story which drove the New Wave movement in the 1960s. Its primary theme is one which was common in the New Wave, that of entropy and the breakdown of all things. Plot summary The story has little or no obvious plot. It follows a neurosurgeon, Powers, who is in a state of mental and physical decline. He works at a research clinic in a landscape of hills and dry salt lake beds somewhat like that of the deserts of California. Powers has resigned, as he finds his hours of wakefulness getting shorter and shorter. He seems about to become yet another Sleeper, one of an ever- increasing number of people who lapse into a coma from which they cannot be roused. Many Sleepers are housed at the clinic. Powers records his feelings, and his last interviews with his therapist, in a journal in which he also records strange epigrams, such as \\"Goodbye, Eniwetok\\" ‚Äì an allusion suggesting that increased levels of background radiation from nuclear weapons testing may somehow be responsible for mankind's predicament. Along with excerpts from recordings of interviews, such entries drive the story forward and provide a counterpoint to the standard third-person narrative. Powers had a colleague, a biologist called Whitby, who committed suicide, but not before carving an elaborate mandala into the bottom of an empty swimming pool. As we find from Powers' replaying of recordings of interviews, Whitby was convinced that life itself was in decline, that evolution had peaked. Life, and particularly humans, would become simpler as time went by: > Five thousand centuries from now, our descendants, instead of being multi- > brained star-men, will probably be naked prognathous idiots ... grunting > their way through the remains of this Clinic ... Whitby's own research involved using highly tuned X-rays to selectively activate the so-called \\"silent pair\\" of genes in animals and plants. The results are bizarre creatures that can directly \\"sense\\" time and pace their metabolism to the geological age of their surroundings, can \\"see\\" in gamma radiation wavelengths, and exhibit grotesque changes like an external nervous system that can expand limitlessly in a web-like manner. Powers himself keeps finding wild animals outside Whitby's lab with similar strange mutations, such as a frog with a lead-lined shell on it. Powers is stalked, and somewhat tormented, by Kaldren, a patient who has been surgically altered by Powers so that he does not sleep. Kaldren scrawls huge numbers in places where Powers will see them, apparently representing some kind of countdown. Kaldren's latest girlfriend, an unearthly beauty he calls, ironically, Coma, approaches Powers on Kaldren's behalf. We learn much of what is going on through Powers' explanations to her. Powers explains that the \\"silent pair\\" phenomenon is closely linked to the Sleepers, so by implication he also has the genes. By activating them, Whitby seemed to show that the pair are a last-ditch attempt to jump-start evolution and preserve life on Earth in an environment abnormally high in nuclear radiation. Powers consents to visit Kaldren in his home, a bizarre spiral structure which is supposed to represent the square root of ‚àí1. Kaldren shows him his collection of \\"Terminal Documents\\"--his obituary of the human race. They include ephemera such as an EEG recording of Albert Einstein and the results of psychological tests of the twelve condemned to death at the Nuremberg trials. The numbers which so obsess Kaldren are received as radio transmissions from other galaxies. It has been estimated that when the countdown reaches zero, the Universe will have just ended. Kaldren grabs Powers by the arm and warns him: > You're not alone, Powers, don't think you are. These are the voices of time, > and they're all saying goodbye to you ... every particle in your body, every > grain of sand, every galaxy carries the same signature ... you know what the > time is now, so what does the rest matter? Powers has for some time been recreating Whitby's mandala on a grand scale, using concrete on an old artillery range. Having performed some procedure on himself, he goes to it one last time, lost in a wash of sound only he can hear, coming from the rocks, the ancient hills, and the very stars themselves. At the center of the structure, turning toward the great galaxies that broadcast Kaldren's countdowns, he feels a stream of time coming to bear him away, and gives himself up to it. His body is found by Coma. Whitby's lab is in chaos as the life-forms have mutated and run riot. Powers had applied the tuned X-rays to himself, activating his own 'silent genes'. Kaldren pockets a film he finds by the X-ray generator. He secludes himself in his house. Background to story One of the background stories involves the experiences of a group of astronauts who landed on the moon. They sent back messages describing meetings with beings from Orion who revealed the truth about the Universe to them, and were never heard from again. The name used for the astronauts is the \\"Mercury Seven\\". The actual astronauts for Project Mercury were announced in 1959, the year before this story was published.

Born in Old Barns, Nova Scotia, he was elected to the House of Commons of Canada for the Nova Scotia riding of Shelburne and Queen's in the 1911 election as a Conservative. He was re-elected in the 1917 election for the riding of Colchester as a supporter of Sir Robert Laird Borden's Unionist government. In 1916, he was one of the first parliamentarians to be appointed a Parliamentary Secretary, when he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary of Militia and Defence for Sam Hughes. He was also the Parliamentary Secretary of Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment. Upon his appointment to Borden's Cabinet in 1920 as Minister of Public Works he was required by the law of the time to resign his seat and run in a by-election. By this point it was customary for Cabinet ministers running in by-elections to be acclaimed however, the newly formed United Farmers party contested the by-election with a United-Farmers/Labour candidate. McCurdy opted to face this challenge by running as a Nationalist Liberal rather than as a Conservative and was re- elected, though narrowly. It is possible he chose this banner as the Unionist Party had formally changed its name to the National Liberal and Conservative Party by this time or as a means of facing down the threat from a left-wing candidate. In any case, Blanchard ran the following year in the 1921 election as a Conservative and was defeated.

Each kebele consists of at least five hundred families, or the equivalent of 3,500 to 4,000 persons. There is at least one in every town with more than 2,000 population. A keftanya, or representative, had jurisdiction over six to twelve kebeles. The kebele, also referred to as a peasant association, was created by the Derg in 1975 to promote development and to manage land reform; they became a key element that the rival Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Party and MEISON fought each other, and the ruling Derg, to control during the Ethiopian Red Terror.

It is officially accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). History of the town of Franklin In 1856, the town of Franklin was founded by an enterprising gentleman named Andrew George, who established the town fourteen miles south of Sacramento on Lower Stockton Road. Now known as Franklin Boulevard, this had been the main road from Sutter's Fort to the Mexican capital of Monterey. During the Gold Rush, this road became the stage route to Stockton. George did not originally name the town Franklin, as it is known today. He called it \\"Georgetown\\", after himself, and the post office there was known by that name. The hotel he built was, however, given the name \\"Franklin House\\" in honor of his mother's family, the Franklins. History of Franklin schools Since the district's creation in 1959, Franklin Elementary School had been the only school located in the town of Franklin. Franklin High School was opened in 2002 in the new East Franklin area. Franklin High School has graduated students every year since the class of 2005. Campus Franklin High School shares its campus with Toby Johnson Middle School and the Franklin Community Library. As well as their academic program, Franklin High School offers the STEAM academy, the GREEN academy, AVID, the athletic department, and Visual and Performing Arts (VAPA) department. Academic competitions In 2009 and 2010, Franklin won both individual and team awards including Moot Court, Academic Decathlon, Science Olympiad, National History Day, and Mathletes.

Two residents of the same neighborhood may describe different neighborhood boundaries, which could be based on ZIP codes, ethnic groupings, or simply personal opinion. Although rooted in history, neighborhoods remain social constructions, in which seemingly concrete things like boundaries are in flux, according to the observer and time period. This encyclopedic problem is true for all cities but is particularly complicated in Milwaukee when identified neighborhoods can be within other neighborhoods. For instance, Brady Street and East Village are inside the East Side, but Beerline B is essentially located in Riverwest. At the same time some Riverwest residents may regard the Beerline B as a separate distinct neighborhood or perhaps part of adjacent Brewers' Hill. On the other hand, Beerline B and Brewers' Hill residents might or might not agree that Beerline B is part of Brewers' Hill. Certainly, residents and realtors tend to assign new names as neighborhoods evolve. In other cases, some historic identities are revived by community or political groups, as for instance with Bronzeville. In 1990, the Neighborhood Identification Project set boundaries and names for 75 areas of the city. Prior to that, neighborhood names were not official and many areas had no names, official or otherwise. Milwaukee's North Side=Arlington Heights Arlington Heights is a neighborhood on Milwaukee's north side. It is bordered by Capitol Drive to the north, I-43 to the east, Keefe Avenue to the south and 20th Street to the west. It is home to Lindbergh Park, an elementary school, a middle school, and a Lutheran grade school. Union Cemetery is located at the far southwest corner of the neighborhood.

The neighborhood is bordered by North Avenue to the north, the Milwaukee River and Holton Avenue to the east, Pleasant Street to the south, and Dr Martin Luther King Jr Drive to the west.JS Online: Revitalization keeps brewing on the hill The name Brewers' Hill (formerly \\"Uihlein Hill\\") is derived from the large number of brewery workers and owners who once inhabited the area. Just to the south of the neighborhood, the Schlitz and Blatz breweries once operated. It is a mixed neighborhood where a laborer's cottage could stand across the street from a manager's stylish house. Brewers' Hill contains an architectural mix of Greek Revival, Italianate, Queen Anne (including Stick-style), and Colonial Revival buildings dating from the 1850s to the 1920s.Brief History of Brewers' Hill: A New Look At An Old Community.- brewershill.org The neighborhood has undergone gentrification, with former factories converted into businesses and condominiums. Part of the neighborhood, the Brewers' Hill Historic District, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, comprising 130 structures built from 1855 to 1929, including: * The Fitch house at 1825 N. 2nd St. is a rather simple 2-story brick cube with Italianate styling built in 1859. This was the home of Baron Von Cotzhausen, a descendant of Prussian nobility who lived there from 1863 to 1868, practicing law in Milwaukee. With * The house at 102 W. Vine St. is a 2-story frame house in Italianate style with a Gothic Revival emphasis on the vertical, built in 1873. * The Miller Brewery Bar at 301 E. Garfield Ave is a 2-story structure with decorative brickwork on two sides, built in 1880. * The James Knox house at 1843-1845 N. Palmer Street is a two- story brick and stone Queen Anne-styled house with a Gothic Revival-styled gable window. It was designed by Charles Gombert and built in 1881 for tanner Charles Scheiderer. * The Oldenburg house at 303-305 E. Lloyd St is a 2.5-story house with a 3-story tower and Eastlake ornamentation, built in 1882. It is the only Italian villa-style house in the Brewers' Hill district. * The Lubotsky residence at 1830 N 1st Street is a 2-story Queen Anne-styled house with a Stick style facade, built in 1890. * 131-133 E. Lloyd St. is a 2.5-story frame Queen Anne-styled home built in 1901, with the shingles in the gable end which are typical of the style. It is one of many Queen Anne homes in the district. In 2009, This Old House named Brewers' Hill as one of its \\"Best Old House Neighborhoods,\\" where the neighborhood was referred to as \\"a distinctly Victorian-era neighborhood that's found new life in recent years as rehabbers buy up its blighted old mansions and restore them into beautiful urban homes.\\" Franklin Heights Franklin Heights is bordered by Capitol Drive to the north, 20th Street to the east, Burleigh Street to the south, and 35th Street to Townsend Street to the railroad tracks on the west. One third of the Franklin Heights population lives below the poverty line. Granville Granville is a historically working-class neighborhood located on Milwaukee's far northwest side, featuring new subdivisions, industrial parks, and Granville Station. Formerly the Northridge mall, the Station has undergone extensive renovations and is attracting new large-format tenants. Grover Heights Located on the fringes of Williamsburg and encompassing parts of Glendale, Grover Heights is bordered by the Milwaukee River to the north, Port Washington Avenue to the east, Capitol Drive to the south and I-43 to the west. Built on lots carved from swampland or wetlands that bordered the river, Grover Heights‚Äô houses were built between 1926 and 1930. Its occupants were primarily German until the 1960s, when immigrant descendants moved to the suburbs. Its first African-American family moved into the area in 1961. The neighborhood has had high stability. Currently Grover Heights has a diverse population consisting of African Americans, Caucasians, and Latinos. Its area forms one of the primary borders of the 5 Points Neighborhood Association, Inc. Halyard Park Halyard Park is bordered by North Avenue to the north, Dr Martin Luther King Jr Drive (3rd Street) to the east, Walnut Street to the south and 6th Street / Halyard Street to the west. It is a residential neighborhood; new condominiums and sprawling residential lots with post-1980 construction are the norm. Carver Park buffers the area from I-43 and is the area's largest park. It was the site of speeches from visiting US presidents in the early 1900s. Beechie Brooks, resident, was the developer who in the early 1980s redeveloped the area from Brown Street north to Garfield Avenue and from 4th Street west to Halyard Street. Harambee Harambee is a Swahili word for \\"pulling together\\". Since the mid-1970s, it has become the most widely used name for a neighborhood on Milwaukee's north side. There is a strong push to redefine the larger area into the Upper Riverwalk District as the entire area is located between two points in the Milwaukee River and has close proximity to the expanding river walk. Draped across a steep ridge overlooking Downtown, the Harambee area is a community of historic homes, churches, and more than 20,000 people. Its name signifies two things: the African heritage of most residents; and a new spirit of \\"pulling together\\" that has taken root in an old neighborhood. The Harambee community is just north of downtown Milwaukee and is bounded by Keefe Avenue to the north, Holton Street to the east, North Avenue to the south, and I-43 to the west. Harambee includes the highest residential elevation in the city, a tall ridge running along 1st Street. Between 1890 and 1910, well-to-do families built mansions on the North Side. Only a few are genuine mansions; the wealthiest Germans lived on the East and West Sides. Some are picturesque Queen Annes, with corner turrets and rambling floor plans. In 1984, the First Street corridor became an official historic district, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. This area was first settled by German immigrants in the 19th century and served as a key German-American business community for Milwaukee. Daniel Richards, who started Milwaukee's first newspaper, bought a home in 1842 at 2863 N. 1st Street on 160 acres (65 ha) of land that ran from Richards Street west to between 5th and 6th and from Center Street north to Burleigh Street. The home stood until 2002. Richards Hill is located immediately north of Hadley Street between 2nd Street and Palmer, and is the location of the highest natural point in the city. Richards Hill contains thousands of perennials planted by Daniel Richards 160 years ago. The city limits expanded to the north, reaching Center Street in 1855 and Burleigh a year later. In the 1870s, however, city residents crossed North Avenue and began to develop the former farming district. By 1900, the tide of settlement had reached near Burleigh Street. First, Second and Palmer streets (between North Avenue and Center Street) became the major \\"gold coast\\" of the North Side German community. The streets were lined with the homes of merchants, manufacturers, and professionals. Perhaps the best known was Edward Schuster, founder of what was, for decades, Milwaukee's largest department store chain. Wealthy residents organized the Millioki Club and built a lavish clubhouse at First and Wright streets. As the neighborhood filled in, its northeastern corner was developed as a large-scale industrial district. The neighborhood remained heavily ethnic German through the 1920s, but there were signs of demographic change. Many of the new residents in the northern sections were ethnic Polish and Italian families, immigrants and their descendants who had moved across Holton Street from the Riverwest neighborhood. In the southern sections, scores of German families moved on to new neighborhoods, and the blocks above North Avenue provided homes for a variety of groups, among them African Americans. The first Black families arrived in the 1930s, during the Great Migration from the South. They moved up the Third Street corridor, establishing new churches, opening new businesses, and developing a distinct cultural presence. By 1970, African Americans were the largest group in the neighborhood. A significant number of European residents remained and there was a growing Hispanic community in the blocks just west of Holton Street. Some sections are thoroughly mixed today, but African Americans are the major influence in the Harambee neighborhood. Juneteenth, the African-American community's largest celebration of emancipation, has been celebrated in the neighborhood on Third Street since 1972. In 1985, at the urging of local residents, the street's name was changed to celebrate Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. There have been grassroots efforts to preserve and improve the area's quality of life by working to strengthen a sense of community. The oldest grassroots organization is the Central North Community Council, established in 1960. The council's perennial president was Frank Zeidler, former mayor of Milwaukee, the last socialist to run a major U.S. city, and a neighborhood resident from 1946 until his death in 2006. The focus on citizen involvement broadened in the early 1970s. The Center for Community Leadership Development, began to explore ways to assist the neighborhood. Using a community school as its namesake, they organized the Harambee Revitalization Project. The most novel plan called for an \\"in-town, new town,\\" linking a revitalized Harambee neighborhood with a new community of transplanted North Siders outside the city. =Bronzeville= Bronzeville was an African-American neighborhood that historically was situated between what is now the Harambee neighborhood and the North Division neighborhood. Specifically, Bronzeville was bordered by North Avenue to the north, 3rd Street to the east, State Street to the south, and 12th Street to the west. Developing and active roughly between 1900 and 1950, much of this former district was centered along Walnut Street (essentially halfway between State Street and North Avenue). It was split up by governmental condemnation and acquisition of land to construct Interstate 43 and other arterial road expansions. These changes displaced much of the community. Today there is a rebuilding and rebranding of the commercial area of nearby North Avenue and Dr Martin Luther King Jr Drive into \\"Bronzeville\\", including many new businesses. The Black Holocaust Museum, founded by James Cameron, who survived a lynching attempt in the South, closed in 2008. After operating online, it is scheduled to re-open in 2018 a newly renovated space at the Griot Building at 411 W. North Avenue, to reopen in 2018. It will be managed by the Dr. James Cameron Legacy Foundation. The name \\"Bronzeville\\" is not Milwaukee-specific, as in other cities, it was used here to refer to an area populated primarily by African Americans, referring to their many shades of brown and bronze skin tones. File:America's Black Holocaust Museum.jpgBlack Holocaust Museum on 4th and North Havenwoods Havenwoods is bordered by West Mill Road to the north, North Sherman Boulevard to the east, West Silver Spring Drive to the south and 60th Street to the west. It is a working class, mostly African-American neighborhood on Milwaukee's north side, centered near Silver Spring Drive and 60th Street. The neighborhood is moderately urban in character, with a mix of strip malls, older retail buildings, and townhouses. Within the neighborhood's boundaries lie the Havenwoods State Forest and the US Army Reserve Center. The largest government housing project in Milwaukee is located in Havenwoods. Approximately 700 housing units stretching eight city blocks make up the Westlawn housing projects.

It includes Carver Park, which was known as Lapham Park until the 1950s. The Pabst Brewery Complex is situated in the far southwest corner of the Hillside neighborhood. The Pabst brewery was closed in 1997; however, the property is under redevelopment and speculation.

Metcalfe Park is often considered one of Milwaukee's most dangerous neighborhoods.JS Online: The faces, hearts of a troubled neighborhood It is one of the poorest; according to the U.S. Census, the poverty rate for the neighborhood and adjoining areas exceeds 60%. In 2002, after a mob of youths and children fatally beat a man, it drew national attention. The neighborhood continues to make efforts to improve. For instance, new commercial and residential development have recently sprung up along North Avenue, a main thoroughfare. The neighborhood has many active community groups, which aim to help improve the conditions in and image of Metcalfe Park. Midtown Midtown is bordered by North Avenue to the north, 20th Street to the east, Highland Avenue to the south, and railroad tracks to the west. This neighborhood on Milwaukee's northwest side is still struggling to improve through commercial redevelopment and a few nonprofit organizations. Park West Park West is a neighborhood located on the northwest side of Milwaukee. It is bordered by Burleigh Street to the north, 20th Street to the east, North Avenue to the south, and 27th Street and railroad tracks to the west. Sherman Park Sherman Park is located on the northwest side of Milwaukee. It is bordered by Capitol Drive to the north, 35th Street to the east, North Avenue to the south and 60th Street to the west. The Sherman Park area was once home to some of Milwaukee's first business owners. Those people built their homes in the 1920s and 1930s at the westernmost point of the city at the time. Sherman Blvd. and Grant Blvd. are streets with lavish houses. In the summer of 2016, Sylville Smith was shot and killed by a police officer in the neighborhood, leading to minor unrest followed by significant community development, neighborhood engagement and community building. The unrest has become a catalyst for growth and a reclamation of the neighborhood's tradition of community and diversity.After Riots Trememndous Positive Energy, The Wisconsin Jewish Chronicle Sherman Park was once the heart of Milwaukee's Jewish population. Sherman Park has a small, close-knit, and growing group of Orthodox Jews. Herb Kohl, former U.S. Senator and owner of the Milwaukee Bucks and his college roommate Bud Selig, former MLB commissioner and owner of the Milwaukee Brewers, both grew up in Sherman Park in the 1940s and attended Washington High School, which is located in the neighborhood. Since 1970, the neighborhood has had a community association focused on preserving Sherman Park's cultural diversity, housing stock, and commercial viability.Saltman, Juliet. A Fragile Movement: The Struggle for Neighborhood Stabilization. New York: Greenwood Press, 1990. Today, Sherman Park is one of the most diverse neighborhoods in Milwaukee and one of the city's only truly integrated communities. It is especially noteworthy for its beautiful housing stock, with the greatest variety of distinctive architectural specimens in the city.Gurda, John Milwaukee: City of Neighborhoods 2015 The Uptown Crossing is a commercial district is located on West North Avenue and Lisbon Avenue and is a part of Sherman Park that is home to a variety of national and local retail, as well as several public institutions.

Some consider Williamsburg as a section of the newer Harambee neighborhood to the south. In the 1800s, when memories of the frontier were still fresh in Milwaukee, the area that became Williamsburg (named for William Bogk) was a farming district. Scores of farmers, most of them German immigrants, settled in the area. Comfortably beyond the city limits, (North Avenue), they patronized their own trading center that they referred to as Williamsburg. The Green Bay road, between Burleigh Street and Keefe Avenue, was the spine of the little settlement. At its peak, Williamsburg boasted a flour mill, greenhouses, feed stores, harness shops, blacksmiths, bakeries, and its own post office. At Port Washington Road there were a growing cluster of businesses on Green Bay Avenue ‚Äì the heart of old Williamsburg. The residential sections were dotted with German saloons, German stores, and dozens of German churches. Most of the area's breadwinners were skilled artisans and tradesmen. In 1891, Williamsburg, by then a suburban community of blue-collar workers, became part of Milwaukee. In the same decade, the Pabst Brewery purchased Schuetzen Park (presently Clinton Rose Park) and developed it as an amusement park. The beer garden remained, but the rifle range was replaced by a roller coaster, a miniature railroad, a carousel, and a fun house called Katzenjammer Castle. The area continued to grow after 1900. The tide of home-seekers washed down the ridge to Keefe Avenue before 1910 and finally reached Capitol Drive in the 1920s. Old Williamsburg became an island of older homes and shops in the heart of the neighborhood. The homes here are dominantly bungalows, the nearly universal favorite of the 1920s, with two- and three-story Milwaukee duplexes scattered among them. Williamsburg Heights and Williamsburg Triangle also form the primary borders and constituents of the 5 Points Neighborhood Association, Inc. (5PNA). In the late 1960s, African Americans began to move in. Relations were more peaceful between the newer group and their older ethnic European neighbors when compared to other parts of the city. The neighborhood was quite stable through this period of change. The former Oak Club was adapted as the Shiloh Tabernacle. Milwaukee's South Side For many residents, Milwaukee's South Side is synonymous with the Polish immigrant community which settled here. The group's proud ethnicity maintained a high profile here for decades. In the postwar era, with newer housing being built in the suburbs, in the 1950s and 60s some well-established families began to disperse to the southern suburbs. By 1850, there were seventy-five Poles in Milwaukee County and the US Census indicates that they had a variety of occupations: grocers, blacksmiths, tavernkeepers, coopers, butchers, broommakers, shoemakers, draymen, laborers, and farmers. Three distinct Polish communities evolved in Milwaukee, with the majority settling in the area south of Greenfield Avenue. Milwaukee County's Polish population of 30,000 in 1890 rose to 100,000 by 1915. Poles historically have had a strong national cultural and social identity, maintained through the Catholic Church. A view of Milwaukee's South Side Skyline is replete with the steeples of the many churches these immigrants built, churches that are still vital centers of the community. Milwaukee's South Side has a multi-cultural population of African Americans, Caucasians, Asian Americans and a Hispanic population made up mostly of people of Mexican and Puerto Rican backgrounds. Bay View Bay View is located on the southeast shore of the city of Milwaukee overlooking Lake Michigan. Bay View boundaries are Becher Street/Bay Street to the north, Morgan Avenue to the south, and Sixth Street to the west.Bay View Today Located about 3 miles (5 km) south of downtown on the lake, Bay View originally was developed as a company town by the Milwaukee Iron Company, located near its rolling mill. It is south of Downtown and borders I-94 and I-43. Bay View incorporated in 1879 (Milwaukee's first suburb) with 2,592 people and 892 acres (361 ha) of land; but by 1887 Bay View's 4,000 residents voted overwhelmingly to join the city of Milwaukee, mostly in order to get city services, of which water was the most important. The former village became Milwaukee's 17th ward. Bay View is best known to labor historians as the site of the 1886 Bay View Massacre. Father James Groppi, a noted Milwaukee civil rights activist from the 1960s, was born in Bay View, where his father ran a grocery business. In the 21st century, the neighborhood used to host the annual South Shore Water Frolics, a free three- day summer festival featured a parade, live music and fireworks, was held at South Shore Park. Today the neighborhood has the last remaining public well in the city of Milwaukee: the Pryor Avenue Iron Well.

The neighborhood is home to the Milwaukee County Mitchell Park Conservatory ‚Äì where visitors can enter the beehive-shaped glass domes ‚Äì and Cesar Chavez Drive, a commercial strip that draws Milwaukee's Latino community and others to shop, eat authentic Latin food, and enjoy the vibrant atmosphere. Located near the emerging economic engine of Menomonee Valley and international tourist attractions such as Potawatomi Casino, Miller Park, and the Harley-Davidson Museum, Clarke Square is a gateway to Milwaukee ºs Near South Side. Holler Park Holler Park is a medium-sized neighborhood park held by Milwaukee County containing mature old-growth oak trees and abundant wildlife, including Whitetail Deer, Raccoons, Opossums, Geese, Ducks, Great Horned Owls, Hawks and varied bird species. Because of the amount of commercial property here, it is not classified as a residential neighborhood. Jackson Park Jackson Park is a neighborhood on the south side, located about 6 miles (10 km) south of downtown. It is bordered by Lincoln Ave to the north, Morgan Ave to the south, 35th St to the east, and 50th St to the west. Jackson Park's architecture consists largely of two-story wood frame houses that were constructed in the early 20th century. Jackson Park's makeup is mostly ethic European, working middle-class, government and blue collar workers. Since the late 20th century, an increasing number of Hispanic residents have moved here. Jones Island Jones Island is a peninsula located at the Milwaukee Harbor. It began as a fishing village populated by Polish settlers from the Kaszub region as well as some German immigrants in 1870. The settlers made their living by fishing Lake Michigan. Having never officially obtained deeds for the land, they were considered squatters by the City of Milwaukee and evicted in the 1940s. The city developed the property for a shipping port as part of an inner harbor design. The area is now heavily industrialized, containing only a few mature trees. Jones Island hosts much of the city's municipal services, including the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District. The area supports the Hoan Bridge and includes a shipping port, the Port of Milwaukee. File:Kaszube's Park from street.jpgKaszube's Park at Jones Island. Layton Park Layton Park is located on the city's near southwest side. The neighborhood is bordered by 35th Street in the west and by Historic Layton Boulevard to the east. Layton Park is today a diverse neighborhood with a large Latino population. The neighborhood was developed in the 1920s and comprises red brick bungalows and duplexes. Lincoln Village This neighborhood is located along Lincoln Avenue between 5th and 20th streets on the south side of Milwaukee. Lincoln Village contains a national landmark, the Basilica of St. Josaphat. The Holler House tavern, which contains the oldest certified bowling alley in the United States, is located on the far west end of the neighborhood. The Historic Forest Home Cemetery is located just west, adjacent to the neighborhood. During the early 20th century, this neighborhood was home to a large immigrant and ethnic Polish population. As they moved out, in the 21st century, the neighborhood is inhabited predominately by an ethnic Mexican population. Many have immigrated from rural areas of Mexico or moved from Los Angeles.Lincoln Village Main Street File:Basilica of St. Josaphat.jpgBasilica of St. Josaphat, on Lincoln and 5th St. File:SaintJosaphatBasilica.JPGThe Basilica of Saint Josaphat.

The Mitchell Street neighborhood is the heart of a densely populated area of Milwaukee's near south side. Most of the houses in the neighborhood are two- or three-story Polish flats, but this area also has a fair amount of five to six-story brick walk-ups and apartment buildings. Mitchell Street is a popular and vibrant retail district. File:St Stanislaus Catholic Church.jpgSt. Stanislaus Catholic Church on Mitchell at 5th Tippecanoe Tippecanoe is located on the city's far south side; it is a solidly middle class and well- maintained neighborhood. Most of the neighborhood's homes date back to the 1940s and 1950s. The area was named from the political rallying cry \\"Tippecanoe and Tyler too\\" by landowner John Saveland, an outspoken local Republican. He initially developed it as an upper-income suburban community. Town of Lake Town of Lake, located near the Mitchell airport, is a neighborhood based on its namesake township. This was established by the Territorial Legislature in 1838 and covered much of what is now the south side of Milwaukee, as well as the city of Cudahy. Over time, the township was parceled out among different area cities. The original boundaries for the Town of Lake were Greenfield Ave to the north, Lake Michigan to the east, College Ave (originally called Town Line Rd) to the south, and 27th Street to the west. In 1951, St. Francis incorporated to prevent annexation by Milwaukee, in effect \\"seceding\\" from the Town of Lake. Before being annexed, the township's northern boundary was Howard Ave, except for a strip of land west of 20th Street going farther north to Morgan Ave. The old town hall on 6th and Howard is still referred to as the \\"Town of Lake Water Tower\\". Now officially called the Robert A. Anderson Municipal Building by the City of Milwaukee, it currently serves as office space and water treatment facility. The Town of Lake was officially annexed in 1954. The township's residents had voted not to incorporate as the \\"City of Lake\\" in 1928; had they chosen to incorporate, the remaining area of the Town of Lake would probably have never been annexed by Milwaukee, and Milwaukee would have likely expanded further west and north instead. In addition, it is also likely that the Milwaukee suburb of St. Francis would not have felt the pressure to incorporate. File:Town of Lake.jpgTown of Lake Water Tower Walker's Point Walker's Point is a neighborhood that lies south of the Third Ward and the eastern part of the Menomonee River Valley. Founded by George H. Walker in 1835 as a fur trading post, the area is now noted for being mostly an industrial neighborhood, with limited housing scattered in pockets throughout the area, particularly on the eastern end of Walker's Point. The city's gay and lesbian community actively use the nightclubs and bars in the neighborhood. Recently, this area has seen some condo, office, and retail development spill over the Milwaukee River to this neighborhood. However, it is not displacing anyone as the spaces undergoing development have mainly been former storage or empty industrial space. There has been attempt to revamp the area. The L. Teweles Seed Company warehouse, Fifth Ward Lofts, and the Milwaukee Water Council have been renovated. Rockwell Automation has their headquarters in this neighborhood. The Allen-Bradley Clock Tower, part of the Rockwell complex, is an icon of the neighborhood and is the world's largest four-faced clock, as listed in Guinness World Records. Esperanza Unida, a community-based nonprofit organization, is located on the western end of Walker's Point. Data security software provider and ZIP file creators PKWARE relocated their headquarters to the neighborhood in 2014. Local architecture firm Plunkett Raysich Architects, LLP relocated from its long-time location on the northwest side to the neighborhood in May 2015. File:Walker's Point.jpgWarehouse district File:Walkers point neighborhood milwaukee.jpgSouth down 2nd Street to Clock Tower Milwaukee's East Side=\\"The East Side\\" The East Side is a broad area that refers to anywhere east of the Milwaukee River, north of downtown, and south of the suburb of Shorewood. This area includes Brady Street, the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee campus, the lakefront, and the marina. The streets and buildings in this neighborhood range from towering, expensive high rises and condominiums along the lake to brownstones and walkups a few blocks inland to more affordable duplexes near the river. An economically diverse group of people live in this neighborhood. Brady Street (from Prospect to Holton) and North Avenue (from Prospect to the Milwaukee River) both feature popular, pedestrian-friendly commercial strips of nightlife, restaurants, and shops intermingled with residences. Brady Street is also known for its popular pet paradeBrady Street Pet Parade Event- pet parade which runs every first Saturday in October. Downer Avenue (from Bradford to Park) is a similar commercial strip but with fewer bars. Milwaukee County Transit System's bus routes 30/30X and Green Line Express are the major North-South transit arteries for the neighborhood. The east side is also home to renowned parks. Frederick Law Olmsted - famed designer of New York's Central Park - designed both Lake Park and Riverside Park (originally \\"River Park\\"), with Newberry Boulevard being the deliberate connector between the two. Lake Park is part of Milwaukee's Grand Necklace of Parks and is known for lawn bowling; French restaurant, the Lake Park Bistro; and the North Point lighthouse.

Looking west down Lyon street. =Lower East Side= Lower East Side is a neighborhood North of Downtown and East of Riverwest. It is bounded by the Milwaukee River on the west, Lake Michigan on the east, North Avenue on the north and State Street on the south. Brady Street itself runs west from Prospect Avenue (overlooking the Lake) to Water Street. In the 1880s, Brady Street became a commercial district of Yankee and German owned shops., p. 9 Regano's Roman Coin, one of the original Pabst tied house taverns, is still located on Brady Street, though the vintaged beer signs outside read \\"Blatz\\". This tavern was built in 1890 and is unique in that it was designed by architect Otto Strack, who also designed Milwaukee's Pabst Theater., p. 18 Today, Lower East Side is filled with coffee houses, nightclubs, restaurants, vintage clothing, and thrift stores. Lower East Side is often associated with being once the heart of Milwaukee's Italian community, even being called \\"Milwaukee's Little Italy\\". But before World War II, it was largely home to Polish immigrants. In fact, historic St. Hedwig's Roman Catholic Church, a long-time Polish church, which was built in 1871, stands at the corner of Brady Street and Humboldt Avenue. In the 1960s, Italians and other assimilated groups began to leave the neighborhood for the suburbs, while the hippies and other bohemians moved in. The 1980s saw blight, neglect and decay, but now the area has been revitalized and has become a model for New Urbanism. Starting in the late 1990s, most of the bohemian population moved to Riverwest and Bay View. But this neighborhood still exhibits a strong, albeit upscale, independent flair. For instance, the annual Brady Street festival in July brings together the neighborhood in block party fashion.

The Bus Shelter was the first component of the Crossroads Project, which includes the Marsupial Bridge, Media Garden, and Viewing Pavilion (alongside Commerce Street), which renovates the last remaining segment of the trestle of Beerline B railway. Defunct Beerline railway =East Village= The East Village is a term for the Lower East Side area on the east bank of the Milwaukee River north of Brady Street, from Humboldt Avenue east to Warren Avenue. Most of the neighborhood makes up the Brewers Hill Historic District, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It includes Caesar's Park, Pulaski Playground, and Wolski's Tavern. The area was a traditional working-class neighborhood inhabited by Polish-Americans, including many Kaszubs; the architecture includes a number of Polish flats and other forms of modest housing.View Summary/Photo Page =Murray Hill= Murray Hill is located adjacent to the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee within the larger East Side neighborhood. It is bounded by Downer Avenue on the east, Oakland Avenue on the west, Hartford Avenue on the north, and Bradford Avenue and North Avenue on the south. It is primarily a residential neighborhood with housing dating to the early decades of the 20th century, primarily bungalows, two-family duplexes, and larger apartment buildings. The neighborhood is bisected by Newberry Blvd. which connects parks on Lake Michigan (Lake Park) and the Milwaukee River (Riverside Park). Murray Hill is home to both a student population and many long-term residents. The neighborhood has an active neighborhood group, the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association. The childhood home of famous industrial designer Brooks Stevens Brooks Stevens was in Murray Hill. Riverwest Riverwest is a primarily residential neighborhood located west of the Milwaukee River and east of Holton Street, situated south of Estabrook Park, between Milwaukee's East Side, Brewers' Hill, Williamsburg Heights, and Harambee neighborhoods. It borders Capitol Drive to the north, The Milwaukee River to the east, North Avenue to the south and Holton Street to west The main east-west arterial streets - Capitol Drive, Locust Street, and North Avenue - connect Riverwest to the East Side via bridges. The main north-south arterial streets - Holton Street and Humboldt Boulevard - connect Riverwest to the downtown area, the lower East Side (specifically Brady Street), and suburban Shorewood. Along with those streets, Locust, Center, and Burleigh Streets are the major east- west corridors with cafes, bars, and shops where people congregate. Riverwest is one of the neighborhoods that established its boundaries and identity before the 1990s Neighborhood Identification Project. Riverwest is noted for its racial and ethnic diversity, including large numbers of African-Americans and Caucasians, as well as growing Iranian, Russian, Asian, and Hispanic populations. With the neighborhood's proximity to the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee, a sizable college student population also resides in there. Rapidly rising real estate values in the nearby east side neighborhoods have made Riverwest more attractive to home buyers due to its closeness to downtown and the university. This, along with other housing and commercial developments, followed a long period of decline up through the 1990s. More recently, the trend has been rising property values and an increase in owner- occupied housing. Riverwest still features more affordable rental opportunities in its bungalows, duplexes, and \\"Polish flats\\" than is generally found closer to the university. Riverwest's high level of racial and economic integration was studied in the 2017 book Live and Let Live by sociologist Evelyn M. Perry. Riverwest has many nonprofit and volunteer-run organizations, such as its neighborhood association, a community newspaper, a grocery co-op, Woodland Pattern Book Center, The Public House (co-op bar) co-op, an investment co-op, infoshop Milwaukee River Advocates, and a volunteer run Community Radio station. Riverwest has many festivals, including Locust Street Days, Center Street Daze. The Riverwest 24, Milwaukee's only 24-hour annual bike race, started in 2008 and features local bands with multiple block parties. The neighborhood also features the Riverwest Art Walk, the state's largest walking tour of artists' homes and studios, neighborhood galleries, and various alternative spaces. In 2003, the neighborhood was the subject of its own book, Riverwest: A Community History, by Tom Tolan. An excerpt from \\"Riverwest: A Community History\\" (2003; 197 pages; ) In 2011, the neighborhood was the subject of a play, Riverwest: a Rhapsody, written by Eric Theis, and performed by Broom Street Theater in Madison.

It is bordered by Interstate 43 on the east, 27th Street on the west, Interstate 94 on the south, and on the north by Highland Avenue. In decades past this neighborhood has been one of low income levels and property values. It was also home to Jeffery Dahmer, a notorious serial killer who murdered several of his victims at his apartment in the neighborhood Map. It has begun more recently to see some signs of redevelopment. The most commonly cited example being the Ambassador Hotel that, until recently, was linked with drug dealing and prostitution and has since been restored to an upscale establishment. Prostitution, although not quite as prevalent as it was in the 2000s is still a concern in the Avenues West area. In an attempt to help control crime in this area, Marquette University went so far as to provide a small additional station for the Milwaukee Police Department's 3rd District, fittingly named \\"Avenues West\\". Other notable places in the area include Marquette University, the Milwaukee Rescue Mission, the Pabst Mansion, the Joseph B. Kalvelage House and the Rave/Eagles Ballroom. The western portion of the neighborhood along 27th Street has been recently dubbed SoHi (i.e., South of Highland Boulevard) by the business owners to help jumpstart the area. On May 18, 2006 a construction worker unearthed human remains in the neighborhood believed to be the location of Milwaukee's first cemetery established in the First Ward (known as the \\"Old Cemetery\\") near 22nd and Michigan. Thirteen burials have since been identified, and archaeologists are unsure if they are remnants from the Old Cemetery or an earlier burial site used by a Potawatomi village.Uncovering a mystery of early residents, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, July 1, 2006. =University Hill= University Hill (or simply Marquette) is a campus neighborhood, generally combined with the Avenues West neighborhood (since it is within), that, as its name implies, is home to the Marquette University campus. The neighborhood encompasses from 9th Street on the east, to 20th Street on the west, and from Wells Street on the north, to Clybourn Street on the south. Wisconsin Avenue, a major thoroughfare in Milwaukee, bisects the campus neighborhood. The neighborhood is positioned adjacent northwest and partially northeast of the Marquette Interchange, which was named so because of its proximity to Marquette University. Lake Michigan is roughly one mile east of the neighborhood. Gesu Church is located within the campus' urban setting, but is not affiliated with the University. The area was at one time the site of the Wisconsin State Fairgrounds.

Cold Spring Park has been around since the mid-19th century. It is named for a natural spring that was found in the northwest corner of the neighborhood (then bounded by 27th Street, 35th Street, West Juneau Avenue, and Vliet Street). As far as crime, Cold Spring Park is a rather calm area, as opposed to other nearby sections of Milwaukee. In 1852, Cold Spring Park was the site of the Wisconsin State Agricultural Society fair and exhibition. During the American Civil War, Cold Spring Park became Camp Washburn, housing the 2nd Cavalry, 30th Infantry, and the 39th Regiment. After the Civil War, Cold Spring Park once again became a race track. A race that was commemorated by Currier and Ives depicted an 1871 record breaking race by the mare Goldsmith Maid, with a time of 2 minutes and 17 seconds. Adjacent to Cold Spring Park was the Cold Spring House, a hotel which housed visitors and drivers for the races. It was notorious for its gambling, cockfights, courtesans and dances. At the close of the 19th century, Milwaukee saw a population boom, prompting two new streets in Cold Spring Park; Highland Boulevard (1896) and McKinley Boulevard (1906). Cold Spring Park initially drew German-American residents of the moderate to upper income scale. The upper end residing primarily on Highland and McKinley, while the middle to moderate income resided on Juneau and the numbered streets. Highland Boulevard, Juneau Avenue, and McKinley Boulevard are designated as historical streets by the City of Milwaukee. Historic Concordia District Historic Concordia District is an area between 27th Street, 35th St, Wisconsin Avenue, and Highland Boulevard on Milwaukee's near west side. It is the home of both a local historic district and many nationally registered historic properties, such as the Tripoli Shrine Temple. Many Victorian homes in the neighborhood have been converted into bed and breakfasts. Notable homes include the 1850s Tower House and 1860s Col. Theodore Yates residence. Several private residences are opened to the public each year on the Saturday of Fathers Day weekend for a home tour by Historic Concordia Neighbors Inc. Concordia college (now known as Concordia University) was located in the neighborhood for 100 years, until 1983. The college's former facilities, between 31st and 33rd streets and State St. and Highland Blvd., are now home to the Indian Community School. File:Tripoli Shrine Temple.jpgTripoli Shrine Temple on Wisconsin at 30th Enderis Park The Enderis Park neighborhood is a primarily residential neighborhood bounded by North 76th Street, North 67th Street, West Center Street, and Burleigh/Lisbon Avenue. Many houses date from the 1930s and 1940s. The geographic and cultural heart of the neighborhood is the Enderis Playfield, named for Dorothy Enderis, a public recreation pioneer who retired as an assistant superintendent in the Milwaukee Public Schools teacher in 1948. In 2006, neighbors rallied to rejuvenate the park, which had fallen into disrepair. Magic Grove, a monumental steel sculpture by Wisconsin artist Nancy Metz White, was installed, providing a community gathering place in the park. Grantosa Heights Located between Granville and Wauwatosa, Grantosa Heights is a highly urban neighborhood with a diverse population. This is a lower middle class area with predominantly African-American and Laotian residents. The neighborhood is named after Grantosa Drive, which seems to be the border with Midtown. Much of the architecture consists of tract homes from the 1950s and 1960s. In recent years, this neighborhood has become home to many of the refugees that have fled Laos. Kops Park Kops Park is bordered by North 92nd Street to the west, West Burleigh Street to the south, West Lisbon Avenue to the north, and North 76th Street to the east. The neighborhood is centered around Kops Park, named after Gerald Henry Kops, a Milwaukee County Supervisor. Martin Drive The Martin Drive neighborhood is located on Milwaukee's west side. The neighborhood is located north and west of Miller Brewing Company. It includes Harley-Davidson and the Highland Avenue Viaduct. The neighborhood was built up in the 1920s and is home to several old apartment buildings. The neighborhood has retained its density and is still one of the safest neighborhoods in the city.Crime Statistics for the city of Milwaukee Martin Drive is bordered by Martin Drive in the south, 35th Street in the east, Vliet Street in the north, and WIS 175 in the west. Milwaukee's Washington Park is located adjacent, just north of the neighborhood. After several decades of stagnant growth the neighborhood is now seeing redevelopment with a few new businesses and building renovations. As such, the neighborhood supports many small and upstart businesses such as Eat Cake, Milwaukee Nut Company, a law office and State Street Animal Hospital among others. Martin Drive has several private and public schools nearby. Grocery stores, hardware stores and pharmacies are in close proximity to the Martin Drive Neighborhood. The neighborhood has a strong and dedicated volunteer-led neighborhood association, the Martin Drive Neighborhood Association.

Its traditional boundaries are 27th Street on the east, 35th Street on the west, Wisconsin Avenue on the north, and the Menomonee Valley on the south. Traditionally an Irish-American enclave, it is now an ethnically diverse neighborhood. There is little in the way of commerce in Merrill Park, largely confined to the boundary streets, which are major arterials. Merrill Park was an early home to Milwaukee's Irish community. Many Irish settled in Merrill Park along with the rest of the west side of Milwaukee. The southern portion of the neighborhood was demolished in the 1950s in order to build Interstate 94. The 1960s brought on several redevelopment projects including streetscaping, new homes, and a new public housing tower. Marquette University High School has stayed in the neighborhood and has invested heavily in improving its campus and the surrounding neighborhood. The neighborhood is seeing major physical improvements. Several new homes have been built on former vacant lots. Several old homes have been purchased and renovated. The Wisconsin Humane Society has made this neighborhood its primary location. Marquette University High School is undergoing a multimillion-dollar renovation and construction project as well. =Piggsville= Piggsville is a small residential enclave, four blocks by six blocks, at the west end of the Menomonee River Valley, south of Miller Brewing and the Wisconsin Avenue viaduct, and north of Interstate 94. Various theories have been proposed about its name, but none have been proven true. It is also known as Valley Park, and its neighborhood association is the Valley Park Civic Association. Most of its homes were built in the early 20th century. The area was annexed by the City of Milwaukee in 1925 after petition by its residents. Flooding has been a problem because of its river valley location, and a new concrete retaining wall was built in 2000. Mount Mary Mount Mary surrounds Mount Mary University. It is bordered by Concordia Ave. on the north, 89th St. on the east, Center St. on the south and Menomonee River Parkway on the west.Greg Pearson, \\"Mount Mary provides anchor College and river parkway community a study in harmony\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, June 3, 2001. With several curvilinear streets and fewer sidewalks, it resembles a suburban neighborhood. Most of the homes were built in the 1950s. The City of Wauwatosa is to the south and to the west. Milwaukee County Kops and Cooper Parks also border this neighborhood. Portions are also named Golden Valley which is composed of 1950s tract homes built primarily by Welbilt Homes and Corrigan Builders. Story Hill Story Hill is a neighborhood located directly north of Miller Park and south of the Washington Heights neighborhood, on the west side of Milwaukee. Story Hill is named for Hiram Story. Hiram, along with his brother Horace, founded a quarry on the land in this neighborhood. The neighborhood itself lies on a hill just south of Wisconsin Avenue and is characterized by quiet, tree-lined streets and an isolated feel, in sharp contrast to the busier and more depressed neighborhoods that surround it. Story Hill was developed in the 1920s as a sanctuary for middle class Milwaukeeans living just east toward downtown, in the once affluent Concordia district. Demand for larger lots and a more suburban feel fueled the development of Story Hill. The housing stock consists of ornate early 20th-century houses, usually made of brick. Walnut Hill Walnut Hill is a predominantly African-American neighborhood on the west side, bordered by 27th Street, 35th Street, Vliet Street, and North Avenue. There is also a strong southeast Asian (Hmong) presence here. The neighborhood is one of the most blighted in the city. Parts of the neighborhood include streets without homes and large vacant lots. Despite severe problems in the neighborhood, several homes are under construction and some middle-income proposals are beginning to be seen. Washington Heights Washington Heights is a neighborhood characterized by its 1920s Arts and Crafts housing stock. The boundaries of Washington Heights are 60th St. on the west, North Ave. on the north, 47th St. and Washington Park on the east, and Vliet St. on the south. Washington Heights should not be confused with The Washington Highlands, a neighborhood on the other side of 60th St., in Wauwatosa, a suburb of Milwaukee. St. James Evangelical Lutheran Church is a prominent congregation in the area, dating back to the 1920s. Mount Olive Lutheran Church and School situated across the street from Saint Sebastian Catholic Church and School, built respectively in the 1920s and 1930s, at North 54th Street and Washington Boulevard, are large congregations which both serve as strong cornerstones within the neighborhood. There has been significant business growth along its Vliet Street corridor, with many new art galleries, wine shops and restaurants. One business, a long time coffee shop recently turned pizzeria, is unique in that it has a large coffee cup on the roof. The central administrative office building of Milwaukee Public Schools is located in this neighborhood. Washington Heights, a neighborhood that advertises itself as, \\"In the City ‚Äî Out of the Ordinary!\\" lies along Milwaukee's western border. While the neighborhood is now only minutes from downtown and close urban amenities, this area was once considered remote. Development of the area began in 1838 when the federal government gave a parcel of land to the Wisconsin Territory. The land was intended for a canal that would connect the Rock River to Lake Michigan, but the venture quickly failed. The land was sold to private investors. In 1839, roughly two-thirds of what is now known as Washington Heights was purchased by George Dousman and turned into an immense farm. In addition to its agricultural operation, the Dousman family founded the Ne-Ska-Ra Mineral Springs Company, which sold bottled water from a spring on their property. Today an elementary school named Neeskara occupies the land where the spring flowed. Later, the Dousman land was sold in several parcels between the 1880s and the 1920s. Early settlement of the area owed much to two major 19th Century projects ‚Äî the extension of the streetcar line to Wauwatosa and the construction of Washington Park. The area has a notably-strong neighborhood organization, the Washington Heights Neighborhood Association. File:The cup in washington heights milwaukee.jpgThe Cup on W Vliet by 50th Washington Park Washington Park is located on Milwaukee's West Side and is bordered by 35th street in the east, US-41 in the west, Vilet Street in the south and North Avenue in the north. Sherman Boulevard and Lisbon Avenue run through the neighborhood. Sherman Boulevard is lined with large brick homes and old trees. In the 1950s, Lisbon was a major business street, today though, with a rise in prostitution and the crime that comes with prostitution, it is home to several vacant storefronts. The neighborhood is now settled by a majority African American population. Washington Park, (originally West Park), a focal point and namesake of the neighborhood, was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, famed designer of New York's Central Park, and built in 1891. The Milwaukee County Zoo started in this neighborhood in 1892 as the \\"West Park Zoological Gardens,\\" a small mammal and bird exhibit in the West Park barn. On September 20, 1900, the West Park was renamed Washington Park and the zoo followed suit by renaming to Washington Park Zoo. The zoo was relocated to its present location when Washington Park lost an parcel of park property for the freeway expansion in the early 1960s. Ice skating and regular outdoor concerts occurred in Washington Park up until the early 1970s. Today, the park houses an amphitheatre and pool. In 2007, Milwaukee's Urban Ecology Center (headquartered in Riverside Park on the East Side) opened at satellite center in the park in an effort to help rejuvenate the run-down green space and provide interactive programming of nature to local youth. At the intersection of Lisbon and Sherman, the heart of the neighborhood, stands an equestrian statue of Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, a German general who assisted George Washington in the American Revolutionary War. Across from this traffic circle stands the new Washington Park Library, which has replaced the old Boulevard Inn, which burned down in the 1990s. Milwaukee's Downtown=East Town The East Town neighborhood encompasses the eastern portion of downtown Milwaukee's central business district from the Milwaukee River on the west to Lake Michigan on the east, and from Ogden Avenue (i.e., the lower East Side) on the north to Clybourn (i.e., the Third Ward) on the south. Yankee Hill is a key part of the East Town neighborhood, being situated within East Town's boundaries, but closer to the lake and north of downtown. The East Town area also contains the historic Juneau Town settlement, which had competed with the neighboring Kilbourn Town (present-day Westown) for people and resources. With the Milwaukee River as the division, these two \\"towns\\" have remarkably different feels. East Town has dense, narrower streets and a more intimate feel, whereas Westown has broad, vast streets with older buildings. The buildings in East Town are indeed newer. The strikingly modern skyscrapers of the Northwestern Mutual Life complex and Milwaukee's tallest building, the U.S. Bank Center, as well as the city's four other tallest buildings, dominate the eastern portion of the neighborhood. Other noteworthy buildings include the Chase Bank building, the Wisconsin Gas Building, the Faison building, and the Morgan Stanley building. Two large condominium developments, Kilbourn Tower and University Club tower, have been recently completed in the northern half of the neighborhood. Both buildings are over 32 stories tall and have multimillion-dollar penthouse units. The neighborhood also contains the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist and Old St. Mary's Church which have survived from the early days of Milwaukee. The East Town neighborhood association hosts Jazz in the Park, an outdoor music concert series at Cathedral Square Park. The area has become the center of Milwaukee nightlife featuring several trendy nightclubs, and outdoor upscale eateries. In summer, East Town sponsors the Parisian festival Bastille Days and in winter the Holiday City of Lights. The Milwaukee School of Engineering campus is also located in this neighborhood.

Despite decades of decline, the Valley is still home to several manufacturers, the Potawatomi Casino, and Miller Park, the home field of the Milwaukee Brewers. The Menomonee Valley is also home to the Harley-Davidson Museum, which opened in July 2008. Redevelopment in the Menomonee Valley has added thousands of jobs and transformed once-blighted former industrial land into parkland and community gathering space. In 2007, the Sierra Club recognized the Menomonee Valley as a national example of environmentally friendly urban renewal.

The Third Ward is noted for a large number of condominium and loft apartments, antique stores, boutiques and art galleries. Access to Milwaukee's Maier Festival Grounds, best known for Summerfest, can be obtained from through this neighborhood. It is home to the Milwaukee Institute of Art & Design, ComedySportz, and it is also a center of Milwaukee's gay and lesbian community. Located just west of this now trendy neighborhood of nightclubs and outdoor \\"River Walk\\" restaurants, is Milwaukee's main transportation hub and the Milwaukee Intermodal Station, which services Amtrak, Greyhound Bus Lines, and Badger Bus. The neighborhood is referred to as the Historic Third Ward since redistricting over the years currently has the area in the fourth (political) ward. File:Third Ward MKEa.jpgHistoric Third Ward Westown Westown is an area west of the Milwaukee River and downtown, bounded by I-794 on the south, Marquette University neighborhood on the west, McKinley Avenue on the north, and the Milwaukee river on the east. The neighborhood comprises the original Kilbourn Town in what is now downtown Milwaukee. The Shops of Grand Avenue, along with various theaters, restaurants, nightclubs, lies along Wisconsin Avenue. Other attractions in this neighborhood include the Milwaukee Public Museum, the Bradley Center, the US Cellular Arena, the Milwaukee County Courthouse and Old World Third Street. The area has also become a focal point for Milwaukee's urban scene with events such as RiverSplash!, a three-day block party which begins Milwaukee's summer festival season, and River Rhythms, both held at Pere Marquette Park. The Westown neighborhood has seen a substantial amount of redevelopment since the 2000s. It is home to one of Milwaukee's two free, public Wi-Fi outdoor Hotspots located in Pere Marquette Park. Within West Town about 3,000 reside. Some skyscrapers like the Wisconsin Tower have been converted into upscale condominiums. The city of Milwaukee has wanted to develop Westown as a place to eat, work and live.

Located on Knowles Avenue and Bustleton Pike, it is now a private residence. The station was built in 1892, and served as a stop on the Reading Railroad's Newtown Line. It replaced another structure built in 1878. It was later taken over by SEPTA and served as a stop on the Fox Chase/Newtown Line. History The station, built in 1892, was a stop on the Reading Railroad's Newtown Line, and a replacement for another structure built in 1878. It was later taken over by SEPTA and served as a stop on the Fox Chase/Newtown Line. Churchville station, and all of those north of Fox Chase station, was closed on January 18, 1983 due to failing diesel train equipment resulting in low ridership. In addition, a labor dispute began within the SEPTA organization when the transit operator inherited 1,700 displaced employees from Conrail. SEPTA insisted on utilizing transit operators from the Broad Street Subway to operate Fox Chase- Newtown diesel trains, while Conrail requested that railroad motormen run the service. When a federal court ruled that SEPTA had to use Conrail employees in order to offer job assurance, SEPTA cancelled Fox Chase-Newtown trains. SEPTA must use Conrail workers rather than its own personnel to run trains over the region's 13 commuter lines, a special federal court has ruled in a decision that offers some job assurance for 1,700 Conrail employees next year. The special court, in an opinion issued Wednesday, ruled that SEPTA had acted legally in October when it replaced Conrail workers with its former subway operators on the line. Service in the diesel-only territory north of Fox Chase was cancelled at that time, and Churchville station still appears in publicly posted tariffs.SEPTA Tariff No. 154 Although rail service was initially replaced with a Fox Chase-Newtown shuttle bus, patronage remained light, and the Fox Chase-Newtown shuttle bus service ended in 1999.

Nature, 1998. 393(6682): p. 255-257. The first specimen was found in Utatsu-cho (now part of Minamisanriku-cho), Miyagi Prefecture, Japan. It is the only described species in the genus Utatsusaurus and the only member of the family Utatsusauridae. The name Utatsusaurus was given after the city.Shikama, T., T. Kamei, and M. Murata, Early Triassic Ichthyosaurus, Utatsusaurus hataii Gen. et Sp. Nov., from the Kitakami Massif, Northeast Japan. Science Reports of the Tohoku University Second Series (Geology), 1977. 48(1‚Äì2): p. 77-97. The fossils have been found from the Lower Triassic of Miyagi Prefecture, Japan and British Columbia, Canada.Motani, R., Phylogeny of the Ichthyopterygia.

Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences, 2005. 33: p. 395-420. Description Utatsusaurus with a human to scale. Unlike the more advanced ichthyosaurs, Utatsusaurus has no dorsal fin and has a broad skull. The snout gently tapers, compared to the more rounded one of more derived ichthyopterygians.Cuthbertson, R.S., A.P. Russell, and J.S. Anderson, Reinterpretation of the cranial morphology of Utatsusaurus hataii (Ichthyopterygia) (Osawa Formation, Lower Triassic, Miyagi, Japan) and its systematic implications. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 2013. 33(4): p. 817-830. The postorbital underlaps the elongate posterior process of the postfrontal. This is an evident plesiomorphic condition for ichthyopterygians. For the size of the skull, the teeth are rather small, and arranged in a primitive groove. They have longitudinal grooves and were first thought to be longer and more acute than Grippia, which is a closely related ichthyosaur. But, after that, it was reported that they were rather bluntly pointed and robust by reexamining the holotype.Motani, R., Redescription of the dental features of an early Triassic ichthyosaur, Utatsusaurus hataii. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 1996. 16(3): p. 396-402. Utatsusaurus had small fins, with five digits.Motani, R., New information on the forefin of Utatsusaurus hataii (Ichthyosauria). Journal of Paleontology, 1997. 71(3): p. 475-479. In addition, those digits have up to five extra finger bones, which is referred to as hyperphalangy. The tail had a long low fin, suggesting that the animal swam by undulation, rather than using its paddles and tail. Utatsusaurus has transitional features between ancestral terrestrial amniotes and the more derived ichthyosaurs. First, the attachment of the pelvic girdle to the vertebral column was probably not robust enough to support the body on land unlike terrestrial amniotes. The pelvic girdle is attached to the vertebral column by the sacral ribs probably articulating with the ilium, but the ribs are not fused to the sacral vertebrae. Second, the humerus and femur of Utatsusaurus has the equal length. While all other ichthyosaurs have the longer humerus, terrestrial amniotes have the longer femur. Furthermore, the hindlimb of Utatsusaurus seems to be larger than the forelimb. They also used phylogenetic analyses and concluded that ichthyosaurs were a member of the Diapsida and the sister group of the Sauria. Paleobiology Restoration Utatsusaurus fed on a diet of fish. It has approximately 40 presacral vertebrae which are cylindrical, suggesting that it probably swam with an eel- like motion. Classification Fossil of Utatsusaurus hataii. Exhibit in the National Museum of Nature and Science, Tokyo. Ryosuke Motani from the University of California, Berkeley, and Nachio Minoura and Tatsuro Ando from Hokkaido University re-examined the fossils of Utatsusaurus in 1998 using computer imagery to reverse the distortion of the original skeleton. They found that Utatsusaurus was closely related to the lizard-like diapsid reptiles such as Petrolacosaurus, making ichthyopterygians a distant relative to lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They also used phylogenetic analyses and concluded that ichthyosaurs were a member of the Diapsida and the sister group of the Sauria.Additionally, in 2013, Cuthbertson and colleagues from the University of Calgary, Canada, using phylogenetic analyses, reported that Ichthyopterygia is a monophyletic group and Utatsusaurus and Parvinatator are a basal clade. Destruction of the Gyory≈´-kan Minamisanriku-cho, Japan is a renowned place which has yielded a number of fossils of ichthyosaurs and the holotype specimen of Utatsusaurus. A museum (called Gyory≈´-kan (È≠öÁ´úÈ§®), literally translating as \\"a house of fish-dragons\\") was built to keep and display those fossils, and over sixty thousand people had visited there a year. However, on Friday 11 March 2011, the museum was destroyed during the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami. At the time of the earthquake, the fossils of Utatsusaurus were kept at another place, and the majority of the other fossils displayed at the museum were salvaged, but the museum, itself has not yet been restored and reopened.http://www.geosociety.jp/hazard/content0069.html  See also  * List of ichthyosaurs * List of ichthyosaur type specimens * Timeline of ichthyosaur research ReferencesSources * Early Triassic ichthyosaurs Early Triassic reptiles of Asia Early Triassic reptiles of North America ","title":"Utatsusaurus"},{"id":"6380829","text":"Holland station is a defunct railroad station in Holland, Pennsylvania.

Since 1990, he has also periodically released material under his own name and under the moniker \\"Allen Clapp and his Orchestra.\\" Though Clapp's music is largely considered part of the Indie-pop genre, his music production techniques and lyrical content reflect a distinct sense of place‚Äîan attribute more common to indigenous folk music.  History  Clapp was raised two blocks from the San Francisco bay in a Joseph Eichler-built home in Foster City, CA, where his mother and big sister taught him piano as a young child. He also studied the violin until his teen years, when he hooked up with likeminded musicians Dan Jewett, Larry Winther, Chris Boyke and Maz Kattuah, and formed a garage band alternately known as The Batmen and The Morsels. The band disintegrated at the end of the 1980s, with Winther and Kattuah going on to form garage-rock band The Mummies, and Jewett leaving to form The Himalayans, a band which included a pre-Counting Crows Adam Duritz. Clapp and Boyke split off to explore more esoteric, folky material in the duo The Goodfellows, who performed regularly around Berkeley (where Clapp had graduated in 1989 with a major in English Literature), and San Francisco. The two later added a bass player, Neal Trembath (Pullman), a drummer, Tom Freeman (The Muskrats), a harmonica player, Juliet Pries, and a manager, Alison Hefner (Dirty Deeds). They gigged around the Bay Area as, variously, \\"Huck,\\" \\"Hunk,\\" and \\"Hulk\\" (cf. Spinal Tap). Clapp released one flexi as Huck on Winter's Mist records out of San Jose. In the midst of playing in those bands, Clapp had begun recording pop songs under his own name using a Radio Shack tie-clip microphone, a Roland RE-201 Space Echo and his Tascam Porta One four-track cassette recorder. The Roland Space Echo would become an important part of Clapp's production of musical soundscapes, helping him achieve a cool, coastal sound. Even to the casual observer, he was barely equipped to record a decent demo tape. But Clapp's keen ear for melody and economical pop arrangements captured the interest of Kattuah, who started the Four Letter Words record label while he was in the Mummies. Four Letter Words issued Clapp's first-ever release, a song called \\"Very Peculiar Feeling\\" on a split flexi-disc with Japanese pop band \\"Bridge.\\" (1990) He followed up with his first marquis release, the one-sided 45, A Change in the Weather. The single quickly sold out, and attracted interest from the Iowa City-based Bus Stop Label. In 1992, Clapp released \\"Mystery Lawn,\\" a 3-song EP on Bus Stop. Based on its success, Bus Stop owner Brian Kirk asked Clapp to release a full- length album‚Äîthe label's first. In 1994, Clapp released \\"One Hundred Percent Chance of Rain\\" under the name \\"Allen Clapp and his Orchestra\\" (Bus Stop) on vinyl and CD. Still recording on his four track with limited equipment, the album was praised as a lo-fi masterpiece. The album's second song, \\"Something Strange Happens\\" was considered a standout track, and has since appeared on various compilations and in two independent films. Soon after, Allen formed a band with his wife, Jill, on bass, and his old former bandmates‚Äînow former Mummies‚ÄîWinther on drums and Kattuah on guitar. Minty Fresh signed the group, and after a lineup change, the band rechristened themselves The Orange Peels, who have continued to change lineups and gone on to record for SpinART and Parasol records. \\"One Hundred Percent Chance of Rain\\" was reissued in 2000 by Bus Stop on CD and LP. Clapp released a second solo album in 2002, a spacey soft-rock exploration for March Records called \\"Available Light.\\" He returned to the \\"Allen Clapp and his Orchestra\\" moniker on his 2011 album \\"Mixed Greens,\\" and is now releasing a six-song collection, \\"Six Seasons,\\" in November, 2016 under his own name. In 2009, in preparation for the release of the fan-funded \\"2020\\" by The Orange Peels, Clapp formed his own label imprint: Mystery Lawn Music. Soon after, he began releasing music by other artists in the San Francisco Bay Area, many of whom had recorded at Clapp's studio. As of 2016, the label has a catalog of 20 releases and an artist roster of 18 associated acts. In late 2016, Mystery Lawn Music is slated to release its first artist compilation, \\"Friends & Frenemies,\\" featuring music from the history and future of the label.  Recent Projects  After being hit by a drunk driver on the way to the last show on The Orange Peels' Sun Moon tour in late 2013, Clapp and his wife Jill decided to move to the Santa Cruz Mountains. In spring of 2014, they bought a house on mountain in the northern San Lorenzo Valley and moved Mystery Lawn Studio into the lower level. Now called Mystery Lawn Mountain, Clapp continues to record and produce albums for like-minded musicians in Boulder Creek, California. Clapp has engineered and produced all recordings under his own name, as well as four out of six albums by his band The Orange Peels. He has also worked as a recordist, producer and mix engineer with The Ocean Blue (Waterworks), the eclectic Santa Cruz collective The Incredible Vickers Brothers, Alison Faith Levy, and three albums by Redwood City co-eds The Corner Laughers, among others. He recently finished production on his fourth solo release: Six Seasons, due out Nov. 11, 2016 on his own Mystery Lawn Music record label in conjunction with Minty Fresh and Redeye Distribution.

It is used as an anticonvulsant. History Sultiame was first synthesised in the laboratories of Bayer AG in the mid 1950s and eventually launched as Ospolot in Europe and other markets the early 1960s. It never became a registered drug in the United States. The brand was transferred to Desitin GmbH in 1993 and is sold in several European countries, in Israel, Japan, and Australia. Sultiame became established as a second-line drug for treatment of partial epilepsy in the 1960s and 1970s and was often used in combination with the established anticonvulsant phenytoin. Temporal lobe seizures appeared particularly responsive to sultiame. Doubts subsequently arose as to whether sultiame has intrinsic anticonvulsant properties. After discovering sultiame's ability to raise the blood levels of phenytoin, it was assumed that sultiame would only act in combination with phenytoin. This finding, together with the equivocal results of a study in the US, resulted in a quick decline of sultiame's use. It was only in 1988, that the German child neurologist Hermann Doose discovered its specific effects in benign focal epilepsies of childhood. Today, sulthiame is the drug of choice for benign focal epilepsies of childhood (such as benign rolandic epilepsy) in the German-speaking countries and Israel. Indications Historically, sultiame has been used to treat partial seizures. In Australia, it is currently registered for behavioural disorders associated with epilepsy; hyperkinetic behaviour; temporal lobe epilepsy; myoclonic seizures; grand mal attacks; and Jacksonian seizures.Pharmalab Pty Ltd. Product Information Ospolot (Sulthiame). In contrast to other sulfonamide drugs, sultiame is devoid of antibacterial activity. Adverse effects The more common adverse effects are ataxia, paraesthesia of face and limbs, hyperpnoea, dyspnoea, and anorexia. Less common adverse effects include giddiness, rash, Stevens‚ÄìJohnson syndrome, nausea, weight loss, leukopenia, headache, psychic changes, depression, drooling, increased pain, frequency of fits, insomnia, status epilepticus. Disturbances in calcium and vitamin D metabolism have been occasionally reported after long-term use.  Interactions  Sultiame taken together with primidone may lead to severe side-effects, including psychotic reactions. The addition of sulthiame to phenytoin therapy has shown to be followed by a rise in the serum levels of phenytoin. Sultiame may also lead to a rise of phenobarbitone blood levels. Alcohol must not be consumed during treatment. Overdose Vomiting, hypotension, headache, vertigo, ataxia, metabolic acidosis with hyperpnoea and catatonic state may occur.

Unlike most basketball teams, the Harlem Wizards are not primarily focused on winning games. Instead, their aim is to entertain the crowd using a variety of basketball tricks and alley oops. They perform fundraisers at local schools for the students and the rest of the community, displaying their fancy trickery through dribbling, passing, shooting, and dunking. Through these fundraisers, they have raised millions of dollars for \\"charitable organizations, schools, and foundations across the world.\\" The audience is not only there to watch the Wizards, but also to participate in the show. The Wizards get the crowd involved, often bringing children out onto the floor to be part of a basketball trick or a comedy act. The Wizards are a comedy basketball team that tour the country.

The World Championship of Basketball Tournament in Chicago asked Davis to provide an emergency 8th team to compete in the tournament. Within one week, Davis assembled the Dayton Dive Bombers. The Dive Bombers' first round opponent in the tournament was the previous World Champion, the Harlem Globetrotters. The Dive Bombers pulled the upset and the Globetrotters' manager, Abe Saperstein, refused to even shake Davis' hand after the game. Davis was intrigued by this event, and twenty years later, he decided to create his own show basketball team, the Harlem Wizards. Before Davis got into sports management and promotion, Howie Davis played semi-professional baseball for a couple years. He eventually managed the Brooklyn Dodgers football team, the Staten Island Stapes, and the Kokomo Clowns, who actually played in clown outfits. Before creating the Harlem Wizards, he was also a scout for the San Francisco Giants. In 1962, Davis created the Wizards, wanting to expand on Saperstein's idea of the Globetrotters. Davis wanted the Wizards to be an even more competitive, creative, and entertaining team than the Globetrotters. When Howie Davis died in 1992, his son, Todd Davis, took over as the President of the Harlem Wizards organization. Since 1962, the Wizards have played over 10,000 games, both in the United States and abroad. They have played on five different continents and in 22 different countries.

The school serves the north central section of Williamson County for students in grades 9‚Äì12. The school is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.  Administration  Shane Pantall is the principal of Franklin High effective July 1, 2020. The school has four assistant principals: Toby Ruth, Jason Eubanks, Sarah Reynolds, and Marlon Ruck. History Franklin High School was established in 1910, with 2 teachers and 20 students in an upstairs room in the Franklin Grammar School, located in the center of Franklin, Tennessee. The first graduating class, the class of 1912, consisted of 3 students. The first principal was Nell Shea. Franklin High School received its own building in 1926, and was located just outside the downtown area on Columbia Avenue. G.E. Craddock served as principal during the move, and brought 10 teachers and a senior class of 33 to the new building. In 1936, W.C. Yates became principal of Franklin High School. During his tenure, the school was accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools in 1941, and increased the number of teachers to 13, and the graduating senior class to 53. Daly Thompson became principal in the early 1950s and Barry Sutton became principal in 1955. In January 1956, the Franklin High School building burned down, leaving only the gym and basement standing. The school moved to local churches while a new building was constructed. The new location, still used today, was on the opposite side of Franklin, and had 19 classrooms. This new building was designed by William Thomas Black, a famous architect in the area. At the new location the staff increased again to 19 teachers, and taught a graduating class of 72. The senior class grew to 184 by 1967, and had 42 staff members. Carl Owen became principal in 1967, but only served for one year. During this year, Franklin High School was integrated and combined with Natchez High School. D.W. Sanders became principal in 1968, and was replaced in 1971 by Carl Pike. Brentwood High School was opened in 1982, pulling students from Franklin High school. Bob Lawson became principal in 1987, but only served for a year. In 1988, Doug Crosier was named principal, and the school building was renovated. Centennial High School was opened in 1996 to relieve crowding in the growing Franklin area. Dr. John Calton was principal for the 2000-01 school year, and after he resigned, Dr. Linda Miller was principal for a year. In 2002, Willie Dickerson was appointed principal served in the role for nearly 20 years until being promoted to a district-level administrative position. A new two-story Franklin High School was built between 2004 and 2006 on the site of the previous building. The construction cost $21 million. A ribbon-cutting ceremony and open house was held Jan. 22, 2006. Franklin celebrated its 100th anniversary throughout the 2009‚Äì2010 school year including at its annual Homecoming festivities in October and at a special video presentation in April. In 2016, WCS began to develop a campus master plan for FHS including improved athletic facilities, a new access road for better vehicle circulation, and expanded classroom facilities, primarily through the acquisition of the former Columbia State Community College Franklin campus, which is located next to the high school. At its March 13 meeting, the Williamson County Commission gave the former college campus to the district and approved $9 million for construction and renovations. The first phase of these campus improvements were completed in January 2018, with the reopening of the former Columbia State building as the Franklin High School Annex. The annex contains 16 traditional classrooms, in addition to science labs, administrative space, and a commons area. The new space can accommodate approximately 500 students. Franklin class of 1990 graduate Shane Pantall was named principal in 2020, following Dickerson's promotion to WCS executive director of secondary schools.  Mascot  Franklin's original mascot from the school's opening in 1910 was a Pioneer. In 1937, the mascot was changed to the Rebel. According to former principal Willie Dickerson, the 1937 annual described the reason for the new mascot at the then-segregated, all-white school saying \\"there was no animosity of the past ... we uphold these ideals and believe them to be right.\\" Although Franklin has kept its mascot as the Rebels, the original cartoon of a confederate rebel is no longer used in school branding or on school apparel. Instead, a big white \\"F\\" called the \\"Power F\\" encompassed by a maroon circle is used to symbolize Franklin High School instead. In July 2020, during the first week of principal Shane Pantall's tenure, a committee was formed to explore whether the school's mascot should be changed. Superintendent Jason Golden accepted the committee's recommendation to change the school's mascot and on August 18, 2020, Pantall announced the new mascot as \\"the admirals.\\" According to Pantall, \\"The Admirals was chosen because Franklin High is touted by the students, faculty and alumni as ‚ÄòThe Flagship‚Äô school of Williamson County and is the oldest high school in the district.\\" Academics and testing Franklin High School was the first high school in Tennessee to offer the International Baccalaureate program. The IB program combines a rigorous academic workload with community service hours and an extended essay. The school also offers numerous AP and Honors courses to students to promote academic rigor. In 2013, the school had an average ACT score of 24.6. That year, 449 students took a combined 794 AP exams, earning an 84% passing rate (score of 3 or better). Additionally, the school offers career and technical education courses in several areas including digital arts, television and film production, early childhood education, culinary arts, autonomous vehicle coding, criminal justice, marketing, and automotive collision repair. Arts Franklin High School offers band, chorus, theatre, and visual arts programs.  Band  The Franklin Band comprises three concert bands, percussion ensemble, marching band, fall color guard, winter guard, jazz band, and numerous chamber ensembles. The band is a 2014 recipient of the Sudler Shield, an international award for excellence in marching band.

The new international studies focus attracted 40 new students from the Chinatown area. History Benjamin Franklin High School, side facade with murals, 2016 Although housed in the 37-year-old building previously used by Central High School, Benjamin Franklin High School was dedicated on April 26, 1939. Two-thirds of the faculty and two-thirds of the student body were carried over from Central. Franklin's first principal, Dr. A. Oswald Michener, was to coordinate \\"the century-old tradition of Central High School with the modern spirit of scientific inquiry which Franklin represented.\\" Following World War II, nearly 5,000 returning veterans were provided with twelve to fourteen months of special classes at Franklin under the auspices of the Veterans Accelerated Program. In 1947, there were 1,800 veterans in classes, and graduates had enrolled in over 200 colleges and universities, including Harvard. During the McCarthy era, Francis P. Jennings, President of the Philadelphia Teachers Union and a social studies teacher at Franklin, was suspended for alleged communist activity. Testifying before the House Un-American Activities Committee, he declared that teachers were required to sacrifice constitutional rights to qualify for employment. Conservative economist and columnist Walter E. Williams, who graduated in 1954, was a critic of Franklin, but praised English teacher, Dr. Martin Rosenberg. Wesley Cook, although he never graduated, was a student at Franklin. In 1969, as a fourteen-year-old, he was inspired by a Black Panther Party newspaper to become involved in that movement and was one of those who proposed changing the school's name to honor Malcolm X. Subsequently, at the suggestion of a Kenyan teacher of African studies at Franklin, he adopted a \\"class\\" African name, Mumia, to which, following the birth of a son, he later added Abu-Jamal. As Mumia Abu-Jamal, he was convicted of murdering a police officer and while in prison became well-known as an author. Over a period of many years, Franklin athletes have had successful careers. George Nock, Wendell Tucker, and J. T. Turner played for the National Football League, and Fred Carter, Paul Graham, Pooh Richardson, and Randy Woods played for the National Basketball Association. Bryant Jennings is a heavyweight championship boxer. In September 1979 the school opened up to the first 9th graders and females. The class of 1979‚Äì1980 graduated its first and only female, Iris Chase, who wore a white and red robe instead of a blue and gold one. Franklin was one of the first high schools in Philadelphia serving the African American community. By the late 1980s the school had become run down and plagued with violence. Conditions at Franklin worsened when the School District of Philadelphia cut the school's funding due to many economic problems in the area. Dropouts and transfers were common. There were 164 freshmen enrolled in 1986, and another 71 entered the following fall, but only 181 graduated in 1990, a loss of 22 percent. In 2007, a $4 million renovation was made. The renovations included the gymnasium, auditorium and classrooms, and front entrance facade, as well as the replacement of doors and windows. In order to create new classroom space, a small rooftop building addition was constructed, with the addition of new steel dunnage and air handling units.http://pzsarchitects.com/pdfs/PZS-Architects-Education-Benjamin- Franklin-High-School.pdf In 2011, James Brunson Lauren Murphy-Sands and Larry Conlan started a rugby team.

The film stars George Sanders as Simon Templar, a.k.a. \\"The Saint\\", a master criminal turned crime-fighter, and features horror film legend Bela Lugosi as \\"The Partner\\". This was the fourth of eight films in RKO's film series about the character created by Leslie Charteris, and the first film to not be directly based upon one of the original Saint books, although Charteris did contribute to developing the story for the film. In this production, Sanders plays a dual role, not only that of Templar but of his doppelg√§nger, Duke Bates. When Bates is spotted smuggling diamonds into the US, Templar is blamed for the crime. Co-starring in the film is Helene Whitney as love interest Anne Bitts, and Jonathan Hale as Insp. Henry Farnack. Plot summary An authentic mummy is packaged and shipped from Cairo to Professor Horatio Bitts in Philadelphia. The package is sent under the name Simon Templar, but the sender is a man called The Partner, who is a member of an international team of jewel thieves, led by Boss Duke Bates. Meanwhile, John Bohlen of the Philadelphia Police Department is visited by Inspector Henry Fernack from New York. Private detective Simon Templar himself, more known as \\"The Saint\\", comes to visit his old friend Professor Bitts, and later in the night, the police are called to the professor's home to investigate a homicide. Fernack and Bohlen arrive at the crime scene and suspect Simon Templar of the killing, since he was the last one to visit the professor, and one of Templar's calling cards is found on the dead body. Knowing he is a suspect, Templar has to stay away from the police, but he still visits Inspector Fernack at his hotel late at night. Fernack tells Templar that he personally doesn't suspect him. Templar goes back to the crime scene, talks to Anne, daughter of the professor and has a closer look at the mummy. Templar has no idea that Boss Duke Bates is the spitting image of Templar, and poses as the famous private detective now and then. When Boss kills another man, one of his fences, Templar manages to find his hideout at the 4 Bells Caf√© and finds out about his doppelganger. After Boss finds out that one of the jewel packages is still inside the mummy, he goes back to the professor's house, but the professor crosses his path and is murdered by Boss. Templar sends a message to the police and Anne, alerting them of Boss' existence and of the caf√©. Boss tries to kill Anne but Templar arrives just in time to save her life. Then he goes back to the 4 Bells Caf√©, but is caught by Boss and his henchmen, bound and gagged. Boss plans to kill him and transports him to a boat nearby to get rid of the body afterwards. Before Boss has time to kill Templar, the police arrive and arrest Boss, presuming he is Templar. When they have gone, Templar manages to free himself and escape from the boat. He dresses up as a woman to get into the jail where Boss is held, and when they meet again, Boss knocks him down and steals his disguise in order to escape. This is something Templar has counted on, and when Boss tries to flee the jail, the police shoot him down and kill him. Fernack realizes that Boss was Templar's double and lets him run after he has returned the stolen jewels he found in the mummy.

Hence, the selection of A‚ÄìE contractors is focused on qualifications, and not the lowest price. ACASS supports procedures defined in Part 36 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). As envisioned, ACASS collected and distributed information used by Federal Government Selection committees in the process of awarding A‚ÄìE contracts. This information included the SF 330 part II A-E Qualifications Statement submitted by A-E firms to the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA), limited DoD Contract Award information, and A-E Performance Evaluations.

The city's high schools were filled to capacity at the time, and the population in southeast Portland was rapidly growing. It was initially founded in part of the Creston elementary school, with nine instructors and 115 student in the spring 1914 semester. The current brick building, designed by Floyd Naramore, opened in September 1917. In 1942, a statue of Benjamin Franklin, after whom the school was named, was installed outside of Franklin High School. Due to the baby boom and the passing of a $25 million building levy by the school district in 1947, a new addition for arts, industrial arts, and home economics departments was slated. In October 2010 the school decided to discontinue its competitive robotics team due to the lack of any school official sanctioning the team, allegedly by locking the team out of their workspace without access to their tools, or the more than $7000 the team had raised to sustain the program. The team had been a part of the school for seven years.http://www.thebeenews.com/news/story.php?story_id=129022143848652900 Between 2015 and 2017, the school was modernized and expanded, with funding from a $482 million bond measure in 2012. The modernization included a new arts center, a new gym, biomedical, and culinary arts building, seismic retrofitting, and a new entrance. Student profile In the 2017‚Äì2018 school year, Franklin's student population was 48.9% White, 20.5% Hispanic, 16.4% Asian, 5.6% African American, 0.6% Pacific Islander, 0.6% Native American, and 7.4% mixed race. In 2008, 80% of the school's seniors received a high school diploma. Of 354 students, 282 graduated, 52 dropped out, five received a modified diploma, and 15 were still in high school the following year. In 2009, 31% of the students were transfers into the school.

S. Gilbert in three acts based on the Pygmalion story. It opened at the Haymarket Theatre in London on 9 December 1871 and ran for a very successful 184 performances.Moss, Simon. \\"Pygmalion and Galatea\\" at Gilbert & Sullivan: a selling exhibition of memorabilia, c20th.com, accessed 16 November 2009 It was revived many times, including an 1883 production in New York starring Mary Anderson as Galatea, an 1883‚Äì84 revival at the Lyceum Theatre, again with Anderson, and an 1888 production at the Lyceum Theatre, with Julia Neilson as Cynisca. Pygmalion was Gilbert's greatest success to that date and is said to have earned him ¬£40,000 during his lifetime. Pygmalion and Galatea was so popular that other Pygmalions were rushed to the stage. In January 1872, Ganymede and Galatea opened at the Gaiety Theatre. This was a comic version of Franz von Supp√©'s Die sch√∂ne Galathee, coincidentally with Arthur Sullivan's brother, Fred Sullivan, in the cast. In March 1872, William Brough's Pygmalion; or, The Statue Fair was revived, and in May of that year, a visiting French company produced Victor Mass√©'s Galath√©e. Gilbert created several blank verse \\"fairy comedies\\" at the Haymarket Theatre for John Baldwin Buckstone and starring William Hunter Kendal and his wife Madge Robertson Kendal (sister of the playwright Tom Robertson), in the early 1870s. These plays, influenced by the fairy work of James Planch√©, are founded upon the idea of self-revelation by characters under the influence of some magic or some supernatural interference.The Cambridge History of English and American Literature in 18 Volumes (1907‚Äì21). Volume XIII. \\"The Victorian Age\\", Part One. VIII. Nineteenth-Century Drama, ¬ß 15. W. S. Gilbert The first was The Palace of Truth in 1870, a fantasy adapted from a story by Madame de Genlis. Pygmalion and Galatea, a satire of sentimental, romantic attitudes toward myth, was one of seven plays that Gilbert produced in 1871. Together, these plays, and successors such as The Wicked World (1873), Sweethearts (1874), Charity (1874), and Broken Hearts (1875), did for Gilbert on the dramatic stage what the German Reed Entertainments had done for him on the musical stage. They established that his capabilities extended far beyond burlesque and won him artistic credentials as a writer of wide range, who was as comfortable with human drama as with farcical humour.Stedman, chapter 8 Synopsis W. S. Gilbert in about 1870 In Gilbert's Pygmalion story, the sculptor is a married man. He sculpts many copies in the image of wife, Cynisca. His wife at first encourages his interest in one of these statues, Galatea. Cynisca is often away, and she doesn't want her husband to be bored. When the statue comes to life, however, matters become complex, as she falls in love with her creator. Galatea is born so innocent that she appears wayward and disrupts the lives she touches during her one day in the flesh. Under the fire of Cynisca's jealousy, and seeing the difficulty in which she has placed Pygmalion, Galatea decides that her original state was happier, and turns back into a statue.

That he occasionally degrades high and beautiful themes is not surprising. To do so had been the regular proceeding in burlesque, and the age almost expected it; but Gilbert's is not the then usual hearty cockney vulgarity. In Pygmalion and Galatea, and, still more, in Gretchen (1879)... the vulgarity is cynical and bitter. A New York Times review of a production of the play at the Fifth Avenue Theatre in New York City said, :Mr. Gilbert, who is inevitably a humorist, has, one must own, put a great deal of truth and humanity into his Pygmalion and Galatea. The play is, from one side, harshly and aggressively disagreeable. Its characters are low, vulgar, and selfish. Pygmalion ‚Äì an antique poetic conception ‚Äì is reduced here to snobbishness and priggishness. His sister, his wife, his kinsmen, and his friends are insufferable. But, though insufferable, they are not especially untruthful. Those who try to portray life are brought to the sad work of picturing absurd, weak and sordid personalities. Men, as we know them, are not ideals. They are rather caricatures of ideals. Mr. Gilbert, who has bright satiric force, does not hesitate to put his sting into them ‚Äì and his purpose is admirably praiseworthy. In several of his plays he is laboured and fantastic; in Pygmalion and Galatea, it seems to us, he presents the pathos of idealism in a very effective manner, contrasting it grimly and cynically with frank reality. Galatea is the spirit of sweet, ingenuous, aspiring womanhood; she is ushered into a world of bitterness, jealousy, vulgarity; she loves her maker, who is a narrow-hearted and fatuous sculptor; she meets those who prove to her that life is a thing of sorrow. At the end, forlorn and broken in soul, she returns to her pedestal, utters her melancholy farewell to the world, and becomes again a statue. The satire in a play like this is, of course, rather darkly drawn. The contrast between the innocent Galatea and the selfish Pygmalion is painful, mournful. But is the contrast, is the satire, under-true? There is nothing so beautiful, so bewildering, as the potency of life. It is astonishing, a posteriori, that life is as small, as unsatisfactory, as it is. Pygmalion and Galatea has, in consequence, a depth which it may not appear to have at first sight. It is a trifle on the surface ‚Äì a jest aimed at our dull human affairs. But the plot has a barbed point.1883 NY Times review In 2012, biologist Fred Sander used the play \\"as a 'hook' to explore the ethics and science of cloning\\" in his book Created In Our Own Images.com.Shepherd, Marc. \\"Created In Our Own Images.com\\", Oakapple Press, 8 August 2011, accessed 20 November 2013 Sander wrote: \\"Gilbert‚Äôs drama not only anticipates psychoanalysis in the 20th century, but also, written a hundred years before the discovery of stem cells, it metaphorically resonates with the 21st century of genomic medicine. ...

After establishing her reputation in a series of plays by W. S. Gilbert in 1888, Neilson joined the company of Herbert Beerbohm Tree, where she remained for five years, meeting her future husband, Fred Terry (brother to actresses Kate, Ellen, Marion and Florence Terry and great uncle of John Gielgud). With Terry, she played in London and on tour for nearly three decades. She was the mother of the actress Phyllis Neilson-Terry and actor Dennis Neilson-Terry. Life and career Neilson was born in London, the only child of Alexander Ritchie Neilson, a jeweller, and his wife, Emilie Davis, a member of a family of five Jewish sisters, many of whose offspring became actresses. Neilson's parents divorced shortly after her birth, and her father soon died, leaving her mother to struggle to support her child. Her mother much later married a solicitor, William Morris, the widower of the actress Florence Terry, elder sister of the actor Fred Terry, who had, by that time, married Neilson.Roy, Donald. \\"Neilson, Julia Emilie (1868‚Äì1957)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 7 January 2010 Neilson was an indifferent student. At the age of twelve, she was sent to a boarding school in Wiesbaden, Germany, where she learned to speak French and German and began to study music, discovering that she excelled at this. She returned to England to enter the Royal Academy of Music in 1884, at the age of fifteen, to study piano. She soon discovered that she had a talent as a singer, winning the Llewellyn Thomas Gold Medal (1885), the Westmoreland Scholarship (1886) and the Sainton Dolby Prize (1886). While at the Academy, in 1887, she sang at the St James's Hall and also played roles in amateur theatre. Early stage career The Era Almanack, 1894 Neilson met the dramatist W. S. Gilbert, who cast her in her first professional stage appearance in March 1888. She played Cynisca in a charity matin√©e of his play, Pygmalion and Galatea, at the Lyceum Theatre, and later that year, in the same play, she was the lead character, Galatea, in a similar matin√©e at the Savoy Theatre. Gilbert suggested that the statuesque young woman concentrate her career on acting rather than singing, and he coached her on acting. Her next role was Lady Hilda in a revival of Gilbert's Broken Hearts. Gilbert wrote the lyrics to a short song for her to sing during Act I, and she proposed that a fellow student of hers at the Royal Academy, Edward German, should set it to music. She then played Selene in a revival of Gilbert's The Wicked World. In November 1888, she created the role of Ruth Redmayne in Rutland Barrington's production of Gilbert's Brantinghame Hall. These roles led to an invitation for Neilson to join Herbert Beerbohm Tree's company, in which she toured in Captain Swift, The Red Lamp and The Merry Wives of Windsor. She remained with Tree's company for five years at the Haymarket Theatre as a tragedienne, beginning with the role of Julie de Noirville in A Man's Shadow, which opened in September 1889. In 1891, Neilson married another actor in the company, Fred Terry, the brother of Gilbert's former prot√©g√©e, Marion Terry (and the actresses Kate, Ellen and Florence Terry). Neilson and her husband appeared together in Sydney Grundy's translation of the French play A Village Priest and numerous other productions together with Tree's company, including Beau Austin, Hamlet, Peril and Gilbert's Comedy and Tragedy (1890). She also played Drusilla Ives in The Dancing Girl (1891) by Henry Arthur Jones, and Terry and Neilson's daughter Phyllis was born in 1892. Neilson was soon back on stage as Lady Isobel in Jones's The Tempter (1893),Beerbohm Tree's New Play; The Tempter, The New York Times, 21 September 1893, p. 4 and created the role of Hester Worsley in Oscar Wilde's A Woman of No Importance (1893). A review of Neilson's performance in the play Ballad Monger in 1890 declared: Postcard photo, 1890s :Miss Neilson's really wonderful singing took the curtain up on the very keynote of the beautiful and pathetic play. And to her singing no higher tribute can be paid. One of these days, we do not doubt, it will be possible to write in the same strain about her acting. In that there is splendid promise. And the promise will come the more near to performance when she is a trifle less conscious of her remarkable physical beauty, and of the fact that she has been to some extent rushed into her present position.Nelson, Alec (pseudonym of Edward Aveling). \\"Eleanor Marx and Edward Aveling 1890\\", www.marxists.org, Eleanor Marx Archive, accessed 7 January 2009 In June 1894, Neilson and Terry appeared together in Shall We Forgive Her? by Frank Harvey at the Adelphi Theatre, with Neilson as Grace. The next year, she played Lady Chiltern in Wilde's comedy An Ideal Husband at the Haymarket under the management of Lewis Waller. She gave birth to her second child, Dennis, in October 1895. Two months later, the family travelled to America to perform with John Hare's company. There they played together in New York in The Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith by Arthur Wing Pinero, with Neilson as Agnes. In 1896, they returned to England where, at the St James's Theatre, Neilson played Princess Flavia in The Prisoner of Zenda by Anthony Hope, remaining at that theatre for two years. There she played Rosalind in the extremely successful run of As You Like It (in which role she toured North America in 1895 and 1910). She played the title role in Pinero's The Princess and the Butterfly in 1897.Fyfe, Hamilton.

It is native to shallow tropical waters of the western Indo- Pacific, living at depths down to 70 m, and being associated with coral reefs. It grows up to 17 cm in length and forms large schools. It is an important commercial fish, and is eaten dried, salted, boiled, or made into fish balls.  Reproduction  S. gibbosa have unique eggs because they do not possess a wide perivitelline space (an important aspect to sardinella eggs and most pelagic fish). Some scientists do not consider this species a true member of the Sardinella genus for this reason. The spawning season for these fish ranges from April to October. In this species there is a trend of smaller fish spawning earlier in the spawning season. Peak spawning occurs in June and July and this is followed by the older larger specimens which tend to move into the spawning areas later in the season  Age determination  The determination of age in this species has proved difficult because there are small rings present on the scales called annuli. However, it is very difficult to determine their true cause. These annuli are often interrupted or indented in the patterns on the scales (striae) are often interrupted or indented. The spaces between striae are often lighter in color especially in comparison to the rest of the striated region of the scale. In comparison, salmon and trout form much more distinct annuli according to rings forming closer to one another during different seasons of the year. In essence, the debate is whether these annuli are spawning rings or whether they develop as a result of some unknown cause and unknown time frame. This information is ineffective as a measure of the age of the fish until these issues are cleared and definitive.  Commercial production  Dried Sardinella gibbosa is a favorite especially in Korean markets. These fish are advertised as dried herring in Korea, England, Sweden and Canada. The process by which Vietnamese Gold Stripe Sardinella are made available includes being washed, steamed, sun dried, packed and preserved. These fish are important in fisheries in parts of India and throughout Southeast Asia.  Distinguishing features  Sardinella gibbosa have a relatively slender body, and a below average number of gill rakers. They have unique, small perforations on the hind part of their scales along with a dark spot on the dorsal fin. The distribution of S. gibbosa includes the Indo-West Pacific, East African coast, and a range from Madagascar to Indonesia. S. gibbosa are one of the most abundant Sardinella in Indo West Pacific, and off the coast of Taiwan, Korea and Australia. Fisheries are most prominent in southern parts of India, with markets throughout Southeast Asia It has been found in the eastern Mediterranean off the coast of Israel having invaded through the Suez Canal as a lessepsian migrant from the Red Sea.

Later until August of 1957 he was playing as a forward for Khimik Kalush in competitions among KFK of the Ukrainian SSR. From September of 1957 to May of 1959 Sabo played in Class B (second tier) for Spartak Uzhhorod. Sabo made his name as a player at Dynamo Kyiv, appearing at the club from June of 1959 to 1969. A four-time Soviet Top League champion, Sabo appeared in 317 games in the competition, scoring 51 goals. His first game he played in a friendly against Tottenham Hotspur F.C. on 1 June 1959. In July of 1963 Sabo was disqualified for a year for a rough play, but in February of 1964 it was changed to a conditional disqualification. Also in 1968 he was disqualified again for refusing to play for the Soviet national football team. Sabo was a member of Dynamo Kyiv when the club in 1961 for the first time gained the Soviet title, breaking the Muscovite spell. To the Kyiv's team he arrived along with two other Uzhhorod players Andriy Havasi and Vasyl Turianchyk. International Aside from being named one of the 33 best players in the USSR for five years, Sabo capped 76 times for the USSR national side, scoring 16 goals. He played in 41 official matches and 35 friendlies. Sabo made his international debut in away game against Greece on 3 October 1965 (see 1966 FIFA World Cup qualification ‚Äì UEFA Group 7). Sabo mentioned that the game took place after in Greece took place the Apostasia of 1965 (Royal Coup). While his official first appearance for the Soviet team was in 1965, Sabo was on the 1962 Soviet team roster for the 1962 FIFA World Cup. Coaching career However, Sabo became most famous for his coaching, coaching various sides in the late 70s (such as Zorya Luhansk in 1977 and Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk in 1978‚Äì1979), he has coached Dynamo Kyiv numerous times (from 1993‚Äì1997 and 2004‚Äì2005, with breaks in between). He is also arguably the second-most successful coach of the Ukrainian national team, compiling 16 wins and 12 draws in 34 matches as coach of the side in 1994 and 1996‚Äì1999. On 20 September 2007 he was appointed as Dynamo Kyiv's manager after Anatoliy Demyanenko resigned. However, Sabo resigned in early November that year due to personal health problems. He left Dynamo Kyiv by the end of 2007 and has no longer been involved with the club since that time. Personal life Sabo was born in a leap year on 29 February.

He also mentioned that in Moscow he was called fascist, because there knew that his father served in the Royal Hungarian Army during the World War II and later for that he was exiled to Siberia. Russian language Sabo started to learn after arriving to Kyiv and with a help of a tutor. Sabo was offered to join Komsomol and Communist Party, but declined explaining that he cannot be communist and stay religious. Even after arriving to Kyiv he continued to attend an underground Greek-Catholic services that were taken place in Sviatoshyn. Sabo said that he became the only Ukrainian who received the medal from the 1966 FIFA World Cup, while at same time Valeriy Porkujan who also played at the mundial was left without it. When the Soviets beat Hungary in quarterfinals, Sabo was forced to hear all kinds of sentiments from his former compatriots. Sabo also explained that the reason why he refused to travel to Hungary with the Soviet national team for the quarter-final game was that he tried to finish his journalist degree in Kyiv University. The Soviet team then qualified and without Sabo, but he was disqualified. In 1970 after a short stint in Luhansk, Sabo for couple of months worked as a sports correspondent of Ukrainian newspaper \\"Pravda Ukrainy\\".

Making extensive use of flashbacks, it tells the story of how the Judges of Mega-City One rose to power. It was written by John Wagner and illustrated by Carlos Ezquerra, who between them created Judge Dredd in 1977. The story ran to 23 episodes and was published from 2006 to 2007 to mark thirty years of the Judge Dredd strip. It is set in 2129, Dredd's debut story having been set in 2099. Wagner explained: 2000 AD editor Matt Smith has expanded on this to touch on the contents: Publication history \\"Origins\\" was preceded by a five-episode story called \\"The Connection\\", written by John Wagner and drawn by Kev Walker. It appeared in progs (issues) 1500-1504 and was immediately followed by \\"Origins\\" in progs 1505-1519 and 1529‚Äì1535. It had been intended that the final episode would appear in the comic's celebratory thirtieth anniversary issue, but publication was interrupted because artist Carlos Ezquerra moved house during his work on the story. The editor decided to permit him time to finish the strip himself rather than replace him with another artist. Plot summary=\\"The Connection\\" The prologue story introduces a team of mutants from the radioactive Cursed Earth desert outside Mega-City One, who infiltrate the city. Working for an unseen character called Linus, their task is to deliver a small box to the Grand Hall of Justice in the centre of the city. They are all killed by Judge Dredd while accomplishing this task, but Dredd fails to retrieve the box. The contents of the box are not revealed until the first episode of \\"Origins.\\" Meanwhile, Dredd, between his efforts to catch the mutants, has recurring dreams about his clone father, Chief Judge Fargo, and his brother, Rico Dredd (both long deceased). The dreams hint about the epic story to follow. \\"Origins\\"Premise= The box is delivered to Chief Judge Hershey, who informs Dredd that it contains a ransom note and a sample of living tissue which matches the DNA of Judge Fargo, the first chief judge and the revered founder of the Judge System. (Forensic tests establish that toxins in the tissue show that the source lived through the last century, and so the sample must be Fargo's rather than Dredd's.) The note requires payment of a billion credits in exchange for Fargo's body. As required by the terms of the exchange, Dredd leads a small, lightly armed party on a mission across the hostile Cursed Earth to retrieve their esteemed \\"Father of Justice.\\" Since Fargo was believed to have died in the year 2051, and the mission takes place in 2129, much of the story consists of Dredd explaining to the members of his team how it is that Fargo might still be alive - a secret history which was concealed from the public for decades. =Flashbacks= Chief Judge Fargo (painted by Carlos Ezquerra) The middle chapters of \\"Origins\\" cover Fargo's life history, and how he founded his Judge System in 2031. After serving twenty years as chief judge, however, Fargo succumbed to a moment of weakness and had an illicit affair with a female colleague, something strictly forbidden by the Judges' code of celibacy. Unable to cope with his own lapse in the exacting moral standards he had inflexibly demanded of his subordinates, Fargo tendered his resignation to the President of the United States. Spurning the entreaties of his two deputies, Judge Solomon and Judge Goodman, and of President Pierce, to reconsider his decision and resume his office, Fargo instead chose to commit suicide. However his attempt to take his own life failed, leaving him with significant brain-damage and without the use of his legs. Fearing that their political enemies would use the scandalous circumstances of Fargo's resignation and injuries to destroy Fargo's legacy, Solomon and Goodman covered them up. Using sophisticated video technology, they faked footage of Fargo bravely sacrificing his life in the line of duty, gunned down in a brutal drive-by shooting. This enabled them to present Fargo as a martyr, increasing public support for the Judges.Chief Judge Solomon (painted by Carlos Ezquerra) This deception had been conceived while Fargo's doctors had predicted that he would not long survive. However Fargo defied their expectations and began to slowly recover. He was therefore kept in a secret medical facility, isolated from the world so that the cover-up would not be discovered. When his condition began to deteriorate again, Chief Judge Solomon had him cryogenically frozen in suspended animation until such time as medical science could cure him. By 2070 President Robert Linus Booth was in the White House, having illegally rigged the voting computers to win the 2068 presidential election, and murdered one of his aides who threatened to expose the fraud. Booth pursued an aggressive foreign policy, openly stating that he would begin a nuclear war if the rest of the world did not comply with his demands. The Judges - now led by Chief Judge Goodman - attempted to dissuade him, but to no avail, and the Third World War laid waste to most of the world. Booth had believed that his new \\"nuclear screens\\" would protect America from retaliation, but only Mega-City One on the east coast, Mega-City Two on the west coast, and Texas City survived. The rest of America was virtually annihilated, creating the Cursed Earth which became populated by mutants and outlaws. Chief Judge Goodman (painted by Carlos Ezquerra) Consequently, another of Booth's aides turned against him and provided Goodman with evidence of Booth's earlier crimes. Goodman made the evidence public, and public opinion turned against Booth. A demonstration outside the White House became a massacre when troops opened fire on the crowd. But the evidence of election fraud was not conclusive, and impeachment proceedings against Booth were too slow for Goodman to protect his position, for Booth had discovered that Fargo was alive and had been revived from suspended animation. Booth sent troops to arrest Fargo, intending to expose the myth of his death and thereby destroy the Judges' reputation for integrity. Joe and Rico Dredd, cadets at the time, managed to rescue Fargo from capture. However Goodman realised that urgent action was needed to defeat Booth, and the constitutional mechanism for trying him and removing him from office could not be completed in time. On Fargo's advice, Goodman deposed Booth, suspended Congress, and usurped the government of the United States. For his crimes Booth was sentenced to 100 years in suspended animation, to let posterity decide his ultimate fate. Goodman became dictator of the United States (which soon split into three sovereign city- states), with Fargo - his existence still a secret - advising him from behind the scenes. However Fargo soon deteriorated again. He also became demoralised, having intended that the overthrow of democratic government should be temporary, and regretting his own part in establishing a lasting dictatorship. Shortly after surviving an assassination attempt by renegade judge Morton Judd, Fargo was returned to suspended animation once more. However, only one month later Fargo's body was stolen by Judd's agents. When Judd was eventually brought to justice and Fargo's body was still not recovered, it was thought lost forever. =Conclusion= Thirty years later Booth's cryogenic machinery failed, and he was inadvertently revived. Judge Dredd resentenced him to life working on a farm in the Cursed Earth, to make amends for the destruction he unleashed on America. (This was first portrayed in the 1978 story \\"The Cursed Earth\\".) Instead however Booth raised an army of mutants, the \\"New Mutant Army,\\" who he intended to use to overthrow the Judges and become president again. By 2129 he had discovered Fargo's stolen cryogenic unit, which had been lost in the Cursed Earth when Judd's agents' hovership crashed. When Dredd attempted to exchange the ransom for Fargo, Booth double- crossed him and put him on trial for treason, intending to execute him. However Dredd had anticipated this and planned a timely rescue by his comrades. Taken hostage for use as a human shield, Booth was killed by his own side during the ensuing battle. Back in Mega-City One, Fargo was revived again, but this time he did not survive. His final words were spoken to Dredd alone: \\"We created a monster ... we're the monster!\\" He told Dredd that the Judges had gone too far and had destroyed America, and urged Dredd to do everything he could to undo it. Dredd's reaction to this plea was not shown, but when Chief Judge Hershey asked him what Fargo's last words had been, Dredd lied and pretended that Fargo had said something else less controversial. Fans speculated at the time that this indicated that this theme may be followed up in later stories. This speculation was soon proved correct. Epilogue \\"Origins\\" was soon followed up in a series of stories, starting with \\"Mutants in Mega-City One\\",2000 AD progs 1542-1545 written by John Wagner. In the first episode Dredd admitted to Hershey that he had lied about Fargo's last words. Hershey in turn admitted that Fargo had said the same thing to her, and that she had told the same lie to Dredd. However whereas Dredd took Fargo's warning seriously, Hershey dismissed it as the ravings of a brain-damaged invalid, adding that she hoped Dredd would not consider resigning over their differences. This story also featured the return of some of the mutant Fargo Clan (who were first seen, briefly, in \\"Origins\\") - mutant descendants of Fargo, and therefore Dredd's relatives. In this story, Dredd put forward a motion to repeal the anti-mutant laws, beginning a new story arc about mutants. Supporting characters \\"Origins\\" introduced some new characters, Dredd's cousin Randy Fargo and his family, a clan of mutants living in the Cursed Earth, who returned to the strip in the sequel \\"Mutants in Mega-City One.\\" In addition to the judges who appeared in the flashback episodes described above, the following characters appeared in the story in the \\"present day\\" of 2129, as members of Dredd's team: *Judge Logan *Judge Renga *Judge Sanchez Collected editions Both stories were released as a trade paperback in 2007, with a cover by Brian Bolland (),Judge Dredd: Origins, Rebellion, and in a volume in the series \\"Judge Dredd: The Mega Collection\\" by Hachette Partworks in 2015.

Early life and education Beynon was born 1888 in Victoria, British Columbia, son of a Tsimshian woman of Nisga'a ancestry and \\"Captain Billy\\" Beynon, a Welsh steamboat captain. Although some sources describe Beynon as being Nisga'a or matrilineally Nisga'a, his ancestry was more complicated. Beynon's maternal line descends from members of the Laxgibuu (Wolf clan) of the Nisga'a nation. But members of his line moved from the Nass River to Port Simpson, British Columbia, the largest Canadian Tsimshian community, to fill a power vacuum when nearly the entirety of the Gitlaan tribe (one of Lax Kw'alaams's \\"Nine Tribes\\") migrated in 1887 to Metlakatla, Alaska. Beynon's maternal grandfather was Arthur Wellington Clah, a hereditary Tsimshian chief and a Hudson's Bay Company employee. William Beynon was the only one of six brothers to be raised fluent in the Tsimshian language. When his mother's only surviving brother, Albert Wellington, died in 1913, William Beynon moved from Victoria to Port Simpson at the age of 25 to assume his uncle's hereditary title, Gwisk'aayn. This was in accordance with Tsimshian rules of matrilineal succession, and he served as hereditary chief of the Gitlaan tribe until his own death. Career Beginning in 1914, Beynon was hired as a translator and transcriber by the anthropologist Marius Barbeau, then in the employ of the Geological Survey of Canada. Barbeau and Beynon's series of interviews with Lax Kw'alaams chiefs and elders in 1914-15 has been called by the anthropologist Wilson Duff \\"one of the most productive field seasons in the history of [North] American anthropology.\\" In 1916 Beynon continued the same type of work, on his own, with the Tsimshian of Kitkatla, B.C. This field trip was marred by a measles epidemic among the people, causing high mortality. In addition, Benyon was shipwrecked for ten days on an uninhabited island with Chief Seeks of the Kitkatla tribe. As Beynon increased his facility with phonetic transcription and knowledge of his own people's traditions‚Äîwhich, as a formerly assimilated urbanite, he was quickly learning‚Äîhe began to work more and more under his own direction. In the 1920s he worked with Barbeau with elders from the Kitsumkalum and Kitselas Tsimshian and the Gitksan nation, in and around Terrace, British Columbia. From 1918 to 1924, Beynon worked extensively up and down the coast, collecting museum artifacts for Sir Henry Wellcome, executor of the estate of William Duncan, the missionary founder of Metlakatla, Alaska. Beynon spent considerable time there as Wellcome's local representative. From 1929 until 1956, when Beynon became ill, he continued to send Barbeau his own fieldnotes, covering every conceivable aspect of the culture and traditions of the Tsimshian, Gitksan, and Nisga'a peoples. He carefully recorded oral narratives. His tour de force was a 200-page description of a four-day potlatch and totem-pole-raising feast in 1945 in the Gitksan village of Gitsegukla. This has recently been issued in book form. Wilson Duff has ranked the resulting thousands of pages of Barbeau- Beynon fieldnotes, now housed at the Canadian Museum of Civilization, as \\"the most complete body of information on the social organization of any Indian nation\\". In 1931, Beynon was one of the four founding members of the Native Brotherhood of British Columbia, an indigenous-rights organization founded in Port Simpson. From 1932 to 1939 Beynon sent the anthropologist Franz Boas approximately 250 transcribed narratives. These are now known as the \\"Beynon Manuscripts,\\" and are housed by the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia. In the early 1930s Beynon facilitated the immensely productive Port Simpson fieldwork of Viola Garfield, a doctoral student of Boas. Many pages of Garfield's voluminous field notebooks are filled out in Beynon's handwriting. Their work was the basis of Garfield's PhD dissertation and first book. In 1953 Beynon worked with the anthropologist Philip Drucker, of the Smithsonian Institution. For Drucker, Beynon wrote his own, as yet unpublished, synthesis of the complex lineage histories of the Tsimshianic- speaking peoples. Beynon died in 1958 in Prince Rupert, B.C. He had spent most of his life earning a living in the canning and fishing industries, like many of his people. But he made as large and valuable a contribution to Northwest Coast ethnology as any professional anthropologist. His published and unpublished works continue to be an invaluable resource for the Tsimshian, Gitksan, and Nisga'a peoples. Works *Anderson, Margaret Seguin, and Marjorie Halpin (eds.)

A solution for the Diabolical Cube puzzle - swapping the 2-cube (red) and 4-cube (yellow) blocks gives another The diabolical cube is a three-dimensional dissection puzzle consisting of six polycubes (shapes formed by gluing cubes together face to face) that can be assembled together to form a single 3 √ó 3 √ó 3 cube.. The six pieces are: one dicube, one tricube, one tetracube, one pentacube, one hexacube and one heptacube, that is, polycubes of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 cubes. There are many similar variations of this type of puzzle, including the Soma cube and the Slothouber‚ÄìGraatsma puzzle, two other dissections of a 3 √ó 3 √ó 3 cube into polycubes which use seven and nine pieces respectively. However, writes that the diabolical cube appears to be the oldest puzzle of this type, first appearing in an 1893 book Puzzles Old and New by Professor Hoffmann (Angelo Lewis). Because all of the pieces have only a single layer of cubes, their shape is unchanged by a mirror reflection, so a mirror reflection of a solution produces either the same solution or another valid solution. The puzzle has 13 different solutions, if mirrored pairs of solutions are not counted as being distinct from each other.

Alternative derivations According to the definitions above, one should find out the Weyl tensors before calculating the Weyl-NP scalars via contractions with relevant tetrad vectors. This method, however, does not fully reflect the spirit of Newman‚ÄìPenrose formalism. As an alternative, one could firstly compute the spin coefficients and then use the NP field equations to derive the five Weyl-NP scalars :\\\\Psi_0=D\\\\sigma-\\\\delta\\\\kappa-(\\\\rho+\\\\bar{\\\\rho})\\\\sigma-(3\\\\varepsilon-\\\\bar{\\\\varepsilon})\\\\sigma+(\\\\tau-\\\\bar{\\\\pi}+\\\\bar{\\\\alpha}+3\\\\beta)\\\\kappa\\\\,, :\\\\Psi_1=D\\\\beta-\\\\delta\\\\varepsilon-(\\\\alpha+\\\\pi)\\\\sigma-(\\\\bar{\\\\rho}-\\\\bar{\\\\varepsilon})\\\\beta+(\\\\mu+\\\\gamma)\\\\kappa+(\\\\bar{\\\\alpha}-\\\\bar{\\\\pi})\\\\varepsilon\\\\,, :\\\\Psi_2=\\\\bar{\\\\delta}\\\\tau-\\\\Delta\\\\rho-(\\\\rho\\\\bar{\\\\mu}+\\\\sigma\\\\lambda)+(\\\\bar{\\\\beta}-\\\\alpha-\\\\bar{\\\\tau})\\\\tau+(\\\\gamma+\\\\bar{\\\\gamma})\\\\rho+ u\\\\kappa-2\\\\Lambda\\\\,, :\\\\Psi_3=\\\\bar{\\\\delta}\\\\gamma-\\\\Delta\\\\alpha+(\\\\rho+\\\\varepsilon) u-(\\\\tau+\\\\beta)\\\\lambda+(\\\\bar{\\\\gamma}-\\\\bar{\\\\mu})\\\\alpha+(\\\\bar{\\\\beta}-\\\\bar{\\\\tau})\\\\gamma\\\\,. :\\\\Psi_4=\\\\delta u-\\\\Delta\\\\lambda-(\\\\mu+\\\\bar{\\\\mu})\\\\lambda-(3\\\\gamma-\\\\bar{\\\\gamma})\\\\lambda+(3\\\\alpha+\\\\bar{\\\\beta}+\\\\pi-\\\\bar{\\\\tau}) u\\\\,. where \\\\Lambda (used for \\\\Psi_2) refers to the NP curvature scalar \\\\Lambda:=\\\\frac{R}{24} which could be calculated directly from the spacetime metric g_{ab}. Physical interpretation Szekeres (1965). gave an interpretation of the different Weyl scalars at large distances: :\\\\Psi_2 is a \\"Coulomb\\" term, representing the gravitational monopole of the source; :\\\\Psi_1 & \\\\Psi_3 are ingoing and outgoing \\"longitudinal\\" radiation terms; :\\\\Psi_0 & \\\\Psi_4 are ingoing and outgoing \\"transverse\\" radiation terms. For a general asymptotically flat spacetime containing radiation (Petrov Type I), \\\\Psi_1 & \\\\Psi_3 can be transformed to zero by an appropriate choice of null tetrad. Thus these can be viewed as gauge quantities. A particularly important case is the Weyl scalar \\\\Psi_4. It can be shown to describe outgoing gravitational radiation (in an asymptotically flat spacetime) as :\\\\Psi_4 = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left( \\\\ddot{h}_{\\\\hat{\\\\theta} \\\\hat{\\\\theta}} - \\\\ddot{h}_{\\\\hat{\\\\phi} \\\\hat{\\\\phi}} \\\\right) + i \\\\ddot{h}_{\\\\hat{\\\\theta}\\\\hat{\\\\phi}} = -\\\\ddot{h}_+ + i \\\\ddot{h}_\\\\times\\\\ . Here, h_+ and h_\\\\times are the \\"plus\\" and \\"cross\\" polarizations of gravitational radiation, and the double dots represent double time-differentiation. There are, however, certain examples in which the interpretation listed above fails. These are exact vacuum solutions of the Einstein field equations with cylindrical symmetry. For instance, a static (infinitely long) cylinder can produce a gravitational field which has not only the expected \\"Coulomb\\"-like Weyl component \\\\Psi_2, but also non-vanishing \\"transverse wave\\"-components \\\\Psi_0 and \\\\Psi_4. Furthermore, purely outgoing Einstein-Rosen waves have a non-zero \\"incoming transverse wave\\"-component \\\\Psi_0.
