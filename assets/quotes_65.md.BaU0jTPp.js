Later, many DJs found Exceeder to be a desirable track to dub lyrics onto, and created songs such as Technologic Exceeder, Fergalicious Exceeder, and Hollaback Exceeder. Another notable mix of this track appeared on some editions of the Ministry of Sound Maximum Bass 2007 compilation, credited as Exceeder/Girl Dem Shaker by Mason/Wideboys & MC JLC Remixes In 2010, remixes of Felguk, Tai and Mashtronic came out, via Zip MusicExceeder (Felguk & Tai Remixes) by Mason at Discogs.

It was founded by Harry Rosenfeld. His sons Aaron Ross and Norman Rosenfeld worked for the company and later took over management and ownership upon Harry's death in 1973. In 1932, the flagship store was moved to the corner of Woodward Avenue and Montcalm; by 1952, Sibley's moved its corporate offices to the Fox Building and remained there until 1977. Meanwhile, the Sibley's chain grew to more than 38 stores at its peak, throughout Michigan and into Ohio. These stores, primarily located in shopping malls, included both Sibley's and Ms. Sibley's, the latter of which was a specialty shoe store for women. Upon the construction of the Renaissance Center skyscraper complex in the mid-1970s, Sibley's later moved its offices there, until the complex was purchased by General Motors. Sibley's later chose a site in Warren, Michigan in 1997 and began construction on a new headquarters building and warehouse, completed in August 1998. In 2001, the company was sold to its two top executives, President and CEO Hansel Artrip and CFO/VP Andrew Belsky, and the headquarters were relocated again, this time to Grand Blanc, Michigan. After the chain's acquisition in the spring of 2001, store sales saw deep declines in 2002 and 2003. Efforts were made to develop diversification strategies to align product with younger demographics, as well as capitalize on the emerging web-based markets, but demand for their products as well as market headwinds eliminated the potential for a turn-around. The ownership group soon saw its line of credit revoked by way of Chase Bank's acquisition of Detroit-based Bank One, and mounting losses, made worse by the terrorist attacks of 9/11/2001 and the mysterious blackouts of August, 2003 forced the senior leadership team into panic mode as they teetered on the brink of insolvency. Artrip moved to negotiate a partnership with a financier to back continued operations, but in December 2003 it was determined that there was no way forward. After intense deliberation, and an unwillingness to restructure the embattled company, Artrip and Belsky announced their intent to close the last twenty-nine stores in late 2003, citing poor financial performance. The stores would close for good in April, 2004. The Sibley's Shoes name was subsequently purchased by Mr. Alan's for $25,000 References Companies based in Detroit Retail companies established in 1920 Defunct retail companies of the United States Shoe companies of the United States Defunct companies based in Michigan Retail companies disestablished in 2003 ","title":"Sibley's Shoes"},{"id":"9564473","text":"Rhyme and Reason is an American television game show that aired on ABC from July 7, 1975 through July 9, 1976. Bob Eubanks hosted the show, with Johnny Jacobs serving as announcer. William T. Naud created the series. Game play The show consisted of two contestants and a panel of six celebrities. The object of the game was to get the celebrity to say a word the contestant had written down. Before each round of play, the contestants were shown two sentences (e.g. \\"There once was a man/Who lived in a box\\"). Using an electronic pen, the contestants wrote down a word which rhymed with the last word in the second sentence (the home audience was shown the contestants' words, but the panelists were not). Once the words were written, contestants (alternating turns) called upon one celebrity to devise a second part of the poem, hoping the last word the celebrity used would match the contestant's; doing so earned that contestant two points. If the celebrity guessed the opponent's word, the opponent received one point. If the celebrity said neither word, his/her opponent chose another celebrity. Play continued on a poem if necessary until all six celebrities had attempted to match; if all failed, Eubanks introduced a new poem. If both contestants used the same word, only the contestant who chose the celebrity who ultimately used the word scored two points. The first contestant to score three points won the game and $250. The first contestant to win two games played for $5,000. Bonus round The winning contestant and a celebrity partner of his or her choice played for $5,000. Two lines were again shown to the contestant, who then wrote three rhyming words. The contestant and celebrity then had thirty seconds to match all three words. The clock began once the lines were first read to the celebrity, who then provided a rhyme for the last word in the line. The process repeated for the entire thirty seconds or until the celebrity matched all three words. Matching on each word won the contestant $1,000, and matching all three awarded the $5,000 grand prize. Champions retired after playing five bonus rounds or reaching the $20,000 winnings limit. Broadcast history Rhyme marked Eubanks' return to daytime television, six months after ABC cancelled The Newlywed Game. Regulars on the show were Nipsey Russell and (husband and wife) Charlie Brill and Mitzi McCall. Some critics consider the series to have been expressly designed for Russell's talents as \\"comedy's poet laureate\\". First placed on the schedule at 2:30 PM (1:30 Central), it was beaten by NBC's The Doctors. On December 29, the series moved to 1:30/12:30, which had been the home for Let's Make a Deal since 1964 (1968 on ABC). Rhyme inherited the vastly-changed competition at that timeslot from Deal, which now featured 60-minute versions of Days of Our Lives and As the World Turns, two very popular serials. Needless to say, Days and Turns overwhelmed Rhyme and the series ended its run two days after its first birthday. Its replacement would last nine times as long and would become television's most popular game within a year - Family Feud. Music The show's theme and cues were provided by Score Productions. The main theme song was called \\"Hilltop\\" and composed by Charles Fox. The pilot featured a hodgepodge of music, including an instrumental version of the Amboy Dukes hit Journey to the Center of Your Mind as its theme song and the opening notes to Perrey and Kingsley's The Savers (originally used on The Joker's Wild) as a reveal cue, as well as recycling the game win cue from Eubanks' previous series, The Newlywed Game. Episode status Rhyme and Reason is believed to be destroyed as per network practices of the time. The pilot exists on video, and the finale‚Äìin which the celebrities began destroying the set as the show progressed, breaking props, tearing the carpet, and knocking down Bob Eubanks's podium‚Äìwas discovered on audio tape in January 2011.

It has unlimited jurisdiction within the state in workers compensation matters. It was re-established on 1 August 1998 replacing the Compensation Court of New South Wales for most workers compensation matters. Jurisdiction in respect of the injury of police and miners was transferred to the District Court of New South Wales. Common law claims continue to remain the common law courts. Structure The Commission is presided over by a judge, called a President, and is appointed by the Governor of New South Wales on the recommendation of the Attorney General of New South Wales. The President is the head of the Commission and determines appeals and questions of law. The President also appoints the Commission approved medical specialists and mediators. The current President is the Hon. Judge Gerard Phillips. The President is supported by two Deputy presidents, who also hear appeals and are appointed by the Attorney General. The current two deputy presidents are Mr Michael Snell and Ms Elizabeth Wood. The Registrar oversees the day-to-day operations of the Commission and makes decisions about certain disputes. Arbitrators are decision makers who are independent of the worker, employer, insurer, or any other party involved in a dispute. History Workers compensation was first introduced into New South Wales with the introduction of the Workmens Compensation Act 1910 (NSW). The Act applied to dangerous occupations in which personal injury arose out of an accident or in the course of employment. The Workers Compensation Act 1926 (NSW) expanded the role of workers compensation in the State. It introduced compulsory insurance for employers and it also established the first specialised workers compensation tribunal in Australia, being the Workers Compensation Commission of New South Wales. The commission exercised both judicial and executive power. It was constituted with a judicial member and two lay members. The Commission also had the power to licence and supervise the operations of insurers. In 1984, the Workers Compensation Commission was replaced by two bodies, the State Compensation Board of New South Wales and the Compensation Court of New South Wales. The Board took over administrative and licensing functions which the commission formerly had, and the Court continued to exercise the judicial functions. In 1998, the tribunal was recreated and the Compensation court was abolished.

He commanded the 12th Infantry Division from 1927 to 1931. Biography In 1939 he signed the Franco-Polish Military Alliance. Later, he was interned in Romania after the evacuation of the Polish government following Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland and was only released in 1945. After the end of the Second World War, he emigrated to Canada. Kasprzycki graduated from General Pawe≈Ç Chrzanowski High School in Warsaw, after which he studied social studies and law at the Sorbonne and Geneva University. In the early 1910s, he joined the Union of Active Struggle and the Riflemen's Association. Before the outbreak of World War One, he graduated from Riflemen's Officer Academy in Str√≥≈ºe near Limanowa. In August 1914, Kasprzycki was named commander of the First Cadre Company. Later on, he was transferred to the headquarters of the 1st Brigade, Polish Legions. In the autumn of 1914, he joined Polish Military Organisation, helping to create its structures in the areas of Lublin and Warsaw. In 1917, Kasprzycki created the Association of Polish Military Organizations (ZwiƒÖzek Polskich Organizacji Wojskowych). On December 3, 1918, Kasprzycki became a member of J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski's office. In 1919, he went to Paris, to study at √âcole Militaire in Paris. After returning to Poland (1921) he took several posts in the Polish Army headquarters. In March 1927, he was appointed the commander of the 19th Infantry Division (Poland), stationed in Wilno. At the same time, he was Polish delegate to the Military Commission of the League of Nations. On January 1, 1929, Kasprzycki was promoted to the rank of Brigadier general, and in July 1931, he became Deputy Minister of Military Affairs. On May 12, 1935, after the death of J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, Kasprzycki was named Minister of Military Affairs by the President of Poland and remained in this post until September 30, 1939. On March 19, 1936, he was promoted to Divisional general. Apart from military activities, Kasprzycki was a member of several civilian organizations. In 1936, he was appointed the chairman of Main Committee of Mountain Congress, which took place in August of that year in Sanok. In December 1937, he was named chairman of Polish Association of Research Expeditions, and due to his efforts, a road along the ridge of Guba≈Ç√≥wka was built. Furthermore, he was a member of the Association of Development of Eastern Provinces. In the spring of 1939, Kasprzycki's wife Maria n√©e Strychalska committed suicide, and his son, who at that time was a high school student, broke all relations with the father. The probable cause of these events was Kasprzycki's affair with actress Zofia Kajzer√≥wna. During the Polish September Campaign, Kasprzycki, together with the government of Poland, was evacuated to Romania, where he was interned. In 1944 he arrived in Great Britain via Turkey. He wanted to join Polish Armed Forces in the West, but his application was rejected by W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski, who claimed that Kasprzycki was one of the people directly responsible for Polish defeat in September 1939.

CART appears to have roles in reward, feeding, and stress, and it has the functional properties of an endogenous psychostimulant.  Function  CART is a neuropeptide that produces similar behavior in animals as cocaine and amphetamine, but conversely blocks the effects of cocaine when they are co- administered. The peptide is found in several areas, among them the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the brain. When CART was injected into rat VTA, increased locomotor activity was seen, which is one of the signs of \\"central stimulation\\" caused by psychostimulants, such as cocaine and amphetamine. The same rats also tended to return to the place where they were injected. This is called conditioned place preference and is also seen after injection of cocaine. CART peptides, in particular, CART(55‚Äì102), seem to have an important function in the regulation of energy homeostasis, and interact with several hypothalamic appetite circuits. CART expression is regulated by several peripheral peptide hormones involved in appetite regulation, including leptin, cholecystokinin and ghrelin, with CART and cholecystokinin having synergistic effects on appetite regulation. CART is released in response to repeated dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens, and may regulate the activity of neurons in this area. CART production is upregulated by CREB, a protein thought to be involved with the development of drug addiction, and CART may be an important therapeutic target in the treatment of stimulant abuse.  Tissue distribution  CART is an anorectic peptide and is widely expressed in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, particularly concentrated in the hypothalamus. CART is also expressed outside of the nervous system in pituitary endocrine cells, adrenomedullary cells, islet somatostatin cells, and in rat antral gastrin cells. Other structures and pathways associated with CART expression include the mesolimbic pathway (linking the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens) and amygdala. CART is also found in a subset of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the primary afferent neurons in the retina. Specifically, it labels ON/OFF Direction Selective Ganglion Cells (ooDSGCs), a subpopulation of RGCs that stratify in both the ON and OFF sublamina of the Inner Plexiform Layer (IPL) of the retina. It is also found in a subset of amacrine cells in the Inner Nuclear Layer. No role as of yet has been proposed for the peculiar location of this protein in these cell types.  Clinical significance  Studies of CART(54‚Äì102) action in rat lateral ventricle and amygdala suggest that CART plays a role in anxiety-like behavior, induced by ethanol withdrawal in rats. Studies on CART knock-out mice indicates that CART modulates the locomotor, conditioned place preference and cocaine self- administration effects of psychostimulants. This suggests a positive neuromodulatory action of CART on the effects of psychostimulants in rats. CART is altered in the ventral tegmental area of cocaine overdose victims, and a mutation in the CART gene is associated with alcoholism. By inhibiting the rewarding effects of cocaine, CART has a potential use in treating cocaine addiction. CART peptides are inhibitors of food intake (anorectic) and closely associated with leptin and neuropeptide Y, two important food intake regulators. CART hypoactivity in the hypothalamus of depressed animals is associated with hyperphagia and weight gain. CART is thought to play a key role in the opioid mesolimbic dopamine circuit that modulates natural reward processes. CART also appears to play an important role in higher brain functions like cognition.  History  CART was found by examining changes in the brain following cocaine or amphetamine administration. CART mRNA increased with cocaine administration. One of the goals was to find an endogenous anoretic substance. CART inhibited rat food intake by as much as 30 percent. When naturally occurring CART peptides were blocked by means of injecting antibodies for CART, feeding was increased. This led to suggestions that CART may play a role ‚Äì though not being the only peptide ‚Äì in satiety. In the late 1980s, researchers started to synthesize structurally cocaine-like and functionally CART-like substances in order to find medications that could help treat eating disorders as well as cocaine abuse. Chemically, these substances belong to phenyltropanes. CART receptor The putative receptor target for CART has not yet been identified as of 2011, however in vitro studies strongly suggest that CART binds to a specific G protein-coupled receptor coupled to Gi/Go, resulting in increased ERK release inside the cell. Several fragments of CART have been tested to try and uncover the pharmacophore, but the natural splicing products CART(55‚Äì102) and CART(62‚Äì102) are still of highest activity, with the reduced activity of smaller fragments thought to indicate that a compact structure retaining all three of CART's disulphide bonds is preferred.

Congress of Industrial Organizations, 335 U.S. 106 (1948), is a US labor law decision by the United States Supreme Court, which held that a labor union's publication of a statement that advocated for its members to vote for a certain candidate for Congress did not violate the Federal Corrupt Practices Act, as amended by the 1947 Labor Management Relations Act. Facts Philip Murray, the president of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), had established a permanent political action committee (PAC) known as \\"CIO-PAC\\" in 1942. However, the CIO's political efforts were only marginally effective, and in 1946, the Republicans won a majority in both houses of Congress. In 1947, Congress passed the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, better known as the Taft-Hartley Act. Section 304 amended Section 313 of the Federal Corrupt Practices Act to make it unlawful for any labor organization to make a contribution or expenditure in connection with any election in which presidential and vice presidential electors or a member of Congress are to be voted for or in connection with any primary election, political convention or caucus to select candidates for such offices. President Harry S Truman vetoed the Act, but Congress overrode his veto on June 23, 1947. On July 14, 1947, the CIO published its regular edition of \\"The CIO News,\\" the labor federation's magazine. On the front page was a statement by Murray, who urged members of the CIO in Maryland to vote for Judge Ed Garmatz, a candidate for Congress in a special election to be held July 15, 1947. Murray's statement also said that the message was being published because Murray and the CIO believed that amended Section 313 unconstitutionally infringed on the rights of free speech, press, and assembly, which are guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. In January 1948, Murray and the CIO were indicted in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The defendants moved to dismiss the charges on constitutional grounds. On March 15, 1948, the district court agreed (77 F. Supp. 355) and dismissed the indictment. The government appealed to the Supreme Court, which accepted certiorari. Jesse Climenko served as attorney for the appellant. Charles J. Margiotti of Pittsburgh and Lee Pressman of Washington, DC, served as attorneys for the appellees. Judgment Justice Stanley Forman Reed delivered the opinion for the court. Reed refused to reach the constitutional question before the court but argued instead that the use of funds to publish the statement did not constitute an \\"expenditure\\" under Section 313, as amended. Reed concluded that the term \\"expenditure\\" was not a term of art and had no defined meaning. \\"The purpose of Congress is a dominant factor in determining meaning,\\" he wrote. \\"There is no better key to a difficult problem of statutory construction than the law from which the challenged statute emerged.\\"United States v. Congress of Industrial Organizations, 335 U.S. 106, 112. Reed reviewed the enactment of the Federal Corrupt Practices Act in 1910 as well as its 1911 and 1925 amendments, the court's ruling in Newberry v. United States, and the limitations imposed on unions' political expenditures by the 1943 War Labor Disputes Act. Quoting extensively from Congressional debates over Section 304 of the Taft-Hartley Act, Reed concluded that Congress clearly did not intend for the act to cover union newspapers supported by advertising or member subscriptions. Reed acknowledged that some members of Congress contemplated a different reading of Section 304. However, such contradictory statements could be dismissed as not indicative of the sense of Congress, Reed said, as \\"the language itself, coupled with the dangers of unconstitutionality, supports the interpretation which we have placed upon it.\\"United States v. Congress of Industrial Organizations, 335 U.S. 106, 122. :It would require explicit words in an act to convince us that Congress intended to bar a trade journal, a house organ or a newspaper, published by a corporation, from expressing views on candidates or political proposals in the regular course of its publication. It is unduly stretching language to say that the members or stockholders are unwilling participants in such normal organizational activities, including the advocacy thereby of governmental policies affecting their interests, and the support thereby of candidates thought to be favorable to their interests.United States v. Congress of Industrial Organizations, 335 U.S. 106, 123. Frankfurter's concurrence Justice Felix Frankfurter issued a concurring opinion: \\"A case or controversy in the sense of a litigation ripe and right for constitutional adjudication by this Court implies a real contest ‚Äî an active clash of views, based upon an adequate formulation of issues, so as to bring a challenge to that which Congress has enacted inescapably before the Court,\\" Frankfurter wrote.United States v. Congress of Industrial Organizations, 335 U.S. 106, 125. Rather, Frankfurter said, the constitutional and the interpretative issues were ripe for review. Frankfurter pointed out that during oral argument before the Supreme Court, the federal government claimed that the district court had misread and misinterpreted its claims. The district court, Frankfurter said, had three times argued that the government had admitted that Section 304 abridged rights guaranteed by the First Amendment. However, that was not the admission of the government, federal attorneys said. If the court had misinterpreted the government's position, Frankfurter concluded, the case should be remanded for further proceedings rather than adjudicated. However, since a majority has seen fit to grant certiorari, Frankfurter reluctantly agreed to concur in the majority opinion. Rutledge's concurrence Justice Rutledge also issued a concurring opinion, in which Justices Black, Douglas and Murphy joined. Rutledge argued that a close reading of the legislative history finds \\"a veritable fog of contradictions relating to specific possible applications\\" of Section 304.United States v. Congress of Industrial Organizations, 335 U.S. 106, 134. With no clear legislative guidance, Rutledge argued for a plain reading of the term \\"expenditure.\\" A dictionary definition of the term shows that it does not matter whether a union publication is supported by general union dues or by advertising and/or subscription; an expenditure is an expenditure, which is prohibited by the Act. That forces the Court to reach the constitutional question, Rutledge argued, and the Act plainly is unconstitutional on such grounds. The statute was not narrowly drawn and did not specifically proscribe the conduct to be prohibited. Rather, it imposed a blanket prohibition on labor union participation in the political process, and that was patently unconstitutional: \\"To say that labor unions as such have nothing of value to contribute to that process and no vital or legitimate interest in it is to ignore the obvious facts of political and economic life and of their increasing interrelationship in modern society.\\"United States v. Congress of Industrial Organizations, 335 U.S. 106, 144. The majority, Rutledge pointed out, also cites Congressional debate, which indicates a purpose of the statute was to protect minority interests within labor unions. However, even if that reading of the statute's legislative history were correct, the statute would still be unconstitutionally overbroad in reaching that objective. Rutledge would also have found the statute unconstitutional under the majority's interpretation of the meaning of \\"expenditure.\\" The majority twists itself into knots to distinguish between general union support for a publication and advertising- or subscription-supported support. However, that, too, runs afoul of the Constitution, Rutledge concluded. \\"I know of nothing in the Amendment's policy or history which turns or permits turning the applicability of its protections upon the difference between regular and merely casual or occasional distributions.... Neither freedom of speech and the press nor the right of peaceable assembly is restricted to persons who can and do pay.\\"United States v. Congress of Industrial Organizations, 335 U.S. 106, 155.

Setting it apart from its coastal neighbours of Calpe and further south, Benidorm, the town council passed laws limiting the height of buildings and protecting the natural pines that cover the sides of the valley leading to the coastal part of the municipality, Moraira. History The earliest signs of a settlement date back to the Upper Paleolithic Period (15-20,000 BC) with remains discovered in a cave on the headland (Cap d‚ÄôOr). Teulada was founded in 1386 and during the 16th century was fortified due to the constant attacks by Barbary pirates. The lookout tower on the peninsular headland still remains and has been restored. The economy was dominated by agriculture influenced by the period of occupation by the Moors. The walled terraces on the hillsides of the area are still present and allowed for orchards of almonds, vines and citrus fruits to be grown. Economy The economy of Teulada is dominated by the tourism industry and fuelled by the construction industry which is forever expanding the community size. The influence of the European expatriate community of predominantly English, German and Dutch residents has grown to the extent that in 1999 a political party of predominantly non-Spanish residents, The Moraira Party, won control of the town hall in local elections. Since this time there has been a progressive investment policy in local facilities especially in the coastal area of Moraira. Teulada still manages to retain its Spanish heritage and traditions.

Early life and education Born in Shepherdstown, Virginia (now West Virginia) in 1815, to the former Helen Robinson and her husband Dr. Henry Boteler (1779-1836). Alexander Boteler's maternal great-grandfather was the painter, soldier and naturalist Charles Willson Peale.Sons of the American Revolution application of Henry D'Arcy Didier dated May 31, 1928, on ancestry.com Boteler's mother died when he was five years old, and his father sent him to Baltimore to be raised by his grandfather, merchant Alexander Robinson until he was eleven. He received a private education suitable for his class, even meeting General Lafayette during his tour of the United States. Boteler graduated from Princeton College in 1835, then returned to Virginia. In 1836 in New Jersey, Alexander Boteler married Helen Macomb Stockton (1815-1891), and they had a son Alexander Boteler Jr. (1842-1893; who attended the University of Virginia and had a stammer)https://www.gutenberg.org/files/22067/22067-h/22067-h.htm and several daughters: Elizabeth Stockton Shepherd (1837-1866; whose husband architect Rezin Davis Shepherd died in 1862), Angelica Peale Boteler Didier (1839-1912; widow of Henry Didier); Helen Macomb Boteler Pendleton (1840‚Äì1914; wife of C.S.A. Capt. Dudley Digges Pendleton) and Charlotte Boteler Johnson (1844‚Äì1899; widow of George M. Johnson). His younger brother Henry Boteler (1817-1847) who married Anne Harris Morgan and whose sons Henry Boteler and Charles Peale Boteler would volunteer with the Rockbridge artillery, soon joined by their cousin Alexander Boteler Jr. (who had originally enlisted in the 2nd Virginia Infantry as a private, but became a lieutenant with the Rockbridge Artillery and later served as ordinance officer at various places. They all survived the war despite being wounded several times.Robert J. Driver, The 1st and 2nd Rockbridge Artillery (Virginia Regimental History Series, H.E. Howard Inc. 1987), p. Career When Dr. Boteler, his father, died in 1836, Alexander Boteler inherited a plantation and house (\\"Fountain Rock\\") and significant debts, which he paid off with the assistance of his wife's inheritance as well as his grandfather Robinson. Boteler also throughout his life championed the new steamboat technology (which he witnessed as a boy on the Potomac River at Shepherdstown), and the inventor James Rumsey. His father and George Reynolds had also built a cement mill, crushing limestone common in the area for use building the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal nearby, as well as buildings in Washington D.C. and Georgetown downriver (or down the canal). Henry Boteler sold his interest to his partner in 1835, but Alexander Boteler would buy the mill from Reynolds in 1846, and operate it until August 1861, when it was destroyed by Union forces.http://jeffersoncountyhlc.org/index.php/articles/the-cement-mill-ruins- a-story-of-industry-and-war/ Boteler became known as a progressive farmer, using a \\"wheat cutter\\" to harvest his major crop, as well as hotbeds to start market crops. He also had livestock and experimented with grafting varieties of fruit and nut trees. Boteler helped found the Jefferson County Agricultural Society and became its president in 1850. He lectured on farming techniques at the Ohio State Agricultural Fair, the Shenandoah Valley Agricultural Society, and the Agricultural Society of Hagerstown, Maryland.Morgans Grove NRIS p. 15 of 43 In 1840, Boteler owned 13 slaves, which number grew by 1860 only to 15 slaves (all but 3 of them adults).1840 U.S. Federal census for Jefferson County, Virginia, p. 3 of 66 (digitized as \\"Alex R. Bolelu\\")1860 U.S. Federal census for Jefferson County, Virginia, Slave Schedules, p. 9 of 441860 Virginia slave schedules for Jefferson County are not available online, nor is the initial West Virginia census; the family does not appear in the 1850 or 1860 federal census, possibly due to digitizing or indexing issues. This was in part due to his signing a $20,000 note for a friend, who defaulted, so that about half of Boteler's plantation was sold in 1852. Furthermore, he financially backed the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, although traffic on the canal decreased as the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad completed track first to Martinsburg, then reached Wheeling, West Virginia, in 1853.Morgans Grove NRIS pp. 15-16 of 43 Boteler was also an artist and author. He published an illustrated book, My Ride to the Barbecue in 1860 about a major civic event he hosted on September 11, 1858 (probably in conjunction with his political campaign described below), which reportedly 5000 people attended.Morgans Grove NRIS p. 16 of 43 Politics and John Brown's Raid Boteler was fascinated by politics and was a member of several small and short-lived political parties. He was briefly the national secretary of the Know Nothing Party, and at other times a member of the Whigs (a delegate to the Richmond convention and presidential elector in 1852), and in 1860 became the national secretary of the Constitutional Union Party. He unsuccessfully ran as a Whig against incumbent Congressman Charles J. Faulkner (a Democrat) in 1853 and 1855, but defeated Faulkner in 1858 (Faulkner successfully ran against former Congressman William Lucas in 1857).http://www.lva.virginia.gov/public/dvb/bio.asp?b=Faulkner_Charles_James Accounts of Boteler's party affiliation vary: from \\"Opposition\\" to a member of the American Party (which was nativist and related to the Know Nothings) or as a Whig. During John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry, upon hearing of a possible insurrection from one of his daughters, Boteler hurried from his home ten miles down to Harpers Ferry, where he interviewed and sketched the rebel, among others. Boteler represented Virginia's 8th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives from 1859 until resigning after Virginia voted for secession in April 1861.after which the seat remained technically vacant for a decade, in part due to controversy over the status of Jefferson and neighboring Berkeley Counties, decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in Virginia v. West Virginia(1871) In a widely acclaimed speech as the House was organized in January 1860, Boteler declared himself for Union, as well as decried abolitionism and those who supported John Brown's raid, accusing them of encouraging the bloodbath he had witnessed at Harpers Ferry. In March 1861, Boteler met the newly elected President Abraham Lincoln and attempted to lobby him against a use of force bill. He would resign about a month later.The congressional seat then remained technically vacant for a decade, in part due to controversy over the status of Jefferson and neighboring Berkeley Counties, decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in Virginia v. West Virginia(1871)). American Civil War At the outbreak of the Civil War, Boteler sympathized with Virginia and his family's way of life. He enlisted in the Confederate Army and received a colonel's commission. However, he often noted his delicate constitution and did relatively little soldiering, unlike his son who enlisted in the Rockbridge Artillery. In 1861 Boteler was chosen by the Virginia Convention to be a representative to the Provisional Confederate Congress. Later that year, Jefferson County voters and others in Virginia's 10th Congressional District elected Boteler as a Democrat [sic] to represent Virginia's 10th District in the Confederate States House of Representatives. Boteler was a member of the 3-man committee that designed the Confederate government's seal, which featured an image of George Washington. He failed to win re-election in 1864, losing to disabled Confederate veteran (and future Virginia governor) Frederick W.M. Holliday. Meanwhile, Boteler's neighbor, William Augustine Morgan, had led the Shepherdstown Cavalry for several years (including responding to the 1859 John Brown raid). Morgan also became a Confederate colonel early in the war, and would fight many battles including under Generals Jackson and Stuart and not capitulate at the war's end. Boteler's son fought in the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861. Less than a month later, Union troops arrested Alexander Boteler at his home, \\"Fountain Rock\\" outside Shepardstown and imprisoned across the river. He convinced his captors to release him, but Union troops burned his cement mill on August 19, 1861, as an alleged snipers nest.Miles High, The C&O; Canal Companion: A journey through Potomac history, (Johns Hopkins University Press 2015) p. 231, available at https://books.google.com/books?id=wjIqBgAAQBAJ&pg;=PA231 The \\"Pleasant Valley\\" area was often contested; various troops would burn his plantation's fields many times during the conflict, and Union forces would captured four Confederate cannon in the mill ruins following the Battle of Antietam. The cement mill would also figure in the Battle of Shepherdstown in September 1862. Fountain Rock became a hospital for soldiers wounded at the Battle of Antietam, and also experience fighting in July 1863. His major contribution to the Confederacy was political. In November 1861 Confederate papers publicized his escape from Union raiders at Fountain Rock, and his wife's outrage at the Yankee action. The following spring, Boteler convinced General Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson not to return to VMI, then continued on Jackson's staff as a courier or liaison until the general's death. Boteler returned to Richmond and his legislative duties, then in August 1863 volunteered to serve on the staff of General J. E. B. Stuart (where he continued to serve until that general's death).Robert J. Trout, They Followed the Plume: The Story of J.E.B. Stuart and His Staff (Stackpole Books 2003) pp. 69-70, available at https://books.google.com/books?id=Gq1z-YKc-K8C&pg;=PA68&lpg;= In February 1864, on General Stuart's recommendation, Boteler became a military judge, and remained such for the remainder of the war.Trout pp. 70-71 In July 1864, Union troops (following orders of Union General David Hunter during the final campaign against rebel sympathizers) looted and burned Fountain Rock, although only occupied by Boteler's wife, daughters and grandchildren. They had spent part of the war in Baltimore, and Lettie in particular was a fervent Confederate supporter. Fountain Rock was one of several plantations ordered destroyed: the homes of Andrew Hunter near Charles Town and \\"Bedford\\", the home of Edmund J. Lee (cousin of the Confederate general) were also burned per that order, although the home of Charles J. Faulkner in Martinsburg would be spared based on the entreaties of his wife and Union-allied relatives.Bushong, Millard Kessler (1941). A History of Jefferson County, West Virginia, 1719‚Äì1940 pp. 231-232. On April 25, 1865, Boteler wrote his wife about his attempt to return to Petersburg on April 2, 1865, then receiving a parole from Grant at Appomattox Court House on April 9, falling ill during his journey to devastated Richmond (feeling \\"utterly lost and bewildered in the midst of ruins which extend as far as the eye can reach\\"), and being unable to return home via the railroad from Baltimore because of Lincoln's assassination. Postwar years After the war, Boteler's cement mill was sold at auction in 1867 since he lacked funds to rebuild it (having invested in Confederate war bonds). Rebuilt by investors, it remained in operation until 1901.High pp. 231-232 Living in Shepherdstown, Boteler remained active in his community. He led projects to bring the Shenandoah Valley Railroad to Shepardstown, as well as to connect his hometown by telegraph to the wider world. In 1871, Boteler helped found Shepherd College, in the vacant building built by his late son- in-law that Shepherdstown had hoped would remain the county courthouse (Charles Town regained the county seat after considerable litigation). Boteler benefited from legislation restoring political rights to Confederates in June 1872, and then unsuccessfully ran for Congress as an Independent in 1872 and 1874. Boteler also continued to write and sketch, although his books about James Rumsey and about temperance were never published. He traveled widely, speaking at Confederate reunions, which delighted in his tales about Stonewall Jackson and J.E.B. Stuart as well as John Brown's raid. In 1883, Boteler responded to a speech by Frederick Douglass at the dedication of Storer College in Harpers Ferry by publishing an article about his experience of that raid in Century Magazine. A decade later the Boston Military History Society bought some of his sketches. His account of Stonewall Jackson's Campaign in 1862 was published posthumously by the Southern Historical Society. Appointed West Virginia's representative to the Centennial Commission in 1873,U.S. Register of Civil, Military and Naval Service (vol. I, 1873) p. 24. In 1875, Andrew J. Sweeney was added as another West Virginia representative; Edmund R. Baggwell would join Walter W. Wood as the Virginia representatives to the commission and John S. Barbour would be the Vice President of Finance. Report of the Centennial Commission (1875) p. 5. Botler was later appointed a member of the Tariff Commission by President Chester A. Arthur (which caused him to travel widely in 1882-1884). He also was employed as a pardon clerk in the Department of Justice by Attorney General Benjamin H. Brewster, serving until 1889. (Following the Panic of 1890, the Republican party would lose badly in the 1990 election) In 1885, the Morgans Grove Agricultural Association held a fair on the property of his neighbor William A. Morgan. The Shenandoah Valley Railroad built a stop for the event, which was a great success. The fair continued annually, becoming a four day event and in June 1889 the association bought Boteler's Fountain Rock property, moved some fair buildings onto it, then constructed a wooden pavilion in 1890.Morgans Grove NRIS p. 16-17 of 43 Death and legacy Boteler died in Shepherdstown, West Virginia, on May 8, 1892, months after his wife of five decades and was interred with her at Elmwood Cemetery. Duke University's library holds the Boteler family's papers. His diary is in the William Elizabeth Brooks Collection in the Library of Congress.Robert J. Trout, With Pen & Saber, The letters and diaries of J.E.B. Stuart's Staff Officers (Stackpole Books, 1995) p. xii The ruins of Boteler's cement mill still exist and were bought in 2011 by a coalition of government and nonprofit groups, with the intention of adding that site to the Antietam National Battlefield Park. The former site of \\"Fountain Head\\" overlooking the Potomac River became the site for the gazebo in Morgans Grove Park. Only the spring house (constructed by his father in 1831) remains from Boteler's lifetime. The fairs continued annually after Boteler sold the acreage in 1889, but came on hard times in 1931, so the property was sold to a farmer circa 1941. The Shepherdstown Mens Club bought 20 acres in 1961 for use as a civic park; a gazebo was built on the overlook where the Fountain Head manor house had once stood.Morgans Grove NRIS p. 11 of 43, available at http://www.wvculture.org/shpo/nr/pdf/jefferson/99000286.pdf Shepherd College in 1952 erected a male residence hall and named it for Boteler, but it was demolished in 1990 when asbestos was discovered.

Updated: Sep 25, 2008 (usually a 50% decline in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) within 3 months) with glomerular crescent formation seen in at least 50% or 75% of glomeruli seen on kidney biopsies. If left untreated, it rapidly progresses into acute kidney failure and death within months. In 50% of cases, RPGN is associated with an underlying disease such as Goodpasture syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus or granulomatosis with polyangiitis; the remaining cases are idiopathic. Regardless of the underlying cause, RPGN involves severe injury to the kidneys' glomeruli, with many of the glomeruli containing characteristic glomerular crescents (crescent-shaped scars). Signs and symptoms Most types of RPGN are characterized by severe and rapid loss of kidney function with marked hematuria; red blood cell casts in the urine; and proteinuria sometimes exceeding three grams in twenty-four hours, a range associated with nephrotic syndrome. Some patients also experience hypertension and edema. Severe disease is characterized by pronounced oliguria or anuria, which portends a poor prognosis. Pathophysiology 130 px It is thought that antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) interact with antigens in the cytoplasm of neutrophils to cause an early degranulation, triggering the release of lytic enzymes at the site of injury and leading to the formation of glomerular crescents that consist primarily of parietal epithelial cells from Bowman's capsule and in some cases podocytes. Diagnosis Serum analysis often aids in the diagnosis of a specific underlying disease. The presence of anti- glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibodies suggests type I RPGN; antinuclear antibodies (ANA) may support a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus and type II RPGN; and type III and idiopathic RPGN are frequently associated with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)-positive serum. Impaired kidney function in an individual who has had the condition for fewer than three months is characteristic of RPGN. An ultrasonographic examination of the abdomen should be obtained. Although the presence of sediment in the urine on examination can indicate proliferative glomerulonephritis, many cases of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis need a renal biopsy to make a diagnosis. Classification Crescentic glomerulonephritis RPGN can be classified into three types, based upon the immunofluorescence patterns: =Type I= Accounting for approximately 20% of RPGN, type I RPGN, also called anti-GBM glomerulonephritis, is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies directed against type IV collagen (specifically, the noncollagenous region of its Œ±3 chain) in the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). Some cases are associated with antibodies directed against the basement membrane of lung alveoli, producing Goodpasture syndrome. The majority of type I disease, however, features anti-GBM antibodies alone; these cases are considered idiopathic. =Type II= Characterized by deposition of immune complexes in glomerular tissues, type II RPGN accounts for 25% of cases. Any immune complex disease‚Äîincluding systemic lupus erythematosus, acute proliferative glomerulonephritis, Henoch‚ÄìSch√∂nlein purpura, and IgA nephropathy‚Äîthat involves the glomerulus may progress to RPGN if severe enough. =Type III= Also known as pauci-immune RPGN, type III RPGN accounts for 55% of RPGN and features neither immune complex deposition nor anti-GBM antibodies. Instead, the glomeruli are damaged in an undefined manner, perhaps through the activation of neutrophils in response to ANCA. Type III RPGN may be isolated to the glomerulus (primary, or idiopathic) or associated with a systemic disease (secondary). In most cases of the latter, the systemic disease is an ANCA-associated vasculitis such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis or eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Treatment Therapy consists of a combination of rituximab, corticosteroids, and cyclophosphamide, with a substitution of azathioprine for cyclophosphamide after a ninety-day initial period being another option. When remission is achieved, immunosuppressants are still used, usually corticosteroids with azathioprine or rituximab infusions. Epidemiology The incidence rate of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis is approximately 3.9 individuals per million.

If activated to federal service the Wing would be gained by the United States Air Force Air Combat Command. Overview The main operations unit of the wing is the 110th Air Operations Group, a remote-split operations center for MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper operations for Third Air Force. The aircraft and a contingent of maintainers are deployed forward, along with some pilots to handle takeoffs and landings, but the majority of the pilots remain stateside and operate the aircraft via satellite communications links. Units * 110th Operations Group ** 172d Air Support Squadron * 110th Maintenance Group * 110th Mission Support Group * 110th Medical Group * 217th Air Operations Group History In 1956 the 172d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron (FIS) of the Michigan Air National Guard was authorized to expand to a group level, and the United States Air Force constituted the 110th Fighter Group (Air Defense) and associated support units and allotted them to the Air National Guard for activation. The 172d FIS became the group's flying squadron. Other squadrons assigned into the group were the 110th Material Squadron, 110th Air Base Squadron, and the 110th USAF Dispensary. In 1957, the 172d FIS received a new aircraft, the RB-57 Canberra, and a new mission ‚Äì tactical reconnaissance. The resulting reorganization cost the 110th Fighter Group 40 percent of its manpower and its name ‚Äì the group was inactivated and the 172d, now the 172d Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, once again became Battle Creek's primary Air National Guard unit. The activation of a non-flying squadron, the 127th Reconnaissance Technical Squadron, helped prevent the loss of additional Guard members. In 1962, the 110th Tactical Reconnaissance Group and support organizations were reactivated with Major Howard Strand serving as its commander. Major Strand departed in January 1965 to become deputy commander of the 127th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing at Selfridge AFB, Michigan. He returned again in 1974 to lead the 110th until 1981. The 172d flew Canberras until 1971, when it undertook the radical and unexpected transformation from the RB-57 jets to the smaller, prop-powered Cessna O-2 Skymaster. On 11 June 1971, the 110th Tactical Reconnaissance Group became the 110th Tactical Air Support Group. In 1980, the 110th saw a return to jet power when it reequipped with OA-37 Dragonfly. In 1991 the 110th Tactical Air Support Group transitioned from the Dragonfly to the OA-10 Thunderbolt II, and was redesignated the 110th Fighter Group. In June 1995 the 110th Fighter Group became the 110th Fighter Wing. In 1997 the wing took part in Operation Deny Flight. The 110th Fighter Wing served in both Iraq and Afghanistan, supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. In May 1999 the 110th Fighter Wing was deployed to Trapani Italy in support of Operation Noble Anvil, the air operations over Kosovo. The 110th Fighter Wing underwent a major transition moving from the A-10 aircraft to the Learjet C-21A aircraft in 2008. The C-21, which arrived in October 2008, is a twin turbofan engine passenger aircraft, the military version of the Lear Jet 35A. With a crew of two, it can accommodate eight passengers and of cargo. For aero medical evacuations, it can carry one little litter or five ambulatory patients plus one flight nurse and two medical technicians. The 110th Fighter Wing was redesignated as the 110th Airlift Wing with no change in station. It changed from an Air Combat Command unit to an Air Mobility Command unit on 1 December 2009. The base also witnessed the creation of a new unit, the 217th Air Operations Group (AOG) on 1 April 2009. The 217th AOG is an organization supporting the 17th Air Force (AFAFRICA). The 217th AOG has four squadrons that include intelligence, communications, operations and Air Force Forces planning in a largely self- contained package. On 13 December 2014, in a ceremony presided by Gov. Rick Snyder, the wing was redesignated as the 110th Attack Wing. On 1 March 2019, the wing was officially renamed from the 110th Attack Wing to 110th Wing by the National Guard Bureau, Washington, D.C.https://www.dvidshub.net/news/313076/new-designation-battle-creek-air- guard-wing-seals-mission-relevance-versatility Lineage * Constituted as the 110th Fighter Group (Air Defense)and allotted to the Air National Guard on 15 April 1956 : Extended federal recognition and activated on 1 September 1956 : Inactivated c. 12 April 1958 * Redesignated 110th Tactical Reconnaissance Group : Activated on 1 October 1962 : Redesignated 110th Tactical Air Support Group on 11 June 1971 : Redesignated 110th Fighter Group on 16 October 1991 : Redesignated 110th Fighter Wing on 1 October 1995 : Redesignated 110th Airlift Wing, 1 March 2009 : Redesignated 110th Attack Wing, 13 December 2014 : Redesignated 110th Wing Assignments * 127th Air Defense Wing, 1 September 1956 ‚Äì 12 April 1958 * 127th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, 1 October 1962 * Michigan Air National Guard, 11 June 1971 * 128th Tactical Fighter Wing (later 128th Fighter Wing), 16 October 1991 * Michigan Air National Guard, 1 October 1995 ; Gaining Commands :: Air Defense Command, 1 September 1956 ‚Äì 12 April 1958 :: Tactical Air Command, 1 October 1962 :: Air Combat Command, 1 June 1992 :: Air Mobility Command, 1 March 2009 :: Air Combat Command, 1 October 2013 Components Groups * 110th Operations Group, 1 June 1992 ‚Äì present * 110th Logistics Group (later 110th Maintenance Group), 1 October 1995 ‚Äì 30 September 2013 * 110th Medical Group, 15 October 1962 ‚Äì PresentThis unit was designated the 110th USAF Dispensary, 110th Tactical Dispensary, 110th Tactical Clinic, and 110th Medical Squadron before becoming a group in June 2004. * 110th Support Group (later 110th Mission Support Group), 1 October 1995 ‚Äì present * 217th Air Operations Group, 1 April 2009 ‚Äì present Operational Squadron * 172d Airlift Squadron,Earlier 172d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, 172d Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, 110th Tactical Air Support Squadron, 110th Fighter Squadron 1 September 1956 ‚Äì 30 June 1957; 1 October 1962 ‚Äì 1 June 1992 Stations * W.

He was a younger brother of German film director Robert Wiene (The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari).  Biography  Conrad Wiene was born in Vienna, younger son of the successful actor Carl Wiene, in whose footsteps Conrad initially followed as a stage and screen actor. He co-directed his first films with his elder brother Robert, and later made almost twenty feature films, mostly silent. On most of them he also wrote the screenplays. He worked in Berlin, Prague and Breslau (Wroc≈Çaw) and above all in Vienna, where several of his silent films were shot in the Sch√∂nbrunn Studios (Sch√∂nbrunn-Ateliers). His name was connected with the first proposal in 1930 in Vienna to film Lion Feuchtwanger's 1925 historical novel Jud S√º√ü (\\"Jew S√ºss\\"), but the project never reached the production stage.The novel was later filmed in England, in 1934, and again in 1940 in Nazi Germany, by Veit Harlan. While the British film, Jew Suss, can be seen today as sympathetic towards Jews and indirectly critical of National Socialist policy towards the Jews, the later German adaptation Jud S√º√ü was an infamous anti-semitic film on permanent release during World War II in all occupied countries. With the arrival and dominance of sound film, Wiene worked in Germany. After Adolf Hitler took power in Germany in 1933, Wiene, who was Jewish,Siegbert Salomon Prawer, Between Two Worlds: The Jewish Presence in German and Austrian Film, 1910‚Äì1933, Berghahn Books (2007), p. 211 left Berlin for Vienna.

It is located in the town of Sentani District, approximately 40 km from downtown Jayapura; the name 'Sentani' is taken from a Lake Sentani nearby. It is the easternmost airport in Indonesia, the largest airport in Papua and the main hub to outside the island of Papua, Since 14 October 2019 the management of the airport is taken over by PT Angkasa Pura I (Persero). History Sentani Airport was a part of the large American facilities at Hollandia (now Jayapura), which was seized from the Japanese during World War II by an American amphibious task force Code named Operation Reckless on 22 April 1944. The area was occupied by the Japanese in April 1942, and by 10 October 1943, the Japanese had built a large complex with two runways: a western runway of 4,500 ft and a second southern runway was 6,200 ft x 340 ft. There were 24 larger bomber revetments to the west of the strip, and an additional 27 to the east of the field, connected by taxiways to the two runways. Anti-aircraft defenses included 4 light guns that were later upgraded. The airfields were badly cratered by American bomber raids. Once controlled by the Americans, the airfields were rebuilt and it became a command and control base with large numbers of operational units flying combat missions with fighters and heavy bombers operating out of the area. The American facilities consisted of three large military airfields: Hollandia, Sentani and Cyclops Airfields. At the end of the war, Hollandia Airfield was abandoned, and until the early 2010s, it was reclaimed by natural overgrowth. The latest aerial imagery of this area now show a large housing development project underway on the site. Cyclops Airfield, which was a single runway facility to the northeast of Sentani Airfield and originally built by the Japanese, was also abandoned and is now part of the town of Sentani. This field is notable because it functioned as MacArthur's HQ at Hollandia. Sentani Airfield is the only part of the complex still in use as an airfield today. It is used as the principal entry point into the Indonesian half of the island of Papua.

It has one runway designated 12/30 with an asphalt surface measuring . Sentani airport has three airbridges. Airlines and destinations=PassengerCargo The airport serves as the main port of entry into the island of Indonesian New Guinea. The air traffic is roughly divided between flights connecting to destinations within the Papua province and flights linking Papua to other parts of Indonesia. Sentani Airport is also the main base for several aviation organizations, including Associated Mission Aviation, Mission Aviation Fellowship, YAJASI and Tariku Aviation. Airport facility improvements In October 2012, The Ministry of Transportation announced plans to extend the length of the airport's runway to 3,000 meters, add a parallel taxiway, and to expand the passenger terminal to accommodate jet bridges to board and disembark passengers. As of the end of 2015, the airport incorporates all the aforementioned improvements. Culture hygiene Unlike typical airport terminals around the world, Sentani Airport features signs that read \\"Dilarang makan pinang\\" (translated, \\"Consumption of betel nuts is prohibited\\") posted on walls throughout the terminal. A sight that often attracts the attention of foreign travelers, these were posted in the late 2000s as the airport management's response to the local population's tendencies to chew areca nuts then dispose of red residue (caused by chewing) by spitting on public ground, leaving an ungainly stain on the ground.Ssstt...

Sioux Nation of Indians, 448 U.S. 371 (1980), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that: 1) the enactment by Congress of a law allowing the Sioux Nation to pursue a claim against the United States that had been previously adjudicated did not violate the doctrine of separation of powers; and 2) the taking of property that was set aside for the use of the tribe required just compensation, including interest. The Sioux have not accepted the compensation awarded to them by this case, valued at over $1 billion as of 2011.  Facts of the case  The Fort Laramie Treaty of April 29, 1868, pledged that the Great Sioux Reservation, including the Black Hills, would be \\"set apart for the absolute and undisturbed use and occupation of the Indians.\\" (\\"US v Sioux Nation\\"). By the terms of the treaty, cession of any part of the reservation required a new treaty executed and signed by at least three fourths of all the adult male Indians occupying the land.US v Sioux Nation 448 US 371 at 376‚Äì77. The Sioux's right to hunt in some unceded territories were protected by the Fort Laramie Treaty as well. The Fort Laramie Treaty ended the Powder River War of 1866‚Äì1867, a series of military engagements in which the Sioux tribes, led by chief Red Cloud, fought to protect the integrity of earlier-recognized treaty lands from the incursion of white settlers.US v Sioux Nation, 448 U.S. 371, 374. The 1868 treaty brought peace for a few years, but in 1874 an exploratory expedition under General George A. Custer entered the Black Hills to investigate rumors of gold. \\"Custer's florid descriptions of the mineral and timber resources of the Black Hills, and the land's suitability for grazing and cultivation... received wide circulation, and had the effect of creating an intense popular demand for the 'opening' of the Hills for settlement.\\"\\"US v Sioux Nation\\"448 US 371 at 377. Initially the U.S. military tried to turn away trespassing miners and settlers. Eventually however President Grant, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Secretary of War, \\"decided that the military should make no further resistance to the occupation of the Black Hills by miners.\\" These orders were to be enforced \\"quietly,\\" and the President's decision was to remain \\"confidential.\\"\\"US v Sioux Nation\\" 448 US 371 at 378. As more and more settlers and gold miners invaded the Black Hills the Government concluded that the only practical course was to take the land from the Sioux, and appointed a commission to negotiate the purchase.\\"US v Sioux Nation\\" 448 US 371 at 379. The negotiations failed, and so the US resorted to military force. They used as a pretext to declare the Sioux Indians \\"hostile,\\" their failure to obey an order to return from an off-reservation hunting expedition in the dead of winter when travel was impossible.\\"US v Sioux Nation\\" 448 US 371 at 379‚Äì380. The consequent military expedition to remove the Sioux from the Black Hills included an attack on their village on the Little Bighorn River led by General Custer. The attack culminated in the victory of Chiefs Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse over the 7th Cavalry Regiment now known as Custer's Last Stand.'\\"US v Sioux Nation\\" 448 US 371 at 379. That victory was short-lived. Those Indians who survived subsequent battles to surrender to the Army were interned on a reservation, and deprived of their weapons and horses, \\"leaving them completely dependent for survival on rations provided them by the Government.\\"\\"US v Sioux Nation\\" 448 US 371 at 379. In August 1876, Congress enacted a bill cutting off appropriations \\"made for the subsistence\\" of the Sioux, unless they ceded the Black Hills to the United States. A commission headed by George Manypenny presented the Sioux with a new treaty and they signed, under threat of starvation.'\\"US v Sioux Nation\\" 448 US 371 at 381. But only a few leaders signed, not the 3/4 majority of all Indian males on the reservation as required under the Fort Laramie Treaty.'\\"US v Sioux Nation\\" 448 US 371 at 382.  Senate Bill S590 (1876)  After the \\"Army's withdrawal from its role as enforcer of the Fort Laramie Treaty\\" the previous year and its subsequent return to prepare for a military campaign against the Sioux, Bill S590 was introduced to authorize \\"a peaceful settlement\\" with the Sioux Nation for the Black Hills. A proposed \\"five-member commission\\" would have asked the Sioux Nation to relinquish the \\"entire reservation\\" given to them under the Fort Laramie Treaty. From most \\"congressional and pioneer views\\" this was the \\"easy and practical method\\" of securing the Blacks Hills. S590 was approved by the Senate with a vote of thirty to eight, with language that implied that the commission could acquire the entire reservation and relocate the Sioux. In the House Committee on Indian Affairs, it was amended to specify that \\"nothing in this bill could be construed or twisted to allow for the removal of the Sioux Nation to Indian Territory.\\" Peace efforts or \\"attempts to purchase the Blacks hills\\" could still proceed. Missourians praised the action since it would have kept the Sioux far from their borders.U.S., Congress, Wo√ºse, Journal. 44th Cong., 1st sess., 1875-1876, pp. 1050, 1084; U.S., Congress, House, Committee on Indian Affairs, Index of Reports of Committees of the House of Representatives, H.

However, after the Battle of the Little Big Horn public opinion turned against the Sioux and Congress refused to address the bill. When asked why, Congressman Omar Dwight opined that Congress felt the need to ‚Äúfind out whether the Sioux have captured all our army before we go treating with them.‚Äù House Journal, 44 Cong., 1 sess., 1875-1876, p. 1257; House, Congressional Record, 44 Cong,, 1 sess., 1875-1876, 4, pt. 5:4520 S590 went on to die in committee and Congress approved the Indian Appropriations Bill of 1876 instead.

American Indian sovereignty and the US Supreme Court: The masking of justice. University of Texas Press, 2010. 20th century litigation of the Sioux claim for the Black Hills An image of the Black Hills taken from space The Sioux never accepted the legitimacy of the forced deprivation of their Black Hills reservation.\\"US v. Sioux Nation,‚Äù 448 US 371 at 384. In 1920, lobbyists for the Sioux persuaded Congress to authorize a lawsuit against the United States in US Claims Court. The Sioux filed a petition in 1923, but the Claims Court dismissed the case in 1942, holding that the Court could not second guess whether their compensation under the 1877 Agreement reached by the Manypenny Commission ‚Äì which served as the basis for the 1877 Act of Congress -‚Äì was adequate.'\\"US v. Sioux Nation\\" 448 US 371 at 384. The Sioux (and many other tribes) continued lobbying Congress for a forum for their claims, and in 1946 Congress created an independent federal agency, the Indian Claims Commission, to \\"hear and determine all tribal grievances\\" including the Sioux claim.\\"US v. Sioux Nation,\\" 448 US 371 at 385. The Sioux lost their first hearing before the Indian Claims Commission \\"due to the failings of their former counsel,\\" but on appeal to the US Claims Court, the Court directed the Commission to take new evidence, which it did in 1958. Then ensued what the US Supreme Court called \\"a lengthy period of procedural sparring\\" from 1958 until 1972 ‚Äì when the Commission ruled in favor of the Sioux, awarding damages for the deprivation of the land, but not interest. On appeal the Government did not contest the Commission's holding that it had \\"acquired the Black Hills through a course of unfair and dishonorable dealing for which the Sioux were entitled to damages.\\"\\"US v. Sioux Nation,\\" 448 US 371 at 387. In effect, the Government was disputing only whether the Sioux could collect 100 years' worth of interest. The Claims Court ruled that its previous 1942 dismissal of the Sioux‚Äôs Fifth Amendment Taking case was \\"res judicata\\" (a case already decided), \\"whether rightly or wrongly,\\" thus denying the opportunity to seek 100 years' worth of interest.\\"US v. Sioux Nation,\\" 448 US 371 at 388. The case returned to the Indian Claims Commission to determine minor leftover issues about the value of rights-of-way and government offsets. In the meantime, in 1978 the Sioux lobbyists persuaded Congress to pass yet another law conferring authority on the Claims Court to hear the Sioux case, this time without regard to res judicata. That meant the Sioux could re-litigate the claim as a Fifth Amendment Taking, to collect 100 years' worth of interest. Finally, under its new authorizing statute, the Claims Court held the Sioux had suffered a Taking cognizable under the Fifth Amendment, and were entitled to the value of the land as of the 1877 taking which was $17.1 million, the value of gold prospectors illegally took out of the land computed at $450,000, and 100 years' worth of interest at 5% per year which would be an additional $88 million.\\"US v. Sioux Nation,\\" 448 US 371 at 390, footnote 16. This Government appealed this decision, and the US Supreme Court granted its petition for certiorari.  Supreme Court decision  Justice Blackmun delivered the Court's opinion in which six other justices joined. Justice White concurred in part, and Justice Rehnquist dissented.U.S. v. Sioux Nation, 448 U.S. at 373. The issue was whether the Sioux had already received just compensation for their land, and the Court affirmed the Claims Court's decision that they never had.U.S. v. Sioux Nation, 448 U.S. at 420‚Äì21. The Court recognized a tension between Congress's duty to serve as a benevolent trustee for Indians, and the power to take their land.U.S. v. Sioux Nation, 448 U.S. at 408‚Äì09. \\"Congress can own two hats, but it cannot wear them both at the same time,\\" said the opinion.U.S. v. Sioux Nation, 448 U.S. at 408. While reaffirming earlier decisions that Congress has \\"paramount authority over the property of the Indians,\\" the Court concluded that Congress acts properly only if it \\"makes a good faith effort to give the Indians the full value of the land,\\" which here it had failed to do.U.S. v. Sioux Nation, 448 U.S. at 409. In conclusion the Supreme Court ordered \\"just compensation to the Sioux Nation, and that obligation, including an award of interest, must now, at last, be paid.\\"U.S. v. Sioux Nation, 448 U.S. at 423.  Dissent  Associate Justice William Rehnquist was the lone dissenter in this case. Rehnquist felt Congress overstepped the bounds of separation of powers by intruding upon the finality of a judicial decision when it \\"reviewed a prior decision of an Art. III court,A federal court established under Article III of the U.S. Constitution. The Claims Court was not an Article III court at the time it decided the Sioux case in 1942, but became one in 1953 before the 1970s decisions. eviscerated the finality of that judgment, and ordered a new trial in a pending case.\\"'\\"US v Sioux Nation\\" 448 US 371 at 434. Rehnquist also disagreed that the initial Court of Claims decision in 1942 was wrong. He endorsed the view that the Sioux already had been adequately compensated for their land.'\\"US v Sioux Nation\\" 448 US 371 at 434‚Äì35. Rehnquist's dissent suggests that it is \\"quite unfair to judge by the light of 'revisionist' historians or the mores of another era actions that were taken under pressure of time more than a century ago.\\"\\"US v Sioux Nation\\" 448 US 371 at 435. Response to the decision The Sioux have declined to accept the money, because acceptance would legally terminate Sioux demands for return of the Black Hills. The money remains in a Bureau of Indian Affairs account accruing compound interest. , the Sioux‚Äôs award plus interest was \\"about $1 billion\\" or \\"1.3 billion\\" (equivalent to $-$ billion in ). In lieu of accepting the payment outlined by the Court, Sioux leaders created the Black Hills Steering Committee, a political group consisting of members from each Sioux tribe that coalesced around the shared goal of pressuring Congress to enact legislation that would reestablish Sioux sovereignty over the Black Hills territory.Lazarus, Edward. Black Hills / White Justice: The Sioux Nation versus the United States : 1775 to the Present / Edward Lazarus. 1st ed. New York, NY: HarperCollins, 1991. Print Under the leadership of Gerald Clifford, the designated coordinator of legislative efforts, Sioux representatives spent two years negotiating the exact terms of their demands. The final legislative draft written by the Steering Committee called for the creation of a new reservation within the same territory acquired by the United States in 1877 that once constituted the Great Sioux Reservation, and totaled an approximate 7.3 million acres. However, the Sioux would only receive direct title over 1.2 million acres of federal land, as the State of South Dakota and private residents were permitted to retain ownership over their land. The legislation would also re-establish water and mineral rights to the Sioux in the reapportioned territory and restore tribal jurisdiction. It also included provisions that ensured the exemption of the territory under Sioux control from all federal, local, and state taxes.'Wicazo Sa Review, Vol. 4, No. 1, A Case Study: The Black Hills Issue: A Call for Reform (Spring, 1988), pp. 13-17 The Steering Committee succeeded in bringing this legislation to Congress when Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey signed on as a sponsor and introduced it on July 17, 1985. The new Sioux Nation Black Hills Act, or \\"Bradley Bill\\" as it was more commonly known, was staunchly opposed by the South Dakota delegation. The bill ultimately died in Congress without ever being brought up for a vote. Bradley tried to reintroduce the legislation in 1987; however, internal political divisions amongst the representatives on the Black Hills Steering Committee diffused the momentum behind it. Steering Committee member Red Cloud proposed that the new legislative effort be led by Phil Stevens, a businessman from California who claimed Sioux ancestry, instead of Clifford.Gonzalez, Mario, and Cook-Lynn, Elizabeth. The Politics of Hallowed Ground: Wounded Knee and the Struggle for Indian Sovereignty / Mario Gonzalez and Elizabeth Cook-Lynn. Urbana: U of Illinois, 1999. Print. Stevens claimed that the Bradley Bill was not sufficient and demanded in addition to the restoration of 1.3 million acres of territory, a sum of $3.1 billion in compensation and the guarantee of future rents on an additional 73 million acres that were included in the original Treaty of 1868 at a value of one dollar per acre to be paid each year.Gregg, PR, II. \\"Town Forum Suggests Sharp Division Among Sioux Tribal Members.\\" Indian Country Today (1983-1988), Sep 20, 1988, p.1. https://search.proquest.com/docview/371473745 Stevens‚Äô proposal earned him widespread support among many Sioux representatives. However, others in the Clifford camp were wary and criticized him for focusing too much on money rather than the return of Sioux land. Senator Bradley decided to hold back on the new bill until a resolution was reached for this internal dispute. Ultimately, Stevens proved unable to secure any congressional support behind his alternative proposal, and the momentum behind the initial push behind the Bradley Bill was lost.

It is the most destructive nematode pest of turf grass, and it also attacks a wide range of fruit, vegetable, and fiber crops such as citrus, cotton, ornamentals, and forage. The sting nematode is a migratory ectoparasite of roots. It is well established in many golf courses and presents a problem in turf management. The sting nematode is only present in very sandy soils. It cannot reproduce in heavier or clay soils. History  The genus was originally described by Steiner in 1942 but because of WWII the work was not published until 1949 (B. gracilis, Steiner 1949). Then Rau (1958) further refined the anatomical description and clarified the genus to note that there were several species, most common of which is B. longicaudatus. Description A long nematode compared to other plant parasitic nematodes at 2‚Äì3 mm for both the male and female. Description: The lip region is hemispherical, divided bilateral, dorsal, and ventral with grooves into 4 main lobes (2 subdorsal and 2 subventral) each bearing 6 or more horizontal striations; two smaller lobes (lateral) with amphid apertures. The lip region is generally set off from the body by deep constriction, but this may be less marked in some populations. The lateral field is marked by a single incisure extending from the base of the lip region to near the tail terminus. The stylet is 100-140 micrometers long; it is very thin and flexible with rounded knobs. The excretory pore is posterior to median bulb. The esophageal gland is lobe-like and extends anteriorly over the intestine. The tail is 115-189 micrometers long with a rounded terminus. Males: Outline of lip region is more flattened at the sides than in females but arrangement of lobes is similar. The testis is outstretched. Spicules are arcuate with ventral flanges and the distal ends pointed with small apical notches. The gubernaculum is well developed and there is a bursa enveloping the tail. Female: The vulva is a transverse slit and the vulval lips do not protrude into the vagina which generally has an opposing pair of sclerotized pieces in the lateral view. There are two ovaries which are amphidelphic and outstretched. There is also a spermatheca present. (CIH: Set 3 No. 40.1974) Distribution and economic importance Sting nematodes are endemic to the southeastern United States and are only capable of reproducing in sandy soils. This fact is the primary limiting factor in this nematodes distribution. The nematode has been reported in all the southeastern gulf states and additionally in Kansas, Oklahoma, New Jersey, Connecticut and Arkansas (Robbins and Barker, 1974). More recently it has been reported as a pest in Californian golf courses due to the transport of infested root stock. It is a major pest of golf courses (Luc et al. 2010) strawberries (Noling 2012) cotton (Crow et al. 2005), corn (Perry and Rhodes, 1982) and citrus (Duncan et al. 1996). The large size of the nematode paired with its ability to repeatedly feed from site to site on the root system of many crops makes this a formidable pest. Reduction of yield and substantial reduction in plant size have been reported for multiple crops. Reproduction & Life Cycle  The life cycle is around 24‚Äì28 days with optimum temperature being 25-30 C (Huang and Becker, 1999 & Robbins and Barker, 1974). The nematode survives extremes in temperature or drought by moving deeper into the soil (Robbins and Barker, 1974). All vermiform life stages feed on roots and feeding is required to mate and reproduce. Females must be fertilized by a male for viable eggs to be produced (Huang and Becker, 1999). Host Parasite Relationship  The nematode feeds as an ectoparasite, most often at the site of cell division and elongation of the root (Huang and Becker, 1997). The long stylet allows the nematode to feed on the inner cortex and endodermis. The feeding at root tips causes root abbreviation and stunting (Crow and Han, 2005). In corn roots swelling at root tips may occur due to repeated attempts by the plant to produce new root branches. In cotton the feeding may cause lesions which eventually cause root girdling. Management Historically, methyl bromide has been the chemical most often used to control sting nematodes however its scheduled removal from the market on January 1, 2015 (Rosskoph et al. 2005) has led to testing of new chemicals and biopesticides. Endospores of Pasturia sp. have been tested on turf grass with mixed success (Luc et al.2010). The extensive use of various chemicals in the strawberry and turf grass industries offers excellent insight into the future of chemical control of nematodes which will surely involve a multifaceted approach. The leading candidate for most control is Telone (Noling 2012). Crop rotation is generally viewed as economically prohibitive due to the pests wide host range Host list  Host list from: Noling, J.W.

Sorghum is also a popular cover crop restoring large amounts of soil organic matter, but is a good host for sting nematode but not root-knot.

Biography  Viktoriya Tokareva was born in 1937 in Leningrad, in the Soviet Union. Her love for literature began at the age of twelve, when her mother read her \\"Skripka Rotschil'da\\" (‚ÄúRothschild‚Äôs Violin‚Äù), a short story by Chekhov.See e.g. Richard Chapple, \\"Happily Never After,\\" in Fruits of Her Plume. Ed. Helena Goscilo. Armonk: M.E. Sharpe, 1993. 185-204 However, this love for literature did not immediately translate into a desire to be a writer ‚Äì as a young woman, Tokareva initially applied to study medicine. When her application was rejected, she decided to study music instead, spending four years studying piano at the Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov Saint Petersburg Conservatory. In this, too, Tokareva was unsuccessful. Realizing that she would never become a musician, she found work as a music teacher instead, in a school on the outskirts of Moscow. However, this did not suit her either, and Tokareva decided to become an actress, enrolling in the State Institute of Cinematography in 1963. It was here that she discovered her talent as a writer and found her niche as a screenwriter. In her second year at the Institute, Tokareva published her first short story, ‚ÄúDen bez vran'ya,‚Äù or \\"A Day Without Lying,‚Äù in the literary magazine Molodaya Gvardiya. She has been writing steadily ever since. Her books to date include Happy End (1995), Vmesto menya (Instead of Me) (1995), and Loshadi s kryl'yami (Horses with Wings) (1996), and she has published often in the journals Novy mir and Yunost. Tokareva‚Äôs characters tend to be ordinary people facing ordinary problems ‚Äì people to whom her readers can easily relate. The majority of her characters are women, and as such she is regarded primarily as a women‚Äôs writer. Her writing can on occasion seem moralistic, upholding traditional values and gender roles, which has led to Western critics labeling her ‚Äúpre-feminist.‚Äù Although she writes mainly in the realist tradition, she sometimes dips into what she calls \\"fantastic realism,\\" weaving magical events into accounts of everyday lives. Critical responses Viktoriya Tokareva's writing style is often compared to that of Anton Chekhov, whom she has acknowledged as one of her main influences.See e.g. Richard Chapple, A Note on Viktoria Tokareva and Anton Chekhov, in the Journal of the Australian and New Zealand Slavists' Association and of the Australasian Association, No. 6 1992. Another influence may be Sergei Dovlatov, whom Tokareva has claimed is her favorite contemporary Russian writer. Critical response to Tokareva has been varied, with some Russian critics dismissing her as just another female writer, and critics abroad seeing her as a non-feminist writer less talented than the other popular female Russian writers: Lyudmila Ulitskaya, Tatyana Tolstaya, and Lyudmila Petrushevskaya. There has been little critical work conducted on Tokareva's work in the West thus far, although she is often mentioned by Helena Goscilo in her work on Russian female writing,See e.g. Helena Goscilo, Dehexing Sex : Russian Womanhood During and After Glasnost, Ann Arbor : University of Michigan Press, 1996. and by Richard Chapple. Work in film Tokareva began working with various Russian film directors starting in the late 1960s. To date, she has written fourteen screenplays, several of which were adapted from her short stories or books, including Sto gram dlya khrabrosti or 100 Grams for Bravery (1976) and Talisman (1983). Three of her films - Mimino (1977), Dzhentlmeny udachi, or Gentlemen of Fortune (1972), and Shla sobaka po royalyu, or A Dog was Walking on the Piano (1978) ‚Äì were quite successful, with Mimino winning a gold medal at the 1977 Moscow International Film Festival. Current information Viktoryia Tokareva lives in Moscow, where she continues to write. Her work has been translated into English and is available in several anthologies as well as in The Talisman and Other Stories - a book of Tokareva's short stories translated by Rosamund Bartlett.

Its name and original boundaries were taken from the Jordan Stake of the LDS Church, which at the time spanned the breadth of the Salt Lake Valley from east to west, and the length of the valley from roughly Midvale to the south end of the valley. To the north was the Granite School District, named after the Granite Stake of the LDS Church, which was divided predominantly from the Jordan district along 6400 South from the Wasatch Mountain Range to the Oquirh Mountains. A number of older students in Bennion (now Taylorsville) elected to attend high school at Jordan High during the period of 1920-60 or later. Split When Jordan's east-side communities voted to break from the district and form their own, Jordan lost 44 of its 84 schools and a large part of its property tax base. This split caused a loss in property tax revenue; together with $16 million in state budget cuts, this created budget problems for the district. As of August 13, 2009, the district faced a $33 million shortfall. Jordan teachers lost nine days' pay, and were paid an average of 4.5 percent less in the 2009-2010 school year than they were paid in 2008-2009, and taxpayers faced a large property tax increase. Continuing budget fallout In early 2010, the Jordan district school board announced a $20 million shortfall caused by the loss of taxable property, and announced cuts that could slash teacher ranks, increase class sizes and impact extracurricular activities. On February 22, 2010, the board of education of the district had a meeting that turned into a protest, with hundreds of students saying \\"save our teachers!\\" Hundreds of students from several Jordan district schools walked out of their classes on February 24, 2010, to demonstrate at district headquarters over the announced budget cuts. In 2015, the Washington Post reported that of the nation's largest school districts, the Jordan School District spent the least per student, $5,708. Utah is the state with the lowest spending per student, $6,555.

It is located off the motorway from M√°laga to Granada and Seville. It is situated in the northeast of the province. It belongs to the comarca of Nororma. The white washed pueblo sits at the base of the Cerro de la Cruz, with rolling countryside on the other three sides. Famous for the quality of its olive oil, the countryside is naturally clothed with olive trees and wheat fields in between. The population is approximately 3,500. The feria is celebrated during the first week in August, and is known as \\"La Veladilla del Carmen\\". There is another feria in October to celebrate the patron called the \\"La Virgen del Rosario\\". Festivities however start earlier in the year on April 25 when the population, in common with other agricultural communities celebrate \\"La Romeria de San Marcos\\" who is the patron saint of the countryside. The pueblo acts as a base for potholers whot can explore the caverns in the Sierra, or for cycling horse riding or walking holidays. Several properties are available for 'rural tourism'. History The original village dates back to 1812 when it obtained its independence from Archidona, protected by Royal Decree from the Courts of C√°diz, and was called Puebla del Saucedo. The inhabitants of Archidona opposed this both bitterly and violently so that eventually the new village had to turn to the Council of the King's Chambers where the dispute was finally settled in 1827. Three years later the village changed its name to Villanueva del Rosario. The area was originally inhabited by Romans, who were followed by Arabic and Visigoth settlements by the river bank. It is said that the important Roman city of Ulisis was situated here on the area known as Pe√±on de Solis. It is rumoured that treasure lies below the peak but no one has ever found it. Many Roman roads are still in existence, and a number of object including coins, bracelets, glass and ceramic fragments, have been found in the area. The town centre was founded in the eighteenth century, it is said due to the abundance of willow trees (which still exist), and encouraged the settlement of Saucedo. Today the residents are still known as Sauceda√±os. The two Copper Age archaeological sites in the municipality can be found at the Finca Tard√≥n and the other is in the Pe√±on del Oso mountain area. Places to visit The Copper Era sites and the Visigoth necropolis (burial grounds) are found in the hills, but most of them have been robbed or partially destroyed. The shrine built in honour of the villages patron saint \\"La Virgen del Rosario\\" is situated above the village on the way to \\"El Nacimiento\\", a spring at the base of the mountain which supplies the village with drinking water. Continuing upwards the Hondoneros is reached high on the Sierra los Camarolos and Sierra Gorda, where many different species of flora and fauna can be found.

With an elevation listed at either or , it is the product of subduction of several tectonic plates under the North American Plate, which continues at a rate of each year. Big Cave has a basaltic composition, with a rough surface texture, and has been covered by lava flows. Located between Big Lake to the north and Bald Mountain to the south, it forms part of a belt of Late Quaternary volcanoes moving north from the Lassen Peak volcano. It last erupted either during the late Pleistocene or Holocene epoch; its exact age is unknown. It does not possess any major subfeatures besides young pyroclastic cones on its northern flank and on its summit.  Geography  Big Cave lies to the south of Big Lake but north of Bald Mountain. Sources differ on its exact height, listing an elevation of or .  Geology  The Cascade Range has been active for about 36 million years, largely as a result of the subduction through convergence of the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate with the North American Plate, which persists at a rate of annually. Cascade volcanism has occurred intermittently; there are volcanic rocks that are probably unrelated to subduction dating to between 55 million and 42 million years ago, with the most recent activity starting roughly 5 million years ago. In the Cascade Volcanic Arc, volcanism during the Holocene epoch spans the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt in southern British Columbia in Canada to the Lassen Peak volcanic complex in northern California. However, along the arc, volcanism shows profound differences. South of Crater Lake in Oregon, the belt bends in southeastern direction until reaching Lassen Peak. The eastern boundary of the Southern Cascades known as the Hat Creek Graben region is cut by many faults and incorporates several tectonic provinces and volcanoes. It also resides at the transition zone between the subducting Gorda tectonic plate, which is also moving under the North American Plate, the Klamath Mountain Region where the Earth's crust is shortening, and an area of normal faults. In this region, more than 500 volcanic vents have erupted in the past 7 million years. In California, volcanoes like Lassen Peak and Mount Shasta occur among rings of mafic (rich in magnesium and iron) shield volcanoes and volcanic fields such as the Medicine Lake Volcano. Big Cave lies at the northern end of a belt of late, Quaternary volcanoes moving north from Lassen Peak. It is a small shield volcano, likely formed during the Holocene epoch, though scientists from the United States Geological Survey are unsure. It could also be from the late Pleistocene epoch; M. A. Clynne thought it may be of similar age to the nearby Cinder Butte volcano, at 38,000 ¬± 7,000 years. The volcano consists of basaltic lava and has pyroclastic cones at its summit and northern side. It has a low, \\"inconspicuous\\" profile, and is surrounded by a large lava field. Covered with lava flows, it also has a rough surface, and lacks any other major known subfeatures.

Peretz, he began writing in 1904 and gained recognition for his 1906 masterpiece \\"A Shtetl\\" (A Town). This novella, still regarded as his major achievement, was a literary response to a story by Sholem Asch called \\"The Shtetl\\". Unlike Asch's sentimental view of Eastern European Jewish unity in the waning years of the Russian Empire, Weissenberg used a naturalistic form to explore the deep divides between Jews, usually along class lines. In the process, he \\"stressed the impact of the new revolutionary doctrines upon the townlets, rousing them from their lethargy and shattering their foundations\\" (Liptzin, p. 257). (See Shtetl for more on the history of these towns). \\"Almost alone among Yiddish writers, Weissenberg was a worker and the son of workers,\\" critic Ruth Wisse notes (p. 27), a fact which shaped both his subject matter and his use of language. He wrote several novels and plays, but remained a consistently strong writer of novellas and short stories. Weissenberg's grave at the Okopowa Street Jewish Cemetery, next to Hersh Dovid Nomberg After the death of Peretz in 1915, Weissenberg became a major force in Polish Yiddish publishing, taking over Peretz's role as promoter of young talent and editor and publisher of periodicals and books. He expended much of his energy during the 1920s and 1930s in fighting battles within Yiddish-speaking Warsaw, even refusing a literary prize awarded him by the local Jewish community. He was particularly opposed to the dominance of \\"Litvaks\\" (Jews of Lithuania and other regions where the same dialect of Yiddish is spoken) in communal and literary life. Part of his opposition to this dominance took the form of his introduction of many local Polish-Yiddish terms in his writing, now considered a particularly attractive feature of his writing, as well as a unique orthography based on Polish-Yiddish pronunciation. His funeral in 1938 attracted thousands of mourners from among his reading public. Because of the class consciousness which marks Weissenberg's central theme, his work was republished in post-War Communist Poland. A nice edition of his best work, edited by his daughter Pearl Weissenberg, was published in Chicago in 1959. Although various of his stories have been translated for anthologies (see, e.g., the Wisse anthology below), no book-length translation of his work is available in English.

As of October 2017, the project has been unmaintained with a number of unresolved issues, and the project's website is offline. Kloxo allows the host administrators to run a combination of lighttpd or Apache with djbdns or BIND, and provides a graphical interface to switch between these programs without losing data. Kloxo Enterprise can transparently move web/mail/dns from one server running Apache to another running lighttpd. It was formerly considered to be a good free alternative to cPanel hosting control panel. Kloxo comes integrated with Installapp, which is a bundle of approximately 130 web applications that can be installed to the hosted websites. It is supported by Installatron  a third party application installer (similar to Fantastico) as a plugin. As of October 2017 the whole LxCenter website appears to be down with only the GitHub repository (and some forks) remaining with the last notable changes being 3 years old.  Lxadmin/Kloxo name change  Security issues  In early June 2009, security related blogs and websites posted details of security loopholes in LxAdmin/Kloxo. Around this time, another piece of software created by the same vendor - HyperVM - was rumored to have been exploited in a massive attack at the British VAserv budget webhosting company. Crackers deleted the content of 100,000 hosted websites in one go, after gaining root access to the system. A detailed timeline of these events was posted several months later. It is widely acknowledged by the hacker(s) and parties involved that the core exploit had to do with the administrator of those VPS's reusing the same password on all installs, and not utilizing the SSL security feature. Experts believe that this led to the transmission of the password in plain text, allowing hackers to sniff and exploit the host. Since then, it has since been discovered that only a few security vulnerabilities were existent in both products, which have since been patched. In early 2012 the message \\"DO NOT INSTALL THESE APPS. The applications included in InstallApp are outrageously out of date, and contain known and public security vulnerabilities. Enabling this feature on a live server exposes your server and users to serious security flaws\\" showed prominently at the top of the InstallApp page. This message was still there in early late January 2014. In late 2012, a local privilege escalation exploit was found in Kloxo's lxsuexec and lxrestart programs, allowing an attacker to elevate privileges to root.  Project history  While Kloxo initially started as a proprietary control panel, Internal issues arose within the company after the death of its CEO. It was later announced on July 10, 2009, that Kloxo and HyperVM would be continued in an open source consortium to be formed by Arthur Thornton, Danny Terweij, and S Bhargava. However, on October 25, 2009, Arthur Thornton officially resigned as the lead developer of Kloxo and HyperVM. Following his resignation, the HyperVM and Kloxo source code was officially released to the public. Arthur Thornton resumed his work on Kloxo and HyperVM in the background in mid- February 2010. As of May 2010, he is now back in the public and should soon be back full-time, though not as lead developer. Andre Allen became Project Manager at LxCenter in late February 2010, at the decision of Danny Terweij. A fork of the project was created by Mustafa Ramadhan, entitled Kloxo_MR. Work was begun in late 2012 to add extra features to the project.

It was discovered in 1997, and scientifically described in 1999. Description The jocotoco antpitta is a large (150‚Äì200 g) antpitta with a striking head pattern showing tufts of white plumes beneath the eyes. It has a song similar to the hooting of the rufous-banded owl. Taxonomy Its closest relatives appear to be the chestnut-naped antpitta and the pale- billed antpitta, with which it forms a group of antpittas with uniform breast plumage and smoky-grey flanks. This bird's specific name honors the ornithologist Robert S. Ridgely, who took part in the initial discovery of this species. The common name refers to the local name of the bird, jocotoco, which is onomatopoetic after its hooting calls and song. Distribution and habitat The antpitta is known only from a very small number of locations in southeastern Ecuador and adjacent Peru, and appears to be declining. It was believed to be limited to the upper Chinchipe River drainage in Zamora- Chinchipe, Ecuador, but in 2006 a population was discovered in Cordillera del C√≥ndor in Cajamarca, Peru. It inhabits only wet, mossy forest with ample Chusquea bamboo stands and silvery-leaved Cecropia trees. It is found at altitudes of 2,250 to 2,700 meters. Conservation and status To protect the presumably small population, the Tapichalaca Biological Reserve was established on behalf of Fundaci√≥n de Conservaci√≥n Jocotoco in 1998. The IUCN classifies it as endangered (B1ab(i, ii, iii, v)). This means that based on available data, it is estimated to occur in no more than five locations over a total area of less than 5000 km¬≤, with both habitat quality and availability, and numbers declining, and some of the subpopulations in danger of disappearance. Owing to its shyness and the call, which might be mistaken for that of a rufous-banded owl, it could be more widespread than now known, although surveys at several seemingly appropriate localities have failed to find any evidence of it.

It was inactivated on 1 October 1993. History=World War II : See 350th Fighter Group for extended World War II history The group's air echelon was activated in England under Eighth Air Force. It was equipped with export versions of the P-39 Airacobra originally ordered for the French Air Force. By the summer of 1942 the number of American pilot volunteers in the Royal Air Force serving in England had grown to a few hundred in number. In urgent need of additional fighters to support the forthcoming North African invasion, American planners decided to combine these two assets already in England and at the end of September 1942 a number of American pilots in the RAF were invited to transfer to the USAAF. Deployed from England to Port Lyautey Airfield, French Morocco, during the period 3 Jan to 28 February 1943. The Ground Echelon, finally joined each other at Oujda Airfield, French Morocco, a few days after their arrival in North Africa on 3 January 1943. The Ground Echelon had arrived off North Africa in the first week of November 1942 from the United States with the Operation Torch invasion fleet. The group operated with Twelfth Air Force from January 1943 until the end of the war, flying patrol and interception missions, protecting convoys, escorting aircraft, flying reconnaissance missions, engaging in interdiction operations, and providing close support for ground forces. It operated against targets in Tunisia until the end of that campaign. The Group flew air defense and fighter- bomber missions with its P-39 Airacobras and primarily fighter bomber missions with its P-47 Thunderbolts. The 350th FG moved to the port of embarkation at Naples, Italy, on 14 July 1945. On 1 August 1945, the group sailed for combat operations in the Pacific Theater. The atomic bombs were dropped on Japan while the Group was en route and provisioning in Panama City on the Pacific Ocean side of the Canal Zone. V-J day was declared, signaling the end of hostilities in World War II. The ship carrying the Group was directed to return to the US and the 350th Fighter Group and its American Squadrons were inactivated on 7 November 1945, at Seymour Johnson Field, Goldsboro, NC, after 3 years and one month of operations. The inactivation was to last less than a year. Pennsylvania Air National Guard 112th Fighter Group F-47N 44-8913 at Pittsburgh Airport F-51D of the 148th Fighter Squadron, Reading Pennsylvania ANG, 1955. F-102A 57-0847, 146th FIS, about 1970 146th TFS A-7D 72-0232 The wartime 350th Fighter Group was re-designated as the 112th Fighter Group and was allotted to the Pennsylvania Air National Guard on 24 May 1946. It was organized at the Greater Pittsburgh Airport and was extended federal recognition on 22 April 1949 by the National Guard Bureau. The 112th Fighter Group was bestowed the history, honors, and colors of the 350th Fighter Group. The wartime 345th FS became the 146th Fighter Squadron, the 346th FS became the 147th Fighter Squadron and the 347th FS was re-designated the 148th Fighter Squadron, and assigned to Spaatz Field at Reading. The 146th and 147th would have an air defense mission over Pittsburgh and western Pennsylvania; the 148th would fly air defense over the Philadelphia and eastern Pennsylvania. The Pittsburgh squadrons flew F-47N Thunderbolts and the 148th FS at Reading flew F-51D Mustangs. The group was assigned to the PA ANG 53d Fighter Wing In February 1951 the 148th FS at Reading was activated for the Korean War, along with the 111th Bombardment Group at Philadelphia, leaving the 112th and the 146th and 147th Fighter Squadrons at Pittsburgh with the air defense mission for the entire commonwealth. At the end of 1951, the activated units at Reading and Philadelphia returned to Pennsylvania control. The F-47s were retired and the squadrons re-equipped with F-51H Mustangs, due to the lack of jets which were being used in Korea. After the Korean War ended, originally it was planned to convert the 146th FBS from its propeller-driven F-51Hs to F-86A Sabre jet interceptors, but after receiving four Sabres, the squadron began to receive new F-84F Thunderstreaks in October 1954. The 147th switched from its F-51Hs to F-84Fs in July 1955. In July 1955, the group was again re-designated, this time as the 112th Fighter-Interceptor Group, reflecting the Pennsylvania ANG's mission to counter the threat of Soviet bombers. In December 1957, the 146th replaced their F-84Fs with F-86D Sabre Interceptors, and the 147th followed in early 1958 receiving F-86L Sabre Interceptors. At Reading, by 1956 the 148th Fighter Squadron F-51Ds were reaching the end of their service life and the Air Force was phasing the Mustang out of the inventory. In an effort to upgrade to an all jet fighter force, the Air Force required Air National Guard Air Defense Command units to upgrade to jet-powered aircraft. Tests of operating F-84Fs at Spaatz Field had shown that the runways at the airport were too short to operate jet fighters safely from the runways, and the Reading Airport Commission and Air National Guard authorities found themselves in a conflict over the use of Reading Municipal Airport for tactical jet operations. Unable to resolve these differences the Air Force inactivated the 148th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron on 30 June 1956. It was subsequently re- designated the 140th Aeromedical Transport Squadron and reactivated at Spaatz Field as a new organization of the PA ANG, equipped with propeller-driven C-46 Commandos. The 148th's its lineage and history were bestowed on the new squadron. With the inactivation of the 148th, the 103d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at Philadelphia took up the air defense mission of the eastern part of the commonwealth. Beginning in 1960, the 112th Fighter Interceptor Group upgraded to the supersonic F-102A Delta Dagger interceptor. These Air Guard pilots stood runway alert for 24 hours a day, seven days a week at the Greater Pittsburgh Airport ready to scramble regardless of the weather conditions to intercept any unidentified aircraft approaching southward from the Canada‚ÄìUS border or toward the United States from the Atlantic Coast, their F-102A Delta Daggers fully armed with two heat seeking missiles and four radar-guided missiles as well as 2.75-inch rockets. With air defense becoming less critical in the early 1960s, the 103d FIS at Philadelphia moved to an Air Transport mission in 1962. In February 1961, the 171st Air Transport Group was formed at Greater Pittsburgh Airport flying the C-121 Constellation as a component of the Military Air Transport Service (MATS). Upon formation, the 147th Fighter- Interceptor Squadron was reassigned from the 112th FIG and re-designated as the 147th Air Transport Squadron, becoming the operational squadron of the new 171st ATG. The 146th FIS remained with the 112th FIG at Pittsburgh thus became the last Air Defense squadron in the PA Air National Guard. In 1975 the 112th ended its air defense mission, receiving its first A-7D Corsair II aircraft and was reassigned to the Tactical Air Command. In 1991 with the retirement of the A-7D, the 112th Tactical Fighter Group became the 112th Air Refueling Group (ARG) under Strategic Air Command, receiving KC-135 Stratotankers that it operated jointly with the 171st, which had become an air refueling Wing at Pittsburgh in October 1972. Strategic Air Command was inactivated in June 1992 and the 112th ARG became a part of the Air Mobility Command (AMC). On 1 October 1993, with both the 112th Air Refueling Group and the 171st Air Refueling Wing at Pittsburgh, the two tanker units were consolidated with the 146th Air Refueling Squadron being reassigned to the 171st Operations Group and once again reuniting with the 147th under the same group. The 112th Air Refueling Group was inactivated.

The stone was mined locally as part of a conscious effort to blend the building with its mountainous surroundings. The southern facade of the same building has a strikingly oriental appearance. The Vorontsov Palace (; ) or the Alupka Palace is a historic palace situated at the foot of the Crimean Mountains near the town of Alupka in Crimea. The Vorontsov Palace is one of the oldest and largest palaces in Crimea, and is one of the most popular tourist attractions on Crimea's southern coast. The palace was built between 1828 and 1848 for Russian Prince Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov for use as his personal summer residence at a cost of 9 million silver rubles. It was designed in a loose interpretation of the English Renaissance revival style by English architect Edward Blore and his assistant William Hunt. The building is a hybrid of several architectural styles, but faithful to none. Among those styles are elements of Scottish Baronial, Indo-Saracenic Revival Architecture,Brett, p? and Gothic Revival architecture. Blore had designed many buildings in the United Kingdom, and was later particularly well known there for completing the design of Buckingham Palace in London. Once completed, the palace was visited by many members of the Russian Empire's elite ruling class; a great number of these vastly wealthy nobles were so taken with the palace and its seaboard site that they were moved to create their own summer retreats in the Crimea. By the early 20th century not only many aristocrats, but also members of the Imperial Family, including the Tsar himself, had palaces in an assortment of architectural styles in the vicinity. An important feature of the Vorontsov Palace is the adjoining park ensemble, which features of greenery and forestry arranged by German landscape gardener Carolus Keebach. Today, the Vorontsov Palace is a part of the \\"Alupka Palace-Park Complex,\\" a national historical preserve including the Massandra Palace in neighbouring Massandra. Owing to its status as an important local tourist attraction and architectural monument, the Vorontsov Palace and its surrounding park complex were frequently featured in Ukrainian and Soviet cinema productions such as: An Ordinary Miracle (1964), Nebesnye lastochki (1976), Crazy Day or The Marriage of Figaro (2004), and Sappho (2008). Russian poet Ivan Bunin visited the palace in 1900 and wrote a short poem entitled \\"Long alley leading down to the shore ...\\" (). History In the 1820s, Russian noblemen commissioned a number of Palladian residences in Novorossiya, primarily in Odessa. In the period following the Napoleonic wars, the new city of Odessa emerged as Russia's southern capital with a vibrant cosmopolitan society centred on a handful of Russian aristocrats and Polish women such as Zofia Potocka and Karolina Rzewuska. According to Filipp Vigel, the viceroy's court in Odessa looked like a \\"small capital of an imperial f√ºrst\\". While many Neoclassical buildings appeared in Odessa, the Crimea (or Taurica, as it was then better known) was still perceived as a wild, exotic hinterland. The mid-1820s saw the appearance of highly popular Romantic works celebrating its rugged beauty, such as Alexander Pushkin's poem The Fountain of Bakhchisaray and Adam Mickiewicz's Crimean Sonnets. Both poets were fascinated with Lord Byron's Oriental romances and pictured the Crimea as an exotic land of Tartar Muslim traditions which had flourished in the Khanate of Crimea until its demise in 1783. Mikhail Vorontsov was appointed Viceroy of Novorossiya in May 1823. Even before their arrival in Odessa, the Vorontsovs started buying up lands in the southwest of Crimea, which was sparsely populated and little known at the time. Alupka was bought in 1824 from colonel Theodosios Reveliotis, the owner of Livadia and Oreanda.–ï. –ò. –ò–Ω–¥–æ–≤–∞. –ö—Ä–µ–ø–æ—Å—Ç–Ω–æ–µ —Ö–æ–∑—è–π—Å—Ç–≤–æ –≤ –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª–µ XIX –≤–µ–∫–∞.

Original design and ethos Mikhail Vorontsov (1782‚Äì1856) commissioned the palace for use as his own summer residence. The Vorontsov Palace was commissioned as a summer residence for the Governor-General of Novorossiya, Prince Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov (born 1782 ‚Äì died 1856). The Prince was a dedicated Anglophile. His father, Semyon Vorontsov, had been Catherine the Great's ambassador to England, and the Prince had been educated in London. His sister, Catherine, had married an English aristocrat and become the ch√¢telaine of one of England's grandest country houses, Wilton House. On the accession of Paul I, in 1796, Semyon Vorontsov fell from favour and his estates confiscated and not returned until 1801, after the accession of Alexander 1. It is therefore unsurprising that he chose to reside with his daughter in England until his death and that Mikhail Vorontsov was a frequent visitor to that country. Vorontsov had been purchasing land from the local Tartars for the site of his new palace at Alupka from 1823; however, the acquisition had been part of a deal which necessitated Vorontsov to build a new mosque. Part of the site had already been planted with fine trees in 1787 for Prince Potemkin by the English landscape gardener William Gould as part of Potemkin's \\"improvements\\" to the area in perpetration of a visitation by Catherine the Great following Potemkin's bloodless annexation of the Crimea to Russia. On acquiring ownership of the site, Vorontsov immediately employed the German gardener Karl Kebach to further improve the site and layout the grounds and gardens for the proposed new palace. Thomas Harrison's abandoned classical design for the garden facade centred on an exedra; this feature was to be retained in the new plan. In 1824, the architect Philip Elson was commissioned to build a small house for the Vorontsov family to inhabit while the new palace was under construction. Now much altered in form, and known as the Asiatic Pavilion, this building still stands. Originally, the prince wanted a strictly Classical design, and plans for such a design were executed, in Chester by architect Thomas Harrison and modified, on site, by Odessa architect Francesco Boffo. The two architects had previously worked together on the design for Vorontsov's official residence in Odessa. Harrison's plans for he palace at Alupka show a classical villa on the site of the present palace's corps de logis with bedroom floors below, on what are now the lower terraces of the present palace. On the garden front, facing the sea, the plans show a large double height classical exedra; Vorontsov must have approved of this concept as it was the only feature (albeit transformed to an Islamic style), to be incorporated from Harrison's plans into the new plans. Construction began in 1828, however, it was suspended in June 1831 before the building has risen from its foundations. This may have been because the principal architect Harrison had died the previous year and Boffo working alone may not have been an option ‚Äì his alterations to Harrison's plans for the Governor's residence in Odessa had been unfavourably received. Change of plan Vorontsov had traveled widely in England, and had doubtless seen the newly emerging, but retrospective, Jacobethan style of architecture ‚Äì a hybrid revival styles based on the English buildings of the late 16th and early 17th centuries, which, in turn, had been influenced by the English Renaissance style which had belatedly evolved from the Italian Renaissance style of a century earlier. Vorontsov decided to review the design in order to incorporate these new trends from Western European architecture. This major change from a Classical design to a far more complex revival style, little known in Russia, meant Vorontsov had to find an alternative architect to execute a new design. This was further complicated by Vorontsov's desire to not only have a loose Jacobean style, but also to incorporate motifs from Islamic architecture so as to highlight the oriental strain evident in the Khan's Palace, Enikale Fort, and other local Tatar architecture. The resulting design was to highlight the Crimea's position as a place where the East and West meet. It was a radical departure from the Neoclassical strain that dominated the Russian architecture of the period. As a result of the expansion of the British Empire, a similar approach was also gaining popularity in Britain. An Anglicised interpretation of Islamic architecture is exemplified by the Brighton Royal Pavilion, completed in 1823, and the Sezincote House, completed a few years earlier. Both these buildings drew heavily on the Islamic motifs, which were later to be evident at the Vorontsov Palace and were new and novel designs at the time of the Prince's visit to England. Vorontsov decided upon the British architect Edward Blore to redesign and complete the building. Blore was a curious choice of architect; though able his work has often been often considered bland and uninspired. The eminent architectural historian Howard Colvin claimed that \\"a dull competence pervaded all his work\\", while the country house architectural expert Mark Girouard has described Blore as \\"a bit of a bore.\\" Colvin, p30Girouard, p51. However, Blore's stolid and conventional designs were admired by the English Tory aristocracy ‚Äì a class to which Vorontsov's sister belonged and for whom Blore had worked at Wilton. The Anglophile Vorontsov was also a great admirer and friend of Sir Walter Scott for whom Blore had worked at the great Scottish baronial country house Abbotsford; therefore it seems likely that these latter connections led Vorontsov to Blore. Blore had already worked on many grand British buildings and a couple of buildings in colonial Australia. Blore himself did not visit the town of Alupka, however, he was well informed about the area's mountainous landscape and terrain. Construction restarted in 1830, under the supervision of Blore's fellow architect William Hunt. Architecture Blore's new plan for the corps de logis of house was constrained by Vorontsov's wish to use the footings and foundations which had been built for Harrison's original design; this severely restricted the shape, size and layout of the palaces principal rooms. However, rather than erect a compact and low classical villa, as Harrison had designed, Blore's plan was radically different, with strong English Tudor Renaissance features on the northern side, and an eclectic medley of western and Islamic features on the southern. The central bay of the southern facade was inspired by Delhi's Jummah Masjid mosque, which enabled the classical exedra of Harrison's design to be incorporated, once given an Islamic makeover, harmoniously into the design. In places, the seemingly at odds architectural styles can be viewed simultaneously; this is particularly so in the chimney stacks which resemble Islamic minarets. These coupled with the castellated parapets add what appears to be an almost Moorish element to the late English Renaissance air of the northern facade. However, it is the southern garden facade which displays the strongest of the building's Islamic influences; it has a flat roof and is topped by two minaret-style towers at its centre. These minarets flank the massive, central bay, this takes the form of a projecting double height porch entered through a high Islamic horseshoe arch. The interior of the porch takes the form of an exedra, which is really an elaborately decorated open vestibule; it has an inscribed Shahada stating \\"There is no God but Allah\\" in Arabic. The porch is flanked by two short wings, each of two bays and adorned with cast iron balconies and verandahs overlooking over the terraces and their statuary. While the designs for the corps de logis were confined by the foundations of Harrison's earlier plan, the secondary wings and precincts were not. Abandoning completely Harrisons concept of bedrooms set in terraces beneath the corp de logis, Blore's assistant architect, Hunt, opted for the typical vast sprawling wings and servants' quarters of the 19th century English country house. These took full advantage of the gradients and topography of the site, and with their courtyards came to resemble a small medieval, fortified town of towers and high castellated walls. Nowhere is this more evident than the Shuvalov Passage, an enclosed carriage drive squeezed between the high walls of two wings, leading from the castellated Western Gatehouse to the forecourt before the northern facade.Brett, p95. The passage, which twists and turn beneath high wall and towers and even passes under a bridge, resembles the street of a medieval town, rather than the approach to a country house. The North Forecourt, accessed from the Shuvalov Passage which emerges from the lefthand arch, serves as a cour d'honneur to the corps de logis (to the left). To the right, can be seens part of the vast service wings and stables Construction Vorontsov imported thousands of his serfs from the Moscow, Vladimir, and Voronezh governorates of the Russian Empire to construct the palace. These unpaid workers performed all the labour by hand, aided only by primitive hand tools. Masons were also brought in to help with the construction. The palace's ashlar blocks were made from a local greenish- gray tinge diabase, chosen for its unique colour to match the colours of the surrounding mountainous landscape and forest greenery. All other building materials were imported from outside the Empire. One of the first of the palace's many rooms to be completed was the main dining room, built from 1830 to 1834. The principal central wing of the mansion was constructed from 1831 to 1837. Between 1841 and 1842, a billiard room was constructed adjoining the dining room. From 1838 through to 1844, the guest wing, the east wing, towers, the service wing, and the front entrance were completed. The final wing built of the mansion was the library wing; this was under construction from 1842 to 1844. The remaining four years of building works were spent on the palace's interior decoration. William Hunt, the onsite architect employed to oversee Blore's design, while remaining faithful to Blore's overall plans, was not afraid to alter them. Most notably, the Western Gatehouse, the main approach to the palace, was intended to have octagonal towers, but Hunt redesigned the gatehouse in an English 14th-century castle style, with solid round towers and machicolations, nearly identical to the towers at Bodiam Castle, East Sussex. After completion of the palace, Hunt remained at Alupka working on an assortment of projects in and around the estate building long carriage drives, roads and structural improvements to the gardens surrounding the palace. One of his largest projects was an extension to the palace itself, the Shuvalov wing, which was to be the summer retreat of the Vorontsov's daughter Countess Sofia Shuvalova and her children, the countess was estranged from her husband This wing linked the palace to the western gatehouse, and created the enclosed Shuvalov Passage leading to the main entrance. Hunt remained in the Prince's employ until his retirement in 1852. Interior The palace consists of a total of 150 rooms, the principal of which are panelled with wood block floors. Inside the corps de logis, it had been Blore's intention to follow the English 19th century tradition of distinct masculine and feminine suites of reception rooms; with a library, dining rooms and billiard room ensuite to left of the central hall for men, and a massive drawing room to the right for women. This layout of gender designated zones had become popular in Victorian England; however its intention was not to segregate the sexes, but more to define furnishings ‚Äì the male zones tended to have heavy oak furniture and dark 'Turkey' carpets, whereas the female zones would have more delicate furnishings of rosewood, Aubusson carpets and chintz soft furnishings.Girouard, Life in the English Country House, p292. However, for unknown reasons, this concept was never executed and the female part of the house was extended into the male territory, with the intended billiard room becoming the countess's boudoir while the study became a further small sitting room for feminine use. Above these seaward facing rooms were the family bedrooms. Following the female claim to the principal rooms of the corps de logis, the library and dining room were relocated to a secondary wing not built until much later. This secondary wing is linked to the west of corps de logis by a large arcaded loggia; originally open, it is now glazed and known as the Winter Garden. A later secondary wing, known as the Shuvalov wing (named after Vorontsov's son-in-law, Count Shuvalov) was not part of Blore's original plan and designed by his assistant, William Hunt. There is now a museum comprising several rooms most notable of which are the blue room, chintz room, dining room, and the Chinese cabinet. The museum covers the first floor's first eight rooms, featuring more than 11,000 exhibits, including engravings of the 18th century, paintings from the 16th through 19th centuries, including those depicting Crimean scenarios by Armenian seascape painter Ivan Aivazovsky, as well as furniture crafted by Russian wood masters from the 19th century. The library, the last of the palace's rooms to be completed, is based on Sir Walter Scott's own library, revealing the personal friendship that Blore had with Scott. Inside, the library features about 6,000 literary and musical works of the 18th and 19th centuries. The interior's woodwork, including the doors, panelling, and ceilings, is made out of oak. The walls are adorned in cloth, with designs made by Dutch, Flemish, French, and Italian painters. The palace's Gothic fireplaces are made out of polished diabase. Grounds Formal parterre bedding on the uppermost terrace The palace sits surrounded by gardens and a park; these grounds consisting of were laid out by the German landscape gardener Carolus Keebach in the first half of the 19th century in the form of an amphitheatre featuring wide open spaces and gardens planted alongside the walkways. The walkways are gravelled with 29 bags of coloured stones from the Crimean village of Koktebel. The largest of the landscaping undertakings carried out on the palace's grounds were performed between 1840 and 1848 with the aid of soldiers, who also assisted in the formation and leveling of the terraces laid out before of the palace's southern fa√ßade. Fauna was introduced from various locations throughout the world, including the Mediterranean, the Americas, and East Asia. Flora imported over a 150 years ago still numbers almost 200 species. A 19th-century vintage postcard showing the Vorontsov Palace viewed through its manicured gardens Keebach had the park designed in such a way that it would incorporate the landscape's native vegetation, mountain springs, and nearby rocky masses, in addition to foreign plant species brought in from the Mediterranean, both North and South America, as well as from East Asia. Today, the park still features more than 200 exotic tree and shrub species, including a wide variety of palm trees, laurels, cypresses, olive trees, and evergreen viburnum, among many others. In the summer of 1848, the palace and its grounds were enhanced by the addition of three pairs of white marble lions; this statuary was placed alongside the wide flight of steps climbing the terraces to the palace. Each of the statues, by Italian sculptor Giovanni Bonnani, is depicted in a varying pose ‚Äì a pair of \\"sleeping lions\\" at the bottom of the steps, \\"waking lions\\" near the centre, and \\"standing Medici lions\\" at the top nearest the palace. Crimea's coastal highway runs through the park, dividing it into the upper and lower portions. The upper park is dominated by the mountain springs, as well as by the native southern coast forestry and clusters of foreign tree growth. A feature of the upper park is the Fountain of Trilby, which was placed there in 1829. The lower park is modelled in the style of an Italian Renaissance garden. Influence Catherine Dadiani in Zugdidi, Georgia (1873‚Äì78) The construction of Mikhail Vorontsov's summer residence in Alupka so impressed Tsar Nicholas I that he decided to have his own family retreat built at neighbouring Oreanda. In September 1837, the Tsar and Tsarina visited the Crimea for the first time. The viceroy entertained them at his new residence in Alupka. Impressed with the palace and its setting, the Prussian-born Empress commissioned from Karl Friedrich Schinkel, a Berlin-based architect, a design for a new residence. His design called for a striking combination of Greek Revival and Egyptian Revival elements. The palace was to be perched on the craggy shore in Oreanda. The court architect Andrei Stackenschneider offered a less expensive design, which was adopted. The Tsarina's palace was built between 1843 and 1853 under the supervision of William Hunt and Combioggio, an architect from Odessa. This edifice was destroyed by an 1882 conflagration, with only a marble rotunda remaining. The next emperor, Alexander II, had the royal residence moved to Livadia. Vorontsov's building activities started a tradition of imperial residency of the area which would attract many of Russia's smart and most elite to also build villas and palaces in the Crimea. One of the first such buildings was the Gaspra Palace, designed by William Hunt in the 1830s for Prince Alexander Galitzine, one of Alexander I's most trusted advisors. Blore's design inspired another straightforward imitation on the eastern shore of the Black Sea: the Dadiani Palace in Zugdidi that was commissioned by the last Princess of Mingrelia in 1873 and, at the time of the Russian Revolution, was in possession of the House of Murat. Neo-Moorish architectural elements were also incorporated in the design of the royal villas in Dulber and Likani. Owners and occupiers * Count, later (1845) Prince Mikhail Vorontsov (30 May 1782 ‚Äì 18 November 1856), Viceroy of New Russia, builder of the palace. He was renowned for his success in the Napoleonic wars. As the Viceroy of the Caucasus from 1844 to 1853, he supervised the conduct of the Caucasian War. Having completed the palace, Vorotsov, now suffering progressive blindness, spent little time there. His commitments to the expanding Russian Empire took him to Tiflis; there, he waged wars on the rebellious local tribes. The now elderly Vorontsov, a confirmed anglophile, was particularly distressed by the outbreak of the Crimean War, which, in England, was heavily promoted by his English nephew, Sidney Herbert. Embarrassed and distressed, he retired from public life to the privacy of Odessa. Vorontsov died in 1856, having lived just long enough to see the signing of the Peace of Paris. Vorontsov's tomb in the Odessa Cathedral was ruined by the Soviets, but his remains survived the Soviet era and were returned to the newly rebuilt cathedral in 2005. * Countess, later Princess Yelizaveta Vorontsova (19 September 1792 ‚Äì 27 April 1880), a daughter of Count Franciszek Ksawery Branicki by Aleksandra von Engelhardt, one of the nieces and heiresses of Prince Potemkin, the founder of New Russia (who was childless). She was one of the many Polish noble women who married the Russian aristocrats during the brief period of the \\"Polish enchantment\\", when Alexander I publicly conducted an affair with Marie Czetwerty≈Ñska and his heir Konstantin was in love with her sister Joanna Wyszkowska. When exiled to the Black Sea coast after The Gabrieliad affair, Alexander Pushkin wooed Elise Vorontsova in Odessa and addressed several poems to her. Apparently resenting his advances, the countess complained to her husband, who had his young rival exiled to a northern village. After her husband's death, Yelizaveta rarely visited the Alupka Palace, preferring to live in Odessa. A gala at Semyon Vorontsov's mansion in Tiflis, by Eugene Lanceray ** Prince Semyon Vorontsov (23 October 1823 ‚Äì 6 May 1882), the only son and heir of Prince Mikhail. He served under his father in the Caucasus with distinction and figures in Leo Tolstoy's novella Hadji Murat, as do his wife and father. On 26 August 1851 he married in Alupka, against his parents' wishes, Madame Stolypina, n√©e Princess Trubetskaya, once famed for her radiant beauty. The couple found the cost of running the palace too high, and after making various economies they seldom visited the Crimea. After Semyon's death without issue, the widow plundered the palace of many of its entailed furnishings and paintings and settled at the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne with the Duca di Montelfi, her son from a previous marriage. ** Countess Sofia Shuvalova (1825‚Äì15 August 1879), the daughter of Prince Mikhail and Princess Elizaveta. In 1844, she married Count Andrei Shuvalov, the owner of Pargolovo (not to be confused with another branch of the Shuvalov family whose family seat was the Schloss Ruhenthal in Courland). The marriage was not happy, inducing her to live separately from her husband, who died in the house of another woman in 1876. From the 1850s Sofia and her children used Alupka as a country retreat, occupying the long West Wing now named after them, the Shuvalov Wing, while her brother Prince Semyon occupied the remainder of the palace. *** Count, later (1882) Prince Pavel Vorontsov-Shuvalov (1846‚Äì1885), the son of Sofia Shuvalova and grandson of Mikhail Vorontsov, inherited the largely empty palace and the Vorontsov title on the death of his uncle in 1882. He died three years later. His wife, Yelizaveta Stolypina, n√©e Baroness Pilar von Pilchau, outlived him by 54 years. They had no children. An imperial ukase from 7 July 1882 designated Alupka the centrepiece of the Vorontsov majorat, which was to be inherited in the right of primogeniture.–°. –í. –õ—é–±–∏–º–æ–≤. –¢–∏—Ç—É–ª–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ —Ä–æ–¥—ã –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π –∏–º–ø–µ—Ä–∏–∏. –°–ü–±, 1910. *** Count Mikhail Shuvalov (7 July 1850 ‚Äì 5 January 1904) inherited the entailed estate in 1885 from his brother Count Pavel.

On his death, the title of Prince Vorontsov (Serene Highness) became extinct. *** Countess Elizaveta Vorontsova-Dashkova (25 July 1845 ‚Äì 15 July 1924), the elder sister of Pavel and Mikhail Shuvalov. She was the last private owner of the palace, and restored much of its former splendour, buying back many of its former furnishings, and living quietly there with her husband, Count Illarion Ivanovich Vorontsov-Dashkov, a scion of the only surviving branch of the Vorontsov family. At the beginning of the World War I, Count Illarion was the Governor-General of Caucasus. He died in Alupka in 1916.

Yelizaveta's descendants also include actress Anne Wiazemsky. Later history The north forecourt. Today, the palace a tourist attraction receiving thousands of visitors each year. Four years after the October Revolution, in 1921, the palace was nationalised, after which it was converted into a museum. This occupied the main, dining, and library wings of the building. In addition to the state- confiscated Vorontsov family possessions, the museum also featured the exhibits of the nationalised estates of the Romanovs, Yusupovs, and Stroganovs all of whom had estates in the vicinity. In 1927, the palace's Shuvalov wing housed a sanatorium \\"10 Years of October,\\" while the palace's main concourse became home to Alupka resort's polyclinic and spa baths. When the Soviet Union entered World War II in 1941, most of the museum's exhibits were evacuated for safety from Alupka. However, some 537 artistic and graphics exhibits (including temporary exhibition paintings from the State Russian Museum and the Simferopol Art Museum), 360 pieces of the building's decor, sets of unique furniture, and a series of historic books were stolen by occupying Nazi German forces, amounting to a loss of 5 million rubles at the time. During the war, Adolf Hitler presented the palace as a reward to Field Marshal Erich von Manstein, who made it personal headquarters. This explains why the palace was so well preserved. The building was later converted into a museum for Wehrmacht officers stationed in and around Crimea. Originally, the Nazis had planned to dynamite the palace, but the rapid advance of the Separate Coastal Army and supporting Yalta partisan groups during the Crimean Offensive saved the palace from destruction. From 11 to 14 February 1945, the Yalta Conference took place in the neighbouring, former imperial Livadia Palace; this was between representatives from the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. Winston Churchill and part of his British delegation were given temporary residence within the Vorontsov Palace. Within two weeks, construction workers had restored 22 rooms in the main palace, 23 rooms in the Shuvalov wing, and even replanted the palace gardens. The palace's English- inspired architectural style gained praise from Churchill himself: Churchill was so taken by the garden's Medici lions that he later asked Stalin if he could take them home; Stalin declined the request. One of the Medici lions so admired by Churchill Following the war, the palace was used as a summer retreat for the Soviet secret police, and later as a trade sanatorium. In 1956, the palace was once again reinstated as a museum, and two years later, it was further expanded by art treasures. However, the majority of the artwork looted during the war was never recovered, only a small fragment of the former collection was returned to the museum. In 1965, the palace was incorporated into the \\"Alupka Palace-Park Complex,\\" a national historical preserve which also includes the Massandra Palace in neighboring Massandra, built in the Louis XIII ch√¢teau style for Russian Tsar Alexander III. Although it has survived years of wear and warfare, one of the palace's wings is now in danger of collapsing into the Black Sea below. Cracks have begun to appear in the library, housing almost 10,000 books and manuscripts. Although Edward Blore had a state-of-the-art drainage system built into the palace's foundation, years of neglect and the construction of a nearby sewage pipe in 1974 have helped to increase the potential for a landslide. Another potential looming disaster is surrounding the medieval-style gatehouse near the palace's west side.

It is constructed from a thin sheet of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE, \\"Dyneema\\") laminated between two sheets of polyester. It is used in various applications that call for a fabric with high tensile strength, but where low weight is desirable, such as sails and ultralight backpacking equipment. The material was developed by the Cuben Fiber and Cubic Tech Corporations in the 1990s. In 2015, Cubic Tech was acquired by DSM, their supplier for the UHMWPE fiber. The product was subsequently renamed \\"Dyneema Composite Fabric\\" (\\"DCF\\"), a generic brand name DSM uses for all of their composite products which incorporate UHMWPE. History The name Cuben Fiber was coined by the press in reference to America¬≥ (pronounced America Cubed), the winner of the 1992 America's Cup. During the 1992 Cup, that yacht reportedly used sails made from precursors to the currently available commercial product. In late 2007, the Cuben Fiber Corporation was acquired by North Sails. North Sails said they would continue to supply the materials to competitors when available. Cubic Tech Corporation has the exclusive rights to develop and sell \\"Cuben Fiber\\" laminates for all non-sailing applications. On 13 May 2015, a news release was announced from Heerlen, Netherlands that Cubic Tech Corporation had been bought out by Dyneema, a subsidiary of DSM Dyneema, a subsidiary of DSM, officially known as Koninklijke Dsm Nv. Additional details about the buyout and the future of Cubic Tech Corp were revealed in an online Q&A; with DSM. Production Dyneema Composite Fabric is a laminated fabric constructed from Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE) fiber monofilaments and polyester, PVF, etc. films. Cuben fiber is sometimes confused with carbon fiber, one of the many fibers used as a reinforcement in some Cuben Fiber laminates. Cubic Tech Corporation's ultra-high performance flexible laminates were re-branded from Cuben Fiber to CTF3 in 2009. Cubic Tech Corp produces CTF3 with a wide variety of fibers such as Vectran, Carbon, Kevlar, etc. In August 2013 it was announced that Cubic Tech Corp. had produced a version of their waterproof breathable fabric which utilizes the GE eVent fabric. Uses The material is used in yachting, performance sailing, windsurfing, inflatables, airship hulls, medical applications and increasingly in ultralight backpacking equipment, such as tents and backpacks. Similar to sails made from traditional woven sail cloth, Dyneema Composite Fabric sails are constructed from panels that are bonded and sewn together, as opposed to 3DL sails that are laminated over a mold. The material is reportedly more durable than laminated sails of comparable strength while being lighter in weight. UHMWPE has excellent resistance to ultraviolet light and is less prone to disintegrate from repeated flexing than either Kevlar or carbon fiber.

It was inspired by the teen movie Can't Hardly Wait (1998). Music reviewers generally were positive regarding the song, and it has often been placed in rankings of the band's best songs. Background Blink-182 formed in 1992 in San Diego, California. The band's principal songwriting team‚Äîguitarist Tom DeLonge and bassist Mark Hoppus‚Äîfrequently wrote fast-paced, often autobiographical pop punk songs dealing with age, maturity, and most prominently, relationships. The band grew successful throughout the decade with independent albums and constant touring, attracting a following at the peak of punk rock's mainstream popularity. \\"Going Away to College\\" was among the last songs the band developed for Enema of the State. It was written primarily by bassist Mark Hoppus, and credited to both he and guitarist Tom DeLonge. Drummer Travis Barker receives no songwriting credit, as he was considered a touring musician at this point in their career. Despite this, he served as the song's arranger, \\"selecting the tempos and organizing the flow of verses, choruses, and breaks.\\" Producer Jerry Finn prepared for the sessions by attending one of the band's concerts in Las Vegas, where he polled audience members on what song topics they most enjoyed. Many concertgoers, particularly women, spoke positively about Hoppus's tunes focusing on heartbreak. Finn asked Hoppus to write another break-up song, and claimed that Hoppus returned the following day with \\"Going Away to College\\". The song was inspired by the film Can't Hardly Wait, a teen movie that centers on a group of high school students graduating and \\"facing an uncertain future.\\" The film, released the prior year, had featured Blink's music on its soundtrack. Though he had seen it twice, Hoppus viewed it a third time while at home sick on Valentine's Day 1999. The film's plot line led him to think about \\"how much it sucks when people are in love in high school\\" and are forced to be separated after graduation by different colleges in different cities. He reportedly wrote the song in ten minutes and scribbled its lyrics on a napkin. As the bulk of the album's percussion was recorded at the beginning of the process in Los Angeles, the band had to go back to record the song's drum tracks. The drums were recorded at the home studio of jazz keyboardist Chick Corea, called Mad Hatter Studios. Composition The song explores the concept of lovesickness. In the song, Hoppus writes from the perspective of an adolescent boyfriend, grappling with the reality that his relationship may change upon graduating from high school. He sings of skipping a lecture to watch his significant other play soccer. In one subsequent lyric, he anxiously asks, \\"Is my picture still hanging in her locker?\\" The song's chorus finds Hoppus declaring his love over a \\"bouquet of clumsy words / a simple melody.\\" Altogether, Hoppus pleads with his lover to \\"don't forget to think about me / And I won't forget you.\\" Randall Colburn, writing for online publication Consequence of Sound, observes that Hoppus switches between \\"romantic immediacy and indifference; sometimes he's singing directly to his girlfriend, and sometimes she exists only in the past tense.\\" According to sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing America, \\"Going Away to College\\" is written in common time with a tempo of 210 beats per minute. Set in the key of B major, it follows the chord progression of B‚ÄìBsus2‚ÄìB‚ÄìBsus2 for the intro, a series of B‚ÄìE5‚ÄìF5 in the verses, and D5‚ÄìE5‚ÄìB5‚ÄìF5 progression for the choruses. Hoppus and DeLonge's vocal parts span from A4 to F5. The song boasts a \\"chugging, stop-start verses and hooky chorus.\\" CNN reporter Donna Freydkin referred to it as a \\"bittersweet ditty about young love.\\" Writer Jeff Yerger, for Stereogum, likened its contents to \\"Valentine cards you'd send to your crush, or wistful notes you'd write in someone‚Äôs yearbook.\\" Reception \\"Going Away to College\\" debuted as part of a medley of songs with 30-second snippets available to stream on a2b music, an early digital music service owned by AT&T.; It was officially released as a part of Enema of the State on June 1, 1999. Welsh indie rock group Los Campesinos! covered the song in 2014. The song has received acclaim, and has been considered among the band's best moments. Ann Powers, in her review for The New York Times, interpreted the track as a \\"portrait of the male psyche as a slapdash work in progress.\\" Kyle McGovern of Spin selected it as among the set's \\"many highlights\\". Veteran music journalist and essayist Robert Christgau noted the band's lineage when he called it as \\"the love song the Descendents put Green Day on earth to inspire.\\" Billboard contributor Chris Payne said it \\"captures the glory days of Blink.\\" An uncredited Alternative Press writer called it a \\"tender moment of youthful vulnerability,\\" in contrast with the brattiness found elsewhere on the record. Consequence of Sound placed it at number two in a 2015 ranking of the band's best songs, with the writer Randall Colburn extolling it as a \\"perfect\\" summation of \\"puppy love\\": \\"It's the sound of two people growing apart: the widening gulf, moments of renewed connection, the eventual drift [...] that's usually how it goes in real life, right?\\" A Rolling Stone reader's poll placed the song at number eight on a top-ten ranking of the band's best. A live rendition of the song was included on the band's 2000 album The Mark, Tom, and Travis Show (The Enema Strikes Back!). In the recording, Hoppus substitutes the lyric \\"But you're so beautiful to me\\" with \\"But you're so beautiful, Skye Leigh,\\" a reference to his wife, Skye Everly. The Welsh indie rock group Los Campesinos! covered the song in 2014 at several live shows, and in a session for satellite radio station SiriusXMU.

He served as the fifteenth mayor of the City of Washington for one two-year term, from 1852 to 1854. Early life John Walker Maury was born in Caroline County, Virginia in 1809 to a prominent Virginia family. His great- grandfather, Reverend James Maury, had founded the Maury Classical School for Boys at which Thomas Jefferson was his student for two years. His grandfather, Walker Maury, was headmaster of a school in Williamsburg; his great-uncle, \\"Consul\\" James Maury, was the United States' first consul to Liverpool, England, appointed by George Washington; and his second cousin, Matthew Fontaine Maury, was a famous and accomplished oceanographer. He moved at 17 to the City of Washington (as Washington, D.C. was then called), where he established a law practice. He married five years later, in 1831, to Isabel Foyles, eventually producing 15 children. Political career At the age of 26, John Walker Maury was elected to the Common Council of Washington City, serving for five years until declining to run again in 1840. However, one year afterward he was elected to the Board of Aldermen. After eleven years as an alderman, Maury was elected as Mayor in 1852. As mayor, Maury was associated with three main efforts during his term of office. First, he and the philanthropist William Wilson Corcoran convinced Congress to appropriate funds for the Government Hospital for the Insane, now known as St. Elizabeths. Second, he was mayor when Congress funded a study under the supervision of Montgomery C. Meigs to improve the public water supply by means of the Washington Aqueduct. Third, Maury provided payments to sculptor Clark Mills to complete the statue of Andrew Jackson on horseback that stands in Lafayette Square, across the street from the White House. Mills later repaid Maury from a commission for an equestrian statue of George Washington. Despite these contributions, Maury merits only a passing and dismissive mention in Constance McLaughlin Green's Pulitzer Prize-winning work, Washington, Village and Capital, 1800-1878, in which she writes that \\"the gentle John Maury was beloved as a man but was a singularly inept politician.‚Äù In 1854, at the peak of the Know-Nothing movement in American politics, Maury was unseated by Know- Nothing candidate John T. Towers. Maury died one year later, shortly before his 46th birthday. Like some other early mayors of the City of Washington, such Robert Brent and Benjamin G. Orr, Maury owned slaves. In the United States Census of 1840, Maury reported five slaves including a boy and a girl under 10 years old. In 1850, Maury reported a 23 year old female. In 1862, Maury's widow Isabel filed a petition under the District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act seeking compensation for six slaves who were emancipated under the Act. According to her petition, the slaves had been willed to her by her late husband. The enslaved were Eliza Dyson and her five children, ages 4 to 15. At the time of his death in 1855, Maury was president of the National Bank of the Metropolis, a position he had assumed after the death of John P. Van Ness in 1846. Maury was interred at Congressional Cemetery in Washington. His son William Arden Maury would recall that \\"There was, perhaps, never a greater outpouring of the people from President Pierce and the venerable Senator Benton down to the humblest citizen than was seen at his funeral.\\" Maury Elementary, one of the District of Columbia Public Schools, was named in honor of John Walker Maury upon its construction in 1886.

Cobden A hurrier, also sometimes called a coal drawer or coal thruster, was a child or woman employed by a collier to transport the coal that they had mined. Women would normally get the children to help them because of the difficulty of carrying the coal. Common particularly in the early 19th century, the hurrier pulled a corf (basket or small wagon) full of coal along roadways as small as in height. They would often work 12-hour shifts, making several runs down to the coal face and back to the surface again.Channel 4. \\"The Worst Jobs in History - Hurrier\\".

Adults could not easily do the job because of the size of the roadways, which were limited on the grounds of cost and structural integrity. Hurriers were equipped with a \\"gurl\\" belt ‚Äì a leather belt with a swivel chain linked to the corf. They were also given candles as it was too expensive to light the whole mine.

The younger ones often worked in small teams, with those pushing the corf from the rear being known as thrusters. The thrusters often had to push the corf using their heads, leading to the hair on their crown being worn away and the child becoming bald. Some children were employed as coal trappers, particularly those not yet strong enough to pull or push the corf. This job saw the child sit in a small cutting waiting for the hurriers to approach. They would then open the trapdoors to allow the hurrier and his cargo through. The trappers also opened the trapdoors to provide ventilation in some locations.Durham Mining Museum, \\"Mining Occupations\\". Accessed 19 February 2007.Riley, Bill. Pitwork.net. \\"Early Coal Mining History: Child Labour \\". Accessed 13 November 2009. As mines grew larger the volume of coal extracted increased beyond the pulling capabilities of children. Instead, horses guided by coal drivers were used to pull the corves. These drivers were usually older children between the ages of 10 and 14. Working conditions Workers in coal mines were naked due to the heat and the narrow tunnels that would catch on clothing. Men and boys worked completely naked, while women and girls would generally strip to the waist; but in some mines might be naked also. In testimony before a Parliamentary commission, it was stated that working naked in confined spaces \\"... it is not to be supposed but that where opportunity thus prevails sexual vices are of common occurrence.\\" Legislation trapper from the Children's Employment Commission reportrightthumb In August 1842 the Children's Employment Commission drew up an act of Parliament which gave a minimum working age for boys in mines, though the age varied between districts and even between mines. The Mines and Collieries Act 1842 also outlawed the employment of women and girls in mines. In 1870 it became compulsory for all children aged between five and thirteen to go to school, ending much of the hurrying. It was still a common profession for school leavers well into the 1920s. The 1969 song The Testimony of Patience Kershaw by Frank Higgins (recorded by Roy BaileyIf I Knew Who the Enemy Was Fuse Records CF 284; 1979 and The Unthanks) is based on the testimony of Patience Kershaw (aged 17) when she spoke to the Children's Employment Commission. Her testimony includes: \\"The bald place upon my head is made by thrusting the corves ... I hurry the corves a mile and more underground and back; they weigh 3 cwt ...

It is situated approximately west of Pocklington and south of the A1079 at Wilberfoss. It lies 1 mile east of the River Derwent after which the village takes its name. Newton upon Derwent Community Centre and Methodist Chapel, 2002. According to the 2011 UK census, Newton upon Derwent parish had a population of 315, an increase on the 2001 UK census figure of 282. History Newton upon Derwent's history reflects the history of much of the rural countryside of the Vale of York and to some extent that of other relatively low-lying parts of the North of England. The village, has no Church or Manor House to give it a feeling of importance. Instead it has a Methodist Chapel (now used as Village Hall), a Public House the \\"Half Moon\\", no shops and a few working farms. Not so long ago there were many active farms and the village had more facilities in the way of shops, a smithy and a wheelwright. Since Newton was not referred to in the Domesday book and not mentioned in records until around 1150 (and called Niweton in 1190, Neweton in 1246), it is possible that it was founded in the 64 years between 1086 when the Domesday book was compiled and 1150. The name suggests that it was a new village (Old English n‚Äòowa t√£n) and thus a deliberate foundation and not just a village that had grown up by random settlement. However, note that the Roman Road between Brough and York may have run through what is now the north end of the village and it is thus possible that there may have been some settlement here in Roman times. Furthermore, some of the villages around Newton were mentioned in the Domesday book and it is unlikely that where the village is now would just have been a blank on the map. Evidently, however, such settlements that there were before 1086 were not sufficient for the area to be called a village. The prefix \\"iuxta Derwent\\" was first mentioned in the 13th century and \\"super Derwent\\" in the 14th century, presumably to distinguish our Newton from the many others that existed. Why this association with the Derwent was used when the river is about a mile away is possibly because, at the time, this was the nearest clear feature by which it could be identified. Note that the name is Newton upon Derwent (from the Latin iuxta meaning near to or super meaning above) and not like Newton on Ouse, where the \\"on\\" is used because it is actually on the river.. Later, the Derwent became important to the village as a means of water transport. The fields on which the village have depended, stretch to the river. The water- meadow alongside the river, flooded often during the winter and spring is called the Mask has been and still is a part of the village's economy providing considerable crops of hay in the summer and grazing for sheep in the autumn and winter. The name Derwent (Latin Derventione, from the name of a Roman station on the Derwent) is thought to be derived from the Old British word derua (Welsh derwa) meaning an oak and thus the name Newton upon Derwent suggests \\"The new village above the river where the oaks grow\\" The river is mentioned in Bede circa 730 AD as Deruuentionem and in AD 959 as Deorwentam. One of the puzzles about the village is that the oldest houses that are now seen appear to date from the late 18th century. There are records of earlier inhabitants of the village, for instance Robert de Hoton who died in 1447 and John Horsley who died in 1719 but there are no records of the houses in which they lived. Were all the original houses (probably of wood and thatch) replaced at the time of the Enclosures around 1766 and did the village then become the ‚Äùnew town\\" which we can see to-day from that point? The earliest map of the village is dated 1755 however shows that the majority of houses in the village were represented on that map. They may not however be the actual houses which are present to-day and may have been rebuilt on their original sites.Newton on Derwent Local History Society Geography The village stands on the Escrick moraine which was formed during the retreat of the last Ice Age, some 10,000 years ago. This moraine forms a low ridge, standing above the Vale of York. The ridge, at this point is about above the surrounding countryside which itself is some above sea level it stretches, in a curve, from the west of Escrick in the south to near Stamford Bridge in the north. There were droveways for moving stock and these trackways crossed the vale of York by the natural bridges provided by the moraines. It thus seems likely that there would be a pathway along the top of the moraine along what would now be the road from Wilberfoss and what is now called Back ‚Äòo Newton. The linear \\"street\\" village of Newton is not however placed along the old pathway along the top of the moraine, The Geological map of 1872 shows that there was a line of natural springs and wells along what is now Main Street and therefore the siting of the village offset from the road along the top of the moraine would be a sensible thing to do to capitalise on the existence of water.

MPGN accounts for approximately 4% of primary renal causes of nephrotic syndrome in children and 7% in adults. It should not be confused with membranous glomerulonephritis, a condition in which the basement membrane is thickened, but the mesangium is not.  Type  There are three types of MPGN, but this classification is becoming obsolete as the causes of this pattern are becoming understood. Type I Type I, the most common by far, is caused by immune complexes depositing in the kidney. It is characterised by subendothelial and mesangial immune deposits. It is believed to be associated with the classical complement pathway. Type II The preferred name is \\"dense deposit disease.\\" Most cases of dense deposit disease do not show a membranoproliferative pattern. A 2012 review considers DDD to be in a continuum with C3 glomerulonephritis, one reason the use of the type I to type III classification system is falling out of favour. Most cases are associated with the dysregulation of the alternative complement pathway. DDD is associated with deposition of complement C3 within the glomeruli with little or no staining for immunoglobulin. The presence of C3 without significant immunoglobulin suggested to early investigators that DDD was due to abnormal activation of the complement alternative pathway (AP). There is now strong evidence that DDD is caused by uncontrolled AP activation.(reviewed in Appel et al., 2005; Smith et al., 2007). Smith, R. J. ., Harris, C. L., & Pickering, M. C. (2011).

Over time, vision can deteriorate, and subretinal neovascular membranes, macular detachment, and central serous retinopathy can develop. Type III Type III is very rare, it is characterized by a mixture of subepithelial and subendothelial immune and/or complement deposits. These deposits elicit an immune response, causing damage to cells and structures within their vicinity. Has similar pathological findings of Type I disease.Pickering, M. C., D‚ÄôAgati, V.

Hogan, 458 U.S. 718 (1982), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court, decided 5-4, which ruled that the single-sex admissions policy of the Mississippi University for Women violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.. Background of the case The Mississippi University for Women was established in 1884 in Columbus, Mississippi and originally called the Industrial Institute and College, later changed to Mississippi State College for Women. It was the first state-supported women's college in the United States. In 1971, the School of Nursing was established, initially offering a two-year associate's degree, and later four-year baccalaureate degree and graduate degree programs. In 1979, Joe Hogan, a registered nurse and nursing supervisor in Columbus who did not have a baccalaureate degree in nursing, applied for admission to the MUW School of Nursing's baccalaureate program. Although he was otherwise qualified, he was denied admission to the School of Nursing. School officials provided the option to audit courses in which he was interested, but he could not enroll for credit because he was male. Hogan could have attended classes and received credit in one of Mississippi's two public, coeducational programs leading to a Bachelor of Science in Nursing, but these were at the University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg (178 miles from Columbus) and the University of Mississippi in Oxford (114 miles from Columbus). Hogan filed an action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi, claiming the single- sex admissions policy of MUW's School of Nursing violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and seeking injunctive and declaratory relief as well as compensatory damages. Case history The District Court ruled in favor of the Mississippi University for Women, concluding that maintenance of MUW as a single-sex school bears a rational relationship to the State's legitimate interest \\"in providing the greatest practical range of educational opportunities for its female student population.\\" The court held that the admissions policy was not arbitrary: providing single-sex schools is consistent with a respected, though by no means universally accepted, educational theory that single-sex education affords unique benefits to students. Stating that the case presented no issue of fact, the court informed Hogan that it would enter summary judgment dismissing his claim unless he tendered a factual issue. When Hogan offered no further evidence, the District Court entered summary judgment in favor of the State.http://www.mensbiz.net/subpage%20mississippi%20university.html The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that because the admissions policy discriminated on the basis of sex, a rational relationship test was improper, and the proper test was whether the sex-based admissions policy was substantially related to an important governmental objective. The court, while recognizing that the State has a significant interest in providing educational opportunities for all its citizens, found that the State failed to show that providing a unique educational opportunity for females but not for males had any substantial relationship to that interest. Opinion of the Court The Supreme Court's ruling did not require that the entire university become coeducational; however, the Board of Trustees of Mississippi State Institutions of Higher Learning ordered the university to change its policies to allow the admission of qualified males into all university programs.http://www.ihl.state.ms.us/universities.html During the 2005-2006 academic year, MUW's student body was approximately 15% male.http://www.ihl.state.ms.us/research/fast_facts_0506.pdf The Court's ruling also did not require the school to change the name of the school, and as a result the school remains \\"Mississippi University for Women\\". Suits have been filed against the university to change the name claiming that its name and mission discourage males from applying for admission. These suits were dismissed as groundless and had no effect on the name. In 2002, the administration of the university considered changing the name and pursued efforts to do so despite opposition, particularly from alumnae. In her convocation speech on August 11, 2008, President Limbert announced a new proposal to remove \\"women\\" from the university's name which was abandoned.

Their Leader, recognizable by long rabbit-like ears, is caressing The Dreadful Flying Glove. The Blue Meanies are a fictional army of fierce though buffoonish music-hating beings and the main antagonists in the surreal 1968 Beatles cartoon film Yellow Submarine. They allegorically represent all the bad people in the world. Their visual appearance was mostly designed by Heinz Edelmann. Producer Al Brodax said that the chief blue meanie resembled production coordinator Abe Goodman. Description The Blue Meanies are set on the occupation and silencing of Pepperland, a colourful, musical utopia that lies beneath the sea. The Meanies have blue skin, claw-like hands (That all have 6 fingers on each hand.) and wear black masks around their eyes and hats that resemble Mickey Mouse ears on their heads. They are humanoid in appearance - albeit with blue faces and very long noses. History The Blue Meanies arrive in Pepperland and do everything they can to oppress the peaceful, music-loving paradise. This prompts one of Pepperland's sailors, the former Commander now newly appointed Lord Admiral \\"Old Fred\\" (or \\"Young Fred\\" according to the even older Lord Mayor) to escape in the Yellow Submarine of the title to find help. Old Fred journeys to Liverpool where he meets the Beatles, whom he enlists for help, because, as musicians, they would be able to restore harmony (and indeed melody) to Pepperland. The Meanies, in his absence, cause the lovely and colourful Pepperland to turn into a very grey, dull and oppressive place, wrought with thorns and thistles. Later in the story, a Meanie abducts the Beatles' companion, Jeremy Hillary Boob, PhD, the so-called \\"Nowhere Man\\", and we see, when the Beatles arrive in Pepperland, how the Meanies have laid waste to the former paradise and petrified the natives. The Beatles find Pepperland's confiscated musical instruments and their own look-alikes, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and bring music back to Pepperland. This restores colour to the hills and plants and life into the Pepperlanders (who had been petrified by various weapons in the Meanies' possession). With their spell thus broken, the Meanies cease to have a hold on Pepperland: even their guns start shooting flowers instead of missiles. Those that do not flee are invited by the Beatles to stay and \\"mingle\\" and they make peace with their former enemies. Blue Meanies and their weapons=Chief Blue Meanie The Chief Blue Meanie, also known as \\"His Blueness\\", is the leader of the Blue Meanies and the main antagonist from the 1968 animated film Yellow Submarine. A flamboyant character, with a high pitched voice, he is set on conquering Pepperland and ruling with fear and oppression; a supreme despot given to psychotic tantrums and violent mood swings. His most heinous of crimes from The Beatles' point of view, however, is his hatred of music. He is voiced by Paul Angelis, who also provided the voice of Ringo Starr. The Chief Blue Meanie arrives in Pepperland accompanied by Max, his assistant, and his large army of Meanies. He begins his campaign of terrorizing Pepperland by firing a massive glass ball at the Beatles' doubles, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts' Club Band, who play music in this peaceful and colorful world, where all the natives generally behave in a friendly manner towards one another. As the Chief comments, \\"it can't last\\". The soundproof glass sphere covers the band, making their music inaudible, and in their panic to run away, the natives are fired at by the Blue Meanies' guns, whose missiles both drain their victims' colour on contact and seem to petrify them. The Chief bombards the natives with various weapons and other evil species that vary in their ferocity and eccentricity (as demonstrated when the Beatles' arrival to Pepperland, when a sharp-toothed \\"snapping turtle-Turk\\", consumes a young girl's paper windmill) that will reduce Pepperland's colourful hills and plants to bare thorns and grey wasteland, with the only green existing in the form of giant apples that the \\"Apple Bonkers\\" pluck from trees to \\"bonk\\" on peoples' heads. Later in the film, the Meanies kidnap the Beatles' friend and comrade, Jeremy Hillary Boob, also known as the \\"Nowhere Man\\". After the Beatles finally arrive in Pepperland, the Chief Blue Meanie is incensed when he sees the hills and trees returning to their proper colours at the sound of their music; he sends his fiercest weapon, \\"The Dreadful Flying Glove\\" after the heroes. The Glove is thwarted by the Beatles song \\"All You Need Is Love\\", and the Meanies flee, knocking over the chief in the process. In a final, petty attempt at retribution, the Chief threatens to tear the newly freed Nowhere Man into little pieces. However, he is thwarted by Jeremy's poetry and magic, sprouting roses from his nose and body. He flees with the rest of his army, but later concedes defeat and decides to \\"mix\\" with the Beatles and Pepperlanders; however, at the very end, when the Beatles appear in the flesh to the audience, John says that \\"Newer and Bluer Meanies have been sighted within the vicinity of this theatre\\". =Personal characteristics= Like the other Blue Meanies, the Chief is masked, has yellowed teeth with a navy blue woollen suit and massive, paw-like hands with six claws on each. He is taller than most of the other Meanies and whereas the \\"common\\" Blue Meanies wear a hat reminiscent of Mickey Mouse ears, his hat looks more like Oswald the Lucky Rabbit's. Also, whereas the \\"common\\" Blue Meanies wear orange and yellow striped stockings with mary jane shoes, he (and his assistant, Max) wears jackboots, complete with spurs: a pale blue boot on the right foot, a navy blue boot on the left. He has an unpredictable, if not split, personality, which sends him from apparently effeminate, quiet and friendly to loud, raging and malicious - though no less buffoonish in either. Max is often the victim of his abuse, being punched, shot or stomped on by a \\"Butterfly Stomper\\". He also has another Meanie carry around a stool so that he can sit down whenever he likes; presumably, were he to fall on the ground it would be at the stool-carrier's peril. He also states (until the very end, when he starts warming to the Beatles) that \\"we Meanies only take 'no' for an answer\\", and gets extremely angry at the sound of the word \\"yes\\", even when being answered in the affirmative. Sometimes his own aggression gets the better of him and he needs to be revived with \\"nasty medicine\\", which makes him even more eccentric than he already is. He encourages his army of Meanies to be as unpleasant as possible, but after admitting defeat, he later confesses that his cousin is \\"the bluebird of happiness\\". Max *Max: Second-in-command of the Blue Meanies and the hapless majordomo to the Chief Blue Meanie, he wears a large bright red \\"M\\" insignia on his chest. Like the Chief Blue Meanie, he wears a hat with long rabbit-like \\"ears\\", (though his \\"ears\\" are colored blue instead of black) rather than the mouse-type worn by the other meanies. He frequently incurs the wrath of the Chief Blue Meanie by making well-intentioned, but unhelpful suggestions or comments at inopportune moments.  The Dreadful Flying Glove  * The Dreadful Flying Glove: Probably the fiercest of the Blue Meanies and their strongest weapon. Though there is only one glove, it is a force to be reckoned with: crushing, squashing, or \\"o-blue-terating\\" whoever or whatever its master directs it to attack. It varies from being a right-handed glove to a left-handed one, depending on the situation, has a stylised face, with the thumbnail acting as the eye and the index finger as the nose, the middle finger and ring finger serving as its mouth (grinning teeth are clearly visible between these fingers). As it clenches itself into a fist, it covers up its eye, temporarily blinding it. The glove also has an evil, sinister sounding laugh in a low register. It is ultimately defeated when John sings \\"All You Need is Love\\" and entangles it in the letters of all the words that spring from his mouth as he sings.  The Four-Headed Bulldog  * The Four-Headed Bulldog: A Blue Meanie that's similar to Cerberus, the three-headed hound of Hades of Greek mythology, it has four heads, each with very sharp teeth. It is extremely strong, and its handler is no match for it if it wishes to walk in a particular direction. It is ultimately defeated when the Beatles and the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, sing \\"Hey Bulldog\\" and subject it to much taunting and trickery which confuses and antagonizes it.  Types of Blue Meanies  *The Storm Bloopers: also known as the \\"Blue Menials\\" (The Boob refers to his captor as a \\"Blue Menial\\", though he may have simply been making a pun), the most numerous of the Blue Meanies. Like the Chief Blue Meanie, they have navy blue wooly suits and domino masks, but wear Mickey Mouse-ear- like hats (instead of the type worn by the Chief and Max, whose hats look more like Goofy's ears). They have six claws on each hand, and wear yellow-and- orange striped tights and Mary Jane shoes (again, the Chief and Max are the exceptions here, as they both wear jackboots with spurs: light blue boot on the right foot, navy blue on the left). They also seem to be able to make their eyes glow so that they can see in the dark, which makes the head resemble a sort of movie projector. These particular Meanies carry guns that fire pale-blue jagged arrows which, on contact, drain the victim's colour and petrify him or her ‚Äì although it seems to varying degrees or only temporarily, because several victims in the film are seen to cry, smile, or look up, and several natives of Pepperland are seen to back off at the sight of the Dreadful Flying Glove. *The Apple Bonkers: These are 15-foot tall, thin men who can walk from hill to hill at a stride, who wear purple tail-coats (with lapels), bow ties and top hats (with feathers in them). Their weapons of choice are giant green apples, which they drop on people's heads and which have the same effect as the jagged arrows. If one can reach high enough, they, too, can be knocked out by such weapons, as the Beatles later discover. Singing is the only way to reverse the effect of being \\"bonked.\\" They bear a slight resemblance to Victorian undertakers. Up close, their faces are more distinguishable: one Apple Bonker sports muttonchops, another sports a handlebar moustache and curved goatee on his chin, and another sports just a moustache. *The Countdown Clowns: These are tall, fat clowns whose heads can spin round and round, and who give out loud shrieks when they're ready to attack or sound an alarm to alert the Meanies. If their noses are pressed, which often makes a \\"squee\\" sound, an explosion goes off in the direction their faces are pointed. They have no hands or arms themselves, however, and so a Blue Meanie has to press their noses for them, often needing to prop a ladder up against them, or sit up on their shoulders when doing so, because they are very tall. When the Meanies' spell is broken, they end up simply producing positive words such as \\"Yes\\" and \\"OK\\" in block capitals when they try to cause an explosion. *The Snapping Turks: Possibly the most pettily cruel creatures in the film, these are dressed like stereotypical Turkish men, sporting handlebar moustaches and curved goatees on their chins (they even sport curved Arabic shoes and fezzes). They are short and fat, and their stomachs are in fact oversized, predatory faces whose reptilian sharp-toothed mouths consume objects. We see one of them eating a little girl's paper windmill on purpose to make her cry. *The Butterfly Stompers: These are wide, bullying creatures with cat-like faces. They each carry a number on their chest, and for whatever reason they find it entertaining to try to trample butterflies. One of them also stomps upon Max's head at the Chief's behest (or possibly mistaking it for a butterfly too.) The trailer specifically names one of them as Robin. *The Hidden Persuaders: These are large, fat, bald, humanoids. They each smoke big cigars and carry a martini glass which appears to contain a floating eyeball instead of an olive. They have an extra hand inside their oversized wingtip shoes, which typically wields a pistol and shoots whenever the toe of the shoe is raised. If the shoe is closed at the right time, however, they can be made, quite literally, to shoot themselves in the foot. They are seen only briefly in the film.

Charnadis, a demon speaking with the lamia, provides the narrative for the further story, told to brighten the lamia's day. In his youth, Charnadis was accustomed to use his wings to travel through space and explore remote and distant places. One day, traveling through a particularly remote and distant galaxy, Charnadis encounters a grey, desert planet orbiting a dying sun: the world of Sadastor. Flying over its equator, Charnadis finds a deep gorge in the former ocean beds and comes eventually nigh to a tiny, green pool, the last of the oceans. About to leave, a voice calls to him, asking him why he is there, and then relating its tale: it is a Siren, called Lyspial, the last of her kind on their world. After recounting her memories of Sadastor in its earlier days, when the seas were nearly boundless and she could easily prey upon sailors, Charnadis offers her transport to another world. Sobbing, Lyspial explains that she, being born of the seas of Sadastor, is bound to them and must perish with them. The narrative ends with Charnadis chiding the lamia, and advising that she reflect on the siren's fate, which was infinitely worse than the Lamia's own present predicament.

The mantle is rounded posteriorly and not fused with the head dorsally. The head is wide, and it and mantle are covered in tubercles which are often large and widely distributed but, in juveniles and as a local variant, they are small and not easily observable. The mantle cavity is divided by a muscular septum. The fins are kidney-shaped and set obliquely. There is often a luminous organ on the ink sac. The tentacles are retractable and have straight, clearly defined clubs. The suckers on the clubs are arranged in about eight rows and are all much the same size. The arms are short but powerful and there are two rows of suckers in the mid part of each arm.Rossia palpebrosa Marine Species Identification Portal. Retrieved 2011-10-04.

According to Rafsanjani, The idea of the school originated from a conversation he had with a group of influential Bazaaris whom he had close ties to, with the goal of fulfilling the need of a girl- exclusive school with conservative viewpoints in a bazaari-majority district. He then added, > \\"The deceased Akhavan Farshchi purchased for this school 3000 square metres > of land and, through weekly meetings, which were based around jihadist > topics, with the help of fundamental companions we succeeded in founding > this place.\\" During the Revolution The Entrance of the Refah School, pictured in February 1st 1979 =February 1st to 11th= On February 1, 1979, with the help of Bazaaris, the school was turned into a headquarters for the leader of the revolution, Ruhollah Khomeini, and the revolutionary operations. Due to the influence of Khomeini's followers, the school was chosen as a safe and temporary residence for Khomeini and the base of the revolutionary operations. It was designed so that: * The underground floor was the prayer room and the dining hall * The 1st floor was for the press and reporters * The 2nd floor was the residence of Ayatollah Khomeini and his close followers * The 3rd floor was the base of operations of the Council of the Islamic Revolution The school was used by the Council through meetings planning the Interim Government and several discussions at night time. It was similar to Khomeini's campaign in Neauphle-le-Ch√¢teau. Although the school was now more in the control of the clergy than Khomeini's non-clergy assistants, such as Sadegh Ghotbzadeh and Ebrahim Yazdi. It was at this school and time were Khomeini and his long-distant followers become close admirers. It also showcased Khomeini's tendency to give the Clergy a superior role in the future political system. The school however could not used for the people's visit to the Ayatollah for the fact that it could not hold the large groups of people who had come to meet Khomeini. Therefore, the Alavi school, which was close to the Refah school and was also built by the Bazaaris, was used for that intention exclusively. On February 9, the school's underground was transformed into a weapons storage room when a weapons factory near the Doshan Tappeh Air Base was seized by armed rebellions. With the help of Mohammad-Ali Rajai and Hussein-Ali Montazeri, the weapons were distributed between revolutionaries, who were later able to emerge victorious in a battle against the Shah's Imperial Guard. =After February 11= As the control of Tehran was being lost to the revolutionaries, many Pahlavi regime officials were arrested by Islamist-Marxist guerrillas, where high-ranking officials were transported to the school's underground, where it was transformed into a temporary prison. The proximity of the jailed regime officers and Ayatollah Khomeini prompted his companions to move his residence to the Alavi school to secure his full safety. The aftermath of the alt= For various reasons such as fear of coup d'√©tat by the military and the calls for the Pahlavi regime officials to be tried and be executed by Khomeini and his followers, dozens of high-ranking officials were rounded up in the school and were tried by the Islamic Revolutionary Court in the matter of hours each and were all executed for various charges such as \\"spreading corruption on earth\\" and treason. The courts were led by Sadegh Khalkhali and ultimately Khomeini gave the last word for all actions to be taken. After the trials, the defendants who were sentenced to death were executed by firing squads on the rooftop of the school. The first three officials who were sentenced to firing squad were Nematollah Nassiri, head of SAVAK, Mehdi Rahimi, Tehran's chief of police, and Army Major general Reza Naji. They were executed at midnight of February 15, 1979. By spring 1979, the number of executions on the rooftop of the Refah school had reached dozens. The school had become infamous for its scenes of the executions being photographed and published in newspapers such as Kayhan and Ettela'at. Today After Khomeini's residence was moved in Jamaran, Refah school was transformed into a Cultural and educational Institute with the aims of Islamic and cultural education. According to Rafsanjani, there had been plans of extending the institute to an elementary school and college for girls.

Cello √©tudes are most often written by cellists to help other cellists improve their playing ability. Music that is written for performance generally does not focus on instrumental technique. Performance music is written to convey a certain sound, mood, set of emotions or ideas. Some cello etudes, while focusing on cello techniques, also focus on musical ideas. Some rise to the level of performance pieces. However, it is rare to find cello etudes programmed in recital. The last set of cello etudes which had such universal cellistic appeal was the \\"High School of Cello Playing\\" written by David Popper (1843‚Äì1913). His etudes are widely considered a pre-requisite to becoming a professional cellist. There are several other composers whose cello etudes are widely studied by cellists.

Towers was born in Alexandria, Virginia in 1811 to parents who had recently arrived in Virginia from Bingham, England. He was trained as a printer, joined the Columbia Typographical Society in 1834, and maintained several book and printing shops in Washington until 1852 when President Millard Fillmore appointed him superintendent of printing at the U.S. Capitol. (The position was the forerunner of the modern Government Printing Office.) Towers became involved in politics in the 1830s, publishing a journal called the Whig Standard. He was subsequently elected to the Common Council in 1842, where he served for four years until election to the Board of Aldermen in 1846. With the collapse of the Whig Party in 1852, Towers joined the Know- Nothing movement, the political party defined by its opposition to rights for immigrants and Roman Catholics. Banking on his strength as a member of city government and his reputation as a printer, the Know-Nothings put Towers up for mayor against incumbent John Walker Maury in 1854. The Know Nothings peaked all across America that year, electing mayors in most of its most important cities; Towers was no exception, sweeping into office. Towers' accomplishment was largely limited to developing plans for an infirmary and workhouse on the Marine reservation in Southeast Washington.Historic Congressional Cemetery - D.C. Schools At the time, the city was steadily growing from a small rural village to a busy metropolis, but Towers and his fellow government officials were unused to the changes and were not sure how to govern the changing city. He continually, but without success, petitioned Congress to fund and provide for the nation's capital. Towers did not seek reelection in 1856. He died one year after leaving office and was interred in Congressional Cemetery. In 1887, an unnamed school building on the corner of 8th and C Streets SE in Washington DC was renamed the Towers school in his honor. In 1929 it was merged with the Wallach School and Eastern High School to create the Lemon G. Hine School. The building itself was torn down between 1949 and 1966 for a new Hine School building.

HCPT stands for Hosanna House and Children's Pilgrimage Trust, Hosanna House being the property the organisation owns in the hills above Lourdes. Founded in 1956 by Michael Strode. History HCPT is a charity which was formed in 1956 when Dr. Michael Strode first took four children with disabilities on a pilgrimage holiday to Lourdes, establishing a new approach to pilgrimage for children with disabilities. From HCPT grew the Hosanna House Trust, which was the response to a request from young adults for an opportunity to experience a similar holiday to that of the children. Today, Hosanna House, the Trust's residential centre just outside Lourdes in Bartr√®s, takes nearly 2,000 pilgrims in groups of 40 to 50, many of whom have disabilities or special needs. These guests stay for a week between Easter and November. In 1996, HCPT celebrated the 40th Anniversary of the Pilgrimage Trust. Here, the whole Pilgrimage, of around 5000 people, congregate in St Bernadette's Basilica for the Trust Mass, the culmination of which is the singing of the song 'Rise and Shine', the unofficial HCPT Anthem. In 1998 HCPT and the Hosanna House Trust were combined as \\"HCPT - The Pilgrimage Trust\\". Pilgrimages today HCPT takes around 1,000 children from the UK on its annual Easter pilgrimage - with groups from Ireland, Belgium, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, USA and West Indies joining it too. The total size of the Easter Pilgrimage is around 5000, which includes all helpers, nurses, doctors and chaplains. A further 1,500 people stay at Hosanna House each year, in groups of up to 50. These groups welcome people of all ages. HCPT also owns a villa in Bartr√®s, near Hosanna House. This is a self-catering house for up to 15 people which is accessible and available to all throughout the year. Activities HCPT's pilgrimages are centred on the international Shrine of Our Lady of Lourdes and gives people of all ages and abilities the opportunity to experience a thoroughly enjoyable group holiday. All are welcome to join the pilgrimage whatever their faith is, or if they have none. Fundraising HCPT relies entirely on donations from the public and fundraising by its 250+ groups throughout the UK. In 1999, Donnie Munro, former lead singer of the band Runrig, released a record in aid of HCPT which received the support of Frances Shand Kydd, the mother of Diana, Princess of Wales.

History  General Cinema Lakehurst opened in 1974 as a part of Lakehurst Mall, a shopping mall across the street from the theater. The theater was built in keeping with General Cinema's tradition of adding screens near major shopping destinations. General Cinema Lakehurst was originally built with three screens, and its opening film was The Exorcist. In 1984 the theater expanded to eight screens, and finally in 1987 to 12-screens and 3,200 seats;Cinematour.com, Lakehurst Cinema 12, accessed November 23, 2009 boasting the record for \\"Most Movie Screens in America\\",, quoted by Cinemateasures.org, Part 2 although theaters with more screens did already exist at that time. Movie Pullings The theatre received heavy local press in March 1991 after a large gang-related brawl occurred in the theater's parking lot at the opening of New Jack City. The melee resulted in the pulling of all showtimes for the film at the theater.Wakeugan , Movie-theatre.org, Accessed November 23, 2009 Later that year the theatre was one of four to pull the film Boyz n the Hood, after a Chicagoan was murdered at the movie's opening day at a nearby theatre. In 1995 the theatre also refused to show the movie Showgirls. Decline Beginning in 1991 with the opening of the colossal Gurnee Mills 10 minutes northwest; Lakehurst Mall began a decade-long decline. The dying mall was drastically affecting the surrounding businesses; many restaurants, shops, and attractions closed. In 2000, General Cinema Lakehurst closed as a result of General Cinema's bankruptcy. Lakehurst was one of many former General Cinema theaters not acquired by AMC Theatres. The next year, Lakehurst Mall (with the exception of the surviving Carson Pirie Scott department store) was shuttered. On September 28, 2001 the multiplex re-opened under the name Lakehurst Cinemas, and was then operated by Village Theatres, a small chain of theaters in the Chicago area. Curiously, except for a small banner covering a sign at the theater entrance, the theater still bore General Cinema signage on the building's north side, and on its sign near Waukegan Road (Route 43). In 2003 the Lakehurst Mall property was purchased by the Shaw Company, and was demolished in 2004 for a mixed-use redevelopment known as Fountain Square of Waukegan. It was also announced that Lakehurst Cinema would close in the future, but a date was not given. Demolition in August 2007A visit by Lake County Building Inspectors in December 2006 resulted in a red- tag on the structure; and revealed numerous life-safety concerns including lack of heat in several theaters, a leaking roof, water in a screening room, and inoperable fire alarms. The theater briefly re-opened after repairing the most severe problems, and announced it would cease operation permanently after January 7, 2007. Among the last films to be shown at the theater were Happy Feet, Rocky Balboa, Night at the Museum, Stomp the Yard, Eragon and We Are Marshall. Demolition of the multiplex began in mid-July 2007, and the theater was gone by mid-August. While the press touted a Holiday Inn Express would be built on the former site of the theatre, it was actually built approximately west of the site. The site today is a vacant dirt-filled lot, and an Aldi store was finally built in the theater's parking lot in 2018.http://www.suburbanchicagonews.com/newssun/news/209256,5_1_WA13_LAKEHURST_S1.article External links *General Cinema References Cinemas and movie theaters in Chicago Demolished theatres in Illinois Waukegan, Illinois Buildings and structures demolished in 2007 ","title":"Lakehurst Cinemas"},{"id":"9566159","text":"The Once Bitten Soundtrack is a soundtrack album to Howard Storm's 1985 comedy horror film Once Bitten.

In the early months of World War II, he helped in the administration of the Channel Islands when they were occupied by the Germans.  Early life  Educated in Guernsey and in Cherbourg he worked for a lawyer in Guernsey before passing the qualification of Licenci√© en Droit at Caen University (necessary to practice law in Guernsey) in 1914, just before the war broke out. Although a member of the Royal Guernsey Militia, Sherwill volunteering as a dispatch rider but was called up as an air mechanic in the Royal Navy Air Service Armoured Car Division and served as a petty officer until he was commissioned into The Buffs in 1916. Sherwill was awarded the Military Cross (MC) for services at the battle of Messines in 1917, where he was wounded, being promoted to Lieutenant shortly afterwards. He received a second bad wound in 1918, and used the recovery time to continue with his law studies. On demobilisation in 1919 he moved to England to pass the English Bar exams before returning to Guernsey in May 1920 to apply for admittance to the Bar as an Advocate of the Royal Court. His military service continued with the Royal Guernsey Militia being appointed Lieutenant in 1921, Captain in 1922 and Major in 1925 before retiring in 1928 when the militia was scaled back. Standing for election to the States of Guernsey, he served as a Deputy from 1921 to 1926 whilst continuing to practice law. In 1935 Sherwill became His Majesty's Attorney General (with the duties of public prosecutor), having to give up private practice and accept the reduced income associated with public office.  World War II  During World War II, he was President of the Controlling Committee during the German occupation of the Channel Islands, responsible for the running of the Island government and the main contact for the German authorities, reporting only to the elderly Bailiff, Victor Carey, until Sherwill was deported to Cherche-Midi Prison for his part in the Nicolle and Symes affair. Jurat John Leale took over his responsibilities as president. German proclamation of measures against Sherwill, Nicolle, Symes and others following Operation Ambassador Sherwill's patriotism was confirmed, when at great personal risk he doctored Guernsey militia uniforms to make them appear to be British Army uniforms, in order that Nicolle and Symes would be treated as soldiers, rather than spies (as undercover operatives were routinely shot by both sides as part of protocol.) Sentenced to two months in prison, taken to France in a Junkers Ju 52, he spent November and December 1940 in several prisons including 45 days in the very unpleasant Cherche-Midi Prison in Paris. On his return he was informed he would no longer be allowed any contact with the German authorities. This was lifted for the winter of 1942‚Äì3 when he again practised as Attorney General. He conducted himself with distinction at the Laufen Internment Camp to which he was eventually deported in February 1943, becoming head of the British forces/citizens at the camp in June 1943. Laufen was a chateau housing single men, mainly from the Channel Islands as well as some \\"American\\" men, who had been in Europe when America entered the war. Liberation came on 4 May 1945 with the internees being flown to England in June.  Controversy  Sherwill has been variously accused of excessively cordial relations with the German occupying troops, and acquiescing without due resistance to the Feldkommandant. Most notable perhaps is the episode of August 1940, when Sherwill, with the professed intention of reassuring those evacuated Guernsey citizens who anxiously awaited news of their loved ones who had chosen to remain on the Island, recorded a broadcast for Radio Bremen assuring of the 'kindly' treatment of islanders at the hands of the German troops. No doubt Sherwill's intentions were noble, but his naivety was nonetheless exploited by the German propaganda machine in their desire to show that the realities of German occupation were far removed from the bleak picture propagated by British communiqu√©s and propaganda.  Post 1945  He returned to Guernsey after the War, and was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in December 1945. He served as Bailiff of Guernsey between 1946 and 1959. He was knighted, when made a Knight Commander in 1949. In 1960, he retired to Alderney, then later moved to Guernsey with his wife to live with his son and daughter-in-law (Rollo and Jenny Sherwill). He died at his son's home on 25 September 1968 at the age of 78.

The main A5086 road from Cockermouth to Egremont runs roughly north‚Äìsouth through the community. The Whitehaven Cleator and Egremont Railway, later LMS, also ran through the parish, with a station in Wright Green. North of Rowrah this lost its passenger service in 1931 and was closed to all traffic in 1954. Unusually, the village has no obvious centre. While St. Michael's church is built on the highest point in the village, the local pub, the Lamplugh Tip Inn, is over a mile away on the A5086. (The inn is currently closed and has been undergoing renovation for a few years.) Lamplugh School (the local primary school) is at the hamlet of Kirkland. Because Lamplugh Civil Parish is very large, it includes Kirkland as well as Eskett and also, until recent boundary changes, parts of both Ennerdale Bridge and Rowrah. The village is on the edge of the Lake District National Park. The roads from St. Michael's Church towards Loweswater and from the church towards Ennerdale form part of the national park boundary, with the national park lying to the east of the roads. While parts of the village lie within the national park, almost all dwellings are outside the national park and so are cheaper than in Loweswater. The boundary of this large parish is shown on 1:25,000 O.S. sheet OL4 \\"English Lakes NW\\". Much more information about Lamplugh is available in \\"The Parish of Lamplugh\\" published by the parish council in 1993 , and \\"Lamplugh Church\\" published by Lamplugh and District Heritage Society in 2004.

AKC Temperament Test In 2019, the American Kennel Club launched its AKC Temperament Test (ATT), a pass-fail evaluation by AKC licensed or member clubs. Evaluators are specially trained AKC Obedience judges, Rally judges and AKC Approved Canine Good Evaluators.  American Temperament Test Society  American Temperament Test Society, Inc. was started by Alfons Ertel in 1977. Ertel created a test for dogs that checks a dog's reaction to strangers, to auditory and visual stimuli (such as the gun shot test), and to unusual situations in an outdoor setting; it does not test indoor or home situation scenarios. It favors a bold confident dog. , the top three dog breeds that have tested with ATTS are Rottweiler (17% of all tests conducted), German Shepherd Dog (10%), and Doberman (5%). The test itself is copyrighted and prospective testers must apply to become official. The test is conducted as a pass-fail by majority rule of three testers, and each individual dog is graded according to its own breed's native aptitudes, and taking into account the individual dog's age, health and training. Though the ATTS is the only organization which posts pass rates \\"by breed\\", the breeds cannot be compared against each other because the grades are based on each breed's own characteristics. Despite that, attorneys have been encouraged to use the ATTS published \\"results by breed\\" to defend their clients in dangerous dog cases by comparing pass rates of the breed of their client's dog against the pass rates of other well-known non-aggressive pet dog breeds. , 34,686 tests have been completed; less than 1,000 per year. BH-VT test by FCI BH-VT, an abbreviation of a German term which roughly translates to \\"companion dog test with traffic safety part\\", is governed by rules from F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI). The BH-VT has become the prerequisite examination for entry into almost all dog sports in Europe that require off-leash work, such as Schutzhund/IPO/IGP, agility and flyball. It is not required for conformation shows where dogs are always on leash. Dogs must be at least 12 months old (older for some breeds). There are two portions: obedience and traffic. For the obedience portion, each of the following are part of the test: heeling on leash, heeling off leash, sit exercise, down with recall, down under distraction. The traffic portion includes tests for encountering a group of people, bicyclists, cars, joggers, other dogs, and being tethered for a short period alone without its handler, and walking through a group of people that are moving. Aggression towards other dogs is at all times forbidden in FCI events, and any bite or attempt to bite or attack a human or other dog will immediately disqualify a dog. Any aggression towards another dog will permanently disqualify a dog from any participation until it has proven itself through passing a repeat BH-VT with behavioral test. An earlier version of the test was called simply \\"BH\\", and it was Schutzhund's preliminary test that all dogs must pass before going further in Schutzhund training. With the increase in (non-protection) dog sports for all breeds, the new BH-VT omits the \\"gun shy\\" test, which was instead moved to the next higher level of Schutzhund trials. Canine Good Citizen by AKC The Canine Good Citizen by the American Kennel Club tests for good behavior in a companion dog. Over 1 million dogs and their owners have participated in CGC since it was started in 1989 (over 30,000 dogs per year). Puppy aptitude tests  There are numerous puppy aptitude and temperament tests which are used by buyers when selecting a puppy and by breeders when evaluating a litter of puppies. Shelter evaluations Shelters use temperament tests to help identify dogs with problem behaviors, including aggression, and to help to increase the rate of successful adoptions. For some, these tests are a way to determine if a dog should even be offered for adoption, or to whom they will restrict an adoption of an individual dog (adult-only household or sanctuary only, versus family with children). In a time when shelters are trying to improve outcomes for shelter animals, some consider temperament tests to be controversial and result in too many dogs being labeled negatively, leading to euthanasia. As such, some shelters have discontinued using any form of testing for their dogs. Such tests seek to assess a dog's manners, its reaction to strangers, small children and other pets. The tests try to identify if a dog has problems with food aggression, resource guarding, or separation anxiety. Tools used for evaluations might include a leash, bowl of food, a lifelike doll, a fake arm, and dog treats or toys.  Assess-a-Pet and Assess-a-Hand  The Assess-a-Pet Temperament Test involves use of the Assess-a-Hand, a vinyl or latex mock hand and arm mounted on a wooden dowel, used to avoid bites to the tester who uses it to approach, pet, and then pull away a bowl or toy from the dog. The device was invented by Sue Sternberg. The test is typically given after a certain number of days at a shelter, with retesting after a failure, and additionally after resolution of illness. Match-Up II Shelter Dog Rehoming Program This test requires two people: a handler and a recorder. It has 11 sub-tests and the answers are placed in a computer program. It was designed to \\"help shelters learn about the personality and needs of each dog so that behavioral interventions can be implemented and successful matches can be made.\\"  SAFER Test  SAFER (Safety Assessment for Evaluating Rehoming) by the ASPCA is used to \\"help identify the risk of future aggression and individual behavioral support needed before adoption for each dog in a shelter.\\" Wolfhound testing  Temperament testing in wolfhounds is an old and proven form of a mild dog fighting used in young dogs to test their temperament. For example, an American standard for an Irish Wolfhound is defined as \\"a large, rough-coated, greyhound-like dog, fast enough to catch a wolf and strong enough to kill it.\\" It states that \\"the breed's well-being demands strong, gentle hounds, never aggressive or shy, not even \\"edgy\\" ones. Edgy hounds are presently under control, but without their handler's constant control would surely at least retreat, or perhaps manifest worse characteristics of the weak temperament.\\" Typically it is practiced with larger breeds known in Russia as –≤–æ–ª–∫–æ–¥–∞–≤ (literally: dogs meant for the hunting of wolves). These large breeds (such as Caucasian Shepherd) in Russia undergo the testing called —Ç–µ—Å—Ç–æ–≤—ã–µ –∏—Å–ø—ã—Ç–∞–Ω–∏—è –≤–æ–ª–∫–æ–¥–∞–≤–æ–≤ (i.e. testing/examination of dogs meant for hunting wolves). The breeders believe that males used for breeding have to have preserved fighting ability and dominant tendencies because it is a typical mark of their breed. They also believe that weak dogs without fighting abilities will cause a decrease in quality of the breed. As part of the test, breeders release two young dogs and let them behave naturally even if they begin to fight. If the fight looks dangerous, the breeders pull the dogs off each other to prevent their injury. If one of the participating dogs shows fear from the other dog and displays no dominant tendencies, he is removed from breeding to ensure his weak nature is not passed on to his descendants.

It is a grammar school with academy status founded by Sir Eliab Harvey in 1674. Admissions A selective school for boys only, the school has around 900 on its roll. Although officially known as the Harvey Grammar School, it is called The Harvey by many locals or abbreviated to HGS, as its partner school the Folkestone School for Girls is known \\"FSG\\". The school is situated on the A2034 (once the A20) at the junction of the B2064 and near the Folkestone West railway station, Folkestone Cricket Club, Folkestone Optimists Hockey Club at the Three Hills Sports Park and Folkestone Invicta F.C.. It is easily accessed from the last junction of the M20 motorway. History The grammar school was established in 1674, following the death of William Harvey, the eminent physician and discoverer of the major details of blood circulation. A small class with one schoolmaster was first created, until Eliab Harvey, William's nephew, acting as executor of his uncle's will, founded a larger school of the same name. In July 1921, the body of the headmaster of the day, 43-year-old Major Harold Arthur Denham, was found in undergrowth in Hawkinge with self- inflicted bullet wounds. An inquest later arrived at a verdict of \\"suicide while temporarily insane\\".Alumni Cantabrigienses: Dabbs-Juxton (Cambridge University Press, 1944), p. 276 Leadership and structure The school has a well established house system, with four houses (Discovery, Endeavour, Resolution and Victory) that use the colours green, blue, red and yellow respectively. Each house is split into 5 separate forms and split between junior and senior (e.g. DJ1, DS1, EJ1, ES1 .etc) The current headteacher is Scott Norman and current Chair of Governors is John Dennis. The current Head Boy is Harris Morris (Discovery), and the current Deputy Head boy is Laurie Smith (Discovery). The school The main school site is situated in the Folkestone suburb of Cheriton. It has been there since 1912-13 when the main building was constructed. In 1989, school buildings in the town centre, next to the Folkestone Library, were closed on completion of a new Science & Technology Block on the main site. A sports hall was added in 1997 and, in 2001, a further building was added with facilities for ICT, Art, Business Studies and Biology; this was named the John Edwards Centre in 2002 in honour of the school's headmaster from 1986 to 2002. In 2015 a new 12 classroom building was added and named the Wright building in honour of Bill Wright who served as headteacher between 2008 and 2014. In 2017, a new P.E block was constructed of which includes a gymnasium and fitness suite along with 2 classrooms for the Religious Studies department. This new block is annexed with the current Sports Hall. The school also boasts an adjacent sports field named in honour of long serving Head of PE Alan Philpott, with a cricket pavilion named after former pupil Les Ames (Kent and England wicketkeeper- batsman); money for this was raised by the Old Harveians Association under the leadership of its President, John Smith. The pavilion was opened in 1997 by Colin Cowdrey in a ceremony also attended by Godfrey Evans, another famous former Kent and England wicketkeeper. In a special match to mark the pavilion opening, the school's 1st XI cricket team played a celebrity team that included ex Kent and England opening batsmen Brian Luckhurst and Mike Denness. The school also benefits from the proximity of the Three Hills sports facilities. The Harvey's badge is worn by all boys 11‚Äì16 on their school uniform. The badge is inscribed with 'Temeraire Redoutable et Fougeux'. The uniform consists of a black blazer with badge, black trousers and black shoes, a white shirt and a tie. The tie of which uses the colour corresponding to the pupil's house, in a diagonal-stripe fashion. The sixth form wear a different, less strict but still formal suit of their choice, with a different tie which is plain black with the school badge insignia emblem. Once they have reached the sixth form, this can rise to have a single house-coloured stripe diagonally across, to denote prefect status. The Harvey has an excellent record in sport across the county of Kent and beyond. It has reached more county football and cricket finals than any other school in Kent, a proud tradition largely established by long-standing Head of PE Alan Philpott (1957‚Äì92) (alumnus). Academic record The school was rated as outstanding in all areas by OFSTED in 2016. Academic standards are high, and many of the boys achieve good GCSE grades. The majority go onto the Sixth Form which was praised by OFSTED in 2016. OFSTED also praised the school for the pastoral care of its students which includes continual revision of targets and parent information evenings for GCSE options, Sixth Form study and parent evenings. The flexibility offered by the school, especially at A Level where it works very closely with the Folkestone School for Girls to provide an extensive range of subjects, makes it a popular choice in the area. The Harvey often achieves above 60% A*-B grades at A Level and close to 100% 5 A*-C at GCSE. Michael Howard, former local MP and former Leader of the Conservative Party, described the Harvey as \\"a jewel in Folkestone's crown\\" at a school prize- giving, whilst the Good State Schools Guide refers to the Harvey as \\"a potent mix of friendliness and formality, of tradition and innovation\\". Many school leavers choose go on to study a wide range of degree subjects at university. A handful of students apply to Oxford or Cambridge each year, with successful applications in the last few years in subjects including Natural Sciences, Mathematics with Physics, English Language and Literature, Anglo-Saxon, Norse & Celtic and Philosophy, Politics & Economics. Specialist and academy status The school converted to academy status on 1 August 2012 and holds specialisms in Sport, Mathematics and Computing. Community involvement The Harvey promotes charities very strongly and has raised around ¬£300,000 for charity, previously through an Annual Sponsored Walk around the surrounding coastline and/or countryside. It involved all students (992) setting out along a marshalled route with sponsored cards, helping raise money for charity. An annual Prizegiving Day is held at the Leas Cliff Hall in Folkestone to recognise those boys who have achieved a high standard in academic and/or sporting activities. Guest speaker in 2018 was Edward Argar who is a Member of Parliament for the constituency of Charnwood since the 2015 elections and a former pupil of the school. The Headmaster, Chair of Governors, Head Boy and Guest Speaker are invited onto the stage to make speeches and then prizes are presented to the recipients. Extra-curricular activities There is an extensive range of trips: to the United States for football and computing, to Barbados for cricket, and Barcelona and the Netherlands for hockey and basketball. The football trips to the USA have taken place every other year since 1989. The 2009 trip saw the Harvey return home undefeated, having comprehensively beaten Susquehanna Valley High School, Conklin, New York, Owego Free Academy, and Seton Catholic Central High School, Binghamton. Cricket tours to Barbados regularly take place together with the USA football tours. The Barbados tours replaced the highly popular annual cricket tours to the West Country. In the past twenty years, over 1200 students have taken part in the school's annual ski trip. Curriculum-related trips to France, form an integral part of the school's Languages programme, whilst a History trip to Ypres is an annual event. The school has a Duke of Edinburgh's Award programme, highly successful Young Enterprise groups in the sixth form, and an award-winning Debating Group. Music and Drama are also an integral part of Harvey life with various musical groups in place, an annual pantomime and regular showcase nights. An annual \\"Leavers' Ball\\" is traditionally held in conjunction with the Folkestone School for Girls each year at a large venue within the Folkestone area. This provides the opportunity for the school leavers' to come together, to celebrate their passing from school to further education or employment. The school's secret war contribution at Station X thumb Three former staff and a pupil at the Harvey worked at the once secret code breaking centre at Bletchley Park near Milton Keynes, which was recently made public and has become a tourist attraction. Their unique roles are honoured on a plaque in the school hall. The school's Headmaster Oliver Berthoud (1946‚Äì1952) was there, as was the school's long-serving secretary Miss Audrey Wind. Although they worked closely in the school it was not until a discussion one day in Mr Berthoud's office that he managed to get Miss Wind to admit to her involvement and they spoke at length about their time there. On a visit to the school in late 2006 Miss Wind commented that no one was allowed to talk about their involvement. They were sworn to secrecy and it was amazing that four Harveians had worked for Ultra during the war. She is the sole survivor of the four but now in her eighties still gives talks on the topic at functions and at the school to boys studying the period. Following her half-century of service to the school, Miss Wind became the first and only female member of the school's old boys' association.

He was the first colonial governor appointed by the Labour Party from within its own ranks. Early life O'Grady was born in Bristol to Irish parents. His father was a labourer, and after leaving school at ten, O'Grady did various lowly jobs, before training as a cabinet-maker, and became active in the Amalgamated Union of Cabinetmakers. Political career O'Grady (second from right) in 1906, with other leading figures in the party A member of the Independent Labour Party and supported by the Labour Representation Committee, he was elected at the 1906 general election as Member of Parliament (MP) for Leeds East. He had benefited from the Gladstone‚ÄìMacDonald pact negotiated between Herbert Gladstone and Ramsay MacDonald, and faced only a Unionist opponent, whom he defeated by a wide margin. O'Grady was re-elected at the elections in January 1910 and December 1910 elections, and when the Leeds East constituency was abolished for the 1918 general election, he was returned unopposed for the new Leeds South East constituency. He held that seat until he stepped down from Parliament at the 1924 general election. In the House of Commons, he spoke frequently, particularly on foreign affairs, and was noted as a strong supporter of the First World War, speaking at recruitment rallies. He was also Labour's only Roman Catholic MP. Through his role in the Amalgamated Union of Cabinet Makers, he had been President of the Trades Union Congress in 1898, and he continued his union activities whilst an MP. After a variety of posts in unions related to the furniture trades,There were many mergers of unions in that period, and craft- and area-based unions merged to form national, industry-based unions, and the union names listed in the available sources do not entirely correspond to the list of furniture unions at http://www.wcml.org.uk/tu/furnish.htm . he became general secretary of the National Federation of General Workers in 1918. Governorships In 1924, Ramsay MacDonald's First Labour Government offered O'Grady the post of British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, and he accepted.Time Magazine, 24 February 1924 He was a logical choice because he had successfully negotiated an exchange of prisoners in 1919 and had been involved in international trade union-led efforts to relieve the Russian famine in 1921, but O'Grady did not in the end get the job, because the government postponed exchanging ambassadors. Instead O'Grady became Governor of Tasmania from 1924 to 1930. The first Labour politician to be appointed as a colonial governor by a Labour government, his appointment was resisted by the Australian Labor Party, which wanted the job to go to an Australian. O'Grady was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George and moved to Tasmania, taking office on 23 December.Australian States His governorship was marked by conflicts with the Legislative Council (which urged to do more to promote economic development), and his governors reports were outspoken, but he appears to have parted on good terms. O'Grady's next appointment was in 1931, as Governor of the Falkland Islands, but he retired in 1934 due to ill-health. He died later that year, aged 68. Trivia In 1910, O'Grady and three other MPs, along with Professor Stanley Poole, formally nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize the Polish physician L. L.

His heroic conduct during the epidemic made his reputation as an important physician in the city. He shortly afterward traveled to Cincinnati to assist that city with its own cholera epidemic. Dr. Magruder was the subject of a famous anecdote that wound its way into Harper's magazine. He was attempting to talk a small boy into taking a dose of castor oil, promising him that the medicine was very sweet, when the boy replied, \\"Well, then, if it's so good, why don't you take some yourself?\\" Magruder entered public office in 1835, when he became a member of the Washington Board of Health. Two years later he was elected to the city's Common Council, then to the Board of Aldermen in 1843, where he served until 1856. In 1856, incumbent mayor John T. Towers ‚Äî a member of the controversial \\"Know-Nothing\\" American Party ‚Äî declined to seek re-election. The Know-Nothings nominated one Silas H. Hill to succeed him as mayor; the city's Democrats, Republicans, and remaining Whigs banded together as the \\"Anti-Know-Nothing Party\\" and nominated Magruder. After one of the fiercest campaigns in the history of Washington, Magruder won the mayoral election by a mere 13 votes. Magruder's term as mayor was mostly marked by improvements to the city's infrastructure, in particular building an archway over a stream that then ran near L Street and frequently overflowed, damaging the city streets. He did, however, deal with the crisis of the June 1857 Election Riots, in which the Know-Nothings recruited a street gang from Baltimore, the Plug-Uglies, to come to Washington on its local Election Day and intimidate the voters at the polls; the Plug-Uglies turned away anti-Know-Nothing voters with rocks, guns, and knives, until some citizens brought weapons of their own and the violence grew into mob rule. When the rioters reached levels of over 1,000, Magruder closed the polls and requested military aid from President James Buchanan. Before soldiers arrived, the rioters had stolen a Federal cannon and Magruder pleaded with the mob to abandon it and surrender until Navy Marines arrived and dispersed the rioters.MVSNA: In The News Magruder did not receive the Anti-Know-Nothing nomination for mayor in the 1858 election, and the coalition's new candidate, James G. Berret, acceded to the office. Magruder ran again as an independent candidate in 1860 but lost to Berret. After leaving office, Magruder continued to practice medicine until dying from a stomach infection in May, 1869. He was buried at Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington, D.C. In 1887, the William Beans Magruder School was opened on the 1700 block of M Street NW. It was closed after the 1979-1980 school year, rehabilitated and reopened as the Magruder building, part of the Seward Square office complex.

It is served by the Berlin S-Bahn line S1 and several local bus lines. It is also planned to extend the U3 U-Bahn line here. The station was erected in 1904 as one of the few genuine Art Nouveau buildings in Berlin and it is heritage listed. Its name changed several times: from Zehlendorf-Beerenstra√üe to Zehlendorf-West in 1911, to Lindenthaler Allee in 1958 and finally to Mexikoplatz in 1987.  History  The station, which was built to plans by the architects Hart & Lesser, was opened on 1 November 1904 under the name of Zehlendorf-Beerenstra√üe. Seven years later, on 15 December 1911, its name changed for the first name to Zehlendorf-West. On 15 May 1933, electric operations commenced at the station. KPEV emblem An interesting detail in a decorative manner is an elaborate emblem in wrought iron with the letters \\"KPEV\\" on the railway bridge. These letters were once widespread as an emblem, with various variants, standing for the Royal Prussian Railway Administration (K√∂niglich Preu√üische Eisenbahn- Verwaltung), thus indicating that it belonged to the Prussian state railways. In March 1934, the bridge was one of the first in Germany to be examined with the aid of X-rays and breaks were discovered in the welds under the paint. The bridge railing, including its decorative emblem, was reconstructed as part of the restoration of the entire area to plans by the architects Stuhlemmer for the 750th anniversary of Berlin in 1987. On 28 September 1958, the station was renamed Lindenthaler Allee. On 18 September 1980, the station was closed as a result of a strike by the workers of Deutsche Reichsbahn who lived in West Berlin. On 1 February 1985, the station was reopened by the West Berlin transit organisation, Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG). Two years later, in January 1987, the station's name was changed for the third time, this time to its current name of Mexikoplatz, which is named after Mexikoplatz (‚ÄúMexico Square‚Äù), which received its current name on 23 September 1959. On 1 June 2001, the Bundeseisenbahnverm√∂gen sold the station building to two Berlin businessmen. The station's bookshop, which had been operating for 25 years, was closed and regularly scheduled lectures and discussion forums in the station hall were abandoned. A citizens' initiative to convert the station into a Kulturbahnhof (‚Äúculture station‚Äù), which would have meant that the station would have become \\"a cultural meeting place\\", was unsuccessful. Future The planned extension of U-Bahn line U3 to Mexikoplatz station would turn it into an interchange between the S-Bahn (Wannsee Railway) and the U-Bahn and give it added importance. Despite the commitment to this project in land use plans, its implementation is uncertain. It is planned that the trains would terminate at the platform of the U-Bahn station and then reverse there, as currently happens at Ruhleben station (line U2 ) and Innsbrucker Platz station (line U4). The reversing facility at Krumme Lanke station would remain. A possible further extension of the U3 from Mexikoplatz towards Kleinmachnow has been abandoned due to the low forecast patronage. Connections The S-Bahn station is on the S-Bahn line S1 on the Wannsee Railway. It is possible to change to bus routes operated by Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe and Havelbus.

While it later featured some compatibility with the Wii U console, the controller was ultimately succeeded by the Wii U Pro Controller. In April 2014, Nintendo discontinued production of both the Classic Controller and Classic Controller Pro. History When the Wii Remote was first revealed in September 2005, Nintendo announced a controller \\"shell\\" which resembled a traditional game controller, often referred to as a \\"classic-style expansion controller.\\" As described at the time, the Wii Remote would fit inside the shell, allowing gamers to play games using a traditional-style gamepad, while allowing use of the remote's motion sensing capability. According to Satoru Iwata, it would be meant for playing \\"the existing games, Virtual Console games, and multi-platform games.\\" Early demos of the Wii's capabilities, showed two players competing in what appears to be Wii Sports with one player using a Classic Controller and another using two Wii Remotes, though this cross functionality was dropped. Super Famicom Classic Controller During E3 2006, Nintendo introduced the Classic Controller (model number RVL-005), which, rather than housing the remote, instead plugs into it via a cord, in a similar fashion as the Nunchuk. It contains two analog sticks and two extra shoulder buttons: the ZL and ZR buttons. The overall configuration is similar to that of other major seventh generation console gamepads. In November 2007, Nintendo listed a special Super Famicom Classic Controller as one of the choices for the free gift for 2007 Japanese Club Nintendo platinum members. In 2010, a similar SNES Classic Controller was made available on Europe's and Australia's Club Nintendo service. The Wii U Pro Controller has been developed for the Wii U console, the Wii console's successor. Despite the visual similarities, it is not compatible with the Classic Controller; however, some Wii U games are compatible with the Classic Controller instead of or in addition to the Pro Controller, especially games with flexible control schemes such as Mario Kart 8 and Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. The Wii U Pro Controller is not supported in any Wii commercial software, but it can be in Wii homebrew. Design The Classic Controller is plugged into the Wii Remote in order to be used. It features two analog sticks, a D-pad, face buttons labeled \\"a\\", \\"b\\", \\"x\\" and \\"y\\" (in lowercase), similar to that of a standard SNES controller. Analog shoulder buttons labeled \\"L\\" and \\"R\\", and two digital \\"Z\\" buttons (labeled \\"ZL\\" and \\"ZR\\") are located more closely to the center axis on their respective sides. It also has a set of \\"‚Äì\\", \\"Home\\" and \\"+\\" buttons like those on the Wii Remote, with the \\"‚Äì\\" and \\"+\\" buttons additionally labeled \\"Select\\" and \\"Start\\", respectively. The body of the Classic Controller measures tall, wide, and thick. The body of the controller contains slots on the underside, opened via a button at the top of the controller; the function of the slots was never officially clarified, although third-party gaming accessory manufacturer Nyko released a clip which holds the remote to the classic controller. In addition to a grip shell, the clip contains storage for the controller's three foot cable. While the only color available for the Classic Controller in most markets was white, a limited edition teal and gray version was released in tandem with Monster Hunter G in Japan in 2009, and in 2010, Sonic Colors was bundled with a blue version in Australia. Uses The Classic Controller can be used with the Virtual Console as well as with certain Wii and WiiWare games. Along with the Nintendo GameCube controller, the Classic Controller is one of the controllers required to play certain Virtual Console games, such as SNES or Nintendo 64 titles, which require more buttons (and an analog stick in the case of the Nintendo 64 games) than the Wii Remote. However, the Classic Controller cannot be used to play GameCube games. When in the Wii Menu, the left analog stick takes control of the cursor when the Wii Remote is not pointed at the screen. The Classic Controller can navigate through the Message Board, settings menus, and Wii Shop Channel, but becomes inactive on all other channels except for the YouTube channel which the directional button is the only way to navigate through YouTube (except for using keyboard). While the Classic Controller is used, the Wii Remote it is connected to can still be used by another player, which can allow certain Wii games like Bust-A-Move Bash and SpeedZone to support up to eight players in multiplayer mode, with two players sharing one of the maximum four Wii controllers that can be linked to the console at once. As the Wii U supports Wii Remotes, this controller is also compatible with that console, and some Wii U-specific games support it as well, such as Trine 2: Director's Cut. The Classic Controller can also be used to navigate the Wii U home screen and menus. The Classic Controller is also compatible with the NES Classic Edition and Super NES Classic Edition. Other versions=Classic Controller Pro Goldeneye 007 Classic Edition are bundled with a limited edition gold-colored Classic Controller Pro In early 2009, Nintendo announced the Classic Controller Pro which functions the same as the original Classic Controller with the exception of the shoulder buttons, which are now digital trigger- shaped buttons arranged vertically rather than horizontally. Instead of a SNES controller, this one is shaped more like a GameCube controller, and has an overall layout almost identical to a Sony Dual Analog Controller for the PlayStation. Physical changes include the ZL and ZR buttons, which are now full shoulder buttons, the addition of grips underneath the controller for additional stability, and analog sticks which are spaced farther apart than the original. The cord is positioned on top of the controller rather than the bottom, and the spring-loaded attachment slot underneath the original model was removed. The Pro version was first released to Japan in August 2009 in white and black versions. It was subsequently released to Europe and North America in November 2009 and April 2010, respectively (though only in black in Europe). The black version is available bundled with Monster Hunter Tri, Pro Evolution Soccer 2010, and SD Gundam Gashapon Wars. In addition to the standard colors, a black version with gold-colored artwork on the face was available bundled with Samurai Warriors 3 in Japan, and a completely gold- colored version is available bundled in the GoldenEye 007 Classic Edition. A red version was packed with limited copies of Xenoblade Chronicles in Europe, and was eventually released separately in Europe as well.Classic Controller Pro - Red (Wii): Amazon.co.uk: PC & Video Games.

Retrieved on 2013-08-23. The L and R shoulder buttons are also no longer analog as they were on the original Classic Controller. Wii U Fight Pad controller Accessory maker PDP began releasing a line of officially licensed \\"Wired Fight Pad\\" controllers in 2014. Behaving identically to standard Classic Controller Pro models, they are based on the design and layout of the GameCube controller, but with the \\"+\\", \\"-\\", \\"Home\\", and dual shoulder buttons that the GameCube controller lacks. On launch, they were released in Super Mario themed variants, including Mario, Peach, Luigi and Yoshi-colored versions. Four more variants, featuring Donkey Kong, Link, Samus, and Wario themes were released in February 2015, followed by Metal Mario, as well as Toad and Zero Suit Samus as GameStop exclusives. \\"Classic Edition\\" controllers In July 2016, Nintendo announced the miniature NES Classic Edition, packaged with one controller based on the original NES controller. Later in June 2017, Nintendo announced the miniature Super NES Classic Edition, packaged with two controllers based on the original SNES controllers depending on the region. Like the Super Famicom Classic Controller released by Club Nintendo, both controllers feature a connector similar to Nunchucks and Classic Controllers. The controllers for the NES Classic Edition and Super NES Classic Edition can be plugged into their respective consoles. They are also compatible with the Wii and Wii U, as the controllers are recognized as Classic Controllers when plugged into a Wii Remote, which can be used to play Virtual Console games on Wii and Wii U. While the controllers are also technically compatible with Wii and Wii U games that support the Classic Controller, it can be difficult or impossible to properly play certain games with these particular controllers because of the simple, primitive button layouts of the NES and SNES controllers they represent, with both controller lacking the Classic Controller's analog sticks, the Z shoulder buttons and the HOME button, and the NES controller lacking the SNES controller's shoulder buttons and two extra face buttons. Legal issues Anascape Ltd filed a lawsuit against Nintendo claiming that the Classic Controller and other Nintendo devices violated Anascape's \\"six degrees of freedom\\" interface device patent. In July 2008, the court ruled in favor of Anascape; Nintendo was ordered to stop selling the Classic Controller in the United States until further notice. Nintendo exercised the right to continue selling the Classic Controller pending a verdict at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On April 13, 2010, Nintendo won the appeal, and the previous court decision was reversed.

Fardell was a Councillor for Dubbo City Council between 1999 and 2005. Political career Following the 2004 death of independent Tony McGrane, Fardell was elected to represent Dubbo at the subsequent by-election. At the time, the by-election was seen as a test of the NSW Nationals, who had held the seat for 17 years prior to McGrane's election in 1999, while Fardell presented herself as \\"capable of working with any party and not having to toe the party line\\". Labor, which had not held the seat since 1959, did not field a candidate, and federal independents Peter Andren and Tony Windsor supported Fardell in her campaign. In the final result, Fardell picked up 49.3% of the primary vote, with 56% on a two-party preferred basis. She was returned to office in the 2007 state election, winning 41.66% of the primary vote with both major parties once again running, and served as a member of parliamentary standing committees on public works and road safety.

Cox, the President of the New Zealand Dental Association, proposed a system of school clinics operated by the state and staffed by 'oral hygienists' to address the dental needs of children between the ages of 6 and 14 years. At the time, the idea was considered to be unorthodox, but in 1920, at a special meeting of the New Zealand Dental Association, 16 members voted for the adoption of school dental nurses with 7 opposed to the proposal. Such a drastic change in the voting could be accredited to the refusal of New Zealand troops during the first world war. The recruits were rejected due to rampant and uncontrolled dental diseases.[Dental therapists. (2011). Dental Abstracts, 56(4), 179-181. doi:10.1016/j.denabs.2011.05.010] School dental nurses were to provide diagnostic and restorative services to children '...in a rigidly structured set of methods and procedures which spare her the anxiety of making choices'.Satur, Julie (2009), \\"The development of the dental therapy profession\\", Cited from http://adohta.net.au/contents_uploads/file/Dental_Therapy_History.pdf 15/12/2013 In Great Britain, during the first world war, 'dental dressers' were used to carry out examinations and treatment for children in parts of England. Their role was eliminated by the Dentist Act of 1921 because of hostility to the role on the part of the dentist profession. They were later re-introduced, on the strength of the New Zealand scheme, as dental therapists when the high dental needs of children were 'rediscovered' in the 1960s, carrying out similar services but under the prescription of a dentist who carried out the examination and care plan. The success of New Zealand's program was so significant that many countries facing similar needs adopted programs which mirrored the ones initially established in New Zealand. School dental services which followed similar training became popular in countries such as Canada, South Africa, the Netherlands (temporarily), Fiji, Hong Kong, Malaysia and the Philippines and in 2000, 28 countries around the world utilised dental therapists. In today's modern day practices, in all previously mentioned countries dental therapists are becoming more recognised and employable due to the identifiable need for dental professionals in underserved areas. Training=Australia Dental therapists are no longer trained in Australia, and instead oral health therapists are being trained. An oral health therapist is trained as both a dental therapist and a dental hygienist with a focus on health promotion and disease prevention. Oral health therapy training occurs at university level and therefore completion of secondary schooling to a high standard is mandatory, including certain pre- requisite subjects that differ between states/territories and between the universities that offer the courses themselves. This specific information can be found at https://web.archive.org/web/20140126105917/http://jobguide.thegoodguides.com.au/occupation/Oral- Health-Therapist The training varies, depending on what is offered at each university, but the golden rule is that once graduated an oral health therapist can only perform what they have been formally trained in. Oral Health Therapists are trained to perform: * Educate and motivate children and the community * Dental examinations * Cleaning teeth * Restoring teeth * Local anaesthetic * Extracting deciduous (baby) teeth * Taking radiographs (X-rays) * Preventive treatments ‚Äì fissure sealants, fluoride applications, oral hygiene instruction * Taking impressions for mouthguards * Refer complex problems to dentists * Educate school canteens about health foods * Liaise with other health care professionals Dental Therapists use number of different tools and technology to complete their dental tasks such as X-ray equipment, hand powered tools such as drills and polishers alongside with the use of computers and printers to record and store data. The average salary of a Dental Therapist in Australia is generally $1150.00 per week being full-time and before tax. A benefit of working in this profession is that Dental Therapists work normal hours such as 8am-5pm, Monday to Friday. New Zealand Since 2002, dental therapists are trained exclusively at either University of Otago in Dunedin (at New Zealand's only Dental School) or at Auckland University of Technology. The qualification (Bachelor of Oral Health at Otago, Bachelor of Health Science in Oral Health at AUT) enables graduates to register and practise as both a dental therapist and dental hygienist. Prior to this, development of the dental therapists began in New Zealand. They were initially trained as \\"dental nurses\\" providing preventive and simple restorative care to children aged up to 12 years old. They were employed to treat children at a school dental service including treatment of pre-school children.Nash DA, Friedman, J. W., Kardos, T. B., Kardos, L. R., Schwarz, E., Satur, J., Berg, D. G., Nasruddin, J., Mumghamba, E. G., Davenport, S. E., and Kentucky, N. R. Dental therapists: a global perspective. International Dental Journal. 2008;58:61-70. From 1921-1990 the Department of Health ran the Wellington School for Dental Nurses, which offered a 2-year Certificate. In 1952 this programme was extended with the creation of the Auckland School for Dental Nurses, and in 1956 it was again extended by opening the Christchurch School for Dental Nurses. Both Auckland and Christchurch Schools closed in 1981. In 1991, the training of Therapists was taken over by the Department of Education. Training continued in Wellington, at Wellington Polytechnic. The qualification offered was a 2-year Certificate in Dental Therapy, although in 1995 this was changed to a 2-year Diploma in Dental Therapy. In 1999 University of Otago took over the 2 year Diploma in Dental Therapy, which was offered until the introduction of the BOH degree in 2007. In 2002, both University of Otago and AUT debuted 3-year Bachelor of Health Science degrees. The Otago degree was endorsed in dental therapy, while the AUT degree was in oral health, but still only allowed for registration as a Therapist. At Otago, this was offered in addition to the 2-year diploma. Both degrees were discontinued in 2007. The current 'dual degree' was introduced at AUT in 2006 and at Otago in 2007. This was in response to a shortage and increased legislative requirements. In order to practise, all therapists must annually register with the Dental Council. For the 2014-2015 cycle, the cost of this is $758.23. One Therapist is represented on the Council for a three-year term. Dental therapists in New Zealand work exclusively with children under 18 years old. Their duties include examination and routine dental treatment and prevention work, such as fillings, fissure sealants and extractions of first teeth. Duties may also include giving local anaesthetic and taking X-rays. Therapists also advise patients and their parents how to care for the patient's mouth. Dental therapists generally work for a local District Health Board (DHB), but some work in private practice. Dental therapists can become members of the New Zealand Dental & Oral Health Therapists Association. The association was founded in 1935, as the New Zealand State Dental Nurses‚Äô Institute. United Kingdom Training can be obtained through two courses, a combined Dental Hygiene and Therapy 27-month full-time course or a Bachelors in Oral Health Science 3-year full-time course; once qualified a therapist must be registered with the General Dental Council.\\"BDA\\" The therapists have a large focus on patients' self care, creating home care plans and identifying areas where patients express deficits in efficacy of plaque removal. Dental therapists in the UK are often employed in the community dental profession and perform a range of treatment, as outlined in their professional scope of practice. Some of the procedures carried out by UK dental therapists include examinations, taking radiographs (X-rays), fillings (restorations), implementing preventive strategies (fluoride application, dental sealants (fissure seals), oral hygiene instruction) and dental health education.Gibbons, D. E., Corrigan, M. and Newton, J. T. (2000). The working practices and job satisfaction of dental therapists: findings of a national survey. British Dental Journal, 189(88), 435-438. United States The United States are increasing employment and training opportunities for dental therapists in order to reduce to the need and to increase access to care for Americans. Alaska, Minnesota, Maine, and Vermont are the four main states that are advocating dental therapists into their communities. These dental therapists can perform a number of basic clinical dental treatment and preventive services under the general and indirect supervision of dentists. The dental therapist as a member of the oral healthcare team can provide restorative dental treatment services, disease prevention and oral health promotion programs. These procedures include exposing radiographs/X-rays, administering local anaesthetic, administering nitrous oxide, application of topical preventive or prophylactic agents including fluoride varnishes and fissure sealants, preparations and restorations of primary and permanent teeth, repair of defective prosthetic devices, and recementing of permanent crowns.https://mn.gov/boards/assets/NEW_DentalTherapistSCOPE_tcm21-285567.pdf For the scope of practice https://mn.gov/boards/assets/NEW_DentalTherapistSCOPE_tcm21-285567.pdf Responsibilities The following tasks are regularly performed by Dental Therapists. * Educate patients, parents, schools and communities about the progression of dental disease, how to prevent dental disease and how to maintain good oral health. * Treat patients via giving comprehensive oral examination, dietary advice, help to modify any risk factors for dental disease, give oral hygiene instruction to patient and parent/guardian, remove and fill Dental caries. Extract deciduous (baby) teeth under local anaesthetic, perform Pulpotomy treatment on indicated deciduous teeth, take radiographs of the patient's teeth, provide dental sealant protection when necessary, administer fluoride therapy and provide a professional clean. * Refer and Communicate - dental therapists are able to refer to a dentist when a problem becomes complex, they work within schools, including canteens in recommending healthy options for students and staff. They can give oral hygiene instruction to classes and can communicate with other health care providers i.e. Immunisation clinics and maternal health care nurses. Role within the dental team The dental profession involves the study, diagnosis, prevention and treatment of diseases, disorders and conditions involving the oral cavity and surrounding structures.[Health Workforce Australia 2011, Scope of Practice Review Oral Health Practitioners] Dental therapists practice in a team situation alongside a practising dentist and have a tradition of being part of the dental team primarily to provide dental care to children through school dental services. The dental therapists role in the dental team can include the provisions of oral health assessment, treatment planning, management and prevention for children, adolescents and adults, which is dependent on their training. In many practices dental therapists are limited to the provision of restorative dental care and extractions to those aged 25 and under, however there are some settings where the dental or oral health therapist can provide these services to someone of any age where the clinician has developed his or her scope of practice. For around forty years in Australia, dental therapists have been practicing under guidance of dentists providing diagnostic, preventive, restorative and health promotion services to children and adolescents.Satur, Julie; Gussy, Mark; Marino, Rodrigo; Martini, Tamsin, (2009), \\"Patterns of Dental Therapists Scope of Practice and Employment in Victoria, Australia\\", Journal of Dental Education, 3(73), pg. 416-425. Common procedures performed by dental therapists include examination, prescribing and exposing intra and extra oral dental xrays, administration of local anaesthesia, preparation and restoration of carious lesions, pulpal therapies, extraction of deciduous teeth and preventive therapies such as fissure sealants and fluoride application. Oral health education and promotion also plays a large part in the dental therapists role. Professional support for the role of the dental therapist in the dental team has been widely accepted in Australia and New Zealand, where their role came about in response to population need from the rising numbers of caries prevalence in children.[Robinson, PG., Dyer, TA., & Teusner D. (2012). \\"The influence of population oral health on the dental team.\\" Community Dental Oral Epidemiology. 40(2), p. 16-21.] This same support has not followed in all countries, with the United States referring to dental therapists as ‚Äòlower level practitioners‚Äô with a study showing 75% of US paediatric dentists not knowing what a dental therapist was and 71% of them disagreeing to add them as part of the dental team.  Typical Day as a Dental Therapist  The typical day as a Dental Therapist can vary due to the different employers and state regulations, however Dental Therapists will primarily follow the same tasks; * Examining (check-up) the teeth of children and adolescences that may need to be treated for dental disease * Providing a dental treatment for children which can include cleaning teeth, X-rays, fillings for teeth that may have cavities, fissure sealants which can prevent cavities, extraction of deciduous (first) teeth by local anesthetic, and generally education for children about teeth health and care * Referring dental issues that are not handled by Dental Therapists such as Orthodontic work, to an Orthodontist. * Educating and encouraging healthy teeth care habits to children in the clinic and classroom * Recommending healthy food choices to parents and children so they can look after their oral health * Filing and recording information about children's teeth  Qualities and attributes  There are many qualities and attributes that are needed to be a Dental Therapist, especially because they find themselves working with young children day to day, some of these are; * Ability to work cooperatively within a team environment * Precise verbal and written communication to talk to colleagues, children and parents * Hand-eye coordination that is precise * Be able to build trust with young children, make sure they do not feel threatened or afraid * Soft and gentle personality that is open and willing to talk to others See also * Dental hygienist * Dental technician * Denturist * Dentist References Dentistry occupations ","title":"Dental therapist"},{"id":"9566522","text":"The Shops at Mission Viejo (originally the Mission Viejo Mall) is a shopping mall located in Mission Viejo, California. It is the southernmost mall in Orange County and is anchored by 2 Macy's locations, Nordstrom & a vacant space last occupied by Forever 21. The Shops at Mission Viejo is managed by Simon Malls, who owns 51% of it. History The mall opened in 1979 as the Mission Viejo Mall, anchored by Bullock's, May Company, J.W. Robinson's, and Montgomery Ward. Both Robinson's and May Company became Robinsons-May in 1993 while Bullock's became Macy's in 1996. In the year 1999, it underwent a $150 million renovation and expansion that brought many new retailers, including Nordstrom (replaced Montgomery Ward) and Saks Fifth Avenue. In 2000, Macy's remodeled and expanded the store while Robinsons-May consolidated the two stores as one, closing the former J.W. Robinson's store down (gutted out into a food court) and expanding the former May Company store. In 2006, the newly expanded Robinsons-May store became a second Macy's store, devoting it into a women's and home store. The other Macy's store formerly Bullock's became a men's, children's, and furniture store. Since remodeling/expanding, The Shops at Mission Viejo has featured a mix of upscale and mid-tier retailers, including the country's second Microsoft Store. It was during this renovation where the mall adopted its current name. In 2010, Saks Fifth Avenue closed, which later became Forever 21 (closed in 2019 due to bankruptcy). In addition to renovating and expanding, Simon Malls signed 10-year leases with many stores to secure its investment.

In 1992, the federation conducted various professional level competitions, such as the national league championship and the cup. While being an associate member, the Football Federation of Kazakhstan was not permitted to participate in official international competitions for national teams, therefore in mid to late 1992 and April 1994 it participated in regional competitions along with its former Central Asian companions of the Soviet Union from Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan.Kazakhstan International Matches - Details 1992-1999 In 1994 the F.F.K. was finally accepted as a full member of FIFA and the AFC. The decision to join the AFC was taken after a vote. The first national team match with a team outside Central Asia took place in December 1995. The same year Oleg Litvinenko, representing Kazakhstan, was recognized as the best Asian player (for the month of October). In 2000, the Football Federation of Kazakhstan became a candidate member of UEFA, and obtained its full membership on 25 April 2002 at the UEFA Congress in Stockholm, Sweden. In 2008, the federation established a major U-17 tournament, the Kazakhstan President Cup. Spain won it in 2014 and 2015.

First Tower  The Guaita is the oldest of the three towers, and the most famous. It was constructed in the 11th century and served briefly as a prison. It was rebuilt numerous times and reached its current form in the 15th century during the war fought between San Marino and the House of Malatesta.  Second Tower  The Cesta is located on the highest of Monte Titano's summits. A museum to honour Saint Marinus, created in 1956, is located in this tower and showcases over 1,550 weapons dating from the Medieval Era to the modern day. It was constructed in the 13th century on the remains of an older Roman fort.  Third Tower  Montale The Montale is located on the smallest of Monte Titano's summits. Unlike the other towers, this one is not open to the public. It was constructed in the 14th century. It is thought to have been constructed to give protection against the increasing power of the Malatesta family in that region.

Plantin was suspected of Calvinist sympathies, although Antwerp at that time was firmly Catholic. He developed a plan to prove his loyalty to the Catholic king Philip II of Spain by producing a polyglot version of the Bible, in five languages. The king promised to finance the project ‚Äî completing it nearly bankrupted Plantin ‚Äî and sent the Spanish theologian Benito Arias Montano to Antwerp to watch over the production of this eight-volume of printing, which was printed in 1,200 copies on paper and 12 copies on parchment. Printing the Bible required thirteen printing presses and fifty- five men to run them, as well as expert linguists who acted as proofreaders. The first four volumes contain the Old Testament. The left page has two columns with the Hebrew original and the Latin translation, the right page has same text in Greek with its own Latin translation. Underneath these columns there is an Aramaic version on the left-hand page and a Latin translation of this on the right-hand side. For printing the Hebrew text Plantin used among others Daniel Bomberg's Hebrew type, which he had received from Bomberg's nephews.The type is still extant in the Plantin-Moretus Museum in Antwerp. See: Albert van der Heide, Hebraica Verita. Christopher Plantin and the Christian Hebraists, Antwerp: Plantin-Moretus Museum, 2008, Exhibition catalogue, p. 155. Volume 5 contains the New Testament in Greek and Syriac, each with a Latin translation, and a translation of the Syriac into Hebrew. Volume 6 has the complete Bible in the original Hebrew and Greek, as well as an interlinear version that has the Latin translation printed between the lines. The last two volumes contain dictionaries (Hebrew-Latin, Greek-Latin, Syriac-Aramaic, grammar rules, list of names, etc.) that were of value to scholars. A complete copy of this Bible is on display at the Plantin-Moretus Museum (the site of the original printing press), including the typefaces which were designed for this project.

It is part of the otogi-z≈çshi genre of tales dating to the Edo Period or earlier. Some of the fabulous accounts are also told in the military pseudo-chronicle, Taiheiki (14th century). He used bow and arrow to kill a giant centipede (mukade) which wrapped around a mountain near Lake Biwa, fulfilling the request of a serpent at a bridge, which turned out to be a court lady (or Dragon King) from the underwater . The hero was entertained at the palace and received rewards including armor and sword, and an inexhaustible bag of rice. \\"My Lord Bag-O'-Rice\\" is English-translated title of Basil Hall Chamberlain's retelling, published as a fairy tale (1887). This was later followed by Yei Theodora Ozaki's translation \\"My Lord Bag of Rice\\" (1903) based on 's retelling. Setting The story is set in ≈åmi Province (Shiga Prefecture), and begins with a large serpent lying on on the brink of Lake Biwa. The serpent, which later assumes human form, conveys Hidesato to the Dragon Palace, which can be reached through the depths of this Lake. There is a Shinto shrine near the Seta Bridge at Lake Biwa where people have venerated Tawara T≈çda. Figure Tawara T≈çda ‰øµËó§Â§™ \\"Rice-bag T≈çda\\", a pun between tawara \\"straw rice-bag; straw barrel\\" and the Japanese name or place name , was the nickname given to the historical Fujiwara no Hidesato who flourished in the first half of the 10th century and participated in the suppression of the rebel usurper Taira no Masakado. The nickname is sometimes styled \\"Tawara [no] T≈çta\\". Summary The hero's centipede-slaying legend as contained in the Tawara T≈çda monogatari (\\"The Tale of Tawara T≈çda\\") was widely circulated and read during the early Edo Period (17th century), when the text was being copied in picture scrolls (emaki) and appearing in Otogiz≈çshi type woodblock- printed (and hand-copied) books. A summary of the monogatari version is as follows: The monogatari version probably derives from earlier accounts of Hidesato's centipede slaying described in the 14th-century Taiheiki, expanded with layers of legendary and religious (Buddhist) motifs. The above summary is not the entirety of Tawara T≈çda monogatari, which contains a second part where the hero triumphs over Taira no Masakado, despite the latter having an iron body which was invulnerable except at the temples on his head, and having six ghostly doubles of himself. Taiheiki version The 14th-century Taiheiki records a much earlier version of this legend about Hidesato,Taiheiki, Book 15 Â§™Âπ≥Ë®ò Â∑ªÁ¨¨ÂçÅ‰∫î, Chapter 118 \\"About the Battle of Miidera Temple, etc. ‰∏â‰∫ïÂØ∫ÂêàÊà¶‰∏¶ÂΩìÂØ∫ÊíûÈêò‰∫ã‰ªò‰øµËó§Â§™‰∫ã\\". but instead of the dragon turning into a beautiful woman, it transforms into a \\"strange small man\\" ‚Äì the Dragon King himself. And here, Hidesato is invited to the Dragon Palace first and thereafter combats the centipede that attacks the aquatic realm. Here the inexhaustible silk and rice bag are received from the Dragon King, but not the copper alloy pan/pot, only the copper temple-bell. Other attestations A version (similar to the monogatari) appears in (1711) as pointed out by Dutch Japanologist . The centipede coiled seven and a half turns around Mount Mikami according to popular tradition. An early written mention of this occurs in the area guidebook ≈åmi yochi shiryaku (1723). The name has been ascribed to the sword given by the Dragon King in the Wakan sansai zue encyclopedia (1712) and the almanac (1797).Noted by Hidesato's alleged armor from the Dragon Palace bore the similarly scripted name according to the Ujisatoki (before 1713).: \\"the characters are extremely similar ÊñáÂ≠ó„ÅåÁîö„Å†„Çà„Åè‰ºº„Å¶„Çê„Çã\\"Noted by Minakata Kumagusu (1916) J≈´nishik≈ç: Tawara T≈çda ry≈´g≈´-iri no hanashi ÂçÅ‰∫åÊîØËÄÉ Áî∞ÂéüËó§Â§™Á´úÂÆÆÂÖ•„Çä„ÅÆË©±; , an armor with the same-sounding but differently written name, is listed as a gift of Dragon Palace in Arai Hakuseki's Honch≈ç gunkik≈ç (1709); this work mentions a second armor being obtained as well.Noted by ; . Although not an attestation of the entire story, a sword named purportedly owned by Hidesato according to the inscription borne on its tang was bequeathed to the Ise Shrine. The Ise Shrine () also houses a or \\"tweezer type\\" that allegedly belonged to Hidesato. Fairy tale translations An English version of the tale entitled \\"My Lord Bag-O'-Rice\\" (1887) was translated by Basil Hall Chamberlain, and published as Japanese Fairy Tale Series No. 15 by Hasegawa Takejir≈ç. (1887)Reprint: An otogibanashi (Japanese fairy tale) version entitled , retold by appeared in the 1890s.; Subsequently, \\"My Lord Bag of Rice\\" was included in Japanese Fairy Tales (1903) anthologized by Yei Theodora Ozaki. Ozaki's version is a retelling based on the rendition by \\"Sadanami sanjin\\", the misspelled alias of Iwaya Sazanami.: \\"..¬ªSadanami¬´. This name is a misprint of the nom de plume of Sazanami Iwaya\\". Ozaki's book was illustrated by Kakuz≈ç Fujiyama. \\"My Lord Bag of Rice\\" is also found in A Book of Dragons (1965) by Ruth Manning-Sanders, illustrated by Robin Jacques.

Webster is the former Chief General Manager of the Toronto Transit Commission in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Education and early career Webster graduated from Queen's University as a civil engineer in 1975 and joined the Toronto Transit Commission soon afterwards. He served in various supervisory and management roles at the TTC, including in the subway and equipment maintenance departments, in the Transportation department, as Manager - Materials and Procurement (1986‚Äì1990), Manager - Service Planning (1990‚Äì1994), Manager - Human Resources (1994‚Äì1996), and General Manager - Operations (1996‚Äì2006). TTC Chief General Manager On June 10, 2006 he replaced Rick Ducharme as Chief General Manager on an interim basis after Ducharme's resignation. A year later, on June 27, 2007, Webster was confirmed in the post on a permanent basis. He was the first TTC Chief General Manager to be promoted from within the organization; all five previous holders of the position had been hired from outside the TTC. Termination In February 2012, Webster was called before City Council with regard to the future of transit planning in the city. He answered questions relating to whether subway or light rail transit would be more favorable. His testimony was not supportive of Mayor Rob Ford's position that underground was the only way for Toronto to move forward. In early February 2012 TTC Commissioners Norm Kelly, Vincent Crisanti, Frank Di Giorgio, Denzil Minnan-Wong and Cesar Palacio signed a petition for a special Commission meeting that was held on February 21 to discuss a \\"personnel issue\\". The \\"personnel issue\\" related to Webster's future as General Manager at the TTC, and he was fired. A vote by the board ousted Webster 5-4. His firing provoked outrage by some fellow Toronto city councillors. On February 23, 2012, the Toronto Star reported that according to his contract, Webster would be paid more than $560,000 in salary (plus benefits) over two years, in compensation for being fired without just cause.

Born in Burnley to Jack and Margaret Hollows, Hollows' first headship was at Calverton Primary School in Newham in 1994, pupils' performance was very poor. By 1999, when the primary school results were published, Hollows had raised the score 11-year-olds achieved across the three subjects in the national curriculum tests to 269 ‚Äì up from just 45 in 1994. It marked out the school as the most improved in the country.

Having raised its performance from well below to well above the national average, Calverton became the most improved school in the country, despite most of its pupils being from families for whom English is not a first language.

They were designed by film director Sean Casey. On May 27, 2013, the TIV2 filmed the inside of a tornado in Kansas with Casey inside. TIV 1 The Tornado Intercept Vehicle 1 (TIV 1) is a heavily modified 1997 Ford F-Super Duty cab & chassis truck used as a storm chasing platform and built by Sean Casey. This heavily armored vehicle can drive into a weak to relatively strong tornado (EF0 to EF3) to film it and take measurements. Work began on the TIV in 2003 and took around eight months to finish, at a total cost of around US$81,000. TIV's armored shell consists of 1/8‚Äì1/4 inch steel plate welded to a two-inch square steel tubing frame. The windows are bullet resistant polycarbonate, measuring thick on the windshield and thick on the sides. The TIV weighs approximately fully loaded and is powered by a 7.3 litre Ford Powerstroke turbocharged diesel engine manufactured by Navistar- International, otherwise known as the International T444E. Four hydraulic claws are used to anchor the TIV during an intercept, these lower into the ground and grapple onto the ground anchoring it. The vehicle's speed was limited by the factory Ford PCM, giving it a top speed of . The TIV has a fuel capacity of , giving it a range of around . The TIV is featured in a series called Storm Chasers which began airing on the Discovery Channel in October 2007.SouthCoastToday.com: On 'Storm Chasers': In pursuit of twisters TIV was succeeded in 2008 by TIV 2, but returned to service to finish out the 2008 storm chasing season after TIV 2 suffered mechanical problems. In a June 2011 interview with NPR's All Things Considered, Casey said that TIV is still in service and is designated as the backup vehicle in the event TIV 2 breaks down during a shoot. TIV 2 Casey and his team developed and built the second Tornado Intercept Vehicle, dubbed TIV 2, to be featured in their next IMAX movie and the Storm Chasers series.KSWO, Lawton, OK - Wichita Falls, TX: News, Weather, Sports. ABC, 24/7, Telemundo - Tech students help build tornado vehicle Work began in September 2007 by forty welding students at the Great Plains Technology Center in Lawton, Oklahoma and was completed in time for the 2008 tornado chase season. TIV 2 was designed to address some of the problems experienced with the original TIV, namely its low ground clearance, lack of four-wheel drive, and low top speed. It is based on a Dodge Ram 3500 that was strengthened and converted to six-wheel drive by adding a third axle. After season two the six-wheel drive system was modified to four-wheel drive. It is powered by a 6.7-liter Cummins turbocharged diesel engine, modified with propane and water injection to produce . This gives TIV 2 an estimated top speed of over . Its fuel capacity is , giving TIV 2 an approximate range of . The body of TIV 2 is constructed of a 1/8-inch steel skin welded over a square tubing steel frame. The windows in TIV 2 are all bullet-resistant interlayered polycarbonate sheets and tempered glass. TIV 2 also features an IMAX filming turret similar to the one on the original TIV. The original TIV's somewhat cumbersome hydraulic claws were not used on TIV 2 in favor of six hydraulic skirts that drop down to deflect wind over the TIV to stabilize it and protect the underside from debris, and four hydraulically operated anchoring spikes. TIV 2 debuted on the second season of Storm Chasers, which began airing on the Discovery Channel in October 2008. Its initial performance did not go well, as it was plagued by mechanical failures, including several broken axles, which forced Casey to abandon TIV 2 and return to chasing in the original TIV until TIV 2's issues could be resolved. Although Casey hoped he would be back in TIV 2 before the end of the season, repairs and modifications on TIV 2 took longer than expected and Casey was shown on Storm Chasers ending the season in the original TIV. In the fall of 2008, TIV 2 received several modifications, mostly focused on reducing the vehicle's weight. To achieve this, certain less crucial areas of TIV 2's armor were converted from steel to aluminum while more vital areas were reinforced with supplemental composite armor consisting of thin layers of steel, Kevlar, polycarbonate, and rubber. In all, the weight reduction measures brought TIV 2's weight down to . The safety systems were also improved, with the three front wind skirts being consolidated into one and new hydraulic stabilizing spikes to further increase stability in high winds. Other modifications included additional doors that provided every seat position with an exit (wind skirts up or down), and a redesigned IMAX turret with 50% more windows. The third axle was disconnected from the drive train, thus changing TIV2 to 6√ó4 from its 6√ó6 design. The third axle now acts as a brace for the vehicle's weight. The TIV 2 appeared again in the fourth season of Storm Chasers, and also in an episode of another Discovery Channel series, Mythbusters, wherein both the TIV 2 and the SRV Dominator vehicle operated by Reed Timmer of TornadoVideos.Net were tested to determine their endurance to storm-force winds by being parked behind a Boeing 747 with the engines at full throttle. When tested at a wind speed of , the TIV 2 had the driver's door pulled open, though this was due to human error, as Casey forgot to lock the door prior to the test. When tested again at (equivalent to an EF5 tornado), the TIV 2 suffered no ill effects other than the anchoring spikes being slightly bent; the Dominator ended up being blown approximately , although it remained upright. In 2011, a siren was added to the vehicle to allow the TIV 2 to act as a mobile warning system for civilians in the path of incoming tornadoes, after several incidents earlier that year where the TIV team was unable to effectively warn locals of the imminent danger of the tornadoes they were tracking, especially during the 2011 Super Outbreak. On April 27, 2011, the TIV 2 team intercepted an EF4 tornado that hit near Enterprise, Mississippi, while not in the path but 200 yards from it, it was the first tornado he shot with his new stereoscopic IMAX camera. Casey removed the rear flap in early 2012 and built a new set of two hydraulic spikes that go into the ground during an intercept. On May 27, 2013, TIV 2 intercepted a large tornado near Smith Center, Kansas. The vehicle was struck by large debris from a nearby farm and suffered damage to the roof-mounted anemometer and at least two breaches of the crew compartment when the roof hatch and one of the doors were compromised. Before the anemometer was disabled, it recorded winds of , placing the tornado in the EF3 to EF4 range. On October 21st, 2019, Casey listed the TIV 2 on Craigslist for $35,000 USD and was later sold to storm chaser Ryan Shepard who plans on restoring it and using it in future chases. Instrumentation Although primarily designed to shoot film from near or within tornadoes, the TIV's have at times been outfitted with meteorological instrumentation atop masts to complement the Doppler on Wheels (DOW) radar trucks of the Center for Severe Weather Research run by atmospheric scientist and inventor Joshua Wurman.

Le ren√©gat) is a short story written in 1957. It is the second short story published in the volume Exile and the Kingdom by Albert Camus. Plot summary \\"The Renegade\\" is one of the most obscure and confusing of the short stories published in Exile and the Kingdom. It is presumed to be an allegory.Camus's \\"Le Remegat\\": An Allegory of the Existentialist Pilgrimage The story begins with the narrator, who we are told has somehow lost his tongue, waiting in the desert with a rifle. Much of what the narrator says at the beginning of the story is not explained until much later. After the opening pages in the desert which are set in the narrator's present, the narrator recounts events from his past which begin to explain his present nature and situation. The narrator, a French Catholic from the Protestant Massif Central region, left his home to work as a Christian missionary to the Tribes in the closed city of Taghaza, Mali. His mentor warns him that he is not yet ready for such a task but in his self-confessed 'pig- headedness' he decides to go anyway. Upon arrival, his guide turns on him and robs him leaving him in the desert. The narrator has more misfortune in store as he arrives at Taghaza and is imprisoned and beaten by the men and women of the Tribe. After several days of isolation he is taken to the House of the Fetish where the tribe's priest and several men and women engage in worship rituals in front of Fetish. During the rituals the narrator and several others are physically and mentally abused. Eventually the narrator is converted by the tribe that he came to convert. He disowns Christ, refusing to believe in his righteousness and declares that the Fetish and the power of hatred are the only true and flawless powers in the world. The narrator relates of one day when the priest without his mask brings a woman into the House of the Fetish. The woman has a tattoo across her face in the image of the Fetish and is left prostrate on the floor in front of the fetish itself as the priest leaves. It is implied here that the narrator attempts to engage with the woman (although nothing explicit is described) but is caught by the priest who returns with several tribesmen. They beat him and remove his tongue, causing him to pass out on the floor. Some time later the narrator learns that another missionary is to be sent to look after the children in Taghaza but that a garrison of twenty French soldiers is to be maintained to ensure the missionary's safety (possibly a result of the narrator's disappearance). Upon learning this, he decides to escape the day before the missionary is due to arrive, steal a rifle and kill him. In killing the missionary, the narrator intends to instigate a conflict between the French and the Tribe. Although it seems this is not to effect revenge on his captors but to give the tribe a chance to conquer and spread throughout Europe. Eventually the missionary and his guide appear on the horizon and the narrator fires on them. Wounding his target, the narrator closes in and beats the missionary to death. The narrator comments on how good it feels to strike the face of goodness with his rifle butt. As soon as the new missionary is dead the tribesmen come for the narrator; alerted by his gunfire. The story ends with the recapture and torture/execution of the narrator. The narrator compares himself to the martyred Christ; asking why the Fetish has forsaken him and declaring his love for the nails which crucify him. When the narrator realizes that the Fetish is not coming to save him and the powers of \\"good\\" are winning, he wonders if he's made a mistake and chosen the wrong side. He hastily tries to convert back to the side of good and mercy, but as he babbles his narration ends. The narrative switches to a third person point of view for the closing line: \\"A fistful of salt fills the mouth of the babbling slave.\\" Style The style Camus employs in \\"The Renegade\\" is representative of the fictional narrator and can sometimes be difficult to decipher. The story is written in the first person perspective and just like the narrator, the language is muddled, disjointed and disorganized; leaving the reader to piece together the facts from the hysterical and neurotic monologue. Motifs Camus stated: ‚ÄúI do not believe in God and I am not an atheist.\\" In his essay \\"The Myth of Sisyphus\\", Camus states that religious faith is a form of suicide; a distraction from the real in which the individual embraces the Absurd and abandons reason and logic. In \\"The Renegade\\", Camus portrays the Absurd nature of religion. The events which cause the narrator the most suffering: the loss of his tongue, his presumed execution and his decision to leave his home and travel to Taghaza are all results of him making decisions which to him seem right according to his religious beliefs at the time. There is also the Absurd juxtaposition between the perceived right of religion and the violent and harmful means which the tribe and the narrator use to achieve it. Present also, is the Absurd notion that virtue creates sin. In the house of the Fetish, the Tribe presents the woman to the narrator, the woman submits to him and the tribe do not attempt to stop him but after the narrator has acted on his urges he is immediately and severely punished. At the end, when the narrator compares himself to Jesus on the cross, there is also the parallel that the narrator's actions will be the cause of further bloodshed. Throughout the story there are themes of dominance and oppression. The narrator travels to Taghaza with the intention of converting the natives to his own beliefs. Once captured by the tribe the narrator is oppressed physically and mentally by his captors until he bends to their will. At several points, the narrator also says that he wants to be offended, he wants to be oppressed, so that he can fight back and take control of his actions and his life by overcoming the adversities set against him.

It is located on the Lyublinsko- Dmitrovskaya Line, between and stations. Sretensky Bulvar opened on 29 December 2007 after more than 25 years since groundbreaking.  History  The construction, which began in the late 1980s, has frequently stalled as a result of continuous lack of funds. Only in 2004 did proper funding resume, which allowed finishing the construction. The station opening had been long- awaited, as it is an interchange: Chistye Prudy of the Sokolnicheskaya Line and Turgenevskaya of the Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya Line. The projected passenger dynamics for the station are 10,800 per hour on entry and 20,100 on exit, which allows for a dramatic occupancy decrease on the Koltsevaya Line, particularly on the Komsomolskaya ‚Äî Kurskaya path.  Design  The station, designed by architects N. Shumakov and G. Mun, features a standard Lyublinskaya pylon-trivault design with the base set as a monolith concrete plate. White fibreglass is used on the vaults of the central (9.5-metre diameter) and the platform halls (8.5 m) as well as the escalator and transfer corridor ceilings, which also doubles the hydroisolation. Initially it was thought that the station's main decorative feature would include a set of bronze and rock sculptures in the niches of all 30 pylons. Made by leading Russian sculptors, they would stand on granite pedestals with luminescent lamps lighting down on top of them. However, recently it has emerged that this would be too costly, and hence the pylon design was altered to now include a set of metallic artworks on themes of the Boulevard Ring. White marble covers the floors, whilst flooring are done with granite. Platform of the station. There are two escalator tunnels leading from both ends of the station: one directly to Chistye Prudy station, and the other to a combined transfer to Turgenevskaya as well as a diversion to a second escalator tunnel to the surface. The combined vestibule will be located underground the Turgenevskaya Square at the beginning of Academician Sakharov Avenue and next to the Sretensky Boulevard for which the station is named. In an effort to conserve the spendings and time, the vestibule and the escalator tunnel to the surface will open later.

(Fraktur font); Schippeitaro (in Latin font online at zeno.org). The story of \\"Schippeitaro\\" (1888) as told by Mrs. T. H. James (Kate James), was number 17 in the \\"Japanese Fairy Tale Series\\" printed by Hasegawa Takejir≈ç, who issued many such chirimen-bon or \\"crepe-paper books\\". Mrs. James's version follows a storyline identical to Lang's version.Cf. the text itself:  Synopsis  Below is the summary of the Lang/Mrs. James version:, A young warrior wandered the land in search of adventure, eventually finding an enchanted forest, wherein he slept in a shrine (or chapel). He was awoken at midnight by ferocious yowls from cats, who were dancing and yelling, some saying, \\"Do not tell Shippeitaro!\\" He got up and continued on, eventually finding a village where he heard a female voice lamenting and pleading for help. He was told that every year they had to sacrifice a maiden to the spirit of the mountain, and it was this girl's turn this year. She was put in a cage (or cask) which, in turn, was placed in the shrine. He inquired about Shippeitaro: a dog of the prince's overseer, living nearby. The warrior visited the overseer and persuaded him to lend him the dog. He went to the cage, replacing the maiden with Shippeitaro. The cage was brought to the shrine, and the cats came. A huge black cat opened the cage, and Shippeitaro jumped out and killed it. Then, with the help of the warrior, killed several others before they fled. The warrior brought Shippeitaro back to his owner in the morning, and every year a feast was held in honor of the warrior and Shippeitaro.  Variants  The Lang/Mrs. James version which features cats as the antagonists is actually atypical. In most Shippeitaro tales, the malevolent spirits appear as monkeys (or baboons). An example of \\"Shippei Taro\\" published in Keigo Seki (ed.), Robert J. Adams (tr.), Folktales of Japan (1963) had been collected in Monou District, Miyagi. The priest in the story defeated the ogres (whose remains were those of dead monkeys) by replacing the sacrificial maiden inside the chest with the dog Shippei Taro, found in the distant city of Nagahama, ≈åmi Province. Seki himself collected a number of variant tales from the field. When Seki published Nihon mukashibanashi taisei (1978), his provisional count reached 67 examples. This tally was inclusive, even counting tales where the dog helper did not appear at all. The dog may or may not have a name at all. And the name is not entirely consistent. The dog's name may be only a slight variant of Shippeitaro, such as (, or an alternate reading (Takeberatar≈ç) or altogether different. The dog may be Shippeitar≈ç/Suppe(i)tar≈ç from ≈åmi or Tanba or some other province. In several examples, the dog appears as or of temple in Shinano Province. According to one scholar the name Shippeitar≈ç tends to occur near T≈çtomi Province (Shizuoka Prefecture), while Hayatar≈ç is concentrated in Shinano Province (Nagano Prefecture). It has been observed that in Shinano dialect, denoted \\"wolf cub\\", which probably gave rise to the name Heib≈çtar≈ç, and Hayatar≈ç may well be a further corruption of this. The evil spirits may be in the form of monkey, cat, rat, badger or \\"raccoon dog\\" (mujina, tanuki).; (table); (table) Old printed book thumbupright=1.5Shippeitaro breaks out of his box and destroys the wolves. There is also a kiby≈çshi type printed book from the Edo Period, the Z≈çho Shippeitar≈ç (1796) meaning the \\"expanded version\\" that was written by with illustrations by ukiyo-e artist Toyokuni. This book illustrates spirits of the monkey, fox, kappa, tanuki (raccoon dog), hare, and wolf kind devouring the human sacrifice, and in the culminating scene depicts Shippeitar≈ç defeating wolves.  Precursor  In the medieval anthology Konjaku Monogatarish≈´ occurs a similar story of a sacrifice-demanding monkey god, entitled \\"How in Mimasaka Province a God was Trapped by a Hunter and Living Sacrifice Stopped\\". The Shippeitaro tales have been considered orally transmitted versions of this medieval prototype., citing . Konjaku Monogatari tale, p. 55‚Äì and passim; Shippeitaro comared p. 298. English translations of this medieval version is found in S. W. Jones's Ages Ago: Thirty-Seven Tales from the Konjaku Monogatari Collection (1959), and Michelle Osterfeld Li's study Ambiguous Bodies. A similar tale is also included in another medieval anthology, the Uji Sh≈´i Monogatari. Tale type In Japanese folklore studies, the \\"Shippeitar≈ç\\" story is classed under the tale type , categorized as Type 91 by Seki in his paper written in English., note 26 This general tale group is more broad, and includes tales where a dog is not involved at all. The tale group (Sarugami taiji) is assigned Seki No. 256 (NMBS = Nihon mukashibanashi sh≈´sei II; NMBT=taisei.) in Japanese scholarship. Since the story concludes with the heroes abolishing the practice of offering maidens as human sacrifice, it draws a parallel to the legend of Saint George and the Dragon, and there are certain similarities also to the story of Susanoo saving Kushinadahime from the great serpent Yamata no Orochi. In the Aarne‚ÄìThompson classification, the tale is classed as \\"The Dragon Slayer\\" type, AT300.

It was created by the Dutch software company Aduna as part of \\"On-To-Knowledge\\", a semantic web project that ran from 1999 to 2002. It contains implementations of an in-memory triplestore and an on-disk triplestore, along with two separate Servlet packages that can be used to manage and provide access to these triplestores, on a permanent server. The RDF4J Rio (RDF Input/Output) package contains a simple API for Java-based RDF parsers and writers. Parsers and writers for popular RDF serialisations are distributed along with RDF4J, and users can easily extend the list by putting their parsers and writers on the Java classpath when running their application. RDF4J supports two query languages: SPARQL and SeRQL. RDF4J's RDF database API differs from comparable solutions in that it offers a stackable interface through which functionality can be added, and the storage engine () is abstracted from the query interface. Many other triplestores can be used through the RDF4J API, including Ontotext GraphDB (built as a SAIL), Mulgara, and AllegroGraph. Through the stackable interface, functionality can be added to all of these stores. It can, for example, be used to add indexing and query capabilities to all compatible stores: * Free text search capabilities can be added through the LuceneSail. * Geospatial (GeoSPARQL) and free text search can be added through uSeekM. RDF4J In May 2016, Sesame officially forked into an Eclipse project called RDF4J, in recognition of Aduna no longer being involved in its development.

The type species, Angelosaurus dolani, is known from a partial skull from the Middle San Angelo Formation, Knox County, Texas, USA dating from the Kungurian (Early Permian). The specimen represented an individual that was from three to three and a half metres long and weighed about 300 kilograms. Like its contemporary Cotylorhynchus, another caseid, it was large, heavily built, and herbivorous. It also shared its environment with the caseids Caseoides and Caseopsis. It may have been preyed upon by the large sphenacodont pelycosaur Dimetrodon. Like all caseids, Angelosaurus was an evolutionarily conservative synapsid which would appear to have been one of the dominant herbivores of the time, occupying a similar ecological role to cows. Caseid skulls are distinguished from other pelycosaurs by large temporal openings, large nasal and pineal openings and an upper jaw that distinctively overhangs the teeth of the lower jaw. The skull is pitted. The teeth are uniform. The body was probably barrel- shaped, like other caseids, with massive limbs and small cervical vertebrae. And unlike the better-known pelycosaurs such as Dimetrodon and Edaphosaurus, caseids do not have the exaggerated elongation of the vertebrae that form a sail. Two other species of Angelosaurus have been described so far: Angelosaurus greeni Olson 1962, and Angelosaurus romeri Olson and Barghusen, 1962.

The court ruled: The result of this ruling is that no right-to-manage company can apply to manage multiple blocks on an estate. The right relates to a building, so, in an estate of separate blocks, each block would need to qualify separately and an individual RTM notice served. In the case of an estate of flats under the same management, it would be sensible to take over the management of the whole estate, but this would have to be accomplished by application in respect of each separate block. The duty to transfer funds The legal obligation of the freeholder or previous management company is to pass forward any unspent funds. In practice, if these are less than ¬£2,000, it may not be economic to pursue them through the courts, but ultimate determination can be made by a leasehold valuation tribunal.Residential Property Tribunal Service: Home Freeholder's membership of the right-to-manage company Immediately upon the RTM company taking over on the acquisition date, the landlord (freeholder) becomes entitled to membership of the company, with full voting rights as a company member (if they wish to take it up). The landlord's votes are, in the first instance, determined according to the units they hold in the building, flats or non- residential parts. In cases where they hold no units, and therefore would have no votes, they are allocated one vote as the landlord. As the right to manage is not default-based, there is no reason why the landlord, who retains an interest in the building, should not have some input to the practicalities of its management. It is different where the manager has been appointed by a tribunal to replace a poor or incompetent manager ‚Äì there the landlord is removed entirely as a consequence of his mismanagement. With the right to manage, it is assumed that the landlord is not necessarily at fault and so there is no justification for his exclusion from the management process.http://www.leaseadvice.org/documents/Right_to_Manage.pdf References Law of the United Kingdom Real estate in the United Kingdom Real property law ","title":"Right to Manage"},{"id":"9567227","text":"right Viridovix was the chief of Unelli, a Gallic tribe which faced the legions of Julius Caesar at the time of the Roman conquest of Gaul, between 58 and 51 BC.

The similarities between the two artists was often brought up on the Japanese Internet forum 2channel. Her characters have large, wide eyes with a certain amount of sharpness, as opposed to being more rounded, which are widely spaced apart on the face. A distinct feature often added to her bish≈çjo characters is the use of long, thin ribbons attached to the hair or clothing. Clothing, especially Japanese school uniforms, is often simple in design but very diverse, such as in regards to collars, sleeves, or skirt hems.

St. Paul's is known for its traditional style of worship as embodied by its renowned choir. The church has as its vision statement: \\"To be a cathedral for the city of Houston, embodying its diversity, inspiring faith, and leading change for the common good of all peoples and communities.\\" History At the beginning of the 20th century, members of Houston‚Äôs Methodist community worked toward organizing a new congregation on what was then the burgeoning south end of town. In December 1905, individuals met at the J.O. Ross family home and held Christmas Eve services at the city auditorium. The congregation officially organized on January 14, 1906, with 153 charter members. Bishop Joseph Key preached the first sermon and suggested the congregation adopt St. Paul‚Äôs as its name. The Ross family gave lots at the corner of Milam and McGowen streets for a new building. The church building was designed by R.D. Steele and consecrated in January 1909. The structure reflected a Grecian design with a dome reminiscent of Byzantine architecture. The church grew along with the city of Houston, and in the late 1920s, members launched a campaign to raise money for new and larger facilities. Jesse H. Jones, Walter Fondren Sr., and James Marion West Sr. each contributed $150,000, and the church hired noted architect Alfred C. Finn to design a new building at the corner of Main and Binz streets. The Neo- Gothic styling features a cruciform plan on a steel-frame structure with limestone cladding. Stained glass windows are from the original structure, and the tower houses bells also brought from the church‚Äôs original sanctuary. It has been described as \\"one of Houston's grandest houses of worship.\\" In the 1950s the church started a Mothers Day Out program serving very young children up to age 3. In 1973 St. Paul's Preschool was launched, serving 3 and 4 year olds, and a kindergarten program was added in 1982. St. Paul's Preschool is accredited by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC). The Bankston Green, dedicated in September 2014 in honor of retired pastor Jim Bankston and his wife Sandy, is a new plaza on church property adjoining the city's Museum Walk. It includes wider sidewalks, green areas, enhanced seating and lighting, and a pavement labyrinth. The project has been given the Landmark Award by the Mayor‚Äôs Proud Partners program of Keep Houston Beautiful. Programs St. Paul's is known for a strong emphasis on social justice issues and radical hospitality. For example, an advocacy group called Texas Health Care For All advocates for the creation of a single payer health care system in the United States. The Rev. Dr. Jim Bankston, who served as pastor from 1995 until his retirement in June 2013, was an outspoken advocate for immigration reform and a leader in the Breaking the Silence movement to welcome all people into the church and to ordain members of the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender (LGBTQ+) communities.

The two middle schools that feed into Central are Blountville Middle School and Holston Middle School. The school's mascot is the cougar. The current principal is Loren Foster.  History  The school opened in 1968 with its main building and eventually expanded by means of a classroom addition and a vocational building in 1978. The only construction since that time has been a football fieldhouse, which opened in the fall of 1997.  Athletics and electives  The school has athletic teams in all traditional varsity sports, including football, swimming, soccer, basketball, track, cross country, tennis, baseball, softball, volleyball, and Marching Band. Despite its relatively small enrollment, the school fields three men's basketball teams and two to three women's basketball teams in the same divisions. The majority of Central athletics maintain intense rivalries with the other three Sullivan County schools, South, North, and East High Schools, and in select sports with the local city schools of Dobyns Bennett, Tennessee High and Science Hill.  Cheerleading  Sullivan Central High School has tryouts every spring for Varsity, Junior Varsity, and just recently, Competition Team members. A new edition to Central includes a Varsity Twirling team that performs at Varsity Football and Basketball games. The Varsity cheerleading squad cheers for the Varsity football team, and Varsity Boys' Basketball team. The Junior Varsity cheerleaders cheer for the Junior Varsity football team, as well as the Varsity Girls' Basketball team.  Swimming  The heat to the Sullivan Central Pool went out in 2008. This is related to then-principal Melanie Riden asking for the pool to be closed in a meeting with Sullivan County in October 2008. The swim team then had to practice at sister school Sullivan North High School. The pool was reopened in January 2011, and was dedicated to Bradley Brock, a senior who died of cancer in September 2010.  Band  From its beginnings in the early 1970s, the Sullivan Central High School Band has become an integral part of the school and the surrounding community. The Cougar Band program consists of approximately 100 students performing in various groups and ensembles.  Football  The Sullivan Central High School Cougars have only won 12 games since the 2010 season.  Faculty and administration  Central High School has a total of 76 teachers and administrators. The principal is Mr. Loren Foster. Assistant principals are Mr. Justin Calhoun, and Mrs. Amy Mumpower.  2010 shooting  On August 30, 2010, around 8:30 a.m., The Student Resource Officer assigned to the school, Carolyn Gudger, first noticed a suspicious person \\"driving towards the back of the building\\",First-hand interview from Carolyn GudgerInterview and asked his purpose for being there. She pulled alongside the car to ask if the man \\"was lost\\" and \\"what he needed\\". The driver claimed that \\"his brother worked here\\". The Officer then entered the building, went to her office, checked in and proceeded to walk with the principal to the front office to confront the man, Thomas Richard Cowan (aged 62). He waited briefly to speak with the principal, Melanie Riden. The gunman pulled his weapon after talking briefly with the principal, and Ms. Gudger immediately pulled her issued pistol and distracted him long enough to get the principal, Melanie Riden, to safety. The Officer ordered him to put his gun down. After leading him to an empty room, then a hallway, he began rambling about the government and political issues. He attempted to pull a fire alarm in order to \\"get these kids out of here\\". Gudger kept talking to him while holding her pistol on him. His patience seemed to wane and he said, \\"Lady, I don't want to have to shoot you\\". After Cowan closed one eye, and appeared to contemplate firing, Gudger heard an order from the police. \\"Sheriff's office! Put the gun down!\\". The Sullivan County Sheriff's Office had arrived. The man aimed at officers and was then shot when he aimed his weapon at the S.R.O. The suspect was the only person injured and was airlifted to a local hospital, where he later died.

In February 2007, Colombian Senator Jorge Enrique Robledo suggested another term, \\"parauribismo\\", indicating that the scandal was mainly affecting officials or political allies of President √Ålvaro Uribe's administration.

Five governors and 32 lawmakers, including Mario Uribe Escobar, President Uribe's cousin and former President of Congress, were convicted. Background Relations between politicians, government officials, security forces, other sectors of Colombian society and paramilitary groups have developed for years, resulting in the latter's infiltration of Colombian politics and government. According to the newspaper El Tiempo, one of the paramilitary leaders involved, Rodrigo Tovar Pupo, sought to achieve total power in the Atlantic Coast and eventually over Colombia.

In 2001, some 32 people, including members of congress, politicians, paramilitary leaders and others, met at Santa Fe de Ralito in order to sign a secret document known as the Pact of Paramillo Knot or as the \\"Pact of Ralito\\". The text of the document called for \\"refounding the country\\", signing a new social contract and maintaining national independence, among other statements. When the document's existence was revealed in late 2006, participants such as former congresswoman Elenora Pineda have argued that the document sought to be a contribution to the search of peace in Colombia.

He also mentioned that \\"the nation needed to know the links between politicians and the guerrilla groups\\" and that \\"the judicial and political search for truth for past and present events done by guerrillas and paramilitaries should be supported\\" On November 29 prior to a debate in Congress, president Uribe reasserted that penal responsibility was individual and that it was necessary to investigate politicians with ties to guerrillas. He also commented that the suspect congressmen were being accused for acts perpetrated before he assumed the presidency in 2002 as a way of distancing himself from the growing scandal. On the same day, the former Interior Minister during President Samper's administration and prominent Liberal Party leader, Horacio Serpa, called for the Chamber of Representative's Commission of Accusations to investigate President Uribe's possible links to paramilitaries.

Political reform to tackle parapolitics On April 9, 2008 the √Ålvaro Uribe Administration supported a political reform law, presented by some congressmen, to tackle the growing scandal of parapolitics in the Colombian Senate. By then 51 Congressmen were suspected of parapolitics. 29 of them were in jail awaiting trial. The government proposed the \\"Empty Chair\\" solution; Senators that are suspended or jailed for alleged ties with illegal armed groups may not be replaced by their political parties. This way the parties would be forced to keep their fraction \\"clean\\". A majority of the Colombian House of Representatives agreed with the law. The biggest opposition party Polo Democr√°tico Alternativo, also one of the few parties not affected by the scandal, voted against the law, saying the current legislative chambers have no credibility to solve the problem. On April 16, 2008, one day after the vote in the House, Senator Carlos Garcia, President of the Partido de la U, began to be officially investigated under suspicion of paramilitary ties. Garcia resigned from his Partido de la U position, but said he would not quit Congress.

History of the game=The beginning In the 19th century, billiards was a popular pastime among the British Armed Forces stationed in India. Two of the most popular games were black pool and pyramid pool. Black pool is a gambling game which involved as many coloured balls as there were players along with a black ball. Each player owned a coloured ball which serves as his cue ball but is an object ball to the others. If it is potted he must pay the striker who is then allowed to pot the black ball. If he succeeded, all opponents must pay him. A good player will alternate potting a coloured ball and the black ball to maximize winnings. Balls are respotted after being sunk. In pyramid pool, there were 15 red balls and a white cue ball, and each player received one point per red ball potted. In 1875, at the British Army Officer's Mess in Jubbulpore (now Jabalpur), Central Provinces, Colonel Sir Neville Francis Fitzgerald Chamberlain suggested combining the two games. The new game was beginning to resemble snooker in its current form, though the blue and brown balls were added in later years. The name snooker comes from a comment Chamberlain made about a player who missed a shot. He called him \\"a real snooker\\", referring to his lack of experience, \\"snooker\\" being a slang term for a first year cadet. The first official set of rules for snooker were drafted in 1882 at Ootacamund in Madras Province. When British Billiards Champion John Roberts travelled to India in 1885, he met Chamberlain and decided to introduce snooker to England when he returned home. The early years The first official competitions, the English Amateur Championships, took place in 1916. In 1927, Joe Davis helped to establish the first Professional World Championship of snooker. Joe Davis won and took home the prize of six pounds and ten shillings. At that time, the standard of play was not very high considering that the highest break of that tournament was just 60. By the 1930s, Snooker was becoming one of the most popular cue sports. Joe Davis continued to dominate the era, winning every World Championship until his retirement in 1946. Between 1952 and 1957, a dispute had arisen among the games' governing body, the Control Council, and the Billiards Association. As a result, only two people participated in the official 1952 World Championship. Due to a decline in popularity, there were no world championships between 1958 and 1963. Rise in popularity In 1969, the BBC launched the Pot Black tournament at the BBC Studios in Birmingham, which proved to be very successful in helping put snooker back into public view. The BBC began broadcasting in colour and were looking for programmes that could exploit this new technology. The programme first aired on 23 July 1969, on BBC2. Pot Black was a British series of (non- ranking) snooker tournaments televised by BBC which played a large part in the popularisation of the modern game. In 1972, a twenty-three year old Alex 'Hurricane' Higgins clinched the first of his two World Titles and through a mixture of bravado, charisma and an ability to make headlines helped to popularise the sport in the new age of colour television. The event continued until 1986, returned in 1990, but was discontinued after the 1993 event. Pot Black was revived in the form of several one-off tournaments throughout the 1990s and up to 2007. Pot Black helped transform snooker from a minority sport with just a handful of professionals into one of the most popular sports in the United Kingdom. Mark Williams holds the events' highest break record of 119. The World Championship was first televised in 1973. World rankings were introduced in 1976, and, in 1977, the World Championship was held in the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, where it has been ever since. Daily television coverage of the World Championship began in 1978. The 1980s capitalised on the sport's already growing popularity. Steve Davis dominated for much of the decade thanks to a smooth technique, all-round game, dedication, and the PR savvy of his ambitious manager Barry Hearn. Maverick left-hander Jimmy White came along as a people's champion very much in the mould of his good friend and idol Alex Higgins. The number of tournaments on the calendar was to increase further as from the 1984/1985 snooker season ITV started to televise three new ranking events, the International, Classic and British Open. In the 1985 World Championship final, heavy favourite and 8‚Äì0 early leader Steve Davis lost after a comeback by the Northern Ireland player Dennis Taylor. The 35th and deciding frame lasted for 68 minutes, Taylor sinking the final black at 12.20 a.m with a UK record audience of 18.5 million TV viewers watching. Though the record viewing figure was never topped, the 1986 World Championship final between Steve Davis and Bradford underdog Joe Johnson, in which Johnson surprisingly won 18‚Äì12, also drew a strong audience figure of 16 million. In the build-up to the 1986 World Championship, the novelty anthem \\"Snooker Loopy\\", recorded by Chas and Dave featuring the Matchroom Mob (Barry Hearn, Steve Davis, Dennis Taylor, Willie Thorne, Terry Griffiths and Tony Meo), hit number 6 in the UK Singles chart. The domestic success of snooker continued to remain strong into the late 1980s. During this time, with the help of Barry Hearn, tournaments were starting to expand globally into Europe, Asia and North America. The 1988 Canadian Masters was the first ranking event to be staged outside the UK. In December 1988, the invitational Matchplay (featuring the world's top 12 players) was the first ever professional tournament to have a ¬£100,000 winner's prize. In the late 1980s, Steve Davis' dominance was starting to be challenged by future World Champion Stephen Hendry. By the end of the decade, there were more than 200 playing professionals on the circuit, a figure which increased to more than 400 professionals during the 1990s. Standards rise, popularity slides A new generation of players came to the fore in the 1990s, most notably Stephen Hendry who went on to dominate for much of the decade. Hendry eclipsed many of Steve Davis' records including most World Championships, most ranking titles and most (BBC) major titles. Hendry's type of attacking, breakbuilding game which often clinched frames in one visit ushered in a new era of player. In 1993, at the age of 17, Ronnie O'Sullivan became the youngest ever winner of a ranking event by beating Hendry himself at the 1993 UK Championship final. Though the standard of snooker continued to rapidly increase, the immense popularity that Snooker enjoyed started to wane. ITV stopped screening ranking events after the 1993 British Open and during this period, much attributed to the economic recession, prize money totals started to stagnate or decrease for events outside the World Championship. Snooker also suffered from the recovery of football's reputation after the 1990 World Cup and especially after the foundation of the Premier League in 1992. From the mid-1990s onwards, Snooker still enjoyed decent exposure thanks to BBC continuing to televise the major events and the continuation of tobacco sponsorship. Due to the increasing restrictions or eventual ban on tobacco advertising in sport, Benson and Hedges last sponsored the invitational Masters in 2003 and Embassy's long- standing association with the World Championship concluded after the 2005 tournament. With cutbacks necessary (due to loss of tobacco funding) and fewer events, the main tour roster was reduced to 96 professionals for the start of the 2005/2006 season. Afterwards, the number of events on the circuit started to dwindle. However, since the loss of tobacco sponsorship, the online gaming and gambling industry has stepped in to sponsor numerous events on the calendar. The WPBSA chairman Sir Rodney Walker was ousted in a vote of no confidence in December 2009, which cleared the path for the longtime sports promoter Barry Hearn to attempt to revitalise the sport. Recent history Barry Hearn was appointed Chairman of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association which was reformed into a rules and regulatory body. In winning a players vote on 2 June 2010 by a margin of 35‚Äì29, Hearn also took control of World Snooker Ltd, which is the commercial arm of the sport. A number of new tournaments like the Player Tour Championship and Sky Shootout have been added to calendar. The Grand Prix tournament has been revamped as the World Open. One of the matters most relevant to the ousting of the previous WPBSA board and the return of Barry Hearn was giving the players more playing and earning opportunities. In the 2009/2010 snooker season (pre Hearn) there were 6 ranking tournaments, added with invitationals the number of events on the calendar being at around 15 competitions in total that were open to most professionals. Those players lower down the rankings required second jobs to supplement their income as the game for them had become a part-time chore. In contrast, the provisional calendar for the 2011/2012 season features 9 ranking tournaments, 13 minor ranking events under the Players Tour Championship brand and 7 invitationals which include the traditional Wembley Masters and the shot clock Premier League. The calendar increased to a record breaking 29 official World Snooker events. The sport is now a full-time profession once again. Format alterations such as Power Snooker and Six Reds also include the very top players, with these type of tournaments added to mix, there could potentially be 35 events available on the circuit for the 2011/2012 season. With an expanded tour schedule, it will give players an option to pick and choose their events, similar to the practice in other sports like tennis and golf. ITV and Sky Sports are seeking to broadcast more coverage of the sport once again. More tournaments are scheduled to take place in Asia in the coming years. The current generation of top players still includes Ronnie O'Sullivan and John Higgins. In recent years, new global talents have emerged such as Australian Neil Robertson, Ding Junhui from China and Englishmen Mark Selby and Judd Trump. Multiple World Snooker Ladies champion Reanne Evans was the first ever female to be granted a place on the main tour for the 2010/2011 snooker season. The prize money fund for each season currently stands at ¬£5 million ($8 million US dollars). The winner of the sports flagship World Championship collects ¬£300,000 ($500,000 US dollars), .

Known for the financial support he gave to the Romanian Communist Party (PCR) during the late 1930s and early 1940s, he became a political prisoner of the Communist regime after being implicated in the show trial of his collaborator Lucre»õiu PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu. Calmanovici died in mysterious circumstances in Aiud Prison, while on recovery from a hunger strike. Biography= Early life and financial success  Born to a Jewish family in Piatra Neam»õ, he was the son of Mendel and his wife Ana, who ran a business in the town.Betea, \\"Recuno»ôtin»õa...\\" A graduate of the University of Munich and the University of Berlin, where he was confronted with the establishment of the Nazi regimeBetea, \\"Procese politice\\" and became an avid reader of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin, he also amassed a fortune in his youth, owing to his real estate investments. Calmanovici decided to dedicate his wealth to the PCR cause, at a time when the party was outlawed.Betea, \\"Recuno»ôtin»õa...\\", \\"Testamentul...\\" By the end of World War II, when they were nationalized, his properties included two construction enterprises, additional shares in a logging company centered in his native town, seven apartments, and over 18,000 m2 in Bucharest real estate.Betea, \\"procese politice\\", \\"Recuno»ôtin»õa...\\" Party financier According to Calmanovici's statements, he had contributed massive sums to various PCR enterprises between 1937 (the year when he joined the group) and 1944, being responsible for the purchase of a printing press, the renovation of the Central Committee seat in Bucharest, a clandestine radio station, and a kindergarten for children of party members.Calmanovici, in Betea, \\"Recuno»ôtin»õa...\\" He estimated that his investments totaled 30 million lei in 1942 currency, which he argued was over 75% of his total income. Calmanovici took pride in noting that this contribution was by far the highest of all those recorded (including that of Jacques Berman). In addition, he contended, nationalization of his wealth had brought the state over 1 billion lei in 1947 currency. Inside the PCR, he kept only sporadic contacts with the \\"prison faction\\", a group led by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej (according to one account, during the time when Gheorghiu-Dej was held in Doftana prison, Calmanovici sent him a jacket as a gift). Instead, he was close to PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu's maverick group (later known as the \\"Secretariat faction\\"), a fact which, in time, contributed to his arrest and imprisonment (both of which were instigated by members of the \\"prison faction\\"). Late 1940s During the war, when Romania joined the Axis Powers and participated in Operation Barbarossa, Calmanovici was among those charged with establishing contacts between the Communists and other opposition groups. At the time, his relation with the pro-Allied financier Alexandru »òtefƒÉnescu helped him gain intimate knowledge of various negotiations between the National Peasants' Party (PN»ö) and the National Liberal Party (PNL) on one side and Ion Antonescu's dictatorial government on the other, as well as of the latter's tentative moves to withdraw Romania from its alliance with Nazi Germany through a compromise with the Western Allies (the 1943 unsuccessful mission of Barbu ≈ûtirbey to Cairo).Betea, \\"Recuno»ôtin»õa...\\"; note to Calmanovici's letter, in Sfera Politicii Calmanovici forwarded his information to the PCR's Remus Koffler, which helped the group approach and influence the PN»ö leader Iuliu Maniu to form an alliance against Antonescu (one which enlisted support from the Soviet Union). After the fall of Antonescu's regime and the onset of Soviet occupation in August 1944, when the PCR first entered government, Calmanovici became an esteemed party member and officially endorsed industrialist. In the spring of 1945, his Bucharest house served as a meeting place for PCR and pro- Communist forces who planned and succeeded in toppling Prime Minister Nicolae RƒÉdescu (after a series of street clashes, RƒÉdescu was replaced with the Ploughmen's Front leader Petru Groza, whose cabinet was controlled by the PCR). Following this, he was appointed a technical director of the Bucharest Constructions Institute and was involved in enforcing Soviet standards and expertise.Betea, \\"Procese politice\\", \\"Recuno»ôtin»õa...\\" Arrest Relations between Calmanovici and the PCR degenerated abruptly toward the end of the 1940s, and he was arrested by the Securitate on May 26, 1951. Several days earlier, Calmanovici had met with Constantin P√Ærvulescu. At this meeting, Calmanovici asked P√Ærvulescu to use his status as head of the Party Control Commission to grant him a decoration (Calmanovici was stiffly refused, on the grounds that such self-promotion was unprecedented). Documents involving the 1943‚Äì1944 contacts between Calmanovici, PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu, Koffler, and Maniu (who was already imprisoned on such charges following the TƒÉmƒÉdƒÉu Affair) were interpreted as evidence that the former two had been spying for the Western Allies. In full, the accusation read: \\"as an agent of the English espionage services he forwarded information about the PCR, taking part in the criminal action to destroy the party and support the anti-Soviet war\\".Rendered in Betea, \\"Recuno»ôtin»õa...\\" Calmanovici stated that, early on, authorities had presented him with the claim that he was kept in custody in order to aid in the process of compiling a history of the PCR.Calmanovici, in Betea, \\"Procese politice\\", \\"Recuno»ôtin»õa...\\" Starting in summer 1951, he was subject to a series of Securitate interrogations, which concluded that he had not contributed to hostile activities and that he was able to support his case with \\"sufficient guarantees\\". In December, Calmanovici, who had devoted his spare time to learning Russian, was supposed to be released from custody. Instead, his case was reviewed by a new group of Securitate officials, who obeyed Gheorghiu-Dej and alleged that the latter's rival, Minister of the Interior Teohari Georgescu, was not enforcing party doctrine (Georgescu was to be himself ousted in 1952). On orders from Alexandru DrƒÉghici and Vladimir Mazuru, under the supervision of several Soviet envoys, Securitate cadres were to induce Calmanovici to confess having spied in Romania during and after the World War. The officer who had originally argued in favor of his release was criticized for having displayed \\"lack of vigilance\\", and ordered to resume interrogation.Betea, \\"Recuno»ôtin»õa...\\"; Golopen»õia In several appeals to the PCR leadership (Gheorghiu-Dej, P√Ærvulescu, Chivu Stoica, Emil BodnƒÉra≈ü and others) Calmanovici repeatedly stated his innocence and dismissed accusations that he was a bourgeois figure with insufficient political education. In another personal letter, he compared allegations of espionage with those made by Alexander Kerensky about Vladimir Lenin prior to the October Revolution in Russia.Calmanovici, in Sfera Politicii Confession and trial In February 1953, Calmanovici gave in to Securitate violence and presented operatives with a fabricated account, stating that he had been part of a network of spies presided over by Milton (a name he came up with after recalling the 17th- century poet John Milton). His inquisitors soon rejected the story, and argued that it was additional proof of \\"provocation\\" on Calmanovici's part. Eventually, he agreed to sign his name to a confession drawn up by the PCR, in return for a promise that he was to be given at most a four-year sentence. It has been argued that the document endorsed by Calmanovici was directly inspired from the similar one handed over by Nikolai Bukharin during the 1938 Moscow Trial of the Twenty One. In its final form, it also incriminated Calmanovici of Zionism and spying in favor of the Western Allies (the United States, or, alternatively, the United Kingdom).Introduction to Calmgram Consequently, Calmanovici was indicted in PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu's 1954 trial, where, despite early promises, the court ultimately sentenced him to life imprisonment and forced labor.Betea, \\"Recuno»ôtin»õa...\\"; Levy, p.152; TismƒÉneanu, p.329 The sentence was given on counts of crime against peace and high treason. As PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu and Koffler were being swiftly executed in Jilava, he and the other persons sentenced (including Alexandru »òtefƒÉnescu, Petre Pandrea, Harry Brauner, Lena Constante, and PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu's wife Elena) were dispatched to the infamous Aiud prison, on their way to various facilities. Imprisonment and death Calmanovici, who was kept in almost complete isolation, managed to contact other inmates, an infraction which was added to his criminal record. As a consequence, the Securitate decided to stage a set of circumstances which were to incriminate him further: in 1955, Calmanovici was escorted out of Aiud and into a villa in SƒÉftica, where he received a humane treatment while being interrogated by Vasile PosteucƒÉ.Betea, \\"Recuno»ôtin»õa...\\"; Calmanovici, in Sfera Politicii A guard was instructed to approach him and earn his confidence, to the point where Calmanovici trusted him with carrying out a message he had written on linens; addressed to his former employees and meant to be forwarded to Jewish communists in the Western world, these exposed the fallacies and major irregularities of his trial. (In similar appeals, Calmanovici had also meant to bring his case to the attention of the Cominform.) After the guard handed the letters over to his superiors, Calmanovici was chained and moved back to Aiud. He decided to publicize his innocence by beginning a hunger strike, which eventually led physicians on duty to force-feed him. His diet at the time went against medical guidelines for people with malnutrition, and was the most likely cause of his death by gastrointestinal perforation -- two prison staff members later attested that this was done on purpose, as a method of assassination. It has also been noted that Calmanovici's signed statement according to which he was abandoning the hunger strike and was accepting the treatment, extracted only hours before his death, was immediately communicated to higher authority (unlike any other such statement of the time). Of his group, Calmanovici was the only one to die in custody (all others were released ca. 1964, when they benefited from an amnesty).Levy, p.152 Rehabilitation and legacy Like all defendants in the PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu trial, Calmanovici was rehabilitated in April 1968 by Nicolae Ceau»ôescu, following a change in policy which was meant to discredit his deceased predecessor Gheorghiu-Dej and the former Securitate chief Alexandru DrƒÉghici. The new inquiry, overseen by Ion Popescu-Pu»õuri, found that Calmanovici had been the victim of systematic abuse. Among others, it was established that Calmanovici's arrest had been operated on the basis of Gheorghiu-Dej's personal views, that the charges had for long not been communicated to Calmanovici, that Soviet agents had openly intervened in interrogations, and that, like virtually all other defendants, he had been repeatedly beaten and otherwise tortured to ensure a forced confession. Calmanovici's son became a resident and later a citizen of Sweden, becoming known under the name Gad Calmgran. He worked as a journalist, and was a collaborator for the newspaper Dagens Nyheter.

He represented England at Youth level. Playing career Chatterley was born in Birmingham and began his career as an apprentice at Aston Villa, turning professional in February 1962, with his league debut coming the following season. He remained at Villa Park for over 9 years, making 153 league appearances and scoring 26 goals. During his stay at Villa Park, Aston Villa were relegated from Division 1 in 1967 and again from Division 2 in 1970. In March 1971 he joined Doncaster Rovers on loan, where he first met Lawrie McMenemy, who was to have a considerable influence on his later career. With his time at Villa at an end, Chatterley was sold to Northampton Town in September 1971 for ¬£8,000. His stay at Northampton was only a short one, rejoining McMenemy at Grimsby Town in February 1972 for ¬£8,000. In his first season at Blundell Park, Grimsby were champions of Division 4, and spent the next 2 seasons in Division 3, finishing in a creditable 9th and then 6th place. He scored 16 times in 73 league games for Grimsby before a ¬£15,000 move to Southampton in March 1974, once again linking up with McMenemy. He played the last two games of Saints' 1973-74 relegation season. As the team struggled to shine in the Second Division, Chatterley became the butt of the crowd's frustration, and, in February 1975, he moved to Torquay United as player-coach, where he was to play a further 57 league games and score 10 goals. Coaching career After leaving Torquay he played for North Devon non-league side Barnstaple Town and opened a guest house. However, he was lured back into football, firstly as coach of Chicago Sting in the U.S., and then, in 1979, as McMenemy's right-hand-man back at Southampton. During his 6-year spell at The Dell, Saints enjoyed some of their finest moments including briefly topping the Football League tables in January 1982 (finishing the 1981-82 season in 7th place), and then finishing the 1983-84 season as runners-up to Liverpool. In 1985, he chose to accompany McMenemy to Sunderland, despite being in contention for the vacant manager's job at The Dell. McMenemy's sacking in April 1987 precipitated Chatterley's resignation from his position at Roker Park a few weeks later. He returned to the Southampton area in 1987 and was manager of The Clump Inn in Chilworth, and took a role as manager at Poole Town, before becoming Ian Branfoot's assistant at Reading in June 1988. In October 1989, he acted as caretaker manager following Branfoot's sacking, handing over the reins to Ian Porterfield in November. In January 1990, Chatterley returned to The Dell as a youth development officer, and, in July 1991, once again became a coach under Ian Branfoot who had recently been appointed Southampton's manager. In January 1994, following Branfoot's departure, he briefly acted as caretaker manager in tandem with Dave Merrington, taking charge of the team for one match, before Alan Ball's appointment. He was then promoted to the role of assistant manager, a post he retained until the appointment of Graeme Souness in July 1996. He then joined Newcastle United for a brief spell as a scout, before retraining as a teacher. From 1998 to 2016, Chatterley was full-time football coach at Winchester College. He enjoyed considerable success there, with the school reaching the semi finals of the Independent Schools Cup for the first time.

It also notes their influence on the instruments of the time period. As their sound developed with each album, and their audience expanded with each tour, John Entwistle and Pete Townshend, supported by sound engineer Bob Pridden, became known for constantly changing their stage equipment. Townshend altered his setup for nearly every tour, and Entwistle's equipment changed even more than that.Who Tabs. A detailed reference of each band member's equipment throughout their career. Keith Moon played various drum kits, recognizably 'Pictures of Lily' kit, manufactured by Premier Percussion, which consisted of one and a half kits' worth of equipment as a precaution towards his tendency to destroy parts onstage.Who Collection. Keith Moon's \\"Pictures of Lily\\" drum kit. Early rigs and Marshall Stacks In 1965, Pete Townshend and John Entwistle were directly responsible for the creation and widespread use of Marshall amplifiers powering stacked speaker cabinets. In fact, the first 100 watt Marshall amps (called \\"Superleads\\") were created specifically for Entwistle and Townshend when they wanted an amplifier that sounded like a Fender head but with much more power.Who Tabs. Pete's Equipment: The Marshall Stack. At this time, The Who were using their own precursors to the Marshall Stack with 50 watt amps; John Entwistle used a Marshall JTM45 head feeding two 4x12\\" cabinets (set up side-by-side), and Townshend had a 1964 Fender Bassman powering a single 4x12\\" Marshall cabinet set up on top of a second cab.Secrets from the Masters: Conversations with Forty Great Guitar Players, page 260, Don Menn, Backbeat Books, 1992, Around this time, Eric Clapton was using a JTM45, which he had modified into the 1962 Bluesbreaker combo.The History of Marshall, page 24, Michael Doyle, Jon F. Eiche, Hal Leonard Corporation, 1993, These rigs proved not to be loud enough for The Who as they moved into bigger and bigger venues, and in the summer of 1965 they switched to Vox AC100s; the very first (and at the time, only) 100w amps on the market, which were designed for use by The Beatles. However, in September that year, The Who's van was stolen, including all of their equipment.Who Tabs. Pete's Equipment: Vox AC-100 amplifier. Following the theft, unhappy with the sound and reliability of the Vox amps, Entwistle and Townshend approached Jim Marshall asking if it would be possible for him to make new Marshall amps for them that were more powerful than the JTM45, to which they were told that the cabinets would have to double in size. They agreed and six rigs of this prototype were manufactured, of which two each were sold to Townshend and Entwistle and one each to Ronnie Lane and Steve Marriott of The Small Faces. These new \\"double\\" cabinets proved too heavy and awkward to be transported practically, so Townshend returned to Marshall asking if they could be cut in half and stacked like his old Bassman rig, and although the double cabinets were left intact, the existing single cabinet models were modified to make them more suitable for stacking, which has become the standard over the years. Entwistle and Townshend continued expanding and experimenting with their rigs, until (at a time when most bands still used 50‚Äì100w amplifiers with single cabinets) they were both using twin Stacks, with each Stack being driven by the then-new and experimental 200w prototype Marshall Majors. This, in turn, also had a strong influence on the band's contemporaries at the time, with Cream and The Jimi Hendrix Experience both following suit. However, due to the cost of transport, The Who could not afford to take their full rigs with them for their earliest overseas tours; thus, Cream and Hendrix were the first to be seen to use this setup on a wide scale, particularly in America.The Who can be seen using rented Vox equipment in footage shot at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967. Ironically, although The Who pioneered and directly contributed to the development of the \\"classic\\" Marshall sound and setup with their equipment being built and tweaked to their personal specifications, by the time they toured America as headliners in 1968, they had stopped using Marshalls and moved on to Sound City equipment, which were as powerful as Marshalls, but had a cleaner sound, which both Townshend and Entwistle preferred. Cream and particularly Hendrix would be associated with the adoption of Marshall stacks.Those Were the Days - A Cream fansite. The Who's Marshall History. Sound City and the invention of Hiwatt amplifiers Pete Townshend smashing a Gibson SG. Behind him are a set of Hiwatt amps. Both were a staple ingredient of The Who's sound between 1969 and 1972. John Entwistle traded in his Marshall Stacks in favour of Sound City at the beginning of 1967, and Townshend followed later that year. Around this time, Jimi Hendrix and his manager Chas Chandler approached Townshend asking for his opinion on amplification. He told them that he had stopped using Marshall as he thought Sound City were better. The Jimi Hendrix Experience subsequently started using Sound City rigs, but set them up together with their Marshall Stacks instead of replacing them. In late 1968 The Who approached Dallas Arbiter, the makers of Sound City, asking if their equipment could be modified slightly. This request was denied, but independent amp designer and manufacturer Dave Reeves, a former employee of Sound City, agreed and created customised Sound City L100 amplifiers under the name Hylight Electronics. This model was named the Hiwatt DR103, which would be modified in 1970 into the CP103 \\"Super Who 100\\" model which Townshend used almost exclusively for over a decade. In 1973 the updated DR103W model was created, which has been the central piece of equipment around which Townshend's various rigs were built for the next thirty years.Who Tabs.

The Who mention Hiwatt amplifiers in the song \\"Long Live Rock\\". Rotosound strings In 1966, bassist John Entwistle was looking for a set of roundwound strings \\"which vibrated properly\\". He contacted James How of Rotosound and set up a meeting to visit their factory in London. Entwistle spent the afternoon there, trying various strings made for him by the on-site technicians in different gauges with different cores and types of wire until they found a set that he was happy with. In return for a free lifetime's supply, Entwistle agreed to allow Rotosound to market the strings they had co-developed as their flagship \\"Swing Bass 66\\" range, with a black-and-white photograph of John and James How on that day in the Rotosound factory gracing the reverse of every packet. In honour of the partnership, The Who wrote and recorded a jingle for Rotosound which appears on their 1967 album The Who Sell Out. Entwistle used these strings exclusively for the next twenty-three years until switching to gold- plated Maxima strings in 1989. In 2001 he switched back to using Rotosound until his death in June 2002.Who Tabs. John Entwistle's Gear: Strings, Picks & Action.

Despite these changes, the book was again rejected, and Alcott laid the manuscript aside. Fair Rosamond ended up in Harvard's Houghton Library.\\"Alcott, Louisa May, 1832-1888.

The difference shows: in pacing, tone, and content, Love Chase is startlingly unlike its famous successor. The ostentatiously Faustian plot centers on Rosamond Vivian, a discontented maiden who lives on an English island with only her bitter old grandfather for company and who begins the novel by rashly declaring: \\"I often feel as if I'd gladly sell my soul to Satan for a year of freedom.\\" Right on cue, a man named Phillip Tempest ‚Äî a man who bears a more than trivial resemblance to Mephistopheles ‚Äî walks in the door. Within a month, Rosamond is in love, and although she realizes that this man is ‚Äúno saint‚Äù, she marries him, believing with the fatuousness of youth that her love will save him. She sails away from her lonely island in Tempest's yacht, the Circe, and begins her married life at a luxurious villa in Nice. Much to his own surprise, Tempest, a heartless libertine, finds that he, too, has fallen in love. He tries to make Rosamond happy, and succeeds for a while; however, after a year in his company, she begins to realize how conscienceless and cruel he is. She then discovers that Tempest has a wife and son already, making their marriage a sham and Rosamond the unwitting mistress of a man who has grossly deceived her. That same night, she packs a few items, stealthily climbs down from her second-floor balcony, and catches the next train to Paris. Tempest pursues her, beginning the obsessive ‚Äúchase‚Äù of the title. Tempest hunts Rosamond for two years, telling her he enjoys the sport. To throw him off the track, she assumes a variety of disguises: in Paris, she's a seamstress named ‚ÄúRuth‚Äù; next, she escapes to a convent, where she's known as ‚ÄúSister Agatha‚Äù; after that, under the name ‚ÄúRosalie Varian‚Äù, she travels to Germany as companion to a wealthy little girl. Each time, as she begins to settle comfortably into a new life, Tempest makes a sudden, funhouse-type entrance and ruins everything. Under this treatment, Rosamond learns to hate and fear her former lover. At the same time, a hopeless passion develops between Rosamond and Father Ignatius, a handsome, virtuous, high-born man who happens ‚Äî unfortunately ‚Äî to be a Roman Catholic priest. The chase finally - tragically - ends the night Ignatius attempts to help Rosamond return to her grandfather's island. Critical reception Although Alcott wrote the novel hastily while under considerable economic pressure and submitted it under the name ‚ÄúA. M. Barnard‚Äù ‚Äî a pseudonym she used for several other Gothic thrillers ‚Äî Love Chase received good mainstream reviews in 1995, 129 years after its intended appearance as an ephemeral potboiler. Most contemporary critics choose to emphasize the strong feminist elements, fast- moving story, curiously contemporary ‚Äústalker‚Äù theme, and ‚Äî most of all ‚Äî the conspicuous lack of domesticity (in contrast with Little Women).Shaw, Mary- Liz. \\"Review\\".

S33 Phoebe-Lou Adams of the Atlantic Monthly, wondering why such an exciting and adjective-rich narrative was originally rejected, speculates ‚ÄúCould the objection have been simply that the heroine, on discovering that she has been duped into a false marriage with a murderer, fails to collapse and die of shame? Instead she scoops up the available jewels, flees by night through a window, and repudiates any guilt in the affair.

Scholarly importance Alcott's pseudonymous career as A. M. Barnard, successful writer of sensational fiction, was brought to light in the early 1940s by a rare book dealer, Madeleine B. Stern, and a librarian, Leona Rostenberg. Their discovery became widely known in 1975, when Stern dusted off some of the more interesting stories for Behind a Mask: The Unknown Thrillers of Louisa May Alcott.Alcott, Louisa May (Madeleine Stern, editor). Behind a Mask: The Unknown Thrillers of Louisa May Alcott. New York: William Morrow & Co., 1975, pp. vii-xxvii) Since then, several more such collections have been published, providing intriguing new material for literary scholars and biographers eager to reevaluate Alcott's career. The strongly feminist Love Chase seems likely to become a valued resource in this field of inquiry, with the added cachet that it was once judged too sensational for publication. In the words of reviewer Andria Spencer, ‚ÄúWhat proves so fascinating about Saxton's biography [a 1977 Alcott biography, reissued in 1996], A Long Fatal Love Chase, and ‚Ä¶ Behind a Mask is the reversal made in addressing Alcott's life and work ‚Äî the solid, upright pedagogue melts away before the image of the ardent suffragette, sole support of family and home and rebel, despite herself.‚ÄùSpencer, Andria. \\"A woman of independent means\\" (reviews).

Plot In 1938, Brad Craig (Richard Quine), the son of a famous Army colonel, starts his freshman (fish) year at the Agricultural & Mechanical College of Texas (now Texas A&M; University). After spending the past four years in the Philippines, he has acquired both an intimate knowledge of Japanese culture and a desire to invest in the modernization of Asia. At the train station, Brad is met by cadet ‚ÄúCyanide‚Äù Jenkins (Noah Beery, Jr.), his new roommate. He is also introduced to sophomore (pisshead) cadet ‚ÄúPanhandle‚Äù Mitchell (Robert Mitchum), who wastes little time in penalizing Brad for various violations of cadet conduct. As Brad adjusts to life on campus, he becomes romantically involved with Nina Lambert (Anne Gwynne), the daughter of beloved chemistry professor ‚ÄúPop‚Äù Lambert (Harry Devenport). Following an artillery exercise, Brad observes that the brakes on his section's caisson appear to be damaged. Panhandle disregards Brad's concerns and orders the section to move out. When the brakes fail and the caisson goes careening out of control, Brad risks his life to improvise a solution and prevent a disaster. His actions save Cyanide's life and earn him Panhandle's respect. Brad is soon promoted to ‚Äúfish sergeant‚Äù and his upperclassmen delight in exhausting him (smoking him out) by constantly staging fights and ordering Brad to intervene who finally discovers the game and wreaks revenge. As Brad's college career progresses, he discusses marriage with Nina who is secretly smitten with Cyanide (and he with her), though each is hesitant to disclose their feelings. During the Field Artillery Ball, Brad encourages Cyanide and Nina to dance together when they finally admit their mutual attraction. By the following year, they have become a couple with Brad's blessing. Meanwhile, Brad finds himself in a difficult position when his classmates are concerned about his support of Japan. Two Japanese- American cadets, Kubo (Allen Jung) and Matsui (Roland Got), come to his aid, their justification of Japanese war crimes angers the others and earns Brad the contempt of his friends. While guarding the chemistry building one night, Brad discusses with Pop Lambert his invention that will protect servicemen from poison gas. Pop hides the formula in his office to prevent tampering, but after he departs Brad is drugged and locked in a closet but manages to escape, seeing Kubo and Matsui ransacking the professor's office. He trails the pair and confronts their employer, a traveling salesman (William Frawley) working for the Japanese. Having taken some papers from Pop Lambert's office, Brad offers to provide the formula in exchange for a bribe but deliberately gives them a version of the formula missing a key element whose absence will render it useless. Brad is accused of treason for his actions although the commandant does not have enough evidence to bring formal charges. Ostracized by the student body, Brad decides to leave the university. Months later, Brad is working for the Japanese Navy recording English-language propaganda for distribution in the United States. He is assigned to give radio commentary on an impending Japanese assault on the Solomon Islands. The maneuver is detected and a U.S. Navy carrier group moves to intercept the Japanese fleet. While airborne to cover the battle, Brad manages to contact the U.S. fighter group, led by Cyanide, revealing his covert infiltration of the Japanese military and offering his services to the American forces. He crashes his own aircraft into the Japanese aircraft carrier, disabling the flight deck and giving the Americans the advantage. Brad dies as the carrier is destroyed and is posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.

He was the 33rd Lieutenant Governor of Nevada, from 2007 to 2015. As the Lieutenant Governor, he presided over the Nevada State Senate, chaired the Commission on Tourism, and served on the State Board of Transportation and the Reno Tahoe Winter Games Coalition. Previously, he served two terms as the Nevada State Treasurer. He is a member of the Republican Party. Krolicki was not eligible to run for a third term in 2014 due to lifetime term limits by the Nevada Constitution. Education Krolicki is a graduate of Stanford University, where he graduated in 1983 with a degree in Political Science. Professional life Preceding his election as State Treasurer, Krolicki worked for Bankers Trust in New York City, and Smith Barney in San Francisco and Manama, Bahrain. Political career=State Treasurer Krolicki was elected state treasurer in 1998. During his tenure, Krolicki worked to make college education more affordable, and considered it \\"a cornerstone of his administration.\\" He created the State Treasurer's College Savings Plan and Nevada's Prepaid College Tuition Program, and oversaw the set-up of the Gates Scholarship in Nevada. Along his work in higher-education accessibility, Krolicki obtained upgrades from credit-rating agencies for Nevada, saving taxpayers millions of dollars in interest payments. All rating agencies now consider Nevada just a notch below AAA, the highest and most coveted rating, and held by very few states. Krolicki was also the first state treasurer in the United States to receive the coveted Certificate of Excellence in Investment Policy from the Association of Public Treasurers of the United States and Canada. Krolicki also formulated and implemented many investment programs that obtained tens of millions of dollars in revenue for the state. On the national level, in 2002, Brian was unanimously elected by his peers to serve as president of the National Association of State Treasurers (NAST), which collectively represents over $1 trillion in assets. As president, he founded the NAST Committee on Corporate Governance and served as chairman of the NAST Foundation, which promotes financial literacy and education throughout the nation. He has worked hard to promote financial literacy in Nevada by introducing the Nevada Women's Money Conference, a free event designed to provide the necessary tools and information to become financially educated. In May 2004, Brian was selected by his state treasurer colleagues to receive the Unruh Award, given to the nation's most outstanding state treasurer. Most recently, in December 2004, Brian was again honored by his national peers in both the private and public sectors with the highly regarded Gritz Award for Excellence in Public Finance in recognition of his leadership and innovation in the area of public debt management. Lieutenant governor In 2006, Krolicki was elected Lieutenant Governor of Nevada. He was re-elected in 2010. Prosecution by Nevada Attorney General On December 3, 2008, Krolicki was indicted on four felony counts. The charges were related to Krolicki's management of a multibillion-dollar college savings program in his previous position as Nevada's state treasurer. Two of the counts were of misappropriation and falsification of accounts by a public officer, and two counts were of misappropriation by a treasurer. He faced up to four years in prison on each of the four counts for a maximum of sixteen years. Krolicki said there was no basis for the charges and called them a partisan political tactic by Democratic Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto and U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. A Las Vegas judge later dismissed the charges, exonerating Krolicki and his Chief of Staff Kathy Besser.

It lies at an elevation of 976 m. In 2019 it had 198,600 inhabitants. It is located 170 km on the Victoria Falls road from Bulawayo to Victoria Falls Geography Lupane is a rural, semi-arid area, which cultivates cotton and corn. A new university has been established under the name Lupane State University, which caters for the rest of Matebeleland North Province. The word Lupane is a Kalanga/Lozwi word. The region has been explored for Coal Bed Methane (CBM) and a resource of over is thought to exist with a purity of 95% methane. Lupane town is the main centre for the district and is the location of the Matebeleland North government head offices. It also houses the Provincial hospital (under construction). History In the years since 2000, there has been nearly 200 cases of torture by the militias of the ZANU-PF. The Bubi-Lupane Dam was built in 2010 on the Bubi River in order to supply water to Lupane District.Work on Bubi-Lupane Dam resumes A water treatment plant is also being built.Water treatment plant construction resumes Education Lupane is home to Lupane State University, located within the vicinity of the town along the A8, the Victoria Falls road. Fatima High School has been in a long time offering Advanced Level, the government in recent times established Advanced Level in Secondary schools to improve tertiary education enrolment within the region and beyond. The notable Secondary schools to benefit were Mabhikwa, Sibambene, Amandlethu and Zwangendaba High Schools.thumbSome schools within the vicinity regions have also utilised the establishment of Advanced Level facilities that may be seen as a benefit to improved enrolment at Lupane State University. Regina Mundi Mission Secondary School located at Gwayi Siding train station has been rated one of the best schools in producing Ordinary Level graduates. There are 29 Secondary Schools in Lupane offering ZIMSEC Ordinary Level School leaving certificates. The pass rate is seen as being lower due to the rural location of schools offering challenges to learners who travel longer distances and the under equipment of schools. There are 105 primary schools scattered around Lupane district, offering ZIMSEC Grade 7 Examinations, entrance to Form 1 at secondary schools. The issue of non-Ndebele Teachers teaching at Primary Schools, predominately Lupane being a Ndebele speaking region has been a subject of discussion by scholars citing contributory factor to poor performance. Infrastructure=Road networks The central location of Lupane in the Matabeleland North Province played to the advantage of being the choice of a Provincial Capital. The road networks mainly managed by ZINARA and Kusile Rural District Council through District Development Fund (DDF), is the main mode of transport for people and goods, as the area has no sea or rail system within the vicinity of its town. The main road passing through Lupane Town is the A8, popularly called the Victoria Falls road, connecting Umguza District from Bulawayo Province side to Hwange District and Victoria Falls , a gateway to the neighbouring country Zambia. Other roads are yet to be tarred an indication of underdevelopment of the district. Tsholotsho District is connected by the road passing through Sipepa and Nkayi District on the other side is connected via Fitting road. Local people in the rural areas utilise donkey or ox driven cart as a mode of transport for crop produce or accessing service centres. A small aerodrome is available in the town area for mainly high profiled people and politicians or investors who come to visit the area for game activities or mineral surveys. Buildings Most buildings in Lupane notably Government Complex, Hospital and the Registry Offices were constructed after Lupane was declared provincial capital to serve the Province the Lupane State University rounds up a series of new complexes. The Town is fast expanding with Kusile Rural District Council and Lupane Local Board of new homesteads, low middle and high density suburbs, catering for low middle and high income people. Telecommunication Lupane has three mobile network communication receptions for Econet, Net*One and Telecel, and the TelOne offers landline connections. The reception in the Town area is very good, but this dwindles as remote areas are approached. The cost of using a cellphone is high for poor people in the area and many cannot afford, however, this has been a great opportunity for many who receive calls from diaspora friends and families who provide remittances back home. all networks offer data and provide data based messaging WhatsApp which is affordable by many albeit the higher cost of smartphones that one has to overcome.

Former Federal Board vice chair Blinder called it a \\"crackling read...a tour de force.\\" Buchholz's 2011 book Rush: Why You Thrive in the Rat Race was named a top ten book in the social sciences by Publishers Weekly, and a book of the year by the New York Post and Los Angeles Times.\\"Spring 2011 Adult Announcements\\", Publishers Weekly, Rush is a \\"synthesis of neuroeconomics and evolutionary psychology.\\" In 2012, Rush was featured on the Charlie Rose television show.Interview with Charlie Rose Buchholz's other works include New Ideas from Dead CEOs, Lasting Lessons from the Corner Office, From Here to Economy, Market Shock, and Bringing the Jobs Home. Buchholz resides primarily in San Diego, California and travels the world delivering keynote presentations on economics, finance, and innovation to such companies as Microsoft, IBM and General Electric, as well as to governmental organizations. He has lectured in the U.K. Parliament, as well as at the White House library and the U.S. Treasury. He is one of the founding producers of the Broadway musical Jersey Boys; is active in entrepreneurial businesses; holds engineering and design patents; and advises investment funds on business and portfolio strategy. In 2011, he co-founded software companySproglit, LLC. He is also the author of a mystery novel about a boxer and hedge funds, called The Castro Gene, which won a USA Best Books prize.The USA Best Books 2007 Awards, USA Book News Buchholz is the coauthor of the musical, Glory Ride, which tells the true story of Italians sneaking children out of Fascist Italy on bicycles. Glory Ride was performed in New York in January 2015, starring Tony Award nominee Josh Young, Alison Luff, and Quinn VanAntwerp. Economic Theories and Policy Proposals Buchholz has devised a number of economic theories and policy proposals, which have been presented in books, articles, and lectures: Law of Fertility, Prosperity, and Immigration In his book The Price of Prosperity, Buchholz shows that when a nation's annual average GDP rate exceeds 2.5 percent for two consecutive 25-year periods (two generations), the fertility rate will drop to just over the replacement level, that is, 2.5 children per female. If GDP continues to grow for a third consecutive generation, the fertility rate will tend to drop below 2.1 children per female and the population will require immigration to maintain a stable working population. As a corollary, if the fertility rate falls below the replacement rate, the nation will find it extraordinarily difficult to pay down accumulated debt. Locking in Super Low Rates On the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal in June 2012, Buchholz proposed that the U.S. Treasury lock in record low borrowing rates by issuing 100-year bonds. With the 10-year Treasury yielding just 1.62%, Buchholz called it the \\"best deal since Pope Julius paid a pittance to have Michelangelo paint his ceiling.\\" Fourteen months after the article appeared, yields had risen by 78 percent to 2.88%. Competition Breeds Cooperation In his book Rush, Buchholz argues through neuroscience and history that competitive societies achieve longer life expectancy, less disease, and greater measures of cooperation than societies that try to quash competitiveness.Todd G. Buchholz (2012) Rush: Why You Thrive in the Rat Race. New York: Hudson Street/Penguin. Turning Unemployment Compensation into Signing Bonuses In 2011, on the front page of the Washington Post Outlook section, Buchholz proposed turning unemployment compensation into signing bonuses. Instead of collecting 99 weeks of unemployment payments, under Buchholz's proposal, individuals would receive a signing bonus from the government if they accepted a job sooner. Crime and Interest Rates The Buchholz Hypothesis holds that crime is strongly correlated with interest rates.Todd G. Buchholz, (2007) New Ideas From Dead Economists. New York: Plume. p. 200 This hypothesis helps solve the puzzle of why crime fell during the Great Depression, even though conventional wisdom suggests that a bad economy leads people to commit more crime. Free-Rider Effect on National GDP In his book New Ideas from Dead Economists, Buchholz argues that small countries with large social welfare programs may achieve strong GDP gains because they are able to ride on the gains generated by countries that promote a more competitive structure with less governmental intervention. Sluggish World Growth Temporarily Benefits the U.S. Economy In a startling 2019 essay reprinted in the South China Morning Post and a variety of global publications, Buchholz explained that sluggish worldwide growth was, in fact, benefitting the U.S. economy. He pointed out that slow GDP growth among U.S. trading partners was keeping interest rates remarkably low and inflation well-contained, which is more important for the U.S. economy than the loss of export growth. This is a rare situation, he stated, that confounds the standard textbook explanations.https://www.project- syndicate.org/commentary/american-growth-global-slump-interest-rates-by-todd- g-buchholz-2019-06 Economic Forecasting In his media and speaking appearances, Buchholz frequently makes forecasts about major economic turns and developments, sometimes with surprising accuracy. Farmland Price Drop 2014‚Äì2015 In January 2014, in an essay entitled \\"Green Acres Turning Red,\\" Buchholz forecast a sharp decline in farmland prices, following a sharp multi- year rally. Buchholz stated that prices were \\"teetering on the slope of something ugly and parabolic.\\" Over the next two years, farmland rental rates dropped by almost 20 percent. Oil Price Collapse 2014‚Äì2015 In April 2014, with the price of oil at approximately $100 per barrel, Buchholz appeared on Fox Business Channel with Maria Bartiromo and forecast (correctly) that the price of oil would plunge to $50 per barrel. U.S. Debt Downgrade 2011 In 2011, in keynote speeches and in television and radio interviews, Buchholz forecast that the Standard and Poor's rating agency (S&P;) would downgrade U.S. Treasury debt. On August 5, S&P; announced the downgrade of U.S. debt from AAA to AA+ Economic Recovery Forecast 2009 In February 2009, Buchholz was among the first well-known U.S. economists to forecast an economic recovery from the \\"Great Recession.\\" In a speech to the Americas Lodging Investment Summit, Buchholz forecast that \\"we're going to have an economic recovery just in time for back-to-school sales in September\\" and that \\"lodging and hospitality is going to benefit from this upswing as well.\\" In fact, GDP did turn positive in the third quarter of 2009. April 2008 Commodities Forecast In April 2008, on the PBS Nightly Business Report, Buchholz forecast that commodity prices, including oil, would climb higher in the short-term but then tumble during the summer of 2008. On July 13, 2008, addressing the Southern Legislative Conference, when oil prices were $137 per barrel and leading Wall Street analysts were forecasting a move to $200, Buchholz predicted that prices would fall by half over the next six months. His comments were met with criticism from other leading economic analysts, but within the next eight weeks, prices of commodities such as oil, grain, and industrial metals started to crumble, and the price of oil fell significantly. June 2008 Economic Forecast In an opening keynote speech at Everything Channel's 2008 VARBusiness 300 Conference in June 2008, Buchholz said he believed that the U.S. economy, while undoubtedly in a slowdown, would avoid two consecutive quarters of negative GDP, the classic definition of a recession. \\"I'm convinced we're not going to have any quarters of negative GDP\\", he added. Buchholz cited high employment, lean inventories at manufacturers, and strong exports, spurred by the weaker dollar, as reasons for his beliefs. Commercial Failure of Airbus A380 In Buchholz‚Äôs book New Ideas from Dead CEOs, published in 2007 just before the first commercial launch of the Airbus A380, Buchholz criticized the project for inadequate testing of the engineering, commercial, and financial viability: ‚ÄúAirbus gathered orders for the behemoth A380 before the company knew how to build it.‚Äù Faced with inadequate orders and unsustainable operational costs, Airbus announced in 2019 that it would cease production. Instability of the Eurozone Buchholz's 1999 book Market Shock warned that the Eurozone was unstable and headed toward political turmoil.Todd G. Buchholz, (1999) Market Shock. New York: Harper Collins. p.146. In a chapter subtitled \\"How European Unity Splinters,\\" Buchholz pointed out that eventually the Mediterranean nations and Ireland would stumble because those countries required a different monetary policy than the core countries of Germany and France.

The channel mainly airs big band, swing, and hit parade music from 1936 to 1949, with occasional songs from the early-1950s. Until May 7, 2015, the station was known as '40s on 4, with programming being broadcast on channel 4, as part of the \\"Decades\\" line-up of stations. It was later rechanneled to be nearer to stations featuring similar genres of music, such as jazz and standards. During its first four months on Ch. 73, the station was known simply as '40s. The station was rebranded as 40s Junction on August 13, 2015. The 40s Junction name, and the station's longtime nickname, \\"The Savoy Express\\", refer to the passenger train‚àítravel common in the 1940s. The name also lends reference to the popular 1941 jazz song Chattanooga Choo Choo. The original \\"Station Master\\" (Program Director) for the channel was Marlin Taylor, with Bob Moke serving as Music Director. Both have since departed, and the channel is currently programmed by Human Newman. The \\"voice\\" of the channel is Lou Brutus, who models his announcing style after that of Bing Crosby staff announcer, Ken Carpenter. In keeping with the railroad theme, the station's logo now features a train itself. History Former logo as '40s on 4 before becoming 40s/40s Junction. XM once described the channel as follows: > Climb aboard the Savoy Express for a trip to yesterday and the sound of > swing. Revel in the heyday of the big bands and the hits of the '40s. All > aboard, Track 4! The current channel description reads: > Hep Cats and Swingeroos, here comes the Savoy Express. Crooners serenade, > and harmony groups join forces with orchestras to play everything in 'the > book'. From Benny Goodman and Bing Crosby, to Doris Day and Count Basie, > hear the hits from the '40s and beyond. Similar to other XM \\"Decades\\" stations, prior to the 2008 merger with Sirius, the '40s channel was initially programmed to recreate the feeling of the '40s era. This was accomplished by broadcasting big band/swing music; recreated newscasts in which fictional reporter \\"Ed Baxter\\", voiced by Bill Schmalfeldt, would report on the day's top stories in a year from 1936 to 1949, as if they were current now; countdowns of the top 3 hit songs from the current week in a year from 1936‚Äì1949; World War II‚Äìera, patriotic songs; Spike Jones's joke novelty recordings; along with such features as the Record Museum, which played tracks from any year between 1920 and 1935. During Academy Award season, director Bob Moke would regularly introduce and play all of the Academy-Award nominated songs for a particular year between 1936 and 1949. From November 16 through December 25, 2009, '40s on 4 would be preempted for Holiday Traditions, a seasonal program devoted to popular Christmas music from the 1940s to the 1960s. In 2010, the channel was again preempted for Holiday Traditions, this time starting November 15, and extending through January 1, 2011. On November 8, 2011, it was announcedhttps://twitter.com/40sOn4/status/134039987585941504 that Holiday Traditions would appear on its own channel (147), from November 14, 2011 to January 2, 2012. Previously featured programs included Harmony Square, a 1-hour presentation of barbershop music that aired on Sunday afternoons and evenings; Big Band Jump, a syndicated weekly program, hosted by Don Kennedy, that specialized in Big Band music and the stories behind it; and a weekly program devoted to vintage, Bing Crosby radio shows, such as Philco Radio Time and Kraft Music Hall. The channel was also used for XM's annual pop-music chronology, IT, from 2002 to 2007. From August 2011 to August 2013, Jonathan Schwartz, formerly of XM's High Standards and Siriusly Sinatra stations, was heard daily on '40s on 4, playing a mixture of classic and contemporary pop standards recordings. From March 26 to June 25, 2014, '40s on 4 was temporarily replaced by the Billy Joel Channel. This change was ill-received by many of the station's fans; many of whom cancelled their subscriptions or demanded refunds from Sirius XM as a result. Channel 4 was occupied by Pitbull's Globalization Radio when the '40s channel moved to Channel 73.\\"More changes at KRTH, big band station replaced with ‚ÄòPitbull‚Äôs Globalization‚Äô\\" from Los Angeles Daily News (August 31, 2015) While known as \\"40s\\", the station logo featured the previous logo, but the on 4 text was removed.

The district is now divided into sub-districts: Mberengwa North, East, West and South. It is bounded by Gwanda in Mberengwa west, and by Zvishavane in its northern zone, to the south it stretches to Neshuro, Chikombedzi and bounded by Manyuchi dam. Local government Mberengwa Rural District Council is the local authority over Mberengwa District. The district comprises 4 parliamentary constituencies with a total of 37 councillors overseeing the same number of wards. the wards are distributed as follows; * Mberengwa-East Constituency has 7 wards 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 20. * Mberengwa-West Constituency has 8 wards; 13, 14, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33 and 34. * Mberengwa-North Constituency has 12 wards; 1, 2, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 35, 36 and 37. * Mberengwa-South Constituency has 10 wards; 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28. Background The name \\"Mberengwa\\" itself comes from the Karanga phrase Mbere-yeingwa. The other plausible theory about the meaning of Mberengwa is 'verengwa' which is an act of census believed to have been conducted by the Lemba people stationed at Mount Mberengwa after a terrible plague. Clans that had been counted and accounted for became Mberengwa. After the census various clans of the Lemba migrated to different parts of the district including Thohoyandou in Venda, South Africa. This name is still used as a clan name by the Hadji tribe of the Lemba (Mzezewas) still stationed near the mountain. The Hadji clan in South Africa also uses Mbelengwa (with an 'L'from their local Venda language) to describe themselves. Mount Mberengwa is one of the highest mountains in Zimbabwe, but not as high as the mountains in the Eastern Highlands. Pre-Independence in 1980, the mountain and district was also called Belingwe which was a colonial adulteration of Mberengwa. The indigenous languages spoken in Mberengwa are mainly Karanga and Ndebele. Pfumbi, a variation of Karanga which is also close to Kalanga, has also been spoken in chief Muketi areas. The Pfumbi quickly assimilated into the Karanga and most of them crossed Mwenezi river and settled in the Maranda and Shayamavhudzi areas in southern Masvingo. It is thought that Pfumbi used to be more widespread than this in the past before the onset of Shona as the compulsory vernacular language to be taught in schools. One name which retains a trace of that past up to now is Mupandashango school, which in the Shona form of today would be Mupandasango. It is possible to meet people called Mashango (Masango) The use of words with velar fricatives, once represented by the letter \\"x\\", but now abandoned by orthography since the 1956 Samukange-led standardization of Shona, is another example that clearly and closely links the Karanga of Mberengwa with Kalanga with which it used to relate in places west of the current district as well as in the Gwanda West Nicholson area where the Jaunda version of Kalanga used to abound, and in Mwenezi. These are words like \\"xwera, xare, xwitaidza\\". Many areas of Zvishavane share a lot in common with the Karanga language spoken in Mberengwa. Generally, Shona can be considered to be foreign to the Mberengwa area. Many Ndebele speakers were settled in the Mberengwa district throughout the 1900s, on their own accord or because of colonial government relocations meant to pave way for White farms and mines in their areas of original settlement such as the De Beers ranch and other places in the Somabula and Shangani areas. Because of these new arrivals, Ndebele words are used freely in Mberengwa's Karanga, which is a natural process of borrowing and adaptation among closely settled and interacting peoples. In Mashonaland where immigrant workers of Malawian origin were found in numbers, Zezuru (Shona) borrowed and adapted words like \\"tsano, kabanga, wondonga\\" etc. n.b. A lot of words were brought in from Karanga, Shona, Manyika and utilized there. Examples are \\"dhuku (doek), bhurukwa (broek), jon'hosi (from Afrikaans for [young ox])\\" and others. As in Kalanga, the use of \\"l\\" in words like \\"dla\\" or \\"tla\\" (to eat, to fear) is part of the Karanga language and not a borrowing from Ndebele language. The other tribe that forms the great party of Mberengwa is the Shoko clan. It has four families that share the mapiravana chieftainship namely Wadawareva, manonose, Sukira and Makonese. The current chief is called Rungano. Operations The district is prone to droughts and high temperatures, but abundant in minerals like gold, iron ore, emeralds and asbestos. Buchwa Mine, Vanguard Mine, Sandawana and C Mine are all in Mberengwa. It is known for its riches in minerals and fauna. Gold is mined at C Mine and other small claims mines scattered around Mberengwa. Emeralds are mined at Sandawana while Vanguard Mine was once a major player in asbestos production till the 1980s when asbestos lost its importance to the world. Chrome was mined at Rhonda and Inyala mines, but these closed down due to the disastrous effects of the Zimbabwean crisis and Zimbabwe's liberation struggle. Cattle ranching is a major farming activity. Mataga growth point, is the centre which provides goods and services to the rural population of mberengwa. Mataga growth point is where the creation of balanced socio- economic developments of Mataga occurs. Most micro-level planning for Mberengwa occurs here. Education The district has a number of missionary- run schools that run up to A-Level, notably Chegato and Musume, Masase and Mnene. After 1980, the government constructed a number of rural day secondary schools also known as \\"Upper Tops\\" among them Guruva, Chovuragu, Bubwe, Zvamagwiro, Mabika, Maringambizi, Mbuya Nehanda, Bayayi, Murerezi, Chegute, Svita, Chizungu, Madenyika, Sviba, Makuva, Funye, Vuronga, Mposi, Ruzengwe, Chingoma, Vutsanana, Zvomukonde, Chemimwe, Vutika, Rengwe and Chomusenda. They have helped improve the education standards as well as creating education opportunities for many rural children. There are missionary-run hospitals and clinics. Most of the schools and hospitals are run by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Zimbabwe. Non-governmental organizations like CARE have or had had programs operating there as well. Sports Primary and secondary schools in Mberengwa compete yearly in football tournaments. There is a trophy won, originally funded by the Coca-Cola Company. Soccer is the most favored sport in the district. Apart from soccer, gollball is also a popular sport for visually impaired school children. Over the years basketball has gained momentum especially amongst high schools. Mission schools under the Evangelical Lutheran Church compete in the E L C Z sports tournament which are held yearly. They are rotated amongst the schools. Sporting activities such as soccer, netball, basketball, volleyball, etc. are competed. One year focuses on track events then the next year focuses on field events.

This practice occurs in a variety of industries such as mining and mineral processing, agriculture, pharmaceutical, food, plastics, and recycling. A method of separating solid particles according to size alone is called screening. General categories Screening falls under two general categories: dry screening, and wet screening. From these categories, screening separates a flow of material into grades, these grades are then either further processed to an intermediary product or a finished product. Additionally, the machines can be categorized into a moving screen and static screen machines, as well as by whether the screens are horizontal or inclined. Applications The mining and mineral processing industry uses screening for a variety of processing applications. For example, after mining the minerals, the material is transported to a primary crusher. Before crushing large boulder are scalped on a shaker with thick shielding screening. Further down stream after crushing the material can pass through screens with openings or slots that continue to become smaller. Finally, screening is used to make a final separation to produce saleable products based on a grade or a size range. Process Model of Screening Process A screening machine consist of a drive that induces vibration, a screen media that causes particle separation, and a deck which holds the screen media and the drive and is the mode of transport for the vibration. There are physical factors that makes screening practical. For example, vibration, g force, bed density, and material shape all facilitate the rate or cut. Electrostatic forces can also hinder screening efficiency in way of water attraction causing sticking or plugging, or very dry material generate a charge that causes it to attract to the screen itself. As with any industrial process there is a group of terms that identify and define what screening is. Terms like blinding, contamination, frequency, amplitude, and others describe the basic characteristics of screening, and those characteristics in turn shape the overall method of dry or wet screening. In addition, the way a deck is vibrated differentiates screens. Different types of motion have their advantages and disadvantages. In addition media types also have their different properties that lead to advantages and disadvantages. Finally, there are issues and problems associated with screening. Screen tearing, contamination, blinding, and dampening all affect screening efficiency. Physical principles *Vibration - either sinusoidal vibration or gyratory vibration. **Sinusoidal Vibration occurs at an angled plane relative to the horizontal. The vibration is in a wave pattern determined by frequency and amplitude. **Gyratory Vibration occurs at near level plane at low angles in a reciprocating side to side motion. *Gravity - This physical interaction is after material is thrown from the screen causing it to fall to a lower level. Gravity also pulls the particles through the screen media. *Density - The density of the material relates to material stratification. *Electrostatic Force - This force applies to screening when particles are extremely dry or is wet. Screening terminology Like any mechanical and physical entity there are scientific, industrial, and layman terminology. The following is a partial list of terms that are associated with mechanical screening. *Amplitude - This is a measurement of the screen cloth as it vertically peaks to its tallest height and troughs to its lowest point. Measured in multiples of the acceleration constant g (g-force). *Acceleration - Applied Acceleration to the screen mesh in order to overcome the van der waal forces *Blinding - When material plugs into the open slots of the screen cloth and inhibits overflowing material from falling through.Woven Wire Mesh Glossary of Terms *Brushing - This procedure is performed by an operator who uses a brush to brush over the screen cloth to dislodged blinded opening. *Contamination - This is unwanted material in a given grade. This occurs when there is oversize or fine size material relative to the cut or grade. Another type of contamination is foreign body contamination. **Oversize contamination occurs when there is a hole in the screen such that the hole is larger than the mesh size of the screen. Other instances where oversize occurs is material overflow falling into the grade from overhead, or there is the wrong mesh size screen in place. **Fines contamination is when large sections of the screen cloth is blinded over, and material flowing over the screen does not fall through. The fines are then retained in the grade. **Foreign body contamination is unwanted material that differs from the virgin material going over and through the screen. It can be anything ranging from tree twigs, grass, metal slag to other mineral types and composition. This contamination occurs when there is a hole in the scalping screen or a foreign material's mineralogy or chemical composition differs from the virgin material. *Deck - a deck is frame or apparatus that holds the screen cloth in place. It also contains the screening drive. It can contain multiple sections as the material travels from the feed end to the discharge end. Multiple decks are screen decks placed in a configuration where there are a series of decks attached vertically and lean at the same angle as it preceding and exceeding decks. Multiple decks are often referred to as single deck, double deck, triple deck, etc. *Frequency - Measured in hertz (Hz) or revolutions per minute (RPM). Frequency is the number of times the screen cloth sinusoidally peaks and troughs within a second. As for a gyratory screening motion it is the number of revolutions the screens or screen deck takes in a time interval, such as revolution per minute (RPM). *Gradation, grading - Also called \\"cut\\" or \\"cutting.\\" Given a feed material in an initial state, the material can be defined to have a particle size distribution. Grading is removing the maximum size material and minimum size material by way of mesh selection.Soil Gradation *Screen Media (Screen cloth) - it is the material defined by mesh size, which can be made of any type of material such steel, stainless steel, rubber compounds, polyurethane, brass, etc.Pit & Quarry - Lesson 7 ‚Äì Screening *Shaker - the whole assembly of any type mechanical screening machine. *Stratification - This phenomenon occurs as vibration is passed through a bed of material. This causes coarse (larger) material to rise and finer (smaller) material to descend within the bed. The material in contact with screen cloth either falls through a slot or blinds the slot or contacts the cloth material and is thrown from the cloth to fall to the next lower level. *Mesh - The number of open slots per linear inch. Mesh is arranged in multiple configuration. Mesh can be a square pattern, long-slotted rectangular pattern, circular pattern, or diamond pattern.The Complete Wire Mesh Glossary of Terms *Scalp, scalping - this is the very first cut of the incoming material with the sum of all its grades. Scalping is removing the largest size particles. This includes enormously large particles relative to the other particle's sizes. Scalping also cleans the incoming material from foreign body contamination such as twigs, trash, glass, or other unwanted oversize material. Types of mechanical screening There are a number of types of mechanical screening equipment that cause segregation. These types are based on the motion of the machine through its motor drive. *Circle-throw vibrating equipment - This type of equipment has an eccentric shaft that causes the frame of the shaker to lurch at a given angle. This lurching action literally throws the material forward and up. As the machine returns to its base state the material falls by gravity to physically lower level. This type of screening is used also in mining operations for large material with sizes that range from six inches to +20 mesh.WS Tyler ¬ª F-Class *High frequency vibrating equipment - This type of equipment drives the screen cloth only. Unlike above the frame of the equipment is fixed and only the screen vibrates. However, this equipment is similar to the above such that it still throws material off of it and allows the particles to cascade down the screen cloth. These screens are for sizes smaller than 1/8 of an inch to +150 mesh.RHEWUM WA- The original *Gyratory equipment - This type of equipment differs from the above two such that the machine gyrates in a circular motion at a near level plane at low angles. The drive is an eccentric gear box or eccentric weights.Engelsmann Separators and ScreenersSweco - Vibratory Screener, Sifters Russell Finex Industrial Screening and Filtration equipment Manufacturer Chemical Tumbler Screener *Trommel screens - Does not require vibrations, instead, material is fed into a horizontal rotating drum with screen panels around the diameter of the drum. Tumbler screening technique An improvement on vibration, vibratory, and linear screeners, a tumbler screener uses elliptical action which aids in screening of even very fine material. As like panning for gold, the fine particles tend to stay towards the center and the larger go to the outside. It allows for segregation and unloads the screen surface so that it can effectively do its job. With the addition of multiple decks and ball cleaning decks, even difficult products can be screened at high capacity to very fine separations. Circle-throw vibrating equipment Circle-Throw Vibrating Equipment is a shaker or a series of shakers as to where the drive causes the whole structure to move. The structure extends to a maximum throw or length and then contracts to a base state. A pattern of springs are situated below the structure to where there is vibration and shock absorption as the structure returns to the base state. This type of equipment is used for very large particles, sizes that range from pebble size on up to boulder size material. It is also designed for high volume output. As a scalper, this shaker will allow oversize material to pass over and fall into a crusher such a cone crusher, jaw crusher, or hammer mill. The material that passes the screen by-passes the crusher and is conveyed and combined with the crush material. Also this equipment is used in washing processes, as material passes under spray bars, finer material and foreign material is washed through the screen. This is one example of wet screening. High frequency vibrating equipment High Energy Screening Machine High frequency vibrating equipment is a shaker whose frame is fixed and the drive vibrates only the screen cloth . High frequency vibration equipment is for particles that are in this particle size range of an 1/8 in (3 mm) down to a +150 mesh. These shakers usually make a secondary cut for further processing or make a finished product cut. These shakers are usually set at a steep angle relative to the horizontal level plane. Angles range from 25 to 45 degrees relative to the horizontal level plane. Gyratory Screener Gyratory equipment This type of equipment has an eccentric drive or weights that causes the shaker to travel in an orbital path. The material rolls over the screen and falls with the induction of gravity and directional shifts. Rubber balls and trays provide an additional mechanical means to cause the material to fall through. The balls also provide a throwing action for the material to find an open slot to fall through. The shaker is set a shallow angle relative to the horizontal level plane. Usually, no more than 2 to 5 degrees relative to the horizontal level plane. These types of shakers are used for very clean cuts. Generally, a final material cut will not contain any oversize or any fines contamination. These shakers are designed for the highest attainable quality at the cost of a reduced feed rate. Trommel screens Trommel screens have a rotating drum on a shallow angle with screen panels around the diameter of the drum. The feed material always sits at the bottom of the drum and, as the drum rotates, always comes into contact with clean screen. The oversize travels to the end of the drum as it does not pass through the screen, while the undersize passes through the screen into a launder below. Screen Media Attachment Systems There are many ways to install screen media into a screen box deck (shaker deck). Also, the type of attachment system has an influence on the dimensions of the media. Tensioned screen media Tensioned screen cloth is typically 4 feet by the width or the length of the screening machine depending on whether the deck is side or end tensioned. Screen cloth for tensioned decks can be made with hooks and are attached with clamp rails bolted on both sides of the screen box. When the clamp rail bolts are tightened, the cloth is tensioned or even stretched in the case of some types of self-cleaning screen media. To ensure that the center of the cloth does not tap repeatedly on the deck due to the vibrating shaker and that the cloth stays tensioned, support bars are positioned at different heights on the deck to create a crown curve from hook to hook on the cloth.Crown curve Tensioned screen cloth is available in various materials: stainless steel, high carbon steel and oil tempered steel wires, as well as moulded rubber or polyurethane and hybrid screens (a self-cleaning screen cloth made of rubber or polyurethane and metal wires). Commonly, vibratory-type screening equipment employs rigid, circular sieve frames to which woven wire mesh is attached. Conventional methods of producing tensioned meshed screens has given way in recent years to bonding, whereby the mesh is no longer tensioned and trapped between a sieve frame body and clamping ring; instead, developments in modern adhesive technologies has allowed the industry to adopt high strength structural adhesives to bond tensioned mesh directly to frames. Modular screen media Modular screen media is typically 1 foot large by 1 or 2 feet long Panels Dimensions (4 feet long for ISEPREN WS 85 ISEPREN WS 85 brochure) steel reinforced polyurethane or rubber panels. They are installed on a flat deck (no crown) that normally has a larger surface than a tensioned deck. This larger surface design compensates for the fact that rubber and polyurethane modular screen media offers less open area than wire cloth. Over the years, numerous ways have been developed to attach modular panels to the screen deck stringers (girders).Modular panels types Some of these attachment systems have been or are currently patented.Google Patent - vibrating screen panel Self-cleaning screen media is also available on this modular system.Flex-Mat 3 Modular Types of Screen Media There are several types of screen media manufactured with different types of material that use the two common types of screen media attachment systems, tensioned and modular. Woven Wire Cloth (Mesh) Woven wire cloth, typically produced from stainless steel, is commonly employed as a filtration medium for sieving in a wide range of industries. Most often woven with a plain weave, or a twill weave for the lightest of meshes, apertures can be produced from a few microns upwards (e.g. 25 microns), employing wires with diameters from as little as 25 microns. A twill weave allows a mesh to be woven when the wire diameter is too thick in proportion to the aperture. Other, less commonplace, weaves, such as Dutch/Hollander, allow the production of meshes that are stronger and/or having smaller apertures. Today wire cloth is woven to strict international standards, e.g. ISO1944:1999, which dictates acceptable tolerance regarding nominal mesh count and blemishes. The nominal mesh count, to which mesh is generally defined is a measure of the number of openings per lineal inch, determined by counting the number of openings from the centre of one wire to the centre of another wire one lineal inch away. For example, a 2 mesh woven with a wire of 1.6mm wire diameter has an aperture of 11.1mm (see picture below of a 2 mesh with an intermediate crimp). The formula for calculating the aperture of a mesh, with a known mesh count and wire diameter, is as follows: a = \\\\left ( \\\\frac{25.4}{b} \\\\right ) - c where a = aperture, b = mesh count and c = wire diameter. 2 mesh with an intermediate crimp Other calculations regarding woven wire cloth/mesh can be made including weight and open area determination. Of note, wire diameters are often referred to by their standard wire gauge (swg); e.g. a 1.6mm wire is a 16 swg. Traditionally, screen cloth was made with metal wires woven with a loom.Haver & Boeker history 19th century‚Äôs product book page 1 from Major Wire19th century‚Äôs product book page 2 from Major Wire Today, woven cloth is still widely used primarily because they are less expensive than other types of screen media. Over the years, different weaving techniques have been developed; either to increase the open area percentage or add wear-life. Slotted opening woven clothPhoto of a slotted opening woven wire cloth is used where product shape is not a priority and where users need a higher open area percentage. Flat-top woven clothWeave Types (see type E for Flat Top) is used when the consumer wants to increase wear-life. On regular woven wire, the crimps (knuckles on woven wires) wear out faster than the rest of the cloth resulting in premature breakage. On flat-top woven wire, the cloth wears out equally until half of the wire diameter is worn, resulting in a longer wear life. Unfortunately flat-top woven wire cloth is not widely used because of the lack of crimps that causes a pronounced reduction of passing fines resulting in premature wear of con crushers. Perforated & Punch Plate On a crushing and screening plant, punch plates or perforated platesPerforated Plate & Punch Plate are mostly used on scalper vibrating screens, after raw products pass on grizzly bars.Grizzly Screen Most likely installed on a tensioned deck, punch plates offer excellent wear life for high-impact and high material flow applications. Synthetic screen media (typically rubber or polyurethane) Synthetic screen media is used where wear life is an issue. Large producers such as mines or huge quarries use them to reduce the frequency of having to stop the plant for screen deck maintenance. Rubber is also used as a very resistant high-impact screen media material used on the top deck of a scalper screen.Photo of a scalper screen with tensioned rubber panels To compete with rubber screen media fabrication, polyurethane manufacturers developed screen media with lower Shore Hardness. To compete with self-cleaning screen media that is still primarily available in tensioned cloth, synthetic screen media manufacturers also developed membrane screen panels, slotted opening panels and diamond opening panels. Due to the 7-degree demoulding angle, polyurethane screen media users can experience granulometry changes of product during the wear life of the panel.‚Äú7-degree demolding angle results in its openings widening as soon as the top surface is worn‚Äù Self- Cleaning Screen Media Self-cleaning screen media was initially engineered to resolve screen cloth blinding, clogging and pegging problems. The idea was to place crimped wires side by side on a flat surface, creating openings and then, in some way, holding them together over the support bars (crown bars or bucker bars). This would allow the wires to be free to vibrate between the support bars, preventing blinding, clogging and pegging of the cloth. Initially, crimped longitudinal wires on self-cleaning cloth were held together over support bars with woven wire.‚ÄúSelf-Cleaning‚Äù woven wire cloth In the 50s, some manufacturers started to cover the woven cross wires with caulking or rubber to prevent premature wear of the crimps (knuckles on woven wires). One of the pioneer products in this category was ONDAP GOMME made by the French manufacturer Giron.Giron‚Äôs Anti-clogging products During the mid 90s, Major Wire Industries Ltd., a Quebec manufacturer, developed a ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù self-cleaning screen cloth called Flex-Mat, without woven cross wires.Flex-Mat 15th anniversary In this product, the crimped longitudinal wires are held in place by polyurethane strips. Instead of locking (impeding) the vibration over the support bars with woven cross wires, the polyurethane strips lessens the vibration of the longitudinal wires over the support bars but does not stop it, consequently allowing vibration from hook to hook.Hook to hook vibration Major Wire quickly started to promote this product as a high-performance screen that helped producers screen more in-specification material for less cost and not simply a problem solver.\\"Flex-Mat¬Æ 3 Increases Throughput While Reducing Downtime\\" They claimed that the independent vibrating wires helped produce more product compared to a woven wire cloth with the same opening (aperture) and wire diameter. This higher throughput would be a direct result of the higher vibration frequency of each independent wire of the screen cloth (calculated in hertz) compared to the shaker vibration (calculated in RPM), accelerating the stratification of the material bed. Another benefit that helped the throughput increase is that hybrid self-cleaning screen media offered a better open area percentage than woven wire screen media. Due to its flat surface (no knuckles), hybrid self-cleaning screen media can use a smaller wire diameter for the same aperture than woven wire and still lasts as long, resulting in a greater opening percentage.

Although popularly known to the press as the \\"Kissing Bandit\\" for kissing a male robbery victim, she was known in the underworld as \\"Rabbit\\" for her skills in breaking out of the penitentiary. She was married to two criminals in the 1920s, but is best known as the lover and crime partner of Volney Davis. Life Born Martha Edna Stanley, she was the daughter of Nicholas and Luella Stanley in Marion, Kansas.Hoover, J. Edgar, \\"The Kidnapping of Edward Bremer\\", November 19, 1936 She moved with her father to Oklahoma at an early age. As a teenager, she married a man named Paden with whom, in 1917, she had a son, Preston.Barker- Karpis gang, Memorandum, July 12, 1937 She and Paden soon separated. She married again to Walter Price, but that marriage also failed. Crime career Murray was working as a waitress when she met robber Volney Davis, who became her lover. He was imprisoned for life in 1918. She moved to Kansas City, Missouri where she joined her younger sister Doris, who was living with criminal Emory Connell. Murray met and married Connell's partner, jewel thief \\"Diamond Joe\\" Sullivan. Sullivan was convicted of murder in 1924 and was executed. After Sullivan's death, she met and married another criminal, Jack Murray. On October 1, 1925 Edna and Murray were sentenced to 25 years for a Kansas City, Missouri holdup. It was this crime that earned Edna the nickname \\"the Kissing Bandit\\", after she supposedly kissed victim H. H. Southward. On May 2, 1927, Edna escaped from Missouri State Penitentiary and remained free until arrested in Chicago on September 10, 1931. She made a one-day escape from prison on November 4, 1931, and then a third escape on December 13, 1932, having sawn through the bars of her cell, assisted by another prisoner, Irene McCann, who escaped with her.FBI Barker-Karpis summary, page 13 Edna joined up with Volney Davis again, who had also absconded from prison in 1932. The two continued their crime spree and later settled down in Aurora, Illinois. Her son Preston joined them, and participated in their crimes. The couple soon joined up with the Barker-Karpis gang. Edna's sister Doris was now living with outlaw Jess Doyle, also a member of the Barker-Karpis gang. On April 23, 1934, outlaws John Dillinger, Homer Van Meter and John \\"Red\\" Hamilton arrived at Murray's home seeking refuge after being ambushed by federal agents and police at their hideout near Rhinelander, Wisconsin. Hamilton, having been badly wounded during the shootout, had been denied treatment by Chicago mob doctor Joseph Moran and died of his injuries several days after arriving at their Aurora home. Murray and Davis were later present during his secret funeral, in which he was buried in an unmarked grave. On January 22, 1935, Murray was indicted along with several members of the Barker gang for a conspiracy to kidnap wealthy Minnesota banker Edward Bremer and ransom him for $200,000 in January 1934. Fleeing the state, she was apprehended in Pittsburg, Kansas while traveling with Jess Doyle on February 7, 1935. Murray's brother, Harry C. Stanley, was subsequently arrested for aiding and abetting Murray in early 1935, was fined $1,000 and sentenced to six months imprisonment at the Sedgewick County Jail on March 12, 1935. The following year, her son Preston Leroy Paden was convicted of murder for killing a night watchman in Kansas. He was given a life sentence.Robert Barr Smith, The Outlaws: Tales of Bad Guys Who Shaped the Wild West, Globe Pequot, 2013, p,127. Murray was not found guilty in the kidnapping conspiracy but was returned to the Women's prison in Jefferson City, Mo to finish serving her term for highway robbery. Volney Davis led FBI agents to Hamilton's grave outside Aurora, Illinois three months later. Edna eventually backed his story up. Later life Murray was very cooperative with the authorities after her capture and gave evidence against a number of the Barker-Karpis gang's associates, along with corrupt police officers and lawyers. While in prison, she marketed her persona as a \\"gangster's moll\\" in a number of newspapers and journals, writing articles with titles such as \\"I Was a Karpis-Barker Gang Moll\\".Murray, E, \\"I Was a Karpis-Barker Gang Moll\\", Startling Detective Adventures, Oct, 1936 She was paroled from the Women's Prison at Jefferson City, Missouri on December 20, 1940.

Canadian artists who released Raw Energy albums included King Apparatus, King Cobb Steelie, Dinner Is Ruined, Random Killing, Trunk, Marilyn's Vitamins, Five Knuckle Chuckle, Three Impotent Males, Out of Hand, Cut Off, Double Standard, and Sectorseven. Raw Energy also released product from two U.S. acts, The Toasters and Rosie O'Shea. Grouped into the alternative genre, augmenting its roster of punk and ska, the label released a rap album from Top Secret and a noise album from Space City USA. Compilation albums In 1993, Raw Energy released its first compilation, simply titled Raw Energy. Because of the cartoon drawing used on the cover, it quickly took on the name On the Road within the hardcore community. Raw Energy played on this to release a series of \\"On the Road\\" compilations, featuring unsigned and emerging Canadian punk, hardcore and alternative rock bands du jour. Some would end up signing with Raw Energy. The series of \\"On the Road\\" compilations includes: * Raw Energy (aka On the Road, 1993) * On the Road Again (1994) * Dead on the Road: Songs Without Keyboards (1994) * On the Road to New York City (1994) * On the Road to Amsterdam (1999) * On the Road... with a Snowboard (1999) Other compilations include Twentybandcomp, co-released with Shock Records in Australia.

Situated on Zimbabwe's Great Dyke mountain range, about 100 kilometers north of the capital, Harare.http://www.mbendi.com/indy/ming/chrm/af/zi/p0005.htm The mines at Mutorashanga are largely owned by Zimasco, a chrome mining company owned in turn by Sinosteel Corporation, although some are operated by contractors. The area is well known for its abundant aloes, now threatened by mining, and other endemic flora. Aloe Ortholopha is endemic to the section of the Great Dyke mountain range in the Mutorashanga area. Zimasco operates ferrochrome mines in Shurugwi and Lalapanzi in Zimbabwe's Midlands Province. It also operates Zimbabwe's largest ferrochrome smelter in the Midlands town of Kwekwe. Muriel Gold Mine, south of Mutorashanga, also forms part of the sub-district. Mutorashanga falls under the administration of Lomagundi District in Mashonaland West Province and sits on the border of Mashonaland Central Province. The \\"town\\" consists of the mines, a police station, a post office, a Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority Office and small trading stores. Mutorashanga has no urban status. The town sits on the Lone Cow Farm and on Umvukwes Ranch and its extensions. Until 2000, when large-scale farmers were displaced, the area was a tobacco-growing district. Farmers also grew corn (maize), soy and winter wheat. Ethel mine (Coordinates: ) 10 km north of Mutorashanga is a flooded Asbestos quarry. The mine is used by diving clubs and swimmers (the water is very clear, and there are several 'wrecks' at the bottom). There was a Mutorashanga Triathlon held here for a few years (~2000). The quarry is known as the \\"Green Pool.\\" Water in the Green Pool is algae-free because of intense mineral content and it is unsuitable for agriculture. Water running in streams, mainly seasonal, off the Great Dyke is potable but not used for agriculture until it has passed through a granite range that runs adjacent to the Dyke. The chrome and salt content of the water keep the water clear, a rare occurrence in Zimbabwe outside of the Eastern Highlands. Chrome Fines, a black, shiny powder-like substance, lies freely on the ground in many parts of the town, particularly after it has rained. Few plants grow well on the mineralised soils of Mutorashanga, making it unsuitable for agriculture or grazing. Waterberry trees and phoenix palms are indigenous and grow on stream banks. Ferrochrome mining in Mutorashanga began commercially in 1921 with the Rhodesian Chrome Corp. Ltd. Ownership has changed hands several times and has included, but not been limited to, Union Carbide. The name derives from the Shona language spoken by 80 percent of Zimbabweans. Mutora - you take or carry, shanga - maize (corn) stalks. Residents say the name was incorrectly written by white administrators and that shanga should be shangu, or shoes, a reference to the stony ground that characterizes the area. Most residents of the town are mineworkers and their families who live in a series of company- owned villages from Kutanga Village in the south to Ethel Village in the north. A single tarred road, owned by the mining companies in the area, runs through the town and all other roads are gravel. The mine road runs from Mapinga on the Harare-Chirundi Highway to the turn-off to the Victory Block, a former large-scale farming area developed after the end of World War II. The tar road makes it easier for miners to move ferrochrome ore to the Kildonan Railway Siding south of Mutorashanga. Mutorashanga has several primary and one secondary school. A small hospital, owned by Zimasco, provides limited health care and maternity services.

Located 192 km south of Harare along the Harare - Masvingo highway. Approx 100 km from Masvingo. Background The main employer was the Athens Mine (formerly the Falcon Mine) owned by Lonrho Zimbabwe which mined gold, silver, and copper. It was closed down around 1996 due to a mine shaft collapse and the low price of gold. One may still see a huge chimney, on top of a hill near the mine, built in 1913 and visible from miles away. The chimney is 40.28m tall. A Scotsman by the name of Blackie, the maternal grandfather of virologist Professor Robert 'Bob' Swanepoel, apparently played a major role in building this chimney.Pers. comm. Population The population is estimated to be around 7000, and the town has an altitude of 1406m.http://www.tiptopglobe.com/city?n=Mvuma&p;=6498 Geology The Athens and Falcon gold-copper mines are just south of Mvuma, within the east-west trending Umvuma greenstone belt, consisting of talcose, tremolitic, and chloritic schists. Claims were filed at Falcon in 1900, and mining of chalcopyrite, with a gold content of 6.7 gram per ton, took place from 1910 until 1926. The Athens, 500 m to the east, was mined from 1923 until 1958 for gold and silver within pyrite, pyrrhotite, and chalcopyrite. Lonrho Investment Co. operated the claims starting in 1973. Geography The area is link between Gweru and Chivhu. Located approximately 83 km from Gweru and approximately 54 km to Chivhu. The area is surrounded by Chirumhanzu Communal lands which fall within its administration. Nearby farms include the former Central Estates Headquarters formerly owned by N. Van Hoogstraten with capacity to employee 1000 workers. Due to land redistribution in 2000 the agricultural hub failed, with the closure of Athens mine, led to migration and thus urban decay of Mvuma.http://www.sundaymail.co.zw/?p=19837 Operations There are huge cyanide dumps around the town as a by-product from the gold mining. Now dominated by cattle ranching and agriculture as the means of community support. Formally known as Umvuma, and Umvooma. Mvuma houses a few government offices at district level. It hosts the Chirumhanzu Rural District Council offices as well as a district hospital. Economy In 2010 business started booming in Mvuma, taking advantage of highway users. Chicken Slice, a fast food outlet and Unique Rama, a truckstop and restaurant, were opened.

Pre-1950 Ngundu Halt was a stopping point for the Rhodesia Railways Road Motor Service, or RMS. There was a small roof topped structure with a secure door where the mailbag was dropped for Triangle Estates and for other residents in the Lowveld. The road was tar strips on the Fort Victoria (now Masvingo) - Beit Bridge road, and dirt from the halt to Triangle. Local bus services stopped there and small traders selling corn on the cob and other travel- related foods did a brisk trade when the buses stopped. Rufus Paul noted that it was a point at which there was a need for a filling station and a country store. He applied to the Native Commissioner for a permit to build both and homes for himself and his staff, the NC allowed this, and for a small annual rent, GBP4.00, a four-acre plot was allocated and Paul's Ngundu Store was born. This was about 1948. There was a drought in 1950. Many villagers were unable to reap for their household use, and they borrowed a bag of maize (corn) at a time as required. All bar one (who had a good reason) paid their loans back, something that impressed the Pauls immensely. A bond had been created with the locals. The store was nestled amongst magnificent m'sasa tree covered kopjies, and behind it was a huge drop into the lower country below. One could sit on a rock and observe the activities of the local folk as they went about their activities. There were many beautiful exotic flowering trees and flowers planted. Rufus Paul was a Seventh-Day Adventist and the store was closed sunset Friday to sunset Saturday. Motorists who were short of fuel were given, free of charge, enough fuel to move on to the next filling station. Churches and schools run by the church were built with the aid of Rufus Paul. The store had a small clinic and a vehicle was on standby to ferry emergencies either to Lundi Mission, Chibi Clinic or Morgenster Mission, depending on their severity. The store was sold in about 1970 to Norman Richards who subsequently sold it. The writer has not any knowledge of the current owner.

He was playing the violin at the age of three, but soon developed an interest in the piano, which he studied in Warsaw with Aleksander Micha≈Çowski before making his debut in Antwerp in 1906. In New York, his father brought him to the attention of Walter Damrosch, who obtained a scholarship for him at the Institute of Musical Art (now the Juilliard School) as a pupil of Zygmunt Stojowski, with whom he studied from 1907 to 1911. In 1913 Levitzki entered the Berlin Hochschule f√ºr Musik, where he became the youngest student of Ernst von Dohn√°nyi and was awarded the Mendelssohn Prize in 1915. By this time he had performed throughout Europe and Scandinavia. He made his American debut in New York on October 17, 1916, at Aeolian Hall, and soon made his permanent home in the United States, later becoming an American citizen. Levitzki concertized worldwide up until the time of his death. He toured in the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Asia, making a reputation with his performances of the Romantic repertory. He was elected an honorary member of the Alpha chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia fraternity at the New England Conservatory in 1917. He transcribed numerous pieces for piano, prepared a cadenza for Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto, and wrote small pieces for the piano. Among his most popular compositions for piano were The Enchanted Nymph, Valse in A, Valse tzigane, and a gavotte. He also recorded extensively for the AMPICO Piano Roll Company during the 1920s.

Paleontologists have disagreed on its relationship to other mammals, in part because quite different animals were assigned to the genus, making Cimolestes a grade taxon of animals with similar features rather than a genus of closely related ones. Fossils have been found in North America, where they first appeared during the Late Cretaceous. According to some paleontologists, they died out at the start of the Paleocene, while others report the genus from the early Eocene. Most species have been described from teeth and isolated fragments. One complete articulated skeleton provisionally assigned to Cimolestes has been found. It shows a small, agile, tree-dwelling predator with long toes for grasping branches and a prehensile tail at least twice the length of its body. It has the largest number of tail vertebrae known in any mammal.  Classification  The genus was once considered to be marsupials; later it was reclassified with the placental mammals, as ancestors of the Carnivora and the extinct Creodonta. Recent researchers have agreed the species assigned to Cimolestes are primitive eutherian mammals, members of a Cimolestid clade (an order or family named after the genus), part of the larger clade Didelphodonta (a superorder or order, not to be confused with the marsupial clade Didelphimorphia). Didelphodonts have been placed within the Ferae, as a sister group to Carnivora. However, consensus is emerging that modern placental mammals evolved later than previously thought,O'Leary, Maureen A., Jonathan I. Bloch, John J. Flynn, Timothy J.

Cimolestes in particular follows as the direct outgroup to Taeniodonta, indicating that the latter evolved from forms similar to it.  Reassigned species  In order to make the genus reflect an actual group of most closely related species, three nominal species of Cimolestes, C. magnus, C. cerberoides, and C. propalaeoryctes, have been reassigned to their own genera, Altacreodus, Ambilestes, and Scollardius, respectively.

Early life  Peggy van Praagh was born in London and was of Dutch, Scottish and English descent. Her father, Harold John van Praagh, was a British physician with a Jewish background and her mother was Ethel Louise n√©e Shanks. She was educated at King Alfred School, London where she meet A.S. Neill who heavily influenced her passion for dance through artistic thinking and creativity which aided her in the dance community. Throughout the course her schooling, she was involved in a series of plays and productions. Dancing She began dancing very early in London at the age of 4. One review stated: \\"At last night's concert a dainty extra was a very charming dance by little Peggy van Praagh ... Peggy is only six but she is quite a clever little artiste and is booked again for Saturday's matinee by request.\\" Late in 1929, van Praagh was offered a two- week position at a small company formed by (Sir) Anton Dolin. Despite the brief engagement, it allowed her to become a student of Margaret Craske where she studied mime with Tamara Karsavina, repertoire with Lydia Sokolova, modern expressionist dance with Gertrud Bodenwieser and ballet history with Cyril W. Beaumont. Van Praagh joined Ballet Rambert in 1933. Later she also danced with Antony Tudor's London Ballet. Van Praagh performed in some of Tudor's ballets such as Jardin aux Lilas (otherwise Lilac Garden), Dark Elegies, Gala Performance, Soir√©e musicale and The Planets. In the early years of World War II, she was heavily involved in staging lunch time ballet shows called Ballet for a Bob, which attracted large audiences of civilian and military personnel. In 1941, she was employed by Ninette de Valois largely to teach company classes for Sadler's Wells Ballet, although van Praagh also danced in a number of company productions including Les Patineurs, Comus and Coppelia in which she danced the leading role of Swanilda.

She worked there until 1956. During this time she maintained a long, fruitful association with choreographer Antony Tudor. From 1956 until 1960 she undertook freelance teaching and producing in Germany, Canada, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands and the US. Artistic Director of the Borovansky and Australian Ballet In 1959, on the recommendation of Ninette de Valois, van Praagh was appointed Artistic Director of the Borovansky Ballet in 1960. Following the demise of the Borovansky Ballet in 1961 and its subsequent reformation as Australian Ballet, she became its founding artistic director in 1962, where she remained until 1974, and was invited back again for the 1978 season. From 1965‚Äì1974, van Praagh held the position jointly with Sir Robert Helpmann. Under van Praagh's direction, the Australian Ballet made the first of many overseas tours, developed a repertoire of ballets that included works from the established international repertoire as well as commissioned works from Australian and overseas choreographers, and hosted guest appearances by a number of notable dancers including Sonia Arova, Erik Bruhn, Dame Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev. While with the Australian Ballet, she also nurtured the development of Australian choreographers including Graeme Murphy, Ian Spink, John Meehan and Leigh Warren. Marilyn Rowe, a prot√©g√© of van Praagh, and later Director of the Australian Ballet School said of her mentor: \\"Peggy had a five point plan for the development of the Australian Ballet:\\" # A company of dancers engaged on annual contracts. Such contracts were heretofore unknown, # A repertoire of established classics together with the best works by contemporary choreographers, designers and composers # To present, as guest artists, the world's best dancers and teachers # To tour the company internationally # To establish a national ballet school\\" Marilyn Rowe OBE, The Sixth Dame Peggy van Praagh Memorial Lecture, 18 November 2000 , Australian Dance Council Dance advocate Van Praagh was an advocate for dance education. During her career in Australia, along with Bernard James of the University of New England's continuing education program, she was instrumental in organising a series of summer schools in dance that had a long-lasting influence on dance in Australia. She also helped establish the advocacy body, Ausdance (formerly Australian Association for Dance Education). In 1982, van Praagh was coordinator of dance studies at the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts, Edith Cowan University, Perth. On 15 January 1990, she died in Melbourne.

He is also known for being the original concept writer for Sola and Sora no Method. He later wrote the scenario for the action role-playing game Crystar. He also does work in a d≈çjin circle named Cork Board. Career Naoki Hisaya debuted as the main scenario writer for the adult visual novel developer Tactics under Nexton in 1997. He first worked on the company's second title Moon, followed by One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e in 1998. After One's completion, Hisaya and much of the staff who made both Moon and One, including Jun Maeda, Itaru Hinoue, Shinji Orito, and OdiakeS, left Tactics to work under the video game publishing company VisualArt's where they formed the company Key. At Key, Hisaya worked on the planning and most of the scenario for Kanon, released in 1999, but following the completion of Kanon, quit Key. Afterwards, Hisaya formed the d≈çjin circle Cork Board and participated at Comiket and C Revo, another comic convention, between 1999 and 2002.

At its zenith, the mill employed 30 people and used logs driven down the Castor River. By 1866, Kenmore was a post village with a population of about 80 of the township of Osgoode, on the Castor creek; the postmaster was Moses E. Tabid. It contained three stores, one flouring and saw mill, pearl ash factory and tannery. There was one church, Baptist, erected in 1851, of frame.

Early life and career Joseph was born in Upper Clapton, London. He served in the British Army during the First World War, and then embarked on a writing career, his first book being Short Story Writing for Profit (1923). After a period as a literary agent for Curtis Brown, Joseph founded his own publishing imprint as a subsidiary of Victor Gollancz Ltd. Gollancz invested ¬£4000 in Michael Joseph Ltd, established 5 September 1935. Joseph and Victor Gollancz disagreed on many points and Michael Joseph bought out Gollancz Ltd in 1938 after Gollancz attempted to censor Across the Frontiers by Sir Philip Gibbs on political grounds. (Joseph published the first edition in 1938 and a revised edition the following May.) Joseph managed to build up an impressive list of authors, such as H. E. Bates, C. S. Forester, Monica Dickens, and Richard Llewellyn. Personal life Joseph married actress Hermione Gingold in 1918 and had two sons, Leslie and Stephen Joseph. (The Stephen Joseph Theatre in Scarborough, established by the latter in 1955, was Britain's first theatre in the round.) The couple divorced in 1926 and Joseph promptly married Edna Victoria Nellie Frost, with whom he had a daughter Shirley and son Richard. Richard established a very successful career in printing and then later running his own publishing company. He and his wife, Elizabeth, had a son, Adam Joseph and daughter, Rachel Joseph. Edna died in 1949 and Joseph's third marriage the next year was to Anthea Esther Hodson, with whom he had a daughter Charlotte and son Hugh.

The TZ was built both for street and racing trim, with the latest racing versions producing up to . Alfa's twin-spark cylinder head, as also used in their GTA, contributed to the speed of the TZ; the standard Giulia alloy block with wet steel liners was installed at an angle under the hood of the TZ to improve airflow. Aiding the TZ in its quest for performance was the treatment of the rear bodywork. Incorporating the research of Dr. Wunibald Kamm, the TZ used a style called in Italian, meaning \\"short tail.\\", otherwise known as the Kamm tail. The principle is that unless an aircraft-like extended tail is incorporated, which is not practical for an automobile, there is little, if any, increase in drag and a marked decrease in lift or even some downforce by simply chopping off a portion of the tail. Zagato had previously proved the success of this tail treatment in their Sprint Zagato sports-racing cars, and it was a natural evolution to adapt this to the Giulia TZ. The car debuted at the 1963 FISA Monza Cup, where TZs took the first four places in the prototype category. At the beginning of 1964 the TZ was homologated (100 units were needed for homologation) to the Gran Turismo category. After homologation it started to take more class wins in Europe and North-America. Of the first TZ, 112 units were built between 1963 and 1965.

In order to reinforce the structure and further reduce the car's weight, Zagato replaced the light alloy body with an even more streamlined fibreglass body moulded tight to the chassis providing lower drag and reduced weight of . The new design was called the Alfa Romeo Giulia TZ2.

With this engine the car reached top speed of . The rear window was also changed, now single unit rather than three part window in TZ. Development of TZ cars was stopped in the end of 1965, to make room for the new Alfa Romeo GTA racing program. Only 12 TZ2s were built. The car won the prestigious Gran Turismo Trophy at the 2009 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance. Race results The TZ2 took class win on 25 April 1965 in the 1000 km of Monza, with Bussinello-De Adamich finishing seventh overall and first in the GT 1600 category.

TZ3 A homage to the TZ3 was made in two different iterations in 2010, celebrating Alfa Romeo's centenary. Zagato TZ3 Corsa Alfa Romeo TZ3 rear end The Alfa Romeo TZ3 Corsa is the track version of the TZ3 (hence the name TZ3 Corsa, Corsa meaning race in Italian) built to celebrate 100 years (a century) of Alfa Romeo in racing. The Corsa is a one-off car that was first presented at and won, the 2010 Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este in Italy. It is based on the Alfa Romeo 8C Competizione and was made for German collector Martin Kapp. The car weighs thanks to its carbon fibre frame and hand beaten aluminium body panels and has a dry sump 4.2 litre V8 engine. The car has a 6-speed automated manual gearbox and can attain a top speed of over . It can accelerate from zero to in 3.5 seconds. The chassis is a carbon-fiber monocoque with some tubular elements. The suspension setup, front and rear, are double wishbones, with pushrod actuated coil springs, and dampers from Ohlins. Zagato TZ3 Stradale Jenson Button driving a TZ3 Stradale at Goodwood FoS 2012 The Alfa Romeo TZ3 Stradale is the road version of the TZ3 (hence the name TZ3 Stradale, stradale meaning road in Italian), designed by Norihiko Harada of Zagato, and was built to celebrate 100 years of Alfa Romeo on the road. The TZ3's chassis is based on the Dodge Viper ACR-X, and has been re-bodied to suit road conditions. Only nine units of the vehicle have been made. The TZ3 is powered by the ACR-X's odd-firing 8.4-liter Viper all- aluminum 90¬∞ OHV 2-valve V10, but its power has been reduced to at 6,100 rpm, and of torque at 5,000 rpm. Redline is reached at 6,250 rpm. All of this power is delivered to the rear wheels, via a 6-speed Tremec TR6060 manual transmission. The interior design is mainly the same as a regular Viper, but has Alfa Romeo badging. The body and the frame come from the ACR-X, which are manufactured with SMC & rim panels over a tubular space frame. The brake discs, which are 2-piece, come from StopTech, and the calipers are from Brembo. The steering wheel is rack-and-pinion, with power assist. The suspension setup for front and rear are A-arms, with coil-over shocks and stabilizer bars.

It includes three major steps: * Lipolysis of and release from adipose tissue * Activation and transport into mitochondria * Œ≤-oxidation Lipolysis and release Initially in the process of degradation, fatty acids are stored in fat cells (adipocytes). The breakdown of this fat is known as lipolysis. The products of lipolysis, free fatty acids, are released into the bloodstream and circulate throughout the body. During the breakdown of triacylglycerols into fatty acids, more than 75% of the fatty acids are converted back into triacylglycerol, a natural mechanism to conserve energy, even in cases of starvation and exercise. Activation and transport into mitochondria Fatty acids must be activated before they can be carried into the mitochondria, where fatty acid oxidation occurs. This process occurs in two steps catalyzed by the enzyme fatty acyl-CoA synthetase. Formation of an activated thioester bond The enzyme first catalyzes nucleophilic attack on the Œ±-phosphate of ATP to form pyrophosphate and an acyl chain linked to AMP. The next step is formation of an activated thioester bond between the fatty acyl chain and Coenzyme A. center The balanced equation for the above is: RCOO‚àí \\\\+ CoASH + ATP ‚Üí RCO-SCoA + AMP + PPi This two-step reaction is freely reversible and its equilibrium lies near 1. To drive the reaction forward, the reaction is coupled to a strongly exergonic hydrolysis reaction: the enzyme inorganic pyrophosphatase cleaves the pyrophosphate liberated from ATP to two phosphate ions, consuming one water molecule in the process. Thus the net reaction becomes: RCOO‚àí \\\\+ CoASH + ATP ‚Üí RCO-SCoA+ AMP + 2Pi Transport into the mitochondrial matrix The inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to fatty acids and a specialized carnitine carrier system operates to transport activated fatty acids from cytosol to mitochondria. Once activated, the acyl CoA is transported into the mitochondrial matrix. This occurs via a series of similar steps: # Acyl CoA is conjugated to carnitine by carnitine acyltransferase I (palmitoyltransferase) I located on the outer mitochondrial membrane # Acyl carnitine is shuttled inside by a translocase # Acyl carnitine (such as Palmitoylcarnitine) is converted to acyl CoA by carnitine acyltransferase (palmitoyltransferase) II located on the inner mitochondrial membrane. The liberated carnitine returns to the cytosol. It is important to note that carnitine acyltransferase I undergoes allosteric inhibition as a result of malonyl-CoA, an intermediate in fatty acid biosynthesis, in order to prevent futile cycling between beta- oxidation and fatty acid synthesis. The mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids takes place in three major steps: # Œ≤-oxidation occurs to convert fatty acids into 2-carbon acetyl-CoA units. # Acetyl-CoA enters into TCA cycle to yield generate reduced NADH and reduced FADH2. # Reduced cofactors NADH and FADH2 participate in the electron transport chain in the mitochondria to yield ATP. There is no direct participation of the fatty acid. Œ≤-oxidation After activation by ATP, once inside the mitochondria, the Œ≤-oxidation of a fatty acids occurs via four recurring steps: #Oxidation by FAD #Hydration #Oxidation by NAD+ # Thiolysis # Production of acyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA The final product of Œ≤-oxidation of an even-numbered fatty acid is acetyl-CoA, the entry molecule for the citric acid cycle. If the fatty acid is an odd-numbered chain, the final product of Œ≤-oxidation will be propionyl-CoA. This propionyl- CoA will be converted into intermediate methylmalonyl-CoA and eventually succinyl-CoA, which also enters the TCA cycle.

He led the first return journey to the South Pole on foot via Shackleton and Scott's route in 2013‚Äì14,http://www.adventure-network.com/news/monumental-journey-completed and skied solo to the North Pole in 2004.http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail254.html Saunders has skied more than 3,700 miles (6,000 km) on polar expeditions since 2001. He holds the record for the longest human-powered polar journey in history (2,888 km) and for the longest solo Arctic journey by a Briton (1,032 km). Biography The elder of two boys, Saunders grew up in Devon and Kent, was educated at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, and worked as an instructor at the John Ridgway School of Adventure. He is a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, an Ambassador for the Prince's Trust, a Patron of British Exploring, a supporter of The Duke of Edinburgh's Award and the Orchid Cancer Appeal, a past Honorary Vice-President of the Geographical Association, and an honorary member of the Cordon Rouge Club. In July 2016 Saunders was awarded an Honorary Fellowship by the University of Northampton.http://www.northampton.ac.uk/news/ben-saunders-honorary- fellowship/ Saunders has contributed to publications including Worldchanging: A User's Guide for the 21st Century and 'The Middle of Nowhere' published by Lonely Planet. He also spoke at the 2005 and 2014 main stage TED conferences. Expeditions=North Pole Saunders first attempted to reach the North Pole in 2001 on a two-man unsupported expedition led by Pen Hadow that started from the Arctic Cape in Siberia, Russia. The pair were unsuccessful in attaining the Pole but reached a point close to 87¬∞ North, after 59 days on the Arctic Ocean. In April 2003, Saunders completed a 240 km solo round-trip to the North Pole from the temporary Russian ice station, Barneo. In spring 2004, he set out to make a solo and unsupported crossing of the Arctic Ocean on foot, following a planned route from the Arctic Cape to Ward Hunt Island, Canada, via the North Pole.http://www.sercotransarctic.com/ Saunders was dropped off by a Russian Mil Mi-8 helicopter on 5 March 2004, reached the North Pole on 11 May 2004, and was picked up on the Canadian side of the Arctic Ocean by a Kenn Borek Air Twin Otter ski plane on 14 May 2004. Saunders' claim to have reached the North Pole solo in 2004 is disputed by ExplorersWeb,http://www.explorersweb.com/ a website maintained by explorers Thomas and Tina Sj√∂gren, who consider only expeditions that begin their journey on land to be valid. His 2004 expedition started 70 km north of Siberia's Cape Arktichevsky, with his online journal reporting 50 km of open water north of the Russian coastline that prevented him starting from land.http://www.sercotransarctic.com/dispatches/mar/05/alone_and_shreezing ExplorersWeb listed Saunders' 2004 journey to the North Pole as a \\"partial expedition\\" on their database of expedition records.http://www.adventurestats.com/tables/npall.shtml In 2004, Australian explorer Eric Philips argued that this categorization of expeditions may have been a factor in the death of Finnish explorer Dominick Arduin, who died at the Arctic Cape in March 2004: \\"I can't help but think that this tragedy permeated as a result of the pressure placed on adventurers to have their expeditions regarded as unsupported. Again, Explorers Web and others are placing undue pressure on the adventuring community by categorizing expeditions on their achievements... we should not be pressured into feeling that our efforts fall short of somebody else's parameters.\\"http://www.icetrek.com/index.php?id=237 On 27 March 2008, Saunders set out from Ward Hunt Island, Canada, with the aim of setting a speed record.http://north.bensaunders.com/ The current record, 36 days 22 hours, was set in 2005 by a team guided by Canadian Matty McNair using dog sleds and numerous air-drops of food. In contrast, Saunders set out solo, unsupported, and on foot; he was halted after eight days, on 4 April 2008, due to a broken ski binding. A second speed record attempt in March 2010 was unable to start due to a three-week period of adverse weather conditions on the far north of Canada's Ellesmere Island.  South Pole  Between October 2013 and February 2014, Saunders and Tarka L'Herpiniere made the first return journey to the South Pole from Ross Island on the same route attempted by Sir Ernest Shackleton on the Nimrod Expedition, and by Robert Falcon Scott on the Terra Nova Expedition. At 1,795 miles (2,888 km) the Scott Expedition is the longest human-powered polar journey in history. Saunders and L'Herpiniere set out from Ross Island on 26 October 2013, reached the South Pole on 26 December 2013http://scottexpedition.com/blog/a-big-day-out,/ and finished their expedition at Ross Island again on 7 February 2014.http://scottexpedition.com/blog/ben-and-tarka-make-history The journey was not unsupported, since some supplies had to be delivered by air on their return journey. Robert Swan OBE and Falcon Scott (Captain Scott's grandson) were patrons of the expedition.

Roberts (born April 17, 1957) was the 68th Lieutenant Governor of the State of Rhode Island from 2007 to 2015. She served in that position during the administrations of Republican Governor Donald Carcieri and Independent-turned Democrat Lincoln Chafee. She was elected as a Democrat in 2006, becoming the state's first female Lieutenant Governor and was succeeded by Daniel McKee on January 6, 2015. She later served as Secretary of Health and Human Services during the administration of Governor Gina Raimondo, but subsequently resigned due to a widely-criticized statewide computer system rollout. Personal life Roberts graduated from Brown University in 1978 and earned an MBA in Health Care Management from Boston University in 1984. Prior to entering politics, Roberts has worked as a business strategy consultant, policy analyst, and health care manager. She is married to Thomas Roberts and they have two grown children. The Roberts family resides in Cranston, Rhode Island. Early political career=Rhode Island State Senate Roberts served five two-year terms in the Rhode Island Senate from 1996 until 2006. During her tenure in the state Senate, she was an activist for health and medical issues. Roberts also focused on economic development and job growth, and pushed for cleaner air and water, stronger schools, and increased attention to disaster preparedness. During her tenure in the state Senate she served as the Chairwoman of the Senate Health and Human Services Committee. Later, she served as a Co-Chair of Permanent Joint Committee on Healthcare Oversight, which she used as a vehicle to push for reform for Blue Cross and Blue Shield, the largest provider of health insurance in Rhode Island. Roberts also helped expand the state‚Äôs prescription drug program for seniors (RIPAE) and helped expand coverage to more families through Rite Care, the state's public health system. The reform organization Common Cause named Roberts one of the top two senators in Rhode Island in 2006, giving her the second highest rating in the General Assembly at 91% and an ‚ÄúA‚Äù for her reform efforts during the legislative session. Lieutenant Governor Roberts was elected the state's first female Lieutenant Governor on November 7, 2006. She was inaugurated as the 68th Lieutenant Governor of Rhode Island on January 2, 2007. She toyed with the idea of running for Governor in the 2010 election, but instead decided to run for re-election as Lieutenant Governor. Secretary of Health and Human Services After the 2014 election in which Roberts did not stand for election, Governor-elect Gina Raimondo announced Roberts as her nominee for the office of Secretary of the Executive Office of Health and Human Services. Computer system failure and resignation In February 2017, Roberts resigned from her post in the Raimondo administration. She left the cabinet-level post for a variety of reasons, but the roll-out of the botched Unified Health Infrastructure Project (a new statewide computer network) overshadowed her tenure. The disastrous UHIP computer network launch in September 2016 saw scores of people without access government to programs such as food stamps and child care due to glitches in the software, designed by Deloitte.

From 1969 to 1973, Bertelsmann acquired a majority share in the company and gradually increased it over time. Since 2014, the company has been a fully owned subsidiary of the G√ºtersloh-based media and services group. Under the leadership and innovation strategy of Julia J√§kel, Gruner + Jahr has evolved into a publishing house producing cross-channel media products for the digital society. With more than 500 magazines and digital products and services, Gruner + Jahr is one of Europe's largest premium magazine publishing companies. Its activities primarily focus on Germany and France. Among the most well-known media brands are Brigitte, Capital, Geo, and Stern, along with Chefkoch.de and Stern.de. In addition, Gruner + Jahr owns a share in Spiegel Verlag.  History = 1965‚Äì1969  Gerd Bucerius, Richard Gruner, and John Jahr in 1968 Gruner + Jahr was founded in 1965 by Richard Gruner, John Jahr, and Gerd Bucerius. Bucerius and Jahr published magazines, and Gruner ran a printing firm. The impetus for the three entrepreneurs to merge was the need to achieve positive economies of scale, for example with regard to purchasing paper for the printing firms or to the distribution of magazines via reading circles. The merger was promoted mainly by Gerd Bucerius, and the magazines that the shareholders brought into the company formed the basis for the joint business of Gruner + Jahr. The key magazines were, among others, Brigitte, Capital, Stern, and . By 1965, they had a joint circulation running into the millions. The company Gruner + Jahr was established as a limited liability partnership, in which Gruner held 39.5%, Jahr 32.3%, and Bucerius 28.2% of the shares. By 1968, sales had grown to over 400 million Deutsche Mark. This made Gruner + Jahr Germany's largest press company at the time, next to Axel Springer. In 1969, Richard Gruner stepped down from the company. Differences concerning the political and strategic orientation of the publishing house prompted this move. Gruner gave up his shares to his co-shareholders, Bucerius and Jahr, who for a short time each owned 50%. Both subsequently sold 25% of Gruner + Jahr to Bertelsmann. In 1970, Bucerius and Jahr transitioned into the newly created supervisory board, and management responsibility was entrusted to a five- person executive board. In 1971, with a view to strengthening the management's independence, the company converted the general partner (shareholder with unlimited liability) of Gruner + Jahr into a stock corporation. Following his retirement from the operative business, in 1973 Bucerius swapped his shares in Gruner + Jahr for an equity stake in Bertelsmann. As a result, the group advanced to become the majority shareholder in Gruner + Jahr, and, by 1975, Bertelsmann had increased its share to a total of 74.9%. Upon the retirement of Bucerius, the rights to the weekly newspaper Die Zeit were transferred to a foundation in order to safeguard the publication's business independence over the long term.  1960s, 70s and 80s  In the 1960s and 1970s, the business of Gruner + Jahr was initially focused on expanding activities in the German market. An example of this was the acquisition of minority shareholdings in Spiegel Verlag and Vereinigte Motor-Verlage (today ) in the year 1971. At the end of the 1970s, the company then embarked on a period of expansion abroad: In France, the subsidiary Participations Edition Presse (today ) was established in 1978, and that same year, Gruner + Jahr acquired the Spanish publishing company and the US printing firm Brown Printing. In the 1980s, additional shareholdings and subsidiaries were acquired abroad, for example in Great Britain. , 2004 By the mid-1980s, the employees of Gruner + Jahr were spread throughout various buildings along Hamburg's Outer Alster Lake. To promote collaboration within the publishing house and to create space for additional staff, construction of a press building on Baumwall began in 1985. The company's headquarters remain at that address to this day. The property on which the press building was built is situated between St. Michael's Church and the Speicherstadt. It was previously owned by the City of Hamburg and has floor space of 22,000 m¬≤. Construction work was largely completed in 1989, and the first employees moved into the press building one year later. The building project cost roughly 300 million Deutsche Mark. At the time the press building was commissioned, it offered space for 2,000 employees and was thus Hamburg's largest inner-city office block.  1990s  Following the German reunification in 1989/90, Gruner + Jahr was instrumental in building up a free press in the new German states. For example, the company founded the and, shortly thereafter, the daily newspaper. In 1991, Gruner + Jahr acquired the S√§chsisches Druck- und Verlagshaus, where the S√§chsische Zeitung is published. The company also acquired a stake in Berliner Verlag ‚Äì initially 50% in 1990, then 100% from 1992 on. Among its leading newspapers are Berliner Zeitung and Berliner Kurier. Internationally, Gruner + Jahr attracted a lot of attention by acquiring seven magazines belonging to The New York Times Company. In 1994, the company advanced to become a leading US publishing house and, for the first time in its history, generated half of its sales revenues outside of Germany. In 1995, Gruner + Jahr launched websites under the domains geo.de, mopo.de, pm-magazin.de, stern.de and tvtoday.de as one of the first professional service providers on the world wide web. In the years that followed, digital business models assumed an ever-greater importance: In 1997, the company launched Fireball, a search engine specially geared towards German-language content. This was followed by in 1998, a search engine specializing in news. An e-mail provider (Firemail) was also part of the portfolio. In the year 2000, Gruner + Jahr incorporated Fireball and its related brands into Lycos Europe. In exchange, Gruner + Jahr received a stake in the company, the IPO of which was imminent. From the end of 2000, following the bursting of the dot-com bubble, Gruner + Jahr once again concentrated on content-based services, that is, on the websites of its media brands.  Initiatives and crisis  At around the turn of the millennium, Gruner + Jahr sold off several regional daily newspapers. In 1999, the company divested itself of the , a free Sunday newspaper. The deficit-ridden Hamburger Morgenpost was sold in 1999 to Hans Barlach and Frank Otto. In addition, Gruner + Jahr divested itself of several regional editions of the S√§chsische Zeitung. At the same time, the company established Financial Times Deutschland, a new Germany-wide business newspaper. This initiative was one of the most ambitious newspaper projects of the time. In the year 2000, Gruner + Jahr purchased Inc. and Fast Company, two leading business magazines. In 2002, Gruner + Jahr sold the Berliner Verlag publishing company to the Georg von Holtzbrinck publishing group. Due to the concentration in the Berlin newspaper market, some media commented critically on the transaction. In 2003, Gruner + Jahr sold off parts of its newspaper business in Eastern Europe to the Ringier group. After selling Berliner Verlag, Gruner + Jahr once again focused on its business with magazines and printing firms. In mid-2003, the company began developing various new magazines, with Neon and Brigitte Woman among its new German market launches. Gruner + Jahr continued to expand, despite an increasingly difficult market environment. The company further pursued this strategy in the years that followed and planned additional acquisitions, but prescribed a regimen of belt-tightening in Germany and the United States. In 2004, Gruner + Jahr, in cooperation with Arvato and Axel Springer, founded the printing service provider . One year later, in 2005, Gruner + Jahr sold off its entire US business to Meredith Corporation, and Cond√© Nast acquired one individual youth magazine. The company thus largely exited the US market, where, up to that time, it had been the sixth-largest magazine publisher. Due to the global financial crisis and worldwide economic downturn, from 2007 Gruner + Jahr was forced to close several magazines. The company was economically healthy and debt-free, yet it was combating declining ad revenues. Irrespective of this trend, Gruner + Jahr introduced new magazines onto the market. Following the losses of the previous year, the company returned to the profit zone in 2010. As part of strategic transformation activities, the executive board was restructured, and in 2013, Julia J√§kel became Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Whereas the digital business sector became more and more important, printing operations waned in significance: After Prinovis announced in 2013 that the former Gruner printing company in Itzehoe would be closing, Gruner + Jahr divested itself of its US subsidiary Brown Printing in 2014. This meant a \\"turning point\\" for the company because it marked the selling off of the company's last operative business in the United States.  Bertelsmann era  In 2014, Bertelsmann came to an agreement with the heirs of John Jahr concerning the purchase of their remaining shares of 25.1%. The takeover was intended to signify a commitment to journalism. Bertelsmann thus strengthened its journalism business, especially through the established media brands of Gruner + Jahr. The executive board of Gruner + Jahr was confirmed and the company re-introduced the legal entity used up until 1971 (limited partnership). Gruner + Jahr then intensified its cooperation with other Bertelsmann companies. Territory is an example for this strategic shift. Over the past few years, Gruner + Jahr, under the leadership of Julia J√§kel, has been vastly transformed and strategically repositioned. In 2016, Gruner + Jahr sold its magazine business in Spain to an investor and withdrew from Austria. By expanding digital activities and innovation in the area of traditional magazines, Gruner + Jahr's business has continued its successful expansion. The company has expanded its digital services and developed into one of the key market players in digital marketing. Furthermore, in 2017, the marketing arm of Gruner + Jahr in cooperation with the RTL-subsidiary IP Deutschland and Smartclip, established the Ad Alliance, under the umbrella of which new services have been developed for advertisers and agencies. The Ad Alliance's cross-media platform reaches more than 99% of the German population monthly, and Spiegel Media and Media Impact have now also joined it. In 2017, Gruner + Jahr announced it was moving to HafenCity and building new headquarters. The modern new building, will reflect the innovation strategy being pursued by Gruner + Jahr. The press building at Baumwall was sold to the city, which wants to use it for its own purposes after Gruner + Jahr's move has been completed.  Corporate structure  Julia J√§kel, 2017 The group holding company is Gruner + Jahr GmbH, headquartered in Hamburg. It is a limited liability company (GmbH) under German law, and its shareholders are Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA, as well as two holding companies which are also part of the Bertelsmann Group. Three people sit on the executive board of Gruner + Jahr GmbH: Julia J√§kel is Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Oliver Radtke is Chief Operating Officer (COO), and Stephan Sch√§fer is Chief Product Officer (CPO). Their contracts were last renewed in 2018 for five years. Gruner + Jahr is one of eight corporate divisions of Bertelsmann. The annual financial statements are included in the consolidated financial statements, and not separately published. In the 2019 business year, Gruner + Jahr achieved sales of 1.4 billion euros. Gruner + Jahr owns companies and hold equity participation in several companies in Germany and abroad, including Prisma Media, for example.  Products and services = Magazines  The most important German-language magazines of Gruner + Jahr in terms of popularity and scope are Brigitte, Capital, , Eltern family, , Essen & Trinken f√ºr jeden Tag, Gala, Geo, National Geographic Deutschland, P.M. Magazin, Sch√∂ner Wohnen, and Stern. Since 2013, all publications from Gruner + Jahr have been clustered into eight units called \\"Communities of Interest.\\" Both print and digital cross-media content is created there.  Digital brands  In the last few years, Gruner + Jahr has significantly increased its digital activities. Sales in the digital field have experienced exceptional growth over the past years. In its core markets, digital sales account for more than a third of total sales. Gruner + Jahr invests not only in its own platforms but also in the services of third parties: For example, a start-up fund was launched in 2015, and in 2016, an online shop was created under the Sch√∂ner Wohnen brand. The ad-tech company AppLike, established in 2016, was spun off in 2017 thanks to its strong growth.  Other = Nannen Prize  In 2004, Gruner + Jahr joined forces with Stern to create the Henri Nannen Prize, which since 2016 has been referred to simply as the . The award honors outstanding journalistic achievements in categories such as reporting, documentation, and photography. The role model for the Henri Nannen Prize was the Egon Erwin Kisch Prize, created in 1977 by Henri Nannen. It developed into one of the most renowned journalism prizes in the German-speaking region and today is continued as a category of the Nannen Prize. Peter Scholl-Latour was the first journalist and author to receive the Henri Nannen Prize in 2005 for his life's work as a journalist. Other laureates have included former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt (2010). Gruner + Jahr regularly honors special achievements in the service of press freedom with a special award, which Laura Poitras received in 2014 for her involvement in the uncovering of the global surveillance and spying affair by Edward Snowden.  Henri Nannen School  Gruner + Jahr did not train journalists in the 1960s and 70s. In 1978, this changed: The Henri Nannen School was established, modeled after the German School of Journalism. It was initially called the Hamburg School of Journalism and, in 1983, received the name it bears today, in honor of the Stern founder, Henri Nannen. Wolf Schneider was integrally involved in its founding and served as its director for 16 years. Today, the Henri-Nannen School is based in Hamburg's . The school provides training for newspaper, magazine, radio, television, and online journalists across various genres. The Henri Nannen School is a limited liability company, backed up by the Gruner + Jahr, Die Zeit and Der Spiegel publishing houses.  Controversy  In 1983, the company was clouded by the affair surrounding the alleged Hitler diaries. The affair was to go down in history as Stern's greatest ever miscalculation and caused significant damage to the public image of Gruner + Jahr and Bertelsmann. Stern magazine subsequently suffered a severe decline in circulation, which proved to be only temporary, however. Gruner + Jahr and Bertelsmann responded with severe personnel consequences. For example, the magazine's publisher, Henri Nannen, was forced to resign, even though he personally had done nothing wrong. Today, the publishing of the alleged Hitler diaries is considered a textbook example of failure in the field of media ethics. In 2013, Gruner + Jahr announced it would be handing over the forged Hitler diaries to the German Federal Archives. To date, this has not occurred; the forged Hitler diaries are still archived in the Gruner + Jahr publishing house.

After the death in January 1515 of George Brown, Bishop of Dunkeld, a new bishop was needed for that bishopric. Queen Margaret, husband of the recently deceased James IV and mother of the young James V, backed to succeed Brown one Gavin Douglas, a poet and cleric who was Provost of St Giles church in Edinburgh.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 83. He was the uncle of the queen's new husband, Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus.Bawcutt, \\"Douglas, Gavin (c.1476‚Äì1522)\\". The queen had put him forward on 20 January 1515, just a few days after Brown's death. Douglas had lately missed out on the position of Archbishop of St Andrews, and so this was in some way intended as compensation.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, pp. 99, 297-8. Douglas had a proctor pay 450 florins to the Papal see, and Pope Leo X confirmed his position on 25 May.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 99; Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 83. Meanwhile, Andrew Stewart's brother John Stewart, 2nd Earl of Atholl, pressured the chapter of Dunkeld Cathedral to elect Andrew to the see instead of Douglas. Alexander Myln, in his 16th century Vitae Dunkeldensis ecclesiae episcoporum (\\"Lives of the Bishops of Dunkeld\\"), related that after hearing news of Bishop Brown's death, Atholl visited Dunkeld and requested that his brother be made bishop.Myln, Vitae Dunkeldensis, pp. 70‚Äì1. As many of the canons were either related by blood to Atholl, or else held lands under Atholl's power, the pressure was significant and Andrew Stewart was accordingly elected to the see.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 82. A letter was sent to John Stewart, Duke of Albany, Governor of Scotland and guardian of the young James V of Scotland; Albany was in France and refused to deal with the disposal of any bishopric until his return to the country. When Albany returned in May (still 1515), he subverted Queen Margaret, confirmed the appointment of Andrew and compelled the chapter of Dunkeld to hand over the temporalities of the see.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 99; Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 82. In July, the Queen agreed to Andrew Stewart's appointment and Albany imprisoned Douglas for breaking the laws of the kingdom, that is, on account of his purchase of the bishopric at Rome.Bawcutt, \\"Douglas, Gavin (c.1476‚Äì1522)\\"; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 99; Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, pp. 82, 83. However, Andrew Stewart failed to secure confirmation from the Papacy. Albany gave up his support for Andrew and released Douglas from imprisonment; in September 1516, he agreed to Douglas' accession to the see of Dunkeld. Douglas was consecrated on 21 September 1516.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 99. On 24 July 1517, Albany wrote to the Pope requesting that Andrew Stewart be given the now vacant see of Caithness. The Pope agreed, and on 14 December 1517, Andrew Stewart became Bishop of Caithness.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 61; Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 248. Thereafter, the sources leave almost no information about Stewart, and his 24-year rule of the diocese of Caithness goes largely undocumented, save only the occasional appearance, such as his attendance at parliament on 10 December 1540.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 248, n. 1. He died intestate some short time before 9 August 1541.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 61; Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 2498.

Vamsee Juluri, author and Professor of Media Studies at the University of San Francisco, identified Indophobic bias and prejudice in Crossette's writings. Specifically, he accuses Crossette of libelling a secularist, pluralistic, liberal democracy and an ally of the United States as a \\"rogue nation\\" and describing India as \\"pious,\\" \\"craving,\\" \\"petulant,\\" \\"intransigent,\\" and \\"believes that the world's rules don't apply to it\\". Juluri identifies these attacks as part of a racist postcolonial/neocolonial discourse used by Crosette to attack and defame India and encourage racial prejudice against Indian Americans.Vamsee Juluri, \\"Indophobia: The Real Elephant in the Living Room\\", HuffPost, March 18, 2010 (updated May 25, 2011).

Crossette's opposition to India's support of Bangladeshi independence has been especially widely discredited for its lack of understanding of the history and international politics of the subcontinent. On 20 August 2020, Crossette in her PassBlue commentary controversially displayed the same indophobia by casually disparaging the appointment of a UN expert, Irene Khan, as raising \\"questions\\", without saying what those questions were and how the appointment of white Americans to similar roles had never raised \\"questions\\" for her. In the same comment, Crossette, who leads what she calls \\"independent\\" reporting on the UN, also dismissed the rights and voices of women that sell sex, and disapproved of the UN's increasing non-usage of the term \\"prostitution\\".

On September 2013 the first Boeing 737-800 landed and took off successfully. Facilities On 27 December 2015, President Joko Widodo inaugurated a new modern terminal at the airport. The larger terminal will be able to provide passenger services for up to 1.5 million passengers per year compared with the capacity of the old terminal of around 150,000 passengers per annum. The new infrastructure is thus expected to encourage a marked increase in the number of tourists coming to the island of Flores and its surroundings. The airport is at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 17/35 with an asphalt surface measuring . In addition, the foundation also extended runway with a length of 2,250 meters and a width of 45 meters which can accommodate aircraft jet medium class such as the Airbus A320, Boeing 737-800, and Boeing 737-900ER.

The river is 250‚Äì400 m wide in this area, and though in the dry season it may be confined to a shallow channel meandering across sandbanks, at the end of the rainy season any bridge has to be able to withstand a full-width, deep and fast- moving flood. The Great East Road runs for most of its length on watersheds at an elevation of around 1000 m, but the river is at an elevation of 390 m at the bottom of the valley. The bridge approaches have to contend with steep rugged slopes and deep ravines covered in forest or thick bush; the area is remote and about 250 km from the nearest city, Lusaka. The First Luangwa Bridge was built in Zambia's colonial era in 1932 as a narrow 300 m long wide steel and reinforced concrete deck on concrete piers and columns, financed, like the Chirundu Bridge and Beit Bridge by the Beit Trust. Its proximity to Mozambique (about 2 km) and Rhodesia (60 km), as well as its status as the only access point within the country for Zambia's Eastern Province, makes it strategically vulnerable in any conflict. After Zambia's independence in 1964, President Kenneth Kaunda's support for freedom fighters in neighbouring countries led to the bridge being destroyed in revenge. The Second Luangwa Bridge (opened in 1968) was built quickly above the first, with aid from Britain which had been the colonial power in Zambia. It is a cable-stayed bridge designed by Freeman Fox & Partners and built by the Redpath Dorman Long. It has a composite steel-reinforced concrete deck 9.8 m wide, two H-shaped steel pylons 42 m tall on two reinforced concrete piers, and steel cables. The main span is 222 m with approach spans of 40 m each. In 1979 the military of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia destroyed the bridge as well as the Chambeshi road and rail bridges in order to stop the planned invasion of their country by the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA). After another two decades of use, the bridge was rehabilitated under a project of the National Road Fund Agency funded by Danish aid.

As of December 2015 the total registered population reached 3,034. Sandy Lake First Nation maintains an affiliation with Nishnawbe Aski Nation, as a signatory to the Treaty 5. Sandy Lake is policed by the Nishnawbe-Aski Police Service, an Aboriginal-based service.

Within this reserve is the community of Sandy Lake, which during the mid-1900s was known as Waabitigweyaang which translates to White River. Associated with the community, the Sandy Lake First Nation maintains seven neighbourhoods grouped into five districts: * Airport / Centre * Big Rock / Ghost Point * Old Sawmill * River * Roman Catholic Sandy Lake is serviced by a Northern Store owned by the North West Company Inc. The community is a fly-in community, serviced by Wasaya, Superior and Perimeter Airlines, and is linked to the rest of the province by a winter ice road that travels southwest towards Deer Lake and Pikangikum, meeting Red Lake via the Nungesser Road, which is open for approximately six weeks during the winter months. Sandy Lake's education is maintained by the Sandy Lake Board of Education, and is serviced by three schools: Thomas Fiddler Memorial Elementary School, Thomas Fiddler Memorial High School, and Washtennigun Christian School. There is also an operational Adult Learning Center, with ties to Confederation College and Lakehead University.

The Head Councillor is Wayne Kakepetum; the other seven Councillors are John McKay, Allan Rae, Fabian Crowe, Russell Kakepetum, Dennis Kakegamic, Yvonne- Fiddler Kakekagumick, and Darren Meekis. In addition to the Governance Council, the Sandy Lake First Nation maintains an Elder Council to advise the Governance Council. Working with the Governance Council, six boards carry out the Council's operations: Community Development Services, Education, Health, Housing, Radio Station, and Recreation. Climate Sandy Lake has a subarctic climate (Dfc) with severely cold winters and mild summers. Transportation Sandy Lake Airport serves the community. Sandy Lake also has the ice/winter road during the winter months for people to drive in and out of the community.

The Court found that such threats should be considered threats of bodily harm under the Criminal Code. Background The case involved one Stephen Joseph McCraw, who was interested in the cheerleaders of the football team Ottawa Rough Riders. One day, he phoned some of the cheerleaders and mailed them letters. The letters stated that he wanted to have sex with them and if necessary would rape them to do it. One letter quoted by the Supreme Court read, McCraw was arrested and the cheerleaders said in court that they had been terrified by the letters. Nevertheless, the judge found that while the letters did threaten rape, they may not have threatened bodily harm. Instead, the judge called the content of the letters an \\"adoring fantasy\\" and said rape can be performed without inflicting physical or emotional damage to the victim. Decision The decision of the Supreme Court was written by Peter Cory. He noted that until 1985, the Criminal Code outlawed any threat to kill or injure a person except threats spoken in front of a person. A major decision on that law was R v Nabis (1975), and the Parliament of Canada afterwards decided a better law was needed. The new law outlawed any kind of threat regarding bodily harm or killing. Cory found that bodily harm does not only mean killing. As the law also referred to \\"serious bodily harm,\\" Cory consulted The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary and found that \\"serious\\" meant \\"substantial\\", so \\"serious bodily harm\\" means substantial damage to the victim's health. Cory concluded that this law would likely cover emotional damage, as the types of bodily harm covered by the law were not limited. The Supreme Court also decided that the new law was meant to guard against threats that terrorize people, and that the law had a significant goal of upholding an individual's freedom. R v LeBlanc (1989) was another case that found that terror was what was important and not whether the crime would actually occur. Cory asserted that \\"Violence is inherent in the act of rape.\\" He explained that in rape, sex and violence are intertwined, and that the rapist is exercising force which may have temporary physical effects but nevertheless potentially permanent emotional impact. Cory said, To back this up, Cory pointed to journal articles describing how victims often become depressed, cannot sleep, feel guilty or devalued, lose trust in people and become uninterested in sex. Thus, for the law not to recognize this would be a step backwards for sensitivity. Aftermath The McCraw case has been cited by the Supreme Court in later cases. For example, in R v CD; R v CDK (2005), the Court noted that while the Youth Criminal Justice Act did not define \\"violent offence\\" and \\"serious bodily harm,\\" McCraw indicated that these phrases referred to substantial damage to a victim's health.R v CD; R v CDK, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 668, para. 20.

For land line area codes, the digit \\"0\\" is added in front when dialing domestic long distance from within Indonesia, but is always omitted when calling from abroad. Instead, callers would use the Indonesian country code +62, followed by the area code, without the \\"0\\". Domestic phone numbers in large cities have 8 digits, and in other areas 7 digits. Mobile phone numbers have a total of 10 or 11 digits for postpaid depending on the operator, whereas prepaid services get 11 to 13 digits determined by the operator. Until October 1999, East Timor was included in the Indonesian telephone numbering plan, using the area codes 0390 (for Dili)Travel Indonesia, Volume 16, 1994, page 46 and 0399 (for Baucau).The Official Catholic Directory for the Year of Our Lord, Part 2, 1999, page 72 To make a phone call to Indonesia from abroad, the following formats are used: For calls to landlines, callers dial +62, followed by the area code and subscriber's number, omitting the '0', hence a number in Jakarta would be dialled as +62 21 xxx xxxx. For calls to mobile wireless phone (GSM) from abroad, callers dial +62, followed by the subscriber's number, omitting the '0', hence +62 8xx xxx xxxx Overview=Numbers in business contact information On business cards and other contact information, telephone numbers might be listed as \\"HP\\" or \\"hunting\\". \\"HP\\" is an abbreviation for \\"hand phone\\" or mobile phone and is pronounced \\"hah p√©h\\". Hand phones might also be referred to as pon-sel (short form of telepon seluler) or telepon genggam (\\"hold-in-the-hand telephone\\"). Hunting refers to an office line in which multiple individual lines are connected so that an incoming call can roll over to another line if the first line is busy. This permits only one number to be published.

Aeneas Coffey ‚Äì Irish Distiller and Inventor Customs and excise officer According to British customs and excise records, Coffey was a remarkable man with widespread interests and multiple talents who rose quickly through the excise service ranks. He was appointed sub-commissioner of Inland Excise and Taxes for the district of Drogheda in 1813. He was appointed Surveyor of Excise for Clonmel and Wicklow in 1815. In 1816 he was promoted to the same post at Cork. By 1818 he was Acting Inspector General of Excise for the whole of Ireland and within two years was promoted to Inspector General of Excise in Dublin, Ireland. He was a strong, determined upholder of the law, but aware of its shortcomings. He survived many nasty skirmishes with illegal distillers and smugglers, particularly in County Donegal in Ulster and in the west of Ireland, where moonshining was most rife. On several occasions he proposed to the government simple, pragmatic solutions to rules and regulations which had hampered legal distillers. Not all of his ideas were accepted. Between 1820 and 1824 he submitted reports and gave evidence to Parliamentary Commissions of Inquiry on many aspects of distilling, including formalising the different spellings of Irish whiskey and Scotch whisky. His 1822 report was solidly backed by the Irish distillers. He believed in making it viable to distill legally, and illegal distilling might largely disappear. He assisted the government in the drafting of the 1823 Excise Act which made it easier to distill legally. It sanctioned the distilling of whiskey in return for a licence fee of ¬£10, and a set payment per gallon of proof spirit. It also provided for the appointment of a single Board of Excise, under Treasury control, for the whole of the United Kingdom, replacing the separate excise boards for England, Scotland and Ireland. The 1823 Excise Act also provided for not more than four assistant commissioners of excise to transact current business in Scotland and Ireland, under the control of the board in London. Aeneas Coffey resigned from government excise service at his own request in 1824. Inventor Between his Dublin education and his work as an excise officer, Aeneas Coffey had ample opportunity to observe the design and workings of whiskey stills, as Ireland was the world's leading producer of whiskey in the 19th century, and Dublin was at the centre of that global industry. This was how Coffey became familiar with a design differing from the traditional copper pot alembic still commonly used in Ireland, the continuous, or column, still. First patented by a Cork County distillery in 1822, the column still remained a relatively inefficient piece of equipment, although it pointed the way towards a cheaper and more productive way to distill alcohol. It was that last point that captured Coffey's imagination. He made his own modifications to existing column still designs, so as to allow a greater portion of the vapours to re-circulate into the still instead of moving into the receiver with the spirit. The result was more efficient, producing a lighter spirit at higher alcohol content. Coffey patented his design in 1830, and it became the basis for every column still used ever since. His column still became widely popular in Scotland and the rest of the world outside Ireland, where it is known as the \\"Coffey still\\" or \\"Patent Still\\". Early Coffey stills produced spirits of about 60% or somewhat higher alcohol by volume concentration but still offered its operators outstanding advantages; its fuel costs were low, its output high (2000 gallons a day of pure alcohol was a good average, it needed less maintenance and cleaning than pot stills and because the still was steam-heated, there was no risk whatsoever of scorching, saving labour costs and distillation down time. Modern versions of the Coffey still can achieve much higher alcohol concentrations, approaching 95.6% alcohol. As alcohol forms an azeotrope with water at this concentration, it is impossible to achieve higher purity alcohol by distillation alone. The Irish distilling industry generally did not take up the Coffey still, but big urban distilleries in Scotland took it on for scotch, and in England it was taken on by the gin distilleries. Distiller On his retirement from service, Aeneas Coffey went into the Irish distilling business. For a short time he ran the Dodder Bank Distillery, Dublin and Dock Distillery in Grand Canal Street, Dublin, before setting up on his own as Aeneas Coffey Whiskey Company in 1830. The development of the Coffey still made distillation of his own whiskey much more economical. Later years Nothing is known of the final years and last resting place of Aeneas Coffey. His eldest son, also called Aeneas Coffey, emigrated to South Africa and managed a distillery. Aeneas Coffey junior married but his wife died childless. He returned to England and spent his final years near London. Legacy Aeneas Coffey's invention changed the history of distilling. Automatisation of the distilling process enabled by him has been likened to the application of automatisation by Henry Ford in the automotive industry. Mechanisation of alcohol production using his methods can now be found in almost every country on earth.

Serviss was born in Sharon Springs, New York and majored in science at Cornell University. He took a law degree at Columbia University but never worked as an attorney. Instead, in 1876 he joined the staff of The New York Sun newspaper, working as a journalist until 1892 under editor Charles Dana. Serviss showed a talent for explaining scientific details in a way that made them clear to the ordinary reader, leading Andrew Carnegie to invite him to deliver The Urania Lectures in 1894 on astronomy, cosmology, geology, and related matters. With Carnegie's financial backing, these lectures were illustrated with magic lantern slides and other effects to show eclipses, presumed lunar landscapes, and much else. Serviss toured the United States for over two years delivering these lectures, then settled down to become a popular speaker in the New York area. He also wrote a syndicated newspaper column devoted to astronomy and other sciences and wrote frequently for the leading magazines of the day. Serviss' favorite topic was astronomy, and of the fifteen books he wrote, eight are devoted to it. He unquestionably was more widely read by the public on that topic than anyone prior to his time. He worked with Max and Dave Fleischer on The Einstein Theory of Relativity (1923), a short silent film released in connection with one of Serviss' books. He also wrote six works of fiction in his lifetime, all of which would today be classified as science fiction. Five of these were novels, and one was a short story.A. Langley Searles, \\"Introduction to the 1947 edition of Edison's Conquest of Mars\\", available online at Project Gutenberg. In his private life, Serviss was an enthusiastic mountain climber. He described his reaching the summit of the Matterhorn at the age of 43 as part of an effort \\"to get as far away from terrestrial gravity as possible.\\"As quoted by A. Langley Searles, \\"Preface\\" to the 1974 edition of A Columbus of Space. His son was the Olympic high jumper Garrett Serviss.

It also made a few motorcycles between 1921 and 1922 and cyclecars during the 1920s. Background Louis Bl√©riot was an engineer who had developed the first practical headlamp for cars and had established a successful business marketing them. In 1901 he had built a small unmanned ornithopter, but his serious involvement with aviation began in April 1905 when he witnessed Gabriel Voisin's first experiments with a floatplane glider towed behind a motorboat on the river Seine. A brief partnership with Voisin followed, but after the failure of the Bl√©riot III and its modified version, the Bl√©riot IV, the partnership was dissolved and Bl√©riot set up his own company, \\"Recherches A√©ronautique Louis Bl√©riot\\" (Louis Bl√©riot Aeronautical Research). Bl√©riot's early experiments File:Bleriot V.jpgBl√©riot V File:Bleriot VI.jpgBl√©riot VI File:Bleriot VII.jpgBl√©riot VII File:Bleriot VIII.jpgBl√©riot VIII File:Bleriot.jpgBl√©riot XI as first built Unlike the business started by Gabriel Voisin, which was a straightforward design and manufacturing concern with Voisin acting as aircraft designer, Bleriot's establishment was, as its name suggests, essentially a privately funded research establishment, employing various engineers and designers.Elliott 2000 p.50 Owing to this it is difficult to establish the extent of Bl√©riot's involvement in the actual design of the aircraft which bear his name. Over the next few years a series of aircraft of varying configurations were produced, each one marginally more successful than its predecessor, and culminating in the Type XI with which he became famous for being the first to fly across the English Channel in 1909. Commercial success Gnome engined production Bl√©riot XI Aircraft design and manufacturing The publicity gained by this achievement brought the company orders for large numbers of the Type XI, and several hundred were eventually made. This commercial success enabled the research side of the business to expand considerably, and in the years before the First World War a startlingly heterogeneous collection of aircraft were produced, although none came close to being as successful as the Type XI. Flying schools In late 1909 Bl√©riot established a flying training school for pilots at Etampes near Rouen, and early the next year a second school was opened at Pau, Between 1910 and 1914 these schools trained around 1,000 pilots: nearly half of the pilots holding an Aero Club de France brevet at the outbreak of the First World War had been trained by the Bl√©riot schools.Elliott 2000 p. 173 In September 1910 another flying school was opened at the newly established Hendon aerodrome near London. In July 1914 Bleriot opened another flying school at Brooklands in Surrey and also a small factory there, which was managed by Norbert Chereau and produced about 20 Bleriot Monoplane Trainers. SPAD In 1913 Bl√©riot acquired the assets of the Deperdussin company, following the arrest on fraud charges of its founder Armand Deperdussin. The name of the company was changed from Soci√©t√© de Production des A√©roplanes Deperdussin to Soci√©t√© Pour L'Aviation et ses D√©riv√©s, generally referred to by its acronym SPAD. This company became extremely successful during World War I with its mass production in French factories and worldwide exports. Production licenses were sold in several countries, including a larger British factory that was established near Brooklands at Addlestone, Surrey by 1917, and a production line at the Curtiss Elmwood plant (Buffalo, NY) in August 1917. 1914-18 During the First World War Bl√©riot A√©ronautique was largely concerned with manufacturing aircraft designed by others. The only aircraft produced under the Bl√©riot name was a series of prototype multi-engined heavy bombers, none of which entered service. After World War One The Allied victory in 1918 resulted in difficult times for the aircraft industry. During the war a large manufacturing capability had been built up, but the end of the war resulted in the disappearance of the market for military aircraft, and commercial aviation was as yet undeveloped. Bleriot liquidated SPAD, selling its factories and bringing key workers, including the head of design Andr√© Herbemont, to the Bl√©riot works at Suresnes. On 6 April 1919 Bl√©riot, in association with other leading French aircraft manufacturers, established the Compagnie des Messageries A√©riennes (CMA), and a prototype 28-seat airliner, the Type 75 Mammoth, based on the earlier Type 74 bomber, was exhibited at the Aero Salon in Paris in December 1919, along with three SPAD designs, the S.27, S.29 and S.30. The Type 75 proved unsuccessful, but 10 examples of the S.27 were ordered by CMA, and a five-seat development, the S.33 was produced, first flying at the end of 1920.Elliott 2000, p.219 This was followed by the larger S.46. Attempts were made to diversify: a contract to build fishing boats was accepted, and another for a motorcycle which was produced at Suresnes. At the 15th Paris Motor Show, in October 1919, the company was promoting a motorcycle then in 1921 a stylish little cyclecar with a 2-cylinder 750cc two-stroke engine and shaft drive. The French Bl√©riot cyclecars are sometimes confused with the Bl√©riot-Whippet chain-driven cycle cars made at the Bl√©riot-owned factory in Addlestone, England, but in fact the two vehicles had \\"little save size in common\\". In 1922 Bl√©riot A√©ronautique, which had been a private company became a limited-liability company, Bl√©riot A√©ronautique S.A..Elliott 2000, p.220 Although a single company, aircraft were produced using both the Bl√©riot and SPAD names, the former generally being used for the larger multi- engined aircraft, while the smaller single-engined aircraft bore the SPAD name, and it was these that were most successful. The only aircraft produced under the Bl√©riot name to be produced in any quantity was the Type 127, initially designed in 1925 as the Type 117 escort fighter, and later adapted to become a bomber. 42 examples were bought by the French air force. The last aircraft built under the Bl√©riot name was a large flying boat designed in response to a French Air Ministry requirement for an aircraft for a transatlantic mail service between Dakar and Natal in Brazil. The resulting aircraft, the Bl√©riot 5190 first flew in August 1933, and this prototype, named the Santos-Dumont proved highly successful, and a number of passenger carrying variants were planned. In May 1935, after it had completed its twelfth Atlantic crossing, the French government ordered three more examples, only to cancel the order six weeks later.Elliott 2000, p.237 In October 1936 the French government provided capital incentive to boost military aircraft production, bought and merged several manufacturers, including Bl√©riot A√©ronautique into SNCASO (now Airbus).

The grave contained the confirmed remains of 15 young women and girls, aged between 13 and 25, and an estimated total of up to 30, who were killed by a gang of pimps between 2002 and 2005. Discovery The mass grave was discovered by a dog near the village of Levinkha, Sverdlovsk Oblast, located south of the city of Nizhny Tagil, around early 2007. The first press report about the mass grave appeared in the Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda on February 2, 2007, written by its Urals correspondent Rinat Nizamov. On the same day, the Prosecutor's Office of Sverdlovsk Oblast issued an official statement confirming this information. Investigation According to police investigations of the mass grave, the murders of the girls were committed between 2002 and 2005 in the city of Nizhny Tagil, the towns of Kirovgrad and Kushva, and the districts of Nevyansky District and Prigorodny District, all in Sverdlovsk Oblast. Police arrested a gang of eight men, aged 25 to 46, accused of having abducted numerous local girls beginning in 2002, who were then raped, beaten, and under the threat of death forced to work as prostitutes in a brothel disguised as a massage parlor. Some of the girls were forced to write reassuring letters to their families. It was alleged that one of the murdered girls, Elena Chudinova, was the 14-year-old daughter of one of the gang leaders, Eduard \\"Edik\\" Chudinov.Over four years Urals gang killed 30 women taken for a 'picnic', The Observer, 11 February 2007Russia's Sex Slave Graveyard - Over the Urals and through the woods to the mother of all Russian crime stories, The eXile, February 6, 2008 Local police were accused of not having properly investigated the missing person reports, as from 2005 to 2006 there were 462 unsolved missing person cases in Nizhny Tagil alone, a city of about 400,000 inhabitants.Mass Indifference, The eXile, 8 February 2007 Convictions Prosecutors connected 14 of the murders with the gang, but sources close to the investigation suspected there were up to 50 victims.

Degrassi Community School Degrassi Community School is a fictional high school in Degrassi: The Next Generation and the titular academy primarily associated with it. It consists of students from grade 7 through grade 12 and its student body is made up of many cultures and backgrounds, paralleling and reflecting the multiculturalism associated with Toronto. The school originally was a junior high, housing grades 7‚Äì8. In season two, the school took on high school students after the neighboring high school shut down (mainly so that the characters could all attend the same school) and housed grades 7‚Äì12 for four years before dropping grades 7-8 and becoming a high school. However, this is not a real school; the set is a warehouse sized studio made to look like one at Epitome's studios. After season 4, there have been no characters on the show, minor or major, in grades 7 or 8. In season 10 a school uniform is instituted, the shirts are colour- coded by grade. This is dropped in season 12. =History= Founded in 1986 as Degrassi Junior High School, the facility is believed to be the same facility used in Degrassi Junior High and Degrassi High. In 1989, it combined with a high school, and became Degrassi High. The school was remodeled and renamed to \\"Degrassi Community School\\" for the school year starting in September 2001, and played host to the 1991 Ten Year High School Reunion shortly thereafter. The school's first nighttime dance was held in 2001, named \\"Starlight, Starbright\\". At the start of season 7, Degrassi Community School merged with rival school, Lakehurst Highschool, causing much friction between both schools, much of which had to do with the recent death of Degrassi student J.T. Yorke. The rivalry resulted in many fights and hatred between the students. =AcademicsMedia Immersion Program One of the most distinctive programs featured in the Degrassi Community School, is its Media Immersion Program (taught by Mr. Simpson up to season 9, and held in the computer lab). The program features high speed computers with internet access (via ADSL as of 2001)Mr. Raditch: \\"and the jewel of the Degrassi crown, the Media Immersion Lab. Every computer here is connected to the internet via high speed telephone access\\" and other educational programs. It also features the most up to date media software programs, all part of the new renovation planned by Mr. Raditch, \\"proudly bringing Degrassi to the 21st Century\\".Terri: \\"The Media Immersion Program is very unique to our school. We have over fifty high speed computers with internet access and other educational programs\\" .../Terri: \\"this is all part of the new renovations planned by Mr. Raditch\\" The computer lab uses a network, notably using a system called \\"D-Mail\\", where students may instant message each other, and send e-mails. Eighteen new computers were provided by the television program NaK, News About Kids, in exchange for showing their morning broadcasts. Though biased and a source for propaganda which also promotes certain commercial products, the NaK broadcasts were consented to be shown by a vote of parents of the Degrassi students.Emma: \\"NaK is totally bias.\\" .../Mr. Raditch: \\"Have you seen the new computers in the Media Immersion Lab? Eighteen new computers thanks to NaK. In exchange, we show their morning broadcast. .../Mr. Raditch: \\"the parents voted for it\\" =Faculty= * Principal Daniel Raditch, (Former) Principal and literature teacher in the Degrassi Junior High and Degrassi High series' * Principal Daphne Hatzilakos, (Former) Principal, science teacher and gym/school coach * Principal Sheppard, (Former) Principal and football coach * Principal Archie Simpson, Current Principal, and former media immersion teacher * Principal Deidre Pill, (Former) Acting Principal * Mr. Armstrong, Gym/school coach and math teacher * Ms. Badger, Science teacher * Mrs. Bollinger, (Former) media immersion assistant * Ms. Dawes, (Former) Art, drama, English teacher * Mr. Ellis, (Former) Chemistry and science teacher * Mrs. Lin, Mandarin teacher * Ms. Grell, Digital Arts, career studies, and rubber room teacher * Mr. Mitchell, Current English and Economics teacher * Mrs. Kwan, (Former) English and drama teacher * Ms. Oh., (Former) Media immersion teacher * Mr. Dom Perino, History teacher * Ms. Chantel Sauve, School guidance counselor * Sheila, (Former) lunch lady * Mrs. Smith, Secretary * Mr. Odie, (Former) History teacher * Mrs. Jasmia Toomer, (Former) web mastering =Layout= Completely renovated and changed by 2001, the Degrassi Community School features untraditional design schemes using new materials. Named a Community School, Degrassi does not follow the typical public school layout but closer to being identified as an alternative school. By 2002, the school had yet again been completely changed and reinvented as it underwent a merge to become both a Junior High School and High School. There are multiple unique aspects of the Degrassi school. In the spacious front lobby, a mural outlooks the front steps, one later redrawn by Jimmy Brooks. Written primarily at the top of the walls above the locker/hallway areas, there are a number of inspirational quotes employed. The main foyer is host to Degrassi's own motto, written larger and bolder than the other quotes. After J.T. dies in season six, a memorial garden at the school is built in his name. The school was once again renovated sometime during the summer of 2015. The school interior received a new paint job while the lockers were painted to feature a more retro look. All wooden classroom doors were also replaced with new grey doors. Several classrooms are also now equipped with smart-boards and HD television sets for a more digital learning environment. Also included in the redesign were new desks. New areas in the school include a lounge room for students, several sitting areas with cushioned chairs laid around the school, and a renovated classroom for a new course titled Digital Arts. The actual set for where the school scenes are shot in is a warehouse sized studio at Epitome Pictures. Outfitted to look like an actual school, the set features perhaps the most intricate and detailed designs, including numerous fliers, bulletins, and posters pertaining to the fictional Degrassi Community School. The studio is also used for filming the other sets, such as character's bedrooms, in the series.Epitome Virtual Reality Inc., \\"Degrassi Fan Pages FAQ \\", Degrassi.tv. Subheading: Where/ how is Degrassi filmed?, \\"The show is mainly filmed in the Epitome Pictures studios, a former warehouse that has been converted to look like a real school. The studio also houses the interiors of some of the characters' homes, and a mall food-court area. As a result, the majority of Degrassi is filmed inside one large studio. However, we do occasionally take the production \\"on location\\" to various places around Toronto that are impossible to re-create in a studio.\\" =Extracurricular activities= ; Basketball : Mr. Armstrong (season 1-present, coach), Jimmy Brooks (seasons 1‚Äì7, captain; seasons 6‚Äì7, assistant coach), Spinner Mason (seasons 1, 3, team manager), Sean Cameron, Derek Haig, K.C.

The Binghamton Fire Department is the fire department providing fire protection and emergency medical services to the city of Binghamton, New York.  History Binghamton's fire department first began in 1834 as a volunteer organization. On May 3 of 1834 the trustees of the Binghamton voted to organize specific engine and ladder. It wasn't until 2 years later in June 1836 that the village was able to purchase their first actual piece of firefighting equipment, a small hand powered fire engine. The Village of Binghamton was incorporated to City status by the New York State Legislature in 1867. The department became known as the Fire Department of the City of Binghamton on April 23, 1869. The first motorized apparatus, a Cadillac for the Chief of Department, was purchased in 1910. In the 1950s the population began shifting to the more rural areas of the county. Although the county population was shrinking, the scope of its operation was expanding. In September 1981 the ambulance was transferred from the Police Bureau to the Fire Bureau. In addition to providing ambulance service, a \\"First Responder\\" program was initiated. To meet the growing needs of the City, a Hazardous Material Response Team began operating in May 1988. In 1996 the EMS program was upgraded to provide ALS level of service. Overview The Binghamton Fire Department has a staff of 124 paid uniform fire-fighters and 3 civilian employees. The Department operates out of 5 fire stations, including the fire headquarters which serves as station 5. Stations & Apparatus { class=wikitable style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! ! Address !

Prior to the murders Prior to his murder conviction, Stanko had been incarcerated for assault and kidnapping in 1996. Stanko was released from prison in 2004 after serving 8 years of the 10-year sentence. While in prison, he co-authored Living in Prison: A History of the Correctional System With an Insider's View. (The book was written during his first incarceration.) Stanko has been described as \\"a highly intelligent, polished ex-convict who didn't mind talking about his life in prison or the book he'd written about it.\\" The book is about prison life and Stanko's fear of being labeled \\"a convicted felon\\" after his release. Stanko wrote: \\"What I fear most now is that I may carry some of this total institution back into society with me.\\" After his release in 2004 Stanko moved to Myrtle Beach, renting a room in the home of a Socastee widow for almost a year. His parole officer visited the home to ensure that his landlady was aware of his background, which he had disclosed when applying for the rental. His relationship with his landlady was uneventful other than his occasionally being late with the rent. He often complained about his difficulty in getting a job because of his background, although he did have one or two brief employments. He abruptly moved out after almost a year, moving to the home of a friend in exchange for keeping an eye on her elderly mother. The murders About one year after being released from prison, Stanko began doing library research, supposedly for a second book. While doing this research he befriended librarian Laura Ling, and eventually moved in with her as her boyfriend. He also had developed a seemingly friendly relationship with a library patron, Henry Turner. In April 2005, Stanko strangled Laura Ling (43), shot Henry Lee Turner (74) dead, and sexually assaulted and slit the throat of Ling's teen-aged daughter, who survived and made the 911 call for help. He was convicted of these charges after trials in which an insanity defense was used. The Ling trial was held in 2006, and the Turner trial in 2009. Following the convictions, he was sentenced to death in both cases. Articles on Jeffrey Dahmer, Green River killer Gary Ridgway and other serial killers were found in Stanko's home. According to a police spokesperson: \\"He either was just interested in serial killers or he was becoming a serial killer.\\" After a nationwide manhunt,America's Most Wanted based on tips received after the posting of a $10,000 reward for information leading to his capture,America's Most Wanted Stanko was arrested without incident by the U.S. Marshals Service in Augusta, Georgia on April 12, 2005. Awaiting execution Stephen Stanko is currently on death row at Kirkland Correctional Institution in Columbia, South Carolina. If the execution does take place, he will have a choice of the electric chair or lethal injection. He is the first person to be sentenced to death in Georgetown County in nearly 11 years.Georgetown Times The first phase of Stanko's appeals process began on September 23, 2007, when he appeared before the S.C. Supreme Court in a bid to overturn his death penalty conviction in the Laura Ling case. His attorney said that errors in the original trial resulted in his conviction, in that the trial judge did not allow the defense to ask potential jurors how they felt about the insanity defense and did not allow the defense to present Stanko's age/mentality as aggravating or mitigating factors. However, the conviction and sentence were affirmed. In February 2013, Stanko lost his appeal in the Henry Turner murder case; the Supreme Court affirmed Stanko's conviction and sentence. In 2015, there was a post-conviction relief (PCR) hearing. The court heard testimony from Bill Diggs, Stanko's trial attorney, that Stanko suffered from a brain defect. On May 24, 2016, the court reaffirmed his conviction.

The Birkeland‚ÄìEyde process was one of the competing industrial processes in the beginning of nitrogen based fertilizer production. It was developed by Norwegian industrialist and scientist Kristian Birkeland along with his business partner Sam Eyde in 1903, based on a method used by Henry Cavendish in 1784. This process was used to fix atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into nitric acid (HNO3), one of several chemical processes generally referred to as nitrogen fixation. The resultant nitric acid was then used as a source of nitrate (NO3‚àí) in the reaction :HNO3 + H2O -> H3O+ + NO3- which may take place in the presence of water or another proton acceptor. A factory based on the process was built in Rjukan and Notodden in Norway, combined with the building of large hydroelectric power facilities. The Birkeland‚ÄìEyde process is relatively inefficient in terms of energy consumption. Therefore, in the 1910s and 1920s, it was gradually replaced in Norway by a combination of the Haber process and the Ostwald process. The Haber process produces ammonia (NH3) from molecular nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen (H2), the latter usually but not necessarily produced by steam reforming methane (CH4) gas in current practice. The ammonia from the Haber process is then converted into nitric acid (HNO3) in the Ostwald process. The process Diagram of the production of a plasma disc using water-cooled electrodes and an electromagnet One type of reactor used at Rjukan from 1912 to 1940 now located in a park in Rjukan. Reactor Building II behind the S√•heim Hydroelectric Power Station in which 35 Birkeland-Eyde reactors were installed requiring 3000 kW each An electrical arc was formed between two coaxial water- cooled copper tube electrodes powered by a high voltage alternating current of 5 kV at 50 Hz. A strong static magnetic field generated by a nearby electromagnet spreads the arc into a thin disc by the Lorentz force. This setup is based on an experiment by Julius Pl√ºcker who in 1861 showed how to create a disc of sparks by placing the ends of a U-shaped electromagnet around a spark gap so that the gap between them was perpendicular to the gap between the electrodes, and which was later replicated similarly by Walther Nernst and others. The plasma temperature in the disc was in excess of 3000 ¬∞C. Air was blown through this arc, causing some of the nitrogen to react with oxygen forming nitric oxide. By carefully controlling the energy of the arc and the velocity of the air stream, yields of up to approximately 4-5% nitric oxide were obtained at 3000 ¬∞C and less at lower temperatures. The process is extremely energy intensive. Birkeland used a nearby hydroelectric power station for the electricity as this process demanded about 15 MWh per ton of nitric acid, yielding approximately 60 g per kWh. The same reaction is carried out by lightning, providing a natural source for converting atmospheric nitrogen to soluble nitrates. :N2 + O2 -> 2NO The hot nitric oxide is cooled and combines with atmospheric oxygen to produce nitrogen dioxide. The time this process takes depends on the concentration of NO in the air. At 1% it takes about 180 seconds and at 6% about 40 seconds to achieve 90% conversion. :2 NO + O2 -> 2 NO2 This nitrogen dioxide is then dissolved in water to give rise to nitric acid, which is then purified and concentrated by fractional distillation. :3 NO2 + H2O -> 2 HNO3 + NO The design of the absorption process was critical to the efficiency of the whole system. The nitrogen dioxide was absorbed into water in a series of packed column or plate column absorption towers each four stories tall to produce approximately 40-50% nitric acid. The first towers bubbled the nitrogen dioxide through water and non-reactive quartz fragments. Once the first tower reached final concentration, the nitric acid was moved to a granite storage container, and liquid from the next water tower replaced it. That movement process continued to the last water tower which was replenished with fresh water. About 20% of the produced oxides of nitrogen remained unreacted so the final towers contained an alkaline solution of lime to convert the remaining to calcium nitrate (also known as Norwegian saltpeter) except approximately 2% which were released into the air.

Wyeth is remembered for work with the saxophonist James Moody, the rockabilly singer Robert Gordon, the electric guitarist Link Wray, the rhythm and blues singer Don Covay, and the folk singer Christine Lavin. Best known as a drummer for Bob Dylan, he was a member of the Wyeth family of American artists. Family N. C. Wyeth (1882-1945), Wyeth's grandfather Wyeth was born in Jersey City, New Jersey. His mother Caroline Pyle, Howard Pyle‚Äôs niece, was interested in the Wyeth family, flirted with some of them, and married Nathaniel C. Wyeth. He had four brothers, John, David, N. Convers, and Andrew, and one sister, Melinda who died very young. A fifth brother (the oldest), Newell died with his grandfather in 1945 when their car stalled on a railroad crossing near their home and they were struck by a milk train. Wyeth married once, to Rona Morrow, and later divorced. Catherine Wheeler was his partner for seventeen years, from his mid-thirties on. The Wyeths are a family of visual artists and, earlier, illustrators who lived and worked together in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania. Including the Hurds and the McCoys, at least eleven artists are among the family and in-laws. Wyeth was the namesake of his great-uncle Howard Pyle (1853-1911), the artist and illustrator for Harper's Weekly and the author of The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood and four volumes of children's stories about King Arthur. His grandfather N. C. Wyeth was a student of Howard Pyle and a prominent illustrator of children's books for Charles Scribner's Sons. His grandmother Ellen Bernard Thompson Pyle was an illustrator of children for The Saturday Evening Post who married Walter Pyle, Howard's younger brother. He was the nephew of the painters Andrew Wyeth, Henriette Wyeth and Carolyn Wyeth. Early years Wyeth was the son of music lovers-- his father enjoyed playing ragtime. He learned drums by age 4 and soon on a piano could repeat songs he had heard. He attended the Wilmington Friends School where his music teacher helped him decide to be a musician. Fats Waller was Wyeth's greatest influence, leading him to learn stride piano and music theory. He studied percussion with Alan Abel of the Philadelphia Orchestra, and received a bachelor's in music at Syracuse University in 1966. Wyeth played at various times in the bands the Dogs and the Worms after moving to New York City in 1969. In 1972 on a solo album by John Herald co-produced by Bob Neuwirth for Paramount, Wyeth played with Amos Garret, Steven Soles, Ned Albright and Rob Stoner. Desire The World of John Hammond, Chicago 1975 Stoner brought Wyeth to drum on Desire in July 1975, a decision that satisfied Dylan who said, \\"Your drummer sounds great, it sounds great.\\" The songs were co-written with Jacques Levy, and the personnel were Dylan (vocals, guitar, harmonica, piano), Vinnie Bell (bouzouki), Scarlet Rivera (violin), Dom Cortese (accordion), Stoner (bass, background vocals), Wyeth (drums), Luther Rix (congas), and Emmylou Harris, Ronee Blakley and Soles (background vocals). In September 1975, a few months before the album release in January, Dylan, with Rivera on violin, Stoner on bass and Wyeth on drums, performed Hurricane, Oh, Sister and Simple Twist of Fate for the PBS tribute to John Hammond recorded at the WTTW television studios in Chicago. The group found themselves with a Billboard No. 1 pop album, the last Dylan effort to reach that mark for thirty years until 2006 when he released Modern Times. Robert Christgau who distrusted the project thought the song \\"Joey\\" was \\"deceitful bathos,\\" and Dave Marsh called \\"Joey\\" \\"elitist sophistry\\" and \\"contemptible,\\" but Rolling Stone counted Desire the 174th greatest album of all time. Desire eventually reached RIAA multi-platinum, selling over two million copies before its re- release in 2003. The project is remembered for its \\"loose and swirling\\" sound and the songs \\"Hurricane\\", \\"Isis\\", \\"One More Cup of Coffee (Valley Below)\\", \\"Oh, Sister\\", \\"Black Diamond Bay\\" and \\"Sara\\". and Sony credited Wyeth as an accompanist with an \\"uncannily sympathetic ear.\\" Larry Sloman called his drumming \\"ethereal.\\" Billboard said Stoner and Wyeth were one of the strongest rhythm sections in music. Rolling Thunder Revue Dylan, Levy and Neuwirth conceived the Rolling Thunder Revue in New York in 1975. The revue toured the United States during the end of 1975 and first half of 1976, and at two of those shows recorded the live album Hard Rain released in 1976. They are the musical performers in the Hard Rain documentary by TVTV shown on NBC in 1976, and in the film Renaldo and Clara released in 1978. About one hundred people traveled including supporting personnel. The recording artists were Dylan and Joan Baez (vocal & guitar), Blakley (vocal), Gary Burke (drums), T-Bone Burnett (guitar), David Mansfield (steel-guitar, mandolin, violin, dobro), Roger McGuinn (guitar, vocal), Neuwirth (guitar, vocal), Rivera (violin), Rix (drums, percussion, congas), Mick Ronson (guitar), Soles (guitar, vocal), Stoner (bass) and Wyeth (piano, drums). and Joni Mitchell, who flew in to sing for one show, nearly left, but when she told Wyeth goodbye, he was hurt, \\"And I suddenly realized, more than anybody Wyeth's reaction was so heartfelt, his expression of it was so open. Like it's just his soul is so beautiful. And I stayed.\\" Isaac Hayes, Richie Havens, Carlos Santana, Ringo Starr, Stephen Stills and Stevie Wonder joined the band, who named themselves Guam, for a show in Houston. With bad acoustics and the Astrodome only half full it was a \\"monumental flop.\\" According to Wyeth the newcomers brought their own bands, \\"They weren't doing it the way we'd been doing it. We lost the whole togetherness thing.\\" In pouring rain, the Hard Rain recordings for television and most of the live album were made outdoors at Colorado State University's Hughes Stadium in 1976 at Fort Collins, Colorado. The show was \\"triumphant\\" and well received, one reviewer calling \\"Idiot Wind\\" the \\"most passionate and emotional live performance\\" Dylan had ever made. Stoner said, \\"everybody is playing and singing for their lives, and that is the spirit that you hear on that record.\\" Due to low ticket sales, the Rolling Thunder Revue ended two days later in Salt Lake, Wyeth's final concert with Dylan and this band. Later years McGuinn loved the tour and turned to the studio with Mansfield, Ronson, Stoner and Wyeth to record Cardiff Rose. Burke, Burnett, McGuinn, Ronson, Soles and Wyeth are among the cast of thirty five musicians who recorded Lasso from El Paso for Kinky Friedman who was a guest artist in the revue. Sony continues to release Dylan's music so the Rolling Thunder Revue artists are credited long after they disbanded. Their work is in Masterpieces (1978), The Bootleg Series Volumes 1-3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961-1991 (1991), Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Volume 3 (1994), Best of Bob Dylan (1997), Bob Dylan Live 1975 (The Bootleg Series Volume 5) (2002), and Desire (remastered 2003). Wyeth recorded four albums with Gordon, as well as albums with Don McLean, Leslie West and Moody. He is the drummer on Lavin's Attainable Love released by Philo in 1990 and the pianist on \\"Warmer Days\\", a song written by John Popper on the 1990 A&M; album Blues Traveler. Later he led his own groups on piano, playing ragtime, blues and early jazz. Chadds Ford Getaway was Wyeth's one solo recording of ragtime and stride piano. It was remastered by Greg Calbi at Sterling Sound and released as a two-CD set in 2003 by Stand Clear Music. Among the fifteen medleys are lesser-known works alongside \\"Ain't Misbehavin'\\", made famous by Fats Waller, and Scott Joplin's \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\". Mansfield and Wyeth played on Chris Harford's Elektra album Be Headed in 1992 with a host of others. After Wyeth's death, Harford released a piano instrumental Ode to Howie Wyeth. and Also that year, Wyeth played drums on Fishermen's Stew's 7\\" single release of \\"Small Life, Hollow Roads, and Fairy Tales\\" b/w \\"Fine\\" released on Berlin's Twang!

In the early 19th century, a reform housing colony for the poor and homeless was established in Veenhuizen. In the late 19th century, the complex was turned into a penal colony. The village became freely accessible in 1984 and has been part of the municipality of Noordenveld since 1998. The National Prison Museum is located here.  History = Origins  The history of Veenhuizen goes away back in to the late Middle Ages but only as an insignificant hamlet alongside a little stream called the \\"Slokkert\\". This was situated a little to the north of the current village.  Reform housing colony  Change came when the general Johannes van den Bosch started the Maatschappij van Weldadigheid (which translates into Society for Benevolence) in the 1820s. The company bought 30 km¬≤ of land to found colonies which would house and provide work for the poor from the large cities in the west of the Netherlands. Veenhuizen then became a reform housing colony for the poor and homeless from the large cities (like Amsterdam and The Hague). It was, together with a location Botany Bay in Australia, the only colony within a country's own borders. The change is still evident in the way the village was set up. The village is made up of roads in a grid pattern with blocks measuring 700 by 700 metres, in a style similar to that of American villages. The difference with the United States is that most of these blocks are still filled in with farmland on which the inmates used to work.  Penal colony  Nationaal Gevangenismuseum Later in the 19th century the Maatschappij van Weldadigheid went broke and the whole complex/village was taken over by the Department of Justice for use as a penal colony, of which \\"complex nr. 2\\" is in use today by the Nationaal Gevangenismuseum (National Prison Museum). The (staff) houses are concentrated around the now two remaining prison complexes. The other prison buildings that were added in 1900 are still in use today (albeit modernized several times since). The windows of the buildings have educational texts in large sculptured sills on the front, about two stories high to educate the people working in and around them. The texts used to correspond with the intended inhabitant. The headmaster's house said \\"knowledge is power\\", and the pharmacist's house said \\"bitter and sweet\\". Veenhuizen used to be closed off to everyone but the inmates and the staff and their families lived in housing (most now newly built in the 1970s, 80's and 90's) provided by the department. The village was treated as private companies grounds which also meant that the police had no jurisdiction there, meaning that moped- riding youth were thus exempt from traffic violations.  Village  Since 1984 the village is freely accessible for all and houses a tea-garden, a pub (for the very first time in its existence) as well as the national museum for correctional facilities.Het Gevangenismuseum (in Dutch) The village is, despite its size, known throughout the Netherlands. Even national celebrities have done time there for driving while under the influence of alcohol. It has even been honoured by its own rendition of Johnny Cash's \\"San Quentin\\" song, in Dutch. The whole village, including the museum and remnants of the original early 19th-century poorhouse-living project, was nominated to become a World Heritage site in 2011.  Geography  Veenhuizen was in the municipality (or gemeente) Norg before it was reorganized to be part of a larger collection of municipalities including the larger village of Roden to become the municipality of Noordenveld (since 1998). The larger cities in the area are Groningen, Assen (20 to 30 km), Amsterdam and Bremen, (Germany) (around 200 km). Veenhuizen has an altitude of about 7 metres.

Cockburn was later praised for his skill in the Latin language.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 86. He became Bishop of Ross in 1507, by which time he was holding the position of Chancellor of the diocese of Dunkeld.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, pp. 112, 269 He had received crown nomination to the bishopric on either March or May, and was provided to the see on 9 July.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 224; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 269 Cockburn was a chaplain to Louis XII of France and acted as a diplomat for James IV of Scotland. On 10 July 1507, Louis asked Cockburn to request 4,000 Scottish troops to assist in the defence of the French possession, the Duchy of Milan. In October James replied that he would send military support if warned in advance, and Cockburn was instructed to discuss another project. This was probably the Scottish king's plans for a crusade.

It was released by M√©li√®s's Star Film Company and is numbered 499‚Äì500 in its catalogues. Plot In a Renaissance chamber decorated with devilish faces and a warped coat of arms, a gleeful demon throws three human victims into a cauldron, which spews out flames. The victims rise from the cauldron as nebulous ghosts, and then turn into fireballs. The fireballs multiply and pursue the demon around the chamber. Finally the demon himself leaps into the infernal cauldron, which gives off a final burst of flame. Production M√©li√®s plays the demon, identified in the Star Film Company's American catalogue as Belphegor. The film's special effects were created with pyrotechnics, multiple exposures, soft focus, and substitution splices. Versions A hand-colored print of the film M√©li√®s's pre-1903 films, especially the popular A Trip to the Moon, were frequently pirated by American producers such as Siegmund Lubin. In order to combat the piracy, M√©li√®s opened an American branch of his Star Film Company and began producing two negatives of each film he made: one for domestic markets, and one for foreign release. To produce the two separate negatives, M√©li√®s built a special camera that used two lenses and two reels of film simultaneously. In the 2000s, researchers at the French film company Lobster Films noticed that M√©li√®s's two-lens system was in effect an unintentional, but fully functional, stereo film camera, and therefore that 3D versions of M√©li√®s films could be made simply by combining the domestic and foreign prints of the film.

In the early years of the event, WWE put on shows for troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, with performers and employees traveling to these countries and interacting with troops, as well as visiting military camps, bases and hospitals. In recent years, WWE has done the show in the U.S., promoting events at (and nearby) domestic military bases, as well as visiting sites such as Walter Reed Army Medical Center and Bethesda Naval Hospital.  History  JBL interacting with soldiers The idea of the event is credited to wrestler John \\"Bradshaw\\" Layfield, who suggested it to WWE Chairman Vince McMahon. WWE first held the event in December 2003, from Camp Victory in Baghdad, Iraq and aired it on Christmas Day as a special episode of WWE SmackDown. In the main event, John Cena defeated Big Show, and Stone Cold Steve Austin came out after the match, performed a Stunner on both men, and finally invited all the talent backstage to the ring to celebrate. For this Tribute to the Troops and all others until 2011, commentary was recorded at WWE headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut, as commentators were not at ringside. In December 2004, WWE traveled to COB Speicher in Tikrit, Iraq. The TV show, Christmas in Iraq, aired on December 23 as another special SmackDown episode. Eddie Guerrero and Rey Mysterio defeated Kurt Angle and Luther Reigns in the main event. Chris Jericho performs an enzuigiri on Randy Orton during the 2007 Tribute to the Troops On December 9, 2005, WWE held the event at the Bagram Airfield in Bagram, Afghanistan. It aired December 19 on WWE Raw. In the main event, Shawn Michaels beat Triple H in a Boot Camp match. In 2006, the show was taped at Camp Victory in Baghdad, aired on Raw on Christmas Day, and had Carlito pin Randy Orton in the main event. A day before taping, a mortar attack happened near the camp, injuring 14 soldiers. Michael Cole reported details from the scene minutes later. In 2007, WWE returned to Tikrit. D-Generation X members Triple H and Shawn Michaels defeated Umaga and Mr. Kennedy in the main event, which aired on Christmas Eve on WWE Raw. 2008's show from Camp Liberty, Baghdad was the first to air in a non-standard WWE timeslot, a one-hour December 20 special on NBC. In its main event, John Cena, Batista and Rey Mysterio defeated Chris Jericho, The Big Show and Randy Orton in a six-man tag team match. WWE again travelled to Iraq in 2009. In the main event from Joint Base Balad, John Cena retained his WWE Championship from Chris Jericho. It aired on December 19, 2009 on NBC. In 2010, WWE held its first domestically hosted Tribute to the Troops, from Fort Hood in Killeen, Texas on December 11. It aired on NBC December 18 for one hour, with a message from former president George W. Bush. A two-hour version of the show aired December 22 on USA Network. The 2019 edition marked the first time that the event would not be aired on television.  Awards and honors  WWE wrestlers during the 2003 Tribute to the Troops * In 2004, the United Service Organizations (USO) of Metropolitan Washington awarded WWE with the first-ever Legacy of Hope award \\"for its extensive support of our troops and the USO's Operation Care Package program\\". * In 2005, the Army and Air Force Exchange Service awarded WWE the first-ever Three-Commander Coin Award \\"for WWE's support of its partnership with AAFES to improve the quality of life for our troops by supporting service members and their families worldwide\\". * During the 2006 show, Director of Air Force Morale, Welfare and Recreation Art Myers presented WWE Chairman Vince McMahon with the Secretary of Defense Exceptional Public Service Award. McMahon immediately presented the award to John Bradshaw Layfield, who had the idea for the show. * In 2007, the WWE received the first Corporate Patriot Award at the annual GI Film Festival in Washington, D.C., \\"in recognition of its ongoing support and appreciation of the U.S. military and their families, particularly its annual holiday Tribute to the Troops tour to entertain troops in war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan\\". * In 2008, then President George W. Bush aired a message during the show, thanking WWE for giving US troops the gift of entertainment every Christmas. He did so again in 2010. * In 2011 and 2012, WWE aired messages from President Barack Obama during the broadcasts, expressing his gratitude for the Armed Forces for their service in Iraq and Afghanistan. * In 2015, the WWE themselves began presenting a custom WWE Championship belt to the servicemen and women who have helped in hosting the event and for their continued service to the country. The custom belt features side plates that commemorate the year's event. They have presented custom belts every year since.

It entered service with the German Army in the late 1950s. It was followed by the Cobra 2000 and Mamba missile systems, which were upgrades that improved the guidance system and performance of the missile. The missile had limited distribution in the United States by Daystrom Inc., a licensed U.S. distributor, chiefly for evaluation purposes (U.S. Marines were interested and evaluated the missile for purchase.) Description The Cobra has a cruciform arrangement of four large forward swept wings. The main body is a long cylinder, with an underslung launch booster. Each of the wings has a spoiler on the rear edge which is used to steer the missile. The warhead is at the front of the missile, behind which is the gyro and guidance circuitry which allows the missile to interpret steering instructions from the operator. Behind the guidance mechanism is the sustainer motor, around which is wrapped the guidance wire which plays out behind the missile. The missile is normally deployed with a single operator controlling and control box linked to up to eight missiles, which can be deployed up to twenty meters away from the operator. On launch the booster fires, projecting the missile up into the air at an angle of 20 degrees. The operator then steers the missile towards the target along his line of sight using a joystick on the control box. Development Development of the system began in 1954 as a collaboration between Contraves, Oerlikon and B√∂lkow. The initials of these companies and the German word for rocket (Rakete) gave the project its name: COBRA. The first successful tests were conducted in 1956, with the West German government placing an initial order for 2,000 missiles in January 1957. Production of the original missile ended in 1968, with a new version, the Cobra 2000 entering service. The Cobra 2000 extended the range of the missile to 2,000 meters and could be fitted with either an anti-tank warhead or a dual purpose anti-tank/fragmentation warhead. The Mamba was introduced in 1972 and improved the guidance system, and added a dual thrust motor with an initial low power launch mode, followed by a higher powered sustainer which allows the missile to be gathered more easily during the initial seconds of flight. Initial launch speed is just 35 meters per second, after the sustainer is engaged this increases to 140 meters per second. The missile travels faster, reducing the time of flight to its maximum range in just 17.5 seconds. Also the operator is provided with a x7 power telescope. Service history The weapon was widely used by NATO forces most notably West Germany and was exported to Argentina, Brazil, Chile (Mamba), Denmark, Greece, Israel, India, Turkey, Pakistan, Spain. Approximately 170,000 of the missiles were produced.

Vapour quality is an intensive property which can be used in conjunction with other independent intensive properties to specify the thermodynamic state of the working fluid of a thermodynamic system. It has no meaning for substances which are not saturated mixtures (for example, compressed liquids or superheated fluids). Vapor quality is an important quantity during the adiabatic expansion step in various thermodynamic cycles (like Organic Rankine cycle, Rankine cycle, etc.). Working fluids can be classified by using the appearance of droplets in the vapour during the expansion step. Quality \\\\chi can be calculated by dividing the mass of the vapour by the mass of the total mixture: :\\\\chi = \\\\frac{m_{vapour}}{m_{total}} where m indicates mass. Another definition used by chemical engineers defines quality (q) of a fluid as the fraction that is saturated liquid. By this definition, a saturated vapour has q = 0. A saturated liquid has q = 1.Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook (7th Edition), p 13-29 An alternative definition is the 'equilibrium thermodynamic quality'. It can be used only for single-component mixtures (e.g. water with steam), and can take values <0 (for sub-cooled fluids) and >1 (for super-saturated vapours): \\\\chi_{eq} = \\\\frac{h-h_{f}}{h_{fg}}; where h is the mixture specific enthalpy, defined as: h = \\\\frac{m_{f}.h_{f}+m_{g}.h_{g}}{m_{f}+m_{g}}. Subscripts f and g refer to saturated liquid and saturated gas respectively, and fg refers to vaporisation. Calculation The above expression for vapour quality can be expressed as: :\\\\chi = \\\\frac{y - y_f}{y_g - y_f} where y is equal to either specific enthalpy, specific entropy, specific volume or specific internal energy, y_f is the value of the specific property of saturated liquid state and y_{g}-y_{f} is the value of the specific property of the substance in dome zone, which we can find both liquid y_{f} and vapor y_{g}. Another expression of the same concept is: :\\\\chi=\\\\frac{m_v}{m_l + m_v} where m_v is the vapour mass and m_l is the liquid mass. Steam quality and work The origin of the idea of vapour quality was derived from the origins of thermodynamics, where an important application was the steam engine. Low quality steam would contain a high moisture percentage and therefore damage components more easily. High quality steam would not corrode the steam engine. Steam engines use water vapour (steam) to push pistons or turbines, and that movement creates work. The quantitatively described steam quality (steam dryness) is the proportion of saturated steam in a saturated water/steam mixture. In other words, a steam quality of 0 indicates 100% water while a steam quality of 1 (or 100%) indicates 100% steam. The quality of steam on which steam whistles are blown is variable and may affect frequency. Steam quality determines the velocity of sound, which declines with decreasing dryness due to the inertia of the liquid phase. Also, the specific volume of steam for a given temperature decreases with decreasing dryness.Soo, Shao L. (1989). Particulates and Continuum: A Multiphase Fluid Dynamics. CRC Press.Menon, E. Sashi. (2005). Piping Calculations Manual. New York: McGraw- Hill. Steam quality is very useful in determining enthalpy of saturated water/steam mixtures since the enthalpy of steam (gaseous state) is many orders of magnitude higher than enthalpy of water (liquid state).

He was the son of Ninlil and Enlil or, in alternative traditions, of Ereshkigal and Gugalana. His wife is oftentimes depicted as the goddess Ninigirida and their son was Ningiszida.Leick, G. (1998). A dictionary of ancient Near Eastern mythology. London: Routledge. Ninazu was the patron deity of the city of Eshnunna and Enegi until the God Tispak superseded him in popularity and became the new patron deity of Eshnunna.  Genealogy and Mythology  Ereshkigal and Gugalana were considered Ninazu's mother and father in Enegi; however, it is believed by scholars that Nergal was actually his father due to the Sumerian Story of ‚ÄúEreshkigal and Nergal‚Äù where he rapes and impregnates her; however, this may be in reference to one of her many other children. It was primarily in Enshnunna that his parentage was referenced as Ninlil and Enlil.There are many interpretations on his parentage; however, it seems that Ereshkigal and Gulgana are the most widely accepted by scholars. Ninazu was the patron deity of Eshnunna and Enegi, in Eshnunna he was depicted as warlike and it was his dual genealogy that identified his ties to the underworld. This dual genealogy shows he is a dying and returning god, which is what links him to vegetation and agriculture. In the story How Grain Came to Sumer, he and his brother are depicted bringing barley and flax to the people and in the story Enlil and Ninlil he is referred to as ‚Äòthe lord who stretches the measuring line over the fields‚Äô. In Enegi he is considered the steward of the underworld and is strongly correlated to imagery of a snake. Although in some traditions he is depicted as having some involvement with healing, due to his name being interpreted as ‚ÄòLord Healer‚Äô, this is not his primary attribute. It is only in second and third millennium incantations that he is called upon for healing and that is most often for snake bites, due to title of ‚ÄúKing of the snakes‚Äù.  Worship  Due to his association as the steward of the underworld in Enegi, Ninazu is of central focus in a festival that is held to mourn chthonic gods. During this festival that occurs on the sixth month, the people of Enegi make offerings to kings and priestesses who have passed. The Sumerian lamentation on which this festival is based upon (In the Desert in the Early Grass) he is deemed ‚ÄúKing of the snakes‚Äù. He also receives offerings in Lagash, Umma and Nippur. One may find temples dedicated to him in both Enegi and Enshnunna, they were typically ‚Äòstorehouses‚Äô and ‚ÄòPure Houses‚Äô. Ninazu's following fell upon the rise in popularity of the gods Tispak and Nergal.  Sources  * Walls, N. H. (2001). Desire, discord and death: Approaches to ancient Near Eastern myth.

He published the first German textbook of nephrology, and performed microscopic research of Bright's disease. He was the first to identify the three primary stages of Bright's disease and how the condition leads to fibrosis and atrophy. Frerichs gave the first clinical description of progressive familial hepatolenticular degeneration (now known as Wilson's disease), and also discovered the presence of leucine and tyrosine in urine involving yellow atrophy of the liver. He also described the anatomical changes that place in liver cirrhosis and malaria perniciosa.

Career Shane Lacy Hensley was from Clintwood, Virginia, and began playing Dungeons & Dragons after he discovered the game through a series of comic-strip ads that were running in comic books in the 1980s. Hensley later sent West End Games an unsolicited Torg adventure he had written, which was soon published as The Temple of Rec Stalek (1992). Hensley did more work for FASA, TSR, and West End over the next few years. Hensley created the game company Pinnacle Entertainment Group in 1994. Hensley wanted to create a 19th-century miniatures game and contacted local company Chameleon Eclectic about publishing it, which resulted in Fields of Honor (1994); ownership of the game remained with Pinnacle, but it was published in conjunction with Chameleon Eclectic. Hensley had the idea for a new game centering on cowboys and zombies as he was setting Pinnacle up, when he saw the Brom painting of a Confederate vampire on the cover of White Wolf's then-unreleased Necropolis: Atlanta; he thus began writing what would eventually become Deadlands. After completing a first draft, Henlsey flew in two friends and game designers, Greg Gorden and Matt Forbeck; both liked what they saw and asked to buy into Pinnacle, although Gorden soon left for personal reasons. Hensley did some computer game design work for SSI. Forbeck left Pinnacle a few years later, leaving Hensley as the sole owner. On September 13, 2000, it was announced that Pinnacle had been sold to a company called Cybergames.com. Cybergames used acquisitions' income to buy other companies ‚Äì harming the individual companies' cashflow and ruining production schedules ‚Äì and Hensley announced on January 12, 2001 that the acquisition had been \\"undone\\", but not before considerable damage had been done to Pinnacle, leaving it with just a few employees. Hensley became part of the new d20 boom, kicking off a new d20-based weird war campaign with Blood on the Rhine (2001). In 2003, Hensley formed a new company, Great White Games and transferred all of Pinnacle's IP to it, as well as publishing the new game Savage Worlds (2003). Hensley joined Cryptic Studios in 2004. With senior developer David \\"Zeb\\" Cook, Hensley was the senior writer on City of Villains (2005). Hensley designed the role-playing game Army of Darkness (2005) for Eden Studios. Hensley also worked with Superstition Studios, which was working on a Deadlands MMORPG that never appeared. Hensley headed Dust Devil Studios where he brought Zombie Pirates (2010) to market. He later returned to Cryptic Studios and became Executive Producer. Hensley has written several novels and designed a variety of games including miniatures wargames, tabletop wargames, and role-playing games, as well as substantial freelance work writing modules for game systems. He has also scripted at least one computer game. Hensley has been a Guest of Honor at a number of major conventions and has garnered several game industry honors and awards. He left Cryptic to make a Deadlands MMO in 2007, but the parent company went bankrupt. Hensley briefly returned to Cryptic in 2010 as Executive Producer on Neverwinter, then on to Petroglyph Games to work on the End of Nations MMORTS (published by Trion Worlds).

Sweden is historically part of the vodka belt, with high consumption of distilled drinks and binge drinking, but during the later half of the 20th century, habits are more harmonized with western Europe, with increasing popularity of wine and weekday drinking. Wine is now also grown and produced in several parts of Sweden and the southernmost region of Sk√•ne is turning into a hub experiencing a strong growth in number of active vineyards. Drinks and brands Caloric punsch advertistement circa 1885 The main Swedish specialty is br√§nnvin (literally \\"burn-wine\\"), liquor distilled from fermented grain or potatoes. Vodka is the highest grade of br√§nnvin, with brands like Absolut Vodka and Explorer Vodka. Br√§nnvin seasoned with herbs is known as akvavit. This is usually drunk as a snaps, also known as nubbe, a small shot glass to a traditional meal (especially pickled herring or crayfish). Swedish punsch is also a spirit of particular historical significance in Sweden. Lager beer is the most popular beer, both with meals and in bars. In restaurants and bars it is usually served as a stor stark (literally \\"large strong\\"), a glass usually containing 40 - 50 cL of stark√∂l (see below). L√§tt√∂l (generally around 2% abv) is very popular in lunch restaurants as for the vast majority of people it is possible to drink one serving of it and still stay below the legal limits for drink driving. Sweet cider is also common. As of July 1, 2005, new rules established that only fermented juice from apple or pear is allowed to be called 'cider'. Before this change, any fruit-based drink could be called cider, meaning that what would be considered alcopop in other countries could be sold as cider in Sweden. History Sweden is traditionally part of the vodka belt. Since the Middle Ages, beer was the staple drink in Sweden. Mead was a common delicacy. Distilling was introduced in the 15th century. Prohibition against production and/or sale of br√§nnvin‚Äîdistilled alcohol‚Äîhas been enforced during some periods. As Sweden was industrialized and urbanized during the 19th century, industrially produced br√§nnvin became more available, and alcohol caused increasing health and social problems. The temperance movement rose, and since 1905, government has had a monopoly on sales of liquor. The Swedish prohibition referendum in 1922 resulted in continued sales of alcohol. A rationing system, called Brattsystemet or motbok, was used until 1955. As Sweden entered the EU in 1995, drinking habits became more continental, and regulations were relaxed. Systembolaget introduced box wine and law allowed private enterprises to produce, import and market alcohol, and sell directly to restaurants‚Äîthough the retail monopoly remained. Consumption of alcohol increased by 30% from 1995 to 2005. Regulation and taxation Systembolaget store. Sweden has a government alcohol monopoly called Systembolaget for sale of all alcoholic drinks stronger than 3.5% by volume. The minimum purchase age at Systembolaget is 20 years, but 18 at licensed restaurants and bars. Beer is legally divided into three classes. Class I (maximum 2.25%), called l√§tt√∂l (\\"light beer\\"), is sold without restrictions (although shops often set their own age restrictions). Class II (up to 3.5%), called folk√∂l (\\"people's beer\\"), is sold in regular stores, but with the minimum purchase age of 18. Class III, stark√∂l (\\"strong beer\\", over 3.5%) is sold only in Systembolaget stores. Drinks are taxed by content of alcohol, more heavily than in most other countries. As of 2007, the tax on vodka (40%) is 200.56 SEK/liter, on wine (14%) at 22.08 SEK/liter, and on beer (4.5%) 6.615 SEK/liter. Beer with 2.8% alcohol or less is exempt from tax, except VAT.Swedish Tax Agency: Excise duties The VAT is 12% (food tax) for drinks sold in shops having up to 3.5% alcohol, and 25% above that, and at restaurants. \\"Payday evening - vote yes!\\" Poster from 1922 Swedish prohibition referendum. Systembolaget has a strict monopoly status on alcohol sales to consumers in Sweden, except for restaurant and bars, where alcohol can be sold for immediate consumption (bottles must be opened and can't be brought home). Other companies (producers and importers) can sell directly to restaurant and bars (EU enforced rule). Producers of alcohol, such as vineyards, however, are not allowed to sell bottles of their products to consumers. The only exceptions to the monopoly to consumers are export shops at airports, which can sell alcohol to people checked in for a flight outside the EU. Alcohol cannot be sold on boats on Swedish waters, but the shop is opened at the border to international or foreign waters. The import quota from other EU countries does not apply to personal use (unlimited). Due to the taxes many Swedes supply themselves in Estonia or Germany. Limited rations of duty-free shopping is allowed on the ferries between Sweden and Finland, provided they dock at √Öland, which is an autonomous part of Finland, and has a special treaty with the EU. Ordering alcohol for mail order delivery is permitted, but the Swedish state is able to levy taxes on the recipient of such alcohol. Moonshining sometimes occurs, mainly in rural areas. Distilling without a commercial production license is illegal in Sweden, even for personal use, and might result in fines or jail time. The mere act of owning parts of a still is also illegal. Restaurants and bars Restaurant outdoor areas have to be separated from the street to get alcohol permit Alcohol can be sold in restaurants, bars and nightclubs. The age limit is 18, though some nightclubs voluntarily require a minimum age at the door above 18 (usually 20 or 23, occasionally up to 27; 30 has occurred). Alcohol may be served only between 11 AM-1 AM. Municipalities can permit a later closure time, sometimes as late as 5 AM.Riktlinjer f√∂r serveringstillst√•nd (Swedish) Alcohol is only allowed to be sold at bars if they are defined as restaurants, which means they have to offer warm food on location. After 23:00 a simple menu is enough. Restaurants, bars and pubs need permission from the municipality to sell alcohol. Overly drunk people must not be allowed to enter premises with an alcohol license. People who get noticeably intoxicated while at the premises must not be served more and in more serious cases have to be removed immediately. The alcohol must be for immediate consumption, meaning that the staff has to open bottles. Guests are not allowed to bring alcoholic drinks into the restaurant or out from it. This includes if there is an adjacent convenience store, people are not allowed to buy 3.5% beer and drink in the restaurant, which has been a problem especially at hotel lobbies. In trains, people are not allowed to drink their own alcohol, but sales might take place if there is a permission.J√§rnv√§gslag (2004:519) Outdoor areas in restaurants must be clearly separated from the street. Restaurants must claim payment for every single glass and bottle sold. The inclusion of a first drink in the admission fee is prohibited. It is legal to sell large bottles of hard alcohol to groups, but not after 1 a.m. From the 19th century to 1977 restaurants had to serve warm food when alcohol was sold. Many people bought simple food which they did not eat. It could be as simple as a boiled egg. Regulars who were known not to eat the food were often served food which had already been served to other customers. Hotels Hotels can sell alcohol if it has a restaurant permission. This includes the right to have a minibar or sell by room service, if all guests in that room are at least 18. In any case guests are allowed to bring and consume their own alcohol in the hotel room.Alkohollag (2010:1622) 8.kap 5¬ß, 23¬ß, 24¬ß Temperance movement The temperance movement has been strong in Sweden, especially in agricultural areas, and often connected with the \\"free churches\\" (non-conformists, that is Protestants outside the Church of Sweden).

This airport is named after Tjilik Riwut,http://www.nila-riwut.com/id/tjilik-riwut/tjilik-riwut-my-father the second Governor of Central Kalimantan. The airport served about 1 million passengers in 2018.  History  Tjilik Riwut Airport formerly Panarung Airport, opened on 1 May 1958 the inauguration was carried out by the Central Borneo Resident viz. Mr. Tjilik Riwut. At that time it can be used and landed by a Twin Otter aircraft (from the Indonesian Air Force). On 24 September 1973 Panarung Airport by the Regional Government of Central Borneo was handed over to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation at the Department Transportation of Indonesia. Since then the responsibility of the Central Borneo Regional Government has shifted completely to the central government, as a follow up to the handover by the Minister of Transportation Mr. Prof. Dr. Emil Salim declared Panarung Palangka Raya Airport as an domestic airport using a Fokker 27 aircraft. Panarung Airport becomes Tjilik Riwut Airport Coinciding with the commemoration of National Heroes' Day on 10 November 1988 the name of Tjilik Riwut (former Governor of Central Borneo), enshrined for the airport name (previously named Panarung Airport). The name change to Tjilik Riwut Airport and the signing of the inscription was carried out by the Minister of Transportation Republic of Indonesia Ir. Azwar Anas. The name change is in accordance with the proposal of the Governor of Central Borneo, and recommendations / responses of Minister of the Interior. The prescription of the name is because Tjilik Riwut is a National Hero (Dekrit Presiden Republik Indonesia tanggal 6 November 1988, No.108 / TK / 1988). On 28 March 2019 the airport's new terminal began operations, all flight activities at the airport's old terminal were moved to the new airport terminal. Then on 8 April 2019 the new terminal of Tjilik Riwut Airport was inaugurated by President of the Republic of Indonesia Joko Widodo. Terminal facilities The capacity of the airport has increased after the new terminal was officially inaugurated on 28 March 2019. The total terminal capacity at that time was 15,000 square meters, able to serve 1,000 passengers daily. The terminal was extended further with an area of 29,124 square meters; the double level terminal can now serve 2,200 passengers daily. There are a few shops and restaurants in the terminal to serve the passengers. The airport has its own taxi service for arrival passengers; alternative local taxi and transport companies such as Grab, GoJek and small local buses (angkot) are not permitted to collect passengers from the airport.

The book also discusses \\"birthmarks and birth defects that match those of a deceased person who is identified by the child\\". The foreword to the book is written by Ian Stevenson. This book claims that consciousness can be considered separately from the brain, which provides a basis for claims of reincarnation. Tucker discusses objections to reincarnation: the paucity of persons who actually claim to remember a past life, the fragility of memories, the population explosion, the mind‚Äîbody problem, fraud, and others. Tucker states that none of the cases examined are perfect, and that \\"faulty memory by informants\\" is seen to be the \\"best normal explanation for many of the cases\\" reviewed in the book.

Members of the subfamily are collectively known as avulaviruses. All members of the subfamily primarily infect birds. Avulavirinae was previously recognized as the genus Avulavirus before being elevated to a subfamily. The term avula comes from \\"avian rubula\\", distinguishing it from rubulaviruses of the subfamily Rubulavirinae due to avulaviruses only infecting birds and translating protein V from an edited RNA transcript. The most notable avulavirus is the Newcastle disease virus, a strain of Avian orthoavulavirus 1. Taxonomy Subfamily: Avulavirinae :Genus: Metaavulavirus, which contains ten species, numbered 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 15, and 20 :Genus: Orthoavulavirus, which contains nine species, numbered 1, 9, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 21 :Genus: Paraavulavirus, which contains two species, numbered 3 and 4 Prior to the subfamily being elevated from genus, members of the genus were known as Avian paramyxovirus, then later as Avian avulavirus, followed by numbers 1 to 19, which designated the species number. These numbers, along with the 20th and 21st members of the subfamily, are now dispersed across the three genera. Each species is named Avian followed by the name of its genus and its individual number, for example Avian orthoavulavirus 1. Characteristics Avulaviruses have a hemagglutinin-neuraminidase attachment protein and do not produce a non-structural protein C. Avulaviruses can be separated into distinct serotypes using hemagglutination assay and neuraminidase assay. All avulaviruses hemagglutinate chicken RBCs except for avian metaavulavirus 5 which does not hemagglutinate RBCs from any species. Avian metaavulavirus 6 is unique to the presence of the SH gene between the F and HN genes. Avian metaavulavirus 11 has the longest genome among the APMVs.

History  The French military opened the first radio broadcasting station in Dakar in 1932. It began broadcasting civilian programming in 1939. The origins of RTS are in Radio-Dakar, created in 1950, that broadcast eight hours per day. In 1951 two channels appear: Dakar Inter and Dakar Afrique, broadcast to listeners across western Africa. In 1959, the fusion of Mali and Senegal into the Mali Federation causes the creation of Radio Mali, its bases being in Radio Inter. On August 20, 1960, when Senegal separated from the Mali Federation, Radio Mali became Radio Senegal with two channels: one national and the other international. An unnamed Radio Senegal engineer making a field recording of a UNESCO-sponsored functional literacy class for co-operative farmers in the city of Khenene in 1971 In 1962, Radio Senegal became the flagship member of the Union of African National Television and Radio Organizations and its successor, the African Union of Broadcasting. In 1965, the Senegalese government began its first television broadcasts, which come to an end in 1972. However, the Munich Olympics created a demand that incited the Senegalese government to create an institution producing both television and radio broadcasts. The Office de Radiodiffusion T√©l√©vision du S√©n√©gal (ORTS) was created in 1973, operating two radio channels and a national television channel. On 4 October 1973, ORTS which had been in talks with Radio Gambia about producing a joint radio programme based on Senegambian history and broadcast in the local languages came to an agreement, and the first ever recording of the programme Chossani Senegambia (the history of Senegambia) was made.Joof, Alhaji Alieu Ebrima Cham.

Such collections share characteristics with glossaries and thesauri, but are not true lexicons, such as the ko≈õa of Sanskrit literature. Particular collections are also called '. While a number of nighantavas devoted to specialized subjects exist, the eponymous Nighantu of the genre is an ancient collection, handed down from Vedic times. It was the subject of the Nirukta,' (Nirukta 1.1) a commentary, together with a treatise on etymology, by Yaska. Technically, Yaska's Nirukta should designate his commentary only, but traditionally the Nighantu has been understood to be included in it. The Traditional Nighantu According to Yaska (Nirukta 1.20), the Nighantu was a collection of rare or difficult words gathered by earlier sages for easier understanding of Vedic texts that perhaps they may not have fully understood themselves. The collection comprises five adhyƒÅyas or chapters, in three 's or books: * ': three adhyƒÅyas of similes, synonyms, metonyms and other glosses. The first adhyƒÅya deals mainly with physical things and objects of nature. The second adhyƒÅya deals mainly with man, his physical being, and qualities associated with his being, such as property and emotional states. The third adhyƒÅya deals mainly with abstract qualities and concepts. * ': one adhyƒÅya of homonyms (aikapadikam) and particularly difficult or ambiguous words. * ': one adhyƒÅya of epithets of divine beings. Yaska's Nirukta covers the Naighantuka somewhat synoptically, often merely echoing a given gloss, but deals with the 278 words of the Naigama and the 151 names of the Daivata in detail. A full word-by-word commentary on the Naighantuka was written by Devarajayajvan, some time before the 14th CE.Sarup, Part I, p.50 A critical edition of the Nighantu and the Nirukta was published in the 1920s by Lakshman Sarup.

A traditional theologian, he is known for his willingness to celebrate Mass in the Extraordinary Form of the Roman Rite. Cordileone has become known for his outspoken opposition to same-sex marriage. Early life and ministry Salvatore Cordileone was born in San Diego, California, and attended Crawford High School from 1971 to 1974. He then studied at San Diego State University for a year before entering the University of San Diego, from where he earned a Bachelor's degree in Philosophy in 1978. He then furthered his studies in Rome at the Pontifical Gregorian University, earning a Baccalaureate in Sacred Theology, a type of post-graduate degree, in 1981. Returning to the United States, Cordileone was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Leo Thomas Maher on July 9, 1982. He then served as an associate pastor at Saint Martin of Tours Parish in La Mesa until 1985, when he returned to the Gregorian and earned a doctorate in canon law in 1989. Cordileone, upon his return to the Diocese of San Diego, served as secretary to Bishop Robert Brom and a tribunal judge (1989‚Äì1990), adjutant judicial vicar (1990‚Äì1991), and pastor of Our Lady of Guadalupe Parish in Calexico (1991‚Äì1995). In the summer of 1995, he returned to Rome to work as an assistant at the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura, the highest judicial body in the Vatican under the pope. He was raised to the rank of Chaplain of His Holiness in 1999. Episcopal career=Auxiliary Bishop of San Diego On July 5, 2002, Cordileone was appointed as Auxiliary Bishop of San Diego and Titular Bishop of Natchesium by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on August 21, 2002 from Bishop Robert H. Brom, with Bishops Raymond Burke and Gilbert Espinosa Ch√°vez serving as co-consecrators. Cordileone serves on the episcopal advisory board of the Institute for Religious Life and St. Gianna Physician's Guild. Cordileone is considered to be theologically conservative. At the annual meeting of the U.S. bishops in Baltimore in November, 2006, in the course of consideration of the document which issued as \\"Happy Are Those Who Are Called to His Supper\\"\\"Happy Are Those Who Are Called to His Supper\\":On Preparing to Receive Christ Worthily in the Eucharist, p. 9 he proposed to the gathered bishops that the use of contraception should be included in a list of thoughts or actions constituting grave matter.U.S. Catholic bishops tackle contraception, gays, communion, Ann Rodgers, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, November 15, 2006 The proposal was defeated, although a separate document approved at the meeting mentioned that the Catholic Church says that \\"contraception is objectively immoral.\\"Married Love and the Gift of Life, p. 4 Within the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, he sat on the Bishops' and Presidents' Committee on Catholic Education from 2006-2009. Bishop of Oakland Cordileone was later named the fourth Bishop of Oakland by Pope Benedict XVI on March 23, 2009. Filling the vacancy left by Bishop Allen Vigneron's promotion to Archbishop of Detroit in January, Cordileone's relatively quick appointment was speculated to have been related to accusations that the diocese's interim administrator had blessed same-sex unions. Cordileone's installation occurred on May 5, 2009, at the Cathedral of Christ the Light in Oakland. On September 20, 2009, Cordileone offered a Pontifical High Mass (in Latin, Missa Pontificalis) in Saint Margaret Mary Church in Oakland. This was the first time a Tridentine Pontifical High Mass was offered in Northern California after the liturgical changes that followed the Second Vatican Council were finalized in 1969. From 2011-2017, Cordileone was the chairman of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops' Ad Hoc Committee for the Defense of Marriage (later renamed a subcommittee) in which capacity he worked against the legalization of same-sex marriage. His mission was described by the USCCB as preserving the definition of marriage as the union between one man and one woman. In a June 2012 EWTN News interview, Cordileone stated that a redefinition of marriage to include homosexual couples would be bad for children, detrimental to society and dangerous for religious freedom. Archbishop of San Francisco Archbishop Cordileone gives a homily in 2014 On July 27, 2012, Pope Benedict XVI named Cordileone Archbishop of San Francisco. The appointment of Cordileone, and the acceptance of the resignation of his predecessor, Archbishop George Hugh Niederauer, were both announced on July 27 in Washington, D.C., by Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan√≤, Papal and Apostolic nuncio to the United States of America. Cordileone was installed on October 4, 2012, the patronal Feast day of Saint Francis of Assisi at the Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption in San Francisco, California. =Drunk driving offense= Shortly before his installation as archbishop on August 26, 2012, Cordileone was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol at a police checkpoint in San Diego.Staff report (August 27, 2012).

He was also required to attend a Mothers Against Drunk Driving victim-impact panel and a three-month first conviction program through the state Department of Motor Vehicles. =Call for replacement= In February 2015 the Archbishop presented a statement to Catholic school teachers within his archdiocese saying Catholic school employees are expected to conduct their public lives in a way that doesn‚Äôt undermine or deny the church's doctrine. Democratic Assemblymen Phil Ting of San Francisco and Kevin Mullin of San Mateo immediately wrote and then made public a letter to Cordileone which was signed by every lawmaker representing the communities served by the four Catholic high schools in San Francisco, San Mateo and Marin counties, urging the Archbishop to withdraw what they called \\"discriminatory morality clauses\\".http://asmdc.org/members/a19/news-room/press-releases/lawmakers-urge- sf-archbishop-to-withdraw-discriminatory-morality-clauses Cordileone responded, saying he \\"respects the lawmakers‚Äô right to hire whoever may advance their mission and that he is asking for the same respect\\". Phil Ting and Kevin Mulin then called for an investigation of working conditions at high schools administrated by the Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco, over the archbishop's proposed morality clauses for teachers. On 16 April 2015, over 100 Catholic donors and church members from the Bay Area signed a full page advertisement in the San Francisco Chronicle appealing to Pope Francis to replace Cordileone as archbishop of the San Francisco archdiocese, specifically objecting to Cordileone's characterization of sex outside of marriage and homosexual relations as \\"gravely evil\\", saying Cordileone fosters \\"an atmosphere of division and intolerance\\". The archdiocese responded that the advertisement was a \\"misrepresentation of the spirit of the archbishop\\" and that it was also a misrepresentation to suggest the signers speak for the Catholic community in the Bay Area. In response to this advertisement categorized as \\"dissidents\\" in an op-ed piece from the San Mateo Daily Journal,http://www.smdailyjournal.com/articles/opinions/2015-05-01/letter- support-for-archbishop-cordileone/1776425142581.html over 7,500 letters of support were received from members of Cordileone's diocese, as well as from around the world. A subsequent picnic and show of support attended by hundreds of people was held on Saturday, May 16, 2015 at the Sue Bierman Park in San Francisco. =Chairman of the USCCB Committee on Laity, Marriage, Family Life, and Youth= On November 14, 2018, at the autumn General Assembly of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops in Baltimore, Md., there was a tie in the election to name a successor to Archbishop Charles Chaput of Philadelphia as chairman of the Committee on Laity, Marriage, Family Life, and Youth. Archbishop Cordileone and Bishop John Doerfler of Marquette each received 125 votes. Archbishop Cordileone was declared the winner by virtue of being the bishop senior in consecration. Opposition to LGBT rights=Same-sex marriage A vocal opponent of gay rights and same-sex marriage, Cordileone helped to draft Proposition 8 in 2008, California's Constitutional amendment to define marriage as between one man and one woman, and raise substantial sums to pass it.Salvatore Cordileone, Gay Marriage Opponent And Prop. 8 Creator, Named Archbishop Of San Francisco, Huffington Post 7/27/2012Nancy Pelosi urges S.F. archbishop to exit marriage march, San Francisco Chronicle, 14 June 2014. He said, \\"Only one idea of marriage can stand...If that's going to be considered bigoted, we're going to see our rights being taken away-as is already happening.\\" In an interview with USA Today on March 21, 2013, concerning the Supreme Court's then-pending decision on the constitutionality of Proposition 8, Cordileone argued against same-sex marriage, saying that it would harm children. Cordileone personally contributed $13,000 in support of Proposition 8. In 2009, Cordileone is one of seventeen United States bishops to sign the Manhattan Declaration: A Call of Christian Conscience, a document asserting opposition to same-sex marriage, abortion and assisted suicide, and to what signers feel is an infringement on freedom of religion. Cordileone took part as a featured speaker in the June 2014 March for Marriage, a rally against same-sex marriage in Washington DC.Kellan Howell, \\"Thousands march in defense of traditional marriage\\", The Washington Times, 19 June 2014 The event was organized by the National Organization for Marriage and its sponsors included: Concerned Women for America, The Family Leader, The Heritage Foundation, Human Life International, and the Family Research Council. Before the event, at least 80 religious leaders and local and state lawmakers and officials (including the Mayor of San Francisco) collected a petition with 30,000 signatures and wrote publicly urging Cordileone not to take part in the event, which they saw as anti-LGBT, and specifically objected to Cordileone, \\"marching and sharing the podium with individuals who have repeatedly denigrated lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people.\\" The Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi wrote privately urging him not to take part. Cordileone responded in a letter in which he said the march was not anti-LGBT or anti-anything, but pro-marriage. Executive order on LGBT employment On 20 June 2014, jointly with other chairmen of committees within the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Cordileone also expressed concern over the reported intention of Barack Obama to issue an executive order on LGBT employment, which would outlaw discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in enterprises with federal contracts. The chairs expressed concern that the order might oblige managers to violate their personal religious beliefs.Michael Gryboski, \\"Catholic Church Leaders Express Their Concerns Over Obama's Pending Executive Order on LGBT Employment\\" in Christian Post, 23 June 2014 The same three bishops published on 17 July 2014 a note explaining their opposition to the order and arguing that such a measure \\"is not about protecting persons, but behavior\\", and \\"uses the force of the law to coerce everyone to accept a deeply problematic understanding of human sexuality and sexual behavior and to condone such behavior\\".\\"Anti-gay Archbishop: Homophobia isn't 'truly unjust' because sexual behaviour is a choice\\" in Pink News, 19 July 2014 Coat of arms The coat of arms chosen by Cordileone has two sections. The upper part is a representation of his Italian surname Cor di leone, which means \\"heart of lion\\", and shows the top part of a lion rampant holding a red heart in its paws. The lower part shows a red crab, a reference to the crab-fishing occupation of the Cordileone family on its arrival in California and as a reference to a bishop's duty to be a \\"fisher of men\\" (). The crab is also a reference to the constellation of Cancer, which is associated with the month of July, the month of Cordileone's ordination as a priest and of his appointment as a bishop. The motto, In verbo tuo, meaning \\"At your word\\" is a reference to the response of Peter, \\"At your word I will let down the nets\\", when invited by Jesus: \\"Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch\\" ().

The song is sometimes mistaken for being in the Sami language. The words of the song were performed in Norwegian by Sverre Kjelsberg, while Mattis H√¶tta contributed with the yoik chorus - a Sami form of vocal music without words; the title of the song is however in the Northern Sami language, translating as \\"Sami Earth\\" or \\"Sami Soil\\". There are no actual Sami words in the joik chorus- instead, the syllables \\"lo\\" and \\"la\\" are simply repeated, giving rise to another popular title for the song, \\"L√•la\\".  Conception  The song was inspired by the autonomy movement among the Sami people of northern Norway, with the duo singing that the demand for autonomy was made in a very subdued manner. Mention is also made of the traditional music of the region, the yoik, which is described as being \\"stronger than gunpowder\\" in the lyrics. The line \\"framf√∏rr tinget der dem satt, h√∏rtes joiken dag og natt\\" (in front of the parliament where they sat, the yoik was heard day and night), refers to a hunger strike by Sami activists in front of the Norwegian parliament building in October 1979 in connection with the Alta controversy, where Mattis H√¶tta first performed the yoik that constituted the song's chorus. The song was thus performed the year before the contest. The song describes the Sami world as coming like a \\"puff of wind from the north\\", before it turned into a \\"storm\\". The final lyrics of the song claim that \\"a joik is more powerful than weapons... because it has neither a beginning nor an end.\\"  Performance in the Eurovision Song Contest  The song was performed eleventh on the night, following Finland's Vesa-Matti Loiri with \\"Huilumies\\" and preceding Germany's Katja Ebstein with \\"Theater\\". At the close of voting, it had received 15 points, placing 16th in a field of 19.  Influence  This song was among the first instance of Sami influence on the wider culture of Europe.

As the largest airport in Central Sulawesi, Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport serves as the main port of entry to the city of Palu as well as the surrounding area. The name airport can be separated into two part, \\"Mutiara\\" and \\"SIS Al-Jufrie\\". \\"Mutiara\\" means pearl in Indonesian, while \\"SIS Al- Jufrie\\" is an abbreviation of Sayyid Idrus bin Salim Al-Jufri, an Arab- Indonesian religious figure and an Indonesian National Hero from Central Sulawesi. He was a propagator of Islam in Central Sulawesi until his death in Palu in 1969. SIS Aljufri is also a religious figure and founder of the religious organization Alkhairaat that grew and developed rapidly in eastern Indonesia. History The name \\"Mutiara\\" means \\"pearl\\" in the Indonesian language. It was named by the first Indonesian president Sukarno. This name was given by President Sukarno when visiting Palu on October 10, 1957. Sukarno then asked the name of this airfield to Rajawali Pusadan, the Regent of Donggala Regency at that time. At that time, the airfield was named Masovu which in Kaili language means \\"Dusty Land\\". The reason was when Sukarno was landing in Palu, which was still within the Donggala Regency, he saw the area glistening like a pearl. To commemorate Sayyid Idrus bin Salim Al-Jufri, an Indonesian religious figure and National Hero from Central Sulawesi, on 2014, the name SIS Al-Jufri was added to the airport's current name, making the official name of the airport known as Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport. On 28 September 2018, Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport suffered severe damage during the 2018 Sulawesi earthquake and was forced to close after large cracks, one of which was 500 metres long, formed in the runway. In addition, the airport's control tower collapsed, and navigation systems were also extensively damaged. Anthonius Gunawan Agung, an ATC officer who had been directing a Batik Air flight 6231 (the last flight out of the day at the airport) take-off at the time of the earthquake was fatally injured after falling from the ATC tower and died in the following hours. The airport opened with limited services the following day. Development A new terminal built with government fund of Rp 139.2 billion was officially operated to coincide with the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of Central Sulawesi on 13 April 2017. The airport terminal is able to accommodate 800 passengers daily with an area of 4,800 meters. The terminal building is made of soundproof material that can reduce the vibration, so that passengers remain comfortable and not disturbed aircraft noise. Some parts of the walls use glass so it is more energy efficient and looks bright all day. Thus, it can save electrical energy so no need to turn on the electric light during the day. The new building is also designed with a variety of proper functions to enable passengers to circulate in it, as well as the implementation of security systems that can separate each user-based function and required level of security. It was also designed how this building would later be developed to accommodate future needs improvement. The terminal is designed with a modular system that uses wide span structures in order to facilitate future development processes to accommodate the increasing flow of air transport. In the future, the runway is planned to be extended to 3,000 meters from the current 2,500 meters. This would allow the airport to accommodate wide-body aircraft such as the Boeing 747 and the Airbus A330. This would also help in preparation of making the airport for Hajj embarkation in the near future, as well as the possibility of serving international flights. Facilities The airport is located at an altitude of 86 meters (282 ft) above sea level. It has one concrete runway, 15/33 measuring 2,500 x 45 meters. It can hold wide-body aircraft operations. The Central Sulawesi Government upgraded the airport to an international airport, considering Central Sulawesi increasing population and tourism interest in the region.

She lived during the time of the Weimar Republic. Early life Born in Leipzig to Felix Berber, First Violinist with the Municipal Orchestra, and his wife, Lucie Berber, an aspiring actress and singer, who later divorced, Anita Berber was raised mainly by her grandmother in Dresden. By the age of 16, she had moved to Berlin and made her debut as a cabaret dancer. By 1918 she was working in film, and she began dancing nude in 1919. Scandalously androgynous, she quickly made a name for herself. She wore heavy dancer's make-up, which on the black-and-white photos and films of the time came across as jet black lipstick painted across the heart-shaped part of her skinny lips, and charcoaled eyes. Notoriety in Berlin Berber's hair was fashionably cut into a short bob and was frequently bright red, as in 1925 when the German painter Otto Dix painted a portrait of her, titled \\"The Dancer Anita Berber\\". Her dancer friend and sometime lover Sebastian Droste, who performed in the film Algol (1920), was skinny and had black hair with gelled up curls much like sideburns. Neither of them wore much more than lowslung loincloths and Anita occasionally a corsage, placed well below her breasts.

(2003) The Coming of the Third Reich. New York: Penguin. p.125. - broke boundaries with their androgyny and total nudity, but it was her public appearances that really challenged social taboos. Berber's overt drug addiction and bisexuality were matters of public gossip. In addition to her addiction to cocaine, opium and morphine, one of Berber's favourites forms of inebriation was chloroform and ether mixed in a bowl. This would be stirred with a white rose, the petals of which she would then eat.Berlin: Metropolis of Vice. Paradigm Pictures, 2005. Aside from her addiction to narcotic drugs, Berber was also an alcoholic. In 1928, at the age of 29, she suddenly gave up alcohol completely, but died later the same year. According to Mel Gordon, in The Seven Addictions and Five Professions of Anita Berber: Weimar Berlin's Priestess of Debauchery,Gordon, Seven Addictions she had been diagnosed with severe tuberculosis while performing abroad. After collapsing in Damascus, she returned to Germany and died in a Kreuzberg hospital on 10 November 1928, although rumour had it that she died surrounded by empty morphine syringes. Berber was buried in a pauper's grave in St. Thomas Cemetery in Neuk√∂lln.\\"Anarchists of Style: Anita Berber, Part 2\\" http://www.wornthrough.com/2011/01/11/anarchists-of-style-anita-berber- part-2/.Wilson, Scott.

Marriages In 1919, Berber entered into a marriage of convenience with a man with the surname Nathusius. She later left him in order to pursue a relationship with a woman named Susi Wanowski, and became part of the Berlin lesbian scene.Capovilla (2001), p.50 Berber's second marriage, in 1922, was to Sebastian Droste.

Garner, a native of Uvalde, lived there until 1952, when he moved to a small cottage on the property and donated the main house to the City of Uvalde as a memorial to Mrs. Garner. The house is now known as the Briscoe-Garner Museum, and also known as the Ettie R. Garner Memorial Building. The structure is a two-story H-shaped tan brick home with dark wood shingles highlighted by a row of red clay tiles. It was built to plans by Atlee B. Ayres, at the time the most prominent architect in San Antonio, if not the state.http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/utaaa/00041/aaa-00041.html The building housed the community library until about 1973. It then became a museum, using the first floor for displays documenting Garner's life and career. The main house and cottage were designated a National Historic Landmark and and listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 8, 1976. On November 20, 1999, the City of Uvalde transferred ownership of the Garner Home and Museum to the University of Texas at Austin, whereupon it became a division of the Dolph Briscoe Center for American History. In 2011, the University closed the house to the public for renovations. The displays were moved to the First State Bank of Uvalde main branch lobby. When the renovations are complete, the first floor will still be devoted to Garner, and the second floor will have new exhibits dedicated to Dolph Briscoe, the 41st Governor of Texas and also a Uvalde native.

The airport has been managed by PT. Angkasa Pura II since January 2007. It was originally named Pangkalpinang Airport built since the Japanese occupation of 1942 as a defense against Allied soldiers. In accordance with the letter of the Secretary General of the Ministry of Transportation. 378 / TLK / DEPHUB / VIII / 85 dated 22 August 1985 the name of the airport was changed to airport. Based on the Decree of the Minister of Transportation No. SK.1 / AU.106 / PHB-99 dated 25 August 1999, Pangkalpinang Airport was changed to Amir Bangka Airport, which is an UPT from Vertical Institution of Directorate General of Civil Aviation, Ministry of Transportation. Since January 1, 2007, the airport was handed over to a state- owned company in charge of the management of several airports in western Indonesia, namely PT. Angkasa Pura II (Persero). For air space controlled by the Air Traffic Service Unit of Depati Amir Airport initially only serves the area around the airport up to 2500 feet altitude. In 1992, the border area expanded, with a horizontal limit of up to 30 Nm, and a vertical limit of 15,000 feet. In 2008 after being managed by PT. Angkasa Pura II, horizontal boundaries widened to a distance of varied 80 Nm, while the vertical limit to 24,500 feet. Since January 1, 2013 airspace management at Depati Amir Airport has been transferred to the Indonesian Air Navigation Service Provider or AirAsia Operator. It is one of the two main airport in Bangka Belitung province, the other being H.A.S. Hanandjoeddin International Airport in Belitung. Future planning In 1978, the foundation was moved to the west for about 75 meters, with a length of 1200m. Then gradually continue to be extended 1600 m, 1800m, 2000m and now, the runway reached the length of 2600m x 45m. This airport runway has been able to land aircraft type Boeing 737-800NG / 900ER, & Airbus A320, although in a limited capacity. The aircraft parking lot (apron) has also been overlaid several times (asphalt thickening). The airport apron has been able to accommodate 4 narrow-body aircraft at once, such as Boeing 737-800NG / 900ER, & Airbus A320. Terminal After multiple delays, a new airport terminal finally started operation on 11 January 2017. With an investment of about 300 billion rupiah, the construction of the terminal is able to increase the passenger capacity of 350 thousand passengers per year to more than 1.5 million passengers per year. The new terminal building stands on an area of 12 thousand square meters of total land area of about 152 hectares. Nevertheless, it currently only serves domestic flights. Revitalization is done on the airport's landside which includes construction of a new terminal, improvement of terminal facilities, construction of a new apron, as well as construction of a larger and more spacious car parking area. Besides being larger, the new terminal also has a modern design and is equipped with additional amenities such as food courts, executive break room, internet facilities, disabled toilets, as well as a room mother and child.Bandara Pangkalpinang Kini Punya Terminal Senilai Rp300 M Other facilities include 12 check-in counters, 3 departure gates, and 2 jetbridges.

He served twice in Congress during two widely separated periods, elected first as a Unionist Democratic Congressman in 1862, as a Republican US Senator in 1865, and later as a Republican Congressman in 1884. He was elected as the 19th Governor of Louisiana, serving from 1864 to 1865 during the American Civil War, when the state was occupied by Union troops. He was the first German-born governor in the United States, and is also claimed as the first ethnic Jewish governor. By that time he was a practicing Episcopalian. In 1865 Hahn was elected as a US Senator, but Radical Republicans refused to allow him and other Southerners to be seated. Later he was elected for several terms as a Republican to the state House during the Reconstruction era, where he was also elected as Speaker. Hahn was active as a publisher and editor, owning and operating three newspapers in succession that supported the Republican Party, its program, and its candidates in the state. He spent much of his wealth in supporting these papers. Hahn continued to be politically active, being elected to Congress from Louisiana's 2nd congressional district in 1884 with a strong majority. He served about a year before his death in office. Early life and education Hahn was born in 1830 as the last child in his family, in Klingenm√ºnster, Palatinate, then part of the Kingdom of Bavaria, now of Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. His father died before he was born. Some sources indicate that Hahn's parents were Jewish. With his widowed mother and four older siblings, Hahn immigrated as a child to the United States, arriving in New York City. The family traveled to the Republic of Texas, before settling in New Orleans in 1840. The following year, Hahn's mother died of yellow fever and the children were orphaned. With the help of his older siblings, Hahn continued his education and graduated from City High School. In 1849 at the age of 19, he began reading law under Christian Roselius, a prominent Whig attorney and later Attorney General of Louisiana. In 1851, Hahn graduated from the University of Louisiana (Tulane University) with a law degree. He worked in Roselius' office after getting his degree. Political career The following year Hahn was elected to the New Orleans city school board at the age of 22; he ran the school system as its director. He joined the Democratic party faction led by Pierre Soul√©. In the Presidential Election of 1860, Hahn supported Stephen Douglas. He was fluent in English, French and German. In 1860 Hahn opposed secession, delivering a pro-Union speech in Lafayette Square. He avoided taking an oath of allegiance to the Confederacy. Opposed to secession and a supporter of the Union, Hahn was elected in 1862 as a Republican and the U.S. Representative from Louisiana's 2nd congressional district. This incorporated most of New Orleans, which had been occupied by Union forces. Hahn was one of two Louisiana Representatives seated in the 37th Congress, which adjourned on March 4, 1863, during the Civil War. Eventually, Hahn advised that there should be no more representation from Louisiana until it was \\"reconstructed.\\" During his time in Washington, Hahn met and befriended President Abraham Lincoln. Term as governor In March 1864 Colonel's Short Villa briefly served as the executive mansion of the newly elected Federal Governor of Louisiana, Michael Hahn. In 1864, with almost all of Louisiana under federal occupation, General Nathaniel P. Banks, the Union Military Commander of the Department of the Gulf (responsible, among other things, for civil order in occupied Louisiana), called state elections and convened a constitutional convention. Benjamin Franklin Flanders and Thomas Jefferson Durant, prominent Unionists, opposed the moderate plan called for by General Banks. Hahn purchased a pro-slavery newspaper, the New Orleans True Delta, and used it to promote moderate Unionism supporting Banks' plan, including emancipation of slaves. Hahn ran for Governor for the Free-State Party and won the election with 54% or 11,411 votes. J. Q. A. Fellows, a conservative Democrat, received 26% or 2,996 votes; and Benjamin Franklin Flanders, the radical Republican, received 20% or 2,232 votes. Hahn was elected as the first German-born governor of an American state. He is also claimed as the first ethnic Jewish governor in the United States; by then he was worshipping as an Episcopalian. Hahn's inauguration in Lafayette Square, New Orleans, featured a huge brass band led by Patrick Gilmore. On March 4, 1864, Hahn was inaugurated as Governor of Union-held Louisiana in an elaborate ceremony paid for by General Banks. As governor, Hahn supported universal education. In his term, Hahn tried to gain suffrage for freedmen and previously free people of color, but it was too early. He approved the state's ratification of the 15th Amendment. Hahn's administration made serious attempts to ensure enfranchisement of black Louisianans, laid the foundation for a public school system for blacks, and began an aborted Reconstruction in Louisiana. Governor Hahn played a leading role in the state constitutional convention of 1864, but he was opposed by Major General Stephen A. Hurlbut, who replaced Banks as commander of the Department of the Gulf. General Hurlburt refused to recognize the state civil government of Hahn. Hahn resigned as governor in March 1865, and was elected by the state legislature to the U.S. Senate in 1865. However, Radical Republicans did not seat him, as they believed the state had more work to do before being allowed to rejoin the Union. Lieutenant Governor James Madison Wells succeeded Hahn as governor after his resignation. Political editor and congressman After President Lincoln was assassinated in April 1865, Congress refused to seat any Representatives or Senators from the South until a reconstruction plan could be carried out. Senator-elect Hahn returned to New Orleans and allied with radical Republicans calling for a convention to revise Louisiana's Constitution of 1864 to include black suffrage. He was shot and severely wounded on July 30, 1866, in the New Orleans Riot. In 1867 Hahn became editor and manager of the New Orleans Republican newspaper, his platform for opposing President Andrew Johnson's lenient Reconstruction program. In 1872 Hahn retired to a plantation in St. Charles Parish. There he established the village of Hahnville and published his third newspaper, the St. Charles Herald. On his plantation, he grew sugar cane,, the common commodity crop in the \\"sugar parishes\\" of this region. From 1871 to 1878 Hahn served in the Louisiana State Legislature. He was elected as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee and Speaker of the House. In 1878 he was appointed as Superintendent of the U.S. Mint in New Orleans, serving until January 1879. At that point, Hahn was appointed Judge of the 26th state judicial district, which included Saint John the Baptist, Saint Charles, and Jefferson parishes. During the 1880 elections, Hahn established and edited the New Orleans Ledger to promote Republican candidates. Although Democrats had regained control of the state legislature, Hahn was personally admired for his integrity and consistency of position. In 1884 Hahn was elected to Congress as the Republican candidate from Louisiana's 2nd congressional district - a race which he won handily by 3,000 votes.\\"Hahn, George Michael Decker\\" , Dictionary of Louisiana Biography, Louisiana Historical Association, 2008, accessed 2 March 2016 Serving as the only Republican Congressman from Louisiana, Hahn died on March 15, 1886, in his room at the Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C. He suffered a ruptured blood vessel near his heart. His body was returned to New Orleans. Hahn's funeral was conducted by an Episcopal priest, and he was buried in New Orleans' Metairie Cemetery. He had never married and died poor. He had spent much of his previous wealth in trying to maintain the Republican- oriented newspapers he published.

The Miniature Killer was introduced in the seventh-season premiere; after a season-long arc, she was identified as Natalie Davis in the finale. She made a one-time reappearance in season nine. Modus operandi The key signature of the Miniature Killer's crimes were meticulous scale models built to represent each crime scene. The models were either left at the murder site or delivered to someone involved in solving the case. Every detail was accurate, and even used the victim's blood instead of paint. Every model also contained a hidden picture of a bloodied doll and an item somehow related to bleach. Her victims were killed in widely different manners, including bludgeoning, poisoning, and electrocution. Many of her victims had employed her services as a cleaning lady, and several also had connections to her foster father. Concept and creation The Miniature Killer's modus operandi is inspired by the Nutshell Studies of Unexplained Death, a series of intricate crime-scene dioramas that are actually used to help train the Baltimore Homicide Investigation unit. These dollhouses are explored in detail in the documentary Of Dolls and Murder. Natalie's background Natalie Davis is the elder daughter of Christopher Davis, a talented ventriloquist who billed himself as \\"The Great Rainone\\". Natalie had a younger sister named Chloe. Natalie was jealous of the attention Chloe received from their father, but the two sisters got along reasonably well until their mother died. Soon after, in 1981, Natalie's jealousy drove her over the edge, and she pushed Chloe out of a treehouse to her death. This was the first of her series of murders, and the only one that she did not recreate in miniature. When Natalie looked down from the treehouse at Chloe lying dead, the scene looked like a miniature, and Natalie became obsessed with creating miniatures of her subsequent victims and crime scenes. She later would witness her father cleaning up Chloe's blood with bleach, and bleach would become a psychotic trigger for her killings. Devastated by the loss of Chloe, Davis eventually could not handle caring for Natalie, and put her up for adoption. After going through a string of foster homes, Natalie finally was taken in permanently by Ernie Dell. Dell and Natalie established a strong bond, and he became the first person she really loved. Dell was a model train enthusiast who unwittingly helped her build her first three miniatures. When Dell discovered what the miniatures were being used for, he forgave her and rationalized her actions. In order to protect her, Dell falsely confessed to being the Miniature Killer, and committed suicide on a live video feed that went directly to Gil Grissom. Natalie was devastated by Dell's death and held Grissom responsible. When she discovered his relationship with Sara Sidle, she decided to get revenge by abducting her. Known victims=Chloe Davis Natalie's younger sister (age 4), pushed to her death from a treehouse. Izzy Delancy Grissom and his team found the washed-up rock star dead in his kitchen in the episode Built to Kill, Part 2. His body was sprawled in a chair and leaning forwards onto the table. They determined that the cause of death was a single blow delivered to the back of a head with a rolling pin. The first miniature was found close by. It was a perfect diorama of the kitchen, and even included objects in the garbage and placement of Delancy's blood. In the model they also found a picture of a bloodied doll, hidden behind a mini photo frame, and a bleach container in the miniature garbage. Trigger: On August 25, 2006, Izzy Delancy left a voice mail on Ernie's answering machine, which was also being used by Natalie. Delancy reminded her to use bleach to get the stains out of his sweats. This was most likely the trigger that led to Delancy's murder. Connections: Izzy Delancy sent out a PSA for animal cruelty against the chicken plant where Ernie Dell (Natalie's foster father), as well as Raymundo Suarez (Natalie's third miniatures victim), worked. Natalie worked as a cleaner for Izzy Delancy. Penny Garden In \\"Post Mortem\\", an elderly woman named Penny Garden was found dead, lying through her living room window. It was revealed that she was dying from cancer, and was heavily medicated. Her medication wasn't found at the scene, leading Grissom's team to assume that stealing the medication was the motive of the murder. This led to the suspicion that Penny's reformed-junkie of a nephew was the murderer. However, this theory was put aside when the nephew brought forward a miniature model depicting the murder scene, which was apparently delivered shortly after the CSIs left the scene. After Penny's autopsy revealed that she had ingested a lethal amount of liquid nicotine, Grissom and his team noted that there were traces of glue on the model of Penny's back, and on the chair that she had been sitting in. This led them to believe that the killer had assumed that Penny would have died in her chair from her poisoned cherry brandy, not expecting her to go into convulsions. As Penny stood up in her spastic fits, the killer revealed herself, previously hiding behind Penny, and threw Penny through the window. With the miniature already made to depict Penny dead in her chair, the killer showed signs of obsessive habits, having to fix the model by rearranging it to match the actual death scene before it could be seen by anybody else. This explained why the miniature was not at the scene of death as the first one had been. A camera from Penny Garden's neighborhood showed Ernie Dell (Natalie's foster father) delivering the miniature wearing a jacket with a train symbol on the back. While examining the model further, Grissom found a second picture of the bloodied doll, again hidden. Later on the series, the model was connected to the others by the clue involving bleach; a coupon for bleach was found on the floor of the miniature. Trigger: On October 18, 2006, Penny Garden left a voice message on the killer's answering machine. In the message, Garden informed the killer that she was firing her for not bleaching the grout as she had ordered. This order was most likely the trigger that led to Garden's murder. In the background, one can hear the song (\\"Lollipop Lollipop\\" By The Chordettes) Penny listened to before she died, and the sound of her pouring a drink. Connections: Penny Garden was a member of the same train miniatures club as Ernie Dell, and was also connected to Lionel Dell (Ernie Dell's biological son) through her neighbor, who sold Penny Garden's drugs (medication) to Lionel to get cash for Penny. Raymundo Suarez In Loco Motives, Grissom and his team were brought to the scene of the murder of a janitor, found lying face-first in a basin of shallow water at a chicken processing plant. The basin, the CSIs learned, was a stun bath, used to paralyze chickens before killing them by putting an electric current through the water. When Raymundo landed in the water, he became paralyzed long enough to drown. A miniature of the stun room was found nearby, depicting Raymundo in his death position, lying face-first in the stun bath. After researching the chicken plant, the team learned that Izzy Delancy, mentioned above, had protested with a Public Service Announcement against the plant as part of his 'new leaf' act. While examining the model further, Grissom found a third picture of the bloodied doll, again hidden. After cross-referencing the workers at the plant, the PSA, and the murders, Grissom's team found a prime suspect: Ernie Dell. The team soon learned that he was part of the same train club as Penny Garden, linking him to all three murders. When they searched his home, they found an elaborate workshop for building miniature models, including a train set-up, depicting a scene of death and morbid destruction. As a SWAT team burst into Ernie's home, Grissom received a live webcam feed from Ernie himself. Ernie confesses to the murders before shooting himself in the head. Later in the series, in the episode Lab Rats, the model was connected to the others by the clue involving bleach; a barrel of bleach was found near the stun bath. Trigger: Natalie stated, when being asked if Raymundo touched her, that he had, but was most likely set off by the smell of bleach she said was on his hands. Connections: Raymundo worked at Mannleigh Chickens, the plant where Ernie Dell worked. Officer Kamen/Barbara Tallman Monster in the Box began with Grissom returning from a four-week sabbatical. As he opened up a package delivered to his office, he was shocked to find another miniature. Calling the team in immediately, he realized from a pre-dated newspaper in the model that the murder had yet to happen. On the cover of the mini newspaper was a fourth image of the bloodied doll. In the miniature, a Caucasian woman was found lying on her back on her couch, with a pillow. On the pillow were traces of her make-up, leading the CSI's to assume that she would be smothered to death with it. After a large hunt for buildings with similar features displayed on the model, they found one apartment building that matched. Rushing to the penthouse, they arrived in time to startle Barbara Tallman, a retired psychotherapist who was about to lie down for her daily nap, along with her cat. Warning her of her impending death, the team swapped Tallman with a decoy, an officer named Kamen. Waiting and watching, the team hoped to catch the killer, whom they assumed would enter the suite to suffocate Kamen. When nobody but Barbara's brother arrived, they decided to call off the stake-out. As they went to awaken Kamen, however, they were horrified to find her dead. An autopsy of both the miniature Barbara, as well as Officer Kamen, later revealed that the cause of death was carbon monoxide poisoning. Examining the suite and the miniature, Grissom and his team found a mechanism in Barbara's chimney, timed in advance to drop a can of powdered charcoal onto the fire and seal off the chimney flue. The smoke from the lit fire and charcoal would then produce enough carbon monoxide to poison and suffocate anyone in the room. The murder proved that Ernie Dell was not in fact the real Miniature Killer, but had taken the blame (and the bullet) for someone else. Looking over the model, Grissom found three more images of the bloody doll, each from a previous crime. Putting them under an ultraviolet light, Grissom found a message scrawled across them: \\"YOU WERE WRONG\\". Tallman was found dead in the same position the next morning, after refusing to have a guard spend the night. Her brother held a press conference, bringing the knowledge of the Miniature Killer to the public. CSI later found his DNA from tears on his sister's body, revealing that he was part of an assisted suicide. Tallman had tried to frame the Miniature Killer for her suicide, an opportunity to stop the advancing Parkinson's disease that Tallman was diagnosed with. Trigger: It is possible that the bleach used in the water in flower vases inside the apartment may have been the trigger, but it was not confirmed. Connections: Tallman used to do volunteer work at the halfway house where Lionel Dell once resided. Sara Sidle (survived) In the seventh season's finale, \\"Living Doll\\", Natalie Davis was finally revealed as the Miniature Killer. The CSI team was able to narrow down their suspects to her, and piece together her background before arresting her, but not before she kidnapped Sara Sidle. Natalie began her plot to capture Sara long before the event actually happened. She was witness at a crime scene of a car wreck, where she saw Grissom gently stroke Sara's arm; it was then she decided to take her revenge on Grissom for Ernie Dell's death. She managed to buy the wrecked car, and transported it to the desert. She then began making a miniature depicting Sara trapped beneath the car. The model of Sara showed her with her arm sticking out from beneath the car, still moving (there was a motor attached to the arm that she had bought just days before the event). Once finished, Natalie took the miniature and placed it in Grissom's office; a simple feat because she had been working at the CSI offices as a janitor. Once the miniature was placed, she waited for Sara in the parking garage. When Sara arrived at her car, Natalie tased her, tied her up, and put her in the trunk of her car before leaving the parking structure. Sara woke up and escaped her bindings before slipping into the back seat after removing the cushion. She attacked Natalie while she was driving, smashing Natalie's head through the driver's side window before jumping out of the slowing car. Winded, Sara was unable to move in time to escape from Natalie, who pulled up in the car, drugged Sara, and tied her up again. In the season eight premiere episode \\"Dead Doll\\" (Part two to the seventh-season finale \\"Living Doll\\"), Sara awoke to find her arm pinned under a red Mustang. Natalie left Sara to die as a severe rainstorm approached, with warnings of flash floods in the area. As the water rose, Sara managed to escape by using the rear-view mirror, and was left with the task of surviving in the middle of the desert following the storm. Trigger: She targeted Sara Sidle because she blamed Gil Grissom for taking her foster father Ernie Dell away from her, the person she loved the most. Natalie resolved to do the same to Grissom. Connections: Natalie provided cleaning services at the CSI offices for a month before committing her crime, she was employed by a company that held the contracts for all municipal buildings in the Las Vegas strip area. Previous suspects=Sven Delancy The first person suspected to be the Miniature Killer was Sven Delancy, Izzy Delancy's son by his first wife. Sven had been in therapy twice a week since he was six years old because of a rough life living between two households with a father he did not get along with and a \\"cokehead mother\\" as said by Izzy's current wife. He first drew suspicion after his mother revealed he had an interest in architecture and that he could draw nearly perfect 3-D renderings of skyscrapers. During interrogation, it was suggested that Sven had channeled his anger at his father through the miniature found at the crime scene. When shown pictures of the miniature, however, the boy fainted at the sight of the real blood in the miniature. To make sure that Sven was not pretending to be repulsed as he was by the sight of blood, a test was run on him, which involved artificially increasing the flow of adrenaline through his system to simulate his seeing blood. Sven fainted once again, proving his innocence. The crime lab was left with no more leads for some time afterwards. Ernie Dell Ernest Edward \\"Ernie\\" Dell became the prime suspect after he was linked to the first three murders through employment records and club memberships. Upon investigating Ernie's home, numerous models were found, making it clearer that he could be the Miniature Killer. Ernie was taken into custody but was released since there was not enough evidence to charge him. After being interrogated by the CSI's, Ernie left a message on the killer's answering machine, telling her that he saw her models, and knew that she was the killer before stating that he was heading over to talk. After Ernie killed himself, the CSI team discovered that he had only been covering for someone else. Lionel Dell/Mitchell Douglas Searching through old videos, the team learned that Ernie had a son who'd changed his name from Lionel Dell to Mitchell Douglas. The CSIs assumed that he could be the killer. However, they soon learned that Ernie's son despised his father, and that Ernie seemed to love his adopted children more. Upon learning of his fostering of children, the CSIs learned from a video tape that Ernie had at least thirteen foster kids, any one of which could be the Miniature Killer. The CSIs managed to slowly narrow down the list after tracking numerous of the Dell foster children down, some of whom had died over the years. After epithelials were discovered on a fingerprint of one of the miniature dolls made by the Miniature Killer, the CSI team learned that the killer was female, narrowing down the list of children further. Grissom's involvement Of all the CSIs, Gil Grissom has been the most involved with the case. Grissom keeps each of the miniatures locked up in his office for observation. Grissom also witnessed Ernie Dell's suicide, and was one of the first to pronounce the case closed. He was shocked when the next miniature was delivered directly to him. In the episode \\"Lab Rats,\\" Hodges mentioned to the other lab technicians that he heard Grissom was losing sleep over the case. One of the techs, Wendy Simms, questioned Sara about this, and Sara's response was, \\"How would I know?\\" (In this episode it is Hodges who realizes the bleach connection between all four victims). At the end of \\"Leapin' Lizards,\\" Grissom was seen assembling a miniature of his own, which appeared to be of his own office. When asked by a concerned Catherine why he made it in \\"The Good, the Bad, and the Dominatrix\\", he replied that it was to keep his hands busy. It was later revealed that he was making it to connect to an online community that thrived on miniatures, where he could ask questions about custom-made items used in the killer's miniatures. When the Miniature Killer was discovered to be Natalie Davis, Grissom was the first to talk to her in the interrogation room after Brass suggested dripping bleach on himself until she spoke. Grissom went in alone, and attempted to get her to tell him where Sara was by complimenting her work and asking what she thought of his miniature. When Sara's name was brought up following her kidnapping, Natalie became very angry, to the point that she had a hallucination of her slitting Grissom's throat with a razor, while she was actually falling into an unresponsive state in which she sang \\"I've Got a Pain in My Sawdust\\" to herself, leaving Sara's whereabouts unknown. Upon learning from the weather forecast that three severe rainstorms were due to hit Las Vegas, Grissom simulated the effect the resulting flash floods would have on Sara's location by pouring water on the miniature of the crime scene. The water quickly pooled over the Sara doll, and its arm stopped moving. After investigating numerous clues left behind, Grissom and the team located the car, only to find it buried deep in sand from the storm. Sara's vest was found buried, but she had since escaped from the wreckage. The team then scoured the desert to find her. Nick was the first to find Sara, who had collapsed in the heat. Though initially unresponsive, Sara regained consciousness as she was being MEDEVACed out, looking up at a relieved Grissom. Natalie appeared in the season 9 episode, \\"Woulda, Coulda, Shoulda\\". Grissom attended her hearing, where it was decided that she was to be transferred to another jail, and to no longer receive therapy, as it was decided that therapeutic treatment had been successful. She expressed to Grissom the belief that she had changed and that she felt remorse for her actions, and that \\"people who do bad things need to be punished.\\" After she is taken out, Grissom inspects a loose floor tile in her cell, lifting it up to find a miniature of Natalie hanging from the bottom by its neck, thus suggesting she still plans to hang herself, as per her original plan. She is also shown working with bleach, as a way to conquer her fear of it and the psychotic impulses it brings out within her.

Crafted by set designer Rob Sissman, each crime scene was actually three separate creations. Sissman designed the life-sized set and then created two miniature replicas. The prop that was used by the actors on the show was a half-inch-scale model of the original set. High definition cameras were used to capture close shots of the third model, which was a one-inch-scale. It took Sissman hours to duplicate the details for each scene and he said that the \\"season was exhausting.\\" *The first letter of each method of killing spells bleach, which was the killer's trigger: **(B)lunt Force Trauma **(L)iquid Nicotine poisoning **(E)lectrocution **(A)sphyxiation **(C)rushing **(H)anging - unclear if she actually followed through with this one.

Oberon saw the introduction to English Renaissance theatre of scenic techniques that became standard for dramatic productions through the coming centuries. The text of the masque was first published in the initial folio collection of Jonson's works that appeared in 1616. The show Oberon was performed on 1 January 1611 at Whitehall Palace, in the Banqueting Hall. Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, the son and then- heir of James I, took the title role. (Prince Henry had wanted to stage the masque on horseback, but \\"his father vetoed the Idea.\\")Michael Leapman, Inigo: The Troubled Life of Inigo Jones, Architect of the English Renaissance London, Headline Book Publishing, 2003; pp. 115-16. The masque was the sixth in the series of extravagant shows that Jonson and Jones produced for the Stuart Court in the Christmas holiday season, a series that had begun with The Masque of Blackness in 1605 and had continued through the previous year's Prince Henry's Barriers (The Lady of the Lake). In Oberon, Jones delivered another installment of the spectacle that the English Court had come to expect. The masque began with a front curtain displaying a map of the British Isles, which was drawn to reveal a large rock or crag, lit by a moon that passed through the sky above. Perched on the crag, surrounded by satyrs and nymphs, an unusually sober and sagelike Silenus prophesied the arrival of the fairy prince, Oberon, who would bestow order and beneficent rule. The nymphs and satyrs danced joyfully at the news. The crag split open to display a palatial hall, furnished with a throne lit with multi-colored lights. The \\"Knights Masquers\\" were revealed, and the Prince of Wales entered, riding in a chariot drawn by two \\"white bears.\\" (Two polar bears captured in the Arctic in 1609 were kept by Philip Henslowe and Edward Alleyn as part of their bear-baiting operation at the Beargarden, and may have been tame enough in 1611 to use in the staging of Oberon.)Teresa Grant, \\"White Bears in Mucedorus, The Winter's Tale, and Oberon, the Faery Prince,\\" Notes and Queries 48 (Sept. 2001), pp. 311-13. The men wore black masks and costumes of silver and gold. The praises of Henry and James were sung by a boys' choir accompanied by ten lutenists, and ten pages in green and silver danced, followed by the dance of the fourteen principal masquers; then Oberon/Henry led his mother Anne of Denmark in the general dancing that concluded the performance. The masque was coupled with a performance at \\"barriers,\\" a stylized physical combat (like a joust without horses); but no specific information on that part of the festivity has survived. Apart from that lack, however, the extant documentation on this masque is richer than for many others of the era--which has allowed scholars to study specific aspects of its creation, notably its music.Peter Walls, Music in the English Courtly Masque, 1604-1640, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1996. Scenery The masque saw Jones's introduction of two techniques of scenery construction to English stagecraft. \\"Sidewings\\" are pieces of painted canvas that stand along the sides of the stage, resembling partial backdrops; they can be deployed in multiple pairs arranged for perspective effects. \\"Shutters\\" are painted backcloths split down the center, that can be slid in or out from the wings. Shutters, like sidewings, can be deployed in multiple sets; their use allows varied changes of scenic backdrop.Leapman, p. 81. (Such scenery was used in masques during the Stuart era; considerations of cost and practicality generally kept scenery out of the professional theatre of Shakespeare and his successors until the Restoration period.) Costs Surviving financial records regarding Oberon indicate that the costumes alone cost ¬£1412.Leapman, p. 117. The Exchequer accounts show that Jonson and Jones earned their standard fees of ¬£40 each, though Jones received an additional ¬£16 from Prince Henry's household budget; Ferrabosco earned ¬£20 for his music.E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 3, pp. 385-6. Influences It has been widely recognized that Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale shows the influence of Oberon, necessitating the conclusion that the play was written or at least completed after the January 1611 performance of the masque. The main signs of influence in Shakespeare's play are the bear in III,iii and the dance at the sheepshearing in IV,iv, which resembles the dance of satyrs in the masque.Mary Chan, Music in the Theatre of Ben Jonson, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1980; p. 307. Oberon presents a significant demonstration of the influence that the masques of the era had on the commercial theatre of Shakespeare and his compatriots; \\"the bears in Mucedorus, Oberon, and The Winter's Tale were all connected....\\"Melissa D. Aaron, Global Economics, Newark, DE, University of Delaware Press, 2005; p. 216. Thomas Arne and George Colman the Elder also used the work as the basis for their masque The Fairy Prince, which premiered at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden on 12 November 1771.John A. Parkinson: \\"The Fairy Prince\\", Grove Music Online ed. L. Macy (Accessed 17 February 2009), (subscription access) Modern production An extremely rare modern production of Oberon, the Faery Prince was staged in Cleveland, Ohio in 1993, organized by personnel from Case Western Reserve University and Cleveland State University. The production, based on surviving stage designs and music, supplemented with adaptations of Jacobean songs and choreography, was recorded and released on videotape and DVD.

As of 2010, they were the longest-tenured club to be based in the Jackson metropolitan area. For their entire sixteen seasons of existence, they competed in the Texas League as the Class AA affiliate of the New York Mets, until the club moved to Williamsport, Pennsylvania for the 1991 season and then to Binghamton, New York, for the 1992 season. Early Years in Jackson The Jackson Mets came into existence in 1974 when the New York Mets moved their AA club, the Victoria Toros, after only one year in Victoria, Texas. Civic leaders in Jackson had mounted a campaign to build a new stadium for a minor-league club. At the time, Jackson had not fielded a club since the Jackson Senators last played in the Class C Cotton States League in 1953. Previous minor-league teams based in Jackson had played downtown at a field on the Mississippi State Fairgrounds, but the new park, which would be named Smith-Wills Stadium, was constructed on Lakeland Drive just east of Interstate 55 in the more suburban area of northeast Jackson. When the team opened play in 1975, the park still had no lights, an unpaved parking lot, no roof on its press box, and was temporarily locating its club offices in a trailer. In their first few years in Jackson, the Mets drew an average of 1,600 fans a game. Ed Kneip was the Jackson Mets original general manager, helping to lead the charge to bring the team to Jackson. 1976 and 1977 were the only two years the Jackson Mets recorded losing records for the entire season until 1988. The 1980s During the 1980s, the Jackson Mets emerged as one of the preeminent clubs in the Texas League. The team made the playoffs nine times between 1978 and 1987, including eight consecutive trips, and appeared in seven Texas League Championship Series, including five in row from 1983-87. They won three Texas League titles, in 1981, 1984, and 1985. Fans in Jackson responded to the team's success: more than 112,000 people flocked to Smith-Wills Stadium in 1981, the year that future big-league manager Davey Johnson piloted the Jackson Mets to their first Eastern Division title. Continued winning seasons by the Mets kept attendance above the 100,000 mark for the next six years. Several future Major-League players spent part of their minor-league careers as Jackson Mets. The 1984 championship squad included Billy Beane, who hit 20 home runs, and Lenny Dykstra, who stole 53 bases. The Mets pitching staff was anchored by Calvin Schiraldi, who went 14-3, and also featured Rick Aguilera, Roger McDowell, Jay Tibbs, and Floyd Youmans. The 1985 team that repeated as champs was led by Dave Magadan, Randy Milligan, Mark Carreon, and Barry Lyons, all of whom hit over .300. In addition, at various points the Mets fielded future major-leaguers Lee Mazzilli, Mike Scott, Jeff Reardon, Hubie Brooks, Darryl Strawberry, Kevin Mitchell, Terry Blocker, John Gibbons and Kevin Elster. Move At the close of the 1990 season, the Mets organization announced their desire to move the Jackson Mets closer to the parent club. And so, the team's affiliation was moved to Binghamton, New York, where it became the Binghamton Mets in the Eastern League. For the 1991 season, the Houston Astros relocated their AA affiliate to Jackson. This team would be named the Jackson Generals (now located in Corpus Christi, Texas; not the same as the present Southern League team in Tennessee) in a contest, the winning moniker representing General Andrew Jackson, the military army officer who later became President of the United States and for whom the city of Jackson is named.

This caused serious noise pollution for nearby residents. A night curfew from night to about 7:00 in the early morning also hindered operations.

Background North Hagerstown High School opened in 1956 at the old Potomac Avenue location after the founding of South Hagerstown High School. The present location of the school on Pennsylvania Avenue was opened in 1958. The former mascot was the Little Heiskell, however the mascot is now a Hub. North's mascot stems from the historical and geographical location of Hagerstown at the intersection of waterways, railroads, and interstate highways. Major highways intersect within the city, including Interstate 70 and Interstate 81.

He attended Pennsylvania State University. Richards began his career as a meteorologist at WATE-TV in Knoxville, Tennessee before leaving to join The Weather Channel in Atlanta. While at WATE, he earned the Seal of Approval from the American Meteorological Society. Because of the Weather Channel's connection to its founder John Coleman, former chief meteorologist and weather forecaster for ABC's Good Morning America, Richards occasionally filled in on that show's morning broadcasts. Later he moved on to the short-lived Satellite News Channel, before joining KSDK in 1983. Richards' death resulted from a plane crash, which is thought to have been suicide due to his anxiety over an alleged extra-marital affair that was increasingly becoming public knowledge. After a radio interview with his former girlfriend, who provided messages he had left on her phone answering machine, aired on The Steve and DC Morning Show, Richards was despondent. On the night of March 23, 1994, Richards took off from Spirit of St. Louis Airport in Chesterfield, Missouri, and flew his plane, a Piper Cherokee into the ground.

Originally active from 1978 to 1981, then reuniting to perform in July 2006 through to November 2012. After a three-year hiatus, Pointed Sticks returned to the stage in June 2015 for shows on Vancouver island as well as the July 11th Khatsahlano street party in Vancouver (sporadic live appearances have continued into 2016). The band is known for their fast melodic pop music and liberal use of harmony singing by all five members‚Äîalso for unusual graphic images that acted as counterpoint to the music. They were the first Canadian band signed to Stiff Records, although the label was going through financial problems and never released an album by the band. The original band consisted of vocalist Nick Jones, guitarist Bill Napier-Hemy,great-grandson of English painter Charles Napier Hemy (1841-1917) (whose last name is not hyphenated) bassist Tony Bardach and drummer Ian Tiles. Keyboard player Gord Nicholl joined soon after. Johnny Ferreira later joined on saxophone, Bardach was replaced by Scott Watson on bass, and Tiles was replaced by drummer Robert Bruce (from Active Dog), and later by Ken \\"Dimwit\\" Montgomery (who was also known for stints in the Subhumans and D.O.A.). The band released four singles, (including their only Stiff records release, a 3-song 7\\") before releasing their first full-length album, Perfect Youth in 1980. Members of the band were featured in Dennis Hopper's 1980 film, Out of the Blue. The first compilation of their recordings was released in 1995 on Zulu Records. Part Of The Noise, now out of print, included five songs from the Perfect Youth album as well as 45's and rarities. In 2005, the complete Perfect Youth album, with four bonus tracks, was reissued by Sudden Death Records, followed the next year by a compilation of singles, outtakes, and other rarities, entitled Waiting for the Real Thing, also on Sudden Death. These two releases do not share or repeat any tracks. The original band members reunited in 2006 for a tour of Japan, and continued to play sporadic concerts in Canada and the United States. In 2009 the band recorded an album of all new material, Three Lefts Make A Right, released November 1 of that year on Northern Electric records. The band returned to Japan in August 2010 with support from a re-united Dishrags, their all female contemporaries from the original Vancouver Punk scene. Pointed Sticks participated in a Vancouver benefit concert for Japan earthquake relief on May 12, 2011. \\"Three Lefts Make a Right\\" was mixed by Vancouver's Mike Fraser. The complete Stiff Sessions recordings were released on CD in Japan in 2008, on the Base label.

It is a dramatization of the life of Holocaust concentration camp survivor Gisella Perl and is based on her book I Was a Doctor in Auschwitz. Plot Gisella Perl (Christine Lahti), a Jewish- Hungarian gynecologist from Sighetul Marmatiei, Romania, testifies before an Immigration & Naturalization Service (INS) review board consisting of three men (Bruce Davison, Richard Crenna, and Beau Bridges). Perl is seeking to be granted citizenship after passing the New York State Medical Licensing Board examinations, wishing to begin practicing in New York. She recounts her early life when she aspired to be a doctor despite the admonishments of her father, her time practicing as a gynecologist before the German invasion, and her experiences as prisoner #25404, where she provided what medical care she could to fellow prisoners. Her most controversial actions included providing late- term abortions to pregnant women in order to save their lives. These pregnant women would otherwise have been killed immediately or subjected to the torture of horrific \\"medical\\" experiments. Perl is accused of \\"colluding\\" with the Nazi doctor Josef Mengele who directed experiments on pregnant female inmates at the Auschwitz concentration camp. As the review board questions her over several days, she becomes increasingly emotional and questions her own determination to survive, as well as her guilt at having lived while so many others did not. She testifies that despite her intention to keep herself and others alive, she unknowingly became part of the Nazi efforts to kill, but she held on to the hope that the lives of the women she saved would undermine the efforts of the Nazis to exterminate the Jewish race. After she is granted citizenship and begins to practice in New York, she gets a call to attend one of the women whose first baby she had aborted in the camp. She delivers the baby and sees her wish that the Jewish race will survive fulfilled.IMDb Plot summary  Cast  *Christine Lahti as Gisella Perl *Beau Bridges as Herman Prentiss *Richard Crenna as Jake Smith *Bruce Davison as Peter Schuman *Jonathan Cake as Dr. Mengele *Zoie Palmer as Didi Goldstein *Jolyon Baker as Frederick Krauss *Jessica Beitchman as Marta Weiss *Oliver Cotton as Moshe Perl *Michelle Fine as Fanny Perl *Maria Ricossa as Esther Jacob *Ingrid Veninger as Zozia *Emma Wellbelove as Young Gisella *Nina Young as Irma Grese * as David Perl *Inga Tuminiene as Cilla Perl *Adrija Cepaite-Palsauskiene as Rose Perl *Inga Maskarina as Helen Perl *Nola Augustson as Sarah Goldstein *Alan Jordan as Isaac Goldstein *Judah Katz as Dr. Jonas Ruben *Monika Biciunaite as Dr. Ruth Stern *Viola Kilimciauskaite as Katya Weiss *Kristina Mauruseviciute as Leitu *Getter Kosolov as Young Cilla Perl *Aurelija Pasmuntaite as Young Rose Perl *Joonas Suokko as Young David Perl *Elena Stonciute as Young Helen Perl *Sara Jessica Karimjee as Hannah Mary Lal References External links  2003 television films 2003 films American biographical drama films American films 2003 biographical drama films Films based on biographies Films about the aftermath of the Holocaust Showtime (TV network) films Films directed by Joseph Sargent Films scored by Charles Bernstein Cultural depictions of Josef Mengele 2003 drama films ","title":"Out of the Ashes (2003 film)"},{"id":"9570814","text":"Countess Ana Katarina Zrinska (c. 1625‚Äì1673) was a Croatian noblewoman and poet, born into the House of Frankopan noble family. She married Count Petar Zrinski of the House of Zrinski in 1641 and later became known as Katarina Zrinska. She is remembered in Croatia as a patron of the arts, a writer and patriot. She died in obscurity in a monastery in Graz following the downfall of the Zrinski-Frankopan conspiracy in 1671 and the execution of both her husband Petar Zrinski and her brother Fran Krsto Frankopan. Her most notable literary work is Putni tovaru≈°, written 1660 at her estates in Ozalj. Katarina Zrinski and the conspiracy were largely forgotten until the 1860s, when Croatian politician Ante Starƒçeviƒá began a campaign to rehabilitate the Zrinski and Frankopan nobility, and the story of her life and death was widely popularised following the publishing of Eugen Kumiƒçiƒá's historical novel Urota Zrinsko-Frankopanska () in 1893. In the early 20th century, and especially after World War I, numerous Croatian women's associations were founded bearing her name. In 1999 the Croatian National Bank issued a silver commemorative coin depicting Katarina Zrinski, in their Znamenite Hrvatice () series, along with children's writer Ivana Brliƒá-Ma≈æuraniƒá and painter Slava Ra≈°kaj. Biography=Early life Katarina was born in Bosiljevo near the modern city of Karlovac in present-day Croatia to Vuk Krsto Frankopan of the House of Frankopan, a well-known commander (general) and nobleman in the Croatian Military Frontier (which was an autonomous region carved out of the Kingdom of Croatia within the Austrian Empire) and his second wife Ur≈°ula Inhofer. Fran Krsto Frankopan, also a notable nobleman, was her half brother, produced in Vuk Krsto's third marriage to Dora Haller. She was homeschooled in her youth, and learned German during her childhood years (as it was her mother's first language) along with Hungarian, Latin and Italian which she was later taught. In 1641 she married the Croatian nobleman Petar Zrinski in Karlovac, who later went on to become Ban (viceroy) of Croatia following his brother Nikola Zrinski's death in 1664. After marrying Petar the pair spent most of their time at Ozalj Castle, the family residence. In 1660 she wrote a prayer book titled Putni tovaru≈°, and had it printed in 1661 in the Republic of Venice before presenting it as a gift to the 17th century Croatian lexicographer Ivan Belostenec (the book was later re-printed in 1687 and 1715 in Ljubljana and then again in 2005 in ƒåakovec). Children Portrait of Jelena Zrinski Katarina and Petar had four children, born between 1643 and 1658: *Jelena (1643 ‚Äì 18 February 1703) Known as Jelena Zrinska in Croatia and Ilona Zr√≠nyi in Hungary, she married Hungarian nobleman Francis I R√°k√≥czi in 1666. After his death in 1676, she married her second husband Imre Th√∂k√∂ly, a Hungarian statesman and Prince of Transylvania, in 1682. She was also mother to Francis II R√°k√≥czi, leader of the Hungarian uprising against the Habsburgs in the early 18th century. In her later years she spent 7 years interned in an Ursuline convent in Austria before being exiled to Turkey in 1699 where she died four years later in 1703. *Judita Petronela (1652‚Äì1699) One of the two Katarina's daughters who spent the majority of their adult life in convents, Judita died as a nun in a Poor Clares convent in Zagreb. *Ivan IV Antun Baltazar (26 August 1654 ‚Äì 11 November 1703) In Croatia known as Ivan Antun Zrinski, he was the pair's only son. After a short military career demonstrating his loyalty to the State, he was later charged with high treason by the Austrian authorities. He was imprisoned first at Rattenberg in Tyrol and then at Grazer Schlo√überg, where he spent the last 20 years of his life. He eventually went insane and died in 1703. *Aurora Veronika (1658 ‚Äì 19 January 1735) The pair's youngest child and the last surviving member of the once powerful House of Zrinski. Following the crackdown on the Zrinski- Frankopan conspiracy (see below), she accompanied her mother during her internment at a Dominican convent in Graz. Aurora later spent her whole life as a nun and eventually died in an Ursuline convent in Klagenfurt. Zrinski- Frankopan conspiracy Following the unpopular Peace of Vasv√°r treaty signed in 1664 by the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy and the Ottoman Empire which gave back parts of the territory which had been liberated from the Turks in the preceding Austro-Turkish War (1663‚Äì1664), a conspiracy involving members of the Croatian and Hungarian nobility was formed to overthrow the Habsburgs. The leaders of the conspiracy were Katarina's husband Petar Zrinski, her half brother Fran Krsto Frankopan and the Hungarian count Ferenc Wessel√©nyi. The conspiracy was largely unsuccessful and in March 1670 a crackdown ordered by Leopold I ensued, in which all three men were arrested and imprisoned. On 30 April 1671 both Petar and Fran Krsto were executed in Wiener Neustadt. On the eve of his execution, her husband wrote her a farewell letter: The downfall of the conspiracy practically destroyed the House of Zrinski as their enormous property was either confiscated or plundered. Katarina was first arrested and imprisoned in Bruck an der Mur and then ordered into seclusion by the Vienna court. She spent the remaining years of her life in a Dominican convent in Graz with her daughter Aurora Veronika, where she died on 16 November 1673. Legacy=1860s‚Äì1940s Croatian politician Ante Starƒçeviƒá is considered the first person who initiated a campaign to politically rehabilitate leaders of the conspiracy in the speech he gave on 26 July 1861 in the Croatian Parliament. The speech spurred renewed interest in the whole affair and anniversaries of Petar Zrinski and Fran Krsto Frankopan's deaths started to be commemorated publicly in growing numbers, with increasingly political overtones, as Croatian politicians became vocal in their calls for greater Croatian independence (which was at the time still part of Austria-Hungary). In the 1880s a committee was even founded with the purpose of transporting their remains from Wiener Neustadt to Croatia, and in 1893 writer and politician Eugen Kumiƒçiƒá published a historical novel titled Urota Zrinsko- Frankopanska (), which helped to further popularise the image of Zrinkis and Frankopans as Croatian patriots and martyrs for freedom. The bones of conspiracy leaders were eventually transferred back to Croatia in 1919 by the Brethren of the Croatian Dragon and were greeted by masses upon their return to Zagreb. By that time Katarina Zrinski also came to be seen as the greatest Croatian woman of the past and a symbol of patriotism for women in Croatia. In the years before World War I many women's societies sprung up around the country as well as in the Croatian diaspora. The oldest such association bearing Katarina's name was founded in 1914 in Punta Arenas in Chile. It was originally called Hrvatska ≈æena () and was primarily interested in keeping the Croatian language alive and helping Croatian women cope with life far from home. However, soon after WWI broke out, the society was actively engaged in helping the Pan-Slavic Yugoslav movement and was thus renamed JNO Katarina Zrinska. In North America the Kƒáeri Katarine Zrinjske () society was formed in 1917 which even had a youth branch in Youngstown, Ohio. In 1919 the Katarina Zrinjska women's association was formed in Karlovac, the first association bearing her name in Croatia. The society was designed as an organisation of middle class Croatian Catholic women in the area, and they claimed they chose to be named after Katarina because \\"strictly adhered to Christian principles throughout her life\\". The proclaimed goal of the society was to \\"encourage members to be good Catholics, honest citizens, women of significance, model mothers, advanced housekeepers and apostles of all things good\\", which they hoped to achieve by organising picnics, concerts, education classes, fundraisers, lectures, etc. In 1920 a similar Dru≈°tvo Hrvatica Katarine grofice Zrinjski was established in Zagreb and in 1930 another one was founded in Petrinja. All these societies were active until the early 1940s, but were eventually disbanded in May 1943 by a decree issued by the fascist government of Independent State of Croatia. 1990s‚Äìpresent The women's societies of the past and their work were largely forgotten during the SFR Yugoslavia period (1945‚Äì1990), until the modern-day Zajednica ≈æena Katarina Zrinska () was founded in 1999 in Split, as the centre-right Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) party's women's branch. Other associations abroad carrying her name include Hrvatska ≈æena ‚Äì Katarina Zrinska in Adelaide, Australia (est. 1974), H≈†KD Croatia Katarina Zrinski in Gothenburg, Sweden, and many others. Many streets and squares around Croatia are named after her, including the Katarinin trg () in the Upper Town part of Zagreb, located next to the Jesuit church of St. Catherine's built between 1620 and 1632 in the baroque style. Many schools and institutions are also named after her. In 1999 the Croatian National Bank issued a 200 kuna silver commemorative coin with Katarina Zrinski as part of their \\"Famous Croatian Women\\" series. In their press release the bank described Katarina as \\"a writer, ardent patriot and a martyr, as well as a spiritual initiator of the liberation movement against foreign rule\\".

It is one of the largest and busiest airports on the Bird's Head Peninsula. It replaced a smaller, former World War II airfield, Jefman Airport on the island of Jefman. The airport is named after Domine Eduard Osok, a pastor originating from Sorong and known for doing missionary works and spreading Christianity in Sorong and the surrounding parts. Domine Eduard Osok Airport serves as one of the entry point to the Raja Ampat Islands, since Raja Ampat Islands are closer to the city of Sorong, compared to the provincial capital Manokwari. However, Marinda Airport which is located within the Raja Ampat Islands has started operating, therefore this airport no longer serves as the main entry point. The movement of aircraft in one of the busiest and largest airports on the Bird's Head Peninsula is experiencing an average growth of 3.3% annually. Noted, there are more than 9,000 aircraft movements per year. In terms of passengers, the average annual passenger growth reaches 13.2% where in 2014 there are about 500,000 more passengers. For cargo, the average cargo growth per year is quite rapid at around 17.2%. As an airport feeder, Domine Eduard Osok Airport serves domestic scheduled services operated by several airlines including Garuda Indonesia, Sriwijaya Air and Xpress Air. In addition, the airport also serves pioneer destinations which are operated by Susi Air to some surrounding areas such as Ayawasi, Inawatan, Teminabuan, and Waisai. With a length of 2,500 meters and 45 meters wide, this airport runway can be landed by aircraft like Boeing 737 series and the Airbus A320.  History  Until 2004, Jefman Airport serves as the main airport of Sorong. However, the airport is suffering from overcapacity and cannot be expanded due to lack of land. Moreover, due to only having a single 1,650 m runway, the airport can only accommodate small aircraft such as the Fokker 28. Furthermore, to go to Sorong, passengers still needs to travel by boat from the airport which was very time-consuming. To solve this issue, the government decided to build a new airport to replace the obsolete Jefman Airport. Construction is finished on 2004 and Jefman Airport is now closed. In August 2019, the airport was damaged by violent protesters following large-scale protests in Papua.  Development  In 2013, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation allocated IDR 50 billion ($5.1 million) for runway width expansion to 45 meters from the 0 meters. Due to overcapacity, the government has lengthened the runway to 2,500 m from 1,950 m so that the airport can accommodate Boeing 737 and Airbus A320.Runway Bandara DEO Diperpanjang 300 Meter Expansion of the airport commenced from 2011 and finished in 2016. The expansion includes construction of passenger terminal building into 2 floors, installation of two new jet bridge and fixed bridge, baggage handling system, terminal lift, luggage x-ray and multi view cabin, walk through metal detector, and addition of other facilities such as concession area and interior terminal design update. In that period, the total APBN budget used is about 236 billion rupiah. Of course the budget used is commensurate with the benefits gained for the city of Sorong. With the airport built more modern and magnificent, it is expected that air transportation services in the city of Sorong and surrounding areas are increasing. That way, Domine Eduard Osok airport as the gateway of Sorong city can become a booster for Eastern Indonesia to continue growing. The new terminal was inaugurated by President Joko Widodo and Transportation Minister Ignatius Jonan, On the other side, the navigation facility will be improved in the future. AirNav Sorong also seeks to optimize the instrument landing system (ILS) to assist the landing. This would allow aircraft to land at the airport with ease and also allows the airport to serve night flights. AirNav Sorong is also currently installing a billing data system (BDS) and a billing cash system (BCS). The renovation of the air traffic control tower that was damaged due to an earthquake will also be part of the improvement of the airport's navigation system.
