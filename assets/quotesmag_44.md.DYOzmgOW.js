Located at the junction of Vermont Route 122 and Sutton Road, it includes the town common, town hall, and cemetery. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. Description and history The village center of the town of Wheelock is located in its northeastern corner, stretching along Vermont Route 122 south of the Miller's Run river. At the eastern end of the linear village, Sutton Road (Town Highway 17) branches northeast, while Route 122 bends more southeast to follow the river. The town common is a quarter- acre grassy area on the east side of this junction; it is a roughly semicircular area bounded on the south by Route 122 and the north by the drive providing access to the town hall. It is shaded by pine trees, and has two benches, a bandstand, and the town's 1915 memorial to its American Civil War participants. Across Route 122 from the common is the cemetery, about 3/4 acre in size, also shaded by pine trees. The earliest dated grave is from 1827, although two people who died earlier have since been reinterred there. The town hall stands north of the common; it is a 1-1/2 story Greek Revival gable- roofed building with a square belfry. with The town of Wheelock was chartered in 1785 as a land grant to Dartmouth College and the Moor's Indian Charity School, both founded by Eleazer Wheelock, for whom the town is named. The town was managed for many years as a tenancy by Dartmouth, a relationship that did not fully end until the 1970s, when the college divested itself of all remaining land in the town. Its original town hall was located in the Wheelock Hollow area in the south of the town, but the cemetery was established in the village by 1827, and formally deeded to the town in 1860. The move to build a new town hall in the village in 1871 was spurred at least in part by an attempt to develop local mineral springs as a tourist draw. The Baptist church was moved to stand next to it in 1880, and a schoolhouse was also located facing the common. Both of these buildings were demolished in the 20th century due to deteriorating condition. The town hall, also deteriorating, was moved onto a new foundation in the 1970s, providing space for the town offices in the basement.

The creek flows through both farmland and rural neighborhoods: \\"Passenger Creek, confluence with Red River is in sight [of a home (885 Passenger Creek Rd, Adams, TN 37010) located in Brad Bury Farms - a neighborhood ~12.3 miles from Downtown Clarksville, TN]\\". In 2010, during the \\"Great Flood of 2010 - Clarksville, TN\\", Passenger Creek rose tremendously. The topography of Adams, Tennessee, and Clarksville, Tennessee, does not consist of many large creeks and rivers like the Ozarks do in Missouri and Arkansas. This area has large hills and few creeks. Thus, when rain falls, the water is collected at the bases of these hills and then transferred to the few creeks and rivers there are in the area. With an immense surface area feeding these few creeks like Passenger Creek, the water levels rise higher than one would expect. This is the same process that occurred in 2010. In this situation, The Passenger Creek, along with the Coon Creek (a smaller creek that feeds water into Passenger Creek from the south) fed into the Red River which then fed into the Cumberland River and devastated much of Clarksville's Riverside Drive: \\"The May 2010 flood resulted in over $36 million in damages in Montgomery County\\".

Here, arrowheads and several hand-made stone items have been found.

Crosscheck was developed in 2005 by Kansas Secretary of State Ron Thornburgh in conjunction with Iowa, Missouri, and Nebraska. In December 2019, the program was suspended indefinitely as part of a settlement of a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas challenging Kansas' management of the program. Prior to Crosscheck's legally mandated suspension, a dozen states had withdrawn from the program citing the inaccurate data and risk of violating voters' privacy rights. Crosscheck was also accused of facilitating unlawful purges of voters in a racially discriminatory manner. History Crosscheck was initiated in December 2005Thornburgh signs four-state agreement at the Midwest Election Officials Conference (MEOC) by the office of the Kansas Secretary of State in coordination with Iowa, Missouri and Nebraska. The program combined each state's voter rolls into a database and sought to identify potential duplicate registrations by comparing first name, last name, and full date of birth. In 2006, the first crosscheck was conducted using voter registration records from Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, and Nebraska. In 2017, the last Crosscheck was conducted with records from 28 states. The program was administered by the office of the Kansas Secretary of StateInterstate Crosscheck Program Grows as a free service to all member states. Under then-Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, the program expanded rapidly from thirteen states in 2010 to a peak of 29 states in 2014. In 2017, Crosscheck analyzed 98 million voter registration records from 28 states and returned 7.2 million \\"potential duplicate registrant\\" records to member states. Accuracy  Crosscheck considered two voter registrations potential duplicates if they matched on first name, last name, and full date of birth even if the last four digits of the social security number (SSN4) of the two records did not match, or when one or both SSN4 were missing. Matching based on first name, last name, and date of birth \\"fails for practically all common American names\\" according to ID Analytics analysis of a database of over 300 million unique records. Crosscheck's use of loose matching standards lead to a high rate false positives: pairs of voter registration records lacking a match on SSN4 but who are identified as \\"potential duplicate registrants\\" by Crosscheck. Although false positives created a myriad of issues, the Kansas Secretary of State's office did not publicly release the percentage of their widely publicized \\"potential duplicate registrants\\" which were false positives. Independent researchers point to public data from Virginia's 2013 Annual Report on List Maintenance] which documented a 75% false positive rate.https://www.elections.virginia.gov/Files/maintenance- reports/2013SBEListMaintenancereport.pdf For voters and member states, misidentification can be costly. Each voter who is misidentified faces an incremental privacy risk when their personally identifying information is exported to at least one state beyond his or her state of residence, and the registrant risks being inappropriately inactivated or removed from voter rolls. In Ada County, Idaho, election officials relied on Crosscheck's list of \\"potential duplicate registrants\\" to mistakenly remove 766 voters. None were duplicate registrants. To avoid inappropriate deletion of eligible voters as occurred in Ada County, member states invested in extensive processing to vet each Crosscheck record. In May 2018, the New Hampshire Secretary of State's office reported that 817 work hours over nearly a year were required to process the 2017 Crosscheck results for their state. Despite that intensive effort, staff found no evidence of widespread double voting. Similarly, Virginia's 2015 Annual List Maintenance Report stated \\"the Crosscheck program does not have a direct fee associated with it, however, the initial data received from Crosscheck requires significant agency handling to determine what data is usable and what data is not usable. Crosscheck data is prone to false positives since the initial matching is only conducted using first name, last name, and date of birth. The need to greatly refine and analyze Crosscheck data has required significant ELECT staff resources that are not accounted for when proponents claim the program is 'free'.\\" Prior to the legally mandated suspension of the program, 12 states (Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Washington) had withdrawn from the free program. Despite over seven million \\"potential double registrants\\" being \\"flagged\\" by the Crosscheck program in 2014, less than four people were charged with voting more than once, and not a single flagging led to a conviction, casting doubt on the system's usefulness.  Discrimination allegations  The loose matching standards used to identify \\"potential duplicate registrants\\" by the Kansas Secretary of State also raised significant concerns about the opportunity for racial bias in list maintenance. According to \\"Health of State Democracies\\", \\"50 percent of Communities of Color share a common surname, while only 30 percent of white people do,\\" so that in the program's flagged lists, \\"white voters are underrepresented by 8 percent, African Americans are overrepresented by 45 percent; Hispanic voters are overrepresented by 24 percent; and Asian voters are overrepresented by 31 percent\\". After examining \\"potential duplicate registrant\\" lists from some of the participating states, investigative reporter Greg Palast claimed the Crosscheck system \\"disproportionately threatens solid Democratic constituencies: young, black, Hispanic and Asian-American voters\\" with the intention of securing Republican victories. Palast concluded this was achieved by eliminating discrete individuals based on nothing more than similarity of name, a method with a \\"built-in racial bias\\" that especially eliminated voters from targeted minorities with a more limited pool of given names, for example, Hispanic voters named Jose Garcia.The GOP's Stealth War Against Voters, Rolling Stone, 24 August 2016 However, presence on the \\"potential duplicate registrant\\" list did not mean a voter was removed from the rolls. Independent investigators found that most states reported not using the Crosscheck \\"potential duplicate registrant\\" lists in any way.  Data security and data handling lapses  Articles in ProPublica and Gizmodo, relying on information provided by activists in Illinois and Kansas, revealed in fall 2017 that the Kansas- managed database holding nearly 100 million records of private voter data were protected by security protocols so flawed they could be \\"hacked by a novice\\". Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach demurred saying \\"I don't concede there is a problem\\" but also pledged to quickly fix the data security issues. After a subsequent consultation with the Division of Homeland Security, Kobach quietly halted Crosscheck for 2018 in advance of his gubernatorial race in Kansas. His successor as Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab subsequently settled a lawsuit filed by ACLU of Kansas alleging that the constitutional right of their plaintiffs to privacy was violated by his office's careless handling of a Crosscheck file. Schwab's settlement acknowledged errors in handling voters' private data and requires that Kansas suspend the program until stringent data security standards are in place.https://www.aclukansas.org/en/press-releases/aclu-kansas-settlement- puts-crosscheck-out-commission-foreseeable-future-program  Utility  Crosscheck was frequently cited, without supporting evidence, as a critical tool to prevent voter fraud. Critics said that Crosscheck's utility was limited to a very specific type of fraud (double voting), in a very specific situation (across state lines), at very specific times (general elections only). Double voting within a state cannot be detected. Double voting in a primary election cannot be detected. Voting on the records of a deceased person cannot be detected. In addition to problems with false positives and limited scope, Crosscheck has also had false negative results: the failure to recognize voters who are registered in two states if there is even a slight variation in their name. For example, Vic Miller registered in Kansas would not be recognized as the same as Victor Miller registered in Missouri despite the same full date of birth and last four digits of the social security number.  Voter registration maintenance programs  Debate about Crosscheck is part of a larger, ongoing controversy over whether or not such voter registration programs are a valid means of protecting against fraud. A 2018 study by researchers at Stanford University, University of Pennsylvania, Yale University, and Harvard University quantified the tradeoff between voter accessibility and electoral integrity when purging a likely duplicate registration from another state using Crosscheck. Their analysis of Crosscheck results in from Iowa in 2012 and 2014 suggests that for every double vote prevented, use of Crosscheck's proposed purge strategy impedes approximately 300 legitimate registrations. This finding is in a \\"best practices\\" scenario in which all false positives have been removed. The authors emphasize that election authorities should consider the tradeoff between election access for all eligible voters and fraud prevention.

Location Mothel Abbey is located in Mothel village, south of Carrick-on-Suir. History Graveslab of Richard Power, d. 1483. Mothel was an early monastic site, founded in the 6th century either by Brocc√°n Cl√≥en (Brogan, feast day 8 July) or, according to the Martyrology of Donegal, St. Brogan Scribe. C√∫an succeeded Brogan. It was refounded by the Augustinian Canons Regular after 1140, and they controlled a large region of central County Waterford. The remaining buildings date to the 13th century, and a tomb from c. 1500. The last abbot, Edmund Power, surrendered the abbey on 7 April 1540 as part of the Dissolution of the Monasteries. For a limited time period in the first half of the 17th century, the Cistercian abbot Thomas Madan occupied Mothel, wrongly assuming that Mothel is a Cistercian foundation. This led to a prolonged conflict with Patrick Comerford, bishop of Waterford and Lismore and Vicar General of the Order of Canons Regular of St. Augustine, who eventually convinced Madan before his death in 1645.

This Greek Revival church is a single-story, frame building which rests on granite piers and has been underpinned with masonry brick. In December 1993, the historic sanctuary was saved from a fire which destroyed a brick choir room addition attached to the wood frame sanctuary building. The fire, determined to have been set by an arsonist, heavily damaged both the sanctuary and the Sunday School building. In the year following the fire, the church, under the leadership of former pastor Rev. James S.

It is the oldest surviving home in Ottawa County. Historians believe it may have been the family home of the Wolcott family during the 1820s. It should not be confused with the wooden lighthouse keeper's house adjacent to the Marblehead Light, built in 1880.The Fire Lands Pioneer (series); Firelands Historical Society, 1858-1878 Origins Due to conflicting records, it's unclear whether the stone 'Keeper's House' was actually the home of Marblehead Light (Ohio) lighthouse keeper Benajah Wolcott during his 1822‚Äì32 tenure. Records indicate that +++ members of the Wolcott family purchased the land from Seth Steel in the early 1830s. However, Benajah Wolcott was never the landowner, according to official property records.Huron County (Ohio) property deed- records, 1809-1838, publ. by FamilySearch.org (online) The house stands 2 miles from the lighthouse, in approximately the center of original \\"Lot 15\\",Ottawa County (Ohio) Auditor, tax-maps whereas Wolcott's property in the area was within the original \\"Lot 17\\" beginning in the year 1808. Local custom states that Wolcott had the stone Keeper's House built as a wedding present for Rachel Miller on their 1822 marriage. He also owned property in Sandusky, Ohio.History of the Fire Lands (Ohio), by Williams 1879. p.432 After the marriage, Wolcott may have lived there between shipping seasons.Huron County (Ohio) Tax Records, 1824-1832, publ. by FamilySearch.org (online) After Wolcott‚Äôs death in 1832, Rachel and their son lived in the home until 1896, when it was sold to an owner outside the family. The Keeper‚Äôs House was occupied from 1822 until the last residential owners died in 1987. In 1989, the Ottawa County Historical Society purchased the home, restored it and maintains it as a historical museum with tours and special events. Disproved historical legends are associated with the land on which the Keeper's House stands. One relates to the War of 1812: some local historians previously (erroneously) suggested that it was the former site of Wolcott's first \\"log cabin\\" ‚Äî and therefore theorized that it was within \\"Wolcott's\\" log-cabin where several dozen Ohio soldiers and local citizens sought refuge during a \\"skirmish with Indians\\" in September 1812. Although the location was right, a man called Paterson owned the cabin. Ruggles-Doolittle map; original 1809 print-copy appended/annotated 1812; transcribed/redrawn by Jerry Deinzer, 1974 (copy, Firelands Historical Soc.) Wolcott said his first home was not a log- cabin, but a frame-structure house, which was burned to the ground by Native Americans or the British military, at the beginning of the War of 1812.)United States Congressional serial set. 178. (1828) Another local folk legend claiming the \\"Wolcott House\\" to be the \\"Keeper's House\\" is the story that Wolcott walked the 2 mile distance from this property to the Marblehead lighthouse every night to light the beacon. In fact, Wolcott may well have resided at a different stone house right beside the lighthouse. The wood-frame lighthouse keeper's house replaced the stone property in 1880.

Plot Albert Toddey (Jason), who daydreams of being a James Bond-type secret agent, recalls in flashback how he came to be a ‚Äúgovernment employee with a position of responsibility‚Äù: Having been sent a ticket for a supposed high-end gentlemen's club, Albert attends but finds it is a low-end strip club. The club is under surveillance by two bowler-hatted bumbling Home Office investigators Chumley (Lloyd) and Fosdyke (Barrett) who use a variety of transparent disguises throughout the film. While Desiree (Bond), a stripper, performs. Albert notices an off-stage argument between the attractive Stella (Hassall) and bouncer Harry (Prowse), and daydreams of overpowering Harry and rescuing her. Acting on this impulse, he is instead drenched in the water from a mop-bucket, and‚Äîalong with Stella, who was caught going through the boss's desk‚Äîis thrown out into the street. Stella takes pity on him and asks him back to her apartment to dry off; but, as he changes, Stella is kidnapped by Harry. She manages to indicate to Albert that he should find a book, handwritten in Arabic, that she stole from the desk. Chumley and Fosdyke enter the flat, posing as gas meter readers, and advise Albert to take the book to an Eastern trading company for translation, where they lie in wait for him. At the trading company, they translate an address of a house in the country before Albert takes back the book and escapes. At the country house, Albert finds the owner of the strip club, Fox (Cross), Harry and a number of hoods running a trade in white slavery. Harry offers up his girlfriend Desiree to complete an order, along with six women chained up in the cellar. Albert sneaks in through the open French windows, and finds one of the women in the cellar is Stella. He daydreams of taking a poker from the upstairs fireplace, freeing the women with it, tying up the hoods and knocking out Fox. Albert finds no poker, but finds a tyre iron in a van outside, and creates a diversion to re-enter the house by jamming on the van's horn. He fails either to free the women or tie up the hoods, and is chained up overnight with Stella. Meanwhile, Chumley and Fosdyke enter the house posing as census takers, but leave suspicious‚Äîfor all the names they are given for the residents are of famous film actors. In the morning, the captives, along with Desiree, are taken in the van to a dockyard warehouse. On the journey, Chumley and Fosdyke appear from hiding in the back of the van, and Stella reveals herself to be an undercover police officer investigating Fox. At the warehouse, while Stella is interrogated over the stolen book, Albert daydreams about overpowering their guard, knocking out the hoods with a hare-brained pulley system and locking Fox in a crate. His scheme fails; however, he manages to knock out the hoods one by one by dropping crates on their heads, while Desiree and the other women gleefully chain up their erstwhile captors. Albert knocks Fox into the dock while Stella phones the police. As a reward, Albert gets his ‚Äúposition of responsibility‚Äù‚Äîas the doorman at New Scotland Yard.

As editor, Publisher, and later, Chairman of the Board of Directors, of the Cincinnati Times-Star, Taft was an influential figure in local and national politics throughout the first half of the twentieth century. He was a grandson of Alphonso Taft, Secretary of War during the Grant administration; a nephew of President William Howard Taft; and cousin of Ohio Senator Robert A.Taft.  Biography  Hulbert Taft was born in Cincinnati, Ohio on September 19, 1877. He was the only son of Peter Rawson Taft II (half brother of William Howard Taft) and Annie Matilda Hulbert. Following his graduation from Yale University in 1900, Taft joined the staff of the Cincinnati Times-Star as a reporter, and became the Editor in 1908. His uncle, Charles Phelps Taft had been the paper's owner and Publisher since 1880. When Charles died in 1929, Hulbert Taft was named Publisher. Among his more noteworthy assignments, were interviews with Benito Mussolini, in 1929, and later, with Leon Trotsky. Taft was well known for his political conservatism. The journalist and author John Gunther, in his book Inside U.S.A. referred to Hulbert Taft as the \\"most conservative man I met in forty-eight states\\". Taft's editorials and political endorsements published in the Cincinnati Times-Star made him an influential figure in local and national politics for fifty years. Many considered him a \\"king maker\\". Political candidates viewed his endorsements as \\"tantamount to election\\". Taft retired as Publisher of the Cincinnati Times-Star in 1954, but remained as Chairman of the Board of Directors until 1958, when the newspaper was acquired by the E.W. Scripps Company.  Family  Hulbert Taft was married three times. His first marriage to Nellie Phillips Leaman on April 4, 1904 produced four children: Hulbert Taft, Jr.; Katherine Phillips Taft Benedict; Margot Leaman Taft Tytus; and David Gibson Taft. His second marriage was to Nellie's niece, Virginia Kittredge, on July 21, 1928. Eleanor Lawrence Gholson, Taft's third wife, was a distant relative of Virginia's.

It is close to The Cat Inn and St Margaret's Church. It is now a museum, open to the public six days a week from March to October. History The Priest House and Garden, West Hoathly. The Priest House was built for the Priory of St Pancras in Lewes as an estate office to manage the land they owned around West Hoathly but was seized by Henry VIII following the dissolution of the monasteries. Subsequently, it belonged to Anne of Cleves, Thomas Cromwell, Mary I and Elizabeth I although there is no evidence that any of them visited the property. It passed into private ownership in 1560 and was owned by the Browne family (who were yeoman farmers) until 1695. For the following two hundred years it was owned by absentee landlords who allowed it to fall into disrepair. It was bought by John Godwin King and restored for him by Maurice Pocock in 1908. John Godwin King presented it to the Sussex Archaeological Society in 1935. The house and garden have been open to the public since 1908. It is now a museum of local life with country furniture, ironwork and local history with temporary exhibitions. The cottage garden features large herbaceous borders containing over 170 herbs and perennials and is open to the public from March to October. The garden has been opened twice per annum for the National Gardens Scheme for the past twenty-two years. Architecture The Priest House was originally built as a hall house with a central hearth and was probably thatched. The frame is made of oak, held together with oak pegs, then filled with panels of wattle and daub (there are exposed panels visible in the south bedroom). It had five bays, the solar wing being in the northern two bays, the middle two bays were the hall and the southernmost the service end with buttery and pantry. At this time the house was lit by a large unglazed window. The floor was earthen, covered with rushes and sweet smelling herbs. About 1580 a central chimney was inserted, an upper floor put in the central two bays where the hall was and the house was reroofed with a Horsham Slab stone roof. The roof weighs approximately 16 tons The inglenook fireplaces are made of local stone and have curves on the side where knives have been sharpened. The original pointed doorway was blocked and a new doorway inserted in the wall beside it. The roof is an unbroken ridge line with three of the original trusses remaining: The middle truss of the hall had arched braces below the tie beam of which one brace still remains. The roof construction is a crown post and collar purlin. The rafters are in pairs, halved at the top & held together by a horizontal collar. Supporting the collars is the ‚Äúcollar purlin‚Äù; supported by the crown posts, which take the weight of the roof down to the tie beams. This is all held in place by curved braces next truss to the north was the closed frame of the end of the hall bays and it has a visible king post strutted from the tie beam. The south end of the house has a sloping catslide roof, also of Horsham slab. Suffragette Handkerchief On the first floor The Suffragette Handkerchief is on display. There are sixty-six embroidered signatures and two sets of initials, mostly of women imprisoned in HMP Holloway for their part in the Women's Social and Political Union Suffragette window smashing demonstrations of March 1912. The handkerchief was found at a local jumble sale by Dora Arnold, custodian in the 1960s. Its link to the village of West Hoathly is not clear (although John Godwin King's daughter Ursula was a member of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies ) and research is ongoing. The list of the signatories and some notes on their activism is available. Witch marks Apotropaic carving on a door at the Priest House West Hoathly There are witch marks scratched into wood in several places in the house including the front door and on the beam above the main fireplace. These are more properly known as apotropaic marks and were believed to prevent witches from entering the house. They are believed to date from the seventeenth century. Set into the ground outside the front door is a rough slab of iron which is waste from a local furnace. This was believed to prevent witches entering the house (witches were commonly believed to be scared of iron).

Childhood education By age ten she had decided to become an artist. Her grandmothers, Isabella Totto and Catherine O'Keeffe, painted still lifes and flowers. Her sisters, Catherine and Ida, made and sold their paintings and Anita, another sister, also painted. When she was eleven, art lessons were arranged for her and her younger sisters, Ida and Anita, at their home. She and her sister received art instruction from local watercolorist Sara Mann, who taught her to copy images from Text Books for Art Education by Louis Prang. The books showed how to create simple shapes and up to complex compositions. Although she appreciated learning how to create two-dimensional images of nature, she knew at that time that she did not want to be an artist that created traditional works of art or and had little interest in painting portraits. Georgia O'Keefe, Untitled (Seated Figure), 1901-1902, graphite on paper O'Keeffe attended high school at Sacred Heart Academy in Madison, Wisconsin as a boarder between 1901 and 1902, and her parents provided extra tuition for art classes‚Äîusing crayon, charcoal or oil paints‚Äîthat were taught by a nun with high expectations, Sister Angelique. When her family moved to Williamsburg, Virginia in late 1902, O'Keeffe and her brother, Francis, stayed in Wisconsin with her aunt, Lenore Totto, who was a school teacher. Her art studies at the high school allowed her to further develop her skills in making images of flowers, like a surviving watercolor of tiny cherry blossoms. She was proud of a watercolor that she created of a lighthouse on moonlit night. The foreground depicts a green grass, trees, and a path leading to the lighthouse. A sailboat is at sea under a moon and a cloudy sky. Although it was an early work, it conveyed a romantic mood and was a complex composition. Georgia O'Keeffe, Untitled, vase of flowers, watercolor on paper, 17 3/4 x 11 1/2 in. (45.1 x 29.2 cm), between 1903 and 1905 She joined her family in Virginia in 1903 and completed high school as a boarder at Chatham Episcopal Institute in Virginia (now Chatham Hall) and graduated in 1905. Elizabeth May Willis, who studied at Art Students League of New York, was her art teacher and the principle of the school. Willis gave O'Keeffe special privileges, including being able to use the art school room after school hours. While at Chatham, sometime between 1903 and 1905, she made a watercolor painting of a vase of red flowers with green leaves as a study. The watercolor paintings that she was liked the most from that period include one of ears of yellow and red corn, with the school kept as an example of a student's best work, and another of a bunch of lilacs. O'Keeffe, the art director of the school's 1905 yearbook, illustrated the book with her cartoons, drawings, and illustrations. They reflect an interest in Art Nouveau, pointillism, symbolism, and the works of Charles Dana Gibson. Willis urged the O'Keeffes to send their daughter to the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Advanced training O'Keeffe studied and ranked at the top of her class at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago from 1905 to 1906, studying with John Vanderpoel. She began her studies with the intention of becoming a teacher, which was considered a practical occupation for a woman. For financial reasons, O'Keeffe lived on Indiana Avenue with Ollie and Charles Totto, siblings of her mother. Chicago was the center of the Arts and Crafts movement and many of the buildings were Art Nouveau style architecture. Her education, though, began by creating drawings of plaster casts. The school focused on traditional forms of art over modern forms of art, like Impressionism. Georgia O'Keeffe, Untitled, Dead Rabbit with Copper Pot, 1908, Art Students League of New York In 1907, she attended the Art Students League in New York City, where she studied under William Merritt Chase, Kenyon Cox and F. Luis Mora. She won the League's William Merritt Chase still-life prize for her oil painting Dead Rabbit with Copper Pot in 1908. Her prize was a scholarship to attend the League's outdoor summer school in Lake George, New York. In 1908, O'Keeffe found out that she would not be able to finance her studies. Her father had gone bankrupt and her mother was seriously ill with tuberculosis. She also was not interested in creating a career as a painter based upon the mimetic tradition which had formed the basis of her art training. She took a job in Chicago as a commercial artist and worked there until 1910, when she returned to Virginia to recuperate from a case of the measles and later moved with her family to Charlottesville. She did not paint for four years, and said that the smell of turpentine made her sick. She began teaching art in 1911. One of her positions was her former school, Chatham Episcopal Institute in Virginia. University of Virginia She took a summer art class in 1912 at the University of Virginia from Alon Bemet, who was a Columbia University Teachers College faculty member. Under Bemet, she learned of innovative ideas of Arthur Wesley Dow, a colleague of her instructor. Dow's approach was influenced by principles of Japanese art regarding design and composition. She began to experiment with abstract compositions and develop a personal style that veered away from realism and towards abstract art. O'Keefe's paintings from this period were shown at the 2016-17 exhibition O'Keeffe at the University of Virginia, 1912‚Äì1914.

Fort Astoria In the official Fort Astoria logbook maintained by station manager Duncan McDougall, Stuart was recorded in May 1811 as suffering overexertion and potentially a hernia from clearing timber. In the same month, the Chinookans reported sighting a merchant vessel near their settlements on the coast. Rather than lose the beaver skins to rival Maritime fur traders, McDougall sent Stuart on the 22nd of May to Comcomly's village across the Columbia River. The reported vessel never actually appeared after its existence was announced by Chinookan traders. This episode has been suggested by historian Robert F. Jones to have been a Chinookan \\"stratagem\\" to \\"secure better prices, perhaps for inferior skins.\\" Stuart returned the following day with only 20 beaver pelts. Throughout June, Stuart and Gabriel Franch√®re cleared, planted and maintained a garden to grow an amount of fresh produce. In the same month, David was also appointed to oversee two canoes of men to go gather large stockpiles of tree bark. This material was utilised by the fur traders to create roofing and siding for their dwellings and related buildings. He departed with four French-Canadians and four Hawaiian Kanakas near the end of June from Astoria to Cape Disappointment. The party was taken there by Coalpo on a canoe the Clatsop noble owned. While there he reviewed the general terrain and fur bearing animal populations. Fort Okanogan In July 1811, Stuart was given orders to open a second trade post for the PFC. The intelligence for a suitable location came from Ka√∫xuma N√∫pika, a Two-Spirit from the Ktunaxa people. Ka√∫xuma recommended that the station be opened near the confluence of the Columbia and \\"the Okannaakken River.\\" The personnel assigned to join Stuart were eight men, including Alexander Ross, Fran√ßois Benjamin Pillet, Ovide de Montigny, and Naukane. The party left on the 21st, following the course of the Columbia River in the company of David Thompson and his party of NWC men. Thompson had previously came down the Columbia to Fort Astoria on the 15th of July from New Caledonia. A French-Canadian assigned to the interior journey under Stuart back arrived at Fort Astoria in early October. He brought back news of the successful opening of Fort Okanogan and that the Syilx peoples were reportedly favorable to developing commercial ties with the PFC. However, in tours of the hinterlands trade goods of the NWC were found among the local inhabitants near Fort Okanogan's eventual location. On 18 January 1812, Stuart arrived at Fort Astoria with √âtienne Lucier, Robert McClellan, John Reed and seven other men. McClellan, Reed and Lucier were members of the overland expedition that had traveled overland from Fort Mackinac (in the modern state of Michigan) under W. Price Hunt's authority. The assembled men told McDougall of the remaining members of the expedition and their privations crossing the continent. Stuart's party had to leave Hunt and the majority of the PFC laborers in the Snake River basin to procure supplies and aid at Astoria. In the meantime Alexander Ross was left alone at Fort Okanogan, wintering among the Syilx. The addition of fifty or more men was feared by McDougall to potentially wreck the already uncertain Astorian food stockpiles. Hunt, about thirty men, Marie Aioe Dorio and her two children reached Fort Astoria on 15 February 1812.

Etymology  The name of the castle and its owners has changed throughout history. The name \\"Steinbach\\" has been spelled differently throughout history, e.g. Steinbac (1276), Stambaz (1363), Stembasche (1372), Stembaix (1372), Stembay (1395-1580), and Stembaye (1611-1716).  History  The foundations and the basement of the castle date back to the 11th century and are built with schist stone. The stone-carved escutcheon built into the fa√ßade of the castle contains three scallops referring to Steinbach and Limerl√©, and three sickles referring to Grumelscheid. The Steinbach family and dynasty became lords of Rouvroy and Limerl√© in 1451 and will keep this title and rule the region until the late 18th century. Alliances were built through marriage and over the years the titles of the lord of Steinbach, Limerl√©, Grumelscheid, Aspelt, Bourcy and Longvilly were added to this noble house. As an example a document dated 1578 refers to the marriage of Georges Ramel de Steinbach and Margueritte de Grumelscheid. During the Spanish reign over what is now known as Belgium and Holland Martin I de Steinbach bought back his castle and his right to rule the region from King Philip IV of Spain. He equally acquired the right to speak justice and the death penalty. On the 1777 Ferraris maps, a gallows can be found close to the castle. The links with the Spanish rulers, however, was still very strong and as such, some revenues of the land would be to the benefit of Isabella of Spain in infinity. The three lions can be found back on the escutcheons of Catherine van der Heyden wife of Martin de Steinbach. The escutcheon of Martin de Steinbach are as mention the three saint James scallops referring to Santiago de Compostela. In 1802 shortly after the French revolution, Henri de Steinbach buys a Malmedy-based paper mill which the monks of Malmedy had started in 1750. This mill was the base for what was soon to be known as a brand of famous photographic film. The wealth coming from this paper mill allowed the family to maintain their castle. In Malmedy the Villa Lang and Villa Steissel, both national monuments were built by the Steinbach family. The family owned the Castle of Liherin and the castle du Mesnil both located in Steinbach as well as 4.000 hectares of farmland and woods. During the Second World War the castle played a significant role in the Battle of the Bulge. It was beside a temporary headquarter for Leon Degrelle and his government a field hospital for both the German and US army. The castle stayed in the hands of descendants of the Steinbach family until 2014 when it was sold to its current owners who used it as a second residence.  Architecture  The castle has a very Austrian style architecture which can be explained by the fact that the castle was erected after a devastating fire in 1750 which burnt most of the existing castle to ruins. The architect was Albert Starck from Austria who during the Austrian reign of this part of Europe built several important buildings (today national monuments) in this area such as the rectory of Bovingy. The castle itself is built in 1.5-meter thick schist stone walls. The wings were added in the early 19th century and served as farmhouses. The farm was reachable from the outside leaving all privacy to the castle. The interior floors are built in schist stone and the style is Louis XV. The main entrance to the castle is carved out of Recht stone and contains the escutcheon of the Beurth√©. The farms also contain a wood oven dating back to the 16th century. The oven is still in regular use today. On the top of the tower, one can see elephant shaped flags bearing the family escutcheons and building date. All buildings on this site are protected as national monuments.

Also known as Burger King Drive-Inn, it was founded by former Imperial Oil executives William R. Jarvis (1926-21 July 2014) and James Duncan Rae (3 September 1923 - 17 December 2014) in 1956. Among the first American-style fast food restaurants in Edmonton, it was not related to the worldwide Burger King chain. Company headquarters were in offices above one of the restaurants, at 9501 111 Avenue. Its signature items included a mushroom burger and a \\"Canadian Burger\\". The restaurant was inspired by a visit Jarvis paid to Great Falls, Montana in 1953, when he stayed next to a Dairy Queen drive-in. After the chain turned down his request for a franchise, he and Rae formed their own Dairy Drive-In at 8705 118 Avenue. Two years later, when their lease expired, they hauled the building to a site at 112 Avenue, where it would become the first Burger King. It opened one year before the first outlet of what would become its main rival, A&W.; The US chain entered the Canadian market in 1969 with a store in Windsor, Ontario. In 1973, Jarvis and Rae reached an agreement that granted their rival the rights to the \\"Burger King\\" name for all of Canada except Alberta north of the 52nd parallel, passing through Innisfail, which was reserved in perpetuity for the local chain. By 1975, when McDonald's opened its first Edmonton restaurant near Capilano Mall, Burger King had 12 outlets. At the time, the company held a franchise for Kentucky Fried Chicken in Edmonton, with its outlets using dual branding. However, as the market became more competitive, the relationship between the two companies deteriorated, with KFC attempting legal action to end the partnership. The matter was ultimately resolved in 1990, when KFC, then under the ownership of PepsiCo, refused to extend the franchise, and Jarvis and Rae instead sold their remaining dual-branded restaurants to them. In August 1995, when two non-KFC Burger King restaurants were still in operation, they sold the naming rights for northern Alberta for $1 million to the US company. It immediately announced its intention to enter the market, the last region of North America where it had been unable to operate, other than Mattoon, Illinois, where another restaurant uses the name. Several Burger King restaurants became Burger Barons.

There are multiple ways to manipulate a microorganism in order to increase maximum product yields. Introduction of mutations into an organism may be accomplished by introducing them to mutagens. Another way to increase production is by gene amplification, this is done by the use of plasmids, and vectors. The plasmids and/ or vectors are used to incorporate multiple copies of a specific gene that would allow more enzymes to be produced that eventually cause more product yield. The manipulation of organisms in order to yield a specific product has many applications to the real world like the production of some antibiotics, vitamins, enzymes, amino acids, solvents, alcohol and daily products. Microorganisms play a big role in the industry, with multiple ways to be used. Medicinally, microbes can be used for creating antibiotics in order to treat antibiotics. Microbes can also be used for the food industry as well. Microbes are very useful in creating some of the mass produced products that are consumed by people. The chemical industry also uses microorganisms in order to synthesize amino acids and organic solvents. Microbes can also be used in an agricultural application for use as a biopesticide instead of using dangerous chemicals and or inoculants to help plant proliferation.  Medical application  Representation of bioreactors. They are used to store the microbes while they are producing desired product of interest. The medical application to industrial microbiology is the production of new drugs synthesized in a specific organism for medical purposes. Production of antibiotics is necessary for the treatment of many bacterial infections. Some natural occurring antibiotics and precursors, are produced through a process called fermentation. The microorganisms grow in a liquid media where the population size is controlled in order to yield the greatest amount of product. In this environment nutrient, pH, temperature, and oxygen are controlled also in order to maximize the amount of cells and cause them not to die before the production of the antibiotic of interest. Once the antibiotic is produced it must be extracted in order to yield an income. Vitamins also get produced in massive quantities either by fermentation or biotransformation. Vitamin B 2 (riboflavin) for example is produced both ways. Biotransformation is mostly used for the production of riboflavin, and the carbon source starting material for this reaction is glucose. There are a few strains of microorganisms that were engineered to increase the yield of riboflavin produced. The most common organism used for this reaction is Ashbya gossypii. The fermentation process is another common way to produce riboflavin. The most common organism used for production of riboflavin through fermentation is Eremothecium ashbyii. Once riboflavin is produced it must be extracted from the broth, this is done by heating the cells for a certain amount of time, and then the cells can be filtered out of solution. Riboflavin is later purified and released as final product. Microbial biotransformation can be used to produce steroid medicaments. Steroids can be consumed either orally or by injection. Steroids play a big role in the control of arthritis. Cortisone is an anti-inflammatory drug that fights against arthritis, as well as several skin diseases. Another steroid used is testosterone, which was produced from dehydroepiandrosterone by using the Corynebacterium species.  Food industry application   Fermentation  Fermentation is a reaction where sugar can be converted into a gas, alcohols or acids. Fermentation happens anaerobically, which means microorganisms that go through fermentation can function without the presence of oxygen. Yeasts and bacteria are commonly used to mass produce multiple products. Drinking alcohol is a product that is produced by yeasts and bacteria. Alcohol that can be consumed is also known as ethanol, and ethanol is used to power automobiles as a fuel source. Drinking alcohol is produced from natural sugars like glucose. Carbon dioxide is produced as a side product in this reaction and can be used to make bread, and can also be used to carbonate beverages. Fermentation Wine: Alcoholic beverages like beer and wine are fermented by microorganisms when there is no oxygen present. In this process, once there is enough alcohol and carbon dioxide around in the media the yeast start to die due to the environment becoming toxic to them. There are many strains of yeast and bacteria that can tolerate different amounts of alcohol around in their environment before it becoming toxic, thus one can obtain different alcohol levels in beer and wine, just by selecting a different microbial strain. Most yeast can tolerate between 10 and 15 percent alcohol, but there are some strains that can tolerate up to 21 percent alcohol. Dairy products like cheese and yogurt can also be made through fermentation using microbes. Cheese was produced as a way to preserve the nutrients obtained from milk, through fermentation thus elongating the shelf-life of the product. Microbes are used to convert the lactose sugars into lactic acid through fermentation. The bacteria used for such fermentation are usually from Lactococci, Lactobacilli, or Streptococci families. Sometimes these microbes are added before or after the acidification step needed for cheese production. Also these microbes are responsible for the different flavors of cheese, since they have enzymes that breakdown milk sugars and fats into multiple building blocks. Some other microbes like mold may be purposely introduced during or before the aging of the cheese, in order to give it a different flavor. The production of yogurt starts from the pasteurization of milk, where undesired microbes are reduced or eliminated. Once the milk is pasteurized the milk is ready to be processed to reduce fat and liquid content, so what remains is mostly solid content. This can be done by drying the milk so that the liquid evaporates or by adding concentrated milk. Increasing the solid content of the milk also increases the nutritional value since the nutrients are more concentrated. After this step is accomplished, the milk is ready for fermentation where the milk gets inoculated with bacteria in hygienic stainless steel containers and then gets carefully monitored for lactic acid production, temperature and pH. Enzymes can be produced through fermentation either by submerged fermentation and/ or by solid state fermentation. Submerged fermentation is referred to when the microorganisms are in contact with media. In this process the contact with oxygen is essential. The bioreactors/fermentors that are used to do these mass production of product can store up to 500 cubic meters in volume. Solid state fermentation is less common than submerged fermentation, but has many benefits. There is less need for the environment to be sterile since there is less water, there is a higher stability and concentration for the end product. Insulin synthesis is done through the fermentation process and the use of recombinant E.coli or yeast in order to make human insulin also called Humulin.  Agriculture application  The demand for agricultural products is constantly increasing due to the need of various fertilizers and pesticides. There are long term effects of the overuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Due to the excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, the soil becomes infertile and a non-sufficient use for growing crops. For that matter, biofertelizers, biopesticides and organic farming come to the rescue. Biopesticide is a pesticide derived from a living organism or natural occurring substances. Biochemical pesticides can also be produced from naturally occurring substances that can control pest populations in a non- toxic matter. An example of a biochemical pesticide is garlic and pepper based insecticides, these work by repelling insects from the desired location. Microbial pesticides, usually a virus, bacterium, or fungus are used to control pest populations in a more specific manner. The most commonly used microbe for the production of microbial bio-pesticides is Bacillus thuringiensis, also known as Bt. This spore forming bacterium produces a delta-endotoxins in which it causes the insect or pest to stop feeding on the crop or plant because the endotoxin destroys the lining of the digestive system.  Chemical application  Schematic workÔ¨Çow for microbial factory optimization Synthesis of amino acids and organic solvents can also be made using microbes. The synthesis of essential amino acids such as are L-Methionine, L-Lysine, L-Tryptophan and the non-essential amino acid L-Glutamic acid are used today mainly for feed, food, and pharmaceutical industries. The production of these amino acids is due to Corynebacterium glutamicum and fermentation. C.glutamicum was engineered to be able to produce L-lysine and L-Glutamic acid in large quantities. L-Glutamic acid had a high demand for production because this amino acid is used to produce Monosodium glutamate (MSG) a food flavoring agent. In 2012 the total production of L-Glutamic acid was 2.2 million tons and is produced using a submerged fermentation technique inoculated with C.glutamicum. L-Lysine was originally produced from diaminopimelic acid (DAP) by E.coli, but once the C.glutamicum was discovered for the production of L-Glutamic acid. This organism and other autotrophs were later modified to yield other amino acids such as lysine, aspartate, methionine, isoleucine and threonine. L-Lysine is used for the feeding of pigs and chicken, as well as to treat nutrient deficiency, increase energy in a patient, and sometimes used to treat viral infections. L-Tryptophan is also produced through fermentation and by Corynebacterium and E.coli, though the production is not as large as the rest of the amino acids it is still produced for pharmaceutical purposes since it can be converted and used to produce neurotransmitters. The production of organic solvents like acetone, butanol, and isopropanol through fermentation was one of the first things to be produced by using bacteria, since achieving the necessary chirality of the products is easily achieved by using living systems. Solvent fermentation uses a series of Clostridia bacterial species. Solvent fermentation at first was not as productive as it is used today. The amount of bacteria required to yield a product was high, and the actual yield of product was low. Later technological advances were discovered that allowed scientist to genetically alter these strains to achieve a higher yield for these solvents. These Clostridial strains were transformed to have extra gene copies of enzymes necessary for solvent production, as well as being more tolerant to higher concentrations of the solvent being produced, since these bacteria have a range of product in which they can survive in before the environment becomes toxic. Yielding more strains that can use other subtrates was also another way to increase the productivity of these bacteria.

Alkenyl succinic anhydrides (ASA) are modified five-membered succinic anhydrides bearing a branched iso-alkenyl chain (C14 to C22). They are colorless, and usually viscous liquids. They are widely used, especially in surface sizing of paper, paperboard, and cardboard, as well as in the hydrophobicization of cellulose fibers. Products treated with it show reduced penetration of aqueous media, such as inks or drinks (like milk or fruit juices). In terms of their mode of action, the anhydride is proposed to react with the hydroxyl groups on the cellulose, forming an ester. The alkenyl side-chain modifies the surface properties of the paper product. The application is similar to that for alkyl ketene dimers. In the United States alkenylsuccinic anhydrides are the preferred paper sizing agents, whereas in Europe, alkyl ketene dimers (AKDs) predominate.  History  The reaction of maleic anhydride (MAN) with aliphatic monounsaturated n- and iso-alkenes was described as early as 1936 in a patent. The alkenes are obtained from the \\"cracked distillate\\", a distillate fraction with a high content of unsaturation formed by cracking of petroleum. En-Reaktion zu ASA The patent describes the reaction of the alkenes with excess maleic anhydride at 200 ¬∞C in an autoclave. The excess alkene is removed by distillation in vacuo, the resulting alkenyl succinic anhydride hydrolyzed with dilute sodium hydroxide solution and the disodium salt reacted with an acid to achieve an alkenebutanedioic acid. However, under the \\"many useful applications\\" described for the products obtained, the use as a size has not yet been mentioned. 30% higher reaction yields were achieved with a pre-cleaned cracked petroleum distillate in an autoclave at 210 ¬∞C and it was found that the hydrolysis of the succinic anhydride can already be carried out with steam. In the early technical applications as lubricants and rust inhibitors, the products dark brown color and black, tar-like polymer residues was unproblematic. However, for later use in cleaners and detergents, clear (meaning polymer-free) and less dark colored alkenyl succinic anhydride (ASA) were needed. The use of alkenylsuccinic anhydrides to hydrophobize cellulose- based (cotton) textiles (first patented in 1959) and the transfer of this concept to the hydrophobization of paper using iso-octadecenyl succinic anhydrides (C18-ASA) in 1963 required liquid, particle-free colours with a colour as light as possible. After initial difficulties in using ASA for paper sizing (particularly the rapid hydrolysis to alkenyl succinic acids and the formation of poorly soluble calcium salts in hard water and deposits in the paper machine), process parameters could be adjusted to make alkenyl succinic anhydrides the most important sizing agents in the US. Reaktion von ASA mit Wasser und Calciumionen  Preparation  ASAs are prepared in the Alder-ene reaction of alkenes with maleic anhydride at high temperatures (> 200 ¬∞C). Thereby, competing reactions occur, such as oxidation, condensation and (alternating co-) polymerization. The undesirable secondary products are formed reduce the yield of ASA and adversely affect color, texture and processability of the final products. Unbranched 1-alkenylsuccinic anhydrides, which can be obtained from 1-alkenes, are solid at room temperature and not suited for engine sizing from aqueous emulsion. In the SHOP process, even- numbered 1-alkenes (CH2=CH-(CH2)n-CH3, produced by oligomerization of ethylene) are isomerized on magnesium oxide catalysts with displacement of the double bond to a position along the carbon chain. Subsequently, the crude product is separated by distillation into the desired fractions, the fraction preferred for ASA production is the C14 ‚Äì C22. Isomerisierung von terminalen Alkenen zu iso-Alkenen The alkenyl succinic anhydrides are prepared with an excess of isoalkene at temperatures >200 ¬∞C under nitrogen atmosphere for more than 3 hours; the excess iso-alkene is distilled off at reduced pressure. Synthese von ASA mit Maleins√§ureanhydrid und iso-Alken Extensive patent literature exists with regard to the suppression of side reactions in the production of ASA. The formation of polymer can be reduced by the addition of antioxidants or polymerization inhibitors (for example hydroquinone or phenothiazine). Thereby, a quantitative reaction of the maleic anhydride can be achieved. Later, it was also achieved to improve the color of the obtained solid ASA from dark brown to amber by washing with water. By combining a reducing agent (such as a trialkyl phosphite) with a phenolic antioxidant, a significant lightening and reduction of tar formation is achieved. However, recent patents show that the problem of discoloration and tar formation in ASA synthesis is still insufficiently resolved. Recent patents include a sterically hindered phenol (BHT as a primary antioxidant), a thioether (as a secondary antioxidant) and N,N'-disalicylidene-1,2-diaminopropane as a metal ion deactivator in a \\"synergistic blend\\". The C12-ASA formed from dodecene and MAN after six hours at 220 ¬∞C is light yellow in color but still contains significant amounts of black, tarry decomposition products. A dramatic improvement (by 600%) in sizing efficiency is found with alkenyl succinic anhydrides based on symmetrical alkenes, such as the C22 alkene docos-11-en (by alkene metathesis from dodec-1-ene).  Use  Alkenylsuccinic anhydrides - and the alkenylsuccinic acids obtainable therefrom by hydrolysis - possess reactive and surface-active properties. They find use as hardeners for epoxy resins, as corrosion inhibitors in lubricating oils, as reactants in alkyd resins and unsaturated polyester resins, as an additive in motor oil and fuels, as components in plasticizers, as additives in toner resins, as surfactants, as water-binding and moisture-controlling additives, as metal cleaners and as chemical intermediates. By far the most important use of alkenylsuccinic anhydrides by volume is the surface and bulk sizing of paper and cardboard with a global consumption of approximately 47,000 tonnes (in 2005).S. Porkert, Physico-chemical processes during reactive paper sizing with alkenyl succinic anhydride (ASA), Dissertation, Technische Universit√§t Dresden, 2016, http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:14-qucosa-219620  Alkenylsuccinic anhydrides as paper sizing agents  Solid alkylketene dimers (AKD) were introduced in the 1950s as hydrophobizing agents for cellulose- based products. They were followed in the 1960s by liquid alkenyl succinic anhydrides. Both compound classes are hydrophobic and therefore virtually insoluble in water - the solubility of the commonly used iso- octadecenylsuccinic anhydride (C18-ASA) is only 5.33x10‚àí5 mgl‚àí1. ASA are less hydrophobic and thus less water repellent than AKD because of their shorter chain length. Their vapor pressure is higher than that of AKD, allowing them to diffuse faster into and through the paper layer. However, they also tend to form deposits on machine covers. AKD are at room temperature aqueous dispersions, while ASA are oil-in-water emulsions. The main difference, however, is the much higher reactivity of the cyclic carboxylic anhydride structure in the ASA compared to the diketene structure in AKD. This is accompanied by the much faster hydrolysis in aqueous, especially alkaline media. Therefore, alkenyl succinic anhydrides can be converted into an emulsion only before the use in the paper machine, while AKD can be delivered and stored as stable emulsions. ASA emulsions are prepared like AKD dispersions with polycations as protective colloids and retention aids (especially with cationic starch or cationic polyacrylamides (C-PAM) in the ratio ASA to cation of about 2: 1) and with about 1% anionic or nonionic surfactants. An optimal particle size of about 1 Œºm is obtained with high shear. The benefits of ASA when used in paper sizing include: * Applicability in neutral to slightly alkaline pH range (optimal pH 6-8) - AKD even pH 5-9) * High reactivity leads to hydrophobing already in the wet end of the paper process * Hydrophobization degree easily adjustable (unlike with AKD) * Lower dosage at ASA (0.1% based on pulp) than at AKD (0.2%) * Little influence on paper properties - AKD can lead to sticky paper surfaces at high dosage * Good surface sizing * High aging resistance of the treated paper The disadvantages of ASA are in particular: * High hydrolysis tendency * Very low storage stability * Emulsion production only at the paper machine with high investment and operating costs * Risk of formation of sticky deposits in the machine * Oily deposits in the dryer area Faster reaction and lower input quantities (and thus material costs in one of the most costly steps in papermaking) speak for the use of ASA, while AKD more sustainable water repellency and better adhesion in material composites with e.g. polyethylene films for water and acid-resistant beverage packaging effect. ASA are desirable, when faster reactions are needed and lower input quantities are used (leading to lower material costs in one of the most costly steps in papermaking). In contrast, AKDs result in more sustainable water repellency and better adhesion in material composites with, for example, polyethylene films for water and acid- resistant beverage packaging.  Paper sizing with alkenyl succinic anhydrides  As with AKD, paper sizing with ASA proceeds in theory in three steps: # the retention or fixation of the ASA emulsion droplets on the wet paper pulp # bursting the emulsion droplets via spreading on the surface and penetration into the pulp # the formation of a hydrophobic paper surface with contact angles >100¬∞ by covalent linkage of the ASA molecules with the hydroxyl groups of the cellulose postulierte ASA-Reaktion mit Cellulose Already in the 1990s, Japanese authors published studies that raised considerable doubts about this idealized representation of the hydrophobization of cellulose fiber surfaces. For example, it could be demonstrated that no or only very little ASA is bound to cellulose via covalent ester bonds. This suggests that the ASA-induced hydrophobing is rather based on an adsorptive and associative interaction of the alkenylsuccinic acids (formed by rapid hydrolysis in the aqueous medium) with the constituents of the paper pulp (cellulosic fibers and fillers, such as precipitated calcium carbonate or cationic polymers). Even small amounts and also inhomogeneous distribution are suffice for a high degree of hydrophobicity. Enormous challenges are posed by the trend towards recycled materials paper as raw material (the so-called secondary fibers), the rapid increase in the volume of cardboard at the expense of printing paper, the growing speeds (> 120 km/h) and production quantities (maximum daily capacity of a single machine >4,500 tons or >1.5 million tons per year), the further development of ASA-based sizing agents for cellulose and its formulations. This is especially true given the still very empirical understanding of the basic processes of hydrophobing cellulose fibers. Polyisobutenylsuccinic anhydride ASAs are related to the class of polyisobutylenylsuccinic anhydrides, known as PIBSAs. In these compounds, the alkene used is polyisobutylene. Such compounds are commonly used as reactive intermediates in the petroleum additive industry. They are reacted with ethyleneamines to give the corresponding succinimides useful as dispersants in lubricants and fuels. and deposit-control agents There are two types of polyisobutene used for this purpose, and they are commonly known as conventional and HR (highly reactive) PIB. Conventional PIB is made by polymerizing Raffinate 1 that contains a mixture of C4 butenes with aluminum trichloride as catalyst. In comparison, HR PIB is made by polymerizing isobutene using boron trifluoride as catalyst. The methyl vinylidene content of PIB controls its reactivity toward maleic anhydride. HR PIB has 85% methyl vinylidene, making it more reactive than conventional PIB that only has 10%. Being more reactive, HR PIB requires less forcing conditions for its reaction with maleic anhydride. The PIBSA produced contains less tars and side products as a result.

Godfrey summarily fired The Mariners in 1955 (a fairly common modus for Godfrey during these years).

First aired in November 2016, it is the first Argentine series made for Netflix. Plot The series take place in two time periods, one set three years after the events of the other, and each episode advances the plots set in each period. In the first time period, Rosario Santa Cruz (Juana Viale) is a famous television reporter, covering stories about victims of forced prostitution. Franco Vernal (Luciano C√°ceres) is a prosecutor, working on those cases and trying to take down the human trafficking networks. His half-brother, known as \\"agent H\\" (Esteban Lamothe), works as a mole, infiltrating those networks. After members of the human trafficking network kidnap Rosario, agent H rescues her and kills all the members of the network during the escape. He turns into a vigilante, killing the staffs of entire cabarets to liberate the prostitutes held captive there. Franco is ordered to find and stop agent H, but refuses to kill him, and allows him to escape as long as he stays undercover while Franco reports him dead. In the second time period, Franco and Rosario are about to get married, and Franco runs for vice president for the conservative party, but their plans are complicated by the return of the agent H. Production The series was created by Nacho Viale (brother of lead actress Juana Viale) and Diego Palacio, and it was shot in 2015 in the Buenos Aires Province and Villa La Angostura. The scenes in Villa La Angostura were filmed first. Juana Viale was still working at Bailando por un Sue√±o at the time, so her dancing partner and coach were taken to the production site as well, so that she could practice dancing at night. The series was filmed aiming for the international market, but not specifically for Netflix. Netflix contacted the production during the post-production stage. Nacho Viale said that it was an honor to produce the first Argentine TV series to premier on Netflix, but that he is also aware that it will have to compete with very important series. Nacho Viale revealed that the scripts for a second season are already written, but it would only be produced if the series has a positive reception. Reception The first season received mixed reviews from viewers. On Imdb an average rating of 6.1/10 while in filmaffinity has a user score of 4,8. In general, the series has interesting ideas but they are poorly executed and the acting is mediocre.

Cast * Fran√ßois Cluzet as Duval * Denis Podalyd√®s as Cl√©ment * Sami Bouajila as Labarthe * Simon Abkarian as Gerfaut * Alba Rohrwacher as Sara * as De Grugy * as Albert * Nader Farman as Al-Shamikh * Angelo Dello Spedale as Pernot * Jean-Marie Winling as Philippe Chalamont Plot Duval, a lonely, middle-aged accountant, has lost his job due to his alcoholism. He joins Alcoholics Anonymous, where he meets Sara, another recovering alcoholic, and they gradually become friends. Two years later, with Duval still out of work, he has an apparent chance meeting at a funeral with a former business acquaintance, De Grugy, who recommends Duval to Cl√©ment, the head of private surveillance company. Cl√©ment hires Duval to transcribe recordings of phone intercepts, but he insists on very specific work conditions. Duval's new workplace is an unfurnished apartment, where he must work alone every day from 9am to 6pm, transcribing phone conversations from cassette tapes, using only an old IBM Selectric typewriter. Any pages that have errors must be shredded; he is forbidden to leave the apartment during work hours or take any material away; he cannot smoke in the apartment, interact with anyone else in the building, or tell anyone about his work; and he is always paid in cash. At the same time, two major political events are underway - France is nearing a Presidential election, in which an Alt-Right candidate is standing against the incumbent, and the race is complicated by a political crisis involving a group of French citizens being held hostage in the Middle East. Although he initially pays little heed to the content of the tapes, Duval gradually becomes aware that they are evidently intercepted conversations with senior government officials - many involving a government official called Labarthe, and a Middle Eastern lawyer called Al Shamikh - and that all the taped individuals appear to have intimate knowledge of the hostage crisis. Duval is also surprised to discover that Cl√©ment is having him watched, and on several occasions he turns up for work to find typed notes from Cl√©ment, containing orders not to smoke in the apartment. Although the job is at first uneventful, and his life is getting back on track, things take a sinister turn after Duval transcribes a conversation between Al Shamikh and Labarthe, in which Al Shamikh claims to have notebooks that contain critical information about the hostage crisis. The tape ends abruptly with what sounds like a struggle and, soon after, Duval is shocked to learn that Al Shamikh has been murdered. He starts to have serious doubts about his work and decides to quit, but at this point he begins to be visited at the apartment by Gerfaut, who claims to work for Cl√©ment. Increasingly disturbed by the content of the tapes and their apparent connections to the hostage crisis and the murder of Al Shamikh, Duval tells Gerfaut that he wants to quit, but Gerfaut convinces him to wait. On a subsequent visit, Gerfaut demands both the cassette and the transcription of the Al Shamikh tape, and soon after he insists that Duval accompany him to Al Shamikh's office, where he intends to steal the notebooks. When they arrive, Gerfaut demands that Duval assist him, but when Duval refuses, Gerfaut turns on him and strangles him with the car seat-belt until he agrees to help. They enter the office and Duval keeps watch while Gerfaut searches for the notebooks, but Duval is surprised by a cleaner entering the office, and to Duval's horror, Gerfaut brutally knocks the cleaner to the ground and strangles him to death to prevent him identifying them. After realizing that the apartment does not contain the notebooks, a frustrated Gerfaut commands Duval to return home and stay there without answering anything. At home, Duval receives a call from Cl√©ment, who tells him to step into a car outside. The men in the car cover Duval's head, driving him to an unknown location. He is led into a house where Cl√©ment interrogates him briefly about his interactions with Gerfaut and his knowledge of the notebooks' whereabouts. Cl√©ment then leads Duval into a bare room where he sees Gerfaut, tied to a chair and bleeding from numerous wounds. Cl√©ment demands to know where the notebooks are, but Gerfaut is defiant and refuses to say, and it is clear that Cl√©ment will to kill him either way. Duval is told that Gerfaut used to work for Cl√©ment but is now working on his own, and he also realises that Cl√©ment has had him under close surveillance the whole time but, to his surprise, Cl√©ment orders him to return to work, and he is driven back to town. Panic-stricken, Duval returns home, determined to flee. He grabs his passport and all the cash he has saved from his job, and leaves his apartment, but within moments he is seized by two men and bundled into a car. These men, it transpires, work for the secret service. He is held for some time before being interrogated by two men, one of whom turns out to be Labarthe, the other voice from the Al Shamikh tape. Labarthe tells Duval that the secret service are investigating Cl√©ment's activities and want to find him, and he reveals that he has surveillance camera footage from Al Shamikh's office that shows Duval in the room with Gerfaut when he murdered the cleaner. Duval resists, pleading that Cl√©ment is watching them all, and that he knows from the tapes that Cl√©ment has been tapping Labarthe's phone, but Labarthe secures his cooperation by threatening to give his file to the public prosecutor. Arriving home, he is dismayed to see Sara waiting for him; at first he suspects she is in league with Cl√©ment, and he angrily demands to know how she knew where he lives, then orders her to leave, but then he collapses, she returns to assist him, and he tells her all that has transpired. The next day, Duval reluctantly returns to work but he is panic-stricken when he begins typing the next tape, and realises it is a recording of a conversation between himself and Labarthe, and that Cl√©ment still has them under surveillance. The terrified Duval rushes out to call Labarthe from a public phone, pleading that he is in mortal danger, and that Cl√©ment clearly knows all about Labarthe's investigation and is monitoring them both closely, but Labarthe orders Duval to stay put. Duval is taken in a car by Cl√©ment's men, which he narrowly escapes by attacking the driver and inducing a car crash. He rushes back to his home to find that it has been ransacked by Cl√©ment's men, who are searching for the notebooks, and he realises they have also kidnapped Sara, who had stayed the night there. Labarthe orders Duval to contact Cl√©ment and arrange a meeting, under the pretext of giving Cl√©ment the Al Shamikh notebooks he has been searching for. Labarthe also reveals that the notebooks don't really exist, and that he is merely using their supposed contents as bait to lure Cl√©ment out so that they can arrest him. Duval tries to find the secretive Cl√©ment, at first without success, but then he remembers Chalamont, the business friend who had originally recommended Duval for the job. He goes to De Grugy, who at first claims ignorance, but when the now-desperate Duval uses physical force to intimidate him, De Grugy relents, gives him Cl√©ment's phone number, and Duval arranges the meeting, which secures Sara's release. The climactic meeting takes place in an empty sports arena. Before they enter, Labarthe tries to allay Duval's fears by assuring him that they will be watched by his agents throughout the meeting. When Cl√©ment arrives, he and Labarthe dismiss their minders, and Cl√©ment makes a series of stunning revelations - he too works for a shadowy branch of the French security services, he has had Labarthe's agency under surveillance the entire time and knows all about his operation, and that he, Cl√©ment, is a close ally of the new \\"alt-Right\\" President. He also admits that the knows the notebook story was a ruse, and reveals that the delay in releasing the hostages was a deliberate ploy to discredit the defeated President, and give the kudos for securing the hostages' release to the incoming President. Cl√©ment then effectively blackmails Labarthe into acquiescence by telling him that unless he drops his attempts to stop Cl√©ment, he will have no future under the new administration. Labarthe hesitates, but to Duval's dismay he finally agrees to Cl√©ment's terms. The tables are dramatically turned when Duval takes matters into his own hands - he seizes Labarthe's wrist, which has a microphone to communicate with his agents, and he shouts \\"Engage! Engage!\\". Labarthe's agents take this as an order and the sharpshooters open fire, killing Cl√©ment and his bodyguards. A stunned Labarthe realises the game is over and Duval is released. As he walks out of the arena, we hear news voice-overs of the successful release of the hostages. The film concludes with Duval going to the hospital where Sara has been recuperating from her ordeal, and the final scene depicts Duval and Sara looking at each other across the hospital corridor. The movie ends at this point, without revealing whether or not their relationship will continue.

It follows the life of figure skater Tonya Harding and her connection to the 1994 attack on her rival Nancy Kerrigan. The film states that it is based on \\"contradictory\\" and \\"true\\" interviews with Harding and her ex-husband Jeff Gillooly, suggesting they are unreliable narrators. It features darkly comedic interviews with the characters in mockumentary-style, set in the modern day, and breaks the fourth wall. Margot Robbie (who also co-produced) stars as Harding, Sebastian Stan as Gillooly, and Allison Janney as Harding's mother LaVona Golden. Julianne Nicholson, Caitlin Carver, Paul Walter Hauser, and Bobby Cannavale also star. Loosely based on actual events, the movie depicts Harding as a victim, reframing the narrative around her implication in the crime as well as other criticism of her actions. I, Tonya premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2017, and was theatrically released in the United States on December 8, 2017, and grossed $53.9 million worldwide on an $11 million budget. It received positive reviews, with praise for Robbie and Janney's performances. At the 90th Academy Awards, Janney won for Best Supporting Actress, while the film also earned nominations for Best Actress for Robbie and Best Film Editing. It earned three nominations at the 75th Golden Globe Awards, winning Best Supporting Actress for Janney, and at the 24th Screen Actors Guild Awards, it won Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role for Janney and was nominated for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role (Robbie). At the 71st British Academy Film Awards, the film earned five nominations, winning Best Actress in a Supporting Role for Janney. Plot In 1974 Portland, Oregon, four-year-old Tonya Harding is forced to ice skate by her abusive mother, LaVona Golden. As Tonya grows up, her parents take her out of school to focus on her skating career, as she trains under coach Diane Rawlinson. Tonya rapidly becomes one of the best figure skaters in the United States, but is held back by her \\"white trash\\" reputation, home-made costumes and unconventional choice of performance music (e.g., ZZ Top). At 15, she begins dating 18-year-old Jeff Gillooly. They marry, but Jeff becomes abusive. When LaVona scorns Tonya for putting up with it, Tonya blames LaVona for her raising her badly. After a dispute with Diane, Tonya fires her and hires Dody Teachman as her new coach. Tonya becomes the first female figure skater to complete two triple Axel jumps in competition. At the 1992 Winter Olympics, Tonya fails to stick her landings and finishes fourth. Defeated, she moves in again with Jeff and takes a job as a waitress, but Diane convinces her to train for the 1994 Winter Olympics. On the day of her November 1993 competition at the Northwest Pacific Regional Championships in Portland, Tonya receives a death threat and chooses not to compete. Realising that he can sabotage Tonya's competition, Jeff instructs his friend Shawn Eckardt to send death threats to Tonya's rival Nancy Kerrigan. Tonya makes a phone call trying to locate Kerrigan's training arena and her practice times. Eckardt hires two inept crooks to attack Kerrigan after a practice session in Detroit. On January 6, 1994, Eckardt's henchmen strike Kerrigan's knee; she cannot compete at the next day's National competition. The hired henchmen are arrested. Eckardt's bragging quickly leads the FBI to him. He blames Jeff, who is horrified to learn that Eckardt gave orders beyond sending the letters. Tonya qualifies for the Olympic team but realizes she will be found guilty by association. She goes to the FBI and tells them what Jeff and Eckardt did, but they show her interview transcript to Jeff after his arrest, and he races home to confront her. She briefly speaks to Jeff, then climbs out the window, leaving him for good. Jeff later implicates Tonya, saying she knew about the attack. LaVona visits Tonya and offers her kind words; however, when LaVona asks if Tonya knew anything about the crime, Tonya realises she is wearing a wire and throws her mother out. Jeff, Eckardt, and the henchmen are charged, with Tonya's hearing postponed until after the Olympics. Tonya finishes eighth and Nancy Kerrigan wins the silver medal. Tonya avoids jail but is banned from competitive figure skating for life. Heartbroken, she begs the judge to give her jail time but not to take away the one thing she knows how to do; the judge refuses. Jeff acknowledges that he ruined Tonya's career. He changes his name, remarries, opens a hair salon, divorces, and remarries. LaVona moves to Washington state and has no contact with Tonya either. Tonya remarries, divorces, takes up professional boxing, and becomes a landscaper, house painter and deck builder. She now lives happily with her seven-year-old son and third husband. Cast Production Screenwriter Steven Rogers was inspired to write the film after watching a documentary about ice skating which mentioned Tonya Harding. Rogers arranged separate interviews with Harding and her ex-husband Jeff Gillooly. They remembered the events of the 1994 scandal very differently. Rogers decided, \\"Well, that's my way in - to put everyone's point of view out there, and then let the audience decide.\\" He later said that the film was really about \\"things we tell ourselves in order to‚Ä¶live with ourselves‚Ä¶how we change the narrative, and then want that to be the narrative.\\" Regarding Gillooly, Rogers stated, \\"What's curious about Jeff is that he refused to take any money for life rights, for his interview, for anything.\\" He remembered Jeff Gillooly saying that Harding was a great figure skater. According to Rogers, Gillooly also said that it was his own idea to threaten Nancy Kerrigan's ability to perform and took responsibility for his part in Harding's 1994 ruin: \\"he doesn't want to profit from it.\\" Margot Robbie, who played Harding and co- produced the film, did not realize the screenplay was based on a real event until after she finished reading it. Immediately prior to filming, Robbie flew from Los Angeles to Portland, Oregon to meet Harding. To prepare for the skating scenes, Robbie trained for four months. Heidi Munger and Anna Malkova served as skating doubles and Sarah Kawahara provided coaching and choreography. Rogers wrote the role of Tonya's mother LaVona for Allison Janney; she is a longtime friend of Rogers, but the \\"stars had [not] aligned\\" for them to work together until he completed the script for I, Tonya. Janney said the part was one of the most challenging of her career. Shortly after the film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival, she said, \\"I think LaVona was actually a very smart woman, very articulate... [...] She was not messing around and didn't want [Tonya] distracted... [...] She wanted [Tonya] to know that it was going to be hard work, and knowing her daughter needed to be told she couldn't do it in order to do it was LaVona's way of saying, 'I was there to inspire her'.\\" Director Craig Gillespie was interested in the project because he \\"realized it was a great opportunity to revisit the story and make a commentary about how the media treats people.\\" He did add that he didn't \\"feel great about having to drag Nancy's name back into this.\\" Gillespie said that he tried, in the film, to present Harding \\"in a very honest way\\" without \\"trying to pull those heartstrings... just showing you why she is the way she is.\\" Principal photography began in late January 2017 in Macon, Georgia, where Macon Coliseum was used as a set. Throughout the shoot, Robbie suffered from a herniated disc in her neck and had routine MRIs to ensure it was safe for her to continue filming skating scenes. Filming wrapped in late February of that year, with pickups in Atlanta on May 16. Music Some of the songs of the soundtrack were used in Harding's real routines, such as ZZ Top's \\"Sleeping Bag\\". Others were selected by music supervisor Susan Jacobs: tracks from 1970s such as Fleetwood Mac's \\"The Chain\\" or Supertramp's \\"Goodbye Stranger\\" came from an era when music was \\"powerful and full\\" and \\"warm.\\" Jacobs felt the \\"classic rock songs filled the picture without getting in the way of the story.\\" Critic Emily Manning found that others, such as En Vogue's \\"Free Your Mind\\" and Heart's \\"Barracuda\\", created \\"an interesting parallel between Tonya's tenacity and ambition.\\" The film ends with Siouxsie and the Banshees' cover of \\"The Passenger\\"; Manning wrote: \\"There was something really right about seeing Tonya skate to Siouxsie.\\" Jacobs said that \\"The Passenger\\" was \\"something obviously female and the lyrics [resonated]\\". The lyrics of Dire Straits' \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" were also important as \\"they felt like the story\\". A soundtrack was released on December 8, 2017, by Milan Records, featuring songs used in the film by various artists and tracks from the original score. Track listing original score track Additional songs featured in the film Release Allison Janney (left) and Margot Robbie (right) promoting the film The cast of I, Tonya at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival I, Tonya premiered at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2017. Shortly after, Neon and 30West acquired domestic distribution rights to the film. It was theatrically released on December 8, 2017. In January 2018, Dan Shaughnessy, columnist for The Boston Globe, asked Nancy Kerrigan in a telephone interview if she had seen the film ‚Äì she had not. When Shaughnessy posited that Kerrigan was once \\"a victim of Harding's dysfunctional life\\", she agreed but emphasized that she was occupied with living her own life. Shaughnessy also asked Kerrigan to comment on whether she was \\"bothered by Hollywood's portrayal of Tonya\\"; she replied that the issue was no longer her business. Nancy Kerrigan said that her only \\"role\\" in the 1994 scandal was recovering from an attack, \\"That's it\\", she finished. She went on, during the interview, to speak about how she remembered the scandal as \\"A bizarre thing. The whole thing was crazy, being that it's a story. I mean, come on.\\" Home media The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on March 13, 2018. Reception Box office I, Tonya has grossed $30 million in the United States and Canada, and $23.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $53.9 million. After making $11.6 million over a month in limited release, the film made $2.9 million from 799 theaters in its wide weekend. After the film earned its three Oscar nominations, it was added to 161 theaters the following week and made $3 million. Critical response On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, I, Tonya holds an approval rating of 89% based on 377 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \\"Led by strong work from Margot Robbie and Allison Janney, I, Tonya finds the humor in its real- life story without losing sight of its more tragic ‚Äì and emotionally resonant ‚Äì elements.\\" On Metacritic, which assigns a rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 77 out of 100, based on 47 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Christy Lemire of RogerEbert.com described it as \\"an irresistible, soapy mix of jealousy, competition and class warfare, fortified by powerful performances and unexpected emotional resonance.\\" Lemire also complimented Gillespie for \\"what would seem to be an impossible high-wire act: He's made a movie that's affectionately mocking‚Äîof this theatrical sport, of the idiots who surrounded Harding, of this hideous moment in fashion and pop culture‚Äîwithout actually mocking Harding herself.\\" In Rolling Stone, Peter Travers wrote that the film holds \\"a mirror up to the class-conscious America most of us tend to ignore or dismiss ‚Äì and makes us see ourselves reflected in it, too. I, Tonya is funny as hell, but the pain is just as real. You'll laugh till it hurts.\\" Vulture praised Robbie's performance, feeling she had found a new \\"weight\\". Ty Burr of The Boston Globe wrote that it was one of the most surprising films of the year - a \\"multi-layered saga of talent and class resentment\\". He praised Rogers' script as \\"sympathetic but clear-eyed, foul- mouthed but fair-minded\\". Burr wrote that the domestic abuse scenes are presented effectively because of the film's style of \\"ironic as-told-to comedy that intentionally curdles when the extent of [violence]...and Harding's grim acceptance...of it become obvious\\". However, when writing of the scene where Harding voices how she has internalized a victim-like identity, Burr believed the filmmakers failed to appreciate the scope of what that really means to her. He considered whether the filmmakers had an obligation not to be among \\"the many vultures picking at [Tonya's] pop-culture corpse\\". Burr did not think the filmmakers properly addressed the predicament of making a film about Harding's media over-exposure. Richard Brody of The New Yorker felt the film failed to find an original depiction of the working class, and \\"treats Tonya's background, her tastes, her habits, her way of talking, as a joke... The result is a film that's as derisive and dismissive toward Tonya Harding as it shows the world at large to have been\\". In The Guardian, Jean Hannah Edelstein felt that the film was \\"played for laughs\\" at the expense of its subject. Allison Janney was widely lauded for her performance as LaVona Golden, singled out for praise by critics. Christy Lemire of RogerEbert.com said: \\"Janney absolutely tears it up as the profane, chain-smoking LaVona Harding, constantly insulting Tonya and messing with her mind in the name of making her a champion. It's a showy, scenery-chewing performance but it's not one-note; Janney brings an undercurrent of sorrow to the part in revealing LaVona's twisted methodology.\\" Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post wrote that: 'Janney steals every scene she's in, playing LaVona, a harridan whose nodding goes beyond tough love.' Helen O'Hara from Empire called Janney's performance flawless and flamboyant, and an unforgettable one. USA Today said; \\"Janney is magnificent as Tonya Harding's villainous and abusive mommy dearest. No curse word goes unused and no scenery is left unchewed by the actress, who takes over whenever she's onscreen, whether dealing with a pesky parakeet or breaking the fourth wall.\\" Criticism The film received some criticism for taking liberties with facts in order to make Harding sympathetic. Reviewing the film for USA Today, Christine Brennan, who covered the real story in 1994, wrote that \\"the movie certainly doesn't worry about letting facts get in the way of a good story or bother to tell you that the only person Tonya has to blame...is herself.\\" In the Sonoma Index-Tribune and The Oregonian, J.E. Vader, who covered Harding's rise as a local up-and-coming hero, wrote a scathing review titled \\"I, Nauseated\\", in which she calls Harding an \\"unrepentant felon\\", \\"habitually 'truth challenged'\\", and added that \\"this fantasy film is Harding's dream come true\\". Accolades I, Tonya earned various awards and nominations following its release. At the 7th AACTA International Awards, Robbie won Best Actress, while Janney won Best Supporting Actress. I, Tonya received five nominations at the 71st British Academy Film Awards, including Best Actress in a Leading Role for Robbie, Best Original Screenplay for Rogers and winning Best Actress in a Supporting Role for Janney.

In his only season, Holden played for the Birmingham Black Barons before going on to join different semi- professional teams. Later on, Holden helped spread awareness about the history of Negro league baseball. Holden was born in Madison, Alabama, the son of parents Thornton and Mattie. As a teenager, he attended William H. Council High School, while playing for the semi-professional team, the Rocket City Dodgers, as an infielder. In 1958, he joined another club, the Huntsville Braves (later renamed the Hawks), and was positioned as the team's starting catcher. As Holden recollected, \\"They notice I was getting a little size on me...They were just looking for someone chunky who had a good arm on them\\". He played with the Hawks for two years before Holden started attending Alabama A&M; University in 1959, while playing college football briefly until a recurring knee injury sidelined him. During Major League Baseball's 1960 spring training, the Baltimore Orioles' chief scout Fred Hoffman invited Holden to participate, but injuries, again, plagued him during camp, prompting the Orioles to release him after a few weeks. Undettered, Holden underwent a training regimen and signed with the Birmingham Black Barons for $300 per month, earning two hits in his debut game. However, following the 1960 season he left the team, citing financial concerns as his reason to return home. In 1961, he rejoined the Huntsville Hawks for two more seasons. When the local American Legion post sponsored a team, Holden was elected team captain, playing between 1963 and 1968 before suffering an ankle injury. Following his baseball career, Holden established a successful small business and was active in spreading awareness about the history of the Negro leagues. In 2004, he was inducted into the Madison County Athletic Hall of Fame. He has a wife named Hattie and two children.

Purism manufactures the Librem personal computing devices with a focus on software freedom, computer security, and Internet privacy. In addition to hardware, Purism also maintains PureOS, an operating system along with Librem One, a social networking service based on open standards.  History  Purism was founded in 2014 with the start of a crowdfunding campaign for the Librem 15, an attempt to manufacture an Intel-based high-end laptop for Linux with \\"almost no proprietary software\\". A second campaign funded development of a 13-inch model with hardware switches to disable the microphone and camera as a privacy feature. Kill switches were also added to the 15-inch model. The two campaigns raised from 1,042 initial backers, and production began at the end of 2015. In 2017 Purism announced its transition from a build to order to a build to stock order fulfillment model. Purism reincorporated as a social purpose corporation in February 2017 and announced the change in May. On August 24 2017, Purism announced plans to build a smartphone, the Librem 5, with a baseband processor separate from the main CPU, with hardware kill switches for the baseband, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, camera, and microphone, and running only free and open-source software. A 60-day crowdfunding campaign raised for the phone.  Products   PureOS  Purism manages development of PureOS, a fully free Linux distribution based on Debian. PureOS mostly ships with software from the Debian software repository but has all software removed that violates Purism's guidelines and the GNU Free System Distribution Guidelines. PureOS was endorsed by the Free Software Foundation in December 2017. Librem laptops ship with PureOS by default and an optional Qubes OS Universal Serial Bus (USB) drive. Purism says that it is easy for Librem device owners to install alternative Linux distributions and that owners have the freedom to install any operating system that they desire.  Librem hardware  Librem has been the brand name used by Purism for all of their computer hardware products since the firm's first website in late 2014. The name is based on the French word libre for the English word free as used in the term logiciel libre for free software. Purism devices feature hardware kill switches to allow users to shut off the camera, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular or mobile broadband modem on devices that have one (or can be purchased air gapped). = Laptops = Purism's first products were two laptop computers. Since late 2015, they have made laptops of two sizes: Librem 13 and 15, featuring a 13 and a 15 inch screen, respectively. These products ship with Purism's own operating system, PureOS, a derivative of Debian GNU/Linux, and an optional Qubes OS USB drive. Purism does its best to remove Intel's Management Engine from its Librem laptops, considering it a security problem. Still, it was not able to completely avoid use of proprietary BIOS firmware, earning it criticism from the Coreboot and Libreboot projects (which are working on completely free firmware, but as of 2015 had not yet achieved support of the contemporary hardware that Librem was using). Since summer 2017, new Librem laptops are shipped with coreboot as their standard BIOS, and updates are available for all older models. In July 2020, Purism announced the Librem 14, the successor of the Librem 13. The Librem 14 features a 10th generation Intel processor, and will begin shipping in late 2020.  Comparison of laptops  = Tablet: Librem 11 = Purism has proposed a 2-in-1 PC, a convertible, hybrid, tablet-to-laptop computer: the Librem 11, sometimes termed Librem 10 or 12. It would have an 11-inch touchscreen in an 11.6-inch body with a detachable keyboard, and an optional docking station. Development on the device began in April 2016 and was suspended in October 2018 to focus on the Librem 5 smartphone. = Smartphone: Librem 5 = The Librem 5 is Purism's first smartphone. They began a funding campaign on 24 August 2017, for a $599 \\"security and privacy focused phone\\". The 60-day funding campaign aimed to collect , however the goal was surpassed two weeks early and concluded with US$2,677,609.10 raised, 78% over the goal. The phone's operating system is entirely free software: it comes with PureOS pre- installed but also supports Ubuntu Touch. Further, the baseband processor is separated from the CPU main bus and instead connected via a fast USB interface, thus isolated from the main CPU RAM bus. Also, the phone features hardware kill switches for the isolated baseband processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, camera, and microphone. The firmware for the cellular modem on the phone is proprietary. On September 24, 2019, Purism announced that the first batch of Librem 5 phones had started shipping. On December 6, 2019, Purism announced Librem 5 USA‚Äìthe same phone, with Made in USA electronic fabrication. Librem 5 USA. = Librem Key = The Librem Key is a hardware USB security token with many features, including integration with tamper-evident Heads Firmware. Heads helps to ensure that the Librem laptop's BIOS was not altered since the last laptop boot. The Librem Key also holds a one-time password storage (3x HOTP (RFC 4226), 15 x TOTP (RFC 6238)), integrated password manager (16 entries), 40 kbit/s true random number generator, and tamper-resistant smart card. The key supports type A USB 2.0, has dimensions of , and weighs .  Librem One  Librem One is a paid subscription, free-software social-networking suite launched April 30, 2019 to bring decentralized, privacy-respecting applications to a wider user base. The first components released were Librem Mail supporting OpenPGP standards using a K-9-based client; Librem Tunnel based on OpenVPN; Librem Social microblogging using Mastodon server and Tusky- based client software federated via the ActivityPub protocol, and Librem Chat using Element software federated via Matrix and XMPP.

Career Youth and college During Mendes' first three years of high school, he opted to play for D.C. United's academy as opposed to high school soccer, due to a U.S. Soccer ruling prohibiting players from playing both high school soccer and academy soccer. While playing for D.C. United's academy, Mendes tallied 25 goals and 17 assists in 45 matches with the team, which helped him earn NSCAA Club All-American honors in 2015. During his senior year of high school, Mendes opted to play high school soccer, and played for Washington-Lee High School's boys varsity soccer team. During the Spring 2016 season, he tallied 21 goals and had 12 assists with the Generals, helping them win a state championship over First Colonial High School.

It was originally listed as a threatened species on July 28, 1978. The loggerhead turtle is the most prolific species of sea turtle in U.S. coastal waters. Loggerhead Sea Turtle (Caretta caretta)  Background: Distinct population segments (DPS)  The loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) is geographically distributed into nine distinct population segments(DPS). The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services (USFWS), and the Department of the Interior ruled four DPSs as threatened and five DPSs as endangered effective on October 24, 2011. Loggerhead DPSs listed as threatened under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Commerce are: * Northwestern Atlantic Ocean DPS * South Atlantic Ocean DPS * Southeast Indo- Pacific Ocean DPS * Southwest Indian Ocean DPS . Endangered populations of loggerhead sea turtles are: * Mediterranean Sea DPS * North Indian Ocean DPS * North Pacific Ocean DPS * Northeast Atlantic Ocean DPS * South Pacific Ocean DPS The two of these distinct population segments of loggerhead sea turtles that fall within United States Territory are the North Pacific Ocean DPS(range defined as north of the equator and south of 60¬∞N lat.) and the Northwest Atlantic Ocean DPS(range defined as north of the equator, south of 60¬∞N lat., and west of 40¬∞W. long.).  North Pacific Ocean DPS  Fish and Wildlife service checking gillnet Off the coast of southern California NMFS, NOAA, and Department of Commerce prohibited fishing with large drift gillnet (DGN) gear in the loggerhead conservation area during the presence of El Ni√±o conditions in order to protect the endangered North Pacific Ocean loggerhead DPS. This ruling effective July 23, 2014 was intended to prevent bycatch of loggerhead sea turtles. A team including sea turtle biologists and oceanographers determined the presence of El Ni√±o conditions based on the ‚ÄúEl Ni√±o watch‚Äù issued by the Climate Prediction Center (CPC), anomalies found in sea surface temperature (SST) charts published by NOAA's Coast Watch Program, the presence of loggerhead sea turtles in the Pacific loggerhead conservation area, and reports of loggerhead strandings. The SST data showed higher than average temperatures during summer months off the coast of southern California. This same fisheries closure ruling due to El Ni√±o conditions was again implemented May 29, 2015, and then again June 1, 2016.  Northwest Atlantic Ocean DPS  Beach notice - loggerhead critical habitat is protected by law Critical habitat designation for the Northwest Atlantic Ocean DPS of loggerhead sea turtles specified 38 marine areas that include nearshore reproductive habitat, breeding areas, winter area, constricted migratory corridors, and Sargassum habitat. This ruling was made the NMFS, NOAA, and Department of Commerce effective August 11, 2014. Nesting beaches were identified as critical terrestrial habitat by Fish and Wildlife Services and the Department of the Interior within the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico, effective August 11, 2014.  Hawaii-based pelagic shallow-set longline fisheries  Illustration of longline fishing technique Effective January 11, 2010 the NMFS, NOAA, and Department of Commerce removed the limit on the number of fishing gear deployments for the Hawaii-based pelagic shallow-set longline fisheries and simultaneously increased the number of incidental interactions allowed with loggerhead sea turtles. This ruling stated that longline fisheries may not interact with over 46 loggerhead sea turtles a year, a number thought to not interfere with survival and recovery of loggerhead sea turtles. This ruling was revised March 10, 2011 to reduce the number of allowed interactions from 46 a year to 17, a revision aimed to protect the loggerheads and maintain fishery yield. November 18, 2011 the pelagic shallow-set longline fisheries in Hawaii reached the annual limit on physical interactions with turtles and was closed by NMFS. Incidental interaction limit for loggerhead turtles was increased from 17 to 34 interactions a year starting November 5, 2012.

They have been, and still are, referred to by various names, including bronco, broncho, and roughstock. The harder they buck, the more desirable they are for rodeo events. Roughstock breeders have long established strings of bucking horses with broodmares and stallions that have been bred and crossbred to more consistently produce the desired temperaments and athletic ability needed for bareback and saddle bronc competition. Bareback broncs are typically smaller, faster athletes whereas saddle broncs are heavier bodied athletes of great strength and endurance.  History   Etymology  The term comes from the Spanish language word bronco, meaning \\"rough\\" (adj), or \\"gruff\\" (n), which in Mexican usage also describes the horse.; [Spanish]; It was borrowed and adapted in U.S. cowboy lingo. It has also been spelled \\"broncho\\", though this form is virtually unknown in the western United States, where the word is most common. In modern English, the \\"o\\" is commonly dropped, particularly in the American West, and the animal is simply called a \\"bronc\\". Many other instances of cowboy jargon were similarly borrowed from Mexican cowboys, including words such lariat, chaps, and \\"buckaroo\\", which are in turn corruptions of the Spanish \\"la reata\\", \\"chaparreras\\", and \\"vaquero\\". The exact term also refers to the bucking horses used in rodeo \\"roughstock\\" events, such as bareback bronc riding and saddle bronc riding. Some dictionaries define bronco as untrained range horses that roam freely in western North America, and may associate them with Mustangs; but they are not necessarily feral or wild horses. The only true wild horses are the Tarpan and Przewalski‚Äôs horse. C. M. Russell Modern usage In modern usage, the word \\"bronco\\" is seldom used for a \\"wild\\" or feral horse, because the modern rodeo bucking horse is a domestic animal. Some are specifically bred for bucking ability and raised for the rodeo, while others are spoiled riding horses who have learned to quickly and effectively throw off riders. Informally, the term is often applied in a joking manner to describe any horse that acts up and bucks with or without a rider. In modern times, contractors that supply bucking horses for bronc riding events are called rough stock contractors. The silhouette of a cowboy on a bucking bronco is the official symbol for the State of Wyoming. In 2016, the Bucking Horse Breeders Association (BHBA) was founded to serve as a bucking horse DNA registry for the purpose of documenting and preserving the names and lineages of bucking horses.  Bucking behavior  Sorting bucking horses (roughstock) Bucking is an instinctual characteristic in horses which serves to protect them against predators. It is quite natural for new foals and young horses to frolic and buck playfully. When Cowboys run spurs up their necks they buck. Cowboys have a unique appreciation and respect for horses that can buck - it is a desirable trait in rodeo roughstock; however, outside the rodeo arena, bucking is an undesirable trait and considered bad behavior. Bucking has caused some people to fear horses, much of which results from a lack of familiarity with and knowledge about horses, including the necessary horsemanship skills to help them better understand the true nature of horses. Bucking Horse Breeders Association In 2016, Steve Stone co-founded the BHBA, a private company located in Vernal, Utah. He saw a need for a DNA registry for bucking horses, something similar to what the Professional Bull Riders (PBR), American Bucking Bull, and stock contractors had created for bucking bulls. He started tracing bloodlines of top bucking horses provided by rodeo producer Sankey Pro Rodeo, and stock contractor Tooke Bucking Horses. While researching, he noticed the recurrence of Sankey's foundation bucking horse sire, \\"Custer\\", who died in 1994. Custer was a better sire of bucking horses than he was a bucking horse, and had sired strong quality athletes with longevity. Stone also discovered that some 30 head of the bucking horses used for the 1996 National Finals Rodeo (NFR) were descendants of Custer, and at least 15 were provided by Sankey. Custer was thought to be sired by Gray Wolf, one of the stallions in the Tooke's bucking horse string. After the BHBA was founded, the remains of Custer and Gray Wolf were exhumed in order to register their DNA. It was then discovered that Gray Wolf was not the sire of Custer, rather it was Timberline, another stallion in the Tooke's string.

It is located near Roing in Lower Dibang Valley district. Etymology The name Bhismaknagar was coined by researchers who discovered the ruins in the 1970s. It was probably named as a result of sanskritization of a legendary king of the Chutias named Bhirmukka. As per Buranjis, the founder of the medieval Chutia kingdom Birpal called himself a descendant of king Bhirmukka. The Deodhai Buranji reads, Historically, it was popularly known as Kundil-nagara(being situated on the banks of Kundil river), Sadhayapura(the rulers being Sadhayapur-ishwar) and Che-lung in Tai Buranji(meaning Bar-nagar in Assamese and Great City in English). Location It is located in Lower Dibang Valley district. The campus of the old city is spread over an area of 2500 acres. History Bhismaknagar is an important ancient archeological site. It was built by a Chutia king during 8th century and late rebuilt by another Chutiya king named Gaurinarayan. Bhismaknagar must have been a strong hold of the Chutias (12th-16th centuries) but the excavations has been throwing new light on its much earlier antiquities, which confirms the presence of an earlier Chutia kingdom(founded by one named Asambhinna) as stated in Assam chronicles(7th century).The early medieval Chutia kingdom was founded by Asambhinna in about 640 A.D., p. 65-67 Bhismaknagar has been identified with Sadhayapuri (or Svadhayapuri), the political centre of the Chutiya Kingdom.It was probably repaired by the Chutia king Lakshminarayan as bricks with the name Sri Sri Lakshmi-Narayana were found in the site.Neog, Maheswar, A Ruling dynasty of Arunachal: Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute Vol. 58/59, Diamond Jubilee Volume (1977-1978), p.817 Being located along the bank of river Kundil, it was also popularly known as Kundilnagara. Architecture Fabricated from the burnt bricks gave this fort an impressive and remarkable top view and thus explores the dexterity of people of ancient era. This fort can still be signified as an astonishing work of art. The city is spread over an area of 10 square km. It is surrounded by a wall 4.5 meters high and 6 meters wide made using granite stone(6-9 courses)Gait, Edward. A history of Assam(2nd Edition). 1962, p. 16. and bricks on the east, west and south directions. In the north, the Mishmi hills provided a natural barrier. Although very less excavation has been carried out by the Arunachal government, preliminary excavations have revealed three tanks and two gates in the eastern and western directions.Raikar, Yashawant. Archeology in Arunachal Pradesh. 1980, p. 19. The Bhismaknagar central complex extended over an area of 1860 square meters and displays three halls, six ingresses and two extension rooms. There is also a 2 meters high stone wall inside the complex. The architecture of the fort displays the medieval culture. While quarrying the fort the enormous pieces of work of art like potteries, terracotta figurines, terracotta plaques and decorative tiles were preserved.

In 1867, the distillery was purchased by the Cork Distilleries Company (CDC), in an amalgamation of five Cork distilleries. Following the amalgamation, the distillery was mothballed for a period at the beginning of the 20th century. However, operations at the distillery were later resumed, with production of yeast, industrial alcohol and grain alcohol occurring at the distillery until the 1970s. Distillation ceased at the facility in 1975, when Irish Distillers, who at that stage owned the Watercourse along with several other distilleries in the Republic of Ireland consolidated its operations in a new, purpose-built distillery in Midleton. The name of the distillery lives on in the name given by Irish Distillers to a subsidiary which runs the Jameson Experience at the former Jameson Bow Street Distillery in Dublin and the Old Midleton Distillery in Cork. The Watercourse Distillery was where Cork Dry Gin, the most popular brand of gin in Ireland was originally produced. In the 1960s, Cork Distilleries Company launched a whiskey, called Hewitt's, which paid homage to the Watercourse's original owners. Unusually for an Irish whiskey, Hewitt's was a peated blend. However, this was later reformulated as an unpeated blend, before being discontinued in the 2004.  History  The Watercourse Distillery circa. 1886. In 1792, a partnership was established by two local butter Merchants, Thomas Hewitt and John Teulon, and London distiller Richard Blunt, which resulted in the construction of the Watercourse Distillery, between 1793-1794 on Watercourse Road, Blackpool, Cork. The distillery and the road on which it was located were named for their proximity to the Kiln river, a tributary of the River Lee which flows through Cork City. In 1799, Hewitt, Teulon and Blunt were joined by James Morrogh, as an equal partner in the firm, each having invested. By 1834, the other partners having left, the Hewitt's were left as the sole owners of the company, which by that stage traded under the name Hewitt & Co. In 1867, the distillery was purchased by the Cork Distilleries Company (CDC), in an amalgamation of five Cork distilleries. Due to declining whiskey sales, Cork Distilleries Company ceased distilling operations at the Watercourse in the 1880s, though the distillery continued to be used as a grain and malt store, malting facility and bonded warehouse. When Alfred Barnard, the British historian visited the distillery in the 1880s, he stated that over 6,000 barrels of casks of whiskey were maturing at the premises. Circa 1913, CDC began installing equipment for the production of yeast and industrial spirit at the distillery, with production beginning in 1916. The yeast produced at the distillery was marketed under the name \\"Terrier\\" by a separate company called the Cork Yeast Company (CYC), displacing imports from Holland; while the industrial alcohol, produced using a Coffey Still, was exported for use in explosives, demand for industrial alcohol in the United Kingdom having grown eight-fold during World War I. Subsequently, traditional distilling operations regained importance, with samples of grain whiskey produced at the Watercourse distillery during this period (1951), recently selling at auction for ‚Ç¨1,450. In 1954, the company was renamed as the Watercourse Distillery Ltd. In 1966, the Cork Distilleries Company merged with two of the other remaining Irish distilleries, John Jameson & Son and John Powers & Son to establish Irish Distillers. Following the merger, Irish Distillers chose close their existing distilleries, and amalgamate their operations at a new, purpose-built distillery in Midleton, County Cork, with activity at the Watercouse Distillery coming to a halt soon after. Having lain derelict for some years, much of the distillery was demolished in the mid-1990s during construction of the North Link Road. However, a former bonded warehouse built circa 1800, still stands on the site of the distillery.

Street addresses of the structures run from 307 to 622 North McEwan, 114-120 East Fifth Street, 102-202 West Fifth Street, 112-115 East Fourth Street, and 112-124 West Fourth Street. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. History In 1864, Bay City lumberman William McEwan purchased the acreage around the area that is now downtown Clare. In 1868, he established a logging camp just south of what is now the city, and began clearing timber. In 1870, the Flint and Pere Marquette Railroad extended their tracks through the area, crossing what was then known as the Isabella-Tobacco River State Road near McEwan's lumber camp. McEwen took this opportunity to plat out a city near the crossing, and by the end of 1870, a small collection of buildings had been erected in Clare, including boarding houses, a store, and a few private houses. The commercial district grew rapidly in the 1870s. In 1878, Clare had 700 residents, over 30 commercial establishments, two churches, and more industrial employers. In 1881, an opera house opened, and in 1885 the first brick building in the city was constructed. Public water mains and telephone lines were soon installed, and bu 1891 there were nearly 1200 residents in Clare, and it was incorporated as a city. Electrical service was introduced in 1894, and a number of important commercial brick structures were built in the downtown in the 1890s, culminating in Clare's largest commercial building, Alfred Doherty's no longer extant six-storefront on McEwen. In the early 1900s, two significant fires in 1904 and 1907 destroyed a number of buildings in the downtown area, most constructed of wood. However, the buildings were quickly replaced, and from that point on, all further construction was of brick. Additional smaller fires occurred throughout the rest of the 20th century, resulting in a steady trickle of new construction of individual buildings from the 1920s through until the 1990s. Further construction occurred in the 1930s along West Fifth Street, following the construction of the Clare City Hall Building. The downtown as a whole prospered until the 1960s, when the freeway bypassed the city. However, despite economic struggles, the downtown area has retained a substantial amount of business activity. Description The Clare Downtown Historic District is located in the commercial center of the city, along four blocks of North McEwan Street with adjacent portions of East and West Fourth and Fifth Streets. There are 51 buildings in the district, along with two additional structures and two other sites. Construction dates of the buildings range from 1873 to 2000; most are two stories, but heights range from one to four stories. The buildings are predominantly Neoclassical and Commercial Brick, with some Late Victorian, Mid-century modern, and later 20th century architectural styles. The southernmost portion of the district, on McEwen just south of the railroad tracks, includes a large elevator building. North of this, the heart of the district runs along McEwen between Third Street (where the railroad also crosses McEwen) and Sixth Street. The buildings along these three blocks are nearly all one- and two-story commercial buildings, standing side-by-side and fronting directly on the sidewalk. On the corner of McEwen and Fifth stands the Doherty Hotel, built in 1924, and the only four-story structure in the district. The original Doherty Hotel, along with its associated parking lot and modern addition, occupies the entire city block between Fifth and Sixth and between McEwen and Pine. North of the district, along McEwen, sits a large modern hospital complex. The district extends in both directions along Fifth Street. To the east, it includes the 1882 Herrick House, and upright-and-wing house now converted to commercial purposes. To the west, the district extends to encompass the US Post Office, Clare City Hall, and Clare Congregational Church (the last being independently listed in the National Register). The district also extends west along Fourth Street to encompass a group of commercial buildings.

It protects an area of cerrado vegetation on a large plateau which is important in replenishing the aquifers that supply warm mineral springs in the region. Location The Caldas Novas State Park is in the municipalities of Caldas Novas and Rio Quente, Goi√°s. It has an area of . The park is from the municipal center of Caldas Novas, and from Goi√¢nia. It protects a remnant of the cerrado biome surrounded by farms and urban areas. The park is elliptical, covering the large plateau of the Serra de Caldas and its sides, which form natural walls. The Serra is also called the Caldas Ridge or the Structural Dome of Caldas. It rises to about , although the surrounding terrain is at about . History The Caldas Novas State Park was created by law 7.282 of 25 September 1970. Objectives are to preserve the fauna, flora, springs and their surroundings, to protect natural sites of ecological and tourist importance, and to supporte managed use for leisure, education and scientific research. Decree 1.531 of 21 July 1978 gave administrative responsibility to FEMAGO, now SEMARH. In 1998 funding from Furnas Centrais El√©tricas in compensation for the environmental impact of the Corumb√° I Hydroelectric Power Plant was used to build infrastructure. This included the administrative headquarters, visitors' center and accommodation for researchers and guards. The park opened to visitors on 14 March 1999 on an experimental basis. All visitors had to be accompanied by guides. The buffer zone was established by administrative rule 69/2014. Geothermal aquifer The Serra de Caldas is one of the most important sources of recharge of the hydrothermal aquifers that are the main tourist attractions of the Caldas Novas and Rio Quente region. The municipalities of Caldas Novas and Rio Quente form the largest thermal waters tourist complex in the world. Groundwater from the plateau infiltrates through the soil and through faulted and fractured rocks, gradually warming as it sinks deeper, until at a depth of it is warmer than the average surface temperature. It then migrates up to the surface through fractures to form thermal springs. A 2005 study noted that the thermal aquifer water levels were dropping quickly due to excessive pumping by tubular wells. Visiting The park is open from 8:00 to 17:00 Tuesday to Sunday. There is a small entrance fee. There are two official trails with waterfalls, one trail through the cerrado vegetation, and three look-outs with a panoramic view of the city of Caldas Novas. All the trails are easy, but may be hot. The Cascatinha waterfall trail is less than and leads to a waterfall where visitors may swim or jump from the top of the falls. The Cascatinha lookout on this trail gives a beautiful view. The Pared√£o waterfall trail is and has little shade, so is best taken in the morning. From the waterfall some steep steps lead to the Pared√£o lookout, which gives a 360¬∫ view of the city. The short Diversiflora trail gives an interesting guide to the vegetation of the cerrado.

Eyenine began writing and recording music at the age of 16, being heavily inspired by acts including Eyedea, Sage Francis, Adeem and Atmosphere. In his twenties, Eyenine began touring the country with such acts as PT Burnem, Paulie Think, Ecid, Prhym8 and Farout. He helped found an upstart recording label called Flyrock Records which released multiple albums from various New England artists including The If In Life, Rio Bravo, The Nasty and others. After years of freestyling at the weekly Rap Night in Portland, Maine he entered and won two separate Ruckus Cup Classic battle tournaments. He also went on to win two separate Church of Providence battle tournaments hosted by B. Dolan and refereed by Sage Francis.

Dorr Forbes, a Civil War veteran with 33rd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment, from La Moille, Illinois, and his wife Eliza had a farm on the lake in 1877, probably growing cranberries. The farming was ruined by beavers and the family sold the land which later became the steel mill site (see below). The family also had a shingle mill on Juanita Creek.Juanita \\"remember when\\" map 1900-1918, derived from records and oral history, at Kirkland branch map file, King County Library System and a home on Juanita Bay, built in the 1880s in Madison Park, Seattle and moved across the lake by barge or boat. It was rebuilt in 1905. Steel mill Forbes Lake was the site of the Kirkland Steel Mill, built by the city's founder Peter Kirk, but it never produced any steel. The enterprise folded in the Panic of 1893. Juanita Bay Park Owl in Juanita Bay Park The wetlands where Forbes Creek enters Lake Washington are Juanita Bay Park, Kirkland's largest city park at . A Duwamish village was located there prior to 1830, and wapato tubers harvested in the wetlands. Inhabitants include large numbers of year-round and overwintering birds, including osprey, owls, bald eagles, herons and woodpeckers. As many as 1,600 birds have been counted at once in the park. The park also is home to many mammal species including beaver, muskrat, nutria, raccoon, river otter, weasel, and coyote. The Forbes Creek wetlands are noted as prime urban birdwatching areas by The National Geographic Society, Reader's Digest, and many Pacific Northwest guidebooks. The Juanita Bridge, built in 1891 and rebuilt in 1932, carried Market Street wagon traffic, later automobile traffic, across the wetland. It was converted to pedestrian-only use in 1974 when a new bridge was built slightly to the east.

Princeton, NJ. 1994. Generally accepted to be from the 9th century, the piece is now part of the collection of the Berlin State Museums. It must be added that the date and identification of this ivory, although probable, are not indisputable. Various historians have suggested that the piece, carved with religious iconographies and inscriptions, such as the name of an Emperor Leo, had been made during the reign of Leo VI the Wise (), and was probably handled in public ceremonies as a symbol of imperial and religious authority.Corrigan, Kathleen. \\"The Ivory Scepter of Leo VI: A Statement of Post-Iconoclastic Imperial Ideology\\". The Art Bulletin, Vol.60, No.3. 1978. Pp 407-416. Kurt Weitzmann on the other hand proposed that this ivory may have been made during the reign of Leo V the Armenian (). However, a recent analysis of the content of its inscriptions has shown that the connection with the coronation of Leo V is unjustified.Cutler, Anthony.\\"The Hand of The Master: Craftmanship, Ivory, and Society in Byzantium (9th-11th centuries)\\" p. 200. Original function Scholars have argued about the original function of this ivory, whether it was the tip of a scepter, or the grip on the lid of a casket containing a crown. However, recent scholars have argued that the ivory was in fact a ceremonial comb made probably for the Emperor Leo VI.Stephenson, Paul. \\"Byzantine World\\". New York. ed. Routledge. 2010. p. 305. Significance The Leo Ivory is the largest known ivory work of art made under the Macedonian Renaissance. It measures 10.2 x 10.0 x 2.1 centimeters, and it is carved in all four sides. The piece contains a dowel hole measuring 3.2 centimeters into its base, which some experts have suggested was perhaps attached to something else, and was designed to be handled. Manufacture While references in Byzantine texts to ivory after the sixth century are few, various historians have suggested that early Christian ivories such as the ivory plaque with the coronation of Emperor Leo VI's son, Constantine VII Prophyrogenitos, were made in an urgent effort to erase their peasant origins from the public memory, to legitimate the power of the Macedonian dynasty, and to communicate to the Byzantine society the ideology that their kingship was the will of God.Cormack, Robin. \\"Byzantine Art\\". Oxford History of Art. Oxford University Press. 2000. p. 134. The scarcity of ivory in the area, and its significance in the art of the Byzantine Empire and Church certainly encouraged its production.Osborn, Harold and Antonia Bostrom. \\"Ivories\\". The Oxford Companion to western Art. Ed. Hugh Brigstocke. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. Physical description The iconography carved in the front of the comb represents Christ in the center, surrounded by St. Peter on his left and St. Paul on his right. The iconography on the back represents the Virgin Mary crowning an Emperor, probably Leo VI, and assisted by the angel Gabriel. By this image of coronation, various experts have suggested the explicit willingness to show the divine approval of the imperial power on earth. Others have suggested that the ceremonial comb was made perhaps in order to celebrate the coronation of the Emperor Leo VI. However, due to the significance of the Psalms in the Byzantine liturgy of Pentecost, the three inscriptions bearing the Psalms 20 and 44 suggest that the comb was made perhaps for the celebration of Pentecost. The arches, niches, and windows carved on the ivory suggest a striking resemblance with the interior architecture of the east end of the Hagia Sophia cathedral.Evans, Helen C. and William D.

Berns.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102965/ Speak Of The Devil at the IMDB\\"Creature Features\\" by John Stanley, Copyright 1997, It was also released under the name The Ungodly.http://www.filmaffinity.com/en/film633348.html The Ungodly at Film Affinity Plot Reverend Jonah Johnson is a phony Louisiana Evangelist preacher, whose wife, Isabelle, uses his sermons to fleece their parishioners of their money. During his first satellite feed on TV, he pretends to \\"heal\\" a man in wheelchair as a man from the IRS watches, but he is soon interrupted by the police with a warrant for his arrest and a redneck father declaring he is the father of his daughter's unborn baby. Johnson flees the scene, also chased by the actor who played the phony paraplegic, and is soon caught by a local police officer, who lets him go because it would upset his widowed mother, a loyal Johnson supporter. Johnson and his wife flee to Los Angeles where they discover a derelict boarded-up house and start to rebuild their phony church. As they're buying the house from their realtor Mrs. Wigglesworth, the realtor's son, Bobby, tries to tell them about a cult who murdered a young girl in the house but is shushed up by his mother. Their first night in the house, the Johnsons encounter a possessed toilet with smoke coming out of it and a gang of \\"punkers\\" hiding drugs in the house, who are scared away by Steve Seligman, a police officer. Johnson also has dreams of the demonic little girl. The next day they hire Mexicans to clean up and restore the house, one of whom is abducted and killed by a demon living in the house, his screams covered up by a power saw. The lady realtor soon returns to reveal to Jonah that his check bounced since the IRS froze his bank accounts. The IRS agent from Louisiana returns also having tracking down. Broke and needing money, the Johnson's encounter a mysterious woman, Lady Caligari, who gives them a briefcase filled with cash. Rabbi Ben Tov, who lives next door warns them from accepting it, but Isabelle sends him away. Isabelle also gets a book of evil and in time starts getting more beautiful. She decides to use the book to open a Church of Latter Day Sin with the motto, \\"Sin today without guilt,\\" but Jonah prefers to stay loyal to God. They're rejoined by old cohort, Mort, and Jonah's innocent niece, Eve. Meanwhile, the punkers resolve to get their house back and crash the Johnson's first church gathering which includes the realtor and her son. During the gathering, the demon in the basement appears, urinates on the pulpit and escapes through the window from Jonah. Before it departs, it grants the punkers wish that the police harassing them at the park get killed, Mort the ability to see the future and Isabelle continued money, fortune and power. Jonah meanwhile is getting increasingly disillusioned with Isabelle's direction with his church, unaware that the Devil has asked for his soul from Isabelle. The next day, the punkers encounter the cops at the park that have been harassing them and watch as they die in a crash with a garbage truck that crushes them. After Maggot, their female member, gets the larger bust size she had wished for, they realize they're getting what they want and join Isabelle's church. Eve meanwhile has visions of the demonic girl and the devil in the house. As Jonah keeps having doubts, Isabelle keeps stringing him along to keep him in control. By now, the church has started having ritual sacrifices of chickens and goats, and Isabelle uses Mort's visions of the stock market to further her wealth. She also hears of a display of museum artifacts involving devil worship and Count Dracula and has the punkers steal them for her own collection. They're traced to the church by Officer Seligman, who becomes smitten with Eve. He tries to arrest them, but Mort reports a phony terrorist report and has to let them go. That night, the gathering at the church with the relics culminates with an orgy and the death of one of the punkers who impales himself on one of the artifacts. After the young man's death, Jonah starts fearing the price for all the blasphemy and wants to quit and turn himself to the police. He tries getting guidance from the other local ministry, but none of them are of any help. He turns to Rabbi Ben Tov, who tells him only an act of self-sacrifice will cleanse his spirit. The Devil by now orders Isabelle to sacrifice Eve to break Jonah's spirit. Eve also runs into Officer Seligman, who spots her wearing one of the stolen relics. He turns to Rabbi Ben Tov, his old mentor, for guidance, knowing that without a search warrant, he can't investigate the church. When the Rabbi tries to exorcise the house with his shofar, he gets distracted by Maggot and gets killed by the demon. When it also threatens Eve, Mort doses her with chloroform for her sacrifice. That night, Bobby, the realtor's son, discovers Eve and hides her in the closet to save her life. His mom gets confused before the sacrifice as the punkers look for Eve and take her from Billy. Maggot brings Officer Seligman to the house as Jonah refuses to sacrifice Eve, even with Mort ordering him. He conjures up the Devil himself to force Jonah's hand, but Jonah impales himself and the Devil standing behind him with a sword. A fire erupts as Seligman saves Eve using his mentor's lost shofar and the house burns down after demons drag Isabelle and Mort to Hell. The third of a string of plumbers show up to try fixing the cursed toilet. The next morning, Jonah emerges alive from the house which still has the cursed toilet having survived unscathed. Having found God, Jonah resumes his ministry even as the Southern cop who let him escape Louisiana disputes him. Watching him on TV, the officer's elderly mother (Beverly Polcyn), however, punches her son after Jonah heals her arthritis.

Art historian Linda Nochlin interpreted Black Iris as a morphological metaphor for female genitalia. O'Keeffe rejected such interpretations in a 1939 text accompanying an exhibition of her work by writing: \\"Well‚ÄîI made you take time to look at what I saw and when you took time to really notice my flower you hung all your own associations with flowers on my flower and you write about my flower as if I think and see what you think and see of the flower‚Äîand I don't.\\" She attempted to do away with sexualized readings of her work by adding a lot of detail. It was first exhibited at the Intimate Gallery, New York from January 11‚ÄìFebruary 27, 1927, where it was catalogued as DARK IRIS NO. 3. Unlike her previous shows, this show was largely devoid of the colourful paintings for which she had received critical acclaim. Lewis Mumford commented: \\"Yesterday O'Keeffe's exhibition opened ‚Ä¶ the show is strong: one long, loud blast of sex, sex in youth, sex in adolescence, sex in maturity, sex as gaudy as \\"Ten Nights in a Whorehouse,\\" and sex as pure as the vigils of the vestal virgins, sex bulging, sex tumescent, sex deflated. After this description you'd better not visit the show: inevitably you'll be a little disappointed. For perhaps only half the sex is on the walls; the rest is probably in me.\\" The painting remained in the collection of the artist from 1926 to 1969. It was on extended loan to the Metropolitan Museum of Art from 1949 to 1969, when it was donated as part of the Alfred Stieglitz Collection to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

She implements black, purple, and maroon to detail the center and lower petals of the iris, while using pink, gray, and white when detailing the upper petals of the flower. O'Keeffe blends outwardly in order to soften the outer edges of the painting. With the use of white and other bright colors, she is able to bring light into the image, despite the lack of a light source. O'Keeffe was intent on light and its importance in presenting the organic beauty of her subjects. Her art demonstrates her belief in the inner vitalism of nature and her association of this force with light.Lynes, Barbara Buhler and Russell Bowman.

It originates from the area of Mechelen (), in the province of Antwerp in Flanders, for which it is named. It was created in the nineteenth century by cross-breeding local cuckoo-patterned farm chickens with various different types of imported Oriental chicken. With the Jersey Giant, it is among the heaviest of all chicken breeds. It is valued for the quality of its meat, which is pale in colour and fine-textured. History The Malines originates in the southern part of the province of Antwerp and the northern part of the province of Brabant, in eastern Flanders. It derives from cross-breeding of local cuckoo- patterned farm chickens with several of the various types of Oriental chicken that began to be imported to Europe in the nineteenth century. From about 1852, cuckoo-patterned local chickens were crossed with birds which had been brought from Shanghai, China, to the zoological gardens of Antwerp. Later, Brahma, Langshan and Cochin birds were also used. The resulting birds had the large structure of the Oriental chickens, but retained the meat quality of the local stock. Selective breeding for type and colour began in 1891, and in 1898 the Malines received official recognition. In the early twentieth century the Malines became famous under the name \\"Poulet de Bruxelles\\", and was in great demand for the quality of its meat, which is white and finely textured. After the Second World War, when competition from imported specialised meat breeds became more intense, its popularity faded. In 2010 there were 575 breeding birds in Flanders. A variant of the Malines, the or (roughly, \\"turkey-headed Malines\\") was created by cross-breeding with the Combattant de Bruges game breed, and has an unusual triple comb. It was created in the early twentieth century in response to demand from Germany for still heavier birds, and is heavier than the single-comb Malines. It is reported as a separate breed; in 2013 there were 88 in total. A bantam Malines was independently developed by two breeders in 1990. It is not widespread. Characteristics The Malines is a massive bird, among the heaviest of all chicken breeds. The comb is usually single; the legs are pale and slightly feathered. In Belgium, eight colour varieties of plumage are recognised; in Germany there are nine. Use The Malines is reared mainly for its meat, which is fine, pale, and close- textured. Hens lay about 140‚Äì160 tinted eggs per year, with a weight of about They are good mothers and excellent sitters. See also *Poularde References Further reading * J.-M. Larivi√®re, J. Detilleux, P.

His is credited with 2 aerial victories. Early life Colin Hodgkinson was born on 11 February 1920 at Glencot House near Wookey Hole in Somerset. His father was the first-class cricketer and airman Gerard Hodgkinson. Considered a \\"difficult and unruly\\" child, he was sent to Pangbourne College for a nautical cadetship. In 1938, aged 18, he was accepted into the Fleet Air Arm to undergo pilot training as a midshipman.Colin Hodgkinson obituary from Daily Telegraph quoted on website forum. Training and accident Hodgkinson carried out training aboard the aircraft carrier in the De Havilland Tiger Moth. He had completed some 20 hours of flying, including solo flights. On 12 May 1939 he was practising blind flying at RAF Gravesend, with a hood over his head. At an altitude of 800 feet his Tiger Moth struck another aircraft and plummeted to the ground. The crash killed his 28-year-old trainer, Fg Off John Fyrley Spanton, and seriously injured Hodgkinson. He was rushed to hospital, where his right leg was amputated above the knee and his left leg below the knee. He was transferred to the Royal Naval Hospital in Chatham to recover. During this period he was introduced to the surgeon Archibald McIndoe, who convinced him to have plastic surgery on his burned face, so making him a member of McIndoe's \\"Guinea Pig Club\\". By Christmas 1940, just over a year after his accident, he was walking on artificial limbs to such a standard that he was allowed back into the air. He subsequently joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve and went on numerous flights, including as a rear gunner on a bomber. Royal Air Force service Hodgkinson was determined to pilot aircraft again. He was sure he could emulate his fellow double-amputee Douglas Bader and fly Spitfires given the chance. In September 1942 he successfully requested to transfer to the Royal Air Force as a Pilot Officer and took control of his first Spitfire by the end of the month. After training he was posted to No. 131 Squadron RAF. His first aerial victory was claimed in April 1943, when on combat patrol on the south-east coast of England. He spotted four Focke-Wulf Fw 190s bombing the town of Brighton. Engaging them, he managed to disable one, which crashed into the sea near to Brighton Palace Pier. Later in the year he was promoted to Flying Officer and posted to No. 611 Squadron RAF. In August 1943 was escorting American B-26 Marauders home from a bombing run on Bernay Airfield in southwest France. The formation came under attack from more than 50 Fw 190s. In the ensuing dogfight he claimed his second aerial victory. Second accident and capture Hodgkinson was then posted to No. 501 Squadron RAF as Flight commander. In November 1943, during a high-altitude reconnaissance mission over France, his oxygen supply failed, causing him to crash land in a field. He was dragged from his burning Spitfire by two farm workers, losing an artificial leg in the process. For the next 10 months he was held in Stalag Luft III prisoner-of-war camp, before being repatriated and deemed \\"no further use to his country\\". He was again treated by McIndoe and he continued to fly until his release from service in 1946. Post-war Three years later Hodgkinson re-joined the RAF as a Royal Auxiliary Air Force pilot with both No. 501 Squadron RAF and No. 604 Squadron RAF. These squadrons were converting to jet-engined aircraft, and Hodgkinson flew the de Havilland Vampire until the early 1950s. He moved to Worminghall in Buckinghamshire into what he described as two rambling thatched cottagesBest Foot Forward. Colin Hodgkinson known as Nutkin Thatch, and subsequently worked in public relations. In the 1955 General Election he stood as the Conservative Party candidate for South West Islington, ultimately losing to Labour. In 1957 he published his autobiography, Best Foot Forward.

LuLaRoe was founded in 2012 by Deanne Brady and her husband Mark Stidham, and is currently based in Corona, California. As a multi-level marketing company, LuLaRoe recruits independent distributors (referred to by the firm as \\"fashion consultants\\") to sell products directly, often through social media. LuLaRoe reported sales of approximately US$1 billion in 2016, which would have made it one of the largest firms in the multi-level marketing industry at the time, and by 2017, there were approximately 80,000 independent distributors selling the company's clothing. The company has received criticism and faced lawsuits from distributors and consumer advocates over several issues related to its business model, and for problems with the quality and design of its products. A class-action lawsuit filed in California in October 2017 and a lawsuit filed by the Washington State Attorney General in January 2019 accused LuLaRoe of being a pyramid scheme.  History  LuLaRoe was incorporated on May 1, 2013. The company's name was derived by combining the names of Brady's first three granddaughters; Lucy, Lola, and Monroe. In 2014, LuLaRoe added skirts and dresses to its product line. In mid-2014, LuLaRoe introduced a line of leggings, which would go on to become LuLaRoe's most prominent product. With 23 employees and 750 distributors, the company did $9.8 million in sales. By July 2015, the firm had 2,000 distributors. In an August 2016 interview, LuLaRoe's CEO Mark Stidham claimed that the firm was on track to exceed US$1 billion in sales, and that LuLaRoe had 26,000 distributors and was shipping approximately 350,000 units a day. By April 2017, LuLaRoe had more than 80,000 distributors.  Legal issues  In early 2017, a class-action lawsuit was filed against LuLaRoe by customers, who complained that the firm's proprietary point-of-sale software incorrectly calculated sales tax rates on interstate sales, and in jurisdictions that do not charge sales tax on clothing. These complaints, combined with complaints over poor quality, led to the company's Better Business Bureau (BBB) rating being downgraded to \\"F\\" in January 2017. In October 2017, a class-action lawsuit filed in California accused LuLaRoe of being a pyramid scheme. Plaintiffs in the suit allege the company engaged in \\"misconduct, including unfair business practices, misleading advertising, and breach of contract.\\" According to the $1 billion lawsuit, which LuLaRoe argues is baseless and inaccurate, the company allegedly advised its distributors \\"to borrow money [...] take out credit cards, and some were even asked to sell their breast milk\\" as ways to buy additional inventory. In January 2018, the National Down Syndrome Society (NDSS), a charity that had previously worked with LuLaRoe, ended its relationship with the company after a top distributor mocked people with mental disabilities during a livestream sale. The NDSS requested that LuLaRoe sever ties with the distributor, but LuLaRoe declined, stating that they accepted the distributor's apology. The video, and LuLaRoe's reaction to it, prompted widespread online criticism. In December 2018, in the midst of mounting debt, layoffs, and an exodus of top sellers, LuLaRoe was sued by its chief clothing supplier, Providence Industries, for nearly $49 million. The lawsuit claimed that LuLaRoe was insolvent and had not paid its bills for seven months, and accused founders Mark and DeAnne Stidham of hiding assets in \\"shell\\" companies to fund their \\"lavish lifestyle\\" and to \\"hinder, delay, and defraud the creditors.\\" In January 2019, the Washington State Attorney General's Office filed a lawsuit against LuLaRoe, as well as company CEO Mark Stidham and president DeAnne Stidham, alleging that the multilevel marketing company is an illegal \\"pyramid scheme,\\" making misleading income claims, and encouraging its consultants to focus more on recruitment than selling clothes to customers. In addition, LuLaRoe's chief clothing supplier, Providence Industries, also filed a lawsuit demanding a seizure of assets. In February 2019, amid hundreds of new complaints totaling 300 cases, the company once again received an \\"F\\" rating from the BBB. In October 2019, LuLaRoe announced it would be closing its distribution center in Corona, CA, relocating that part of the business to South Carolina, and laying off 167 people. In November 2019, LuLaRoe filed a countersuit against its former chief supplier, Providence Industries, seeking at least $1 billion in damages.  Business model  LuLaRoe clothing is only sold by the company through multi-level marketing distributors. These distributors purchase inventory from LuLaRoe wholesale, which they then resell to consumers. LuLaRoe distributors are required to purchase an initial inventory of clothing and marketing materials that cost between $4,925 and $9,000 () and are recommended to keep around $20,000 worth of inventory on hand. Distributors can be compensated from two potential revenue streams: from direct sales to customers, and from a commission based on sales made by \\"downline\\" distributors they recruit. According to the company's income disclosure statement, in 2015 the average annual commission earned from downline distributors was $85. LuLaRoe distributors sell LuLaRoe products through a party plan, through pop-up boutiques, or online using private groups that they have set up on Facebook. During a scheduled online event, LuLaRoe distributors use live-streaming video to present their current inventory to members of their Facebook group, with the distributor appearing on-screen to exhibit and describe each item. LuLaRoe distributors are disproportionately more likely to be in poorer rural areas than urban ones. An example cited by Quartz notes that LuLaRoe lists 10 distributors in Manhattan (population of 1.6 million), and 10 distributors in Pueblo, Colorado (population of 110,000). This is consistent with other contemporary MLMs, which have concentrated in rural areas that have been slower to recover from the 2008 economic crisis.  Products  LuLaRoe's main products are brightly patterned leggings, shirts, and dresses. The company's clothes tend toward modesty, based partly on the Stidhams's Mormon religious beliefs. LuLaRoe releases 5,000 copies of any given pattern, and once a product has sold out, it is generally not reissued. LuLaRoe distributors can choose styles and sizes, but not specific patterns, and each distributor is provided different products for their inventory. Distributors have noted that some patterns (known as \\"unicorns\\") are significantly easier to sell than others. The garments are manufactured in Asian and Central American factories via MyDyer, a Los Angeles-based apparel company that also produces for other retailers.  Product quality and return policy complaints  In late 2016, LuLaRoe began receiving many reports from customers that the firm's leggings ripped and developed holes easily, in some cases shortly after being worn for the first time. In January 2017, the BBB downgraded the company's rating to \\"F\\" in response to the company's failure to address complaints, as well as for issues with charging sales tax in places that do not levy sales tax on clothes. Customers also shared photos of the ripped leggings on social media, and created a Facebook group related to the complaints that had 16,000 members by March 2017, the same month a class- action lawsuit was filed against the company by a group of customers. LuLaRoe's head of production attributed the damage to a production process that weakens the fibers while softening them. By April, the Facebook group had 26,000 members. LuLaRoe's CEO initially downplayed the damage rates as statistically insignificant, but in response to the complaints, on April 24, 2017, the firm implemented new policies to make it easier for customers and distributors to receive refunds on defective merchandise. The BBB rating was still \\"F\\" . In August 2017, multiple distributors complained on social media that they had still not received the refunds promised to them by LuLaRoe. In September, LuLaRoe abruptly ended the changes to its return policy, which it had described as a \\"waiver\\". Distributors now receive only 90% of cost and pay for shipping and handling, along with other stricter stipulations. The change in policy prompted a backlash on social media, and a petition to grandfather in the old policies for distributors who were in process of canceling their distributorships. , some sellers had complained that they had not received their refund checks for returns made under the April 2017 policy. As of June 2020, LuLaRoe had a B- rating with the BBB.

It is an erect, spreading shrub with its branches densely covered with white, woolly hairs. Its leaves are rough and wrinkled and the flowers are tube-shaped with deep pink petals with wavy edges. Description Hemiphora uncinata is an erect, spreading shrub which grows to a height of with its branches covered with white, cottony hairs. The leaves are linear to lance-shaped, long, wide, with their edges curved downwards or under and often have a hooked tip. The upper surface is rough and wrinkled with small blisters and the lower surface is covered with woolly hairs at least when young. The flowers are deep pink and are arranged singly or in groups of up to three on woolly stalks long, in upper leaf axils. There are bracts long at the base of the flowers and which are glabrous on the inner surface and densely woolly outside, and there are shorter, glabrous bracteoles. The five sepals are long, and joined at their base to form a short tube. The sepals are woolly on the outside, linear to lance-shaped and remain attached to the plant after the petals have fallen. The petals are long and joined to form a wide tube long and wide at the top end. The petal tube has soft hairs on the outside but glabrous inside except for a densely hairy ring above the ovary. The five petal lobes form two \\"lips\\", the upper lip with two lobes joined for most of their length and the lower with three spreading lobes. The five lobes have wavy or irregularly notched edges and are roughly circular in shape, in diameter. The four stamens are shorter than the petal tube with the lower pair much longer than the upper pair. Flowering occurs in spring and the fruit is almost spherical, hairy, veiny and in diameter. This species is similar to Hemiphora exserta but has its stamens short and enclosed in the petal tube. Taxonomy and naming This species was first formally described in 1863 by Nikolai Turczaninow who gave it the name Chloanthes uncinata. The description was published in Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© Imp√©riale des Naturalistes de Moscou from a specimen collected by James Drummond. In 1870 George Bentham changed the name to Pityrodia uncinata and in 2011, Barry Conn, Murray Henwood and Nicola Streiber transferred four species, including this one, from the genus Pityrodia into Hemiphora. The specific epithet (uncinata) is a Latin word meaning \\"hooked\\". Distribution and habitat Hemiphora uncinata is mainly found in near-coastal areas between Perth and the Murchison River, but there are disjunct populations near Gairdner and between Hyden and Lake Cronin, in the Geraldton Sandplains and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic regions where it grows in sandy clay in depressions that are sometimes flooded in winter.

It produces and markets the Whistle GPS Pet Tracker, a device worn on a pet's collar that monitors its activity and location. In addition to pet owners, the devices have been used by veterinary researchers. Corporate history The idea for Whistle grew out of current CEO Ben Jacobs' experiences on petcare accounts at Bain & Company, and was developed with COO Steve Eidelman while researching the petcare industry for venture capital firm DCM. They hired Kevin Lloyd as CTO and the three founded Whistle in 2012. The company started with 20 employees and raised $6 million in a venture funding round led by DCM. Other investors included the former CEO of Mars Petcare and the president of Humane Society Silicon Valley. Whistle's first product, an activity monitor for dogs that tracked their exercise, was released in 2013. The company raised an additional $10 million in a Series A funding round and $15 million in Series B. A February 2014 agreement with PetSmart placed the Whistle device in all the company's stores and led to co-marketing efforts. Whistle also began working with veterinary schools to analyze the data collected from the app. For example, in 2014 the Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania used data from Whistle devices for their research on chronic pain conditions in dogs; and researchers at the College of Veterinary Medicine at North Carolina State University have used it to study epilepsy in dogs.

In January 2015, the company acquired Tagg, a competing startup based in San Diego, for an undisclosed sum for its battery life and location-tracking intellectual property, and Tagg's CEO, Scott Neuberger, joined Whistle. Tagg had started as a Qualcomm subsidiary in 2010 and released its tracking device one year before Whistle. By 2015, Whistle had distributed 100,000 devices and had about 40 employees. In April 2016, Whistle was acquired by Mars Petcare, the pet product subsidiary of the food and candybar maker Mars, for $117 million. Products Whistle produces and markets wearable monitoring devices for pets. The Whistle Activity Monitor, which is sometimes called a \\"Fitbit for dogs\\", tracks the duration, time, and intensity of a pet's exercise, then gives the data to users over Wi- Fi networks or to a phone app using Bluetooth. The GPS pet tracker is for finding lost pets. It also produces an alert if the pet's behavior changes, for example a reduction in sleep, indicating anxiety. The GPS and location tracking product was announced in May 2014.

Her second album Everybody Works was released on Polyvinyl Records in March 2017, which was preceded by Turn Into, an LP of demos that first gained her attention as a singer- songwriter. Early life Duterte was born in Walnut Creek, California, United States, and grew up in the middle class suburb in the East Bay. She is the daughter of Filipino immigrants, and cites her parents' immigrant background and cultural customs as major influences. Duterte grew up playing the trumpet and guitar, and began writing and recording music at the age of 12. She originally intended to attend a conservatory program for jazz but instead decided to focus on songwriting. After enrolling in community college and studying music production and recording, she began recording in her bedroom studio and self-released music under the moniker Jay Som, which was created from an online baby name generator and means \\"Victory Moon\\".  Career  In November 2015, Duterte released nine tracks on her Bandcamp page under the name Untitled. They began to receive attention online despite the fact that they were intended to be demos, and were eventually re-released twice as Turn Into, first under Topshelf Records and then Polyvinyl Records in 2016. Following Turn Into, Duterte opened for Peter Bjorn and John, Mitski and Japanese Breakfast. Everybody Works, Duterte's first proper album as Jay Som, was released March 10, 2017 under Polyvinyl and Double Denim Records. It was preceded by the song \\"1 Billion Dogs\\" in February. Duterte has said that the album's sound was influenced by Tame Impala, Yo La Tengo, the Pixies and Carly Rae Jepsen's E‚Ä¢MO‚Ä¢TION. Everybody Works landed on Best of 2017 lists from Pitchfork, NPR, Stereogum, Rolling Stone, Entertainment Weekly, Billboard and others. In January 2018, Duterte released \\"Pirouette\\" and \\"O.K., Meet Me Underwater,\\" singles that were recorded during the same sessions as Everybody Works but did not end up on the final track list. In June 2018, Duterte toured with The National in Dublin, Ireland. They also recently toured with the Alternative Rock band Paramore, and was their opening act for the second half of Tour 5. In September 2018, Duterte released a split EP Nothing's Changed with Singer/Songwriter Justus Proffit. Consisting of 5 tracks, all recorded in her home recording studio - where she also recorded Everybody Works. The follow-up to Everybody Works, Anak Ko, was released on August 23, 2019 via Polyvinyl.  Musical style and reception  Duterte performs all the music on her records herself and records in her own makeshift studio in her bedroom. She describes her musical style as \\"headphone music\\". Joe Coscarelli of The New York Times has described it as \\"D.I.Y. bedroom pop\\" and noted its intimate, lo-fi aesthetic. Pitchfork has described Jay Som as being intimate, and having the \\"crushing vulnerability\\" of Phil Elverum, and the \\"gloriously slick sound' of Carly Rae Jepsen. Liz Pelly of Time Out has described Jay Som's sound as \\"mesmerizing and multidimensional dream pop that favors reality over escapism, drawing from classic pop and funk\\". Pelly also described Duterte's singing as \\"low and languid\\". Duterte has stated that Phil Elverum's music has had a profound impact on her music. Karaoke, Yo La Tengo, and My Bloody Valentine have influenced Duterte's vocal style.

It was proclaimed under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 on 17 August 1972 for the purpose of protecting a stand of grass tree. While the crown land on which the conservation park was established had not been cleared for agricultural use, evidence of disturbance of the understorey in an open forest area and the associated presence of introduced grasses suggests that the land was ‚Äúpreviously grazed by domestic livestock.‚Äù In 1992, the conservation park was described as follows. Firstly, the soils within the conservation park are reported as being located in the ‚ÄúNaracoorte Environmental Association‚Äù which is ‚Äúcharacterised by calcarenite dune ridges overlain by dunes or sheets of mobile sand.‚Äù Specifically, the majority of the soils in the conservation park are ‚Äúdeep, acid, bleached sands with a yellow-grey B horizon‚Äù while a minority consist of ‚Äúshallower alkaline sandy soils of a reddish colour.‚Äù Secondly, land within the conservation park supported the following ‚Äúthree vegetation associations:‚Äù # a ‚Äúlow woodland ‚Äú of brown stringybark ‚Äúassociated with sandy soils of the stranded dune systems of the West Naracoorte Range,‚Äù #an ‚Äúopen forest - low open forest‚Äù of pink gum associated with a stoney limestone rise in the central part‚Äù of the conservation park and ‚Äúan understorey generally consisting of introduced grasses and pasture weeds such as Cape weed (Arctotheca calendula);‚Äù and #a ‚Äùsmall area‚Äù of ‚Äúopen forest‚Äù of South Australian blue gum in the south-east in the conservation park's south-east with ‚Äúan understorey of grass trees, Austral bracken (pteridium esculentum), and rice flower (Pimelea sp.).‚Äù As of 1992, the conservation park had ‚Äúvery little visitor use.‚Äù There were no facilities being provided for visitors apart from ‚Äúboundary access tracks‚Äù of width to its west, south and east boundaries.

During these periods of drought and famine, tens of thousands of inhabitants died from starvation and diseases. Background The Cape Verde islands have a generally hot semi-arid climate, with substantial rainfall limited to the summer months August and September. The driest areas are the low eastern islands (Maio, Sal and Boa Vista), and the southwestern parts of the more mountainous islands. The higher and northeastern, windward parts receive more precipitation. Agriculture strongly depends on the summer rains; in years with less rain, crop failure was common. The situation was further aggravated by unsuitable crop choice, overpopulation, overgrazing, soil erosion and inadequate response from the Portuguese colonial administration. Historical famines The following famines have been recorded: *1580-83, on Santiago, Maio and Brava *1609-11, on Santiago, combined with an epidemy of smallpoxCape Verde History Timeline, WorldAtlas *1685-90, around 4,000 deaths on Santiago *1704-12, on Santiago, Maio, Boa Vista, and Sal *1719-23, on Santiago, S√£o Nicolau, Maio, Sal, Boa Vista, and Fogo. The latter three islands were depopulated *1738-40, on S√£o Nicolau *1747-50, on all islands *1773-75, over 20,000 deaths on all islands *1830-33, around 30,000 deaths on all islands *1854-56, 25% of the population died *1863-66, between 20,000 and 30,000 deaths on all islands Famines in the 1940s Two of Cape Verde's worst-ever famines occurred in 1941-43 and 1947-48, killing an estimated 45,000 people. The hardest hit were the islands of S√£o Nicolau and Fogo, where resp. 28% and 31% of the population was killed. In 1946-48, Santiago lost 65% of its population. Several thousands of islanders emigrated, for instance accepting contract labour on the cocoa plantations of Portuguese S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe. Between 1900 and 1970, about 80,000 Cape Verdeans were shipped to S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe. The Estado Novo government of Portugal showed little interest in its African colony, and failed to take measures to improve access to fresh water, or supply food aid. In popular culture Fome 47 (\\"Famine of 47\\"), one of the best known songs by Cape Verdean musician Cod√© di Dona, relates the drought, famine and emigration to S√£o Tom√© in 1947. The third and final part of the novel Chiquinho by Baltasar Lopes da Silva is focused on the calamity of drought, a major problem in Cape Verde, which results in famine and many deaths.

As of 2017, he is Frederick Henry Leonhardt Professor at Rockefeller University and directs the university's Sackler Center for Biomedicine and Nutrition Research. Biography Breslow attended Columbia College, Columbia University, gaining AB (1963) and MA (1964) degrees in chemistry. He then studied at Harvard Medical School, receiving his MD in 1968. He worked in pediatric medicine at the Boston Children's Hospital (1968‚Äì70) and then held a post-doctoral position at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (1970‚Äì73). Human apolipoprotein E In 1973, he took up a post as head of the metabolism division of Boston Children's Hospital, as well as successively instructor, assistant and associate professor in pediatric medicine at Harvard Medical School. In 1984, he moved to Rockefeller University as a professor, and in 1986, was appointed Frederick Henry Leonhardt Professor at the Laboratory of Biochemical Genetics and Metabolism. In 2014, he was appointed director of the university's Sackler Center for Biomedicine and Nutrition. He also works at Rockefeller University Hospital as a senior physician and was physician-in-chief in the 1990s. Research Breslow's research has focused on the genetic factors that govern an individual's predisposition to develop atherosclerosis. He started to work on the genetics of cholesterol handling in the late 1970s, and in the early 1980s, with Vassilis Zannis, he was one of the earliest to dissect the different variants of human apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a component of very low- density lipoprotein. People with different ApoE variants are now known to have different risks not only of heart disease but also of Alzheimer's disease. In 1992, his group found that deleting the mouse gene for ApoE caused the animals to develop elevated blood cholesterol levels and atherosclerosis within around 6 months, on a normal diet. Nobuyo Maeda's group at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill also independently created ApoE knockouts (apoe‚àí/‚àí) that developed atherosclerosis at the same time. The ApoE knockout was the earliest mouse model of the disease, and has been widely used in atherosclerosis research. Human PCSK9 His group has subsequently researched other genes associated with atherosclerosis, and for example, in 2003, were among the first to identify and characterize PCSK9, which encodes an enzyme acting in a novel cholesterol regulatory pathway. Antibodies targeting PCSK9 were approved by the US FDA as a novel class of cholesterol-lowering drugs in 2015. Awards and honours Breslow is an elected fellow of the American Society for Clinical Investigation (1984), US National Academy of Sciences (1995), Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina (1996) and the Institute of Medicine (1997). He served as president of the American Heart Association ‚Äì using the position to lobby vigorously for more government funding for research into heart disease ‚Äì and has received several awards from the association, including their Lifetime Research Achievement Award in 2010. He has also served as vice president of the American Society for Clinical Investigation. He has won the E. Mead Johnson Award of the American Academy of Pediatrics (1984), the Heinrich Wieland Prize (1991) and the Bristol-Myers Squibb Award for Cardiovascular Research (2000). In March 2013, Rockefeller University organized a symposium entitled \\"Genetics of Lipid Disorders and Atherosclerosis\\" to mark his seventieth birthday.

The power to pardon offences to the US government was given to the chief executive in the US Constitution under Article II. Abraham Lincoln On December 8, 1863, in his annual message to Congress, President Lincoln outlined his plans for reconstruction of the South, which included terms for amnesty to former Confederates. A pardon would require an oath of allegiance, but it would not restore ownership to former slaves, or restore confiscated property which involved a third party. The pardon excluded office holders of the Confederate government or persons who had mistreated prisoners.Abraham Lincoln, Tuesday, December 8, 1863 (Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction) Congress, however, objected to Lincoln's plans as being too lenient and refused to recognize delegates from the reconstructed governments of Louisiana and Arkansas. Congress instead passed the Wade‚ÄìDavis Bill, which required half of any former Confederate state's voters to swear allegiance to the United States and also swear that they had not supported the Confederacy. The bill also ended slavery, but did not allow former slaves to vote. President Lincoln vetoed the bill. During his presidency Lincoln issued 64 pardons for war-related offences; 22 for conspiracy, 17 for treason, 12 for rebellion, 9 for holding an office under the Confederacy, and 4 for serving with the rebels.Ruckman, P.S., Jr., and David Kincaid, Inside Lincoln's Clemency Decision Making, Presidential Studies Quarterly, Vol. 29, No. 1, March, 1999, pg. 92 Under the terms of surrender for the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox Court House on April 10, 1865, General Ulysses S. Grant stipulated that \\"each officer and man will be allowed to return to his home, not to be disturbed by United States authority so long as they observe their paroles and the laws in force where they may reside\\". On May 5 the parole was extended so that soldiers from the 11 Confederate states, plus West Virginia, would be allowed to return home on their paroles but that \\"all who claim homes in the District of Columbia and in States that never passed the Ordinance of Secession (Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri included) have forfeited them and can only return thereto by complying with the Amnesty Proclamation of the president and obtaining special permission from the War Department\\".Headquarters Dep‚Äôtment West Va., Cumberland, Md., May 6th, 1865, General Orders No. 57 Andrew Johnson As Johnson assumed the presidency his attitude toward Confederate leaders seemed to signify punishment and prosecution for the rebellion. Many southern leaders fled the United States, going to Mexico, Canada, Europe and other countries. He doubled the number of exempted classes that had been exempted by Lincoln. Johnson's proclamation of May 29, 1865, for example, did not include anyone whose personal property exceeded $20,000. Several mitigating factors however led Johnson to greater clemency, such as the attitude of Lincoln for reconciliation and William H. Seward's similar leniency towards the former rebels.Dorris, Jonathan Truman, Pardon and Amnesty under Lincoln and Johnson, The Restoration of the Confederates to Their Rights and Privileges, 1861-1898, Univ. of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill, 1953, pgs. 313-315\\"President Andrew Johnson Pardoning Rebels at the White House\\", Harper's Weekly, October 14, 1865 Those excluded from general amnesty had the option of applying to the president for a special pardon, and much of Johnson's time was spent in granting those pardons.

Biography  Cocchia was born in Naples in 1900 and attended the Italian Naval Academy in Livorno, graduating in 1916 with the rank of Ensign. During World War I he served on board the battleship Conte di Cavour. In the 1930s he participated in the Second Italo-Ethiopian War and the Spanish Civil War, commanding MAS, submarines and torpedo boats. When Italy entered World War II Cocchia, with the rank of Commander, was the commanding officer of the submarine Luigi Torelli; he commanded the boat during its first mission in the Atlantic Ocean, after which he was assigned to BETASOM base in Bordeaux as Chief of Staff. After his promotion to Captain, he was repatriated, and in May 1941 he led the motley flotilla that carried and landed near Sitia (on the eastern coast of Crete), during the German invasion of the island, an Italian regiment sent as reinforcement to the German troops engaged in the battle. He was then appointed military commander of the island of Leros, a role he held until April 1942, when he was replaced by Captain Luigi Mascherpa. In April 1942 he was given command of the destroyer Nicoloso da Recco and the 16th Destroyer Squadron; in the subsequent months, he was the escort leader in numerous convoys carrying supplies from Italy and Greece towards North Africa, facing many attacks by British aircraft and submarines, with changing fortunes. His last escort mission resulted, on December 2, 1942, in the Battle of Skerki Bank: his convoy (composed of the transport ships Aventino, Aspromonte, Puccini and KT 1), escorted by three destroyers (Da Recco, Folgore and Camicia Nera) and two torpedo boats (Procione and Clio), was attacked during the night by the British Force Q, consisting of the light cruisers Aurora, Sirius and Argonaut and the destroyers Quiberon and Quentin. On Cocchia's orders, the entire escort launched a determined counterattack, but could not prevent the destruction of the convoy; Da Recco, after two unsuccessful attacks with guns and torpedoes, closed in on Force Q to launch a third attack, but the accidental ignition of fuel oil contained in the forward funnel originated a column of sparks, that gave away the position of the ship. Accurate British fire immediately crippled Da Recco, igniting her forward magazines; more than half of the crew was killed or wounded, including Cocchia, who suffered severe burns, especially on his face. Temporarily blinded, he had to give up the command to his executive officer; he was initially hospitalized at the hospital in Torrebianca (Trapani), and had to spend the next three years in a number of clinics, undergoing numerous surgery operations in an attempt to mitigate the damage caused by the fire. He was permanently disfigured; for his determined defense of the convoy against superior forces he was awarded Gold Medal of Military Valor. Due to his wounds, after the war he was transferred to the Role of Honour, where he reached the rank of Admiral; from November 1958, he was Director of the \\"Rivista Marittima\\" (the monthly magazine of the Italian Navy), and from July 1960 to June 1963 he was the head of the Italian Navy Historical Branch, directing the drafting of several volumes of its series on the activity of the Italian Navy in World War II. In his private life, he also authored several books about the war. He died in Naples on 12 December 1968.  Bibliography  * Aldo Cocchia, Convogli.

Buckingham was one of six candidates in the Republican primary to replace retiring state senator Troy Fraser. Buckingham portrayed herself as a political outsider and was endorsed by former governor Rick Perry. In the March 1, 2016, primary she received 25% of the vote, with state representative Susan King of Abilene receiving 27% of the vote. Because neither candidate received a majority, they advanced to a runoff election in May. After a contentious campaign focusing on the records and geographic profiles of the two candidates, Buckingham won the runoff with over 60% of the vote. In the November general election, Buckingham faced Democratic nominee Virginia ‚ÄúJennie Lou‚Äù Leeder of Llano. Buckingham won with over 70% of the vote.

Biography Mary was the daughter of Rory O'Donnell, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell and Bridget, daughter of Henry FitzGerald, 12th Earl of Kildare. She was born in England after her father's flight (see Flight of the Earls), and the royal name \\"Stuart\\" was given to her by King James I. Her mother Bridget returned to Ireland with Mary in 1609, where they lived on the FitzGerald estates in Kildare until 1619, after which they were summoned to live in England. She was granted a generous dowry by the king and was placed into the care of her grandmother, Lady Kildare. cites Mary lived in London for the next few years where Lady Kildare attempted to Anglicise the young girl and proposed to leave Mary her substantial inheritance and to provide a husband for her. Mary objected to the favoured suitor on the grounds that he was an Irishman who had converted to Protestantism; perhaps also because she had formed a previous attachment to Dualtach O'Gallagher. Much to the consternation of her mother's family, she increasingly associated with the young, disaffected Irish Catholics of London. In the summer of 1626, Mary and several friends broke into Gatehouse Prison and freed her half-brother Caffer \\"Con\\" O'Donnell and her first cousin, Hugh (Aedh) O'Rourke, who had recently been incarcerated for refusing to revoke their claims over planted land in Ireland.Irish Lives - Mary Stuart O'Donnell Following this incident her identity was compromised and she was ordered to appear before the royal court. She instead opted to flee London during the latter months of 1626. Dressed in male attire, and wearing a sword, she got clear of London, and after many wanderings arrived in Bristol. She was accompanied by a maid, Anne Baynham, similarly disguised, and by a young \\"gentilhomme son parent\\", who was most likely O'Gallagher. At Bristol her sex was suspected; but, according to a Spanish panegyrist, who likens her to various saints, she bribed a magistrate, offered to fight a duel, and made fierce love to another girl. Two attempts were made to reach Ireland, but the ship was beaten back into the Severn. At last Mary Stuart got off in a Dutch vessel, and was carried, with her two companions, to La Rochelle. She retained her doublet, boots, and sword, and at Poitiers made love to another lady. On her arrival at Brussels in January 1627, Pope Urban VIII wrote a special congratulatory letter; but she soon estranged her elder brother, Hugh, who she had never met before, by continuing to seek adventures in man's clothes and for refusing to marry yet another suitor, John O'Neill, 3rd Earl of Tyrone. Hugh had hoped to allay hostilities between the O'Donnell and O'Neill dynasties in preparation for a planned invasion of Ireland in 1627 by enlisting the help of Archbishop Florence Conry, who arranged for Mary to marry the Earl of Tyrone. Her secret relationship with O'Gallagher was exposed when she became pregnant in 1629 and they fled Brussels in disgrace. She and O'Gallagher arrived in Rome in 1630 where she was greeted with admiration as the daughter of the late Rory O'Donnell, and was provided a place to live and financial support by the Catholic Church. They married and she gave birth to a boy in Genoa, and in February 1632 wrote to Cardinal Barberini, saying that another child was expected. They later moved to Austria where O'Gallagher rose to the rank of Captain in the Imperial Army in 1635, but was killed that same year fighting in the Thirty Years' War. Her infant son fell ill and died shortly after her husband's passing. Beset by grief and estranged from her family, she travelled Europe once again before eventually settling down in Rome, where she married a poor Irish naval captain in 1639. Nothing more is known of her life after this.

The park is in the Araucarias Plateau, in the region of Campos de Cima da Serra, in the northeast of the state. It is from Porto Alegre, the state capital. The park is in the Brazilian Highlands, near the Uruguay River in the valley of the Marmeleiro stream. History The Espig√£o Alto Forest Reserve was created by state decree 658 of 10 March 1949. It was transformed into a state park by law 2.440 of 2 October 1954. Law 8.893 of 2 August 1989 allowed for the cultivation of exotic forest species that already existed in this and other state forest parks. The park was registered as being part of the state's natural and cultural heritage on 23 July 1994. Decree 42.000 of 9 December 2002 declared the land covered by the park as being of public utility for the purpose of expropriation as a step towards regularizing land ownership in the park.

The carol first appeared as a broadside in circa 1625, though its origins are unclear; Thomas Durfrey is sometimes erroneously identified as the lyricist. Though obscure, the carol has featured in numerous hymnals over the centuries. It is traditionally sung to the tune \\"When Phoebus did rest\\", under which it is printed in the Pepys and Roxburgh collections and Playford‚Äôs The English Dancing Master. The carol's lyrics discuss various seasonal festivities during Christmastide, which is directly mentioned in the verse \\"When Christmastide comes in like a bride‚Ä¶Twelve days in the year, much mirth and good cheer.\\" During the Elizabethan era (from which the song originates), the majority of Christmas celebrations occurred during the Twelve Days of Christmas. Traditional Elizabethan Christmas festivities alluded to in the carol include wassailing, feasting, and theatre performances. Lyrics :All hail to the days that merit more praise :Than all the rest of the year, :And welcome the nights that double delights, :As well for the poor as the peer! :Good fortune attend each merry man's friend, :That doth but the best that he may; :Forgetting old wrongs, with carols and songs, :To drive the cold winter away. :This time of the year is spent in good cheer, :And neighbours together do meet, :To sit by the fire, with friendly desire, :Each other in love do greet; :Old grudges forgot, are put in the pot, :All sorrows aside they lay, :The old and the young doth carol his song, :To drive the cold winter away. :To mask and to mum kind neighbours will come :With wassails of nut-brown ale, :To drink and carouse to all in the house, :As merry as bucks in the dale; :Where cake, bread and cheese is brought for your fees, :To make you the longer stay; :At the fire to warm will do you no harm, :To drive the cold winter away. :When Christmastide comes in like a bride, :With holly and ivy clad, :Twelve days in the year, much mirth and good cheer, :In every household is had; :The country guise is then to devise :Some gambols of Christmas play, :Whereat the young men do best that they can, :To drive the cold winter away. :When white-bearded frost hath threatened his worst, :And fallen from branch and brier, :Then time away calls, from husbandry halls :And from the good countryman's fire, :Together to go to plough and to sow, :To get us both food and array; :And thus with content the time we have spent :To drive the cold winter away. Notable recordings Canadian folk artist Loreena McKennitt recorded the carol, titled \\"In Praise of Christmas\\", for her Christmas album To Drive the Cold Winter Away (1987). English folksinger Kate Rusby recorded the song under the title \\"Cold Winter\\" for her album The Frost Is All Over (2015). Rusby‚Äôs version included four of the traditional verses, which were sung to a tune that she composed.The Frost is All Over (CD). pp. (Inside cover, CD booklet).

She rose to public attention in 1855 when her lover, Charles Cora, killed US Marshall William H. Richardson after they had a conflict at the theater. She died in 1862.  Early life Two portrayals of Belle Cora's childhood exist. The first lists her as the daughter of a minister in Baltimore who becomes pregnant as a teen. When her father finds out, he throws Cora out of the house, prompting her to move to New Orleans, where the baby dies and she meets Charles Cora. The alternate, and more prominently upheld, version depicts Belle to be the daughter of Irish Catholic parents in Baltimore. In this version, she and her sister work at a dress shop next to a brothel. Intrigued by the house, they become involved with the sex trade. At some point, Cora ventured to Charleston, South Carolina and, during her time there, she became the mistress of a man who was later killed. The death prompted her to move to New Orleans and, there, in 1849, she met Charles Cora. Career In December 1849, the couple moved to Sacramento, California and, while there, Belle helped fund Charles's high-stakes gambling. After some time, the couple moved to Marysville, California, and Belle opened her first brothel, called the New World. gambling parlor and offered games like poker, roulette, faro, and dice. At 23, they moved yet again and she opened a brothel in Sonora, California. Photograph of the Cora House in 1853 In 1852, Belle set up a parlor house on Washington street, in San Francisco, opposite the house of fellow madam, Ah Toy. Reverend William Taylor recounts the parlor house as being furnished with redwood, velvet, silk, demask, beautiful paintings and playing pianoforte, harp and melodeon. Belle hosted dinner parties with aldermen, judges, the mayor, and even members of the legislature. Even after an expensive legal battle and the lynching of her husband, Belle continued to run her brothel. Murder of US Marshall Richardson and the aftermath Belle Cora held a competing party (which had more guests) the same night as the wife of US Marshall William H. Richardson, which is said to have begun a rivalry between the women. The feud was further provoked one evening at the American Theatre. Richardson's wife complained to the manager that the Coras were seated in the same balcony as she was, as she felt that area should be reserved for more respectable guests. However, the manager refused to remove the couple, saying that they were regular customers of the first balcony. William left swearing vengeance upon Charles. On November 17, 1855, between 6 and 7 o'clock, Charles Cora shot Marshall Richardson in the breast in front of Fox and O'Connor's store on Clay street between Leidesdorff and Montgomery Street. He died instantaneously from the wound. Charles Cora was arrested, handed over to the city marshall, and later placed in the county jail. Protests and lynch mobs erupted after the murder so Mayor James Van Ness placed Charles under a higher security accommodation for his own safety. Local citizens raised fund for a monument for Richardson in the Lone Mountain Cemetery and $15,000 for his children. Belle funded several attorneys to represent Charles Cora including Edward Dickinson Baker and James A. McDougall. Belle paid Edward Dickinson Baker $15,000 of his $30,000 retainer in gold and sent meals to Charles Cora while he was in jail. In addition, she even went so far as trying to bribe the star witness Maria Knight to change her testimony. Alleging that Richardson had threatened Charles with a knife, the lawyers framed the case as one of self-defense. On 1856 January 17, Charles's trial ended with hung jury. On May 15, 1856, the 2nd Committee of Vigilance was formed, and by May 17, the committee had gained 2500 members. The collected guns and began to conduct \\"army\\" drills. The following day, 3,000 armed members of the committee took Charles and James P. Casey. On 1856 May 18, in Sacramento, Governor Johnson, in response,CALIFORNIA IN TIME: The Fight over Slavery through the Civil War parks.ca.gov appointed William Tecumseh Sherman as the Major-General commanding of the San Francisco division of the California State Militia. The related case of James Casey (who had shot newspaper editor James King of William in an assassination attempt) prompted the committee to aim a cannon at the jail and demand the release of Charles and Casey. The Hanging of Charles Cora The 2nd Committee of Vigilance scheduled a new trial for 1856 May 20; James King of William died the same day. Samuel Brannan delivered a speech on justice and the enforcement of the law before the trial. Both men were found guilty, and on 1856 May 22, the committee The committee sentence both of them to hang the following day at noon. Before the execution, Belle and Charles got married by Father Michael Acoltti. For fear of escape, 3,000 men and two field pieces led Charles to his execution, at the committee's headquarters at 41 Sacramento Street in front of a crowd of 20,000. Charles said nothing as the noose was placed around his head. The cord was cut at twenty minutes past one o'clock, leaving Charles to drop six feet and hang for fifty five minutes before being turned over to the coroner.  Death and legacy  Belle Cora died at 35, in 1862, of pneumonia. She was buried in the Calvary Cemetery next to her husband. In 1916, the San Francisco Bulletin published a serial on Cora by Pauline Jacobson and, as a result, Belle was disinterred and reburied with Charles beneath a common headstone at the Mission Dolores Cemetery. Karen Joy Fowler's alludes to Cora's influence on social norms in novel Sister Noon. During a societal shift toward \\"civilizing\\" society, Belle had maintained her business, which had been seen as immoral. In the book Arresting Dress, the author Clare Sears opines that Cora inspires female financial agency and the use of sex for empowerment. In addition, Cora advocated against gender stereotypes, as demonstrated by her legal battle with the Vigilance Committee; ultimately she set the precedent to resist further legislation like that of sodomy laws in the 20th century.

Issues The amendment proposed equal rights for women, and was first introduced to Congress in 1923, finally gaining Congressional approval in 1972. Once Congress had approved the amendment, ratification by the states was requested and the typical 7-year time limit for ratification by two-thirds of the states was set in motion. The march was held to convince legislators that the period allowed for ratification should be extended beyond the deadline, which would occur on 29 March 1979. Protesters were successful in getting the House to approve an extension to 1982 in August, 1978 and the Senate to grant approval of the same timeframe by a vote of 60 to 36 in October 1978.

Club career Azim was a participant of the footballing scheme run by Brunei Darussalam Schools' Sports Council (MSSSBD) under the Ministry of Education, whilst attending Sayyidina Hasan Secondary School. He was soon scouted by Brunei's football association NFABD and placed him in the Tabuan Under-18 team in the 2015 Brunei Premier League. Azim attended a tryout for DPMM FC's Under-19 team in early 2015 and was selected by Steve Kean as the team's captain. He progressed well through the ranks and was awarded with a promotion to the first team at the start of the 2016 S.League season, alongside Abdul Hafiz Abdul Rahim and Na'im Tarif. He made his competitive debut in a 3‚Äì0 loss to Ceres-La Salle in the quarterfinals of the 2016 Singapore Cup on 30 June 2016. On 21 July, Azim came on as a second-half substitute against Tampines Rovers and later capitalized on a mistake from Joey Sim to score the winner of the match, enabling DPMM to qualify as group winners in the 2016 Singapore League Cup group stage. His team went all the way to the final later that month, but Azim could only watch from the bench as DPMM lose to Albirex Niigata (S) in a 0‚Äì2 scoreline. Azim finally made his S.League debut on 11 August in a 1‚Äì1 stalemate against Geylang International, coming on as an 82nd-minute substitute. Azim played for the academy side of his club that competed in the 2018-19 Brunei Premier League in early 2019. He appeared in all seven matches and was the captain for the final game of the season when they were crowned champions of the league. However he was barely in Adrian Pennock's plans in the first team, and was let go after the 2019 season ended, making only a single substitute appearance in two years. Azim joined Kota Ranger FC for the 2020 Brunei Super League season, winning the Piala Sumbangsih in his first appearance on 8 February against MS ABDB. International career Azim was selected for the 2018 AFC U-23 Championship qualification matches held in Myanmar in July 2017, his first involvement with the national team at any level. He made his debut in the first group game against Australia as a second-half substitute in a 2-0 loss. He started the third and final game against Singapore and scored a consolation for the Young Wasps in the 1‚Äì4 defeat. One year later, Azim was selected for the 2018 Hassanal Bolkiah Trophy with the under-21s. He started the opening match on 23 April, which was a 0-1 loss against Timor-Leste. He was relegated to the substitutes' bench in their second game against Thailand, but came on later in the match and took the corner that club teammate Yura Yunos scored the winner from. Azim was once again chosen to play for the under-23s at the 2020 AFC U-23 Championship qualification round held in Vietnam in late March 2019. He was a second-half substitute in the second game against Thailand where Brunei were comprehensibly beaten 0‚Äì8. He also came on late for an injured Martin Haddy Khallidden in the final game against Indonesia and scored a retaken penalty in the 85th minute after the dismissal of goalkeeper Muhammad Riyandi for a second bookable offence. (The initial penalty by Nur Asyraffahmi Norsamri was saved by Riyandi but he was booked for stepping off his line before the kick was taken. With Garuda Muda having used all three substitutes, stand-in keeper Dimas Drajad was unable to stop Azim's spotkick, but later saved another penalty in injury time. The game ended 2‚Äì1 to Indonesia.)

Rhind was awarded an MBE in the 1998 New Year Honours for services to the preservation of the historical character of Blackheath. He was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in June 2005 and, in January 2011, appointed an Honorary Fellow of the University of London, Goldsmith's College for his work in the conservation and historic research of south east London. Early life Rhind was born and has lived most of his life in Blackheath, London. He is the youngest of four siblings born to Doris Pamela and William Alexander, a naval officer. During World War II, Rhind was evacuated and separated from his siblings for a time. He returned to Blackheath in 1951. Rhind was educated at St Marylebone Grammar School. He married Elizabeth on 3 September 1960, has two children, and lives in The Lane in Blackheath's Cator Estate. Journalism career From 1957 to 1959, Rhind served in RAF air traffic control, mainly at Uxbridge. He worked briefly as a librarian before joining the Odham Newnes Press where he worked as the Packaging Review Yearbook editor. From 1963 he was assistant editor and then managing editor of the Good Food Guide. In 1967 he became a freelance writer working as a press officer for the Consumers' Association and press officer of the Greenwich Theatre, during and following its rebuilding and reopening. In 1969 he became press officer of the Blackheath Society. From 1969, prompted by fierce local opposition to the Greater London Development Plan (London Ringways) and its adverse effect on Blackheath, Rhind became involved in documenting and protecting the social and architectural history of his home district, Blackheath and Greenwich. Work on Blackheath In 1971 Rhind joined the Greenwich and Lewisham Antiquarian Society (renamed the Greenwich Historical Society in 1991) and was elected to its council in 1973. He succeeded Sir Leslie Monson as president in 1982, in turn being succeeded by Sir Robert Somerville in 1984. He gave two presidential addresses - The Cator Estate and Blackheath: Some Sporting Myths, and Thoughts on Jack the Ripper, the Blackheath Connection  and remains a vice-president. Rhind joined the Blackheath Society committee in 1974, succeeded Ken Bound as chairman in September 1993, resigning in May 1998. Since then he has collated an archive collection of over 15,000 images of Blackheath which are being digitised and made available online. In 2016 he was appointed president of the Society. He is a long-standing member of the Lewisham Local History Council (an advisory group set up by Lewisham Council), and a member of the Greenwich Industrial History Society and Lewisham Local History Society. He was chairman of the Blackheath Schools of Art and Music Trust and founder of the Friends of Ranger's House. He is an honorary life member of the Westcombe Society and a past chairman of the London Borough of Lewisham Conservation Advisory Committee. He was a leading contributor to the Blackheath Conservation Area AppraisalBlackheath Conservation Area Appraisal submitted to Lewisham Council in 2007. Blackheath Preservation Trust Rhind was director and secretary of the Blackheath Preservation Trust from October 1972 to May 2001. The Trust was set up in 1938 to combat the demolition and destruction of buildings of architectural and historic merit. As secretary, Rhind was involved in work relating to the Blackheath Art Club, Blackheath railway station/Chapman House, Brigade House, Brooklands House, The Cedars, Eagle House in Lewisham, Martin House, Park Hall, Poplar Cottage, Vanbrugh Castle, the Westcombe Woodlands, and Blackheath Halls (in 1977, the BPT bought the property, then threatened with demolition by developers; the BPT retained the freehold until it was acquired by Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance). His interest in the preservation trust movement led to a time as an advisor to the Vivat Trust. 2012 Olympics Rhind was a supporter of NOGOE (No to Greenwich Olympic Equestrian Events) which organised ultimately unsuccessful opposition to the use of an area of Blackheath just outside the Greenwich Park gates, known as Circus Field, for Olympic equestrian events. Campaigners claimed that it would be unlawful for the London Borough of Greenwich to give planning permission for London 2012 to use the land because the enclosure of any part of the Heath, including Circus Field, would be contrary to the Metropolitan Commons Act 1866, which established the concept of metropolitan commons being available at all times for the benefit of members of the public. A NOGOE petition had gathered over 12,000 signatures, but the argument was rejected by Greenwich. Writing Rhind has written several books, starting in 1968 with The Consumer Wakes Up, and Make Me Understand Pregnancy and Childbirth and The Greenwich Theatre Book in 1969. Since then his output has mainly focused on subjects related to Blackheath, including two volumes on Blackheath Village and Environs. Drawing on his research and writing, Rhind has led numerous walks in the Blackheath area describing buildings of architectural or historical interest, and given many talks on local history.

History The municipality of H√¶geland was established on 1 July 1896 when the old municipality of √òvreb√∏ og H√¶geland was divided into the separate municipalities of H√¶geland (population: 843) and √òvreb√∏ (population: 888). During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the municipality of H√¶geland (population: 849) was dissolved and merged with the neighboring municipalities of Vennesla (population: 7,321), and most of √òvreb√∏ (population: 925) to form a new Vennesla municipality. (Vennesla was previously part of the old municipality of √òvreb√∏ og H√¶geland until 1865). Name The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old H√¶geland farm (Old Norse: Helgaland) since that is where the H√¶geland Church was located. The first element of the name means \\"holy\\" (Old Norse: heilagr and ) and the last element (Old Norse: land) is identical with the word land which means \\"land\\".

It officially opened in 1933 but is rumored to have operated as a gay speakeasy since before the end of Prohibition. It is said to be the oldest continuously operating gay bar in the United States, along with Cafe Lafitte in New Orleans, Louisiana which has also operated since 1933. The White Horse is situated geographically near the Oakland-Berkeley border and in close proximity to the University of California, Berkeley campus.  History  Naval Supply Depot in Oakland was built in 1941. The White Horse Inn likely served as a place of gathering for gay and lesbian members of the military stationed in Oakland. Early history of the White Horse Inn is unclear; it officially states that it opened in 1933 following the passage of the 21st Amendment,, although it is rumored to have operated as a speakeasy during the Prohibition period. Records show that local businessman Abraham C. Karski, founder of the Grand Lake Theater, ordered the construction of the building and founded the bar. At its opening in the 1930s, the White Horse was not explicitly a gay bar but rather a \\"gay-friendly bar [with a] no-touching policy\\" and Chinese restaurant. Advertisements from the 1940s state that the restaurant offered \\"exotic Chinese dinners and distinctive American cuisine.\\" It was likely frequented by factory and port workers from nearby industrial centers as well as soldiers and sailors, especially during the Great Depression and World War II. The bar's small distance to the local university meant many students visited the bar; a patron who began attending the White Horse Inn in 1948 says the bar had a \\"reputation for being Cal's gay life.\\" Police raids began targeting gay and lesbian bars in the San Francisco Bay Area intensely from the 1950s onward. A variety of laws including \\"public morals\\" and sexual perversion ordinances were used to harass bars and their patrons. This occurred in the midst of post-war politics and anti-gay attitudes which \\"associated gay men with poor morals and weak wills,\\" placing homosexual perspectives in opposition to national policies. In 1961 and 1962, police shut down nearly half of all gay bars in San Francisco, and raids continued into the 1970s. San Francisco police often arrested men leaving bars, demanded \\"extortion payments\\" from bars, and forcefully revoked liquor licenses. However, unlike other bars in the region, the White Horse Inn was never raided by police. The White Horse Inn thus served as a sanctuary for gays and lesbians in the area. Protestors against the Vietnam War marched from the University of California, Berkeley to downtown Oakland during Stop the Draft Week, October 1967. Demonstrations like this dominated the climate of Oakland in the middle of the 20th-century. Oakland and Berkeley became a prominent site for activism by the 1960s and 1970s. For example, the Free Speech Movement led marches down Telegraph Avenue and the Berkeley chapter of the Gay Liberation Front were founded during this time. Though the White Horse Inn was \\"never a hotbed of political action,\\" \\"protesters and hippies\\" frequently met here. One patron noted many visitors had \\"long hair [and] attitude,\\" and held views against the Vietnam War. In September 1970, the bar witnessed a sit-in protest and boycott because the bar refused to distribute Gay Sunshine, a gay liberation-oriented newspaper, and prohibited gay couples from showing physical affection. Berkeley GLF founder Nicholas F. Benton instead hosted \\"People's Alternative\\" dance parties as a response to what radical activists saw as the \\"cynical and apolitical\\" atmosphere of the White Horse Inn.Hobson, Emily (2016). Lavender and Red: Liberation and Solidarity in the Gay and Lesbian Left. Oakland, California: University of California Press. pp. 29‚Äì30. . Radical activists saw bars like the White Horse as \\"symbols of oppression, rather than as safe harbors.\\" Resolution to the September protests came when the bar met some of the protestors' concessions including permitting slow dancing, reversing bans on over one hundred GLF members, and allowing distribution of Gay Sunshine. In August 2018, the crosswalks outside the White Horse were painted rainbow by an unofficial group to support LGBTQ+ rights.https://sf.streetsblog.org/2018/08/29/eyes-on-the-street-law-breakers- paint-rainbow-crosswalks-on-telegraph/  Culture and Legacy  The White Horse Inn is widely renowned as one of most notable and significant gay bars in the country. A variety of publications ‚Äì especially gay and lesbian directories and journals ‚Äì include and celebrate the White Horse in their listings. Betty and Pansy's Severe Queer Review of San Francisco, a comprehensive collection of Bay Area queer knowledge, says that the White Horse should be part of the \\"basic queer East Bay survival kit.\\" In 2014, the National Park Service announced its initiative to study and commemorate LGBT history. The White Horse Inn is listed among the list of places of historic significance to be studied. The bar features a jukebox and karaoke, pool tables and pinball machines, and a dance floor with a disco-ball, among other things. It is often noted as being tamer in comparison to other Bay Area bars. News articles often state that \\"its never been particularly raunchy\\" nor is it \\"heavy on the cruising.\\" Local drag king Tommy Salami, who performs at the bar, describes the White Horse as a \\"sort of a time-capsule divey gay bar\\" and \\"old-school gay.\\" In the 2000s and 2010s, the bar has hosted wet T-shirt and underwear contests, \\"beer busts,\\" and drag king shows hosted by Tommy Salami. Descriptions of its clientele differ. One sociologist in 1975 stated that the bar was \\"diverse,\\" receiving patronage from its similarly diverse surrounding populations while a publication in 1983 described it as \\"a mixed crowd\\" in terms of gender but \\"primarily white.\\" In the 1970s, the White Horse Inn was home to a Women's Night with a \\"healthy tradition of cruising and flirting.\\" Its proximity to a now-defunct lesbian feminist bookstore, Mama Bears, made it a popular locale for lesbian women. The White Horse Inn has been a place of gathering for the gay and lesbian community, for example, during protests against the passage of Proposition 8 in California which outlawed gay marriage in 2008. In 2013, the bar joined boycotts against Russian vodka in response to a Russian \\"anti-gay propaganda law.\\" In October 2014, the White Horse Inn was used as a setting for the HBO show \\"Looking.\\" On June 16, 2016, shortly after the Orlando nightclub shooting, podcast The Memory Palace released the episode \\"A White Horse\\" narrating the history of the White Horse Inn and stressing the continuity and community it represented within the LGBTQ community. The episode is rebroadcast every year on or near the anniversary of the shooting.

Built in 1892 and enlarged in 1916, it served as the city's second high school until 1932, when the present Lynn English High School building on Goodridge Street was built. This building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its architecture in 1986. A total of five Holman K. Wheeler structures in Lynn are listed on the National Register. After serving for many years as a junior high school, it was converted into residential units. Description and history The former English High School building stands near downtown Lynn, at the western corner of Liberty and Essex Streets. It is located across Liberty Street from the Old Lynn High School, the city's first high school built in 1850-51. This building consists of two parts, both built of brick. Nearest the Liberty & Essex street corner is a T-shaped three-story section which exhibits Jacobethan styling, built in 1924 to a design by George A. Cornet after a fire on March 29, 1924 destroyed the original 1892 portion. It has a central entrance pavilion with a Tudor arched entry, and slightly projecting end wings, all adorned with parapets at the roof. The leg of the T projects to the rear of this section, and is joined to the four-story second section. It has more Gothic and Romanesque styling, with buttresses between panels of windows, and a corbelled brick cornice. The oldest portion of this building was the Romanesque portion, which was built in 1892 to a design by Wheeler & Northend. A 1916 addition of similar style facing James street was designed by Wheeler & Johnson. The current main section is a 1924 replacement after a fire destroyed the 1892 section. This school was built to replace the building across Liberty Street, and served the city as a high school until 1932, when the present English High School was built. It then served for many years as a junior high school. When surveyed in 1985, it was vacant. It has since been converted into residences.

Cooliekkara Kuppam, a slum area in Chennai. He is one such responsible youth who focuses on working for the betterment of his fellow beings, and he works hard for the same. Arivu starts Kuppam FM 90.8, a local radio channel with the help of the area gangster, Kasi. In reality, Arivu tries to free the people of the area from the atrocities of Kasi, who is deliberately preventing them from becoming independent, so that he may continue to dominate the area. Arivu succeeds in turning the people of the area against Kasi, thus destroying his support. Later, Arivu joins a leading FMCG company called Saffron and joins its sales department under Stella Bruce. He manages to bring his friend Bhagya out of Kasi's gang and gets him a job in Saffron. He meets Aadhi, Saffron's brand manager, who teaches him how to progress by doing smart work, and Arivu considers him as his inspiration. On the night of April 1, Kasi and his gang attack and stab Bhagya in Saffron's warehouse, whereupon he dies in Arivu's hands. Arivu, filled with rage, tries to attack Kasi, but Kasi's rival Doss attacks and stabs Kasi in retaliation for their previous encounter. Arivu admonishes Kasi for being a paid henchman. Kasi reveals to Arivu that he killed Bhagya on a contract given by Jayaram, the President of Saffron. The motive was that Bhagya tried to help Kasthuri, who filed a case claiming Saffron's products to be adulterated, due to which she lost her son. Arivu is addressed by Kasi as being a worse hitman than he himself is. Arivu then saves Kasi, who tells Arivu that all products manufactured by Saffron are adulterated. Arivu takes up a mission to fight such malpractices not only in Saffron, but in all the other five major food companies, including the one owned by Madhav Kurup. Arivu shares all of his plans with Aadhi. Meanwhile, is revealed that Aadhi is actually Adhiban Madhav, Madhav's son. He joined Saffron to know their trade secrets and merge the company with his father's company. Arivu manages to convince his company's staff to manufacture products as per government regulations for two days. At the same time, he convinces the staff of the other companies to wear a kerchief on their dresses for the next two days, thus tricking the owners into believing that their workers have turned against them. However, Aadhi manages to foil Arivu's plan and coerces the other owners to write over the major shares of their company to Madhav, thus making him the deciding authority of all their companies. Aadhi manages to turn the employees against Arivu by tricking them into believing that Arivu worked as a spy for Madhav. Stella Bruce then slaps and humiliates Arivu, while Aadhi pretends to defend Arivu, claiming that he is innocent and that it is the new president who conspired all these. After this, Arivu reveals to Aadhi that Stella Bruce was his ally, and he now knows that Aadhi is the true traitor. Aadhi then burns down the godown containing the unadulterated products and reveals to Arivu that he is Madhav's son and will be the next CEO of the company. He also convinces the staff through his clever tactics and makes them propose his name as the new CEO, also revealing to Arivu that he will make them manufacture adulterated products without their knowledge, now that he commands their loyalty, support, and trust. Arivu goes to the Radio Mirchi radio station on the night before May 1. He reveals that after the fire, one of the injured department heads of Saffron, Karpaga Vinayagam, called him into the ambulance and told him that he followed the regulations on the third day too. Arivu learned from the other Saffron team workers - Kennedy, Vinoth, Ansari, and Sivaranjani - that after manufacturing quality products for two days, they could not bring themselves to manufacture adulterated products on the next day. They confirm they all followed government regulations, thus manufacturing quality products on the next day. Aadhi, now the CEO, hears the workers say that they will rebel against him and depose him if he tries to revert to manufacturing adulterated products. Arivu adds that the loyalty of all the employees in every field should not be wasted by showing it towards unethical employers. Aadhi then vents his frustration about the failure of his plan. All the people in the city show their support to Arivu, who celebrates his success with his love interest Mrinalini, friends, family, the people of his slum, and the people of the city as the film ends.

Plot Cold Open Prior to the events of the episode, Pops is upset about the upcoming fight and is put in a very bad mood. The gang at the park cheer him up by throwing him a party. In order to remember the events, all of their memories are put onto a collection of Blu- rays and buried in the park. They set a course to the location of the fight, Lolliland, Pops' home planet. Part 1 The park crew arrives at Lolliland, the birthplace of Pops and Anti-Pops. They meet a group of Lolliland natives: Frivola-Kranus, Quadravi-Kranus and Weird Mushroom Guy. The natives explain Pops and Anti-Pops are really named Mega-Kranus and Malum-Kranus, respectively. The natives show the park crew ancient tapestries of the previous battles between Pops and Anti-Pops, which detail prior incarnations of the park crew fighting alongside Pops. Knowing that all of the prior battles have ended in a stalemate (resulting in the universe resetting), Mordecai comes up with the plan of setting traps for Anti-Pops to give Pops an upper hand which he didn't have in previous battles. After Anti-Pops arrives in an Uber-like taxi, Pops tries to convince him not to fight due to them being brothers. Anti-Pops refuses, and attacks Pops, but is caught in the traps laid by the park crew. The victory is short-lived however, as Anti-Pops easily escapes the traps. Part 2 To ensure the survival of his friends, Pops makes a deal with Anti-Pops: whoever lands the first blow in battle gets to decide the fate of the universe. Pops successfully injures Anti-Pops, but Anti-Pops breaks the deal and continues the fight. Meanwhile, the park crew, HD DVD, Blu-ray, the Baby Ducks, Toothpick Sally, Recap Robot, Chance Sureshot (whose prior \\"death\\" is revealed to be that of a clone), the Guardians of Eternal Youth, Gary, Carter and Briggs, Party Horse 42699, and the Guardian of Lolliland fight against Anti-Pops's minions and Streaming Modem and defeat them. However, Anti-Pops unlocks his full power and begins erasing Lolliland. The erasing of all of Pops's allies and friends (with the exception of Mordecai and Rigby) causes him to unlock his own full power. Mordecai and Rigby watch in awe as the two brothers' punches collide, obliterating the entire universe and resetting time. Part 3: \\"The Power\\" Part 3 begins exactly like the first episode of Season 1, \\"The Power\\", seemingly \\"resetting\\" time back to the beginning of the series. However, Rigby quickly remembers the events of the prior episodes and the rest of the series. Rigby shows Mordecai the stash of buried Blu-rays, which triggers his memories of the series' events after touching it. Realizing that time didn't properly reset, they use the Power to take them to the future, and back to the battle between Pops and Anti-Pops. Anti-Pops attacks them, destroying the Power in the process. As Pops continues to fight, it becomes clear that fighting Anti-Pops will inevitably lead to another stalemate. Pops grabs Anti-Pops and flies toward the sun, telepathically comforting Mordecai and Rigby. Anti-Pops reconciles with his brother, and the two finally at peace before they fly into the sun. With the resetting cycle broke, the erased park gang (and allies) are revived. After three years in space, the park's dome is flown back to Earth, where they reunite with friends and family and are welcomed as heroes. The park workers and Mr. Maellard erect a memorial statue in honor of Pops and mourn him. After six years of working at the park, Mordecai and Rigby quit their jobs and move on with their lives. Mordecai becomes a successful artist, marries a bat named Stef, and has three children with her. Rigby marries Eileen and has three children as well. Muscle Man and Starla move into a trailer in the park and has many children, who adopt many of his mannerisms (like taking off their shirts and yelling). High-Five Ghost and his girlfriend, Celia, become party DJs touring in Prague and later have a son. Benson, who now becomes the owner of the park after Mr. Maellard passes on, reunites with Pam and the two adopt four cats along with Applesauce, Benson's pig. Skips continues happily working in the park, but ditches his trademark jeans for jean shorts. At their 25th anniversary reunion, the park crew raises a statue of Mr. Maellard next to the one of Pops and take a picture in front of it with their families. As the reunion party commences, a now middle aged Mordecai and Rigby reminisce on the sacrifice of Pops and how none of them would have been able to lead such wonderful lives without him. They decide to play some old arcade games before laughing at how immature they used to be. This episode ends with the revelation that Pops is watching his friends in what seems to be an afterlife on a VHS tape labeled \\"Regular Show\\". He ejects the tape and says \\"Jolly good show\\" as the series officially ends set to the 1977 David Bowie song \\"Heroes\\".

On 1 July 1896 the municipality of √òvreb√∏ was re-created when the municipality of √òvreb√∏ og H√¶geland was divided into two separate municipalities: √òvreb√∏ (population: 888) and H√¶geland (population: 843).

Clayton was the original voice of Miss Chiquita, the Chiquita banana singer. In 1944, bananas were an exotic fruit in America. The Chiquita banana jingle was introduced, not only to promote bananas, but to teach the public how to use and store them. With music and lyrics provided by admen Garth Montgomery, Leonard Mackenzie, and William Wirges, Clayton sang \\"I'm Chiquita Banana and I've come to say, bananas have to ripen in a certain way... bananas like the climate of the very very tropical equator, so you should never put bananas in the refrigerator\\". This was one of the most successful commercial jingles of all time, and was played up to 376 times a day on radio stations across the United States.

At times the conflict had the character of a civil war between two peasant factions: the m√ºllerisch, named for the early leadership of the miller (m√ºller) Joseph Tr√∂ndle, and the salpterisch, so named because one of its early leaders, Hans Albiez, made his money in the saltpeter trade. Background The county of Hauenstein, roughly coterminous with the Hotzenwald, lay along the north bank of the Rhine, across from Switzerland in the south of a collection of territories known as Further Austria, since they were ruled by the archduke of Austrian. The archduke, a member of the Habsburg dynasty, was usually also the Holy Roman Emperor and thus both immediate overlord and ultimate sovereign of Hauenstein. The county had about 16,000 inhabitants in 1725, two thirds of whom were serfs of the abbey. Although the fees and services they owed to the abbey were, by the early eighteenth century, \\"virtually inconsequential\\", the majority of serfs regarded their servile status as \\"an intolerable abomination\\". The primary aim of the serfs in the simmering conflict that preceded the outbreak of warfare in 1725 and lasted into the nineteenth century was to obtain their freedom. The abbey of Saint Blaise began acquiring extensive properties in Hauenstein in the mid-thirteenth century. It eventually acquired the County of Bonndorf, which possessed Landeshoheit (territorial supremacy) because it was immediately subject to the emperor. In order to defend their interests against the acquisitiveness of the abbey‚Äîand in a process similar to that which transpired in Switzerland to the south‚Äîthe peasants of Hauenstein organised themselves into eight cantons (Einungen, \\"unions\\"). In 1370, 1412, 1525 and 1612 the differences of opinion between the peasants and the abbey erupted into open violence. By 1725, each of the cantons was represented by a magistrate elected annually by the adult men. Collectively, they were known as the Eight or the Octovirs, in German the Einungsmeister. They function as intermediaries between the cantons and the Austrian state and the abbey, and were also the leaders of the m√ºllerisch faction. Austria appointed a forest steward, who in turn appointed bailiffs in each of the cantons. The bailiffs were chosen from among the nominees of the peasants. Outbreak of war in 1725 There were four main points of contention between the Einungsmeister, representing the Hauensteiner peasants, and the abbey of Saint Blaise; all were of long standing: (1) the monetarized value of certain services owed the abbey, (2) the abbey's claims on its serfs' inheritances, (3) the severity of the fines imposed by the lower court and (4) the abbey's claim of \\"sovereignty\\" or Landeshoheit over its serfs. The dispute of 1725 arose over the abbey's demand for an oath of homage from the peasants, and this was transformed into a full-scale peasant revolt by the abbey's attempt to take a census.

Influenced by American and British rock of the 1960s, the first rock bands in Japan performed what is called Group Sounds, with lyrics almost exclusively in English. Folk rock band Happy End in the early 1970s are credited as the first to sing rock music in the Japanese language. Punk rock bands Bo√∏wy and The Blue Hearts and hard rock/heavy metal groups X Japan and B'z led Japanese rock in the late 1980s and early 1990s by achieving major mainstream success. Japanese rock music has received recognition worldwide, being widely known in Asia, and has survived through decades competing with its contemporary local style J-pop. Rock bands such as B'z and Mr. Children are among the best selling music acts in Japan. The demand for rock in Japan is so huge that festivals mainly focused on it like the Fuji Rock Festival have been introduced since the late 90s with attendances reaching a peak of 200,000 people per festival making it the largest outdoor music event in the country. History 1960s: Western music adaptation The Spiders in the Netherlands, 1966 In the 1960s, many Japanese rock bands were influenced by Western rock musicians such as the Beatles, Bob Dylan, and the Rolling Stones, along with other Appalachian folk music, psychedelic rock, mod and similar genres: a phenomenon that was called Group Sounds (G.S.). John Lennon of the Beatles later became one of the most popular Western musicians in Japan. Group Sounds is a style of Japanese rock music that was popular in the mid to late 1960s. After the boom of Group Sounds, there were several influential singer-songwriters. Nobuyasu Okabayashi was the first who became widely recognized. , inspired by Woody Guthrie, also became popular.. They both were influenced by American folk music but wrote Japanese lyrics. Takada used modern Japanese poetry as lyrics, while Kazuki Tomokawa made an album using Chuya Nakahara's poems. , inspired by Bob Dylan, wrote critically acclaimed lyrics. The Tigers were the most popular Group Sounds band in the era. Later, some of the members of the Tigers, the Tempters, and the Spiders formed the first Japanese supergroup, Pyg. After seeing a show by then-upcoming artist Jimi Hendrix during a visit to Europe, Yuya Uchida returned home and formed Yuya Uchida & the Flowers in November 1967 in order to introduce a similar sound to Japan. They released the album Challenge! in July 1969, featuring covers of American and British psychedelic rock acts such as Big Brother and the Holding Company and Cream. 1970s to 1980s: Diversification =Hard rock and heavy metal= Loudness performing in Hamburg, 2010. Uchida replaced every member of The Flowers except its drummer and renamed them the Flower Travellin' Band for October 1970's Anywhere, which includes covers of heavy metal band Black Sabbath and progressive rock act King Crimson. They moved to Canada and published their first album of original material, Satori which was released in April 1971 and is now considered a progenitor of heavy metal music and, together with Kirikyogen, doom metal. Japanese heavy metal bands started emerging in the late 1970s, pioneered by Bow Wow (1975), 44 Magnum (1977) and Earthshaker (1978). In 1977, Bow Wow supported Aerosmith and Kiss on their Japanese tours. They performed at both the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland and the Reading Festival in England in 1982. After some member changes resulted in a more commercial sound, they changed their name to Vow Wow and relocated to England. Their 1989 album Helter Skelter reached number 75 on the UK Albums Chart. In the 1980s, a plethora of Japanese heavy metal bands formed. Loudness was formed in 1981 by former Lazy members Akira Takasaki and Munetaka Higuchi. In 1983, they toured the United States and Europe and soon started focusing more on an international career. In a 1985 deal with Atco Records, Loudness became the first Japanese metal act signed to a major label in the United States. Their albums Thunder in the East (1985), Lightning Strikes (1986) and Hurricane Eyes (1987) reached numbers 74, 64 and 190 on the Billboard chart. Loudness replaced singer Minoru Niihara with American vocalist Michael Vescera in 1988, in an unsuccessful attempt to further their international popularity. Till the end of the eighties only two other bands, Ezo and Dead End, got their albums released in the United States. In the eighties few bands had a female members, like all-female band Show-Ya fronted by Keiko Terada, and Terra Rosa with Kazue Akao on vocals. In September 1989, Show-Ya's album Outerlimits was released, it reached number 3 in the Oricon album chart. =Folk= Homegrown Japanese folk rock had developed by the late 1960s. Happy End are credited as the first rock band to sing in the Japanese language. Their self- titled debut album was released in August 1970 on the experimental record label URC (Underground Record Club). This album marked an important turning point in Japanese music history, as it sparked what would be known as the . There were highly publicized debates held between prominent figures in the rock industry, most notably the members of Happy End and Yuya Uchida, regarding whether Japanese rock music sung entirely in Japanese was sustainable. The success of Happy End's debut album and their second, Kazemachi Roman released in November 1971, proved the sustainability of Japanese-language rock music in Japan. The Okinawan band Champloose, along with Carol (led by Eikichi Yazawa), RC Succession and Shinji Harada were especially famous and helped define the sound. Sometimes also beginning in the late sixties, but mostly active in the seventies, are musicians mixing rock music with American-style folk and pop elements, usually labelled \\"folk\\" by the Japanese because of their regular use of the acoustic guitar. This includes bands like Off Course, Tulip, Alice (led by Shinji Tanimura), Kaguyahime, Banban, Garo and Ged≈ç. Solo artists of the same movement include Yosui Inoue, Yuming, and Iruka. Later groups, like Kai Band (led by Yoshihiro Kai) and early Southern All Stars, are often attached to the same movement. =Experimental and electronic= Yellow Magic Orchestra in 2008 Several Japanese musicians began experimenting with electronic rock in the early 1970s. The most notable was the internationally renowned Isao Tomita, whose 1972 album Electric Samurai: Switched on Rock featured electronic synthesizer renditions of contemporary rock and pop songs. Other early examples of electronic rock records include Inoue Yousui's folk rock and pop rock album Ice World (1973) and Osamu Kitajima's progressive psychedelic rock album Benzaiten (1974), both of which involved contributions from Haruomi Hosono, (Translation) who later started the electronic music group \\"Yellow Magic Band\\" (later known as Yellow Magic Orchestra) in 1977. Most influentially, the 1970s spawned the electronic music band Yellow Magic Orchestra, led by Haruomi Hosono. 1980s to 1990s =Punk, original band boom= Bo√∏wy performing in 1984. Early examples of Japanese punk rock include SS, the Star Club, the Stalin, Inu, Gaseneta, Bomb Factory, Lizard (who were produced by the Stranglers) and Friction (whose guitarist Reck had previously played with Teenage Jesus and the Jerks before returning to Tokyo) and the Blue Hearts. The early punk scene was immortalized on film by Sogo Ishii, who directed the 1982 film Burst City featuring a cast of punk bands/musicians and also filmed videos for The Stalin. In the 1980s, Japanese hardcore bands such as GISM, Gauze, Confuse, Lip Cream and Systematic Death began appearing, some incorporating crossover elements. The independent scene also included a diverse number of alternative/post-punk/new wave artists such as Aburadako, P-Model, Uchoten, Auto-Mod, Buck-Tick, Guernica and Yapoos (both of which featured Jun Togawa), G-Schmitt, Totsuzen Danball, and Jagatara, along with noise/industrial bands such as Hijokaidan and Hanatarashi. In the 1980s, acts such as Bo√∏wy inspired what is called the , popularizing the formation of rock groups. In 1980, Huruoma and Ry Cooder, an American musician, collaborated on a rock album with Shoukichi Kina, driving force behind the aforementioned Okinawan band Champloose. They were followed by Sandii & the Sunsetz, who further mixed Japanese and Okinawan influences. Alternative rock bands like Shonen Knife, Boredoms and The Pillows formed. Nirvana's Kurt Cobain admitted to be a fan of Shonen Knife during the girls' tour in the LA in 1991. Cobain later asked the band to join them in a tour in the U.S. to which Shonen Knife accepted.SUMMER SONIC 08 LIVE REPORT =Visual kei= X Japan at Madison Square Garden in 2014. Also during the 1980s, Japanese metal and rock bands gave birth to the movement known as visual kei. Taking visual influence from Western glam rock and glam metal, it was pioneered by bands like X Japan, Dead End, Buck-Tick, D'erlanger, and Color. Although starting in the early 1980s, it was not until the tail-end of the decade that visual kei acts saw major success. Buck-Tick's 1988 album Seventh Heaven reached number 3 on the Oricon chart, and its follow-ups Taboo (1989) and Aku no Hana (1990) both topped it. In April 1989, X Japan's second album Blue Blood reached number 6 and sold 712,000 copies. Their third and best-selling album Jealousy was released in July 1991, topped the charts and sold over 1 million copies. They released two more number one studio albums, Art of Life (1993) and Dahlia (1996), before disbanding in 1997. X Japan signed an American record deal with Atlantic Records in 1992, but an international release never happened. In the 1990s, Luna Sea and Glay sold millions of records, while Malice Mizer, La'cryma Christi, and Siam Shade also found success. 1990s to 2000s: Peak and later developments In the 1990s, Japanese rock musicians such as B'z, Mr. Children, Glay, Southern All Stars, L'Arc-en-Ciel, Tube, Spitz, Wands, T-Bolan, Judy and Mary, Asian Kung‚ÄìFu Generation, Field of View, Deen, Ulfuls, Lindberg, Sharam Q, the Yellow Monkey, the Brilliant Green and Dragon Ash achieved great commercial success. B'z is the best selling artist in Japan with over 86 million confirmed records sold and they are speculated to have sold 100 million worldwide. The duo are also the first Asian band to be inducted in the Hollywood's RockWalk. In the 1990s, pop songs were often used in films, anime, television advertisement and dramatic programming, becoming some of the best-selling forms of music in Japan. The rise of disposable pop has been linked with the popularity of karaoke, leading to criticism that it is consumerist: Kazufumi Miyazawa of the Boom said \\"I hate that buy, listen, and throw away and sing at a karaoke bar mentality.\\" Of the visual kei bands, Luna Sea, whose members toned down their on-stage attire with on-going success, was very successful, while Malice Mizer, La'cryma Christi, Shazna, Janne Da Arc, and Fanatic Crisis also achieved commercial success in the late 1990s. Ska-punk bands of the late nineties extending in the years 2000 include Shakalabbits and 175R. Green Stage of the Fuji Rock Festival The first Fuji Rock Festival opened in 1997. The following year, Supercar released its influential debut album Three Out Change. Characterized as having \\"almost foundational importance to 21st century Japanese indie rock\\", Supercar remained active through 2005 with their later albums containing more electronic rock. Around the same time, bands such as Quruli and Number Girl had begun heavily influencing Japanese alternative rock. Music critic Ian Martin wrote that, along with Supercar, these groups had demonstrated that \\"Japanese rock bands could take on the British and American alternative bands of the 90s at their own game ... and in doing so, they had laid new ground for Japanese rock to develop in its own way from this point on.\\" Rising Sun Rock Festival opened in 1999. Summer Sonic Festival and Rock in Japan Festival opened in 2000. Though the rock scene in the 2000s is not as strong, newer bands such as Bump of Chicken, ONE OK ROCK, Sambomaster, Flow, Orange Range, Remioromen, Uverworld, Radwimps, and Aqua Timez, which are considered rock bands, have achieved success. Orange Range also adopts hip hop. Established bands as B'z, Mr. Children, Glay, and L'Arc-en-Ciel also continue to top charts, though B'z and Mr. Children are the only bands to maintain a high standards of their sales along the years. Japanese rock has a vibrant underground rock scene, best known internationally for noise rock bands such as Boredoms and Melt Banana, as well as stoner rock bands such as Boris and alternative acts such as Shonen Knife (who were championed in the West by Kurt Cobain), Pizzicato Five, and the Pillows (who gained international attention in 1999 for the FLCL soundtrack). More conventional indie rock artists such as Eastern Youth, the Band Apart and Number Girl have found some success in Japan, but little recognition outside of their home country. Other notable international touring indie rock acts are Mono and Nisennenmondai. In the 2000s, the number of all-female rock bands all-female band started to grow. Two of the first of such groups to achieve success were Zone and Chatmonchy. Zone, which was planned to be an idol group, became a rock band thanks to one of their producers, who had decided to let them play with instruments, and was well received. The quartet from Osaka, Scandal, was created in 2006 and sold 52,956 copies of their debut album in 2009. Later, their albums also became top ten bestsellers. This success led them to become famous worldwide and later took them on several tours abroad. In 2018, Scandal established their own label \\"her\\". The 2010s =New band boom, further overseas recognition= L'Arc~en~Ciel performing at Madison Square Garden in 2012, the first Japanese act to headline the venue. During the late 2000s there was an increasing number of bands that had built up a strong fan base prior to their main break-through in the music industry. Indie band flumpool sold over one million copies of their first digital single \\"Hana ni nare\\". Sakanaction performed their first live concert at Nippon Budokan while enjoying major success with their singles \\"Aruku Around\\" and \\"Rookie\\". Sakanaction was pinned as a different type of band since they experimented with electronic music and synthrock. Other bands that have gone mainstream included Gesu no Kiwami Otome, Sekai no Owari, and Alexandros. Because of the sudden major increase on indie bands and rock bands in general which competed with contemporary J-Pop artists, the movement has been referred to as a band boom by the media and has been praised as a change to the Japanese music in general. Since these bands don't rely in a very heavy sound but take a softer, catchier approach, they proved to be more appealing to pop fans that are not familiar with rock. Veteran rock bands like L'Arc~en~Ciel and X Japan sold out concerts at Madison Square Garden in 2012 and 2014, respectively, among other large arenas through the United States. One OK Rock performed at the Taipei Arena, being the first time a Japanese band did so, and additionally sold out shows at the AsiaWorld- Arena and Mall of Asia Arena, the largest overseas shows they had to date with an average attendance of 12,000 people at each concert. Slap-guitarist Miyavi, who has his roots in visual kei, has toured worldwide extensively since 2008, when his This Iz The Japanese Kabuki Rock Tour 2008 tour covered a distance of approximately 48,385 miles, equivalent to almost two trips around the world, and the majority of the concerts were sold out and covered extensively by media organizations. It was the most successful international tour undertaken by a Japanese artist in history. As of 2015, Miyavi had performed at 250 concerts in more than 30 countries around the world. =Girls Metal Band Boom= The decade saw a , with a large number of all-female heavy metal bands forming and gaining mainstream attention. Although not the first to form, Aldious have been cited as the initiators of the movement when their debut album Deep Exceed (2010) topped the Oricon Indies Albums Chart and reached number 15 on the main chart. Another notable girls metal band is Cyntia, who are believed to be the first of the movement to sign to a major record label when they joined Victor Entertainment in 2013. The year 2014 brought the international success of self-described \\"kawaii metal\\" idol act Babymetal, through the viral YouTube hit \\"Gimme Chocolate!!\\". They were the opening act to five of Lady Gaga's concerts on her ArtRave: The Artpop Ball 2014 tour. In 2016, Babymetal began a world tour at London's Wembley Arena, becoming the first Japanese act to headline the venue, and their album Metal Resistance reached number 15 on the UK Albums Chart, marking the highest ever entry by a Japanese act. They also made their US television debut by performing \\"Gimme Chocolate!!\\" on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Band- Maid earned worldwide attention circa 2015 for their \\"submissive\\" maid appearance contrasting with their aggressive music. They began international activities the following year, including signing to JPU Records. In 2018, Lovebites won the Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards for Best New Band and became the first Japanese all-female heavy metal band to perform at Germany's Wacken Open Air.

There are different approaches to multi-time- step integration. They are based on domain decomposition and can be classified into strong (monolithic) or weak (staggered) schemes. Using different time- steps or time-integrators in the context of a weak algorithm is rather straightforward, because the numerical solvers operate independently. However, this is not the case in a strong algorithm. In the past few years a number of research articles have addressed the development of strong multi-time-step algorithms. In either case, strong or weak, the numerical accuracy and stability needs to be carefully studied.

Swedish forces led by Carl Gustaf Wrangel and Hans Christoff von K√∂nigsmarck and Bernardines led by Jean-Baptiste Budes, Comte de Gu√©briant withstood an assault by Imperial forces led by Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, forcing the Imperials to retreat. Preliminaries Wolfenb√ºttel, occupied by Imperial forces, was a strategically insignificant town, but it held great value to the Swedes' Guelph allies. A Guelph army under Hans Caspar von Klitzing had blockaded the Imperial garrison under Johann Ernst, Baron von Ruischenberg since the previous autumn, but its 7,000 troops had been too small a force to reduce the town. Facing growing uncertainty in the wake of the death of General Johan Ban√©r and mutinous troops following a year of inaction and failure, the Swedes needed to do something to ensure Guelph loyalty and prove to other German Protestant allies that they were still a reliable partner. Thus, they decided to assist in the Guelph siege of Wolfenb√ºttel. Hearing word of the Swedish advance, an Imperial army under Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria and Ottavio Piccolomini raced to meet them. The race was essentially a draw. The Swedes under Carl Gustaf Wrangel and their Bernardine allies led by French general Jean-Baptiste Budes, Comte de Gu√©briant joined Klitzing's troops on 28 June, and the Imperial army arrived just two hours later. The battle The besiegers had created a fortified camp that was too hard to take by frontal assault, so Leopold Wilhelm ordered flanking attacks on both sides. Piccolomini's cavalry attacked the Swedish left, but was driven back with light casualties. Meanwhile, the Bavarians under Joachim Christian von Wahl attacked the Swedish right through a woods containing a small redoubt manned by Ban√©r's legendary \\"Old Blue\\" Swedish regiment. The Bavarians took heavy casualties storming the woods but finally succeeded in taking the redoubt from the \\"Old Blue,\\" only to be driven back by a cavalry counterattack dispatched by Gu√©briant from the main camp. At this point, Leopold Wilhelm decided to withdraw, having taken around 3,000 casualties in total, although the Swedes had also paid a heavy price for their \\"victory,\\" having lost 2,000 men, with the heaviest toll coming out of the most experienced and veteran troops of the \\"Old Blue\\" regiment.

The third known system of the 1875 Atlantic hurricane season, the storm was first considered a tropical cyclone while located east of the Lesser Antilles on September 8\\\\. While passing through the Windward Islands. After entering the Caribbean Sea, the cyclone gradually began to move more northwestward and brushed the Tiburon Peninsula of Haiti late on September 12\\\\. On the following day, the storm made a few landfalls on the southern coast of Cuba before moving inland over Sancti Sp√≠ritus Province. The system emerged into the Gulf of Mexico near Havana and briefly weakened to a tropical storm. Thereafter, the storm slowly re-intensified and gradually turned westward. On September 16, the hurricane peaked as a Category 3 hurricane with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h). Later that day, the hurricane made landfall near Indianola, Texas. The storm quickly weakened and turned northeastward, before dissipating over Mississippi on September 18\\\\. The hurricane brought heavy rainfall to several islands of the Lesser Antilles, especially on Barbados and Saint Vincent. The latter reported significant damage and loss of life, including a ship that sunk with the loss of 20 crew members. Flooding and landslides caused severe damage to crops and roads, while two bridges and several homes were swept away, including more than 30 homes in total from the towns of Hopewell and Mesopotamia. Another 20 lives were lost after the ship Codfish sank offshore Martinique. Navassa Island experienced strong winds, heavy rainfall, and very large waves, downing many trees and destroying several homes. Strong winds and above normal tides in Cuba left damage across the island, especially in J√∫caro (close to Venezuela, Cuba) and Santa Cruz del Sur. In Texas, the storm completely destroyed Velasco and nearly destroyed the town of Indianola. In the latter, storm surge washed away three-quarters of the buildings and significantly damaged the structures that remained standing. Only eight buildings in the town were undamaged. Four people drowned after the two lighthouses at Pass Cavallo were swept away. At Galveston, several houses and a railroad bridge were destroyed, and a ship, the Beardstown sunk in Galveston Bay. The town suffered about $4 million in damage and 30 deaths. Overall, the hurricane caused approximately 800 deaths, with at least 300 in Indianola alone. Meteorological history The hurricane or its precursor was first observed on September 1 by the ship Tautallon Castle, which was located southwest of Cape Verde. The storm moved westward and was later encountered on September 5 by a vessel which observed \\"terrific seas\\" and a barometric pressure of . However, HURDAT - the Atlantic hurricane database - does not confirm the existence of a tropical cyclone until 00:00 UTC on September 8, while the storm was situated about 285 miles (260 km) east-northeast of Barbados. Initially estimated to have been a Category 1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale, the system moved westward to west-northwestward, passing through the Windward Islands between Martinique and St. Lucia early on September 9\\\\. The cyclone was estimated to have intensified into a Category 2 hurricane around 00:00 UTC on September 11\\\\. Thereafter, the system began moving in a more northwestward direction. Late on September 12, the hurricane brushed the Tiburon Peninsula of Haiti. Continuing northwestward, the cyclone made landfall near Pil√≥n, Cuba, with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h), shortly before 06:00 UTC on September 13\\\\. The storm briefly re-emerged into the Caribbean and weakened to a Category 1 hurricane before making landfall on the south coast of modern-day Sancti Sp√≠ritus Province around 18:00 UTC with winds of 90 mph (150 km/h). Early the following day, the system emerged into the Straits of Florida and weakened to a tropical storm at about 06:00 UTC on September 14, before becoming a Category 1 hurricane again six hours later. Early on September 15, the cyclone curved to the west- northwest and re-intensified further, becoming a Category 2 hurricane again by 12:00 UTC. About 24 hours later, the system intensified into a Category 3 hurricane and peaked with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph (185 km/h). Around 21:00 UTC on September 16, the hurricane made landfall near Indianola, Texas, at the same intensity. Based on sustained winds of 115 mph (185 km/h) and the pressure‚Äìwind relationship developed by National Hurricane Center meteorologist Dan Brown in 2006, the barometric pressure was estimated at , the lowest associated with the storm. The hurricane curved northward after moving inland and quickly weakened to a tropical storm by 12:00 UTC the next day. Turning northeastward shortly thereafter, the system weakened to a tropical depression on June 18 and dissipated over southern Mississippi around 18:00 UTC that same day. Preparations and impact Caribbean On Saint Vincent, the hurricane was \\"accompanied by a deluge of rain unprecedented\\", with nearly of precipitation falling in 12 hours. Loss of lives and severe damage to properties were reported by The Times. Landslides occurred throughout the island, causing heavy damage, especially to agriculture. At one plantation alone, the storm destroyed nearly of sugar cane. A number of roads were left impassible. The storm also demolished several arrowroot mills, which were generally owned by poor Black cultivators. In the Kingstown area, local streams, some of which typically resembled arroyos, rose as much as in six hours. Most of the streets were flooded with over of water, while marketplaces and low-lying areas were also inundated. Many homes and two bridges were swept away. At the Roman Catholic cemetery, floodwaters unearthed several recently interred bodies and swept them into the ocean. Along the coast, seven of the ten vessels docked at the bay were beached. In the Mariaqua Valley of Saint Vincent, hundreds of people fled their homes from the villages of Hopewell and Mesopotamia. Water swept away more than 30 homes in total from both villages. Four people drowned in Mesopotamia. Additionally, five fatalities occurred in Queensbury. During the storm, the volcano La Soufri√®re showed signs of activation. Following the storm, the Legislative Assembly of Saint Vincent voted to allocate ¬£500 (US$2776) for repairing roads and ¬£300 (US$1666) for relief to those whose homes were destroyed. A total of 52 people were granted aid, many of whom lived in Mesopotamia. On Barbados, several locations reported around of precipitation, while up to of rain was observed. Three vessels on the island were driven ashore. The ship Codfish sank at a harbor in Martinique, drowning all 20 crew members. In Haiti, the schooner Agnes became stranded at Les Cayes. Additionally, several coasters and two foreign ships were grounded. Heavy rainfall and strong winds were also reported on Navassa Island. Many trees were brought down and several homes were destroyed. One building was lifted and smashed, and all wooden structures were demolished. The railroad was torn up, while eight loaded train cars were tossed from the track. A flat stone weighing 25 tons disappeared during the storm. Along the coast, waves crashed over cliffs that were in height. Boathouses and wharves were demolished, while a gig and eight lighters capsized. Jamaica experienced storm surge, heavy rainfall, and near-hurricane-force winds. In Falmouth, storm surge inundated roads. Adverse weather conditions briefly interrupted communications between Holland Bay and Kingston, as well as between Holland Bay and Santiago de Cuba. The Belen College Observatory in Havana, Cuba, issued a storm warning on September 11, as forecasters anticipated that the hurricane would continue west-northwestward and strike the island. This was the first issuance of a tropical cyclone-related warning in the Caribbean Sea. The well-publicized warning was credited with saving many lives. Tides in Cuba reached above normal at the bay in Santiago de Cuba. A severe thunderstorm associated with the hurricane killed a girl, and injured two men at a fishing village. The hurricane destroyed a section of railroad in Guant√°namo. Strong winds and above normal tides left damage across the island, particularly in J√∫caro and Santa Cruz del Sur. In the latter, the tides inundated many streets. Strong winds destroyed all shacks and partially damaged even the strongest buildings. United States In Louisiana, the hurricane sunk or swept ashore several ships along the coast. Even at the protected New Orleans harbor, ships foundered. Communications with the schooner Mabel was lost after it sailed out of the mouth of the Mississippi River. The state experienced more intense impacts after the storm moved eastward out of Texas. At Shell Island, located near the west end of Vermilion Bay, tides exceeded those during the 1856 hurricane. In New Orleans, the steamer Natchez collided with the ferry Lousie. The boats linked together and drifted down the Mississippi River, until the Natchez was re-secured after passing the Belle Rowland and the C. H. Dufree. In St. Mary Parish, 34 hours of heavy rainfall and storm surge generated by \\"tremendous equinoctial storm\\" caused considerable damage to cotton and sugar cane. Inland, observers in Calcasieu Parish noted that the wind shifted with \\"terrific force\\" as the storm crossed Louisiana. Indianola, Texas, in 1875 The storm brought a strong storm surge to the Texas coast, causing heavy damage and a total of 800 deaths. Three-quarters of the buildings in Indianola were washed away and the remaining structures were in a state of ruin, with only eight buildings left undamaged. Boats were washed as far as inland. The town may have experienced winds gusts between , though the anemometer blew away after recording a wind gust of . Approximately 300 people were killed in Indianola. In the aftermath of the storm in Indianola, looters stole possessions from the deceased. Fifteen people caught looting from the dead were killed. Surviving residents of Indianola debated relocating the town. However, considerations were dropped after political ambitions interfered. The town would be rebuilt, only to be devastated again by the 1886 hurricane. In Cameron County, damage to a railroad resulted in a suspension of service between Brownsville and Port Isabel. The sand dunes on Matagorda Island were flattened. The hurricane killed approximately 90% of residents of Saluria, located on the eastern end of the island. Two lighthouses at Pass Cavallo were swept away, including the four light keepers. Velasco was completely leveled. The city was not rebuilt until 1888, at which time it had been relocated about farther upstream the Brazos River. At Galveston, tides reached up to above normal, cutting two temporary channels across the island. Several houses on the eastern side of the island and a railroad bridge were destroyed. In Galveston Bay, the steamer Beardstown sunk. The storm dropped of rainfall on September 17 - a record for that date. Winds possibly reached , with the wind being \\"higher and harder\\" than during the 1867 hurricane. Hurricane warning flags Farther north, Harrisburg and Houston were impacted by the hurricane. Water from Galveston Bay at Houston swept farther inland than ever recorded at the time. Trees were brought down throughout the city, with some streets resembling \\"forests just cut down\\", according to The Daily News. Fallen trees and fences blocked sidewalks on Congress Street. A number of homes were deroofed. Three buildings at the fairgrounds were destroyed. Heavy rainfall flooded some streets. Two bridges over White Oak Bayou were washed away, while a few houses along the bank of the bayou were also swept away. Damage in Houston reached about $50,000. In Spring, heavy precipitation caused streams to overflow and streets to quickly flood, with The Daily News noting that floodwaters took \\"almost everything within its reach.\\" A combination of strong winds and torrential rains damaged several miles of railroad tracks and washed out several roads. Cotton crops were completely wiped out. In Wallisville, several buildings were demolished, while moderate damage occurred in Beaumont and Liberty. Strong winds buffeted Austin County for about 48 hours, causing severe damage to vegetation and downing many trees. The storm left a lasting impact on warnings being issued for hurricanes. Within the United States, the public was dissatisfied with the Signal Corp forecasts after the Indianola hurricane. The immediate response by the Signal Corp was the creation of the hurricane warning flag, a pair of red flags each in size, inset with black rectangles. From October 1, 1875, hurricane warning flags were hoisted in areas where hurricane warnings were in effect, and illuminated at night.

The division was to be made fairly, and so every single field plot was therefore divided. The plots of land therefore became increasingly smaller, and each user received an increasingly complex property to deal with. References Further reading *Visted, Kristofer, & Hilmar Stigum. 1971.

The term \\"ace\\" in relation to individual military success originated with French military propaganda of World War I. Ace, when used in the context of military propaganda, denotes a successful military professional who has accumulated a meaningfully measurable statistic such as aircraft shot down, tonnage sunk, or a number of successful sniper shots.[Robertson, Linda Raine. The dream of civilized warfare: World War I flying aces and the American imagination. U of Minnesota Press, 2003. In a manner analogous to sport statistics, some military roles can be measured in terms of a quantifiable metric. Once said metric is established, military personnel (whether within the same force, in different forces, or in different eras) may be quantified versus the designated metric and compared in a tabular fashion. Such metrics may be used as a basis for military merit awards, such as Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross[Williamson, Gordon. Knight's Cross and Oak-Leaves Recipients 1939? 40. Bloomsbury Publishing, 2012.] by setting an arbitrary threshold. Likewise, a designation of \\"ace\\" (\\"double ace\\", \\"triple ace\\", etc.) may be applied, such as 5 aircraft shoot downs. The ace achieved success with \\"skill and luck, and if victorious won the accolades of the patriotic public\\". The usage of the term in popular culture evolved to include \\"tank aces\\" (\\"Panzer aces\\") and \\"submarine aces\\". Flying aces The term is most commonly applied to military aviators, especially fighter pilots, who are often described as \\"flying aces\\". The term \\"ace\\" in relation to individual military success originated with French military propaganda of World War I. The as de l'aviation (the flying ace) was used for fighter pilots who had shot down a certain number of enemy aircraft, usually five or more. It has been picked up particularly by the United States Army Air Service and its propaganda. The emergence of the solo \\"flying ace\\" can be traced to the introduction of the single-seater fighter airplane in 1915. The image created by the state propaganda was that of \\"chevalier of the skies\\", the successor of the medieval knight at a joust. According to Nicole-Melanie Goll, the popular perception of one-on-one duels was divorced from reality, however, as planes rarely broke formation. The ace was supposed to be in control of his destiny, and could only be defeated by an equally skillful opponent. Hence, being shot down by ground anti-aircraft fire was considered to be a dishonour. According to historian Peter Fritzsche: > The ace in combat is an immediately recognizable image. In control of his > fate, handling his airplane with great courage and skill but also with an > envied recklessness, the aviator appeared to be a genuine war hero, > comparable to cavalrymen in Napoleon's era or chivalrous knights in the > Middle Ages. [...] To this day, myths opposing the individual, distinctive > combat of the aces to the industrial mass war on the ground remain deeply > embedded in Western folklore. Tank and submarine \\"aces\\" The term \\"tank ace\\" is occasionally applied to tank crew. For instance, Sydney Radley-Walters' obituary published in The Globe and Mail in 2015 described him as the \\"best Canadian front-line tank ace\\" of World War II. Robert Kershaw in his book \\"Tank Men\\" refers to a \\"Tank Ace\\" being the minority of tank commanders that accounted for the most destroyed enemy armour, saying it is roughly analogous with flying ace. Soviet tankers with over five kills, such as Dmitry Lavrinenko and Zinovy Kolobanov, have also been referred to as \\"tank aces\\". Many German U-boat commanders of World War II, especially Gunther Prien, Otto Kretschmer and Wolfgang L√ºth, have been popularised in German war-time propaganda and popular literature. According to historian Michael L. Hadley, > Literature of World War II heightened the features that earlier cults of the > hero [of the German U-boat arm] had promoted. This was the era of the \\"grey > wolves\\" and \\"steel sharks\\", when wolf packs, officially designated by such > predatory names \\"robber baron\\" and \\"bludgeon\\", attacked the Allies' convoys. > Widespread popularization of the U-boat aces, of their images and deeds > propagated the cult of the personality which even today finds resonance in > the popular market. Sniper aces Due to the individual nature of sniping and the possibility to record the number of successful shots due to the relatively small number of shots taken and due to the target being under observation through the shot, compiling statistics regarding sniper success is possible (List of snipers). Recognition of snipers by production was particularly done in the Eastern Front (World War II) and was used for war-time propaganda and remained relevant in popular culture after the war,Sniper Ace: From the Eastern Front to Siberia, Bruno Sutkus, Enemy at the Gates and has continued to remain culturally relevant also in post-2000 conflicts.Coughlin, Sgt Jack, Casey Kuhlman, and Donald A.

It is located between Wilders Plads to the south and Gr√∏nlandske Handels Plads to the north. The current buildings were completed in 2016 and are inspired by the historic warehouses that dominate the waterfront. History Kr√∏yers Plads is part of an area that was reclaimed by Andreas Bj√∏rn for use as a shipyard in the 1750s. The northern part of the area was acquired by the Royal Greenland Trade Department in the 1790s and became known as Gr√∏nlandske Handels Plads. The southern part of the area was purchased by the captain and merchant Hans Kr√∏yer in 18+2. The site was reacquired by the Royal Greenland Trade Department in 1938. The ships were moved to Aalborg in the 1970s. The deserted area was in 1998 ceded to the new state-owned property company Freja Ejendomme. In July 2001, it was converted into am urban beach setting under the name Lufthastellet with the use of 17 t of sand from R√•bjerg Mile. In February 2003, an invited architectural competition was launched for the area. It was won by Erick van Egeraat. In April 2004, NCC acquired Kr√∏yers Plads with the intention of realizing Egeraat's winning proposal. The plans resulted in comprehensive complains from neighbours and interest organisations. In March 2005, the district plan proposal was rejected by the City Council. A new masterplan for the area was subsequently commissioned from a team consisting of Bjarke Ingels Group, Henning Larsen Architects and Kim Utzon Architects. In August 2005, NCC sold the project to Carlyle Group. The new plan for the area was presented in May 2006 but it is once again rejected by City Hall and the project is put on hold as a result of the Financial Crisis. In 2010, NXX reacquired the site. A new plan for the area was subsequently created by Vilhelm Lauritzen Arkitekter, Cobe and GHB Landskabsarkitekter. It was approved in 2011 and construction finally began in autumn 2012. The last phase of the project was completed in 2016.

The platform lets donors see how their money makes an impact through raw video updates. The company is based in Fairfax Station, Virginia. History The company was founded in March 2016 by Gret Glyer, in response to what he saw as poor management of aid money by large aid organisations. Glyer raised $150,000 in seed funding to build the platform on web, iOS and Android and launched it on 26 September 2016. Two weeks after launch, Glyer appeared on the Tom Woods show to talk about DonorSee. In October 2016, DonorSee was listed in USA Today as one of the best ways to give to those affected by Hurricane Matthew in Haiti. On January 26, 2017, the Peace Corps issued a ban preventing their volunteers from using DonorSee. Glyer subsequently initiated a Change.org petition asking that President Trump intervene and lift the ban. Glyer‚Äôs goal for 2017 is to reach $75 million in revenue. On March 14, 2018, DonorSee announced that they would be imposing a maximum donation level of $450 on future projects posted on their platform. On June 3, 2019, Glyer launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the publishing of a book If the Poor Were Next Door, which will detail his experiences with severe poverty which led him to create DonorSee. Business model DonorSee allows aid workers to build a donor base by posting a feed of projects specific to the country they are serving. During this process, members post a picture or video of the potential recipient and a story explaining how the money will be used, along with the amount of money needed. They also have the option to say which country the project is in, and whether or not they want to raise money on a monthly basis. After posting, people can then donate to these projects using a debit or credit card, which is processed by Stripe. Stripe charges a fee averaging 6.25% per donation and DonorSee takes an additional fee averaging 13.75%. After the project is funded, aid workers are expected to post visual follow up, which often includes the donor‚Äôs name in the video. While DonorSee is not a 501(c)(3) organization, certain projects are still 100% tax-deductible. Additionally, DonorSee has implemented an extensive vetting process, through which they claim to reject over 90% of submitted projects.

Pedestals are used for CATV (known as a cable box in such a situation), telephone, PONS, and other telecommunications systems.

The pedestal either has an access panel or removable housing.

Aly Barchi of Complete Music Update described the genre of the song as \\"[a] pastel-shaded take on UK garage, trappy beats and bon-bon dance-pop\\", and the lyrics as \\"‚Äògirl-boy‚Äô lyrics so super-sticky-kitsch\\". Barchi has also described the song as a \\"universal story of ‚Äòa love unrequited', told in the most basic ABC rhymes at top pitch over a ‚ÄòShanks & Bigfoot go to Disneyland‚Äô-style beat\\". Ryan Bassil of Noisey compared the song to a lullaby, commenting that the song is \\"like a lullaby ‚Äì but made for teenagers that send every pink emoji on the iPhone keyboard\\". Brendan Klinkenberg of Pigeons and Planes noted the song to be an example of the uncanny valley, and called the song's lyrics \\"simple and earnest\\". Klinkenberg also noted that Diamond had slightly pitched-up vocals in the song. Maurice Marion of Rare Candy has described \\"Pink and Blue\\" as subtly addressing the cultural issue of sexualizing and infantilizing pop stars to market music, citing perceived sexual lyrics such as \\"hey, why don‚Äôt you hit me up?\\", Diamond‚Äôs \\"baby-talk vocals\\", and the song's \\"sugary production\\" as pushing the aforementioned issue to a \\"self-conscious extreme\\". Critical reception \\"Pink and Blue\\" has received general acclaim from music critics. George Awwad of Portals called the song a \\"great introduction to PC Music‚Äôs catalog\\". Awwad also praised the track's vocals and production together, and commended the line \\"Hey why don‚Äôt you hit me up\\". Chris Taylor of The 405 praised the song's catchiness. Aly Barchi of Complete Music Update said, of the song, \\"‚ÄòPink And Blue‚Äô is at once ‚Äòjust a dumb pop song‚Äô and also a highly smart bit of manufacturing. And so, so good‚Ä¶ infuriatingly good.\\" Jamie Milton of DIY honored the song as \\"THE BIG NEU THING\\", and called the song \\"one of the most insanely addictive tracks of the year [2013]\\". Without giving a personal opinion on \\"Pink and Blue\\", Brendan Klinkenberg of Pigeons and Planes noted that Diamond's \\"childlike\\" vocal delivery, persona, and its focus on falling in love, has caused the general response to the song to be divided. FACT placed \\"Pink and Blue\\" on a 2014 list titled \\"PC Music: the 10 best tracks so far from 2014‚Äôs most divisive record label\\". FACT also ranked the song at number five for their 2014 list of \\"The 100 best tracks of the decade so far\\", commenting that the song \\"captures what‚Äôs great about the label [PC Music]\\". FACT further praised the song, calling it an \\"addictive, ambivalent confection\\". Ally Barchi of Complete Music Update has credited \\"Pink and Blue\\" with introducing PC Music to a broader audience. In a 2016 article about PC Music, Kyle MacNeill of Thump deemed \\"Pink and Blue\\" \\"arguably the strongest track to emerge from the collective\\". Live performances \\"Pink and Blue\\" was performed live for the first time on 4 April 2014 at The London Edition Hotel, for Diamond's debut live performance. Tamara Roper of The 405 called the performance of the song \\"a bit dry\\", but noticed that the audience sang along to the Diamond's presentation, and that Diamond elicited a positive audience reaction. The song was included on Diamond's setlist at the Empire Garage in Austin, Texas, on 19 March 2015. Stephen Carlick of Exclaim! deemed the performance, as a whole, a 7/10, noticing Diamond \\"sounded more like she was singing\\" while she was performing \\"Pink and Blue\\", in opposed to lip- syncing.

His research centres on vocational learning, workplace learning, and learning for vocational purposes.  Biography Stephen Billett earned a Diploma of Teaching in technical and further education from the Brisbane College of Advanced Education (1984), a B.A. in humanities (1987) and a M.Ed. (1990) from the University of Queensland, and a Ph.D. in education (1995) from Griffith University. His thesis, titled Structuring Knowledge Through Authentic Activities, was presented in 1995. His primary doctoral supervisor was John Stevenson, along with Peter Freebody. During his Ph.D. studies, he took up a position as lecturer at Griffith University's School of Education and Professional Studies (1992‚Äì97), from which he was promoted to senior lecturer (1997-2000), associate professor (2001‚Äì07) and eventually to Professor of Adult and Vocational Education (in 2008). He has worked for the Australian Research Council and sits on the editorial and advisory boards of several academic journals, including the Journal on Workplace Learning, Vocations and Learning, and Empirical Research in Vocational Education and Training. Previously, Billett had a career in garment manufacturing. In 2013, he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by the University of Jyvaskala.  Research  Stephen Billett's research centres on the topic of learning through and for work, pertaining to the fields of vocational learning, workplace learning, and of conceptual accounts of learning for vocational purposes. Since the 1990s, Billett's research has consistently emphasized the potential of workplace learning, conceptualizing workplaces as learning environments where the use of knowledge, roles and processes are continuously negotiated, framing the learner's participation in situated work activities, and appreciating practical knowledge. In particular, he envisions learning as the transformatory result of individuals' participation in goal-directed activities - situated learning -, with the social circumstances of the learning influencing the development of knowledge, which in turn has consequences in terms of cognitive changes. In his research, he notably found that guided learning interactions in the workplace may improve the efficacy of workers in performing new tasks in ways that cannot be (readily) achieved through everyday work activities alone, even though the latter are most valued by workers. Moreover, Billett repeatedly emphasizes that the types and quality of learning occurring in the workplace are determined by individuals' engagement in the workplace and workplaces' readiness to afford individuals with opportunities for engaging in work and to support them in doing so, with the latter increasing the former if individuals are interested in learning. These two topics - individuals' co-participation in work practices within a certain social setting - and workplaces' readiness to offer learning opportunities - are also returning themes in his work on workplace pedagogies and curricula; for instance, he makes the case for a participatory workplace pedagogy based on guidance and participatory practices in the workplace and individuals' engagement in those practices. Billett has been critical of descriptions of workplace learning as inherently \\"informal\\", arguing that workplace learning may display many characteristics of formal learning, and that learning should rather be conceptualised in terms of participatory practices wrought between the ppersonal and vocational goals of individuals and the needs of workplaces. Together with Margaret Somerville, he has also highlighted how workplace practices shape individuals' identities and are, in turn, shaped by workers based on their subjective experiences, e.g. if they demand better occupational health and safety in order to improve the quality and perception of their occupation; however, the learning process underlying such actions is hardly taken into account by most lifelong learning policies. This emphasis on individual agency is also present in his analysis of the interdependance between individual and social agencies and, more specifically, the role of individual agency (e.g. intentionality, subjectivity or identity), its shaping by society over time and effect on cognitive experience, and its role in the social construction of experiences. Finally, more recently, Billett has pleaded for the inclusion and integration of practice-based experiences in higher education, which requires close relations between academic institutions and practice settings and their personnel, while recognizing that both learning environments may have different imperatives. As a Future Fellow of the Australian Research Council, Billett led a research project on the development of a curriculum, pedagogy and epistemology of practice aimed at enhancing and legitimating practice-based learning experiences from 2011 to 2015. Currently (2015-2018), he manages a research project on how to increase students' employability by improving post-practicum educational processes.

Joint venture company  Under the plan, the government invested NZ$28 million into a joint venture company, Predator Free 2050 Ltd, with a plan for an additional $1 added for each $2 invested by the public, third parties such as philanthropic foundations or local councils. It was later reported that they had also pledged an additional $7 million per year after the initial $28 million was provided over the first four years. On 25 July 2017, Conservation Minister Maggie Barry spoke about the project, calling it \\"the most important conservation project in the history of our country\\" and also said that Predator Free 2050 Ltd was planning to announce the first major project it would be funding before the end of 2017.  Goals  Aside from the stated goal of eradicating all predator species by 2050, the Department of Conservation has outlined four interim 2025 goals: * Suppress predators on a further 1 million hectares. * Eradicate predators from at least 20,000 hectares without the use of fences. * Eradicate predators from island nature reserves. * Achieve a breakthrough science solution capable of eradicating at least one small mammal predator. Former Prime Minister John Key stated in mid 2016 that current technologies and methods would be insufficient for the ultimate goal of the project, and were banking on a 'new scientific breakthrough' to allow for the eradication of possums, stoats, and rats. Supporting large-scale projects PF2050 Ltd called for expressions of interest from parties that are capable and committed to achieving the Government‚Äôs ambitious goal to rid New Zealand of possums, rats and stoats by 2050. PF2050 wishes to identify regional/local councils, communities, mana whenua, businesses, NGOs and/or other entities who have predator eradication initiatives either underway or contemplated that can contribute toward meeting its interim (2025) goals identified above. A selection of projects will enter a request-for-proposal stage with the aim of approving the first projects for PF2050 investment by mid-February 2018.

A simple example of univariate data would be the salaries of workers in industry. Like all the other data, univariate data can be visualized using graphs, images or other analysis tools after the data is measured, collected, reported, and analyzed.  Univariate data types  Some univariate data consists of numbers (such as the height of 65 inches or the weight of 100 pounds), while others are nonnumerical (such as eye colors of brown or blue). Generally, the terms categorical univariate data and numerical univariate data are used to distinguish between these types.  Categorical univariate data  Categorical univariate data consist non-numerical observations that may be placed in categories. It includes labels or names used to identify an attribute of each element. Categorical univariate data usually use either nominal or ordinal scale of measurement.  Numerical univariate data  Numerical univariate data consist observations that are numbers. They are obtained using either interval or ratio scale of measurement. This type of univariate data can be classified even further into two subcategories: discrete and continuous. A numerical univariate data is discrete if the set of all possible values is finite or countably infinite. Discrete univariate data are usually associated with counting (such as the number of books read by a person). A numerical univariate data is continuous if the set of all possible values is an interval of numbers. Continuous univariate data are usually associated with measuring (such as the weights of people).  Data analysis and applications  Univariate analysis is the simplest form of analyzing data. Uni means one, so in other words the data has only one variable. Univariate data requires to analyze each variable separately. Data is gathered for the purpose of answering a question, or more specifically, a research question. Univariate data does not answer research questions about relationships between variables, but rather it is used to describe one characteristic or attribute that varies from observation to observation. Usually there are two purposes that a researcher can look for. The first one is to answer a research question with descriptive study and the second one is to get knowledge about how attribute varies with individual effect of a variable in Regression analysis. There are some ways to describe patterns found in univariate data which include graphical methods, measures of central tendency and measures of variability.  Graphical methods The most frequently used graphical illustrations for univariate data are: = Frequency distribution tables = Frequency is how many times a number occurs. The frequency of an observation in statistics tells us the number of times the observation occurs in the data. For example, in the following list of numbers {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 9, 8, 5, 1, 1, 9, 9, 0, 6, 9}, the frequency of the number 9 is 5 (because it occurs 5 times). = Bar charts = This is an example of barplot. Bar chart is a graph consisting of rectangular bars. There bars actually represents number or percentage of observations of existing categories in a variable. The length or height of bars gives a visual representation of the proportional differences among categories. = Histograms = histogram Histograms are used to estimate distribution of the data, with the frequency of values assigned to a value range called a bin. = Pie charts = Pie chart is a circle divided into portions that represent the relative frequencies or percentages of a population or a sample belonging to different categories.  Measures of central tendency  Central tendency is one of the most common numerical descriptive measures. It's used to estimate the central location of the univariate data by the calculation of mean, median and mode. Each of these calculation has its own advantages and limitations. The mean has the advantage that its calculation includes each value of the data set, but it is particularly susceptible to the influence of outliers. The median is a better measure when the data set contains outliers. The mode is simple to locate. The important thing is that it's not restricted to using only one of these measure of central tendency. If the data being analyzed is categorical, then the only measure of central tendency that can be used is the mode. However, if the data is numerical in nature (ordinal or interval/ratio) then the mode, median, or mean can all be used to describe the data. Using more than one of these measures provides a more accurate descriptive summary of central tendency for the univariate.  Measures of variability  A measure of variability or dispersion (deviation from the mean) of a univariate data set can reveal the shape of a univariate data distribution more sufficiently. It will provide some information about the variation among data values. The measures of variability together with the measures of central tendency give a better picture of the data than the measures of central tendency alone. The three most frequently used measures of variability are range, variance and standard deviation. The appropriateness of each measure would depend on the type of data, the shape of the distribution of data and which measure of central tendency are being used. If the data is categorical, then there is no measure of variability to report. For data that is numerical, all three measures are possible. If the distribution of data is symmetrical, then the measures of variability are usually the variance and standard deviation. However, if the data are skewed, then the measure of variability that would be appropriate for that data set is the range.  Univariate distributions  Univariate distribution is a dispersal type of a single random variable described either with a probability mass function (pmf) for discrete probability distribution, or probability density function (pdf) for continuous probability distribution. It is not to be confused with multivariate distribution. Common discrete distributions Uniform distribution (discrete) Bernoulli distribution Binomial distribution Geometric distribution Negative binomial distribution Poisson distribution Hypergeometric distribution Zeta distribution Common continuous distributions Uniform distribution (continuous) Normal distribution Gamma distribution Exponential distribution Weibull distribution Cauchy distribution Beta distribution See also * Univariate * Univariate analysis * Univariate distribution * Bivariate analysis * Multivariate analysis * List of probability distributions References Mathematical terminology Statistical data ","title":"Univariate (statistics)"},{"id":"52897834","title":"List of reptiles of Thailand"},{"id":"52897856","text":"The 1st Weather Reconnaissance Squadron is an inactive United States Army Air Force unit. It saw service between April 1943 and May 1945. On 21 December the squadron was inactivated at Grenier Field, New Hampshire.This unit is not related to the 1st Weather Reconnaissance Squadron (Special), which was organized by Military Air Transport Service on 1 June 1948 at Fairfield-Suisun Air Force Base, California and assigned to the 308th Reconnaissance Group, redesignated 2078th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron (Special) on 1 October 1948, moved to Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma on 10 November 1949, where it was discontinued on 20 March 1950. That squadron used the emblem approved for the 1st Weather Reconnaissance Squadron as well. Markus, p. 152. During World War II the United States had to move large numbers of aircraft to the European and Mediterranean Theaters via the North Atlantic ferry route, a series of short flights between Newfoundland, Labrador, Greenland, Iceland and the UK. Weather conditions in winter closed the route and made crossing perilous at any time. The amount of time the route was open could be increased and the losses en route decreased by accurate weather forecasting. Land based weather stations left large gaps; the solution was the development of airborne meteorology. The 1st Weather Reconnaissance Squadron was formed to gather weather data for the North Atlantic ferry routes, particularly the segments over the ocean. This data was used to provide forecasts for the safe passage of aircraft flying between North America and Britain. It became operational in April 1943 and operated throughout the North Atlantic region.  History   Background  During World War II, the United States had to move large numbers of aircraft to the European and Mediterranean Theaters.Army Air Forces Statistical Digest, 183.47,649 airplanes out of 76,076 total deployed to all theaters overseas, from 1 December 1941 to 1 September 1945. Nearly 15,000 were sent across the North Atlantic to Britain before being dispersed to their areas of operations.Fuller, Thor's Legions, 63. Even before the US entered the war, the British were buying thousands of US planes to build up the Royal Air Force and replace aircraft lost in the Battles of France and Britain.Engel, \\"Half of Everything,\\" 472. While larger, four engine planes could be flown directly, one and two engine planes did not have the necessary range.Bates, America's Weather Warriors, 1814‚Äì1985, 65. At first, these smaller planes were partially disassembled and carried across on cargo ships but that was inefficient, slow, and the ships were often attacked by German submarines.Hague, The Allied Convoy System, 19, 126‚Äì129, 134‚Äì135.Convoys between Halifax, Nova Scotia and Liverpool, England took about two weeks. Loading and unloading took additional time, as did waiting for the convoy to form and waiting for docking at the destination.uboat.net.Sixteen ships carrying airplanes recorded sunk in the North Atlantic between 22 February 1940 and 4 August 1942. Work started in 1940 on an alternative, the North Atlantic ferry route, a series of shorter flights across Newfoundland, Labrador, Greenland and Iceland to the UK.Heck, The North Atlantic Route, 93. The necessary airfields and resources were in place by summer of 1942 for the first large scale flights by the Eighth Air Force.Goldberg, \\"Establishment of the Eighth Air Force in the United Kingdom,\\" 641. Large numbers of aircraft were ferried during the summer but weather conditions in the winter closed the route and made any crossing more perilous.Goldberg, \\"Establishment of the Eighth Air Force in the United Kingdom\\", 644‚Äì645.882 planes reached Britain over the North Atlantic route from 23 June 1942 to 1 January 1943. Most of the planes, a mix of Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses, Lockheed P-38 Lightnings and Douglas C-47 Skytrains, were part of Operation Bolero as the Eighth Air Force relocated to Britain. The stormy and erratic weather in the North Atlantic region presented the same problem faced by ships sailing between North America and Britain, and required the same solution: accurate weather forecasting.Price, \\"The Coast Guard and the North Atlantic Campaign,\\" 7, 9. With the defeat of France, and Germany's aerial attacks on Britain in midyear 1940, it was clear that the Army Air Forces' (AAF) weather services would soon be inadequate to the need.Jonasson, \\"The AAF Weather Service,\\" 314. Facilities and personnel were rapidly produced to provide weather stations, weather observers and weather forecasters.Jonasson, \\"The AAF Weather Service,\\" 316.By 7 December 1941, the weather services had 4,300 officers and men. Importantly, the AAF's weather services were fundamental for the growth of air transport services and the ferrying of aircraft.Jonasson, \\"The AAF Weather Service,\\" 312. Weather stations for the North Atlantic ferry route were developed from Eastern Canada north to the Arctic Circle and east to Iceland.Jonasson, \\"The AAF Weather Service,\\" 321‚Äì322. In addition to readings collected by land stations, data was also available from United States Coast Guard ships on weather patrol in the North Atlantic.Willoughby, The U.S. Coast Guard in World War II, 128.Bates, America's Weather Warriors, 1814‚Äì1985, 60. On 13 August 1941, a detachment of weather officers and men was activated at Gander Airport, Newfoundland, to coordinate and extend the network of facilities and provide forecasts for the area. However, these facilities were still sparse considering the immense region to cover and forecasts were necessary limited.Jonasson, \\"The AAF Weather Service,\\" 322. Data was unavailable for large sections of land and large stretches of the ocean where storm systems could hide. The problem was how to cover this expanse with the scarce resources at hand. The solution was the flying meteorologist.Rand, \\"Atlantic Weather Report (Patrol),\\" 30.  Mission  The squadron‚Äôs mission was to gather weather data over the North Atlantic ferry routes, particularly from the segments over the ocean. This data was used to provide forecasts for the safe passage of aircraft flying between North America and Britain. There were three routes used for this. Two routes had short flights from Canada to Greenland to Iceland and to Scotland. Airplanes could also fly directly from Canada to Scotland.Heck, The North Atlantic Route, 92‚Äì93.Fuller, Thor's Legions, 57.  Organization  Shortly before the US declared war on the Axis powers in 1941, there were discussions at AAF headquarters about organizing several weather reconnaissance squadrons.Jonasson, The AAF Weather Service 332. As a result, the Army Air Forces Weather Reconnaissance Squadron (Test) Number One was constituted in August 1942. It was assigned to the 2d Weather Squadron and stationed at Patterson Field in Ohio.Markus, Air Weather Service, 140. It was tasked with finding the types of equipment, personnel, and procedures necessary for gathering and reporting weather data during flight. The results of this research were supposed to be the basis for forming operational squadrons. But the program lacked support and languished until the next spring.Jonasson, \\"The AAF Weather Service,\\" 332. In April 1943, the squadron was made operational and assigned to Flight Control Command. It moved to Truax Field in Madison, Wisconsin for training.Army Air Forces Weather Unit Histories. In June, its headquarters moved to Presque Isle Army Air Field, Maine under command of Lt. Col. Clark L. Hosmer. In July, it was assigned to the recently activated Army Air Forces Weather Wing.Fuller, Thor's Legions, 42. Hosmer was an important personality in AAF weather circles. He was a pilot, a graduate of West Point and trained in meteorology at the California Institute of Technology.Fuller, Thor's Legions, 56. In August 1941, he was assigned command of the small weather detachment at Gander Airport in Newfoundland, working alongside the Canadian weather unit until their own facilities were ready. Under Hosmer, the detachment developed weather facilities stretching across the North Atlantic Region from Canada to Iceland, and eventually became the 8th Weather Squadron.Jonasson, \\"The AAF Weather Service,\\" 321.The joint American & Canadian facilities at Gander were critical for air operations in the North Atlantic region and became increasingly more important as the war continued. Gander Airport, along with the field at Goose Bay, Labrador, was the western terminus for the cargo, passenger and combat aircraft crossing the North Atlantic Route. Gander was also the operational center of a weather net stretching from the US to Britain and the largest forecast station at the western edge of the Atlantic. When Eighth Air Force moved to Britain in 1942, he stationed his most experienced forecasters along the route. He also persuaded Eighth Air Force commanders to scout the legs of the route ahead of the fighter aircraft with B-17 bombers. As a result, the accident ratio was 5.2%, about half of what was expected. When the Army Air Forces Weather Reconnaissance Squadron (Test) Number One went operational, his knowledge of weather and advocacy of weather reconnaissance made him a natural fit as its commander.Fuller, Thor's Legion, 43, 44n, 62, 63.Hosmer was chief of operations of the AAF Weather Wing under Lt. Col. W.O. Senter when he was assigned. Hosmer served for 14 months before he was reassigned to Headquarters AAF. During that time, he and 58 of his aircrew were awarded medals for their performance.Fuller, Thor's Legion, 63. In December 1943, the squadron was redesignated the 30th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, Air Route, Medium and assigned to Air Transport Command (ATC). ATC grew out of the Air Corps Ferrying Command that started in 1941 when America was still nominally neutral. The Ferrying Command's sole duty was flying Lend-Lease aircraft from the manufacturers on the West Coast of the US to points in Canada and the East Coast. From there the planes were sent to Britain, either by ship or flown by British pilots. Starting in 1942, the ATC became a worldwide delivery system, carrying cargo and passengers, and flying replacement aircraft, to all theatres. ATC served the material needs of all the services in the war, not just the AAF.Carter, \\"The Air Transport Command,\\" 4‚Äì7. Notably, ATC operated the North Atlantic ferry route,Fuller, Thor's Legion, 55. and the reassignment was in line with their preference for unified commands.Bates, America's Weather Warriors, 1814‚Äì1985, 300.Operational control of the 30th WRS remained with the 8th Weather Squadron. Hosmer was replaced by Maj. Karl T. Rauk in August 1944 and the squadron redesignated the 1st Weather Reconnaissance Squadron. In September, the squadron headquarters moved to Grenier Field near Manchester, New Hampshire. With the failure of the last German offensive at the Battle of the Bulge in early 1945, German forces were fatally damaged and the effects were felt on the ferry routes to the European Theater. The monthly averages for aircraft arriving in Europe fell from 1551 in 1944 to 681 in 1945.Army Air Forces Statistical Digest: World War II, 183. With the end of the war in sight, the squadron was reorganized in February. Rauk was promoted to Lt. Col. and assigned command of the 3d Reconnaissance Squadron, Weather, Heavy(3d RS).Markus, Air Weather Service, 140, 142. The 3d also received the 1st Squadron's RB-17 flight and its mission.Fuller, Thor's Legions, 238. Rauk was replaced by Capt. Sidney C. Bruce and the 1st Squadron was reassigned to the 311th Photographic Wing, Mapping and Charting. By September, the squadron was operating only a single flight. The squadron was inactivated in December.  Equipment  = Aircraft = 1st WRS TB-25#43-36089 When interest in the AAF Weather Reconnaissance (Test) Number One renewed in spring of 1943, it was assigned a single Lockheed Hudson. Originally, in August 1943, it was intended to equip it with six Consolidated B-24 Liberators but heavy demands for combat aircraft kept the squadron unsupplied and unattended until March 1943.The Hudson was unsuitable and would soon be unobtainable since Lockheed was stopping production. A modified version of the North American B-25 Mitchell was chosen instead. The armaments were removed, eliminating the weight from the guns, turrets, armor plating and bombsight. In their place, additional fuel tanks were installed in the bomb bay. This modification was later redesignated the TB-25D. The crew complement was pilot, co-pilot, navigator, weather officer, radio operator and flight engineer.Tannehill, The Hurricane Hunters, 132‚Äì149. 1st WRS RB-17E \\"The Green Banana\\" & Crew ‚Äì 9 June 1944 The squadron received an initial nine TB-25Ds, in May 1943, and two more TB-25Ds in the next year. In August 1944, the squadron received nine B-25Js with the same modifications. The D models had a top speed of 284 mph at 15,000 feet with a range of 1,500 miles. The J models had a top speed of 272 mph at 13,000 feet with a range of 1,350 miles. When the squadron was given three Boeing B-17Es for winter operations in 1943‚Äì1944, the crews that went to pick them up in Spokane, Washington in December, found that the airplanes had 1941 serial numbers and had already flown many hours over the Aleutians. It took weeks of maintenance before they were ready for missions in February 1944. The airplanes were stripped of armament and armor and had additional fuel tanks in the bomb bays. They were designated RB-17Es, with a crew complement of pilot, co-pilot, navigator, weather officer, radio operator and flight engineer. Over the next year, the squadron received two additional airplanes, an RB-17F and an RB-17G. The RB-17Fs and RB-17Gs and their crews were on detached service from Air Transport Command; only the weather officers were members of the squadron. = Instruments = The TB-25s were outfitted with: ML-313/AM psychrometer, ML-175-T-1 psychrometer, Friez Aerograph, SCR-718A radio altimeter, Kollsman pressure altimeter, C-13A free air thermometer, cloud height meter. The RB-17s were outfitted with: ML-313/AM psychrometer, Friez or Pioneer Aerograph ML-715, SCR-518 or SCR-718 Radio Altimeter, K-20 camera for cloud photography, cloud height meter, weather observer's table, de-icing equipment. 1st WRS RB-17G Weather Instruments 1st WRS RB-17G Weather Instruments The psychrometers were a wet bulb-dry bulb pair of thermometers. The moisture evaporating from the wet fabric on one bulb cooled it, the lower the humidity the lower the temperature. By comparing the two temperatures, it was possible to calculate the relative humidity. The thermometers were inside the nose of the airplane. Air was trapped by probes attached to the outside and directed in over the thermometer bulbs. When the psychrometer was first tried in the airplanes, the readings were inaccurate. It was found that when exposed to an airstream moving over 200 mph, the friction of the air heated the thermometers. The amount of heating was unpredictable, making it impossible to calculate a correction. New psychrometers were developed that slowed the air before making the readings. With these devices, accuracy was 98‚Äì99%.Rand, \\"Atlantic Weather Report(Patrol),\\" 32, 140. The aerograph combined three instruments, an air pressure sensor, a humidity sensor and a temperature sensor. The sensors were connected to pens that drew graphs on a paper chart wrapped around a rotating drum. The paper chart was replaced with a new one when it was full. When all the charts from a mission were collected in the mission log, they provided a continuous record of conditions of the flight. The air pressure sensor was an aneroid barometer and the humidity sensor was strands of human hair. As the hair absorbed or evaporated moisture, it lengthened or shortened, moving the pen.Rand, \\"Atlantic Weather Report(Patrol),\\" 32.Harvard, \\"Friez Model 712 Aerograph.\\" The radio altimeter gave a true reading of the airplane's altitude when it was over the sea. Over land, the radio altimeter only gave the altitude over the land below. Without knowing the elevation of the land, it wasn't possible to know the true altitude. The pressure altimeter gave the same readings over land or sea, but it could not distinguish between a change in air pressure caused by a change in altitude and a change in air pressure caused by a change in barometric pressure. Therefore, the pressure altimeter was only accurate to a range of altitudes. By using both altimeters together over the ocean, it was possible to determine the true altitude, the true air pressure at that altitude and the pressure at other altitudes at that point.Rand, \\"Atlantic Weather Report(Patrol),\\" 140. On some RB-17E missions, there was also a bucket in the event the weather officer got airsick.Personal recollections of 1st Lt. Walter F. Wisnieski, Weather Officer, 1st WRS, 1943‚Äì1945.  Observations  1st WRS Mission Briefing All the effort of the officers and men of the squadron had one goal, to place the necessary instruments and a trained observer in the air at the right place and time. The success of any mission depended on the reliability of the readings they made. The instruments used were typically what any weather observer would have used at the time, modified where needed to adapt to the special circumstances of flight. In particular, they were designed to give readings from the air outside the airplane, not inside.Rand, \\"Atlantic Weather Report(Patrol),\\" 32, 140, 144. In all types of aircraft used, the weather officer sat in the nose where the bombardier would be in a combat airplane. The glazing gave good views of the sky, and, when flying at low, the sea. The weather officer's task was to observe and record both the visible conditions outside the airplane and the indications on the instruments. The psychrometer and aerograph indicated the relative humidity. The free air thermometer and aerograph gave the air temperature. The radio altimeter gave the altitude, and the pressure altimeter and aerograph gave the air pressure. By using both altimeters, the weather officer determined and recorded the air pressure at standard altitudes, such as 5,000 and 10,000 feet. Wind speed and direction were determined from the aircraft's drift off course. By watching for sharp changes in temperature and humidity on the aerograph chart, the weather officer noted the strength and locations of cold fronts. By having the airplane fly along a constant pressure altitude, the weather officer could map an isobaric surface. Looking outside, he observed the height, amount and type of clouds and could photograph significant formations. He could also observe the amount and duration of any icing. At low altitudes, he could estimate the wind speed and direction if its effect on the ocean's surface was strong enough. All these observations were logged and periodically radioed to the weather reporting network. At the end of the mission, the weather officer submitted his log to the 8th Weather Squadron forecasters for analysis.  Operations  While the squadron's headquarters were in the northeastern US, it operated throughout the North Atlantic region. It had headquarters first at Presque Isle, Maine, and then Grenier Field in New Hampshire. Reconnaissance flights were staged out of: Gander Airport, Newfoundland; Goose Bay, Labrador; Bluie West 1, Greenland; Meeks Field, Iceland; Stornoway in the Hebrides, Scotland; Kindley Field; Bermuda; Lajes Field, Azores; Atkinson Field, British Guiana; Morrison Field, Florida; Borinquen Field, Puerto Rico;Tannehill, The Hurricane Hunters, 134. Waller Field, Trinidad; and Belem Airport, Brazil.Fuller, Thor's Legions, 64. During its 31 months of operations, it performed four different missions; area synoptic reconnaissance, route reconnaissance, vertical soundings and hurricane reconnaissance.White, \\"Hurricane Hunters Blazed Bright Path,\\" 22. 1st WRS TB-25 Maintenance The first missions in 1943 were route reconnaissance flown by TB-25Ds.Rand, \\"Atlantic Weather Report (Patrol),\\" 31. The planes scouted ahead of a planned flight of aircraft across a short hop route, reporting the weather along the way by Morse code. At the end of the reconnaissance the weather officer also sent a report describing the types of aircraft that could cross safely. Because weather reports were vital information that the Germans could intercept, they were encrypted before they were sent.Jonasson, \\"The AAF Weather Service,\\" 337.Bates, America's Weather Warriors, 65. Under Clark Hosmer the squadron's initial nine TB-25Ds were divided into three flights of three airplanes. Each flight was assigned one leg of the route. The first leg was between Labrador and Greenland, a second between Greenland and Iceland, and a third between Iceland and Scotland. Each were 700 to 800 miles. In the first six months of Hosmer's command, the squadron flew 446 missions and no planes were lost to weather on flights scouted by the squadron. This achievement earned medals for the commander and his crews. By December the North Atlantic weather was too dangerous for twin engine B-25s to fly in safely and six planes were sent to the 9th Weather Region to fly reconnaissance for the South Atlantic ferry route. Two airplanes each went to: Morrison Field, Flight C; Trinidad, Flight D; and Brazil, Flight E. Their missions were primarily route reconnaissance at first, shifting to more synoptic missions towards the end of their assignments. They returned north in May 1944. Route reconnaissance was very good for short term forecasts over one route, but wasn‚Äôt very efficient, so early in 1944 the squadron began emphasizing synoptic area reconnaissance. Since weather moves from west to east over the North Atlantic, it was possible to make useful forecasts for all the routes by taking readings over a large area from Newfoundland and Labrador to Greenland.Rand, \\"Atlantic Weather Report (Patrol),\\" 32. In December 1943, the squadron received a flight of three B-17s on detached service from ATC. These heavier aircraft with four engines were better able to handle the rough winter weather. When they started flying in February 1944, they flew a synoptic track out and back from either Goose Bay or Gander Field. This was at first designated Flight B, later as Falcon Flight. On a typical mission, the airplane started at 0730GMT from Gander and flew a round trip of 1400 nautical miles. On the outbound segment, the airplane flew 700 nautical miles at 10,000 feet and returned inbound at 500 feet. During the flight, the weather officer periodically recorded the altitude, temperature, air pressure, relative humidity and the wind speed and direction. He also recorded the amount and duration of any icing, the strength and location of any cold fronts and the amount, type and height of any clouds.Rand, \\"Atlantic Weather Report (Patrol),\\" 140, 144. The readings were reported every 100 miles by radio. These missions continued until February 1945. Meanwhile, the three B-25s that were left behind at Presque Isle in December 1943 were organized into Flight A and flew a few missions that winter between Presque Isle, Goose Bay and Gander Field. In March 1944, the squadron instituted a synoptic flight, named Eagle, from Lajes Field in the Azores. Two B-25s flew a daily 1200-mile track. In May, Eagle Flight assisted the Navy moving six blimps from Massachusetts to French Morocco. Eagle Flight continued until August 1945. In May 1944, the B-25s returned from the 9th Weather Region and resumed reconnaissance in the North Atlantic. Three new routes were set, named Redbird, Bluebird and Blackbird: Redbird initially between Goose Bay and BW1 then between Goose Bay and Presque Isle; Bluebird between Bluie West 1 and Meeks Field; Blackbird between Meeks Field and Stornoway. Most of the missions were route reconnaissance but shifted towards more synoptic missions through the summer. Starting in July, there was an additional out and back synoptic track named Raven flown south of Iceland from Meeks Field. In the winter, the squadron again sent three flights of airplanes south, to Lajes Field, Kindley Field in Bermuda, and Atkinson Field, British Guiana. Eagle Flight at Lajes got an additional four to six planes, depending on the month. The operations out of Kindley were named Robin Flight. Eagle and Robin Flights continued until they were inactivated in August 1945. The operations out of Atkinson were named Duck Flight. In May 1945, Duck flight moved to Morrison Field, Florida, where it replaced the Hurricane Reconnaissance Unit that had flown for the 1944 hurricane season. Duck Flight flew routine reconnaissance throughout the summer, looking for hurricanes to the east, and south to Antigua, BVI.Tannehill, The Hurricane Hunters, 133.White, \\"Hurricane Hunters Blazed Bright Path,\\" 21‚Äì22.At that time, Duck Flight had five aircraft and flew twice a day. On 12 September, they found one of the most violent ones ever recorded, Kappler's Hurricane.Tannehill, The Hurricane Hunters, 132. The developing hurricane was spotted by weather officer 2nd Lt. Bernard J. Kappler while on a routine mission. With little difficulty, Kappler's B-25 flew through the storm that was already close to hurricane strength. They flew on to Antigua for the night with orders to return to the storm in the morning. The next day was more troublesome. Kappler's airplane encountered winds up to 120 knots, severe turbulence and heavy rain before penetrating the eye. The storm was estimated at 200 miles across. Damage on the ground was extensive but no air crew were lost. Automated recordings made as the storm passed over Morrison Field showed the highest sustained wind at 170 mph with a gust to 198 mph. In the period June through November 1945, Duck Flight flew into six tropical storms, two hurricanes and completed 258 synoptic missions for a total of 1145 hours of operation. Duck Flight moved back to Grenier Field that December and was inactivated.Fuller, Thor's Legions, 239.Elements of the 53d Reconnaissance Squadron, Very Long Range, Weather took over hurricane reconnaissance the next season. On 21 December, the 1st Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, Air Route, Medium, was inactivated at Grenier Field, New Hampshire.

The film depicts a captive man named James who is rescued from an underground bunker where he obsessed over a children's television program titled Brigsby Bear Adventures. When he realizes the show was created by his captor, his fascination leads him to finish the storyline himself. Mooney and Kevin Costello co-wrote the screenplay with a story by Mooney. The film was inspired by McCary, Mooney, and Costello's middle school experiences making short films together, with a story stemming from Mooney's fascination with 1980s children's shows. Principal photography took place in Utah during Mooney and McCary's break from working on Saturday Night Live. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 23, 2017, and was released on July 28, 2017, by Sony Pictures Classics. Brigsby Bear received positive reviews from critics, who praised the script, direction, cast and art design; critics also commended the film's sentimental tone. Plot James (Kyle Mooney) lives in an underground bunker home with his parents Ted and April Mitchum (Mark Hamill and Jane Adams), whom he is forced to stay underground with. Ted tells James that the outside world is dangerous to them and James often watches him leave the bunker with a gas mask on. James is fascinated with an educational children's show titled Brigsby Bear because he owns every episode on VHS Tape and fills his room with memorabilia. One night, he sneaks out only to see several police cars approach the home. The police raid the bunker and James is taken away from Ted and April who are arrested. James is brought to the police station and meets Detective Vogel (Greg Kinnear) who tells James that Ted and April are not his real parents, and that he has been held captive since he was a baby. He also informs James that Brigsby Bear is not real and was made by Ted, a former artist and designer who disappeared with his wife in 1987. Vogel explains that they tracked Ted from the studio where the show was made. Then Vogel introduces James to his real parents, Greg and Louise Pope (Matt Walsh and Michaela Watkins), and their teenage daughter Aubrey (Ryan Simpkins). Though they try introducing James to his new life, he can't stop thinking about Brigsby Bear. One night, Aubrey takes James to a party. He meets Aubrey's friend Spencer (Jorge Lendeborg Jr.) and later starts talking about Brigsby Bear to his new friends. This prompts him to come up with the idea to make a movie based on the character to close the series after looking up information on how to make a movie. He starts production after Detective Vogel, who sympathizes with James through Vogel's own early acting dreams, lends James some props from the show, and Spencer, being a filmmaker, agrees to make the movie with him. Spencer also advertises the movie by uploading episodes of Brigsby Bear to YouTube, where it gains popularity and a new audience. Greg and Louise do not approve of James' activities because they fear it hinders his chances of living a normal life. While filming in a forest, James uses an explosive he made for a scene that detonates, surprising Spencer. The group is arrested, but James takes the blame for it. The police release him, but confiscate the Brigsby Bear props once again. James takes his parents' car out one night to steal the costumes and props. He takes a detour first to his old underground home, now abandoned and cordoned off with yellow tape. James stops by a diner and discovers Whitney (Kate Lyn Sheil), the actress who played both Arielle and Nina Smiles in the show. She tells him that she never knew the true circumstances behind the side acting job, having been told by Ted Mitchum that it was for Canadian public access. As the police arrive outside, James asks Whitney to reprise her role for his film and admits that he had a longtime crush on her through the show. James is placed in a mental institution. Meanwhile, Aubrey shows her parents parts of the movie, where the two realize that making the movie allowed him to spend time with his friends. One night, James breaks out of the institution to grab his belongings, but discovers his family, along with Spencer and Detective Vogel, building a Brigsby Bear set in their garage. They tell him that after they saw how happy he was behind the scenes, they agree to help out as well. James later visits Ted in jail who apologizes for abducting him. James actually tells Ted about the movie and states that they are having trouble getting the voices right. Ted helps him out by recording the voice-overs for Brigsby and the other characters. James finishes the movie, with Detective Vogel playing the character Feldo Mortese and Whitney as the Smiles Sisters. On premiere night, the show is sold out and James is worried no one will like it, so he stays out of the theatre while the movie plays. When James walks into the theater, he is met with a standing ovation. James is happy that the film is a success. He looks over to the stage and sees Brigsby wave goodbye and disappear. Cast * Kyle Mooney as James Pope, a man who was raised in a bunker and grew up watching Brigsby Bear. * Claire Danes as Emily * Mark Hamill as Ted Mitchum, an artist and designer who abducted James when he was young, raised him as one of his own and created Brigsby Bear. In addition, Ted was the one who provided the voices of Brigsby Bear and the Sun Snatcher when making the show for James. * Greg Kinnear as Detective Vogel, a detective who finds James and later portrays Feldo Mortese in the Brigsby Bear movie. * Andy Samberg as Eric * Matt Walsh as Greg Pope, the biological father of James. * Michaela Watkins as Louise Pope, the biological mother of James. * Ryan Simpkins as Aubrey Pope, the sister of James. * Jorge Lendeborg Jr. as Spencer, a filmmaker and friend of Aubrey who befriends James while helping to make the Brigsby Bear movie. * Beck Bennett as Deputy Bander * Alexa Demie as Merideth * Chance Crimin as Logan * Kate Lyn Sheil as Whitney, an actress who portrayed \\"Arielle and Nina Smiles\\" on Brigsby Bear. ** Kiera Milan Hendricks as Young Smiles Sisters * Jane Adams as April Mitchum, the wife of Ted who raised James as one of her own. * Tim Heidecker as Coach Brad * Nick Rutherford as Excited Man Production Brigsby Bear was co-written by Kyle Mooney and Kevin Costello, and directed by Dave McCary. All three grew up in San Diego, California and attended middle school together. Mooney and McCary, alongside Beck Bennett and Nick Rutherford, later formed the sketch group Good Neighbor, and all joined the cast and crew of Saturday Night Live (SNL) in 2013‚Äì14. Mooney and Costello wrote the film over a two to three-year period. Much of the character of James comes from Mooney's personal life, which he considered obsessive, sometimes awkward, and always nostalgic. Whenever Costello and Mooney could write together, they would write fast and messy, with Costello polishing it while Mooney worked at SNL. Mooney was fascinated by children's television shows from the 1980s, which he felt combined \\"happy- go-lucky and positive meets the creepy, weird, and psychedelic.\\" He and McCary both singled out Prayer Bear as a primary inspiration. Mooney collects VHS tapes from garage sales, which also fueled the movie's aesthetic. Their pedigree at SNL allowed them to cast their film with big names like Mark Hamill, who plays Ted. McCary likened Ted's character to a depraved Jim Henson, \\"teaching weird lessons about the world in a loving way.\\" He noted he and Costello both grew up in strict, Christian households, which colored the way they depicted the character. They hoped to have viewers intrigued by the retro nature of the bunker, which they infused with a \\"low-rent Splash Mountain\\" feel. McCary was largely responsible for the film's earnest and sometimes melancholy tone, which he felt serviced James's emotional journey in the film. For McCary, he had always hoped to direct something dramatic, as opposed to his more comedic material in the past. Part of James's journey in the film, including his fear that people will not enjoy his film, came from a genuine place for the filmmakers. In addition, when making the film, the filmmakers discovered that in many ways, they were documenting their friendship of creating videos together. The film was shot in mid-2016 in Utah during Mooney and McCary's break from SNL. The Utah Film Commission put out a press release in June 2016 announcing that six films had been granted incentives to film in the state, including Brigsby Bear. They shot the film with a small, close-knit group and likened the experience to summer camp. After shooting the film, McCary had to complete editing while still working at SNL. Release Brigsby Bear at the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con The film premiered at the Eccles Theatre at the Sundance Film Festival on January 23, 2017. Shortly after, Sony Pictures Classics acquired distribution rights to the film for $5 million, which was far higher than the film's budget. The team behind the film were very happy working with Sony Pictures Classics, noting that they wanted no edits made to the film and were on the same page regarding keeping the film's plot line a secret in marketing. The film's formal premiere was in New York on July 26, 2017 and began its theatrical run on July 28, 2017. The film was released on DVD, Blu-Ray and Digital Download on November 14, 2017. Reception Critical response On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 82% based on 157 reviews, with an average rating of 6.79/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Audiences attuned to Brigsby Bears strange frequency will be moved by its earnest ‚Äì and endearingly original ‚Äì approach to pop culture's impact and the creative urge.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 68 out of 100, based on 35 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Manohla Dargis from The New York Times summarized it as a \\"sweet and sometimes delightful melancholic story of a lonely man saved by imagination and love. That sounds like a bushel of cornball and might have devolved into pure ick if the director, Dave McCary, didn‚Äôt lead from the heart and wasn‚Äôt adept at navigating seemingly clashing tones.\\" John DeFore at The Hollywood Reporter found it to be \\"a charming, surprisingly underplayed paean to pop-culture obsession.\\" Geoff Berkshire of Variety praised every aspect of the film from its cast to script, but singled out \\"the art department and designers involved in creating both the world of the Brigsby show and the underground bunker where James grew up.\\" Vulture's Emily Yoshida analyzed it as \\"asking much trickier questions than it would ever let on about the coddling effect of media and geek obsession, and the purging effect of storytelling.\\" Stephanie Merry from The Washington Post perceived the film's genuine tone as fresh: \\"[The film] never ventures into the caustic simply for the sake of comedy. These days, that‚Äôs refreshing. There aren‚Äôt many movies that value sweetness over cynicism.\\" Conversely, David Sims of The Atlantic felt the movie ends up too \\"blandly optimistic,\\" but felt it would not work another way: \\"It‚Äôs hard to fault Mooney and Costello for choosing the sweeter path‚Äîthe movie is, after all, told through James‚Äôs eyes, and he has only the dimmest awareness of the wrongs that have been done to him over the years.\\" The Boston Globe Tom Russo surmised \\"the [sincere] approach can be a reach, but on the whole it works better than you might guess.\\" Entertainment Weekly Chris Nashawaty considered it a \\"slight, handcrafted indie that‚Äôs sweet, skewed, and feels a bit like a skit stretched out to feature length.\\" David Ehrlich at IndieWire felt it veered into formula, concluding, \\"While too silly and open hearted to hate, Brigsby Bear begins with a premise that‚Äôs weird enough to be good, but settles for a weak trajectory that isn‚Äôt good enough to be weird.\\" A.A. Dowd at The A.V. Club felt it could have been a \\"soulful fairy tale,\\" but ended up \\"a quirky sitcom recovery fable about transforming our childhoods through art to overcome them.\\" Leslie Felperin, writing for The Guardian, deemed it \\"overly whimsical,\\" but also \\"likable enough, even if it contains precious few belly laughs.\\" See also * Stockholm syndrome References External links 2017 films English-language films American films American comedy films 2017 comedy films Films about kidnapping Films about filmmaking Films shot in Utah Films shot in Salt Lake City Sony Pictures Classics films Films produced by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller Films about film directors and producers 2017 directorial debut films ","title":"Brigsby Bear"},{"id":"52898103","text":"Aditi Keshavdev Sharma (born 5 August 1996 at Jhansi) is an Uttar Pradeshi First-class cricket cricketer.Player's profile at EspncricinfoPlayer's profile at Cricketarchive She plays for Uttar Pradesh and Central Zone.

Roderick Ferguson is credited with coining this term in his 2004 book Aberrations in Black, and draws from woman of color feminism, postcolonial studies, queer theory and African American studies.Valles- Morales, Jesus. \\"On Queer of Color Criticism, Communication Studies, and Corporeality. Kaleidoscope: A Graduate Journal of Qualitative Communication Research 14 (2015) In his critique of canonical sociology, Ferguson argues that racialized heteronormativity and heteropatriarchy have played a conspicuous role in shaping sociology and social policy, and recognizes its intersection with revolutionary nationalism.Albertine, Susan. \\"Aberrations in Black: Toward a Queer of Color Critique (Book Review).\\" American Literature 77.3 (2005). Queer of color critique operates as a method for building unlikely coalitions across different identity categories. In framing queer of color critique, Ferguson draws from Barbara Smith and the Combahee River Collective's use of coalitional politics to address gender, race, and sexuality in context with capitalist expansion.  Influences  Queer of color critique has been taken up by multiple scholars as an attempt at a more intersectional framework on which to build and extend their work in various, sometimes intersecting academic subjects.Mu√±oz, Jos√©¬Å Esteban. Disidentifications: Queers of Color and the Performance of Politics. Minneapolis: U of Minnesota, 2015. Print.  Queerness and indigeneity  Though most references at the intersection of queerness and indigeneity fall on Two-Spirit identity and ideas surrounding it, queer of color critique extends the discussion to settler colonialism, future potentialities of Native identity and life, and general discourse about how Native Studies as an academic study can benefit from a sort of \\"queering\\". According to scholar Andrea Smith, looking at indigeneity from this perspective questions the limitations of a \\"subjectless\\" or \\"postidentity\\" analysis in regards to the shedding of a particular ethnic identity, which in itself has roots in colonialist and nationalist ideology. On the other hand, even this sort of critique does not fully acknowledge the extent of the absence of indigeneity in the context of direct and indirect investment in settler colonialism by those of color doing the critiquing.Smith, Andrea. \\"Queer Theory and Native Studies: The Heteronormativity of Settler Colonialism.\\" GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies 16.1‚Äì2 (2010): 41‚Äì68. Web.Morgensen, Scott Lauria. Spaces between Us: Queer Settler Colonialism and Indigenous Decolonization. Minneapolis: U of Minnesota, 2011. Print.  De-colonial studies  The unraveling of colonialist ideology,‚Äîthe belief in a normative society‚Äîaccording to scholar Emma Perez, is necessary to fully understand national histories and identities, specifically of queer individuals. The first anthology to explicitly connect decoloniality to queerness appeared in 2016 titled Decolonizing Sexualities: Transnational Perspectives, Critical Interventions.Sandeep Bakshi, Suhraiya Jivraj and Silvia Posocco Eds. (2016), Decolonizing Sexualities: Transnational Perspectives, Critical Interventions (Oxford: Counterpress). https://counterpress.org.uk/publications/decolonizing- sexualities/  Queer diasporic critique  Queer diasporic critique can be considered an extension of and complement to queer of color critique in that it considers ethnic and cultural identity as an underlying context when analyzing and critiquing arguments based on Eurocentric, white centered queer theories, as well as critiquing the heteronormativity of area studies. Oftentimes, these ideas are connected to ideas of nationhood and national identity.Lesk, Andrew. \\"Queerly Canadian: An Introductory Reader in Sexuality Studies Ed. by Maureen FitzGerald and Scott Rayter (review).\\" University of Toronto Quarterly. University of Toronto Press, 28 Oct. 2015. Web. 29 Apr. 2017. In this respect, critique emphasizing diaspora tends to focus more on a \\"global restructuring of capital and its attendant gender and sexual hierarchies\\" and the creation of \\"home\\" in regards to diaspora and transnationalism.Gopinath, Gayatri. \\"Bollywood Spectacles: Queer Diasporic Critique in the Aftermath of 9/11.\\" Social Text 23.3‚Äì4 84‚Äì85 (2005): 157‚Äì69. Web. = Queer Muslims = An example of queer of color critique in practice can be seen in the analysis of queer Muslims in Europe done by scholar Fatima El-Tayeb, which touches on the larger themes explored in queer theory. Among these is the idea of \\"coming-out\\" as a person of diaspora, which challenges the currently held notion of its role in the creation of a \\"normative, healthy and desirable LGBT identity\\". Another describes how the idea of Islamophobia permeates into the intersectional oppressions faced by queer Muslims in the west. The ideas of migration and \\"home\\" are also critiqued in that the ethnic migrant laborer lives amongst an \\"increasingly segregated, criminalized and policed multi-ethnic population of color\\". These queer diasporic and queer of color critiques therefore act as a lens through which to view homonormativity and the various facets through which is functions.El-Tayeb, F. \\"'Gays Who Cannot Properly Be Gay': Queer Muslims in the Neoliberal European City.\\" European Journal of Women's Studies 19.1 (2012): 79‚Äì95. Web.Puar, Jasbir K. Terrorist Assemblages: Homonationalism in Queer times. Durham, NC: Duke UP, 2008. Print. As a type of community manifestation of this type of critique, the queer of color activist group Strange Fruit: A Dutch Queer Collective takes an intersectional, colored approach to queer activism. This helps undermine binaries such as the \\"Muslim/European dichotomy to the normative coming out narrative\\", which, according to El-Tayeb, perpetuate homonormativity and racism.  Scholarship  Some notable scholars who have incorporated queer of color critique into their work are Roderick Ferguson, Jesus Values-Morales, Andrea Smith, Gayatri Gopinath, Fatima El-Tayeb, Martin Manalansan IV, Juana Mar√≠a Rodr√≠guez, Jos√© Esteban Mu√±oz, Emma Perez, Edward Brockenbrough, Salvador Vidal-Ortiz, Amy Villarejo, Jasbir Puar, Scott Lauria Morgensen, Kevin K.

She has released four studio albums through Cameron House Records and Six Shooter Records. Her self-titled debut album Whitney Rose was released in 2012 and Heartbreaker of the Year in 2015. The EP South Texas Suite was released in 2017. Rule 62 was released in October 2017. Rose currently resides in Austin, Texas.  History  Whitney Rebecca Rose was raised by her mother Laurie Rose and her grandparents, Jean (n√©e Dunn) and John P. Rose (1947‚Äì2015), in Charlottetown, the capital of Prince Edward Island, where she lived in a home with her mother's younger brothers and sisters. Her grandparents ran a bar called the Union Hall. Rose's favorite song from the age of two was Hank Williams‚Äô \\"There's a Tear in My Beer\\", which she'd sing to bar customers ‚Äì sometimes crawling downstairs after her bedtime, and sometimes being paid a dollar to sing. As she jokes, \\"I guess it became my career pretty early on. And the pay is about the same now, too. Not much has changed.\\" Her grandfather's \\"song of choice\\" was the Johnny Cash classic \\"Ring of Fire\\", which she often includes in her set lists in his memory. As an 8-year-old, Rose made a road trip with her mother to Halifax, Nova Scotia where she saw The Rankin Family, a regional group that mixed Celtic and country sounds. It was her first big concert. She plays the group's music on the tour bus \\"because nobody really outside of the (Canadian) East Coast has even heard of them. . . I don't think it's solely nostalgia. I actually enjoy the music, too.\\" Rose attended five different colleges, studying journalism and majoring in English. A \\"starter guitar\\" given to her by her Uncle Dan started her writing songs. Moving to Toronto from \\"a farm in the middle of nowhere in Nova Scotia\\", and a failed relationship, she'd written enough songs for a record. In Toronto she got \\"immersed\\" in the Cameron House scene, the bar becoming a second home. She released her self-titled debut record in 2012 for fledgling Cameron House Records. She got signed by \\"great booking agents\\" in 2013 and made a \\"one-off appearance\\" opening for U.S. country act The Mavericks in Toronto. She later toured as an opening act for Raul Malo‚Äôs band. Rose received a Gibson acoustic guitar, which she named \\"Aggie\\", as a 27th- birthday present from a boyfriend in 2013. Rose says of the instrument, \\"I always kind of meant it to be just a writing tool. ... It's kind of one of the biggest surprises of my life that I actually play guitar in front of people night after night because at one point it would have been absolutely my worst nightmare.\\" She signed with Six Shooter Records in 2016 and is managed by Michael McKeown, former president of Cameron House Records. Recordings Rose at NXNE in 2014 Rose signed originally with Cameron House Records, an \\"offshoot of the legendary Toronto club\\" of the same name. She joined other artists on the label, e.g., Al Tuck, Doug Paisley, The Devin Cuddy Band, Sam Cash & The Romantic Dogs.  Heartbreaker of the Year (2015)  Rose's sophomore release was produced by The Mavericks' frontman, Raul Malo, and includes two covers: Hank Williams‚Äô \\"There's a Tear in My Beer\\" and \\"Be My Baby\\" by the Ronettes. Rose and Malo have often sung the Nancy and Frank Sinatra duet \\"Somethin‚Äô Stupid\\" together onstage. American Songwriter says: \\"There‚Äôs a robust countrypolitan vibe to much of this, that hits its peak on the string enhanced ballad ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt it Wise,‚Äù with Malo on backing vocals, sounding like a hit from the mid-‚Äô60s. Rose sings in a sweet, strong, vulnerable voice that‚Äôs both powerful and subtle, a tricky balance she pulls off with a smooth and soulful edge.\\" They note: ‚ÄúThe Devil Borrowed My Boots‚Äù is \\"terrifically crafted and brilliantly realized roots music guaranteed to provoke smiles.\\" Rolling Stone says on this release that Rose \\"playfully croons through tales of love and mischief with girlish breath and devilish twang.\\"  South Texas Suite (2017)  Interstellar Rodeo 2017 The EP South Texas Suite was released on January 27, 2017 by both Six Shooter Records and Thirty Tigers. Recorded at Dale Watson's Ameripolitan Studios in Austin, it is considered \\"Canadian countrypolitan chanteuse\\" Rose's love letter to the Texas capitol, her adopted home following a \\"winter engagement\\" at famed Continental Club.

Plot Schoolboy Alik Rainbow lives in a creative family (his father is a musician and composer, mother is a choreographer) which has made him a dreamer and a poet. Studying is very easy for Alik, but there is one problem: Rainbow is not able to jump high, and therefore is among the worst in gym class. In his fantasies Alik floats on the table like a gondola on the sea and communicates with the Siren, who suddenly offers Rainbow to fulfill his innermost desire. Without hesitating, Alik asks to be gifted with the ability to jump up at any height. Siren performs the boy's request, but stipulates one condition: if Rainbow ever tells a single lie, the gift will disappear immediately! Endowed with the magic force Alik becomes a hit in gym class. The overwhelmed teacher immediately sends Rainbow to the athletics sports team. But wanting to bail out a girl whom Alik loves, Rainbow lies, the gift disappears and now Alik can not even jump through a straw ... The situation could be remedied by using the help of Ivan Ivanovich. This is the legendary Ivan the Fool, whom the evil witch turned into a stump. During his walks, Alik finds this stump, carves a wooden figure from it, and thus revives Ivan Ivanovich. They have a lot of fun talking and Ivan Ivanovich constantly offers to help Rainbow. But Alik decides to reach the heights of sport by himself, with the help of tedious training rather than magical power ...

Plot The film is set in France, at the beginning of the 19th century. After military defeat, Emperor Napoleon abdicates and is in exile on the island of Elba. As requested by the dying Captain, his assistant Edmond Dant√®s approaches the island and takes with him a certain letter which he has to deliver in Paris. Dant√®s is very young but his life is already full of happiness. The shipowner appoints Edmond as captain and in Marseille, the beautiful bride Mercedes waits for Dant√®s. But the deep-seated jealousy of Edmond's enemies destroys everything... On the advice of Danglar, a close friend of Dant√®s, the fisherman Fernand who is passionately in love with Mercedes writes a denunciation to the prosecutor of Marseilles and by the order of assistant prosecutor de Villefort hapless Dant√®s becomes imprisoned in the most horrible dungeon Ch√¢teau d'If. Dant√®s, not understanding what has happened, almost goes mad in the gloomy prison but by chance he meets Abb√© Faria, a wise and resilient old man. Abb√© tries to dig a hole to freedom in his cell but instead ends up in Edmond's cell. Faria decides to share with Dant√®s all of his knowledge and experience, as well as the countless treasures that are hidden on the island of Monte Cristo. Years pass and Edmond Dant√®s is reborn, becoming the most intelligent and educated person. Taking advantage of the death of Abb√© Faria, Edmond manages to escape from the Ch√¢teau d'If. Dant√®s finds the treasure, \\"buries\\" his name forever and becomes the Count of Monte Cristo. Over the period of many years that Dant√®s spent in prison the lives of his enemies have changed radically. Petty officer Danglar has become the Baron, one of the richest bankers in France. De Villefort was appointed as king's attorney, and the simple fisherman Fernand has become a Count, General, Lord of France and - the most important for him - Mercedes's husband. Power and money - all this is now in the hands of scoundrels making them almost invulnerable, but the Count of Monte Cristo is full of lust for revenge. He begins to investigate thoroughly the lives of his enemies, and soon discovers the terrible and bloody secrets they contain. And if Monte Cristo publicly reveals these mysteries he can severely punish his enemies...

It recorded data on an 8\\" diskette, a new recording medium from IBM, for fast, flexible, efficient data entry to either high-production, centralized operations or to decentralized, remote operations.\\"I.B.M. Introduces Machine To Enter Data Into Computer,\\" NY Times, Jan 23, 1973 The \\"Diskette\\" was more commonly known as an 8-inch floppy disk. History The system was announced in January, 1973; became available in the second quarter of that year; and was withdrawn from marketing in December, 1983. It was developed by IBM's General Systems Division facility in Rochester, Minnesota. The IBM 3740 system was intended to replace the traditional unit record equipment, using the IBM card. Configuration The IBM 3740 system consisted of the following equipment:IBM 3740 System With Flexible Diskette (IEEE Computer Society) * IBM 3741 Data Station (four models) * IBM 3742 Dual Data Station (designed for 'heads-down' data entry) * IBM 3747 Data Converter (diskette feeder which holds up to 20 diskettes to be converted to the half- inch tape used by the computing system (main frame) or optionally distributed by data network or telephone communications send and receive.) * IBM 3713 Printer (for matrix printing on fan-fold or individually fed cut-sheet paper at up to 40 characters a second) * IBM 3715 Printer (for bi-directional matrix printing on fan-fold or individually fed cut-sheet paper at 40 or 80 characters per second with an option of up to 120 characters per second offered.) * IBM 3717 Printer (a band printer (line printer) which is capable of 120 to 155 lines per minute - very fast) * IBM 3540 Diskette Input/Output Unit (held up to 20 diskettes, for input to/output from mainframe computers such as IBM System/360 or System/370 and mid-range computers such as IBM System/3, IBM System/36 and IBM System/38.) The configuration is the exclusive responsibility of the company employees who have determined which portions of the company will need data distribution products, how many and for which portions of their business environment. Of course, the expense of their decision might play heavily into the final configuration(s) purchased. When configuring the component equipment for the office complex might consist of several data stations with or without printers attached. Some of the larger offices would likely have similar configuration plus a data converter and a larger printer available on one of the work stations. If a large office complex is available and the data handling capability is needed, then a large number of dual data stations could be used along with possibly another data converter and a line printer attached to an IBM 3741 Data Station which is used by the lead person in charge of the operators of the dual work stations. More lead person single stations may be necessary depending on the company and the environment. Equipment The IBM 3740 System was designed to make the station independent of the system for which the data was being collected. The work station could be placed in varied environments to allow on-location data entry according to the needs of the user. The dual work station offered an almost double capacity for locations with heavy data entry requirements. The system offered enhancements to provide interaction with main frame computers as needed, including a Data Converter and an in/out transfer capability with the computer over the data network. In addition local print capability at 40 cps for some of the models of the IBM 3741 as well as options to go up to 80 cps or even 120 cps on these units makes the system even more usable. * IBM 3741 Data Station The IBM 3741 Data Station is a work station which is similar in size to a small office desk - large enough to afford some personal space for the operator, yet small enough to allow many stations in smaller office spaces. The floppy disk drive was conveniently located on the work station and the height of the table is ergonomically determined for the convenience of the operator. The data could be written to the floppy diskette and later transmitted over data cables or telephone to the place where it was ultimately stored or used. Or the data diskettes could be transported physically to the location of its destination. Gone were the noisy key punch machines and drawers of cards to be transported to a reader for input to the computer system. There are four models of the IBM 3741. Some models have the attachment interface to connect to a printer (IBM 3713, IBM 3715, IBM 3717). Models 3 and 4 allowed programming in what was called ACL, which was an assembler-like programming language that could be used to do some simple programming applications. Thus the user also had some ability to affect how the machine responded to the operator's input, including some limited ability for user 'programming' in addition to the prompting. The prompting ability was generally set up in advance for the enterprise, but the operator used the prompts to guide the entry and sets the station's programming according to their preference. * IBM 3742 Dual Data Station The IBM 3742 is a slightly larger desk compared to the IBM 3741. There are two monitors, two keyboards and two drives - the operators sit on opposite sides of the desk on either end. This arrangement allows greater density of operators by nearly a factor of two in larger operations. The functionality and options available for this work station are somewhat limited compared to the IBM 3741. * IBM 3747 Data Converter The IBM 3747 is a central receiver of the various types of media that the IBM 3740 system utilizes - it receives the data over the data cable or from an auto-feeding hopper of 8\\" diskettes and writes the data to the tape deck according to the type of tape drive needed by the user's system, both 7- and 9-track at various speeds. The Data Converter is also capable of the reverse operation, that is, reading from the tape and transmitting over the communication lines to other users. The IBM 3747 is quite large, approximately 4' x 5' x 3.5' high and accessible on the front side for the tape deck and right end for diskette hopper. The electronics are arranged in the more traditional card on board configuration using predominantly TTL ICs and other proprietary IC components. * IBM 3713, IBM 3715 Printer The IBM 3713 and the IBM 3715 printers are matrix printers which are based on the same printing technology and differ only by the speed that is supported by the printer: the IBM 3713 at 40 characters per second and IBM 3715 at 40, 80 or 120 characters per second. The IBM 3715 is also bi-directional in that the subsequent line is printed in the opposite direction from the preceding line so that the printhead is not required to return to one side for each line. The design of the printer case of the IBM 3715 is an integral standalone, so that the printer and its paper input and output handling could be attached to the IBM 3741 model in use and is commensurate in height so that it could be positioned conveniently for the operator's use. The IBM 3713 requires a separate table or desktop space, with paper handling support. The IBM 3715 printer is designed to use a single electronics board as the entire adapter and represents a very close integration of the mechanical hardware and the electronics of the board which in turn is directed by inputs from the processor on the host station. The difference between the printers requires a jumper change on the adapter board, but a different motor and pulley when changing a 40 cps machine to 80 cps. The same motor and pulley is used if the change is from 80 to 120 cps. * IBM 3717 Printer The IBM 3717 Printer is a band printer or line printer which is considerably larger in size and speeds measured in lines/minute rather than characters per second. Depending upon the number of embossed characters on the band being used, the printer rate with 64 characters is 120 lines per minute and with 48 characters is 155 lines per minute. The quality of the printed output is excellent and the bands have a reasonable long life. Though the bands are expensive and require replacement as they wear out, the speed and quality of the printed output overcomes the logistics of maintenance in many applications. The handling of the incoming paper and the printed output is supplied on the printer's stand. This printer was amazingly fast to someone who was used to a matrix printer, being capable of producing a days-worth of matrix printed output in a few minutes and having the printed output of excellent quality versus matrix quality. However, the cost of the printer including service and maintenance put it out of range that many businesses were willing to afford. The life of the band in characters printed was short compared to the life of the printhead of the matrix printer. So the decision to incorporate the IBM 3717 printer into a customer's configuration is not an easy sell. * IBM 3540 Diskette Input/Output Unit The IBM 3540 Diskette Input/output Unit was not specifically part of the IBM 3740 system but provides high speed input and output over a LAN connection https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_ring and through diskettes, not to tape as in the IBM 3747.

The station on the Leipzig‚ÄìHof railway was opened as early as 1848, but it gained greater importance only after the Second World War. Gutenf√ºrst was divided from 1945 to 1990 between the American and the Soviet occupation zones and later between West Germany and East Germany. Today only local trains stop here.  History  Until the end of the Second World War  The S√§chsisch-Bayerische Eisenbahn-Compagnie (Saxon-Bavarian Railway Company) received a concession for the construction of a railway line from Leipzig to Hof at the beginning of the 1840s. The first sections from Leipzig were opened in the first half of the 1840s. Due to the high construction costs on the Crimmitschau‚ÄìPlauen section, the company became insolvent and was bought by the Saxon state in 1847. At this time work was already under way on the Plauen‚ÄìHof section to raise further revenue to pay off the expensive bridge structures as quickly as possible. On 20 November 1848, the Plauen‚ÄìHof section was opened together with Gutenf√ºrst station. The entire line was not open until 1851. The station was at first insignificant and had two platforms and a waiting room to cater to the modest passenger traffic. Nevertheless, in 1877 the station was reclassified from a Haltepunkt (halt point) to a Haltestelle (halt place) and at the same time a massive station building was erected. About 700 m of track, including four sets of points, and a wooden loading ramp were built for the freight traffic, which was now accepted. The facilities were supplemented by a freight shed in 1878. A head and side loading lamp was built around 1900. The station was reclassified as a station (Bahnhof) in 1905. In the meantime, the facilities included five tracks, one of which was a two-directional overtaking track, an entrance building with a platform, an outside platform accessible via a passenger subway, a freight shed as well as a residence for railway officials. Over time the Werdau‚àíHof section of the Leipzig‚ÄìHof railway in particular developed into one of the most densely trafficked sections in Germany, but traffic in Gutenf√ºrst station was always modest. The station was always low in terms of freight and passenger traffic compared with other Saxon stations. Thus, only 4300 t was handled in 1899 and it was still round 8700 t in 1913. In the same years about 25,000 and 29,000 passengers were handled respectively. The station survived the Second World War undamaged, but destruction on the Leipzig‚ÄìHof railway meant that traffic could only be maintained until April 1945 at the latest.  Border station Thuringia and parts of Saxony were still occupied by the Americans in April and May 1945, but they withdrew at the beginning of July 1945 to the demarcation line established in the spring of 1945. The Red Army then occupied the territories assigned to Soviet control. Gutenf√ºrst, as the last station before the line of demarcation, had thus become a border station. In the early days there were only irregular trains, mainly carrying returnees, refugees and coal. From 20 December 1945 onwards, freight trains carrying lignite were regularly running from the central Germany brown coal mining area over the zonal border. At first Mehltheuer station had been designated as a transfer station, because Gutenf√ºrst had no facilities. Trains were only loaded in Gutenf√ºrst after the installation of another track. Limited travel was possible from the first half of 1947, when passengers were allowed to use a mail train. However, crossing between the zones was continually blocked between 20 October and 1 November 1947, during the Berlin Blockade (June 1948 to May 1949) and in May 1952. Unrestricted interzonal traffic through the Gutenf√ºrst border station was not accepted until 1954. From September 1964 onwards, the volume of traffic increased once again and freight trains to West Berlin also operated through Gutenf√ºrst. Administration of the station was carried out by the Soviet Military Administration until 1952, later by the border police (Deutsche Grenzpolizei) and finally by the Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic. In the first decades, the border crossing was not rigorously secured, but between 1975 and 1980, Gutenf√ºrst station was fortified. Major projects were the construction of a bridge over all the tracks, a large floodlight system with eight masts and a terminal track for local services within the GDR towards Plauen, which was outside the strictly secured control zone. Overall, the reconstruction cost 16 million marks and some works continued until 1982.  Developments since 1989/90  With the reunification of Germany the importance of the station fell rapidly. In the initial period after the border opening on 9 November 1989, rail services were chronically overloaded, but they returned to normal soon after. No border controls were carried out after 1 July 1990. In 1990/91, an apprentice workshop was established in the station buildings by Deutsche Reichsbahn. It provided training in the field of communication electronics, an educational qualification that had only recently emerged and partially replaced the skilled worker for automatic machinery (Facharbeiter f√ºr Betriebsmess-, Steuerungs- und Regelungstechnik) qualification. Deutsche Bahn invested several million marks here. Later a dormitory was integrated with it. The training was discontinued at the end of the 1990s. As a result there was basically only one final class that was trained here to be communications electronics technicians in the department of information technology from 1991 to 1995. The buildings remained largely unchanged. The observation bridge was removed in early 2013 during the electrification of the Reichenbach‚àíHof section. Today only local services of the Erfurter Bahn and the Vogtlandbahn stop at the station.

As of 2018, he is the Chief Disruption Officer at GEMS Education, one of the world's largest private educators based out of Dubai, UAE. Krish has also been a vocal advocate for the banking sector to be early adopters or fast-followers of digital technology as ‚Äúa mindset of continual learning and innovation‚Äù rather than as a project.  Life and career  Krish was born and raised in Ambasamudram in Tamil Nadu. An interest in basic programming took the alumnus of St Xavier's College, Palayamkottai, from his degree in General Science to an advanced diploma in Technology and Information Systems and a Postgraduate Diploma in International Business from the Indian Institute of Modern Management (IIMM). Over two decades of an international career, Krish went on to bring significant positive impact through technology in Fortune 500 organizations like Citigroup and Fidelity Investments. In 2016 he told Computer News ME that his early career made him aware that the Western world was more aware of the benefits IT could bring businesses, but that the Middle Eastern business community is catching up to the West.  Middle-East Banking Career  In 2006, Krish took up management roles in the First Gulf Bank and implemented enterprise-wide changes in processes, program governance and change management. Krish told Computer News ME that over the period, business satisfaction levels on IT rose significantly to 86 percent. This was followed by a two-year project in a senior position at BankMuscat International where major transformations took place in data centers, IT systems, CRM, trading platform, core banking and other areas. = iCAN Project = In 2012 Krish joined Qatar Islamic Bank (QIB) as group Chief Information Officer (CIO), where he spearheaded the bank-wide iCAN program with the aim of replacing the bank‚Äôs 15 year old infrastructure with new core banking platforms, greater automation of operational processes etc. Deloitte and Temenos were contributing partners in the project, and together helped bring business satisfaction levels on IT significantly to 86 percent. QIB acknowledged Krish‚Äôs contribution towards growth and improvement, which led to the revision and updation of existing IT policies, creation of new IT processes under the ITIL Best Practices Framework, comprehensive CSA risk management exercises along with proper tracking and logging of internal and external audits, RCA and IT incident reports, among other changes. = Al Hilal Bank Vision 2020 = In 2016‚Äì2017, he served as the Chief Information Officer/ Chief Digital Officer of the Al Hilal Bank in UAE. In his position as the leader of the bank's Vision 2020 IT & Digital Strategy, he spearheaded a transformation drive to connect banking digital channels with FinTech to further the institution's goals to become one of the most technologically advanced institutions in the region.  Disruption in Education  As Chief Disruption Officer of the GEMS Education group, Krish is spearheading a 5-year phased plan to introduce 50 initiatives across the categories of education innovation, customer experience, technology standardization, process improvements, and data and analytics. According to him, \\"...education is no different from other industries ‚Äì it's either disrupt or be disrupted.\\" Krish explains the value-addition this new C-suite role can bring to an organization, in an interview for the Wall Street Journal: > CDOs can help fill leadership gaps, manage conflicts between business lines > and the technology organization, and find equilibrium between disruptive > imperatives and process transformation. By seeking solutions that can alter > the entire industry landscape, CDOs allow the company to disrupt rather than > be disrupted. They constantly pursue technology breakthroughs and help the > organization adopt a culture that promotes disruption. Giving disruption a > home in the C-suite can help organizations prioritize it, integrate it into > existing business strategies and scale the disruption process. Krish's approach to disruptive transformations in education institutions is customer-centric, as he explains at his DIGITRANS 2018 speech: > We are living in an era where customers shape strategies not the corporates. > It is absolutely critical to know your customers well and to build end to > end customer journeys incorporating the products / services through > frictionless channel experience. Customer experience is not only about your > external customers but also about your employees and stakeholders. While technology is the core of a disruption plan, Krish says \\"Investing in the right people and honing their skills to meet the challenges ahead is crucial, as are optimized and automated processes that allow us to make the best use of available resources. The right balance of people, processes, technology, and innovative product and service offerings is critical...\\"  Awards and recognition  2015 As reported in the February 2016 issue of the Computer News Middle East magazine, Krish was named as one of the best CIOs of the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region for 2015, being the only CIO from Qatar‚Äôs banking industry to receive the honor. = 2016 = He was awarded the CIO of the year award at the MEFTECH Innovation Awards.

Before 1933 she was editor in chief of the SPD women's magazine \\"Genossin\\". After 1945 she worked in the Schumacher Office set up in 1945 in order to recreate the party by the man who became its first postwar leader. Within the party executive, between 1946 and 1956, she can be described as \\"the main voice of SPD women's policies ... as the women's officer (Frauenbeauftragte)\\". Life Herta Gotthelf was born in Breslau (as Wroc≈Çaw was known before 1945) which is where she grew up. Recalling her childhood she later wrote that politics were never discussed in her parents' house, but she herself was already politically engaged even at school. In 1918 she joined the Social Democratic Party (\\"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / SPD). Even before this she had been active in the youth wing of the anti-war Spartacus League (\\"Spartakus-Jugend\\") in which youthful comrades looked forward to a new postwar world without exploitation and war. In 1921 she was a member of a group of young socialist from Breslau who took part in the SPD party conference at G√∂rlitz: here she felt naturally drawn to the left-wing of the party, opposing the possibility that the SPD might enter into coalition with the liberal-centrist People's Party. In the meanwhile, she embarked on a training for work in a bank which she pursued as a career, first in Breslau and later in Cologne. However, she increasingly placed her political interests ahead of her career, and by 1924 she found herself unemployed. She spent a year attending lectures at the Labour Academy in Frankfurt as a \\"free listener\\", while supporting herself by working in a perfume factory. Those whose lectures she attended included the labour lawyer Hugo Sinzheimer and his then assistant, Ernst Fraenkel. After attending lectures for a year at the Labour Academy, in 1925 she volunteered to work for the SPD party executive, which was embarking on a recruitment drive in a search for party officers and journalists of the future. This involved moving to Berlin. After a brief period as an intern working on the SPD newspaper \\"Frauenwelt\\" (\\"Women's World\\") Gotthelf was given a paid job in 1926 as secretary to Marie Juchacz, to which was added the job of editing the party magazine \\"Genossin\\" ([female] \\"Comrade\\" ), a successor publication to Die Gleichheit founded by Clara Zetkin. Working with Marie Juchacz, who was a member of the Reichstag and a senior party member, brought Gotthelf into contact with many of the party luminaries of that time, such as , and Clara Bohm-Schuch. As a result of her editorship she also attended international socialist conferences which enabled her to establish political contacts in other European countries. The political backdrop changed dramatically with the Nazi take-over in January 1933. The new government lost no time in transforming Germany into a one-party post-democratic dictatorship, while Herta Gotthelf set her party political work aside. As a journalist, as a social democrat, and on account of her Jewish provenance, she was nevertheless in danger of arrest or worse in the new Germany, and at the beginning of 1934 she emigrated to London with her life partner. Her partner moved on to the United States, but Gotthelf remained in London for more than a decade. In London, initially, she supported herself with cleaning work and child care work. Subsequently, she undertook various other jobs, providing German language lessons, writing articles and for a period working as the secretary of her fellow exile, the novelist Ernst Toller. After the outbreak of war in September 1939, Gotthelf was also giving lecturers to organisations that included the British Labour Party and trades unions. Between 1943 and 1946 she was working for the BBC. From 1942 she was a member of the exiled SPD committee in London. Between 1941 and 1944 she also belonged to the labour committee of the British group of German trades unionists. She appears to have engaged in extensive networking with members of the British Labour party, including John Hynd who after the war became a government minister with responsibility for the \\"British portion\\" of occupied Germany. She also co- founded, with other exiles from Germany, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, Poland, Italy, France and Norway a small London based \\"Women's International\\" group, which she subsequently described as a piece of \\"self-evidently socialist solidarity in the middle of bomb-destroyed London\\", an enterprise on which she would later look back with great satisfaction. Gotthelf returned to Germany early in 1946, settling in what had become, since May 1945, the British occupation zone (after May 1949 the German Federal Republic (West Germany). She was an early participant in the (initially \\"illegal\\") Schumacher Office set up in a first floor office in a surviving building in Hanover by Kurt Schumacher in April 1945 in order to recreate the SPD. On 9‚Äì11 May 1946, at the invitation of Dr. Schumacher, she attended, as a \\"foreign guest\\", the first postwar SPD party conference, held in Hanover. In July 1946 Gotthelf took charge of the party's national women's secretariat. The next year, at the 1947 party conference, held in Nuremberg, she was also given charge over the party's women's newspaper, relaunched in 1947 with the old title \\"Genossin\\" ([female] \\"Comrade\\" ), and rebranded in 1950 as \\"Equality. Publication of the working woman\\" (\\"Gleichheit. Organ der arbeitenden Frau\\"). She also made repeated attempts to use the contacts she had made in the British Labour Party during her years of exile to gain practical support from Labour Party comrades for the Social Democratic Party in Germany, and the need to create a less \\"old-fashioned\\" approach to female political and economic emancipation both within the party and more generally across the British occupation zone. For the most part British Labour Party contacts, including the responsible government minister, John Hynd, preferred to concentrate their energies on their own domestic problems. Despite the challenges presented by acute postwar austerity, there are sources indicating that Herta Gotthilf was successful in mobilising women for the SPD. She arranged mass mailings of circular letters and other practical information sources on issues such as women's employment and education, the creation of information and sexual counselling centres, advice on election campaigning, on consumer co-operatives and trades union issues. One constant theme of Gotthelf's agenda involved promoting reform of the Abortion Law (¬ß118), then as subsequently a source of contention between the liberal-socialist elements and Christian-conservatives in West Germany. At the national level the SPD remained a party of opposition throughout the 1950s and most of the 1960s. Their particularly disappointing 1957 election result triggered widespread discussion within the party as to its causes, which led to the 1959 Godesberg Program at which the party for the first time unambiguously defined its objective as the reform of capitalism rather than the replacement of capitalism. The likely direction of travel was already apparent at the 1958 party conference, held in Stuttgart, at which Herta Gotthelf was one of two members not re-elected to the party executive. (The other was Fritz Heine). Gotthelf nevertheless continued as editor of \\"Gleichheit\\" and a member of the party's women's committee for the rest of her life. Herta Gotthelf died at Alf (a village in the hills between Trier and Koblenz) as the result of a stroke.

It was triggered by the resignation of Jeff Carr (the sitting Labor member) on 28 February 1991, due to his expulsion from cabinet. The election was won by the Liberal candidate, Bob Bloffwitch, who won 51.4 percent of the two-candidate-preferred (2CP) vote. The National Party also made the final 2CP count, despite having not stood a candidate in Geraldton since the 1974 state election, whereas Labor slumped to just 16.6 percent on first preferences, a swing of 31 points from the 1989 state election. Background Jeff Carr, a former schoolteacher, had held Geraldton for the Labor Party since the 1974 state election. However, he was nearly defeated at the 1986 election, falling from a comfortably safe majority of 63.1 percent of the two-party preferred vote to an extremely marginal 50.4 percent.

Clemens Torv near Store Torv. The building was erected in 1895 by designs of the architect Sophus Frederik K√ºhnel in a historicist style drawing inspiration from the Italian Renaissance. R√∏merhus is located on one of the busiest pedestrian streets in Aarhus and has through its existence primarily been used for commercial purposes.  History  Construction of R√∏merhus was completed in 1895. Ownership at the time of construction is not known but the first tenants included the company Crome & Goldschmidts Fabriker which opened a small factory and store on the ground floor facing Skt. Clemens Torv. The company had been founded in Horsens in 1860 with prisoners from Horsens Straffeanstalt (Horsens Penitentiary) as the main source of labor. The store in R√∏merhus was the first branch outside Horsens. Another tenant was Johannes Neye who opened a branch of his leather- and gallantry store NEYE in the building on the side facing Skt. Clemens Str√¶de and Skt. Clemens Torv. NEYE was up to 2015 the second-oldest store on the pedestrian shopping street Str√∏get, after the store Buus on the corner of Ryesgade and S√∏nder All√©. On 15 January 1918 R√∏merhus was bought by the bank Jyllandsbanken which stayed in the building for 10 years until it left and sold it to the insurance company Hafnia for 625.000 kroner in 1928. The building was renamed to Hafniahus (Hafnia House). In 1984 Hafnia bought another property, the Regina building on S√∏ndergade, which it also named Hafniahus. Having two buildings named Hafniahus proved confusing so after 56 years it was changed back to the original name R√∏merhus. In 2011 the company Bestseller bought the building and contracted the architect firm E+N Arkitektur A/S for a large renovation project aimed at bringing R√∏merhus back to its original state.  Architecture  R√∏merhus is a four-winged building with a revivalist design drawing inspiration from French and Italian Renaissance architecture. The midsection of the building features a large dome which is thought to draw inspiration from Magasin du Nord's building in Copenhagen. The architect on the project was Sophus Frederik K√ºhnel who worked on some other significant historicist works in Aarhus such as Mejlborg from 1898 and Business- and Agricultural Bank of Jutland from 1900. The registered constructor on the project is the mason A.I. Petersen. The building is one of four large and notable corner buildings that was constructed to frame St. Clemens Bridge and Aarhus Municipal atlas notes it as the first city block structure in the city. It was built on difficult terrain with large height differences - there are six stories towards √Öboulevarden but just 4 stories facing Skt. Clemens Torv. The Bestseller renovation starting in the 2015 aims to bring R√∏merhus back to its original expression. Among other things this will entail putting a spire back on the dome, removing the bay windows and returning the color scheme to the original.

To reduce fatal ship collisions, these required restrictions include speed limits of no more than 10-knots for vessels of 65 feet or greater in certain locations and at certain times of the year along the east coast of the U.S. Atlantic seaboard.  History  The population of the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) has declined since 1970 due to commercial whaling and heavy vessel traffic in the North Atlantic Ocean. Although commercial whaling has been contributing to the protection the species since 1935, the population has failed to make a full recovery. With an average population of 400, the North Atlantic right whale is currently on the IUCN Red ListI, classified as an endangered species.  Sunset Provision  In terms of public policy, the Sunset provision is a regulation or part of legislation that provides an automatic repeal of a law that has reached its specific expiration date. The ruling to eliminate the sunset provision regarding vessel speed restrictions was first proposed in June 2013. The National Marine Fisheries Service accepted comments from the public about measures that would be taken for assessing the long term costs and benefits of the rule to the endangered North Atlantic right whale population. The sunset provision was set to expire on December 9, 2013. Final ruling to remove the provision (implementing vessel speed restrictions in order to reduce the threat of collisions with North Atlantic right whales) went into effect on December 6, 2013.  Science-based Marine Policy Decision  North Atlantic right whales are considered to be the most critically endangered mammals, with the populations continuously declining. Large whales have low rates of reproduction, in turn, creating low recovery rates. The life expectancy for a right whale is 60 years. In order for populations to grow, projections for the species show that a female would be required to give birth to an average of four calves in her lifetime. In most cases, half of the calves born are males, therefore, the survival rate of the remaining two females are given half the chance of survival. Anthropogenic activities are proving to be the lead cause of the North Atlantic right whales' inability to recover from population decline. The main causes of death to the species include ship collisions and entanglement in fishing gear.NOAA Fisheries web page on NA right whales Most collisions appear to occur during peak feeding, calving, and migratory periods as they tend to spend more time on the surface at these times.

It's a very simple and interesting theme, all about Kashmir where J&K; and the Kashmiri people are central to certain developments taking place in the movie. In the recent past, Kashmir has been portrayed in many films for the unrest in the region, however in this film there is no violence and the movie depicts the beauty and chastity of Kashmir and Kashmiris. The movie portrays how even today Muslims and Pandit‚Äôs stay in harmony in the J&K; valley. The film travels through lots of beautiful locations in Kashmir which have never been shown before. It's a soul-searching journey for the characters where they meet different people undergoing their challenges in very difficult conditions and yet they are positive, hopeful and facing the harsh realities of life with a 'never say die' attitude.

This study caught the attention of politicians at home and abroad. Birch followed in 1987 with the book Job creation in America : how our smallest companies put the most people to work. Birch's work has been heavily criticized but is nevertheless considered groundbreaking as it opened the field for the study of small businesses, which had been so far disregarded by economists. The Birch index, an economic indicator of employment, was developed by Birch. It multiplies absolute job growth by relative job growth, which reveals the employment-creation power of differently sized enterprises.

The inscription reads Docdocos burat titi, insinuating that \\"Docdocos\\" has an uncircumcised penis, which is a cultural taboo for young adult males in the Philippines. Tagalog profanity can refer to a wide range of offensive, blasphemous, and taboo words or expressions in the Tagalog language of the Philippines. Due to Filipino culture, expressions which may sound benign when translated back to English can cause great offense; while some expressions English speakers might take great offense to can sound benign to a Tagalog speaker. Filipino, the national language of the Philippines, is the standard register of Tagalog, so as such the terms Filipino profanity and Filipino swear words are sometimes also employed. In Tagalog, profanity has many names: in a religious or formal context, it is called lapastangang pananalita (\\"blasphemous/irreverent speech\\") or pag-alipusta/panlalait (\\"insult\\"). The word paghamak is also sometimes used formally and has a sense similar to \\"affront\\". Colloquially, the words mura (\\"swear word\\") and sumump√¢ (\\"to wish evil [on someone]\\") are used. Owing to successive Spanish and American colonial administrations, much Tagalog profanity has its etymological roots in the profanity of European languages. Unlike in Western culture, where certain words are never acceptable in all but the most informal contexts, Tagalog profanity is context-sensitive: words which are considered profane or insulting in one context are often acceptable in another.  Putang ina mo  Rodrigo Duterte saying putang ina during a 5 September 2016 speech at Francisco Bangoy International Airport. Owing partly to its use in speeches by Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte, the phrase putang ina mo (sometimes shortened to tang ina or minced as PI) has received considerable international attention and controversy as to its meaning. Puta is a borrowed word from Spanish, in which language it means \\"whore\\". Ina is Tagalog for mother, while mo is the indirect second person singular pronoun. Therefore, if translated word-for-word, the phrase means \\"your mother is a whore\\". However, most Tagalog speakers dispute this simplistic translation, instead alternately rendering the phrase as \\"son of a bitch\\" or as a variation of the word \\"fuck\\". According to linguist Ben Zimmer, given the context and how the meaning of puta has shifted in Tagalog, the best translation of Duterte's original \\"Putang-ina, mumurahin kita diyan sa forum na iyan. Huwag mo akong ganunin.\\" would be \\"Fuck, I will cuss you out at that forum. Don't do that to me.\\" Besides being directed at people, putang ina can be just as well directed at inanimate objects: University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os alumnus Cheeno Marlo M. Sayuno has documented the use of \\"tang ina error!\\" as an expression of exasperation due to PC errors, and \\"Uy net! Putang ina mo!\\" as something akin to \\"Hey, [slow] internet [connection], fuck you!\\" As in the English fucking, the phrase can also be used as an adjective, as in the case of \\"putanginang aso\\" (\\"fucking dog\\") or \\"Diyos ko, putanginang buhay ko!\\" (\\"God, fuck my shitty life!\\") This non-literal meaning of the phrase putang ina mo has twice been affirmed by the Supreme Court of the Philippines: first in 1969 in its decision to Rosauro Reyes v. The People of the Philippines (G.R. No. L-21528 and No. L-21529), and then in 2006 in its decision to Noel Villanueva v. People of the Philippines and Yolanda Castro (G.R. No. 160351). In Reyes, a certiorari appeal to a criminal defamation and grave threats case, the court acquitted the defendant, ruling that his use of a protest sign reading \\"Agustin, putang ina mo\\" did not constitute defamation as In Villanueva, another slander case involving two local politicians of Concepcion, Tarlac, the court reiterated its interpretation of the phrase, but the other facts of the case precluded acquittal.  Walang hiya  Hiya is a Filipino psychological concept similar to face and modesty in other cultures. Author Mary Isabelle Bresnahan has described it thus: \\"just as the sensitive makahiya plant protects its inside from direct touch, so too do people hold back in defense of loob [their inner selves].\\" When translated to English, the words \\"shame\\", \\"embarrassment\\" and \\"dishonor\\" can be employed as a substitute for hiya depending on context. Like much Tagalog profanity, the phrase \\"Walang hiya ka!\\" (You have no shame!) can vary in offense taken from very little to \\"the ultimate loob-wounding comment\\" depending on context and the relationship between the speaker and the receiver. According to Gerhard van den Top, allegations of shamelessness are most damaging when the social class of people differ, and the poor may consciously avoid interaction with the rich to prevent even unspoken damage to hiya. In his oft-cited 1964 article \\"Hiya\\", psychologist Jaime C. Bulatao defines Walang hiya as \\"recklessness regarding the social expectations of society, an inconsideration for the feelings of others, and an absence of sensitivity to the censures of authority or society.\\"  Tae  Unlike in many other languages, Tagalog has no word for excrement that would be considered considerably vulgar, such as English shit or Spanish mierda. The two Tagalog words for feces, tae and dumi, are closer to the sense of the English poop. In fact, these words are often used even in medical contexts: a pagtae is a bowel movement, while magtae references diarrhea. Tae, is, however, considered by some to be slightly more crass than the more euphemistic dumi. Nevertheless, these words can still be used to cause offense if the speaker adds to them, of course, as in the expression Kain tae (eat shit).  Punyeta  Descended from the Spanish pu√±eta, the Tagalog version of this word is seldom used in the Spanish sense of \\"wanker\\", but rather as an interjection expressing frustration, disappointment, or misery. When punyeta is used as an insult directed at a person as in \\"Mga punyeta kayo!\\" (You are all punyeta(s)!), it has a sense similar to the English word asshole. This word was used heavily by John Arcilla's character in the 2015 Philippine epic film Heneral Luna in lines such as \\"Ingles- inglesin mo ko sa bayan ko?! Punyeta!\\" (Speaking English to me in my own country? What nerve!). Ambeth R. Ocampo, writing in the Philippine Daily Inquirer, criticized the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB) for giving the film a R-13 rating despite the use of this word and others just because the swear words were Spanish-derived. Other observers have described punyeta as being as obscene as putang ina mo.  Gago  Gago is a descendant of the Portuguese word gago and gaguejar, meaning \\"stupid\\", \\"foolish\\" or \\"ignorant\\". It is interchangeable with the related words tanga, (b)ugok, ‚Äúbotlog‚Äù,(b)ulol and bobo. In Portuguese, gago means \\"stutterer\\", but in Tagalog it has completely lost this meaning. Slang terms derived from gago are kagaguhan (\\"a foolish action\\"), ogag (same meaning as gago), and nakagago (\\"to be made to feel stupid\\"). Ulol, loko, and sira ulo can be used similarly, but they are not interchangeable; they also imply madness or mental retardation on top of stupidity. According to Article 27 (\\"On-Air Language\\") of the Association of Broadcasters of the Philippines's 2007 Broadcast Code of the Philippines, \\"Name-calling and personal insults are prohibited.\\" While this code is strictly voluntary and only affects members of the organization, as the organization counts among its members widely syndicated channels such as ABS-CBN and TV5, penalties for breaking this rule affect a large number of broadcasters and media personalities: fines start at 15,000, and quickly escalate to 25,000 and a 90-day suspension. To avoid breaching this rule, some stations have trialed neural networks which listen to the speech of actors and guests/contestants real time during live performances, and automatically censor certain words. In a paper explaining the system, particular attention was paid by the De La Salle University researchers to censoring potentially insulting words such as gago and ulol. Like many Spanish and Portuguese words borrowed into Tagalog, gago is gendered: the female form for a single woman or group of women is gaga, while gago is used for a single man, a group of men, or a group of men and women. According to the UP Diksiyonaryong Filipino, gago is also used in the sense of mahina ang ulo (a slow learner).  Pakshet  Pakshet is a portmanteau of the English words \\"fuck\\" and \\"shit\\", altered to fit the phonology of Filipino; the words pak and shet can also be used on their own to similar effect. While most commonly used as an interjection, rather non-intuitively for English speakers, pakshet can also be used as an insult describing a person, as in Pakshet ka!, which could be rendered as Fuck you! or [You] asshole! in English. Summit Media's Spot.ph online magazine claims that the word pakshet was popularized by the 2002 film Jologs, but given its etymology, it may date back to the first American contacts with the Philippines.  Buwisit  Buwisit (sometimes spelled bwisit), is a Tagalog expression used for unlucky events, or for something that is a nuisance. Mildly vulgar, it derives from the Hokkien Chinese expression (PeÃçh-≈çe-jƒ´: b≈ç- u√Æ-s√≠t), literally meaning \\"without clothes or food\\". An example of use would be \\"Buwisit naman 'yang ulan na 'yan\\", meaning, \\"Damn that rain!\\", literally, \\"It's so unlucky that it rained.\\"  Letse  Letse, alternatively \\"Leche\\", is used as an expression of annoyance or anger. It can be used as an interjection i.e. \\"leche!\\", or in a sentence. It is in the same context of \\"bwisit\\" i.e. \\"bwisit na mga tao 'to; leche na mga tao 'to (lit. these people are annoying) which can be contextually translated to \\"these fuckin' people.\\"\\" It became popular when Spanish was still the language used by a major demographic in the country. Letse or leche (Spanish for \\"milk\\") is derived from the Spanish profanity \\"Me cago en la leche,\\" which literally translates to \\"I defecate in the milk\\" where leche is a euphemism for ley (\\"law\\"), referring to the Law of Moses.  Hayop  Hinayupak is another Tagalog vulgar word, referring to a person acting like an animal, which has as its root the word hayop, which means \\"animal\\". Hayop can be used on its own as well, as in, hayop kayo!, meaning, \\"you animals!\\"  Lintik  Lintik is a Tagalog word meaning \\"lightning\\", also a mildly profane word used to someone contemptible, being wished to be hit by lightning, such as in \\"Lintik ka!'. The term is mildly vulgar and an insult, but may be very vulgar in some cases, especially when mixed with other profanity. Sometimes, lintik is also used as a verb through adding verbalizing affixes, such as in \\"Malilintikan ka sa akin!\\", that may roughly translate to English \\"Get damned!\\" or \\"Goddamn you!\\".  Blasphemous terms  Susmaryosep is a Roman Catholic-inspired profanity invoking the Holy Family i.e. Jesus, Mary and Joseph.  Sexual terms  The word bibingka, a type of Filipino rice cake, is a common euphemism for the vagina. Like most other languages, Tagalog has a wide variety of profane words for the action of intercourse and the names of genitalia or parts thereof.  Genitalia  In Tagalog, the vagina is most often referred to with the words puki, kiki, or pekpek; tinggil is used for the clitoris, titi and burat are used for the penis and bayag for the scrotum. All of these words are considered considerably rude in general conversation, and Tan notes that English words for genitalia, such as \\"penis\\" and \\"vagina\\", are almost always considered more polite, perhaps because they sound more medical. As in other languages, euphemisms for genitalia abound: the male genitalia may be alternately referred to as a saging (banana), an ahas (snake), or a talong (eggplant), among other names. Researcher Michael Tan notes that the euphemisms for the vagina are considered more vulgar than those for the penis, and as such are fewer; but noted among them are mani (peanut), bibingka and bulaklak (flower). He posits patriarchal norms as the reason for this discrepancy. Suso is the term most often applied to the breasts, but it is not considered profane and has connotations of breastfeeding; boob, imported from English slang, is the most widely used term for breasts that might be considered impolite. Tagalog has no analog of the vulgar English word ass: the word puwit, meaning buttocks, carries no particular sexual meaning on its own. Tuli is a male circumcision rite of passage in the Philippines, and being uncircumcised is considered in many parts of the country to be taboo; the vulgar word supot (literally, plastic or paper bag) refers to an uncircumcised male and denotes weakness, inferiority and even lack of hygiene.  Intercourse  According to a study involving the use of \\"sexual keywords\\" among twenty female participants by researcher Michael L. Tan, sexual terms in Tagalog have widely different connotations: some words, such as kantot or hindut, are undeniably profane in all contexts, while others, such as euphemistic use of the verbs gamit (to use), mag-ano (to do \\"you know what\\") or mangyari (to happen), \\"ginalaw\\" (to move) are more socially acceptable. Some words for intercourse are English derived: mag-do (to \\"do it\\"), mag-sex (to have sex) and the plain verb fuck are reportedly common among upper class Filipinos. \\"Isinuko ang Bataan\\" is a connotation for a woman to give her virginity to a man by letting him penetrate her. Tan posits that most sexual language in the Philippines is patriarchal: it focuses on the actions and expectations of the male, rather than female, participants. As an example, gamit tends to be used as Ginamit ako ng mister ko (\\"My husband 'used' me\\"), but such turn of phrase would never be used by a straight man. Tan uses other metaphors, such as the relationship between the euphemisms pagdidilig (\\"to water plants\\") and magpadilig (\\"to be watered\\"), and a woman waiting patiently for sex is described as uhaw (thirsty), to forward this theory: in his view, the Tagalog language subconsciously puts the woman in the passive role. Anal intercourse, even when between a man and a woman, has its origins in homosexual slang: terms such as an-an and uring are used to describe it. Other names for sexual acts and positions have their histories rooted in Spanish: cunnilingus is referred to as brotsa (from brocha), while fellatio is tsupa (from chupar). Male masturbation can be referred to as jakol, salsal, bato or bati; descriptions of female masturbation typically employ the verb mag-finger (\\"to finger oneself\\").

They were made after O'Keeffe moved with her new husband into an apartment on the 30th floor of the Shelton Hotel, which gave her expansive views of all but the west side of the city. She expressed her appreciation of the city's early skyscrapers that were built by the end of the 1920s. One of her most notable works, which demonstrates her skill at depicting the buildings in the Precisionist style, is the Radiator Building‚ÄîNight, New York, of the American Radiator Building. Background In November 1925, O'Keeffe moved into one of New York City's tallest skyscrapers, the Shelton Hotel, with her husband of one year, Alfred Stieglitz. They lived on the 30th floor with clear, unobstructed northern, eastern, and southern views of the city. The building was located between 48th and 49th Streets on Lexington Avenue. O'Keeffe said of her interest in painting cityscapes, \\"I know it's unusual for an artist to want to work way up near the roof of a big hotel, in the heart of a roaring city, but I think that's just what the artist of today needs for stimulus. ... Today the city is something bigger, grander, more complex than ever before in history.\\" Like photographer Charles Sheeler, watercolorist Charles Demuth, and other artists, she was interested in capturing \\"the mystique of the skyscrapers\\" that were a symbol of the modern world, and, at that time, a largely American phenomenon. Claude Fayette Bragdon, an American architect, said, \\"Not only is the skyscraper a symbol of the American Spirit‚Äîrestless, centrifugal, seriously poised‚Äîbut it is the only original development in the field of architecture to which we can lay unchallenged claim.\\" File:New York Sky-Line (1922).pngNew York skyline in 1920 File:10 E 40th Street NYC.jpg10 East 40th Street, in New York City, built in the 1920s File:Chrysler Building Midtown Manhattan New York City 1932.jpg1932 skyscrapers Overview O'Keeffe made about 25 drawings and paintings of New York City skyscrapers and cityscapes between 1925 and 1929. Her works are evocative of her own style. In 1925, she created New York Street with Moon, which reflects her opinion that \\"one can't paint New York as it is, but rather as it is felt.\\" Between the city skyscrapers is a sunset with a moon and fluffy clouds. The tall buildings, in an angled composition, are in the shadows and a streetlight casts a bright halo. She made The Shelton with Sunspots, N.Y. in 1926 that depicts an optical illusion that O'Keeffe saw of the Shelton Hotel one morning where there appeared to be \\"a bite out of one side of the tower made by the sun, with sunspots against the building and against the sky\\". An abstract painting made of rectangles and circles, it unifies the man-made skyscraper and the natural effect of glaring sunlight and sunspots against the building. The composition, taken from the street level, reflects the sense of awe that O'Keeffe felt about skyscrapers. City Night, made the same year, depicts another form of illusion. The skyscrapers in the painting converge vertically, creating a cavernous image with simple geometric shapes. The buildings tower above the city streets and the bright moon. \\"With the eyes of a modernist, she has simplified the internal articulation of these behemoths, thus emphasizing their dark, vertical silhouettes against the deep blue sky,\\" states art historian Eleanor Tufts. O'Keeffe used light in New York Night (1928/1929) to indicate \\"warmth and life in the city\\", though lighted streets and illuminated windows of dark buildings. Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art describes Radiator Building‚ÄîNight, New York as O'Keeffe's \\"grandest statement on New York City\\". While made with a simplified style of Precisionism, it is also a realistic and skillful depiction of an architectural building. O'Keeffe portrays the architectural elements of the Radiator Building, and what it looks like illuminated against the night sky. The upper floors of the building look like steps, which are illuminated at night with bright lights. Electric companies encouraged architects to include lighting in their designs, which made the buildings look more impressive. A diagonal beam evokes movement. The ethereal smoke, which lines look like flowers, is contrasted against the straight lines of the skyscraper. Stieglitz's name is set in red lights by the Scientific American Building and the composition may be seen as a double portrait, with O'Keeffe represented by the Radiator Building. Cityscapes O'Keeffe depicted a realistic view of Manhattan rooftops, the East River, and Long Island City of Queens in East River from the Thirtieth Story of the Shelton Hotel in 1928. Beyond the Manhattan skyline and the East River, factories in Queens emit smoke, creating a smoggy atmosphere and a dismal image. 1929 events O'Keeffe stopped depicting New York's skyscrapers and its cityscape in 1929, when she went to Mabel Dodge Luhan's ranch in Taos, New Mexico and developed an interest in making paintings of the Southwest. At the time, she was unhappy in her marriage and with city life. Additionally, skyscrapers, which had been a symbol of America's success, became a symbol of its failure with the Wall Street Crash of 1929.

During World War I he served first on the battleships Roma and Conte di Cavour, then on the armored cruiser Pisa and finally, as the first fire control officer, on the battleship Dante Alighieri. At the end of the war, he was assigned to the Technical Office of Naval Weapons in Venice and stationed on the repair ship Quarnaro.Enrico Baroni on the Website of the Italian Navy He was then given command of the torpedo boat Cortellazzo and, after promotion to Lieutenant Commander, of the destroyer . In 1932 he was promoted to Commander and appointed executive officer of the heavy cruiser Fiume, and afterwards he held the post of Superior Commander in the Far East, with insignia on the minelayer Lepanto. After repatriation, he was promoted to Captain and appointed commander of the Cagliari Naval Command for a period, before being given command of the light cruiser Luigi Cadorna. In 1940 he was given command of 2nd Destroyer Squadron, with flag on Espero. On June 27, 1940, the Espero, along with sisterships Ostro and Zeffiro, sailed from Taranto for Tobruk in a fast transport mission of some batteries of anti-tank guns; on the following day, however, the three destroyers, sighted by British reconnaissance planes, were intercepted five British light cruisers under Vice Admiral John Tovey. Baroni decided to hold back the British cruisers with his ship as long as possible, so as to give Ostro and Zeffiro the time needed to escape; Espero's sacrifice in fact allowed the two sister ships to escape and reach Benghazi and then Tobruk. Espero, after a solitary two-hour battle against Tovey's ships, was finally hit by the cruiser's fire, left dead in the water, and finished off by HMAS Sydney. After giving orders for the scuttling and the abandonment of the ship, Baroni returned to the bridge and went down with his ship. He was posthumously awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor.

He served as President of Hsiang-Ya Medical College and Vice President of Peking Union Medical College, and was a founding member of both Academia Sinica and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Biography Zhang was born in Changsha, Hunan on December 28, 1897. He graduated from Changjun High School and entered Hsiang-Ya Medical College in 1914, from which he graduated with an M.D. in 1921. He became a chief resident physician at Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) Hospital in 1924. He went to the U.S. for further education at Johns Hopkins University for one year. Zhang became an Associate in Medicine at PUMC in 1932, and engaged in medical research at Stanford University the next year. He returned to China in 1934. After the Second Sino-Japanese War began in 1937, he left Beijing for his hometown Changsha and was appointed Professor and President of Hsiang-Ya. As the Japanese army approached Changsha, he moved the college to Guiyang in 1938, and then to Chongqing in 1944. His advocacy of changing Hsiang-Ya to a national university, was supported by Minister of Education, Chen Lifu, and approved by the Republic of China government in 1940. He accepted a professorship at PUMC Hospital in 1948. Zhang was elected a founding academician of Academia Sinica in 1948 and the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1955. He was appointed Vice President of PUMC in September 1962 and Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences in 1978. Persecution During the Hundred Flowers Campaign in 1956, Zhang, together with other senior doctors including and Li Kehong, openly criticized Communist Party policies at his hospital. When Mao Zedong cracked down on dissent in the ensuing Anti- Rightist Campaign, he spared Zhang, a fellow Hunanese native, from persecution, calling him a \\"simpleminded person who has been manipulated by others\\". The two Doctor Lis, on the other hand, were labelled as \\"rightists\\" and sent to remote provinces for \\"reform\\". They both died soon afterwards in exile. When the Cultural Revolution started in 1966, however, Zhang was not spared persecution and was imprisoned by the Red Guards for nine months. Death and legacy Zhang died of lung cancer on 8 August 1987 in Peking Union Medical College Hospital, at the age of 89. On 20 November 1992, China Post issued a stamp commemorating Zhang as part of the third set of its \\"Modern Chinese Scientists\\" stamp series (serial number 1992-19). 61 million copies were printed.  Family  Zhang had four children, all of whom became scientists or physicians. His eldest daughter Zhang Youduan () is a biochemist with a Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge. His second daughter, a graduate of Hsiang-Ya Medical College, is a radiologist. His son, Zhang Youshang, is a biochemist and academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences who served as Vice President of the Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry. His youngest son, Zhang Youhui (), is an oncologist and former President of the Cancer Institute of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

Career Stolperstein in front of Alexander's former home, Cimbernstra√üe 13, in Berlin-Nikolassee Eduard Ludwig Alexander was born in Essen; his father was an office manager. He attended the Royal Gymnasium at Burgplatz zu Essen, where he received his Abitur in 1900. He then studied at the Humboldt University of Berlin, at the Albert Ludwig University of Freiburg, and at the Universit√© de Lausanne Jura, working from 1911 as a Rechtsanwalt and Justiziar in Berlin. In 1917 Alexander was involved in the formation of the Spartacus League and joined the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) together with his wife upon the founding of the party in the Communist Party in 1918-1919. Between 1921 and 1925, he was a city councillor in Berlin while simultaneously serving, under the pseudonym Eduard Ludwig, as head of the press service of the KPD and financial editor of Die Rote Fahne. At Pentecost in 1923, he and his wife Gertrud participated in the Marxist Labor Week (Marxistische Arbeitswoche) and founded the Frankfurt Institute for Social Research. In 1927 he was a co-founder of the Marxist Labor School, which taught Hermann Duncker, J√ºrgen Kuczynski, Georg Luk√°cs and Karl August Wittfogel among others. In the 1928 election, Alexander was elected to the Reichstag, but was not allowed to run in the 1930 election as a member of the so-called Conciliator faction. In 1931, he was elected mayor of the city of Boizenburg with the support of both the KPD and SPD, but was not able to assume office due to a breakdown of the party alliance.Uwe Wieben: Eduard Alexander: from member of parliament to mayor in Boizenburg: biographical sketch of a nearly forgotten politician of the Weimar Republic .

Edition Temmen, Bremen 2011, p. 130 f. Following the Nazi rise to power in 1933, Alexander was disbarred on the grounds that he was allegedly half-Jewish. Later the same year, he was appointed as an arbitrator for trade affairs of the German-Russian trading association. On 22 August 1944, Eduard Ludwig Alexander was arrested as part of the \\"Aktion Gitter\\" campaign and transferred to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. He died in transit to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp on 1 March 1945. Personal life In 1902, he met Gertrud Gaudin (1882-1967), who at that time was graduating from art studies in Berlin. They married in 1908; under her married name Gertrud Alexander was later known as a communist politician, author, publicist and cultural critic. They divorced in the 1920s and in 1925 she moved to Moscow with both of their children.Vgl. Angaben √ºber Gertrud Alexander auf ddr-biografien.de (abgerufen am 21. August 2009). In 1929 he married Maria Seyring, a physician, with whom he had three children. Memorials Memorial plaque at the Reichstag In Berlin since 1992, Alexander's name appears on one of the 96 plaques in the Memorial to the Murdered Members of the Reichstag, on the corner of Scheidemannstra√üe / Republic Square in Berlin near the Reichstag building. In March 2009, in front of Alexander's former residence at Cimbernstra√üe 13 in the Steglitz-Zehlendorf ‚Äì Nikolassee district of Berlin, a Stolperstein was laid in his memory.

Since then, the organization has worked on cases related torture, prisoners of conscience, abusive laws, women‚Äôs rights, corporate accountability and other human rights violations. In 2020, Amnesty says it was forced to halt its Indian operations due to \\"reprisals\\" from the government. Amnesty claimed its bank accounts were frozen and it's was forced to lay off staff, and suspend all its campaign and research work. The Ministry of Home Affairs claims that Amnesty violated the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) as \\"a significant amount of foreign money was also remitted to Amnesty (India) without MHA‚Äôs approval under FCRA\\" and \\"owing to these illegal practices of Amnesty, the previous government had also rejected the repeated applications of Amnesty to receive funds from overseas. This had led Amnesty to suspend its India operations once during that period as well.\\" Campaigns Amnesty International India collaborates with Railway Protection Force, Western Railways in Mumbai to ensure female passengers‚Äô right to safety. It also runs a campaign to reduce the number of under-trials in jails in India. Some of Amnesty India's campaigns include seeking justice for the victims in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots as well as opposing the use of the death penalty in India.

The book is Mbembe's most well-known work and explores questions of power and subjectivity in postcolonial Africa. The book is split into an introduction, six essays ‚Äì \\"Of Commandement,\\" \\"Of Private Indirect Government,\\" \\"The Aesthetics of Vulgarity,\\" \\"The Thing and Its Doubles,\\" \\"Out of the World,\\" and \\"God's Phallus\\" ‚Äì and a conclusion. It has been characterized as \\"one of the most lastingly provocative and stimulating contributions to the theoretical literature on the postcolonial state in sub-Saharan Africa\\" and is the winner of the 2006 Bill Venter/Altron Award. On the Postcolony was first published in French in 2000 under the title De la postcolonie: essai sur l'imagination politique dans l'Afrique contemporaine. This edition featured a different organizational structure than the English version and did not include Chapter 4, \\"The Thing and Its Doubles.\\" The first English edition of the book was published in 2001 by the University of California Press. Two of the chapters included, \\"The Aesthetics of Vulgarity\\" and \\"The Thing and Its Doubles,\\" had been released previously as journal articles in 1992 and 1996, respectively. On the Postcolony was republished in May 2015 by Wits University Press in an African edition. In this edition's preface, Mbembe describes the collection of essays as  Background and theoretical context  On the Postcolony was written in the context of African colonization by European powers (France and the United Kingdom primarily), which began in the late nineteenth century and ended with decolonization after World War II, concentrated in the early 1960s. Political and social ideologies active in this post-colonial era include Pan- Africanism, Negritude, African Socialism and Marxism, capitalism, and anarchism. In a conversation with the University of the Witwatersrand‚Äôs Isabel Hofmeyr, Mbembe states that he wrote most of On the Postcolony in the early 1990s as Afro-Marxism was fading in influence, leaving African social theory in need of new paradigms and modes of analysis. Mbembe‚Äôs twin inspirations were Congolese music, in which he found ‚Äúthe social memory of the present‚Ä¶ the drama of African self-realization unfolding‚Äù and the Francophone African novel, particularly the work of Sony Labou Tansi, in which ‚Äútime always appeared as heterogeneous and unpredictable.‚Äù At this point of crisis in theory, Mbembe saw this music and literature filling the gaps and wrote the essays which became On the Postcolony in the spirit of these works. Additional influences included post-War French philosophers and writers Bataille, Merleau-Ponty, Foucault, Blanchot, Deleuze, Derrida, Levinas, Ricoeur, Castoriadis, and de Certeau.  Content  While self-contained, each essay contributes a facet to Mbembe's theory of the postcolony and involves a different mode of analysis. These range from the historical, economic, and political (in the initial two chapters) to the literary, fictional, psychoanalytical, philosophical, and theological (in the later four). In Mbembe's view, the overall purpose of his book is to \\"model the complexities of African life for the Africans\\" and \\"theorize time and subjectivity (the consciousness of self and of time) in conditions of a life that is fundamentally contingent and precarious.\\"  Introduction: Time on the Move  In the introduction, translated by A.M. Berrett, Mbembe locates the subsequent essays in the modern context in which, he argues, discourse about Africa ‚Äì by both Westerners and Africans ‚Äì has become largely trapped in Western tropes and fantasies in which Africa is rarely ‚Äúseen as possessing things and attributes properly part of ‚Äòhuman nature‚Äô‚Äù and when so, these are considered ‚Äúof lesser value, little importance, and poor quality.‚Äù In this view, Africa is the ‚Äúabsolute Other‚Äù or anti-West, and it is analyzed in terms of lack and void rather than presence: ‚Äúone of the metaphors through which the West represents the origin of its own norms, develops as self-image, and integrates this image into the set of signifiers asserting what it supposed to be its identity.‚Äù This has resulted in a distortion of discourse about Africa because the continent is evoked primarily for the purpose of meditation on the West rather than for its own reasons and own purposes. It is this handicapped mode of analysis which Mbembe analyzes and from which he departs in the subsequent essays about the history and present of the postcolonial African subject.  Of Commandement  The first chapter takes an economic approach to analyzing the African experience under colonial rule (commandement) and explores the types of rationality used to rule the postcolony, as well as the postcolonial transfer of ruling activities from the African state to Western economic actors (exemplified by the structural adjustment policies of the late twentieth century). Mbembe first explores colonial sovereignty, the violences which created it, and the logic that sustained it. There were two traditions of viewing the colonized to justify colonialism: the first (which Mbembe calls Hegelian) sees the native as an animal possessing drives but not capacities (an object) which can be seen only as the property of power, while the second (which Mbembe calls Bergsonian) sees him as an animal to be domesticated and cared for. He outlines the four properties of commandement - a departure from common law such that colonial companies receive almost royal rights, a regime of privileges and immunities, the lack of distinction between ruling and civilizing, and circular logic such that the purpose of rule was that people obey (rather than for some public good) - and analyzes colonial subjection and the mechanisms through which it is authorized. Mbembe then traces the evolution of these forces to the post-colony, discussing the African state and the global economic order which constrains it.  On Private Indirect Government  This chapter deals with many of the same processes as \\"Of Commandement\\" - violence, privatization of the public, appropriation of the means of livelihood - but examines how they unfold in a nonlinear manner (an aspect Mbembe calls entanglement). The majority of the chapter takes the form of an economic analysis of colonial and postcolonial history, examining how the government has become an instrument for transforming public good into private gain. Two points raised are the relations between salary, citizenship and clientelism in Africa: under certain regimes of arbitrariness, the salary is tied to government allegiance. The second point is that an instrumentalization of violence exists in the postcolony (which appears to be attempting a new form of legitimate domination); struggles against these forms of violence end up being reproductions of disorder rather than steps towards democracy. ‚ÄúOn Private Indirect Government‚Äù was translated by A. M. Berrett.  The Aesthetics of Vulgarity  In this chapter, Mbembe examines the \\"banality of power\\" through the case study of Cameroon. The phrase \\"banality of power\\" refers both to the multiplication and routinization of bureaucratic and arbitrary rules and to elements of the obscene and grotesque (in the terminology of Mikhail Bakhtin) intrinsic in systems of domination. It explores \\"the complex interplay of consent and coercion in the postcolony and the carnivalesque disposition of both rulers and ruled in the production and maintenance of hegemonic relations of power and subversion.\\" The chapter was originally published under the name ‚ÄúProvisional Notes on the Postcolony‚Äù in the academic journal Africa and ‚ÄúThe Banality of Power and the Aesthetics of Vulgarity in the Postcolony‚Äù in Public Culture, both in 1992. It was translated into English by Janet Roitman and Murray Last, with Mbembe's assistance. The earlier versions of the chapter have together been cited over 1000 times, according to Google Scholar.  The Thing and Its Doubles  This chapter is a study of the \\"thing\\" ‚Äì the ‚ÄúFather‚Äù or autocrat ‚Äì and its representation in Cameroonian cartoons of the 1990s. The cartoons were published following a wave of protests known as \\"Operation Ghost Towns\\" which resulted in a period of authoritarian softening in 1991. In his essay, Mbembe establishes the context of the cartoon images and spells out their anthropological status and effectiveness. He then shows how as a crude cartoon, \\"the autocrat acts as both text and pretext for a general commentary on power in the postcolony\\" and commentary on the history of the immediate present (written as hallucination, through the form of the cartoon). This chapter, along with \\"The Aesthetics of Vulgarity,\\" explores the thought of ordinary citizens about the postcolonial government. The chapter was originally published in Volume 36 of the academic journal Cahier d‚Äô√©tudes africaines (Journal of African Studies) in 1996 under the name ‚ÄúLa ‚ÄòChose‚Äô et ses doubles dans la caricature camerounaise‚Äù (The ‚ÄúThing‚Äù and Its Doubles in the Cameroonian Cartoon). It was translated into English by A. M. Berrett.  Out of the World  In this chapter, Mbembe shifts his focus to a more philosophical matter: the phenomenology of violence and death. He explores the forms through which death and violence are accomplished in present-day Africa and how the violence of death comes to encompass all spheres of life. Two main issues are considered: first, the burden of the arbitrariness involved in killing what has been already defined as nothingness ‚Äì an empty figure ‚Äì and second, the way the negated and disempowered subject takes on the act of their own destruction during death. The chapter was translated into English by A. M. Berrett.  God's Phallus  The final chapter of On the Postcolony takes a philosophical and theological approach to analysis of the \\"divine libido\\" - the emanation of a bio-psychic energy located chiefly in sexuality. The ‚ÄúPhallus‚Äù of the chapter's title refers to the form of the colonial power. Mbembe's analysis leads him to three conclusions: first, that \\"the phantasm of power consist[s] in rubbing the two imaginaries of death and sexuality together... [and] domination consists in sharing the same phantasms,\\" second, that conversion means to be spoken through by a god (an act of erotic intercourse), and finally, that \\"to produce religious truth, faith and a certain stupefaction must overlap.\\" Mbembe has described this chapter as \\"an allegoric dialogue with Frantz Fanon... it suggests that in order to exit the Fanonian cul-de-sac ‚Äî the dead-end of the generalised circulation and exchange of death as the condition for becoming human ‚Äî it is important to examine in what way, in a context of a life that is so precarious, disposing-of-death- itself could be, in fact, the core of a veritable politics of freedom.\\" The chapter was translated into English by Steven Rendall.  Conclusion: The Final Matter  Mbembe ties up the book by returning to and bringing the analysis of the six chapters to bear on the original question: Who is the modern African? Is \\"an ex-slave\\" a true answer to this question? (\\"Slave\\" being defined as one on whom another claims the right to exercise their will). What remains of the African quest for self-determination ‚Äì what is Africa today? He concludes with a suggestion that, in order to live as complete people, we must learn to exist in \\"uncertainty, chance, irreality, even absurdity.\\" The chapter was translated into English by Steven Rendall.  Critical reception  Critical reception of On the Postcolony has been overwhelmingly positive, with scholars praising Mbembe's analysis while offering their own contributions to the arguments presented. Academics including Ato Quayson, Bruce Janz, Adeleke Adeeko, Judith Butler, Stephen Ellis, Tejumola Olayinan, Jeremy Weate, Rita Barnard, Carola Lentz, Catherine Coquery-Vidrovitch, and Mikael Karlstrom have published their perspectives on Mbembe's book since it was released in 2001. Ghanaian intellectual Ato Quayson of the University of Toronto calls the book ‚Äúa masterpiece of rhetorical and discursive styles‚Ä¶ as much a philosophical treatise on questions of power as such as it is about African politics and political economy.‚Äù He praises how Mbembe ‚Äúset[s] up a peculiarly rich variety of perspectival modulations‚Äù which shed light on the four main difficulties regarding discourse about Africa: defining the audience for a discussion of Africa, navigating ‚Äúthe particular philosophical prisms through which any discussion of Africa has to situate itself,‚Äù avoiding the ‚Äúcurious refraction of assumptions [which] comes to shape one's own statements,‚Äù and establishing ‚Äúa manner in which to detail Africa not as a stable identity, but as itself a field of intersecting transitional realities moving at different rates of progress.‚Äù According to Quayson, the light that On the Postcolony sheds on these problems ‚Äúmak[es] it a landmark text not just in terms of the thematic of African colonial and postcolonial realities, but more significantly, about the forms through which this thematic is to be methodologically refracted.‚Äù In his view, Mbembe's approach to the framing of Africa offers a way out of the traditional impasse of framing Africa which avoids the blind optimism of Afrocentricity as well as the hopelessness of Afro-pessimism; therein lies the book's genius and its significance. The University of Central Florida's Bruce Janz praises Mbembe's rethinking the essentialist, post-structuralist, and \\"disciplinary\\" approaches to theorizing Africa and his ‚Äúhinting at a fourth way, one which does not ignore the strengths of any of the three I have already mentioned, but tries to overcome the‚Ä¶ limitations of each.‚Äù He appreciates Mbembe's analyses of time and nothingness to travel from the ‚Äúpositive vision of African existence‚Äù with which the book begins to the position that ‚Äúlearning to enjoy as complete men and women‚Ä¶ [requires] living and existing in uncertainty, chance, irreality, even absurdity.\\" However, while praising Mbembe's analysis, Janz notes that ‚Äúhints of something transformative are hardly developed at all‚Äù; the book is excellent description but does not explain what can be done to overcome the challenges it elucidates. Another confusion, in Janz's view, is ‚Äúthat [Mbembe] announces early on that the issue at stake is the construction of the subject for him/herself, and then it seems to drop from the agenda.‚Äù Catherine Coquery-Vidrovitch of Paris Diderot University calls Mbembe's writing ‚Äúsuperb‚Äù and his analysis ‚Äúsevere and uncontestable,‚Äù yet wonders why Mbembe ‚Äúhardly makes any references, except in a brief note, to modern African philosophers criticizing the ethno-philosophy movement‚Äù as he does, such as Paulin Hountondji, Valentin Mudimbe, and B√©chir Soule√Ømane Diagne. ‚ÄúNor does he subscribe, without really clarifying the reasons, to the problematics of ‚Äòpostcoloniality‚Äô as discussed by the Subaltern Studies that he nevertheless knows very well,‚Äù she continues. Coquery-Vidrovitch concludes that ‚Äú[Mbembe's] analysis has the merit of great intellectual coherence, even if one can reproach the author for proposing a model of general development necessarily a little disconnected from the realities and concrete alternatives on the ground.‚Äù Another concern is that Mbembe‚Äôs work veers into Afro-pessimism (a charge that Mbembe declares ‚Äúinaccurate‚Äù). Coquery-Vidrovitch notes nihilist accents to the book and states that ‚Äúthe tone is that of despair,‚Äù giving Africa ‚Äúa desperate image.‚Äù Adeleke Adeeko, in a review published in the academic journal West African Review, states that although he initially had the same concern, after thinking deeply about the society depicted in Chinua Achebe‚Äôs Anthills of the Savannah, he realized that Mbembe‚Äôs philosophy was realist rather than pessimist. In other critiques, anthropologists like Carola Lentz object to what they see as Mbembe‚Äôs ‚Äúsweeping generalizations,‚Äù and philosopher and gender theorist Judith Butler further analyzes the sexual politics of power explored in ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs Phallus.‚Äù In perhaps the most-harshly worded critique, British philosopher Jeremy Weate, writing in the journal African Identities, critiques the textual approach of On the Postcolony and of postcolonial theory more broadly. He argues that postcolonial theory is ‚Äúpresently trapped within a self-referential inscriptive paradigm‚Äù that cannot recognize non-textual phenomena. On the Postcolony lacks a coherent and clearly defined theoretical position, he maintains, instead occupying ‚Äúan ambiguous (and ambivalent) space somewhere between post-structuralism and existential phenomenology‚Äù which results in a ‚Äútheoretically confused‚Äù project ‚Äúdevoid of productive existential engagement.‚Äù Weate also takes issue with what he sees as Mbembe's erasure of intellectual predecessors and contemporaries (like Hountondji), which he traces partly to ‚Äúan overreliance on a specific understanding of the intellectual‚Äù which erases everyday and grassroots resistance and results in an attempt to ‚Äútheoris[e]... effectively from a blank slate.‚Äù Although Weate concedes that On the Postcolony‚Äôs ‚Äúpartially occluded phenomenological/Deleuzian influence‚Äù provides a path forward for critical theory, he ultimately condemns the book as ‚Äúdoomed to failure‚Äù because ‚Äúit commits the double error of attempting to erase the past completely, as well as not providing any substantive ground for further development.‚Äù In a response published in the same journal, Mbembe describes Weate's critique as ‚Äúprobably one of the least imaginative and most misleading rejoinders to the book,‚Äù disputing Weate's assertions and philosophical understanding of his book.  Scholarly Impact  On the Postcolony is one of the most influential modern works on African theory: according to Google Scholar, it has been cited over 3,600 times by other academics (a standard used in the field of citation analysis to assess an article or book's impact). The ‚Äúsecond generation‚Äù ‚Äì works citing On the Postcolony ‚Äì have themselves been cited over 35,000 times in the past two decades, indicating the book's wide diffusion across the academy. The works influenced by On the Postcolony span the fields of African studies, philosophy, anthropology, sociology, political science, and critical theory, and include Ferguson‚Äôs Global Shadows: Africa in the Neoliberal World Order and Puar‚Äôs Terrorist Assemblages: Homonationalism in Queer Times. As a comparison, 82% of articles in the humanities are never cited at all and among the remaining 18%, the vast majority receive under five citations. Among all papers published in the Social Sciences in 2001, the 1% most-cited were those with over 66 citations. With its 3,660 citations as of January 2017 (4,722 if citations from the earlier versions of ‚ÄúThe Aesthetics of Vulgarity‚Äù are included), On the Postcolony is thus an extreme anomaly.

In mid-January 2017, several parts of Visayas and Mindanao experienced flooding as a result of a low-pressure area, combined with the tail-end of a cold front. Causes Impact The city of Cagayan de Oro was seriously affected by the floods, as the heavy rain started in the early afternoon and continued late into the evening on Monday, January 16, inundating several streets and stranding many commuters. Hundreds of students were trapped at the University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines (USTP) due to the floodwaters without any food or water. With most of the campus flooded, students were forced to head to the upper floors of the school's buildings. Shopping malls along Claro M. Recto Avenue were hit by the floodwaters as well; Limketkai Center was rendered completely impassable. One mall's basement parking area was filled with water, while another mall near Bitan-ag Creek was also flooded, despite the area already being elevated. As a result of the heavy rain in Cagayan de Oro, parts of Camaman-an, Patag, Carmen, and a number of urban barangays were swamped by the deluge. Two landslides were reported in the city; one on Masterson Avenue near Pryce Plaza Hotel, and in Paglaum Village, Camaman-an. The City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Department (CDRRMD) said that a rain gauge near the Cagayan River recorded a total of 166.2 mm, about 20 mm less than the amount of rainfall recorded in December 2011 when Tropical Storm Sendong (Washi) impacted the city. However, the two-day rainfall amount was higher than that from both Tropical Depression Agaton (Lingling) and Tropical Storm Seniang (Jangmi). Numerous business establishments and schools opened their doors to people unable to return home because of the floods. This included Centrio Mall, SM City Cagayan de Oro and Limketkai Mall which remained open after hours, and Xavier University, which made its canteen, a number of classrooms and covered courts as a temporary refuge. Floods also affected the provinces of Bohol, Cebu, Negros Oriental, Misamis Oriental, Lanao del Sur and Bukidnon. Landslides were also reported in several parts of Visayas and Mindanao. Classes were suspended in Tacloban, Leyte, Southern Leyte, and Misamis Oriental, as well as parts of Samar, Northern Samar, Eastern Samar provinces. Aftermath The local government of Cagayan de Oro declared a state of calamity over the city in the early morning of Tuesday, January 17, 2017. On Thursday, January 19, as a result of the continuous rainfall, the Cagayan de Oro City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (CDRRMO) declared a code yellow, asking residents to be vigilant. At least seven people died in the city due to the floods. A few days after the floods, it was reported that supplies of doxycycline, used to treat people against leptospirosis, had run out in Cagayan de Oro. A similar situation occurred in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Sendong when 24 people died because of an outbreak of leptospirosis. According to Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) secretary Mark Villar, the agency will ask the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) for an additional P300 million for the accelerated completion of various projects that are meant to reduce future flooding in Cagayan de Oro. Meanwhile, the DPWH was called into question by Senate President Aquilino Pimentel III for a lack of coordination with the City Government of Cagayan de Oro when implementing projects. The agency also admitted that the recently completed bridge over Bitan-ag Creek failed to prevent neck-level floodwaters from inundating Limketkai Center and USTP. Due to garbage clogging the creek, mud and water spilled onto Claro M. Recto Avenue.

The Bitcoin Core client, from which Bitcoin Unlimited is forked, has a hard coded one megabyte block limit; Bitcoin Unlimited differs by allowing users to signal which block size limit they prefer, find the limit having a majority consensus and automatically track the largest proof-of-work, regardless of block size. However, if a block greater than one megabyte in size is accepted by Bitcoin Unlimited and rejected by nodes with a block size limit, a fork of the network will occur, resulting in two separate blockchains with Bitcoin Unlimited nodes following the chain with the largest proof-of-work. The release of Bitcoin Unlimited follows the release of Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Classic, alternative proposals which aimed to increase bitcoin's transaction capacity of around 2.5-3 transactions per second by increasing the hard-coded block size limit. As of version 1.1.0.0, Bitcoin Unlimited releases are compatible with Bitcoin Cash, a cryptocurrency that split from bitcoin and allows larger blocks. Scalability Bitcoin Unlimited is an attempt to upgrade Bitcoin Core into a client that processes bitcoin transactions into blocks with a potential maximum size greater than the Core's hard-coded limit of one megabyte. The one megabyte block size limit was added in 2010 by Satoshi Nakamoto as a temporary anti-DoS measure. This limited the maximum network capacity to about three transactions per second. Per the advocates of the change, a block size increase is needed in order to avoid a workflow bottleneck due to the number of transactions made as bitcoin adoption increases. With Bitcoin Unlimited, miners are independently able to configure the size of the blocks they will validate. Miners using Bitcoin Unlimited continue to process regular-sized blocks but as soon as a block larger than one megabyte is mined, they will follow the chain containing the most work. Per the Bitcoin Unlimited website, the scalability solution will be found at a focal point. Support Bitcoin Unlimited follows the release of Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Classic, alternative proposals on how to increase bitcoin's transaction capacity. Mining pools including Antpool. Opposition Developers of Bitcoin Core have been reluctant to increase the block size limit. BU nodes were attacked after developers brought a bug to light on 14 March 2017. The numbers of nodes hosting Unlimited fell from 780 to about 370 following the attacks, the lowest level since October, and returned to about 780 within 24 hours according to website coin.dance which tracks network data.
