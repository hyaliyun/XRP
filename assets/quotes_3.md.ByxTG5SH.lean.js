However, actors face rule-based constraints provided by the institutional environment which influence their behaviour. Rational Choice Institutionalism arose initially from the study of congressional behaviour in the U.S. in the late 1970s.Hall, P. A., & Taylor, R. (1996). Political Science and the Three Institutionalisms. Political Studies, 44, 936-957 It employs analytical tools borrowed from neo-classical economics to explain how institutions are created, the behaviour of political actors within it, and the outcome of strategic interaction. RCI explains the creation of institutions as an attempt to reduce transaction costs of collective activity which would be significantly higher without such institutions.Williamson, Oliver (1985) The Economic Institutions of Capitalism, New York, Free Press Institutions persist after their creation because they reduce uncertainty and allow gains from exchange. Rational Choice Institutionalism assumes that political actors within the institutional setting have a fixed set of preferences. To maximize those preferences actors behave highly instrumental through systematic foresight and strategic cost-benefit calculation.Shepsle, K. (2005). Rational Choice Instituionalism. Harvard University Press. Institutions lay down the 'rules of the game', define the range of available strategies and the sequence of alternatives. The actors' behaviour will be highly influenced by the expectation how other players will bargain. The institutional environment provides information and enforcement mechanism that reduce uncertainty for each actor about the corresponding behaviour of others.Hall, P. A., & Taylor, R. (1996). Political Science and the Three Institutionalisms. Political Studies, 44, 936-957 This 'calculus approach' explains how the institutional setting influences individual behaviour and stresses how strategic interaction determines policy outcomes. Georgetown University political scientist Erik Voeten writes that the strength of RCI approaches to institutions is that they allow \\"us to think about what institutions should look like if they were designed to optimally improve cooperation. This provides a normative benchmark.\\" He argues that alternative perspectives cannot compete with RCI in terms of \\"its range of testable and generalizable implications.\\"  Definition of institutions  RCI scholars tend to define institutions as \\"rules of the game\\". These rules structure the incentives of actors, and thus alters their behavior. One prominent RCI definition of institutions is provided by Jack Knight who defines institutions as: > sets of rules that structure social interactions in particular ways. These > rules (1) provide information about how people are expected to act in > particular situations, (2) can be recognized by those who are members of the > relevant group as the rules to which others conform in these situations, and > (3) structure the strategic choices of actors in such a way as to produce > equilibrium outcomes.  Explanations for suboptimal institutions  The Principal-Agent Model A key concept of Rational Choice Institutionalism is the principal-agent model borrowed from Neo-classical economics. This model is used to explain why some institutions appear to be inefficient, suboptimal, dysfunctional or generally go against the intentions of the actors who created the institution. The concept assumes that the principal enters into a contractual relation with a second party, the agent, and delegates responsibility to the latter to fulfil certain responsibilities or a set of tasks on behalf of the principal. Problems occur due to an asymmetric distribution of information which favours the agent. The latter enables the agent to pursue its own interest and engage in opportunistic behaviour – shirking - at the cost of the principal's interest.Kiewiet, D.R. and McCubbins, M.D. (1991) The Logic of Delegation: Congressional Parties and the Appropriations Process, Chicago: University of Chicago Press. The principal's problem is how to control and limit shirking by the agent.  Domestic politics  RCI scholars may also argue that international institutional dysfunction may stem from domestic politics, as governments use these institutions both to solve problems between states but also to achieve domestic political outcomes. Limitations Rational Choice Institutionalism is frequently contrasted with Historical Institutionalism and Sociological Institutionalism. Historical Institutionalism emphasizes how small events and accidents may create paths from which it is hard to turn back from. Examining the actors involved in creating an institution and the contexts that they were operating in may provide better explanations for why particular institutions were created. Critical junctures – which can be small events and accidents – may lead to institutional change or set institutions on paths from which it is hard to turn back from. This is in contrast to Rational Choice Institutionalism where the creation of institutions, as well as institutional change, reflects optimal and efficient outcomes for actors. Historical institutionalists would rebut that by noting that many institutions are inefficient, and that these inefficiencies can be better explained through path dependency. Both sociological institutionalism and historical institutionalism would argue against the suggestion that we can assume that actors have exogenous preferences (the notion that we can assume the preferences of actors). They would argue actors do not have stable and consistent preferences, and that scholars cannot assume that they hold a given set of preferences. As a consequence, these other approaches argue that it is unreasonable to assume that a Pareto-optimal equilibrium solution exists to collective action problems. William H. Riker, a political scientist prominent for his application of game theory and mathematics in political science, argued that a key problem with RCI scholarship was the so-called \\"inherability problem\\", which referred to an inability to distinguish whether outcomes resulted from institutions or from the preferences of actors, which made it impossible to predict optimal outcomes. Terry Moe argues that RCI neglects to consider the ways in which political institutions differ from other institutions, and that RCI neglects the role of power in shaping outcomes. In other words, Moe argues that RCI accounts of political institutions as structures of voluntary cooperation, mutual gains and solutions to collective action problems are unrealistic. Historical institutionalists make a similar critique as they argue that politics is shaped by policy feedbacks and path dependencies which mean that past policies cement or increase power asymmetries, which shapes the kinds of outcomes that are possible in the future. Rational Choice Institutionalism is a deductive approach which relies on theoretical model building to explain real world policy outcomes. Therefore, due to its foundation on abstraction and clear lines of reasoning, it oversimplifies human motivation and interaction. In the context of Latin American politics, Kurt Weyland has argued that Rational Choice Institutionalism is overly focused on politics as it is conducted in legislative institutions and elections, as well as the formal rules and formal institutions of politics. He also argues that it insufficiently accounts for political change and crises, and overly focuses on microfoundations. In an influential article (and later book), George Washington University political scientists Michael Barnett and Martha Finnemore argue rationalist accounts of institutions (such as those emphasizing principal-agent problems) cannot fully account for institutional pathologies. They provide a sociological institutionalist account of institutional dysfunction whereby institutions have powers derived from their rational-legal authority, and that these powers and autonomy may give rise to suboptimal outcomes. Alexander Wendt has argued that rationalist accounts of institutional design often lack falsifiability: it is not clear how one would demonstrate that an institution was not rationally designed. Alexander Wendt and Paul Pierson have also argued if actors are guided by a logic of appropriateness, rather than a logic of consequence, then the institutions that they design are not truly optimal.

Greg Davis (vocals, guitar) formed the band in early 1983 with the original line-up of Ron Botelho (upright bass, bass), Hermann Senac (drums, vocals). Annette Zilinskas (vocals, guitar) joined the summer of 1983.Strong, Martin C. (2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, , p. 231 They released three albums, one EP and songs on one compilation before that lineup broke up in 1987.Bush, John \\"Blood on the Saddle Biography\\", Allmusic, retrieved 2010-12-18 Band leader Greg Davis continued the band to present day, with one break to work with The Vandals and Candye Kane. Eventually the band recorded for two more EPs and six more albums, getting three of them out officially, which were released in 1993, 1995, and 2001, respectively. A fourth album, The Mud, the Blood & the Beer, was recorded in 2008 and released to all digital platforms in 2020. A fifth album, True Blood, was recorded in 2013, and has since been put out in 2019 on all digital platforms. History Blood on the Saddle began as a musical idea in 1981 while Greg Davis was playing guitar in a Hollywood punk rock band called Dead Hippie. He saw Gun Club play with the Cramps and X and was inspired by their intense fusion of Delta blues with punk rock. He met Annette Zilinskas at a Blasters gig and they began singing Johnny Cash-June Carter style duets together. Annette was playing bass in a 60's band called the Bangs and they used to listen to DJ Rodney Bingenheimer play their respective bands on his KROQ radio show. In 1982 Greg moved to New Orleans and played Dobro in a Bluegrass duo on Bourbon Street while Annette continued to play bass in the ever more successful Bangs. Greg then stayed in Nashville for awhile absorbing traditional Country music in the lower Broad district before moving back to Hollywood to form a band whose purpose was to violently fuse traditional American music with punk rock.Strong, Martin C. (2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, , p. 231 In early 1983, Davis began rehearsing at Hully Gully studio with Ron Botelho on upright bass and Hermann Senac on drums and vocals. It was Hermann's idea to name the band after the traditional Cowboy song that an animatronic bear named Big Al sang in the Country Bear Jamboree at Disneyland. They started playing shows as a trio while Annette Zilinskas was on tour in the re-named Bangles. When she returned she joined Greg singing in the band. In summer 1983 the Bangles signed to CBS while Annette chose to sing and also play guitar and harmonica in Blood on the Saddle. They played more and more shows around Los Angeles while KROQ played their songs on the radio. In early 1984, the band contributed two songs to the Enigma Records compilation album Hell Comes To Your House. This was followed by their self-titled debut album Blood On The Saddle on the Minutemen's New Alliance label, produced in part by Chris D. of the Flesheaters. Greg and Annette signed a publishing deal with Peer/Southern and the band spent the rest of the year touring America and Canada. In 1985, Blood on the Saddle was provisionally signed to MCA Records but after six months their demo was rejected. The band continued playing shows in California while recording their second album Poison Love. This was released in Spring 1986 on Chameleon in North America, Stiff and New Rose Records in the U.K. and Europe, respectively. This was followed by tours of America, Canada, the U.K. and Europe for the rest of 1986. A second album, Poison Love, was finally released in early 1986, on the U.S. based Chameleon label and the New Rose label in Europe . In early 1987, the band recorded with engineer/producer Dan Matovina and Ethan James what was to be the original lineup's third and last album Fresh Blood. This was released in North America and on New Rose in Europe, but the band had broken up by that time. Disappointing sales led to the band breaking up, with Davis forming a new band The Drivers and Senac joining The Loafin' Hyenas followed by Crowbar Salvation and The Guilty Hearts. Botelho next worked with Bobbi Bratt.Hochman, Steve & Spurrier, Jeff (1987). \\"Local Heroes Do Their Anti-Nuke Bits\\", Los Angeles Times, November 29, 1987, p. 92. Davis continued to perform with Blood on the Saddle, bringing in varying lineups of musicians, including former Stains/DC3 bassist Ceasar Viscarra and drummer Dave Shollenbarger (Steve Jones), with the band splitting in late 1988. Blood on the Saddle was on hiatus in 1989 and 1990 while Greg played as a tour guitar player for So Cal punk rock band The Vandals, then a run with Country-Swing singer Candye Kane. In 1990, Davis formed a new lineup of Blood on the Saddle with Chris Engel (bass) and Danny Rickard (drums). Engel died in 1991. In 1992 Greg recruited drummer John Stephenson ( Nip Drivers) and then Michael Hately on bass. In 1992 bass player Caeser Viscarra re-joined the band for shows in Los Angeles. In 1993, with drummer Eric Davis and bassist Billy Koepke (Legal Weapon, Tex and the Horseheads) the band recorded their fourth album More Blood. It was released in Europe on Schemer Records/ a subsidiary label of Semaphore Records. The band toured in Europe to promote it. In 1994, bassist John Stephenson and drummer Dave Frappier rejoined the band and they spent reveal months touring in Europe. An EP of songs was recorded in Los Angeles and released as 4 Song 7 EP followed by the songs on the Some Songs various artists compilation, both released on the Kill Rock Stars label. In August 1994, while in Europe, they recorded in Amsterdam what was to be their fifth album titled New Blood with the EP songs added. In 1995, this was released and distributed in Europe by Last Call Records along with a release by Rebel Records in Germany. The line-up then toured Europe again in late 1994 and 1995. In 1997, bassist Ed Marshall joined the band and they contributed four songs to the German label One Million Dollar Records compilation album entitled It Came From the Barn. Jose Levato (Top Jimmy and the Rhythm Pigs) played bass live for the remainder of 1998 and 1999. In 1999, an album Flesh & Blood was recorded by the lineup of Greg Davis, Dave Frappier and Ed Marshall; released in 2001 on CD and vinyl by One Million Dollar Records out of Germany. In 2001 and 2002, Blood on the Saddle toured Europe again with new bassist/vocalist Kevin Keller. In 2002, original vocalist Annette Zilinskas did several shows with the band in the U.S. In 2005, the band recorded tracks for a currently unreleased album Blood Alcohol, with a planned digital release in 2020. In 2006, original vocalist Annette Zilinskas did more shows with the band in the U.S. In 2007 bassist Al Garcia joined the band and in 2008 they toured the West Coast to Canada and back and in 2008 they recorded an album The Mud, the Blood and the Beer, but it was unreleased at the time. In 2009, there was no band activity. In 2010, Greg Davis re-constituted the band with bassist/ vocalist Robby Tavares and drummer Eddie Rojas. In 2012 new drummer Keith Comey joined the band and in 2013 they recorded their ninth album True Blood in Oceanside California with Thomas Yearsley (the Paladins) producing. It was officially released on all digital platforms in 2019. In 2018, the band was re-constituted with former drummer David Frappier and former bassist John Stephenson. Bassist Ceaser Viscarra then returned in 2019 to be followed by bassist Al Garcia at present. In 2019, the first three Blood on the Saddle albums; the 1995 album New Blood and the latest recording from 2012 True Blood were all released on all digital platforms. In 2020, the previously unreleased album The Mud, the Blood & the Beer was released on all digital platforms.

Serenity was originally surveyed as part of the Smithsonian's Save Outdoor Sculpture! survey in 1993. Description This large sculpture is of an allegorical woman wearing long, flowing classical robes which are tied at her waist. She has long hair and stares intensely in front of her. \\"Serenity\\" sits on a rocky ledge with her arms casually resting on the rocks behind her. Her left foot rested on a broken sword. The sculpture is signed on the proper left side: Jose Clara. The front of the base is inscribed: :SERENITY :IN REMEMBRANCE OF WILLIAM HENRY SCHEVTZE :LIEVTENANT COMMANDER VNITED STATES NAVY :MDCCCLIII–MCMII The name of William Henry Schuetze is spelled wrong on the monument per a government source at the time. The statue is an outstanding example of the avantgarde classical style, which became popular in Europe and the US around 1910, following the work of French sculptor Aristide Maillol (1861–1944). Serenity's classical features and its archaic volumes are characteristics of this style, which became particularly important in Catalonia, where Clarà was born, through the Noucentista movement, spanning from 1910 to 1936. Background Serenity was bought by Charles Deering in Sitges, a town near Barcelona, Spain. Deering had a unique art collection that included many works by Catalan artists. In 1916 he commissioned sculptor Josep Clarà i Ayats (1878–1958) to sculpt a version of Serenity for the main patio of his villa in Sitges, known as Palau de Maricel. However, later changes in the building forced Deering to change his mind so to locate the statue at Meridian Hill Park as a tribute to his friend and classmate from the U.S. Naval Academy – William Henry Scheutze (1853–1902). The sculpture was dedicated on March 12, 1924.Statue Is a Curious Homage to Naval Officer, Answer Man Finds, by John Kelly, Washington Post Sunday, March 22, 2009 Schuetze was a naval officer from the academy who graduated in 1873 and went on to serve as a navigator on the U.S.S. Iowa during the Spanish–American War. He was active in the U.S. Naval White Squadron in Chicago. Earlier in his naval career (1882-84), as mentioned in President Chester A. Arthur's second State of the Union address (also with Schuetze misspelled per that linked source), he was a lieutenant on missions in the aftermath of the disastrous Jeannette expedition in the Arctic Ocean. Before his death in 1927, Schuetze became president of the International Harvester Company. The sculpture is similar to the one located at the Miramar Gardens in Montjuïc, Barcelona. The Museu de la Garrotxa d'Olot holds other versions of this work. Condition When the sculpture was installed at Meridian Hill Park in 1925, the public opposed it. A petition was created opposing its placement, citing that the subject's \\"thighs were too big.\\" Community members took hammers to the sculpture, creating small craters, which remain today, on the woman's face. In 1960 the piece was reported as having a missing nose.Clark, Elizabeth G. \\"Report of the Chronicler\\" Records of the Columbia Historical Society, Washington, D.C. Vol. 60/62. p. 381. This sculpture was surveyed in 1993 for its condition and it was described as needing treatment. By 2009, press reports indicate it was also missing her left hand and a big toe. As of 2018, one of the sculpture's hands is missing.

Eliza Doolittle is a fictional character and the protagonist in George Bernard Shaw's play Pygmalion (1913) and its 1956 musical adaptation, My Fair Lady. Eliza (from Lisson Grove, London) is a Cockney flower girl, who comes to Professor Henry Higgins asking for elocution lessons, after a chance encounter at Covent Garden. Higgins goes along with it for the purposes of a wager: That he can turn her into the toast of elite London society. Her Cockney dialect includes words that are common among working class Londoners, such as ain't; \\"I ain't done nothing wrong by speaking to the gentleman\\" said Doolittle. Doolittle receives voice coaching and learns the rules of etiquette. The outcome of these attentions varies between the original play and the various adaptations (see the Pygmalion article). History The part of Eliza was originally played by Mrs Patrick Campbell, at that time the most famous actress on London's West End stage. Shaw had written the role for her, and although many considered her too old for the role she triumphed.Huggett, Richard (1969). The Truth About Pygmalion. p. 20-27. Random House. The unprecedented use of the word \\"bloody\\" - as a scripted intensive - caused a sensation when Campbell delivered it. For the 1938 film Pygmalion, George Bernard Shaw personally requested the young English actress Wendy Hiller play Doolittle, a part she had previously played on stage opposite Leslie Howard as Higgins. Her performance served as the definitive film portrayal until Audrey Hepburn played the role in the highly successful 1964 film musical My Fair Lady. Julie Andrews originated the musical version of Doolittle on stage in My Fair Lady, with Rex Harrison as Higgins. Sally Ann Howes took the role of Eliza Doolittle in 1958 when Julie Andrews left. Harrison went on to reprise his role in the 1964 film alongside Audrey Hepburn as Doolittle. At the 37th Academy Awards, the award for Best Actress went to Andrews for her performance as Mary Poppins. Hepburn was not nominated. Despite this, many critics greatly applauded Hepburn's \\"exquisite\\" performance.Audrey Hepburn Obituary.

She is Eliza for the ages,\\"Ringgold, Gene. \\"My Fair Lady – the finest of them all!\\", Soundstage, December 1964 while adding, \\"Everyone agreed that if Julie Andrews was not to be in the film, Audrey Hepburn was the perfect choice.\\" Martine McCutcheon played the role in the 2001 London revival of My Fair Lady. Despite missing many performances (citing health problems), having to have various understudies perform the role and withdrawing nearly five months early from the production's transfer to the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, she won the award for best actress in a musical at the 2002 Laurence Olivier Awards. One of the understudies was then-unknown \\"First Lady of the West End\\" Kerry Ellis. Lauren Ambrose played the role in the 2018 Lincoln Center Theater revival of My Fair Lady on Broadway, a performance for which she was nominated for the 2018 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical and won the 2018 Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Actress in a Musical.

Aikido training is based primarily on two partners practicing pre-arranged forms (kata) rather than freestyle practice. The basic pattern is for the receiver of the technique (uke) to initiate an attack against the person who applies the technique—the 取り tori, or shite , (depending on aikido style) also referred to as ( nage (when applying a throwing technique), who neutralises this attack with an aikido technique. Both halves of the technique, that of uke and that of tori, are considered essential to aikido training. Both are studying aikido principles of blending and adaptation. Tori learns to blend with and control attacking energy, while uke learns to become calm and flexible in the disadvantageous, off-balance positions in which tori places him. This \\"receiving\\" of the technique is called ukemi. Uke continuously seeks to regain balance and cover vulnerabilities (e.g., an exposed side), while tori uses position and timing to keep uke off-balance and vulnerable. In more advanced training, uke may apply to regain balance and pin or throw tori. refers to the act of receiving a technique. Good ukemi involves attention to the technique, the partner and the immediate environment - it is an active rather than a passive \\"receiving\\" of Aikido. The fall itself is part of Aikido, and is a way for the practitioner to receive, safely, what would otherwise be a devastating strike or throw (or joint lock control) and return to a standing position in one fluid movement. The person throwing (or applying other technique) must take into account the ukemi ability of his partner, as well as the physical space: walls, weapons (wooden tantō, bokken, jō) on the tatami, and the aikido practitioners nearby. Uke must attack with a strength and speed appropriate to the skill level of the tori; in the case of beginners, this means an attack of far less severity than would be encountered in a real-life self-defense situation. Training techniques * / Japanese martial arts terms Two Cranes Aikido, Seattle, Washington teaches movement from the hip rather than relying on muscle strength of the arms * trains students to enter with both arms forward in the tegatana (手刀) position. * altering the direction of an incoming attack * / / breathing is important in the execution of all aikido techniques. Here \\"breathing\\" has an additional meaning of \\"match with\\" or \\"accord,\\" as the efforts of tori must agree with the direction and strength with which his wrists are held by uke. Initial attacks strikes resemble attacks with a sword Aikido techniques are usually a defense against an attack; therefore, to practice aikido with their partner, students must learn to deliver various types of attacks. Although attacks are not studied as thoroughly as in striking-based disciplines such as karate or boxing, \\"honest\\" or \\"sincere\\" attacks (a strong strike or an immobilizing grab) are needed to study correct and effective application of technique. Many of the of aikido are often said to resemble cuts from a sword or other grasped object, which indicates its origins in techniques intended for armed combat. Other techniques, which appear to explicitly be punches (tsuki), are also practiced as thrusts with a knife or sword. Kicks are generally reserved for upper-level variations; reasons cited include that falls from kicks are especially dangerous, and that kicks (high kicks in particular) were uncommon during the types of combat prevalent in feudal Japan. Some basic strikes include: * a vertical knifehand strike to the head. In training, this is usually directed at the forehead or the crown for safety, but more dangerous versions of this attack target the bridge of the nose and the maxillary sinus. * a diagonal knifehand strike to the side of the head or neck. * a punch to the torso. Specific targets include the chest, abdomen, and solar plexus. Same as , and . * a punch to the face. Same as . * Being attacked with a sword or bokken, usually reserved for upper level practitioners. * Being attacked with a tantō, usually a wooden one. * Being attacked with a jō . Being attacked by any wooden staff is called bōtori(棒取り) or tsuetori(杖取り) Beginners in particular often practice techniques from grabs, both because they are safer and because it is easier to feel the energy and lines of force of a hold than a strike. Some grabs are historically derived from being held while trying to draw a weapon; a technique could then be used to free oneself and immobilize or strike the attacker who is grabbing the defender. * one hand grabs one wrist. * both hands grab one wrist. Same as * both hands grab both wrists. Same as . * a shoulder grab. \\"Both-shoulders- grab\\" is . It is sometimes combined with an overhead strike as . * grabbing the (clothing of the) chest. Same as . Techniques  Diagram of ikkyō, or \\"first technique\\". Yonkyō has a similar mechanism of action, although the upper hand grips the forearm rather than the elbow. When all attacks are considered, aikido has over 10,000 nameable techniques. Many aikido techniques derive from Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu, but some others were invented by Morihei Ueshiba. The precise terminology for some may vary between organisations and styles; what follows are the terms used by the Aikikai Foundation. (Note that despite the names of the first five techniques listed, they are not universally taught in numeric order.) Several techniques (e.g. the \\"drop\\" throws) are also shared with judo, which can be considered a \\"cousin\\" of aikido due to their shared jujutsu background. * ude osae (arm pin), a control using one hand on the elbow and one hand near the wrist which leverages uke to the ground. This grip also applies pressure into the ulnar nerve at the wrist. * kote mawashi, a pronating wristlock that torques the arm and applies painful nerve pressure. (There is an adductive wristlock or Z-lock in ura version.) * kote hineri, a rotational wristlock that directs upward-spiraling tension throughout the arm, elbow and shoulder. * kote osae, a shoulder control similar to ikkyō, but with both hands gripping the forearm. The knuckles (from the palm side) are applied to the recipient's radial nerve against the periosteum of the forearm bone. * ude nobashi, visually similar to ikkyō, but with an inverted grip of the wrist, medial rotation of the arm and shoulder, and downward pressure on the elbow. Common in knife and other weapon take- aways. * also called * an elbow lock generally used for knife thrusts or straight punches. * The hand is folded back past the shoulder, locking the shoulder joint. * a supinating wristlock-throw that stretches the extensor digitorum. * a loosely used term for various types of mechanically unrelated techniques, although they generally do not use joint locks like other techniques. Different types of kokyūnage include: :ushironage 後ろ投げ the attacker falls backwards. Known as Tai no henkō in Yoshinkan :tenkan tsugiashi 転換継ぎ足 rear pivot and then forward step :irimi tenkan 入身転換 :irimi kaiten 入身回転 :kiri otoshi 切り落し \\"cutting drop\\" :uki otoshiBarbara Britton - uki otoshi 浮き落とし \\"floating drop\\" :maki otoshiBarbara Britton Shidoin teaching maki-otoshi 巻き落とし \\"rolling-up drop\\" :hajiki goshi はじき腰 “flicking hip” :katahiki-otoshi 肩ひき落とし “shoulder pulling drop” :kata hiki hajiki goshi 肩ひきはじき腰 shoulder-pulling flicking hip :suri-otoshi すり落とし “striking drop” :tsurikomi-goshi 釣込腰 “lifting- pull hip” :tsuri-goshi 釣腰 “pulling hip” :kote-hineri koshi-nage 小手捻り腰投げ “forearm twist hip throw” * throws in which tori moves through the space occupied by uke. The classic form superficially resembles a \\"clothesline\\" technique. * beginning with ryōte-dori; moving forward, tori' sweeps one hand low (\\"earth\\") and the other high (\\"heaven\\"), which unbalances uke so that he or she easily topples over. * aikido's version of the hip throw. Tori drops his or her hips lower than those of uke, then flips uke over the resultant fulcrum. * or a throw that locks the arms against each other (The kanji for \\"10\\" is a cross-shape: 十). * tori sweeps the arm back until it locks the shoulder joint, then uses forward pressure to throw. from behind tori extends uke's arm slightly downwards and places the other arm under tori's upper arm, then moves whole body forward.  * Yoshinkan terminology The Yoshinkan school retains these Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu terms for the \\"first\\" through \\"fourth\\" techniques: # 一ケ条 Ikkajo # 二ケ条 Nikajo # 三ケ条 Sankajo # 四ケ条 Yonkajo Implementations Diagram showing two versions of the ikkyō technique: one moving forward (the omote version) and one moving backward (the ura version). See text for more details. Aikido makes use of body movement (tai sabaki) to blend with uke. For example, an \\"entering\\" (irimi) technique consists of movements inward towards uke, while a technique uses a pivoting motion. Additionally, an technique takes place in front of uke, whereas an technique takes place to his side; a technique is applied with motion to the front of uke, and a version is applied with motion towards the rear of uke, usually by incorporating a turning or pivoting motion. Finally, most techniques can be performed while in a seated posture (seiza). Techniques where both uke and tori are sitting are called suwari-waza, and techniques performed with uke standing and tori sitting are called hanmi handachi. Thus, from fewer than twenty basic techniques, there are thousands of possible implementations. For instance, ikkyō can be applied to an opponent moving forward with a strike (perhaps with an ura type of movement to redirect the incoming force), or to an opponent who has already struck and is now moving back to reestablish distance (perhaps an omote-waza version). Specific aikido kata are typically referred to with the formula \\"attack-technique(-modifier)\\". For instance, katate-dori ikkyō refers to any ikkyō technique executed when uke is holding one wrist. This could be further specified as katate-dori ikkyō omote, referring to any forward-moving ikkyō technique from that grab. Atemi () are strikes (or feints) employed during an aikido technique. Some view atemi as attacks against \\"vital points\\" meant to cause damage in and of themselves. For instance, Gōzō Shioda described using atemi in a brawl to quickly down a gang's leader. Others consider atemi, especially to the face, to be methods of distraction meant to enable other techniques. A strike, whether or not it is blocked, can startle the target and break his or her concentration. The target may also become unbalanced in attempting to avoid the blow, for example by jerking the head back, which may allow for an easier throw. Many sayings about atemi are attributed to Morihei Ueshiba, who considered them an essential element of technique.

It passes through the site of the disused Chatterley Whitfield colliery, where it was once culverted, and then flows between Bradeley and Norton-in-the-moors to Ford Green. The brook then flows to the east of Smallthorne, and Sneyd Green where it passes beneath the Caldon Canal, joining the Trent near Milton, Staffordshire.

The torpedo boat was Potemkins escort and had on board a complement of three officers, 20 sailors, two 37 mm guns and two torpedo launchers. Ismail brought rotten meat aboard Potemkin in June 1905, an incident which sparked the mutiny. The commander of Ismail was Lieutenant Pyotr Klodt von Yurgensburg, a 41-year-old Russian nobleman.Neal Bascomb, Red Mutiny, page 91 Specifications Ismail had a top speed of 25 knots and was 127 feet long and 11 feet wide.Neal Bascomb, Red Mutiny, page 48 Mutiny of Potemkin Ismail alongside Potemkin, 1905 During the mutiny of Potemkin on 14 June 1905 (according to the Western Calendar; 27 June 1905 according to the Julian Calendar), officers from the battleship swam for safety towards Ismail. Yurgensburg hesitated for 20 minutes before deciding to flee the scene, but Ismail was prevented from doing so when its mooring line became caught in the anchor. When the signalman informed Yurgensburg that his ship was being fired upon with rifles by sailors from Potemkin, he ignored a call to surrender but was eventually halted by three shots from Potemkins guns, the last damaging the Ismails funnel. Yurgensburg then surrendered without a fight. All the officers aboard Ismail were taken to Potemkin and replaced by five revolutionaries (two stokers, two machinists and a helmsman). Ismail protected the two launches and 40 sailors who took part in the funeral of the revolutionary sailor Grigory Vakulinchuk in Odessa. The vessel also acted as a go-between when the battleship briefly joined the uprising.Neal Bascomb, Red Mutiny , page 187 On 19 June (2 July in the Julian calendar) the torpedo boat accompanied Potemkin to the Romanian port of Constanța, where the battleship's Captain asked for supplies from Romanian authorities. In the first hours of the following day, while the Romanian response was yet to come, Ismail tried to enter the Romanian port, but was shot at by the Romanian cruiser Elisabeta, who fired two shots in front of the torpedo boat to warn her off: first a blank charge then an explosive charge. Ismail returned to Potemkin and anchored next to the battleship. The Romanian response came several hours later, a refusal to give any supplies to the mutineers. The two warships subsequently left the port in the afternoon of that same day.Neal Bascomb, Red Mutiny, pp. 243–255 On 23 June (6 July in the Julian Calendar) there was an attempted counter mutiny when some sailors rushed the helm, wanting to return to Sevastopol. They failed in their attempt to seize control of Ismail and the torpedo boat accompanied Potemkin to Constanţa under tow. On 24 June (7 July), only two hours from their destination, a wave severed the towline; but Ismail stayed with Potemkin until she reached the Romanian port of Constanța. Potemkin reached her destination at 23:00 on 7 July and the Romanians agreed to give asylum to the crew if they would disarm themselves and surrender the battleship. Ismails crew decided the following morning to return to Sevastopol and turn themselves in, but Potemkins crew voted to accept the terms. Captain Negru, commander of the port, came aboard at noon and hoisted the Romanian flag, then he allowed the battleship to enter the inner harbor.Neal Bascomb, Red Mutiny, pp. 286–99  References  Further reading * Bascomb, Neal.

The designations do not follow any fixed pattern. Routes 51 to 75 are listed below. County Route 51 County Route 51 is a major road running southwest- to-northeast from CR 80 to NY 24 and CR 94 in Riverside. ;Route description The road begins at CR 80 (Montauk Highway) just east of the eastern terminus of CR 98 (Frowein Road). The route runs along the west side of two local airports (Lufker Airport and Spadaro Airport) where it also crosses the former right-of-way for the Manorville Branch of the Long Island Rail Road. At NY 27 (Sunrise Highway), CR 51 is one of the roads served by the incomplete Exit 61\\\\. The other one is CR 55, which served as part of NY 27 until Sunrise Highway was extended east of the interchange. CR 51 became the northern terminus of CR 55 in the 1980s. The road continues northeast through the hills of the Long Island Pine Barrens. Soon thereafter, CR 51 reaches the intersection of Speonk–Riverhead Road (former CR 88), which leads to the Suffolk County Community College eastern campus. Northeast of that point, the road literally starts to go downhill. At Wildwood Lake, there is an incomplete at-grade interchange with CR 63 (Lake Avenue), which used to be part of East Moriches–Riverhead Road. From there, the road runs north through Cranberry Bog County Park. It curves northeast again at a plot of land that was originally intended to be the southern terminus of CR 103 (Cedar Swamp Road), then enters a series of Suffolk County Government buildings, where it finally terminates at an at-grade intersection at NY 24 and CR 94 in Riverside. ;Major intersections County Route 52 County Route 52 is a short two-lane road called Sandy Hollow Road and is a divided highway with at least one turning ramp only at both ends. The road serves as a connecting route between NY 27/CR 39 and CR 38\\\\. ;Major intersections The entire route is in Tuckahoe. County Route 53 County Route 53 was Clinton Avenue in Bay Shore. Today it serves as a southbound only suffixed route of CR 13, known as CR 13A south from the intersection of Reil Place. North of this intersection, Clinton Avenue is a string of roads running parallel to Fifth Avenue maintained by the town of Islip. County Route 54 County Route 54 is mainly Hulse Landing Road, a two-lane road that runs north and south Wading River. The northern terminus of CR 54 at the wye at Wildwood State Park. The route begins at Sound Avenue in Wading River, with Hulse Landing Road continuing south from the intersection. The road passes by a Wading River Fire Department depot and several businesses within the housing it passes through. Though Hulse Landing Road heads straight north toward Old North Country Road along the western border of Wildwood State Park, CR 54 curves northeast into Wildwood Road, the southern entrance of the park. Although there was signage at the southern terminus of Hulse Landing road at NY 25A, the portion of CR 54 between Sound Avenue and 25A has been decommissioned. The road formerly began at NY 25A near land formerly owned by the Calverton Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant. Between NY 25A and Sound Avenue the formerly proposed Nugent Drive Extension was supposed to cross over CR 54 at an interchange. The Nugent Drive Extension was intended to serve as the relocated NY 25A. Sound Avenue was to be transformed into a dead end street west of former CR 54\\\\. Today, the land intended to be used for the road is now part of a housing development. The portion of CR 54 north of Sound Avenue was designated as NY 352 from to . ;Major intersections The entire route is in Wading River. County Route 55 County Route 55 is a short county road in Suffolk County, New York, located in and around Eastport known as Eastport–Manor Road, and sometimes Eastport–Manorville Road. It runs north and south from CR 80 (Montauk Highway, formerly NY 27A) to CR 51 north of Eastport. ;History As the name implies, the road originally went from Manorville to Eastport, and was acquired by the Suffolk County Department of Public Works in 1935. The section between Montauk Highway and CR 71 (Old Country Road) was once part of Montauk Highway itself. When Sunrise Highway terminated at exit 61, NY 27 took a right turn along a temporary concurrency with CR 55 until it reached Montauk Highway, and continued eastward toward Montauk. Construction of the vast and complex exit 61 interchange forced the realignment of CR 55, as well as Head of the Neck Road. When CR 111 was built between the Long Island Expressway and Sunrise Highway during the 1970s, it replaced Eastport–Manorville Road north of the road's current terminus towards the L.I.E. However, Suffolk County Planning Department wanted to build a new extension of CR 55 north of CR 111 leading to the Grumman Calverton Airport. An interchange with the expressway was also supposed to have been built. Neither of these proposals were ever accepted. CR 55 was truncated to East Moriches–Riverhead Road in 1986, and the rest of Eastport–Manor Road fell under the jurisdiction of the Town of Brookhaven. This section is the home to the Shrine of Our Lady of The Island. ;Major intersections County Route 56 County Route 56 is a bi-directional frontage road along NY 27 known as Victory Boulevard. It stretches from CR 16 between Sunrise Highway and CR 21 and ends at William Floyd Parkway, however Victory Boulevard extends east of the CR 56 designation. At one time, it also included Horseblock Road east of Waverly Avenue in Farmingville. The beginning of CR 56 east of CR 16 at the interchange with NY 27. CR 56 provides the entrance to Southaven County Park along Carmans River, and the median of Sunrise Highway near this section contains a pine tree lined median in front of those entrances. The setting along these roads is similar to the one on the Southern State Parkway west of Belmont Lake State Park. After the intersection of River Road, a westbound on- ramp to Sunrise Highway, which was originally built with two different access points. East of the William Floyd Parkway interchange, Victory Boulevard remains a two-lane bi-directional frontage road for Sunrise Highway, but this section is a Town of Brookhaven maintained road. It skirts along the south end of the runway for Brookhaven Airport west of Winters Drive, and goes as far east as Barnes Road in Moriches. ;Major intersections County Route 57 County Route 57 runs mostly east and west from NY 231 in Deer Park to NY 27A in downtown Bay Shore. It includes Bay Shore Road, Howell's Road, and Third Avenue. ;Route description No sooner does CR 57 start at NY 231 in a sharp southeasterly direction, does it encounter Carll's Path and CR 4 (Commack Road). The intersection of Weeks Road is where the road crosses the Babylon–Islip Town Line, the southeastern angle of the road levels off, and was where the Babylon–Northport Expressway was intended to cross over, with a possible interchange. CR 82's northern terminus is at CR 57, however Udall's Road continues north of this terminus as a town of Islip Street. Howell's Road is cut off by the interchange with the Southern State Parkway. Originally it crossed Bay Shore Road, then moved along the south side and intersected with Bay Shore Road again along with Muncey Road. Besides serving exit 41 on the Southern State, it also contains on and off-ramps from the ramp between Robert Moses Causeway and Heckscher State Parkway. At the intersection of Muncey Road, CR 57 moves from Bay Shore Road to Howell's Road. From there it becomes the northern border of the village of Brightwaters. Eastbound and westbound carriageways are separated by two different underpasses beneath the interchange with NY 27 (Sunrise Highway), both of which briefly join the service roads. When the eastbound and westbound lanes merge again, the first site the encounter is The John Thomas Inne on the southeast corner of Howell's Road and the eastbound service road. At Manatuck Boulevard, the Brightwaters village line moves from the north side of CR 57 to the south side, but still runs along the road until Clinton Avenue, where CR 57 leaves Brightwaters just west of the intersection of CR 13\\\\. CR 57 turns south onto Third Avenue, where it crosses CR 50, and finally terminates at NY 27A in downtown Bay Shore. ;Major intersections County Route 57A County Route 57A was the former designation for Third Avenue south of Howell's Road towards NY 27A in Bay Shore. It became part of CR 57\\\\. County Route 57B County Route 57B was the former designation for Third Avenue north of Howell's Road to either Sunrise Highway eastbound service road, or possibly as far north as CR 13 and Brook Avenue. The road was decommissioned and is now maintained by the town of Islip. County Route 58 County Route 58, locally known as Old Country Road, serves as a northern bypass of the section of NY 25 that runs through the downtown area of Riverhead. Built through what were once relatively desolate fields, the road is now home to several large shopping centers and big box stores, and as such, has become, at least on the weekends, even more choked than the road it is supposed to bypass. ;Route description The highway starts at the sprawling junction of NY 25 and I-495, as a four-lane divided highway. The western split between NY 25 and CR 58 is entirely grade-separated with turnarounds in the median. This was built in conjunction with the interchanges with the Long Island Expressway at exits 72 and 73\\\\. After the incomplete interchange with I-495 (which would have been expanded when I-495 was extended eastward), the road quickly narrows to four lanes with a center-turn lane as it passes the large Tanger Outlet Center complex, which was built during the 1990s. Continuing eastward, the road alternates between three lanes and four lanes, always with a center turn lane. The portion of the road between the outlet center and the traffic circle at CR 73 has been the site of the most active retail development, spread over several decades. As such, the road's width and treatment vary because the task of widening largely fell to each individual developer of the new strip malls. Of course, the area is now very congested, particularly because the number of traffic lights on the road has increased from six in 1990 to 13 in 2007. After the traffic circle at CR 73, the road continues for the rest of its length with only two lanes plus the center-turn lane. It terminates at NY 25 and Doctor's Path northeast of the town of Riverhead. ;Major intersections County Route 59 CR 59 near Stephen Hands Path County Route 59 is Long Lane in the town of East Hampton. It was once proposed to be extended and serve as a realigned section of NY 114.Map of Eastern Suffolk County, New York 1941@NYCRoads.com ;Major intersections County Route 60 CR 60 in Noyack County Route 60 is a county road formerly known as CR 38A. It is a pair of two-lane roads (Noyack–Long Beach Road and Short Beach Road) that run along the peninsula connecting Noyack with North Haven. Noyack–Long Beach Road was previously known as Long and Short Beach Highway. CR 60 begins at an at-grade interchange with CR 38 in Noyack between Noyac Bay and Payne's Creek. It narrows down to a two-lane undivided highway which runs on a peninsula, with a parallel park access road on the north side and a bicycle lane on the south side. The western interchange indicates a potential proposal to widen the road to a possible four-lane divided highway that was never built. The peninsula ends in North Haven, where Noyack–Long Beach Road becomes Short Beach Road at Third Street. CR 60 ends at a traffic circle at NY 114 and Tyndall Road, although NY 114 continues in the same direction as Short Beach Road until it curves to the north and reaches the South Ferry Port to Shelter Island. ;Major intersections County Route 61 County Route 61 is unsigned Waverly Avenue, a mainly two-lane road that runs north and south along the Islip–Brookhaven town line until the town line makes a sharp left along the Greenport Branch of the Long Island Rail Road. ;Route description CR 61 begins at CR 19, in the town of Brookhaven where that section of Waverly Avenue becomes Patchogue–Holbrook Road, and Log Road becomes a dead end street. From here, road takes a northeasterly turn and straightens out along the Islip–Brookhaven town line. CR 61 is the last interchange along Woodside Avenue (CR 99) before its western terminus at Patchogue–Holbrook Road. Access is only available from Woodside Avenue; however this interchange also includes an underpass for a driveway to the Holtsville I.R.S. office. Further north, motorists will encounter the southern terminus of Blue Point Road, which until the town of Islip allowed development on the west side of the road in the mid-20th century, actually reached Blue Point. The last intersection within range of the town of Islip is for Furrow Roads (eastern terminus of CR 90) and Barretts Avenue, both of which were once intended to be integrated into the Central Suffolk Highway. Before the grade crossing of the Main Line of the Long Island Rail Road, a driveway for the former site of the Holtsville train station, can be found on the right side, while the Islip–Brookhaven town line takes a left turn to follow the tracks into Ronkonkoma, and Lakeland. After this crossing, Waverly Avenue immediately crosses Long Island Avenue, which until the mid-1970s terminated at Waverly Avenue, forcing westbound motorists to make a right turn and then a left onto Union Avenue across from the Holtsville Fire Department. Waverly Avenue crosses over the Long Island Expressway with no access other than to the service roads. However, until CR 97 (Nicolls Road) was extended to the Long Island Expressway, it served as one of the eastbound destinations for exit 62\\\\. On the northeast corner of the westbound service road is the Waverly Avenue Elementary School. The remainder of CR 61 is residential and wooded. Due to the lack of county route shields, CR 61 ends unceremoniously at CR 16 (Horseblock Road), east of where CR 16 moves from the eastern terminus of Portion Road onto Horseblock Road. North of Horseblock Road, a town maintained extension of Waverly Avenue curves through the hills of a housing development towards College Road, at the former intersection with Highview Drive, a partial dirt road that had street name signs years after being closed off. ;Major intersections County Route 62 County Route 62 can be found on the west side of the Shinnecock Canal along Newtown Road north of Montauk Highway and partially into Sunset Avenue at the Shinnecock County Marina. The entire route is in the hamlet of Hampton Bays. ;Route description CR 62 begins as Newtown Road at a divided section of Montauk Highway (CR 80) and is the last intersection on the highway before it crosses the Shinnecock Canal. Access to CR 62 is available from both directions on Montauk Highway, but traffic entering it can only do so from a south to westbound ramp that may have been a former segment of Montauk Highway itself. A U-turn ramp exists for north to westbound traffic. The road then passes by some town of Southampton parkland, and then an bridge beneath the Montauk Branch of the Long Island Rail Road. Further north, a local street named Gate Street leads to the only street that runs closer to the canal than Newtown Road does. Like CR 39B on the east side of the canal, CR 62 runs beneath the Sunrise Highway Bridge over the canal, but has no access to that road. After passing by some marinas and shore front homes, CR 62 seems to terminate at a T-intersection, but in reality makes a right turn at that intersection onto Sunset Avenue. Newtown Road, on the other hand, continues northwest through part of the Shinnecock Indian Reservation along the coast of the Great Peconic Bay and then west along the south end of Squire Pond before the intersection of Squiretown Road which leads to CR 32 and the Ponquogue Bridge, and Red Creek Road, which runs along the bay again towards NY 24\\\\. ;Major intersections The entire route is in Hampton Bays. County Route 63 County Route 63 is a two-lane north–south highway that connects Riverside and NY 24 with Riverhead and NY 25. It is named Lake Avenue (formerly Old East Moriches–Riverhead Road) south of a traffic circle with NY 24 and Peconic Avenue north of it. It has a posted speed limit for a majority of its length. The road begins at an intersection with CR 51 and heads northeast, roughly continuing the track of CR 51 while that road curves north onto Center Drive South. It passes the shores of Wildwood Lake and provides access to streets leading to homes along the north and east side of the lake. The road then intersects a traffic circle, which forms the gateway into downtown Riverhead. Here, it links with CR 104, CR 94, and NY 24\\\\. The road then continues a short ways north via Peconic Avenue to terminate at an intersection with NY 25\\\\. The road is a former portion of CR 51, and the CR 63 designation was given to this section when CR 51 was shifted to the newly built Center Drive South. ;Major intersections County Route 64 County Route 64 is the unsigned designation for Bellport Avenue, and Station Road from the village of Bellport to Coram–Yaphank (Mill) Road and for Coram–Yaphank Road from Bellport Avenue to NY 112 since 1998. In the 1960s it was applied to Dunes Road–not to be confused with CR 89 in Westhampton Beach–near Meschutt Park at the Shinnecock Canal. On October 30, 1975 it was applied to Long Island Avenue (also known as Patchogue Road) between CR 101 and CR 21 on the north side of the Long Island Expressway in Yaphank. ;Major intersections County Route 65 County Route 65 is primarily Middle Road from Sayville to Patchogue, where it includes Atlantic Avenue, Weeks Street, River Avenue, and Division Street. In the late 1990s, Middle Road was converted into a one-way street between Main Street and Foster Avenue, forcing Foster Avenue to become part of CR 65\\\\. ;Route description CR 65 begins as Middle Road at CR 85 (Main Street), although this section is only a one-way street until it reaches the first intersection at Collins Avenue, which is across the street from the NRHP-listed Sayville Congregational Church. The next intersection is Foster Avenue, which is the only two-way access to Montauk Highway. From here Middle Road passes by St. Anne's Episcopal Church, which was recently added to the National Register of Historic Places, and contains the St. Anne's Cemetery in the back. The road then runs through the Sans Soucci Lakes County Park, with a driveway to the NRHP-listed John Ellis Roosevelt Estate on the north side. East of the parkland, the road officially enters the hamlet of Bayport. The first intersection to pass for a major intersection within Bayport is McConnell Avenue. At the intersection with the two-lane divided Edgewater Avenue, CR 65 takes a northeasterly turn and serves as the southern border of Bayport Commons Park. Bayview Avenue is also across from this park, which ends just west of the intersection of Conetquot Road. Snedecore Avenue intersects Middle Road and is one of the few streets along the road to span from Montauk Highway to the Great South Bay, thus making it an important street by local standards. One of the few areas of commercial zoning along the road is at the blinker-light intersection of Bayport Avenue, where Middle Road moves slightly to the southeast, only to return to the northeast before reaching Gillette Avenue. Shortly after this, CR 65 crosses the Islip–Brookhaven town line, where it enters the hamlet of Blue Point. In what will be a common pattern in the town of Brookhaven, Middle Road makes a sharp left turn to the north, then a right turn at the intersections of Humphrey Road (to the west) and Avery Lane (to the north). CR 65 then crosses a creek that's within a New York State Department of Environmental Conservation preserve area. Once the road exits this preserve, it intersects Lane's End and Nelson Avenue, where it runs between two mansions, one of which is the St. Ursula Retreat Center on the southwest corner of the intersection with Blue Point Avenue. Blue Point Avenue and Middle Road has another set of blinker-lights, partially because it is a four-way stop intersection and partially because it is actually a pair of T-intersections set close to one another that requires a slight shift to the right for all traffic on Middle Road. After this fiasco, the road passes Bergen Avenue and makes a slight curve to the northeast, only to curve east again and cross the Corey's Creek Bridge, where one can find sites such as the Blue Point Marina, Corey's Creek Park, and a local roadside luncheonette. Middle Road ends at Atlantic Avenue and CR 65 turns north onto Atlantic Avenue, until it reaches the intersection of Weeks Street, and turns back east again. From there, it crosses Tuthills Creek and enters the village of Patchogue, where it ends at River Avenue, and as Middle Road did with Atlantic Avenue, CR 65 turns north onto River Avenue. Just before River Avenue reaches the at-grade crossing with the Montauk Branch of the Long Island Rail Road, CR 65 turns east one last time at the intersection of Division Avenue, which runs directly along the south side of the tracks. Before crossing the Patchogue River, CR 65 move slightly away from the edge of the tracks, but not far enough away to be out of sight from the tracks. CR 65 ends at CR 19 (West Avenue). Consequently, CR 19's southern terminus is also at this intersection, but West Avenue continues south as a Patchogue Village street to Patchogue Bay. Likewise, Division Street east of CR 65 is also a village maintained street that continues eastward in front of Patchogue Railroad Station which spans the north side of Division Street between West Avenue and South Ocean Avenue. The road then become Baker Street at Patchogue Village Hall and finally terminates at Rider Avenue. ;Major intersections County Route 66 County Route 66 is Deer Park Road East in Dix Hills, serving as a connecting spur between NY 231 (via CR 35) and NY 25\\\\. Until 1972, it was designated CR 35B. ;Route description CR 66 begins at a wye intersection with CR 35, which at one time was also intended to include a North Deer Park Avenue Spur connecting to the Babylon–Northport Expressway. The only other major intersection between the two termini of CR 66 is a segment of DeForest Road which begins as the off-ramp of exit 42N of the Northern State Parkway. All other intersections at this point are residential streets. CR 66 ends at NY 25 in Elwood, just west of Elwood Road, where the interchange for the former Babylon–Northport Expressway was supposed to exist. ;Major intersections County Route 67 County Route 67 consists of part of Half Hollow Hills Road and all of the remaining segment of Long Island Motor Parkway that is still suitable for motor vehicles. ;Major intersections County Route 67A County Route 67A was originally Half Hollow Hills Road from Pinelawn Road to Motor Parkway, that served as an extension of CR 67\\\\. It was eventually decommissioned and merged into CR 67\\\\. County Route 68 County Route 68 is an unsigned two-lane road that runs through historic Stony Brook along Main Street, Christian Avenue, and eventually into Setauket along Ridgeway Avenue, part of which was at one time part of NY 25A.Hagstroms Western Suffolk County Road Atlas (1941) The entire route is also shared with New York State Bicycle Route 25.State Bike Route 25 (Bicycling in New York; NYSDOT) ;Route description CR 68 begins as Main Street at NY 25A near the Stony Brook Museum and Carriage House, as a north-south road. It begins at a segment of NY 25A that briefly runs north and south within Stony Brook before making a sharp right turn towards Setauket, Port Jefferson and points east. A west-to-northbound ramp exists on the northeast corner of the intersection, When CR 68 runs through the Stony Brook village center, it turns into an east- west road. At a fork in the road with Hollow Road which heads southeast, CR 68 moves onto Christian Avenue and heads northeast. The rest of CR 68 is surrounded by historic houses, although it also includes the North Shore Montessori School and a local Methodist Church and Cemetery. From there it intersects the appropriately named Blinker Light Road and Cedar Street, which are less than five feet away from each other. Cedar Street heads toward The Stony Brook School and Stony Brook's train station, while CR 68 continues northeast into what is commonly referred to by mapmakers as \\"Old Stony Brook.\\" Christian Avenue continues northeast but CR 68 moves southeast onto Bailey Hollow Road, which ends at the intersection of Quaker Path Road, and becomes Ridgeway Avenue.

The National Gallery, London Portrait of a Lady in Yellow was painted by the Florentine artist Alesso Baldovinetti sometime in the second half of the 15th century, most likely c. 1465.Based on its stylistic resemblance to other works For centuries the work was mis-attributed; it was purchased by the National Gallery London in 1866 as a portrait of Countess Palma of Urbino, attributed to Piero della Francesca. In 1911 art historian Roger Fry established that it was by Baldovinetti. However, there is no evidence of the source of the commission, and doubt remains as to the identity of the sitter; the most plausible theory is that she is Francesca degli Stati of Urbino. The sitter is shown in profile, reflecting the early Renaissance interest in the Antique, and lending the work an almost sculpted feel. She is set against a uniform blue background, in a canvas that is largely flat and lacking in either perspective or depth. Instead the focus of the work centers on the fineries of both her headdress and adorned sleeve. Attribution Until 1911 the painting was attributed to Piero della Francesca;Rowlands, Eliot W. \\"Baldovinetti's 'Portrait of a Lady in Yellow'\\". The Burlington Magazine, Volume 122, No. 930, September 1980. 624–625, 627 largely due to its similarity to his portrait of the Dutchess of Urbino. In 1911 Roger Fry established that the work was by Baldovinetti. Fry based his claim on several grounds, including technique, colour scheme and the form of the woman's face and drapery, all of which he believed could only be credited to Baldovinetti. Drawing from his own observations and details from Giorgio Vasari's The Lives of the Artists he noted elements of Baldovinetti's style not common among contemporary Italian painters, including the manner in which he used tempera rather than hatching to fuse colour. He further notes the use of dry colouration and straw yellow present in the work and typical of Baldovinetti, while Francesca tended towards more earthy skin tones with a bright luminous finish.Fry, Roger. \\"On a Profile Portrait by Baldovinetti\\". The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs, volume 18, no. 96, March 1911. 308–313 Today Fry's attribution to Baldovinetti is accepted without real doubt. Description Alesso Baldovinetti, Madonna and Child, c. 1460–1465, Louvre, Paris. Roger Fry noted the closeness in proportion and the similarity in form of the women's facial features when he claimed Baldovinetti as the artist behind Portrait of a Lady in Yellow. The woman is shown in profile, reflecting the contemporary interest in classical art. The similarity is closely aligned with antique gems and coins, and the contemporary medals that imitated them.Langmuir, 21–22 The profile view allowed an easy way to render the particulars of a face, although it often highlighted unflattering features; in this case her receding chins and brows, and the uneven line of her nose. However it did allow Baldovinetti to flatter the cut of her dress, the line of her hair and highlight the (probably imagined) length of her neck.\\"What Fabulous Faces!\\". Evening Standard. October 17, 2008 A thin white line runs around the edge of the profile to accentuate it.Langmuir, 21 Her adorned sleeve attracts the viewer's attention and contains the most intricate levels of detail. These were the height of fashion at the time, often detachable from the gown (camora), and of a higher value, often by multiples than the main costume. She wears a thin black lenza on her forehead which seems to be made from fine black silk, while her frenello headdress is almost as fine, and given as much detail, as her sleeve. The picture is still in its original frame.Langmuir, 22 The sitter has elegance and some delicate, fine, facial features-notable her shaven or plucked eyebrow and cheekbones, but she is not beautiful. Writer Jill Condra described her as \\"harsh\\" looking with a \\"serious\\" forehead.Condra, 16 The woman has a distinctive nose, and seems to be flat chested, while her lower lip protrudes over the upper. However, she has an elongated, dignified neck, and attractive orange hair which lively spills to her shoulders, though the hair falling on her back may be false, a fashionable adornment.Broude & Garrard, 46 She wears pearls on her head and around her neck which represents her wealth, while her hair is plucked back as was the fashion of the dayhttps://www.laetitiana.co.uk/single-post/2017/08/10/15th-Century- Florentine-Portraits. In common with other Italian female portraits of the time, the work is largely flat, and rendered with little indication of volume. It is typical for the era in being more concerned with outline than volume, and in common with many other mid-15th century female portraits, sets a pale but rose lipped female against a flat blue background.A similar device was to set the portrait against a large blue sky devoid of cloud or landscape The colourisation is opaque; she has excessively pale skin. which apart from blush found on her cheekbone, is lighter, but similar in hue to both her dress and hair. In addition, the image is largely static; the woman is fixed against a rigid and uniform blue background, the only indication of movement is her falling locks of hair.Tinagli, 53 Her expression is enigmatic and inscrutable, the portrait is an idealisation, showing the sitter as chaste and incorruptible. Art historian Dennis Geronimus described the immobility of this work and similar portraits as depictions of \\"pale bright-lipped...pinned butterflies.\\"Geronimus, 36 In 2008 the Evening Standard, described the portrait as \\"so clear and sharp that she is as unreal as she is real...[a] painted ideal of fashionable blonde hair, pale skin, and unnaturally lofty brow. Identity of the sitter Portrait Federico da Montefeltro, Piero della Francesca, c. 1465–1470. In this portrait, the Duke is shown in profile not because of the influence of classical art, but because his right eye had been injured in battle. The identity of the sitter remains uncertain and art historians have looked for clues in the pattern in her sleeve. Undoubtedly a heraldic design, its three palm leaves, with two dark feathers bound by ribbon, would have represented the coat of arms of her family or her suitor's.\\"Portrait of a Lady\\". National Gallery. Retrieved December 17, 2010. Given the finery of her costume and jewels, she was almost certainly a noblewoman.Potterton, 36–37 Dutchess of Urbino, Piero della Francesca, c. 1465–1470. Note the resemblance of her nose to that of the sitter's in Baldovinetti's portrait. It was first suggested in 1924, largely based on the coat of arms, that she may be Francesca degli Stati, wife of Angelo Galli (d. 1459) a minor poet and diplomat from Urbino. Francesca was celebrated in 1445 for uncovering a plot against Federico da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino, whose wife is portrayed in the Piero della Francesca that lead to the mis- attribution. The emblem of the Galli family is identified in a June 1443 letter as consisting of tre penne (three pens), which may be reference to the feathers as writing instruments, though Baldovinetti's portrait shows two, not three. There is a further link in the palm leaves, which were a decorative motif for the homes of members of the family, and their main palazzo in the Borgo di Valbona, Urbino was often known as the palazzo della palme. In 1599, the family changed their name to Palma.  References  Sources * Broude, Norma; Garrard, Mary D. (eds.). The Expanding Discourse: Feminism and Art History.

It was opened by Russian art collector Alexander Ivanov on . Description The museum's collection contains over 1,500 items made by Fabergé. Items in the collection include a rare silver decanter in the form of a rabbit and the last Imperial Easter Egg, the Karelian Birch egg, made of Karelian birch with gold and diamonds for Easter 1917. However, Czar Nicholas II was deposed before he could give it to his mother. When Ivanov first bought the Karelian egg, some experts resisted because its existence wasn’t known previously. Ivanov now has documents found in the Russian state archives proving that the egg is genuine. The Fabergé company was founded in St Petersburg in 1842, and it was an official supplier to the Russian Imperial court from 1885 to 1917. It also supplied high-end luxury goods to the Russian and European aristocracy. Besides the czars, clients included the Queen of the United Kingdom and the royal family of Siam (now Thailand). Fabergé was closed after the Bolsheviks seized power in 1917. The company’s artworks became popular again in the 1960s with Western collectors, led by Malcolm Forbes. Prices reached records in the early part of the 21st century, thanks to Russians such as Ivanov who took a fancy to fine artworks of the country’s heritage. Ivanov said his museum building cost about 17 million euros to buy and renovate, including a 1 million euro security system. He chose Baden-Baden, near Germany’s western border, because it is “quiet and nice, middle in Europe, close to France and Switzerland, a resort for the rich, and historically it has always been the most popular resort for Russians.” Ivanov said that one reason that he opened the museum in Germany was due to safety concerns. He told Britain's Independent newspaper: \\"It's very difficult [in Russia] because of all the administrative barriers [...] You have to be indebted to someone, and you can never feel that your collection is safe – not from the state, not from bandits, not from anyone. In Germany we spend serious money on security of course, but at least you know that the state itself won't do anything.\\"Russian billionaire feathers his Fabergé nest egg, Independent The museum's first year was marked by a bitter court conflict. In April 2009, just a month before the official opening, a company calling itself Faberge Ltd. that is registered in the Cayman Islands and owned by the Gilbertson family of South Africa filed a lawsuit over rights to the Fabergé trademark. This made the Fabergé museum’s first year a difficult one. While the case was pending, the museum couldn’t use the Fabergé name, which meant no advertising or even a sign on the door. In January 2010, a German court ruled in favor of the Fabergé Museum, and it immediately began to resume functioning with full right to use the Fabergé name.Ivanov Vies Faberge, Boosts $2 Billion Museum Collection, Bloomberg In May 2012, the Fabergé Museum opened a new permanent exhibition titled Gold of the World. It consists of just over 100 gold items from various civilizations and continents that date from the 6th century B.C. up until the mid 20th century. Among the items are an ancient Iranian chalice, ancient Greek jewelry, Fabergé cigarette cases, Aztec and Inca gold jewelry, and a very rare 18th century British gold trophy.\\"Fabergé Museum opens a new permanent exhibition dedicated to gold jewelry over the past 2,500 years\\", Art Daily Rothschild Fabergé egg The most significant item in the museum's collection was the Rothschild Fabergé egg, which was made as an engagement gift from Béatrice Ephrussi de Rothschild to her brother's fiancée. Ivanov bought it at Christie's auction house in London on 28 November 2007, for £9 million, because he thinks that it is the “finest ever” made by Fabergé. However, in December 2014, Russia's President Vladimir Putin gifted the Rothschild Fabergé egg to the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Days before this gift was made, British and German customs officers raided the Fabergé Museum looking for the egg. The museum said that the officers' actions were politically motivated, coming amid tensions between the West and Russia, and hoping to ruin the gift ceremony and embarrass Russia's head of state.

He was born at Kenmore in 1788, and educated partly by his father, and afterwards at Edinburgh and at St. Andrews University, here he graduated. Coming to London from St. Andrews with high commendations for his Greek and Latin acquirements, he engaged in tuition, and kept several high- class schools in succession in different parts of the metropolis. He devoted his leisure to the cultivation of literature and science. Of his humorous articles \\"The Three Florists,\\" in Eraser for January 1838, and \\"The Dream of Tom Finiarty, the Cab-driver,\\" in the Athenæum, are notable examples. His scientific papers appeared chiefly in the Arcana of Science and Art (1837 et seq.), and relate to meteorological matters. But his great work was A Gaelic Dictionary, in two parts — I.

This work, running to nearly 1100 pages, was the first Gaelic dictionary to attempt to provide etymological information. It also improved on previous works by incorporating a grammar of Gaelic and by indicating the word-class of entries. In the Dictionary of National Biography published 1885, Thompson Cooper calls it \\"a most meritorious work,\\" writing \\"the affinities of the Celtic words being traced in most of the languages of ancient and modern times. To it is prefixed a Gaelic grammar, and there is a short historical appendix of ancient names, deduced from the authority of Ossian and other poets.\\" However, in the modern edition of the Dictionary of National Biography published in 2004, W. Steven Dodd writes \\"Armstrong can be seen in hindsight as overcredulous in accepting the authenticity of ‘Ossian’—devoting an appendix to characters from his poems—and overenthusiastic in offering not just (frequently accurate) Indo- European cognates for the words whose etymologies he provides, but also parallels from other language families which later developments in linguistic sciences have discredited. He makes it plain in his preface that he believes all languages have a single origin, which is highly debatable, and that Scottish Gaelic is the ancestor of Irish, Manx, and even Welsh, which is definitely wrong.\\" Armstrong's dictionary was partially eclipsed, three years after its appearance, by the publication of the still more comprehensive Dictionarium Scoto-Celticum, compiled under the direction of the Highland Society of Scotland (2 vols. 4to, 1828). Armstrong sank his small fortune in the publication of his three-guinea quarto, and in a pecuniary sense he was a considerable loser by its publication. For about twenty-two years he maintained his family by establishing the South Lambeth Grammar School, and on his retirement from the head-mastership to Richmond in 1852 a representation of his necessitous condition was sent to Lord Palmerston, who obtained for him a civil list pension of £60. This opportune assistance and a grant from the Royal Literary Fund enabled him to recommence his scholastic business, which, though now of small proportions on account of his great age, he continued till he was struck down by paralysis about a week before he died. In 1826 he had been appointed Gaelic lexicographer in ordinary to the king, but the appointment was honorary and no salary was attached to it. He died in Choumert Road, Peckham Rye, Surrey, 25 May 1867. Lord Derby advised her majesty to cheer the last days of the veteran scholar by a grant of £100 from the Royal Bounty Fund; and in 1869 Queen Victoria, on the recommendation of Prime Minister Gladstone, granted an annual pension of £50 to his widow. Dr. Armstrong married, in 1842, Emma, daughter of Stephen Dungate, by whom he left three daughters.

Ayreminne was a younger brother of William de Ayreminne, bishop of Norwich. He was probably in early life a clerk of the exchequer. On 26 May 1324 he was made keeper of the rolls in the place of his brother William. Between 16 November and 12 December of the same year he kept the great seal during the absence of the chancellor, Robert de Baldock, in Scotland. On 4 July 1325 Henry Cliff was substituted for Richard de Ayreminne in the keepership of the rolls, probably in consequence of the quarrel of his brother William with Edward II as to his right to the see of Norwich. In September 1325 Richard was appointed rector of Elveley (Alveley, co. Salop), and made by his brother chancellor of his diocese of Norwich. But shortly afterwards he, with another brother, Adam, left for France to join his brother William. In 1326 Edward II issued a writ complaining of the refusal of the brothers to appear before him, and directing the Archbishop of York to secure their attendance. After Edward III's accession in 1327 Richard was made clerk of the privy seal, and subsequently guardian of the Jewish converts for life. On 7 June 1339 he resigned this post. He was appointed chancellor of the diocese of Salisbury 16 July 1339; and since a successor to him was nominated in 1340, that year has been assumed to be the date of his death.

Career A Licentiate in law from the University of Lisbon and a lawyer, he became president of the Junta de Crédito Pública and Procurator General of the Republic. He became an associate of Sporting CP in December 1934 and was part of the social bodies of the club in many mandates, fulfilling many duties for twelve consecutive years, having participated nine time in the club's direction before becoming its president, two as a vogal and seven consecutive as vice president, between 19 January 1946 and 30 January 1952. He was part of the counsel general, organ he presided between 1963 and 1965, and of which he was considered a member for life. He was also created an associate of merit. Under his leadership José Travassos, one of the Five Violins (Cinco Violinos), who also played in his time and included António Jesus Correia, Fernando Peyroteo, Albano and Manuel Vasques, in 1955, was the first Portuguese soccer player to become a player for the Selection of Europe against Great Britain and Northern Ireland, in Belfast, gaining his nickname \\"Zé da Europa\\". Sporting had to compete in lent pitches until finally Estádio José Alvalade was built and inaugurated by him on 10 June 1956 at Campo Grande, in Lisbon. This event also coincided with the Golden anniversary of the club, celebrated with a vast ensemble of activities and in a manner never seen before in the country. For the occasion was also published the book \\"50 Anos ao Serviço do Desporto e da Pátria\\" (\\"Fifty Years at the Service of Sport and Motherland\\"), which constitutes a unique document about the history of the first half a century of Sporting CP. The club's motto \\"Esforço, Dedicação, Devoção e Glória: Eis o Sporting\\" (\\"Effort, Dedication, Devotion and Glory: Here Is Sporting\\") was also adopted during his tenure, one that gave a special attention to Sportig's Filiations and Delegations both in the continent, the islands and the overseas. The club has won the Portuguese Football Championship and the Cup of Portugal in 1952/1953, the Portuguese Football Championship again in 1953/1954, with which he finished a sequence of four consecutive winnings, and the Championship of Reserves in 1954/1955. He has also sent two Embassies of the club to Brazil, receiving the Knighthood of the Order of the Southern Cross for one of those occasions. He was once the protagonist of an event in 1953 involving goalkeeper Carlos António Gomes, later soccer player at Futebol Clube Barreirense, mentioned in his memory book O Jogo da Vida. His income was 5,000$00 escudos or five contos a month and, finding it a low wage, he asked in an audience with the President for a raise to 20,000$00 escudos or 20 contos, which he denied. Góis Mota said \\"You want more money? Well put inside your head, if you have it, that as long as I am President it's five contos or nothing. What do you want more money for? For putas and automobiles?\\"Queres mais dinheiro? Pois mete na tua cabeça, se é que a tens, que enquanto for presidente são cinco contos ou nada. Para que queres tu mais dinheiro? Para putas e automóveis?\\" The goalkeeper responded that it was none of his business, and that he did not accept that he was paid \\"five miserable contos\\"\\"cinco miseráveis contos\\". when some of the players were receiving 20 or more. This confrontation later had negative results on his career.http://www.fcbarreirense.com/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=831&Itemid;=36 Góis Mota was also famed for once entering into the referee's cabin, at midtime, reportedly with a pistol in his hand, on 11 November 1956, at the Estádio da Tapadinha, during a game Atlético CP – Sporting. The game was tied 1-1 and apparently he was not enjoying the arbitration of Braga Barros, referee from Leiria, and he \\"advised him to take a better care in the 2nd part because he could get wronged.,\\"aconselhou-o a tomar mais atenção na 2ª parte pois poderia prejudicar-se.\\" Contrary to the popular belief he was not a PIDE Agent. He was actually Member, Commander and Secretary General of the Portuguese Legion. In this position in 1961, at the outbreak of the Portuguese Colonial War, he recruited a company (called terço in the Portuguese Legion) of volunteers in order to protect the facilities of the Companhia Angolana de Agricultura, owned by the Espírito Santo Silva banking family in Cuanza Sul Province. It was also by his initiative that he and the Services of Information of the Portuguese Legion then headed by retired Education Inspector Parente de Figueiredo and which included also journalist Luís Lupi, hired, in order to become a special agent in Angola Fernando da Conceição Araújo, a former merchant and colonist at New Lisbon who had bankrupt, remaining his supervisor. He is the grandfather of António Mota de Sousa Horta Osório.

In 1911, Hai Chi visited the United Kingdom to participate in the fleet review held to mark George V's coronation. It also visited Newcastle for an electrical refitting at Armstrong Whitworth. Due to the occurrence of the Torreón massacre in Mexico, its mission was extended to include a visit to the United States, Cuba and Mexico. On 11 September 1911, she was the first Imperial Chinese Navy vessel in American waters.New York Tribune September 12,1911 While the ship was in Cuba, Mexico agreed to Chinese demands for reparations and action against the rebels, and the last leg of the ship's mission was cancelled.

In 1917 it was part of the fleet which joined Sun Yat-sen's Constitutional Protection Movement against the Beijing government.

In 1933, due to a dispute with the fleet commander over pay and expenses, Hai Chi along with two ships travelled south and joined the Guangdong navy. In 1935, due to a dispute with the governor of Guangdong province, Hai Chi together with another ship fought its way past a blockade to reach Hong Kong, and eventually to the capital Nanjing, where (as a compromise) they were nominally returned to the Third Fleet, but in reality came under the direct command of the ministry of defence.

Ehremar was a priest from Thérouanne in France who in old age went east with the First Crusade. In 1102 Dagobert of Pisa was deposed as Patriarch by the papal legate, Cardinal Robert of Paris, on charges of misconduct brought by the King of Jerusalem, Baldwin I. When the legate asked for a candidate to be the new patriarch, the Palestinian bishops suggested Ehremar, who was known for his piety and charity. Baldwin was happy to accept the appointment as he knew that Ehremar, unlike Dagobert, would not set the claims of the church against his power as king.Steven Runciman, A History of the Crusades, Volume II, The Kingdom of Jerusalem, Cambridge University Press, 1952, pp. 83-84 In 1104, Baldwin accepted the surrender of Acre on a promise that the Moslem residents would be allowed to leave safely with their property, but Genoese sailors ignored the promise and murdered and robbed them. Baldwin was furious and would have attacked the Genoese but Ehremar patched up a reconciliation. Shortly afterwards, he came to assist with the conquest of Jaffa at Baldwin's request with the True Cross to encourage the troops, and one hundred and fifty men he had recruited.Runciman, op. cit., pp. 88-89 In the same year Dagobert went to Rome to appeal against his deposition, and Pope Paschal II reinstated him. When Ehremar heard about this, he went to Rome, but he arrived to find his rival had died. Paschal was then inclined to re-appoint Ehremar, but king Baldwin had become dissatisfied with him, considering him inefficient. Baldwin sent Arnulf of Chocques, who had himself been displaced as patriarch in favour of Dagobert in 1099, to oppose Ehremar. Paschal sent Ghibbelin of Arles, Archbishop of Arles, to Jerusalem as legate to decide the matter. Ghibbelin found that Ehremar was unfitted for the position and declared it vacant, and Baldwin then proposed Ghibbelin himself as patriarch. He accepted and Ehremar was compensated with the Archbishopric of Caesarea.Runciman, op. cit., pp. 84-85. The date of these events is unclear. According to Runciman, Dagobert went to Rome in 1105, but did not die until 1107 and Ehremar's replacement by Ghibbelin took place in spring 1108, but Patricia Skinner corrected the date of Dagobert's death to 1105.

Humphreys, 'Brooke, Lady Elizabeth (1601-1683), Dictionary of National Biography (1885-1900), Vol. 6. and was matriarch of a landed manorial family in East Suffolk, East Anglia, during the English Civil War and Restoration periods. An extended account of her religious thought and practice, written by her minister at Yoxford, Suffolk at the time of her funeral, was printed together with some of her own precepts. Her stance and practice was, like that of her brother Lord Colepeper, politically loyal to the Crown, and her allegiance was therefore to the established Church, but she and her husband, Sir Robert Brooke, lived and worked in close connection with the more Puritan or Presbyterian spirit among the gentry and magistracy of the neighbourhood, and supported a moderate and inclusive policy towards ministers inclined to Nonconformism within the church at large. Origins Elizabeth Brooke was born Elizabeth Colepeper in 1601 at Great Wigsell in the parish of Salehurst in East Sussex, Subscription or UK public library membership required the only daughter of Thomas Colepeper (MP for Winchelsea in 1597 and for Rye in 1601) by his first wife Anne Slaney (died 1602). Anne was daughter of Sir Stephen Slaney, citizen and Skinner, Alderman of London 1584-1608 and Lord Mayor of London 1595-96, who died in 1608,A.B. Beavan, The Aldermen of the City London, temp.

Following Anne Colepeper's death in 1602 Thomas remarried to Mary, daughter of Roger Beeston, Merchant Taylor of London (died 1600) and widow of Francis Gibbon of Benenden, Kent, by whom he had a further son and three daughters.R.C.G., 'Colepeper, Thomas (c.1561-1613), of Wigsell, Suss.', in P.W. Hasler (ed.), The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1558-1603 (from Boydell and Brewer 1981), History of Parliament Online. Elizabeth's upbringing was entrusted to her maternal grandmother Dame Margaret Slaney, and Thomas Colepeper died in 1613 leaving provision for a dowry of £700 for her.Parkhurst, Faithful and Diligent Christian, 43.Will of Thomas Culpeper of Wigsell (P.C.C. 1613, Capell quire). Dame Margaret Slaney lived down to 1619 and, having made bequests of £1000 to each of the three children of her daughter Anne Colepeper, by her codicil made after the death of Thomas Colepeper (whom, she felt, had insufficiently advanced them) added a further £1000 for each of the sons and an additional £1500 for Elizabeth, to be paid to her on her marriage or at age 21. Dame Margaret further disposed that, if her granddaughters Elizabeth and Katherine should be unmarried at the time of her decease, then their upbringing and care should be in the hands of her daughter Dame Mary Weld.Will and Codicil of Dame Margaret Slanye (P.C.C. 1619).For Dame Mary Weld, see I.W. Archer, 'Weld [née Slaney], Mary, Lady Weld (bap. 1560?, d. 1623)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (2004). Marriage Cockfield Hall, Yoxford In 1620 Elizabeth married Sir Robert Brooke, son of a prominent London citizen and Grocer, Alderman (1590-1599) and Sheriff of London (1591-92).Beavan, Aldermen of London, II, p. 44 (Internet Archive).

Foster (ed.), The Register of Admissions to Gray's Inn, 1521-1889 (Hansard, London 1889), p. 82 (Hathi Trust). and was a notable patron of devout clergy. He had first been married, in October 1597, to Joan, a daughter of Sir Humphrey Weld, Sheriff of London in 1599-1600, also a leading City Grocer.Beavan, Aldermen of London, II, p. 46 (Internet Archive). At the time of Robert Brooke's first marriage, Brooke's father, who died in 1600,Will of Robert Brooke, Alderman of London (P.C.C. 1601, Woodhall quire). had purchased for him the manor and mansion of Cockfield Hall at Yoxford, Suffolk, from Sir Arthur Hopton, son of Sir Owen Hopton, Lieutenant of the Tower of London, whose country seat this had been. During his first marriage, which was childless, Brooke had completely rebuilt Cockfield Hall, and at her death aged 38 in 1618 Joan Brooke was buried in Yoxford church.Monumental Inscription, Yoxford Church, Suffolk: \\"Hic Iacet Sepulta Domina Iohanna Brooke Uxor Roberti Brooke Militis: Quae Fuit Primogenita Filiarum Humfridi Weld Militis. Vixit Annos Triginta Octo Et Obiit xxij Die Maij Ano Dni 1618\\". Joan was a daughter of Sir Humphrey Weld's first marriage, to Anne Wheler. After Dame Anne's death, Sir Humphrey had remarried to Mary Slaney, Elizabeth Colepeper's maternal aunt.Will of Stephen Slany, Alderman of Saint Swithin, City of London (P.C.C. 1609, Dorset quire). Alderman Sir Humphrey Weld died in 1610,Will of Sir Humphrey Weld, Alderman of the City of London (P.C.C. 1610, Wingfield quire). and Dame Mary, who had remained childless, became his wealthy and devout widow. After Elizabeth's marriage to Robert Brooke in 1620, for two years the pair lived in London as boarders with Dame Mary Weld.Parkhurst, Faithful and Diligent Christian, 45. Dame Mary died in 1622 or 1623, making generous further legacies to Elizabeth her niece, and mentioning Robert and Elizabeth's daughter Mary Brooke.Will of Dame Mary Weld, Widow of London (P.C.C. 1623, Swann quire). At about this time John Colepeper sold his family home of Wigsell to Cheney Colepeper, and it was afterwards demolished and rebuilt. Sir Robert, meanwhile, bought a residence at Abbots Langley in Hertfordshire, so that Dame Elizabeth could live within reach of her friends in London, before moving more permanently to Yoxford in Suffolk. During this time her house was frequented by the puritan Dr. Richard Sibbes (died 1635), Master of Katharine Hall, University of Cambridge, and Preacher to Grays Inn, who used to say that he went to other places mostly to satisfy others, but to the Brooke house to please himself. Among the manuscripts of her writings left at her death was included a quarto volume called a Body of Divinity, concerned with Christian Belief and Practice, dated A.D. 1631.'The Life and Death of the Lady Elizabeth Brooke', in N. Parkhurst, The Faithful and Diligent Christian Described and Identified (Samuel Sprint and John Harding, London 1684), pp. 41-81, at pp. 45-46 (eebo/tcp II). The Brookes at Yoxford John, Lord Colepeper, Dame Elizabeth Brooke's brother By the time the house at Abbots Langley was sold in July 1637,Suffolk Record Office, Ipswich: \\"Release by Sir Robert Brooke and Elizabeth, his wife, to John Heydon, Lincoln Inn, Esq., and Johan, his wife, of his messuage and property at Abbots Langley, Hertfordshire\\" (5 July 1637), ref. HA30/369/158 (Discovery Catalogue). the seven children of Sir Robert and Dame Elizabeth had been born, and the eldest, Mary, was 16 years old. They were, however, no strangers to Yoxford. Through the 1620s Sir Robert had represented Dunwich in parliament three times,J.P. Ferris, 'Brooke, Sir Robert (1573-1646), of Cockfield Hall, Yoxford, Suff. and Walbrook, London', in A. Thrush and J.P. Ferris, The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1604-1629 (from Cambridge University Press 2010), History of Parliament. and his controversies with the townsfolk of Walberswick (which lay within his manor of Westwood at BlythburghT. Gardner, An Historical Account of Dunwich, Antiently a City, Now a Borough (Author, London 1754), pp. 167-76 (Google)) had developed to a sustained level.P.M. Warner, Bloody Marsh: A Seventeenth-Century Village in Crisis (Windgather Press, 2000). The years leading up to and through the English Civil War were those in which Dame Elizabeth's brother John Colepeper emerged as a prominent figure in the Royalist party. Having been knighted for military service and for his usefulness as an advisor, he sat in Parliament for Rye in 1640 and was elected for Kent in the Long Parliament. He worked for the impeachment of Sir Robert Berkeley and voted for the attainder of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, and had a place on the committee of defence in 1641. However, John found himself in opposition to the proposed ecclesiastical reforms, more on account of their revolutionary than their religious tendency, and joined the Royalist party in January 1642.P.C. Yorke, 'Colepeper, John Colepeper, 1st Baron', in H. Chesney (ed.), Encyclopedia Britannica (1911), VI, pp. 675-76. He became Chancellor of the Exchequer from January 1642 to February 1643. He disapproved of the King's attempt to arrest John Pym and other members in that year, but, having presented the King's peace proposals to the Commons in August 1642, he took part in Prince Rupert's charge at Edgehill. He was appointed Master of the Rolls (for the king) in January 1643, a position which he retained in principle until his death, although displaced by the parliamentarian William Lenthall from November 1643 until May 1659. Colepeper thereafter emerged as a military adviser, who was disliked by Prince Rupert for his desire to seek peace by compromise, especially after he was raised to the peerage as Baron Colepeper of Thoresway in October 1644.P.C. Yorke, 'Colepeper, John Colepeper, 1st Baron', in H. Chesney (ed.), Encyclopedia Britannica (1911), VI, pp. 675-76. With the Royalist defeat in March 1646 Colepeper escaped to France where he joined Henrietta Maria and Lord Jermyn. He became a supporter of Prince Charles in exile.See O. Ogle, W.D. Macray and H.O.

Routledge and C. Firth (eds), IV: 1657-1660; V: 1660-1726, with index to vols IV and V (Internet Archive). Search term: Culpeper. Sir Robert Brooke had suffered a temporary setback in his quarrel with the commoners of Walberswick in 1642, who had brought a lawsuit against him, but had begun the work of reinforcing his own interests against them.T. Gardner, An Historical Account of Dunwich, Antiently a City, Now a Borough (Author, London 1754), p. 172 (Google). Together with other local gentry, he was created an Elder of the Halesworth Congregational classis in 1645.J. Browne, History of Congregationalism and Memorials of the Churches in Norfolk and Suffolk (Jarrold and Sons, London 1877), p. 609 (Google). On 10 July 1646 he died, aged 74, and was buried in Yoxford church. Widowhood in Yoxford ;Commonwealth and Restoration For two years after Sir Robert's death, Dame Elizabeth (aged 45 in 1646) was away from Suffolk. It was at about the time of the King's execution that she returned to Cockfield Hall and commenced her long last residence there, some 35 years in which as dowager she watched over her own family's misfortunes. The author of her eulogistic Life states that when the King was in his Enemies' hands, and they were planning to kill him, she became passionately concerned, and kept a private Fast in her closet hoping that the hand of Providence might avert that outcome. When she learned that God had permitted his death, as a judgement upon the Nation, she felt it with a mother's passions, saying that even the loss of one of her dearest children had not affected her so deeply.Parkhurst, 'Life and Death of Lady Elizabeth Brooke', p. 68. She referred probably to her daughter Elizabeth Bacon, who had died in the previous year aged about 25 leaving two infant children. She wrote to a friend, > \\"O that you were with us, though but for a few days, that we might bemoan > our selves together, and this miserable Nation; upon which God poureth out > so great Wrath, and yet such Spiritual Judgments are seized upon us! That > many of us who pretend the greatest Interest in Him, can see nothing but > Mercies and glorious Times: I find nothing so much moves me, as to hear Men, > whom I hope I may call pious, speak concerning the Times; my Patience is so > much put to it, as Rules of Wisdom and Policy can find no place with me. I > can truly say, I dissent from many, whom I would honour, and whose Judgments > I do in many things, prefer before my own, without any kind of Doubt, or > Reluctancy, admiring, and standing amazed at their Delusions. I am now > taught the great Danger of Evil Principles, strong Engagements, Spriritual > Pride, &c.;\\"Parkhurst, 'Life and Death of Lady Elizabeth Brooke', pp. 69-70. Her eulogist continues: \\"In reference to His present Majesty, her Loyalty proceeded by these steps: She was a true Mourner under his Sufferings, Exclusion, Exile, and the Disappointment of several Efforts that were made for his Restitution. And she so disgusted the then usurping Powers, that she would not joyn in the keeping of either the Fairing or Thanksgiving Days appointed by them in reference to their Designs, or Successes. She rejoyced in all his Deliverances and especially in his Miraculous and Happy Restauration. And I do verily believe there was no Person in the three Kingdoms, that better understood than she did the Dignity of the High Station, to which God restored Him, or that paid Him a greater Veneration, or prayed more heartily for Him, or was more sollicitous for His Safety, in His Person and Government.\\"Parkhurst, 'Life and Death of Lady Elizabeth Brooke', pp. 70-71. ;Household religion Lady Brooke was noted for her devotion to the Crown, to the Church of England, to learning and to personal piety. She was highly respected for her generosity of character and towards all claims upon her charity. Although always conforming to the established Church, and opposed to Separatism, she advocated moderation and comprehensive inclusion of nonconformist ministers, and personally supported individual ministers. She was a tireless reader of the scriptures, of biblical commentaries and of the ancient philosophers in English translations. Dr Reynolds, Bishop of Norwich 1661-1676, having been entertained at Cockfield Hall, found her conversation excellent.Parkhurst, 'Life and Death of Lady Elizabeth Brooke', p. 74. She took care to provide for her family \\"the daily help of Prayer Morning and Evening, with the reading of the Scriptures; and on the Lord's-day the Repetition of what was preached in the Publick Congregation. And for their further Benefit, she many Years together procured a Grave Divine to perform the Office of a Catechist in her House, who came constantly every Fortnight, and expounded methodically the Principles of Religion, and examined the Servants, which was formerly done by her Chaplains, till the Service of God in her Family, and the Care of the Parish were committed to the same Person.\\"Parkhurst, 'Life and Death of Lady Elizabeth Brooke', pp. 53-54. ;Family misfortunes Memorial inscription for John Brooke, 1652, with Brooke and Barnardiston arms The elder son John Brooke, who carried on his father's fight with the people of Walberswick and brought the matter to a height of trouble, died suddenly aged 25 in 1652 leaving a widow Jane (Barnardiston).T. Gardner, An Historical Account of Dunwich, Antiently a City, Now a Borough (Author, London 1754), p. 172-76 (Google), citing \\"Walberswick Accompt Book\\". The daughter Martha, who had married William Blois of Grundisburgh and had by him a son Charles, died in 1657, whereupon Jane married William Blois and became stepmother to the child.E. Farrer, 'The Blois MSS', Proceedings of the Suffolk Institute of Archaeology and Natural History XIV Part 2 (1911), pp. 147-226: at p. 150 (Society's pdf). There remained a younger son Robert Brooke, now heir presumptive, who married Anne Margarett Mildmay in 1659.Parkhurst, 'Life and Death of Lady Elizabeth Brooke', pp. 44-45. As the monarchy was restored, Dame Elizabeth's brother Lord Colepeper died in 1660. Young (Sir) Robert Brooke began a very promising parliamentary career, inherited his father's estates and established himself as landowner, magistrate, and militia officer and commissioner, but died unexpectedly in a bathing incident near Avignon in 1669. For Dame Elizabeth, \\"the sharpest of all her Trials was the untimely Death of her last Son, [which] invaded her like an Inundation of Waters, threatning all the Banks both of Reason and Grace: Her Friends feared she would not long survive it. But the Power and Presence of God supported her, and she not only lived many Years after it, but also recovered again in a great measure her former Chearfulness.\\"Parkhurst, 'Life and Death of Lady Elizabeth Brooke', pp. 44-45; 78-79. Through all this her unmarried daughter Mary remained with her, and young Charles Blois became the expected heir. Dame Elizabeth was harassed by lawsuits, though these were eventually decided in her favour. She became deaf in 1675, and after long illness died at Cockfield Hall on 22 July 1683, making provision for Mary to have lifetime custody of her estates and for their eventual descent to Elizabeth's grandson Charles Blois.Will of Dame Elizabeth Brooke, Widow of Cockfield Hall, Suffolk (P.C.C. 1684, Hare quire). Her chaplain Nathaniel Parkhurst, vicar of Yoxford where she was buried, preached her funeral sermon. In the following year he published it with a portrait, a Life and an appendix of her writings, dedicating the book to her daughter Mary. Mary arranged for the marble wall monument to be set up in the Cockfield Chapel at Yoxford church, which records the death of both her parents, but devotes most of its inscription to her mother's character and virtues. Writings The text supplied by Parkhurst, entitled Observations, Experiences, and Rules for Practice, consists of 63 printed pages (pp. 83-146) containing 61 Precepts with explanatory paragraphs. These evidently represent a transcript of one of Dame Elizabeth's manuscripts, \\"found written with her Ladiship's own Hand\\", which he says provides a most lively image of her mind, and hopes will be profitable for her readers.E. Brooke, ed. N. Parkhurst, 'Observations, Experiences, and Rules for Practice', in N. Parkhurst, Faithful and Diligent Christian (1684), pp. 83-146 (Umich/eebo). The following serves for an example: > \\"XLII. Faith is the Root of other Graces. Faith is the Principle of > Spiritual Life and Motion; every true good Work and Exercise of Grace take > their Rise and Vigor from Faith. A Christian prays, reads, and meditates, > hears, hopes, loves, is zealous for God, and doth good to others; Why? > because he believes.

The game was produced by Avalon Hill in 1993. Gameplay Kingmaker simulates Wars of the Roses. Kingmaker reproduces the look and play of the board game almost exactly, allowing the player to compete with up to five computer controlled factions. The major change from the board game is the addition of a battle interface where the player can control his or her army in combat, but it is very simplistic and the option to resolve battles by the original method remains. Reception In Computer Gaming World in July 1994, Terry Lee Coleman rated the computer version of Kingmaker 3.5 stars out of five. While criticizing the lack of multiplayer in an adaptation of \\"a classic multiplayer boardgame\\" the reviewer said that it was \\"strangely addictive, and a class act\\". Approving of the \\"clever and varied AI\\", Coleman wrote, \\"Challenging and fun, despite its lack of high-tech glitz or multiplayer options, Kingmaker establishes a fine beachhead for AH's return to the computer wargame market.\\" The editors of PC Gamer US nominated Kingmaker for their 1994 \\"Best Historical Simulation\\" award, although it lost to Lords of the Realm. By August 1996, Kingmaker had sold over 40,000 copies. In his Computer Gaming World column, Coleman summarized these figures as \\"decent for a computer wargame\\". However, he noted that it had outsold every Avalon Hill computer game released since, and that Avalon Hill's brand reboot on computers had not gone as hoped.

He wrote it in Leipzig for the New Year's Day and first performed it on 1 January 1724 as part of his first cantata cycle. He adapted it in 1730 to , for the celebration of the bicentennial of the Augsburg Confession.  History and words  Bach wrote the cantata in 1723, his first year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, for New Year's Day, which is also the Feast of the Circumcision of Christ. The prescribed readings for the feast day were from the Epistle to the Galatians, by faith we inherit (), and from the Gospel of Luke, the circumcision and naming of Jesus eight days after his birth (). The unknown poet, possibly Picander, refers only in a general way to the readings: he mentions the naming at the end of movement 4, \\"\\" (name of Jesus), and he starts every line in the following aria with \\"Jesus\\". Otherwise the text stresses praise and thanks for the gifts of the past and prayer for further blessings. The poet compiled for the opening chorus a verse from Psalm 149 (), three verses from Psalm 150 (), and in between the first two lines of Martin Luther's \\"\\" (German Te Deum) \\"\\" (Lord God, Thee we praise). The words from the \\"Te Deum\\" appear again in the second movement, interspersed by recitative. The closing chorale is the second stanza of Johannes Hermann's \\"\\" (1591). Bach first performed the cantata on 1 January 1724. He performed it again in the second half of the 1730s. Probably in Bach's revision process, parts of the original music got lost: for the first two movements only the vocal parts and the violin parts survived. Reconstruction of the missing parts was attempted by Bernhard Todt (1904), Walther Reinhart (1948), Olivier Alain (1971), Diethard Hellmann (1995), Ton Koopman and Levente Gyöngyösi. In his Christmas Oratorio of 1734, Bach dedicated the complete Part IV for New Year's Day to the naming of Jesus, told in the one verse from the Gospel of Luke, first performed on 1 January 1735.  Scoring and structure  Luca della Robbia: Cantoria, Psalm 150 The cantata in seven movements is festively scored for alto, tenor and bass soloists, a four-part choir, three trumpets, timpani, three oboes, oboe d'amore, two violins, viola, and basso continuo including bassoon. The instrumentation is known from the extant closing chorale, although most parts for the first movements are lost. # Chorus: # Chorale and recitative (alto, tenor, bass): # Aria (alto, strings): # Recitative (bass): # Aria (tenor, bass, oboe d'amore): # Recitative (tenor, strings): # Chorale:  Music  The opening chorus on three psalm verses and two lines from Luther's \\"Tedeum\\" is a complex architecture in three sections. A concerto is concluded by the liturgical melody of \\"\\" in unison, a choral fugue \\"\\" (Everything that has breath) is concluded by a similar \\"\\", the final section Halleluja is a shortened reprise of the first. In the second movement, the liturgical melody is set four-part and interrupted by recitatives. The following alto aria is dance-like and simple, the duet is accompanied by an obbligato instrument which may be oboe d'amore or violin. Gardiner tried both, but then chose a viola d'amore instead. Neither movement has a da capo. The strings intensify the prayer of the last recitative. The choir of trumpets marks the ending of every line in the closing chorale.  Recordings  * J. S.

Puntukas is a glacial erratic—it was brought by glaciers during the last glacial period (18th–12th millennium BC) probably from Finland. It measures in length, in width, and in depth (including underground). It weighs about 265 tons. It is made of Rapakivi granite. Its reddish mass includes large crystals of potassium feldspar surrounded by green rings of oligoclase. In 1943, sculptor Bronius Pundzius engraved portraits and quotes from last wills of Lithuanian pilots Steponas Darius and Stasys Girėnas for the 10th anniversary of their deaths during the transatlantic flight with Lituanica. A local legend has it that velnias (a devil in the Lithuanian mythology) carried the stone to destroy the Anykščiai Church, however a rooster crowed. The devil disappeared back into the underworld, leaving only Puntukas behind. The legend was featured in the famous poem Anykščių šilelis by Antanas Baranauskas. According to another story, a brave Lithuanian warrior Puntukas was killed and was burned (a usual pagan custom) on the stone; since then it is known as Puntukas stone.

Common names include the melaleuca leaf weevil and the melaleuca snout beetle. It feeds on the leaves and shoots of the broad-leaved paper bark tree, Melaleuca quinquenervia, which is endemic to Australia where it grows on seasonally inundated plains and swampland, and was introduced into Florida in order to help drain flooded portions of the Everglades.Ferriter, et al (2004) Life cycle Adult weevils are gray and six to nine millimetres long, the males being slightly smaller than the females. They are usually found on the leaves and twigs of saplings or the new growth of larger melaleuca trees but are inconspicuous and their presence is most noticeable from the holes they chew in the buds, leaves and stems.Featured Creatures After mating, the females lays eggs singly or in small groups on the tips of young leaves or sometimes on more mature leaves and new plant growth. The eggs are yellow and one millimetre long when laid but the female usually covers them in a protective secretion which dries to form a hard, dark coloured casing. Female weevils can live for up to ten months, during which time they may produce from 500 to 1000 eggs at the rate of up to nine eggs per day.Purcell MF, Balciunas JK. 1994. Life history and distribution of the Australian weevil, Oxyops vitiosa (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), a potential biological control agent for Melaleuca quinquenervia (Myrtaceae). Annals of the Entomological Society of America 87: 867-873. The eggs hatch in about a week and the larvae moult four times, eventually reaching about 1.4 millimetres long. They are yellow when newly hatched but later instars are gray and slug-like. As they develop they become covered with a translucent yellowish oily secretion which turns black as faecal material adheres to it. This coating may provide protection from fire ants and other predators.Antipredatory Activity of the Weevil Oxyops vitiosa: A Biological Control Agent of Melaleuca quinquenervia The larvae often trail a black faecal string behind them. When feeding, they eat through all the layers of the leaf except for the cuticle on the far side, leaving paper-thin trails across the leaf surface as wide as their bodies. They take about seven weeks to develop and migrate downwards as they mature. The fourth instar is the puparium. The larva ceases to feed and crawls or falls to the ground and finds a suitable underground site in which to pupate. It develops a capsule about ten millimetres in diameter which becomes coated with soil that adheres to the oily surface coating. This stage lasts from two to six weeks but usually about four weeks. Various soil types support pupation but success rates may be higher where soils are sandy and well drained. Sites with saturated soils or permanently flooded areas did not support colonisation when the species was introduced in Florida in 1997.Center TD. et al. 2000. Field colonization of the melaleuca snout beetle (Oxyops vitiosa) in south Florida. Biological Control 19: 112-123. Host range This weevil feeds on Melaleuca quinquenervia, a tree in the myrtle family native to Australia. Tests were conducted in Australia to see whether any other plants acted as hosts to the weevil. Fewer than seven individuals were found on non-host species compared with more than a thousand on melaleuca. In laboratory tests, melaleuca was the only plant on which it proved possible to raise adults.Cornell University Before it was introduced into Florida the weevil was tested in quarantine on over one hundred species of plant growing locally including all the members of the Myrtaceae native to Florida. It was found that adults might sporadically feed on other plants but that the weevil did not reproduce on any other of the species tested.Wineriter, Susan, and Buckingham, Gary. 1997. Love at first bite - Introducing the Australian melaleuca weevil. Aquatics 19:10-12. Use in biological control The melaleuca tree, Melaleuca quinquenervia, was introduced into Florida as an ornamental and began to naturalize in about 1906. It was later planted extensively in order to help drain flooded portions of the Everglades. Here it flourished and is now considered to be an invasive species and a serious threat to the ecosystem. In Florida it has no host- specific natural enemies and the introduction of certain insect species from Australia to help control it is being investigated.Ecology and management of Melaleuca quinquenervia, an invader of wetlands in Florida, U.S.A. USDA scientists imported four insect species into quarantine for evaluation. Of these, the melaleuca leaf weevil seems the most promising. Both adults and larvae were found to disrupt the plant's normal growth processes which may make the plants more susceptible to other control measures. At certain test sites where the weevil has been introduced experimentally, flowering of the melaleuca tree has been reduced by up to 90%.Melaleuca quinquenervia dominated forests in Florida: analyses of natural-enemy impacts on stand dynamics This scale of damage may help to minimise the numbers of seeds produced and thus the spread of this invasive tree.

Anna Margareta von Haugwitz was a poor orphan from the untitled lower German nobility when she, as a ward of the German Elisabet Juliana of Erbach, who married the Swedish commander Johan Banér in 1636, met Carl Gustaf Wrangel in the Swedish military camp. The couple fell in love and married for love in 1640, which was unusual and controversial and aroused attention – Wrangel was a member of the most powerful Swedish nobility and his family disproved because she was of the untitled nobility as well as poor. The relationship between the couple was described as happy. After the Thirty Years' War, she lived mainly at the estates of Wrangel in Swedish Pomerania. At her death, she provided a sum of money to her birth city of Calbe, to be handed out every year at the date of her birth.

A practical website correlation process may require combining two or more of these methods. Similar structure To save time and effort, website owners duplicate major portions of website code across many domains. Similarity of code structure can provide enough information for correlation. Organizations known to have a publicly search-able databases for this kind of correlation include: *http://www.delineal.com note: Websites can sometimes utilize the same structure but have no relationship to each other (as when websites coincidentally utilize the same content management system). Same server or subnet Also known as correlated Reverse DNS lookup. Websites may be served from the same server, on one or more ip address, on one or more subnet. Several organizations retain archives of ip address data and correlate the data. Examples include: * http://www.domaintools.com note: Correlation via this method may be misleading because websites frequently exist on the same server (aka shared hosting) but have no relationship to each other. Same owner Websites may be authored by the same person or organization. Website owners are required to provide contact information to a registrar to obtain a domain name. Domain ownership can be determined via the WHOIS protocol which provides no mechanism for searching or correlating ownership. Several organizations retain archives of WHOIS information and provide searching and correlation services. Examples include: *http://whoisology.com *http://www.domaintools.com note: Website ownership information can be falsified, outdated, or hidden from public view. Website Correlation via this method can be accurate, misleading, or impossible depending on the information contained in WHOIS records. Similar content Search engines provide search-able databases of indexed website content. Search engine results lists are correlated by content similarity. =Google= * on Google.com type 'related:website_name_here.com' to find websites related by name or phrases * find a unique-sounding phrase on the website then use search engine(s) to locate the phrase literally on other websites **In the search box, place quotes around the phrase to do a literal phrase search **instead of copyright 2010 xyzcompany use \\"copyright 2010 xyzcompany\\" note: This method of correlation is inherently slow because one must guess which phrases to search for. Also, related websites may not contain literally similar content (as when a site is translated into another language).

Saint Joseph's dreams are four dreams described in the Gospel of Matthew in the New Testament in which Joseph, the legal father of Jesus, is visited by an angel of the Lord and receives specific instructions and warnings of impending danger. All four dreams come from the period around the Nativity of Jesus and his early life, between the onset of Mary's pregnancy and the family's return from the Flight to Egypt. They are often distinguished by numbers as \\"Joseph's first dream\\" and so on. Especially in art history, the first may be referred to as the Annunciation to Joseph. Biblical accounts The four dreams are as follows:A Dictionary of Biblical Tradition in English literature by David L. Jeffrey 1993 pages 538-540 :* First dream: In , Joseph is told not be afraid to take Mary as his wife, because she has conceived by the Holy Spirit. (See also the Annunciation in , when an angel visits Mary and she agrees to conceive \\"through the power of the Most High\\".) :* Second dream: In , Joseph is warned to leave Bethlehem and flee to Egypt. :* Third dream: In , while in Egypt, Joseph is told that it is safe to go back to Israel. :* Fourth dream: In , because he had been warned in a dream, he departed for the region of Galilee instead of going to Judea. In art The dreams have sometimes been depicted in art, though they have never been among the most common subjects from the Life of Jesus in art or the Life of the Virgin. It is often unclear which dream is intended. The second dream is probably most often depicted, and if there is no other indication it can be assumed that is the subject. If the Virgin Mary is present (but no infant Jesus), especially if visibly pregnant or shown spinning, this suggests the first dream, which tends to be shown in an indoor setting. An outside setting may suggest the second dream, as does the angel pointing outside the picture space, urging Joseph to leave. The tools of his carpentry workshop are often shown around him, probably indicating the second dream, although logically there seems to be no reason why these should not be present for the first and third dreams as well. The presence of the ox or ass from the Nativity scene suggests the second dream. In the absence of a place in a sequence, inscribed text, a title, or decor showing a setting in Egypt, the third and fourth dreams can generally be ruled out where there is uncertainty.Schiller, 57, 117, 124 File:T'oros Roslin - Joseph's Dream - Walters W53917R - Detail A.jpgToros Roslin, 1262 File:Bregenz Martinskapelle Fresken 05.jpgThe first dream, as shown by the angel's banderole, fresco, 1360 File:Rembrandt van Rijn 195.jpgSecond dream, Rembrandt and workshop, 1645, with ox File:Cavallino Dream of Saint Joseph.jpgBernardo Cavallino, c. 1645.

Its original name was The Order of the Fifteen, but it was later changed to The Order of Christian Mystics. Their intent was to combine Theosophy with traditional Christian doctrine. Their teachings were transmitted through Harriette by the Founder of the Theosophical Society, Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, otherwise simply referred to as The Teacher of the Order. The teachings of the order were promulgated mainly through a system of correspondence, extensive publishing of books and delivering of lectures at many centres. Their pupils numbered many thousands in over 70 countries. Mainly their works were aimed at the American esoteric fraternity, for it was believed that America would remain the spiritually dominant nation regarding Western mysticism for many years to come. The spiritual philosophy as espoused by this Order was based on a system of personal regeneration, otherwise called spiritual alchemy, by transmuting the base creative energy, through Divine purity, prayer, devotion, study and meditation. This was put forth in the Western mystical tradition, a system of mysticism suitable for the Western culture and mindset, encompassing a new interpretation on all former teachings given under the names of Rosicrucianism, Gnosticism and the Western mystery school teachings. The published works of their Teacher, Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, was mainly aimed at making available to the Western world the ancient Teachings of the East. This new effort had as its aim the promulgation of Christian mysticism based on the life and teachings of the Master Jesus and a mystical interpretation of the Bible, especially the works of the New Testament. Together through Hierarchy, Teacher, Order and inner circle they published 27 bound volumes of mystical teachings running over many editions, answered thousands of letters, delivered thousands of lectures, demonstrations and services across the USA over a 40-year period. It has only been in recent years (2009) that the combined works of the Order have once more seen the light of day and have been made available to all in the public domain. Harriette Augusta Curtiss, co-founder of The Order of Christian Mystics and later the Universal Religious Foundation, was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1856. Encyclopedia of American Women and Religion, June Melby Benowitz, 1998, 1st Edition. Her parents were John Horace Brown, organizer of the Pennsylvania State Teachers' Association and Emma Brightly Brown. Curtiss received a cultured education and developed into a talented musician and actress. After starring in a number of amateur theatrical productions she had the opportunity to become a professional, but her mother dissuaded her from doing so. She therefore put her writing talents to use for many years, authoring a column for the Philadelphia Inquirer under the pen name \\"The Bachelor Girl.\\" As the years passed, Curtiss found herself to be a gifted clairvoyant, developing a direct contact with that ascended teacher known as Madame Blavatsky and eventually launched a career in the realm of mysticism. In 1907 she married Dr Frank Homer Curtiss, and together they began working as occult teachers and writers. In the year of their marriage they founded The Order of the 15, which in 1908 became known as The Order of Christian Mystics. Harriette, who became known within the order as Rahmea, assumed the role of teacher, and her husband took the position of secretary (and was known by his order name of Pyrahmos). They worked together to prepare material for publication, though Harriette was the primary author. Throughout the rest of her life, she issued monthly lessons for students. The Curtisses produced more than 27 books and publications. The first was compiled from Harriette's written responses to questions from students and was titled Letters from the Teacher (1909). Her early lessons were combined in The Voice of Isis (1912), which became the order's basic introductory text. Later a more advanced text was published under the title The Message of Aquaria (1921). The Curtisses wrote several books during World War I, including The War Crisis (1914) or The Philosophy of War, being a philosophical treatise on the mystical causes of war, and The Key to the Universe (1915). In the latter volume they contended that all personal experiences are expressions of one great law based on mathematical principles and that the \\"unfoldment of the godlike possibilities inherent in each Soul follows, step by step, the same order of events that is followed in the evolution of the Cosmos, and that such steps are symbolized by the first 22 numbers\\". Realms of the Living Dead: A Brief Description of Life after Death appeared in 1917. In 1919 they published a sequel to The Key to the Universe titled The Key of Destiny. Many more books followed in later years. During the war the Curtisses founded the Church of the Wisdom Religion, a less exclusive group than their earlier order. In 1929 after the Curtisses moved to Washington, D.C., the church was incorporated as the Universal Religious Foundation. After suffering from a long mystical illness towards the end of her life, Harriette Augusta Curtiss entered transition on the 22nd of September 1932 in Washington, D.C., and followed her Teacher, Madame Blavatsky, into the Higher Realms. She had reached the age of 76. Dr. Frank Homer Curtiss maintained a successful healing practice until his passing in 1946 and implemented a constructive and truly holistic healing practice, side by side with the highest mystical Teachings of the Order. This encompassed specialized dieting, in vogue to this day and radionics, then still in its infancy. Frank Homer Curtiss, many years younger than Harriette, re-married in 1937 to Eleanor Chapman Stevens who helped him to continue his work until his passing. She became the sole heir and executor of his estate and it is assumed the keeper of the archives of the Order at Homers passing. Homer entered transition in 1946 at the age of 71.

He is the author of the 2012 memoir Kasher in the Rye: The True Tale of a White Boy from Oakland Who Became a Drug Addict, Criminal, Mental Patient, and Then Turned 16. In 2009, iTunes named Kasher \\"Best New Comic\\" and his comedy album Everyone You Know Is Going to Die, and Then You Are! was ranked one of the top 20 comedy albums on iTunes that same year. He was also named \\"Comic to Watch in 2010\\" by Punchline Magazine.  Early life and education  Born in Queens, New York, Kasher moved to Oakland, California with his mother and brother when he was one year old. Kasher grew up in North Oakland's Temescal and Piedmont Avenue neighborhoods, and his family lived mostly on disability assistance and food stamps. A son of deaf parents, Kasher worked as a sign-language interpreter from the age of 17. His parents met at the World Games for the Deaf in 1967 and split up when Kasher was nine years old. When Kasher was four years old, his father Steven, a former painter who was born to secular, communist Jewish parents, became a Hasidic Jew in the Satmar community in Brooklyn; Steven's grandfather, originally from Hungary, was a New Square Skverer Hasid. Kasher regularly spent summers with his father in Sea Gate, Brooklyn until his death — Kasher was 20 at the time. His father lived with Gaucher's disease. Kasher's brother is a rabbi. In his autobiography Kasher in the Rye: The True Tale of a White Boy from Oakland Who Became a Drug Addict, Criminal, Mental Patient, and Then Turned 16, Kasher wrote about having been moved in and out of mental institutions from the age of 4 and using drugs from the ages of 12 to 16. He was kicked out of four different high schools. In an interview with SanDiego.com, Kasher described himself as \\"pretty straight edge,\\" stating that he has been clean \\"since I was very young.\\" He earned his G.E.D. at age 16 and later became a sign-language interpreter. Kasher attended community college in the Bay Area, where he studied theater and wrote several long-form monologues.

It is a long, lean fish with a large head, similar in appearance to the European hake and the deep-water Cape hake. By day, it lives close to the bottom on the continental shelf and upper slope at depths not usually exceeding ; it makes a large, daily vertical migration rising at night to feed in the nectonic zone, and it also migrates southwards in spring and northwards in autumn. It is an important commercial fish species in southern Africa. Description Very similar to Merluccius merluccius (European hake) and Merluccius paradoxus (the deep-water Cape hake), M. capensis has an average length around 50 cm, up to a maximum around . It is a long, lean fish with a large head, light brown above and white or silvery below. The first dorsal fin has a single spine and 9 to 11 soft rays, while the second has 38 to 43 soft rays. The anal fin has no spines and 37 to 41 soft rays. The caudal fin has a flat end or is slightly concave. Distribution Its range extends southwards around the coast and into the Indian Ocean. On the east coast, it is less abundant and is rarely found in significant numbers north of KwaZulu-Natal. On the west coast, M. capensis occurs as far north as Benguela in Angola, where its distribution overlaps that of Merluccius polli, the Benguela hake. It lives close to the bottom on the continental shelf and upper slope at depths from 50 to 500 m, usually not below 400 m. Its preferred depth partly overlaps that of Merluccius paradoxus between depths of 200 and 400 m. In South Africa, M. capensis is one of the most important commercial food fishes. It is known locally (from the Afrikaans stokvis) as stockfish, not to be confused with the dried cod usually known by that name. Ecology The shallow-water Cape hake might be classified as a euryphagous carnivore; immature specimens feed on small, deep-sea fishes and crustaceans. Large hake feed on squid and fishes, as well; smaller hake and jack mackerel are major components of their diet. available for download at http://www.fao.org The shallow-water Cape hake migrates vertically, daily, being demersal by day and nektonic by night. On a seasonal basis, it migrates southwards in spring and northwards in autumn. Spawning is variably reported either to be year-round, or to occur mainly from mid-spring to early summer. The Cape hake is often fished together with the species Merluccius paradoxus, which generally lives at greater depths. Most reported catches combine both species, but the range of M. capensis continues towards the north-west coast of southern Africa, in the region of Angola, where, for practical purposes, M. paradoxus does not occur.

Design and development In the late 1940s the Soviet forces had a need for a light liaison aircraft that was smaller than the Antonov An-2. The company derived two four-seat aircraft with wooden wings and metal fuselages, from the earlier AIR-6. The Yak-10, a high-wing strut-braced monoplane with fixed landing gear and the Yak-13 a low-wing cantilever monoplane with a manually retractable landing gear. Both aircraft were powered by a 145 hp M-11MF radial engine. After tests in 1945, the Yak-10 was awarded a production contract for 40 aircraft, despite unimpressive performance. The company built a number of different variants but soon produced an improved design, the Yak-12, which, although of similar layout, was not a derivative of the Yak-10. The Yak-10 only entered limited production before it was replaced by the superior Yakovlev Yak-12, and although the Yak-13 proved to be superior to the original Yak-10, production was not carried out.

It is a parasitoid of the citrus blackfly, Aleurocanthus woglumi, an important pest of citrus trees. It is a native of Asia but has been introduced to many other parts of the world as a means of controlling the citrus blackfly.Nguyen R. (August 2008). Citrus blackfly parasitoid, Amitus hesperidum Silvestri. Featured Creatures. EENY-243. Distribution This wasp is a native of India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Hong Kong, Szechuen, Java and Malaysia. It has been introduced to Guam, Venezuela, Mexico and the United States (Texas, Florida and Hawaii) for the purpose of controlling the citrus blackfly.Silvestri F. 1927. Contribuzione alla conoscenza degli Aleurodidae (Insecta: Hemiptera) viventi su citrus in Extremo Oriente e dei loro parasiti. Boll. Lab. Zool. Portici. 21: 1-60. Description Both males and females have a shiny black thorax and abdomen less than one millimetre long. The antennae have ten segments and in the female, the last three are widened making the antennae club-shaped. The males have longer antennae of a uniform width, curved, with all segments longer than they are wide and covered with short bristly hairs. Both antennae and legs are straw coloured and the hind tarsi have five segments. The wings are shiny and translucent. Life cycle Several offspring may develop inside a single host but this species is not polyembryonic. The eggs are laid in any of the larval stages of the citrus blackfly but the first instar is preferred. A female larval host results in the production of two or three adult wasps but parasitism of a male pupa produces only one. Parasitism of a female pupa may result in either a male or a female adult wasp. The time taken for an egg to develop into an adult varies from 45 to 60 days under laboratory conditions at a temperature of 27 °C. The wasps live for three to five days in the field during which time the female can produce up to sixty eggs. This wasp is well synchronized with its hostSynchrony and impact of Amitus hesperidum on its host, Aleurocanthus woglumi, in southern Florida and is capable of controlling dense populations of the pest. However it is not good at searching out scattered individuals and its numbers decrease sharply as its host population is controlled.Flanders SE. 1969. Herbert D. Smith's observations on citrus blackfly parasites in India and Mexico and the correlated circumstances. Canadian Entomologist 101: 467-480.

In 2008, the Internal Revenue Service set up the ROBS Compliance Project to monitor such arrangements. Background ROBS plans, while not considered an abusive tax avoidance transaction, are, according to the IRS, \\"questionable\\" because they may solely benefit one individual – the individual who rolls over his or her existing retirement 401k withdrawal funds to the ROBS plan in a tax-free transaction. Since the IRS pronouncement concerning this potentially discriminatory approach, most ROBS plans have included all participants and have provided broad-based participation for all employees. The ROBS plan then uses the rollover assets to purchase the stock of the new business. A C corporation must be set up in order to roll the 401(k) withdrawal. Promoters and facilitators, such as Roth IRA brokers of self-directed IRA LLCs, or small business financing, market IRS ROBS arrangements to prospective entrepreneurs and business owners for funding for a business as small business financing. Most have a very close relationship with the franchise industry, seeking to sell and promote business \\"opportunities\\" and find funding sources for these sales and promotions. Most ROBS promoters and facilitators pay substantial referral fees to the franchise brokers. These fees are rarely disclosed to the entrepreneur. Fees charged by most promoters are higher than would be charged by attorneys and accountants, who are prohibited from paying referral fees. Some companies offering ROBS plans do not pay referral fees to brokers, and charge lower fees as a result. There remains a substantial question whether such referral fees are illegal under ERISA and the U.S. Criminal Code: Offer, Acceptance, or Solicitation to Influence Operations of Employee Benefit Plan (18 U.S.C. Section 1954). In many cases, the broker will apply to IRS for a favorable determination letter (DL) as a way to assure their clients that the IRS approves the ROBS arrangement. The IRS issues a favorable DL if a plan's terms meet Internal Revenue Code requirements. A favorable DL does not give plan sponsors protection from incorrectly applying the plan's terms, nor from operating the plan in a discriminatory manner. When a plan sponsor administers a plan in a way that results in prohibited discrimination or engages in prohibited transactions, it can result in plan disqualification and adverse tax consequences to the plan's sponsor and its participants. Accordingly, promoters who emphasize or \\"promote\\" based on a favorable DL are, at a minimum, engaging in deceptive trade practices. ROBS Project findings New business failures Preliminary results from the ROBS Project indicate that, although there were a few success stories, most ROBS businesses either failed or were on the road to failure with high rates of bankruptcy (business and personal), liens (business and personal), and corporate dissolutions by individual Secretaries of State. Some individuals who started ROBS plans lost not only their retirement assets, accumulated over many years, but also their dream of owning a business. As a result, much of their retirement savings were depleted or 'lost', often even before they had begun trading. Specific problems There are many potential problems with ROBS. * After the ROBS plan sponsor purchases the new company's employer stock with the rollover funds, the sponsor amends the plan to prevent other participants from purchasing stock. Since the 2008 announcement from the IRS such amendments are rare. **After the DL is issued, these amendments may violate the Code qualification requirements, and raise problems with coverage, discrimination and, potentially, violations of benefits, rights and features requirements. * Promoter fees * Valuation of assets * Failure to issue a Form 1099-R when the assets are rolled over into the ROBS plan See also *American Association of Franchisees and Dealers *401(k) IRA matrix *403(b) References Internal Revenue Code Individual retirement accounts ","title":"Rollovers as business start-ups"},{"id":"30104526","text":"USS Sapphire (SP-710) was a United States Navy patrol vessel in commission from 1917 to 1918.

Early life and education Reeves was born in 1964 in Fort Hood, Texas,Senate Judiciary Committee Questionnaire: Carlton Wayne Reeves , (April 26, 2010). and was raised in rural Yazoo City, Mississippi. As a teenager, Reeves cleaned the office of U.S. District Judge William Henry Barbour, Jr., whom he would later replace on the federal bench. Reeves was the first person in his family to attend a four-year college, and graduated in 1986 magna cum laude from Jackson State University.President Obama Names Three to the United States District Court , whitehouse.gov (April 28, 2010). Reeves then attended the University of Virginia School of Law, graduating in 1989 as a Ritter Scholar. After law school, Reeves served as a law clerk for Justice Reuben V. Anderson, the first African American judge to serve on the Mississippi Supreme Court. Professional career Reeves began his legal career in 1991 as a staff attorney for the Supreme Court of Mississippi; later that year, he entered private practice as an associate at the Jackson, Mississippi office of regional law firm Phelps Dunbar. From 1995 to 2001, Reeves served as Chief of the Civil Division for the Office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi. In 2001, Reeves returned to private practice to found his own firm, Pigott Reeves Johnson, in Jackson. During his time in private practice, Reeves served on the boards of a number of civic organizations, including the ACLU of Mississippi, the Mississippi Center for Justice, and the Magnolia Bar Association. Federal judicial service On April 28, 2010, Reeves was nominated by President Barack Obama to fill a seat on the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi vacated by Judge William Henry Barbour Jr.. Reeves was confirmed by the United States Senate on December 19, 2010 by voice vote.Associated Press, Reeves confirmed as US judge for south Mississippi, (December 19, 2010). Reeves is the second African American to serve on the federal judiciary in Mississippi. He received his commission on December 20, 2010. Notable decisions Campaign for Southern Equality v. Bryant On November 25, 2014, Reeves ruled in the case of Campaign for Southern Equality v. Bryant that Mississippi’s same-sex marriage ban violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Reeves' opinion noted the connection between racism and homophobia, and how that connection had long operated to oppress both black and LGBT Mississippians. Reeves held that, just as the state's views on race had led it to oppress blacks for generations, \\"Mississippi’s traditional beliefs about gay and lesbian citizens ... [took] away fundamental rights owed to every citizen. It is time to restore those rights.\\" United States v. Butler On February 10, 2015, Reeves sentenced three young white men for their roles in the death of a 48-year-old black man named James Craig Anderson. They were part of a group that beat Anderson and then killed him by running over his body with a truck, yelling \\"white power\\" as they drove off. In handing down sentences of between 7 and 50 years in prison for the defendants, Reeves gave a widely publicized speech that remarked on how the killing of Anderson fit into Mississippi's \\"tortured past\\" of lynchings and racism. While noting that the defendants had \\"ripped off the scab of the healing scars of Mississippi,\\" Reeves asserted that the integrated, race-neutral operation of Mississippi's modern-day justice system was \\"the strongest way\\" for the state to reject the racism of the past. Barber v. Bryant On June 30, 2016, Reeves issued a ruling that halted Mississippi's Religious Liberty Accommodations Act from going into effect. The Act provided protection to entities and individuals who refused to provide marriage-related goods and services to LGBT individuals. Reeves' holding noted that \\"[r]eligious freedom was one of the building blocks of this great nation, and after the nation was torn apart, the guarantee of equal protection under [the] law was used to stitch it back together. But [the Act] does not honor that tradition of religiou[s] freedom, nor does it respect the equal dignity of all of Mississippi's citizens. It must be enjoined.\\" In June 2017 a panel of judges from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed Judge Reeves ruling in a 3-0 decision, finding that the plaintiffs lacked standing. The Religious Liberty Accommodations Act was reinstated. Moore v. Bryant On September 8, 2016, Reeves issued a ruling dismissing a lawsuit seeking to have the Mississippi state flag, which contains the Stars and Bars emblem of the Confederacy declared unconstitutional. The basis of the dismissal is the plaintiff's failure to allege a specific injury and thus an inability to demonstrate the standing necessary to bring an action in federal court.Moore v. Bryant (Case No. 3:16-CV-151-CWR-FKB S.D. Miss. September 8, 2016). Jackson v. Currier On November 20, 2018, Reeves issued a written ruling in Jackson Women's Health Organization v. Currier (Mary Currier in her official capacity as the State Health Officer of the State of Mississippi). The ruling struck down a Mississippi law, passed in March 2018, that outlawed most abortions after the 15th week of pregnancy. Reeves had previously issued an injunction, effectively preventing the law from taking effect. His ruling included strong statements about the law, calling it \\"pure gaslighting\\" as well as an unconstitutional limitation on women's due-process rights. His ruling also invalidated a similar Louisiana law, which had been written as contingent on the outcome of the Mississippi lawsuit. Jamison v McClendon On August 4, 2020, Reeves wrote an opinion upholding the grant of qualified immunity in a case against a Richmond, Virginia police officer. The opinion stated that the two-hour traffic stop of Clarence Jamison by Officer Nick McClendon should have resulted in a Fourth Amendment violation, but he was limited to uphold prior decisions by the US Supreme Court. Reeves' ruling gives a history of minority deaths that have occurred over the decades, and argues that the doctrine of qualified immunity must be done away with. Austin Sarat, writing in Justia, compares Reeves' opinion to \\"great dissents written by Supreme Court justices\\". CNN quotes a portion of the opinion: Current cases Governor Phil Bryant signed a law scheduled to go into effect on July 1, 2019, that would ban abortions later than six weeks of pregnancy. The Center for Reproductive Rights in Jackson, Mississippi challenged the law. Because of his decision finding the prior, less restrictive, \\"15-week\\" law in the Currier case to be unconstitutional, Reeves began his decision by writing, \\"Here we go again. Mississippi has passed another law banning abortions prior to viability.\\" He inquired, \\"Doesn't it boil down to six is less than fifteen?\\", adding that the new law \\"smacks of defiance to this court.\\" Reeves noted that although there were exceptions for situations where the mother's life or health is endangered should pregnancy be taken to term, the law does not allow for exceptions in the cases of pregnancies resulting from rape or incest.Federal judge's questions point toward striking down Mississippi's latest abortion ban, \\"Clarion Ledger\\", Sarah Fowler, May 21, 2019.

It was founded by John F. Feldhusen in 1977 and is situated in the College of Education, Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. GERI's mission is holistic development of giftedness, creativity, and talent among individuals throughout their lifespan. This is accomplished through enrichment programs for talented youth, graduate programs for future scholars and leaders, professional development and coursework for educators, and ongoing research on the psychology of giftedness, creativity, and talent development. GERI faculty and staff work with P-12 educators in developing and improving services for gifted, creative, and talented children, as well as training school teachers and administrators in gifted education. In addition, GERI has developed several programs for talented youth. The Super Saturday program, a six-week enrichment program, was created in the spring of 1976. In 1977, GERI began Summer Residential Camps, aimed at providing a preview of college life to talented students. __TOC__  Talent development programs  The talent development programs at GERI help talented students explore their areas of interest in a college atmosphere where they study topics typically not offered in school. Together, students learn challenging content and create meaningful projects in which they apply their learning in new and relevant ways. Participation in GERI programs provides students in-depth and clear understanding of the fields they might like to pursue. Many students attend GERI Talent Development Programs for multiple years.  Summer residential camps  Every summer, for over 34 years, GERI has engaged gifted, creative, and talented students from across the country and around the world in residential camps designed to stimulate their imagination and expand their abilities. Students who have completed grades 5 through 12 live in campus residence halls, take challenging courses, and participate in engaging recreational activities. GERI offers three programs each summer. * Comet, 1 week sessions: For students who have completed grade 5–6. * Star, 2 week sessions: For students who have completed grades 7–8. * Pulsar, 2 week sessions: For students who have completed grades 9-12. The application process includes: * Completing the application form. * Creating a one-to two-page essay or alternative media (such as a Web site, PowerPoint presentation, or art portfolio) that addresses the applicant's desire and motivation to participate. * Submitting evidence of notable ability, achievement, or involvement in the areas of study as detailed in the program brochure. Such evidence can include grades, test scores, letters of recommendation, and awards.  Super Summer and Super Saturday programs  The Super Summer and Super Saturday programs are two enrichment programs designed to meet the needs of academically, creatively, and artistically gifted students from Pre- Kindergarten (age 4) through grade 8. The courses include science, technology, engineering, mathematics, visual and performing arts, as well as original interdisciplinary studies. Super Saturday is offered both fall and spring semesters for six Saturdays, and Super Summer is offered week days during the summer for two, one-week sessions. Research on these programs found that students had positive experiences, learned new, above-grade-level concepts, and participated in interactive learning.  Graduate programs   Ph.D. and master's  The internationally recognized Ph.D. and master's degree programs in gifted, creative, and talented studies attract students from across the country and around the world. Working closely with faculty scholars as mentors, students prepare for productive leadership roles in research, teaching, and program development. Funding may be available to support exceptional students pursuing full-time Ph.D. study.  Licensure  The accredited licensure program is available online and on campus for teachers interested in adding a high-ability license to their Indiana teaching credentials or as a certificate in gifted, creative, and talented studies for educators in other states and countries. In this program, educators develop the knowledge and skills to meet the cognitive, affective, and social needs of gifted, creative and talented learners. They learn to how to develop and differentiate curriculum and instruction; and they prepare for leadership and teaching roles in working with and developing programs for gifted, creative, and talented students  Research  The faculty and graduate students at GERI engage in cutting-edge research that informs and influences theory and practice.

Its geographic range is largely coincident with the Azawagh region.Paris, 1995  Description  The area of the Iullemmeden Basin seems to have started to subside in Permo-Triassic times, and to have experienced gradual downwarping during the Late Cretaceous to Paleogene times, while steadily filling with sediment. Two prominent fault trends run NNE-SSW through the center of the basin, while WSW-ENE faults trends are found in the northeast of the basin near the Aïr Mountains.  Stratigraphy  The sediments from Cambrian to Pleistocene times are thick, with alternating layers formed when the basin was undersea and above sea level. Potentially valuable minerals include uranium and copper ores and coal and salt deposits. Niger is one of the world's largest producers of uranium.

He is credited with being the first Vice President from the Northern Region of Malawi. The three previous vice presidents came from the central and southern regions. Kachali previously held a number of cabinet positions between 2004 and 2010. Early life and education Khumbo Kachali was born in 1966 and attended Phwezi Secondary School. He subsequently obtained a Diploma in Project Management from the University of Cambridge, England. He obtained his Master of Science Degree in Strategic Management in 2011 from the University of Derby, England. For his MSc thesis, he wrote a paper titled the Impact of Multiparty Politics on the socio-economic lives of people using his Mzimba constituency as a case study. Derby University of the UK proudly announced their former student and academic product's ascendancy to Malawi's vice presidency on its university website on 13 April 2012. Before entering politics, Kachali was Second Vice-President for the Malawi Chamber of Commerce and Industry and he has been a businessman for years running various enterprises based in Mzuzu and large farming enterprise in Mzimba, his home district. Kachali is a well known Philanthropist assisting many people in education, start-up business capitals and Religious work Political career Kachali was Treasurer General for the United Democratic Front (UDF) from 2002 to 2004. Kachali was elected to parliament in May 2004. In 2005 he was appointed as Second Vice-President of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). He was Minister of Industry, Science & Technology (2004-2006), Deputy Minister for Home Affairs & Internal Security (2006-2007) and Minister of Youth Development & Sports (2007-2008). From 2008 until 2009 he was Minister of Health.He is credited to have been one of very few effective Health Ministers bringing together all health sector partners to provide quality services. As Vice President, he would later use this experience as minister of health to quell a health staff boycott over allowances at Kamuzu Central Hospital in June 2012. His return also saw the return of essential drugs into Malawi public hospitals which are the largest healthcare services for the poor after months of pharmacies running dry. Kachali was appointed Minister of Transport and Public Infrastructure in the cabinet that became effective on 15 June 2009. He lost his ministerial position in the cabinet shake-up of 9 August 2010. As Vice President Kachali has been seen as a workhorse of the Joyce Banda administration being delegated to handle controversial and political matters including scandals involving fellow Cabinet Members, management of food shortages and political negotiations with some of the key political leaders. Kachali is credited for engineering defections of high-profile opposition leaders to the ruling Peoples Party. Internally though, some Peoples Party founders and their stooges have been working hard to tarnish his image by fermenting lies or putting up independent candidates in the recent bye-elections in his Mzimba South West Constituency and Mzimba Central where they expected the PP to lose and discredit him. The PP won his former constituency with a majority of over 5000 sending his detractors into political wilderness. He is one of the political heavy weights in the northern region of Malawi. He represented Malawi at the African Union summit in the year 2012 where he helped champion the election of the first female AU Chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma through his well documented support for women empowerment. He also left a landmark on the diplomatic scene by being President Banda's vocal face on the banning of Sudan's fugitive president Al Bashir from attending the initially Malawi bound 2012 AU summit that was as a consequence of the landmark ban transferred to Ethiopia. His unprecedented hand-pick appointment has raised questions as to whether he enjoys the same immunity that his elected predecessors had over being fired by a standing president. Two of his predecessors, Joyce Banda and Cassim Chilumpha were on separate occasions only saved by the constitution when the then vexed president wanted their heads to roll for what may best be described by some as alleged political insecurities or machinations. As First Vice President of the ruling Peoples Party, he has been at the centre of bringing parliamentary and political stability and he is regarded as \\"the most loyal and trusted\\" boy of President Joyce Banda and that has earned him constant attacks from his political competitors who believe attacking him would weaken the President who is set for her first Presidential election in May 2014. Rt. Hon. Khumbo Kachali is now the President and founding member of Freedom Party which was registered with the Registrar of Political parties in Malawi in the year 2017.

NEFEW's musical style is often compared to artists such as Common, Kanye West, 9th Wonder, Kenn Starr and Talib Kweli. Many of the group's productions contain soulful samples, as well as jazz keys and string arrangements. Career 2007–2010: First album and Puma deal After changing their name to NEFEW, the group took their first big step in 2007, releasing their debut studio album called Off the Cuff, which contains the track Admit It, a collaboration with Brooklyn rappers Wordsworth and Masta Ace. The album received mixed reviews from music critics. musicOMH gave it 2 out of 5 stars, while UK Hip Hop calls it a \\"well-intentioned if unsurprising slice of underground rap\\". In December 2009, Puma began to support NEFEW in the matter of promotion. This allowed the independent duo to reach a much higher number of fans. Nefew are the first hip hop act to be endorsed by the company. Also, Nefew revealed in several interviews that they were negotiating with two major labels. Yet, no record deal is official. With Puma supporting the group, however, NEFEW released an EP. It was available only on iTunes Music Store. The track Biko features R&B; singer Chanj and former GOOD Music signee Consequence, and held number two position in the US College Radio Charts. 2010–2014: Antihero trilogy Antihero Begins came out in April 2010 as a free mixtape. The record had considerable success, not least of all because it was published on highly respected hip hop blog 2dopeboyz.com. Also, Antihero Begins received general acclaim from music critics. Okayplayer gave it 89 out of 100 points: '''' After Antihero Begins DJ Green Lantern took notice of the groups work and came up with the idea of a collaboration. In January 2011, Man Vs Many, which is hosted by DJ Green Lantern, was released. Among others, the mixtape features soul singer Dwele and Rapper Nottz. The album was later re- released as a digital album. In October 2011, Nefew released the EP Transitions with German producer 7inch. The EP \\"For Hip Hop\\", a collaboration with Nottz and Shakes, followed in 2012. The most recent studio album is called Rise of the Antihero (released in November 2014). It features various notable artists such as BJ the Chicago Kid, Jared Evan and STS Gold. The album peaked at No. 37 on the Swiss album charts. Nefew intends to release another studio album (The Antihero), concluding the Antihero trilogy. 2015–present: Empire deal Nefew joined forces with record label Empire in 2016. Shortly thereafter, Slides EP was released.

Formally, a query q over a schema R is monotonic if and only if for every two instances I, J of R, I \\\\subseteq J \\\\Rightarrow q(I) \\\\subseteq q(J) (q must be a monotonic function). An example of a monotonic query is a select-project-join query containing only conditions of equality (also known as conjunctive queries). Examples of non-monotonic queries are aggregation queries, or queries with set difference. Identifying whether a query is monotonic can be crucial for query optimization, especially in view maintenance and data stream management. Since the answer set for a monotonic query can only grow as more tuples are added to the database, query processing may be optimized by executing only the new portions of the database and adding the new results to the existing answer set.  Applications   Unnesting Queries  Monotonic queries are important in the topic of unnesting SQL queries. If a query is monotonic, it implies that a nested query can actually be unnested.  Data streams  A data stream is a real-time, continuous, ordered (implicitly by arrival time or explicitly by timestamp) sequence of items. The number of items is considered to be infinite and therefore cannot feasibly be stored in its entirety. Queries over data streams are often called continuous or long-running queries, and are mostly run over a limited window of tuples in the stream. To evaluate a continuous query, one can simply reevaluate the query over newly arrived tuples, and append the new tuples to the existing result set. More formally, let A(Q, t) be the answer set of a continuous query Q at time t, τ be the current time, and 0 the start time. Then, if Q is monotonic, its result set at time τ is : A(Q, \\\\tau) =\\\\bigcup_{t = 1}^{\\\\tau} (A(Q,t) - A(Q, t-1)) \\\\cup A(Q,0) In contrast, non-montonic queries have the following answer semantics: : A(Q, \\\\tau) =\\\\bigcup_{t = 0}^{\\\\tau} A(Q,t)  View maintenance  Database theory ","title":"Monotonic query"},{"id":"30104999","text":"' (Sing a new song to the Lord), BWV 90.2, BWV190a',Work at Bach Digital website. is a cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach.

Despite playing only on two songs Kessler was credited as a full time member in the liner notes. He was trained in classical and Latin guitar. These styles provided a great understanding of music theory and also taught him to read standard notation. Later, Tommy drifted into the direction of the hard rock masters such as Randy Rhoads, Slash, Steve Vai, Eddie Van Halen and Dimebag Darrell. His natural talent of learning pieces very quickly by sight reading or memorizing by ear helped him quickly excel in that scene. Kessler's first steady gig in NYC was playing in the word-renowned Blue Man Group where he played Zither, Guitar, bass and The Stick. He has also been part of the band in the New York City of Blue Man Group since 2006.http://www.gigslutz.co.uk/interview-tommy-kessler-blondie/ Kessler also performs as a guitarist in the fictional 1980s rock band Arsenal in the Broadway musical, Rock of Ages, a member since it opened off Broadway in 2008. His abilities have resulted in a reputation for excellence that has led to him becoming a highly sought after session guitarist in NYC since moving there in 2005. Being in Rock of Ages led to him meeting Blondie. He was recommended by the band's keyboardist Matt Katz-Bohen. In 2015, Kessler was asked to be a part of the “Fresh Kids of Bel-Air”. He performs regularly at (Le) Poisson Rouge. Kessler served as musical director for the 2011 Glamour Women of the Year Awards. He has written and produced music for The Nickelodeon Network (iCarly and Victorious). Kessler mixed Joel Hoekstra's Joel Hoekstra's 13: Dying to Live.

Ross. A three-story construction approximately by in size, it is recorded as being built in 1895. Constructed of brick, the architectural style has been described as Commercial vernacular. The building, which is at the northern extremity of the historic commercial district, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. History The building was constructed at a cost of US$17,000 for a woolen mill business that had started to trade in 1892. It was situated on a x plot, which was a typical size for a development area in Grand Forks at that time. It was used for various processes involved in the conversion of wool to cloth, including carding, spinning, weaving, dyeing and sewing. It also contained offices and retail space. A historical survey observed that the building was \\"the object of intense pride ... a local symbol of economic independence from Minnesota, and the focus of Grand Forks' hopes of becoming a manufacturing center.\\" The presence of the mill removed the necessity to ship wool to Minneapolis for conversion, and so it enabled both higher payments to local farmers for their raw materials and lower prices to consumers. The woolen business, which at one point employed 75 people, was a fairly short-lived venture. It ceased operations some time between 1901 and 1906 as it became impossible for it to compete with larger enterprises such as the North Star Woolen Mill in Minneapolis, its Grand Forks location being too distant both from sufficient supplies of raw wool and from consumer markets. A single-story extension was added on the northern aspect. In 1916 the building was gutted by fire. Following the fire, the one-story addition was destroyed. However, with the walls still standing, the main building was rebuilt using a fire-proof construction method in 1918 and at that point included a concrete floor. It was then used for many years as a garage for Hanson Ford.

The following characteristics should be considered when selecting a nozzle:A.H. Lefebvre, Atomization and Sprays, 1989, * Spray Pattern * Capacity * Spray impact * Spray Angle * Drop Size  Spray Pattern  Selecting a nozzle based on the pattern and other spray characteristics that are required generally yields good results.Lipp, Charles W. , Practical Spray Technology: Fundamentals and Practice , 2012, Since spray nozzles are designed to perform under many different spraying conditions, more than one nozzle may meet the requirements for a given application. Surfaces may be sprayed with any pattern shape. Results are fairly predictable, depending on the type of spray pattern specified. If the surface is stationary, the preferred nozzle is usually some type of full cone nozzle, since its pattern will cover a larger area than the other styles. Spatial applications, in which the objective is not primarily to spray onto a surface, are more likely to require specialized spray characteristics. Success in these applications is often completely dependent on factors such as drop size and spray velocity. Evaporation, cooling rates for gases and solids, and cleaning efficiency are examples of process characteristics that may depend largely on spray qualities. Flat fan, Solid cone and Hollow cone spray patterns Each spray pattern is described below with typical end use applications.  Solid Stream  This type of nozzle provides a high impact per unit area and is used in many cleaning applications, for example, tank-cleaning nozzles (fixed or rotary).  Hollow Cone  This spray pattern is a circular ring of liquid. The pattern is achieved by the use of an inlet orifice tangential to a cylindrical swirl chamber that is open at one end. The circular orifice exit has a diameter smaller than the swirl chamber. The whirling liquid results in a circular shape; the center of the ring is hollow. Hollow cone nozzles are best for applications requiring good atomization of liquids at low pressures or when quick heat transfer is needed. These nozzles also feature large and unobstructed flow passages, which provide a relatively high resistance to clogging. Hollow cone nozzles provide the smallest drop size distributions. The relative range of drop sizes tends to be narrower than other hydraulic styles. The hollow cone pattern is also achievable by the spiral design of nozzle. This nozzle impinges the fluid upon a protruding spiral. This spiral shape breaks the fluid apart into several hollow cone patterns. By altering the topology of the spiral the hollow cone patterns can be made to converge to form a single hollow cone.  Full Cone  Full cone nozzles yield complete spray coverage in a round, oval or square shaped area. Usually the liquid is swirled within the nozzle and mixed with non-spinning liquid that has bypassed an internal vane. Liquid then exits through an orifice, forming a conical pattern. Spray angle and liquid distribution within the cone pattern depend on the vane design and location relative to the exit orifice. The exit orifice design and the relative geometric proportions also affect the spray angle and distribution. Full cone nozzles provide a uniform spray distribution of medium to large size drops resulting from their core design, which features large flow passages. Full cone nozzles are the style most extensively used in industry. Flat Spray As the name implies, the spray pattern appears as a flat sheet of liquid. The pattern is formed by an elliptical or a round orifice on a deflective surface that is tangent to the exit orifice. The orifice has an external groove with a contoured internal cylindrical radius, or “cat’s eye” shape. In the elliptical orifice design, the pattern sprays out of the orifice in line with the pipe. In the deflector design, the spray pattern is perpendicular to the pipe. There are two categories of flat spray, tapered and even, depending on the uniformity of the spray over the spray pattern. Flat spray patterns with tapering edges are produced by straight- through elliptical spray nozzles. This spray pattern is useful for overlapping patterns between multiple nozzle headers. The result is uniform distribution across the entire sprayed surface. Non-tapered flat spray nozzles are used in cleaning applications that require a uniform spray pattern without any overlap in spray area. Multiple Plume Spray Multiple Plume Spray Multiple plume sprays are routinely used in automotive injectors. The multiple plumes are primarily used to provide for the optimal mixing of fuel and air so as to reduce pollutant emission under different operating conditions. The multiple plume automotive injectors can have anywhere from 2 to 8 plumes. The precise location of the centroid of these plumes, the individual plume angles, and the percentage split of the liquid amongst the plumes are normally obtained using an optical patternator.  Capacity  Spray nozzle manufacturers all tabulate capacity based on water. Since the specific gravity of a liquid affects its flow rate, the values must be adjusted using the equation below, where Qw is the water capacity and Spg is the specific gravity of the fluid used resulting the volumetric flow rate of the fluid used Qf. Q_f = {Q_w}/\\\\sqrt {S{p_g}} \\\\ Nozzle capacity varies with spraying pressure. In general, the relationship between capacity and pressure is as follows: {Q_2} = {Q_1}\\\\sqrt {P_2/ P_1} where Q1 is the known capacity at pressure P1, and Q2 is the capacity to be determined at pressure P2. Spray Impact Impact of a spray onto the target surface is expressed as the force/area, N/m2 or lb/in2. This value depends on the spray pattern distribution and the spray angle. Generally, solid stream nozzles or narrow spray angle flat fan nozzles are used for applications in which high impact is desired, such as cleaning. When a nozzle is used for cleaning, the impact or pressure is called impingement. As with all spray patterns, the unit impact decreases as the distance from the nozzle increases, thereby increasing the impact area size. The spray impact, F_l, depends on the volumetric flowrate Q and pressure drop according to the equation below. The nozzle type and distance between the nozzle and surface affect the constant C. {F_l} = CQ\\\\sqrt {\\\\Delta P} Spray Angle and Coverage The spray angle diverges or converges with respect to the vertical axis. As illustrated in the figure below, the spray angle tends to collapse or diverge with increasing distance from the orifice. Spray coverage varies with spray angle. The theoretical coverage, C, of spray patterns at various distances may be calculated with the equation below for spray angles less than 180 degrees. The spray angle is assumed to remain constant throughout the entire spray distance. Liquids more viscous than water form smaller spray angles, or solid streams, depending upon nozzle capacity, spray pressure, and viscosity. Liquids with surface tensions lower than water produce wider spray angles than those listed for water. Spray angles are typically measured using optical or mechanical methods. The optical methods include shadowgraphy, extinction tomography, and Mie Imaging.Sivathanu et al., Atomization and Sprays, vol. 20, pp. 85-92. Sprays angles are important in coating applications to prevent overspraying of the coated materials, in combustion engines to prevent wetting of the cylinder walls, and in fire sprinklers to provide adequate coverage of the protected property. Spray coverage {C} = 2D\\\\tan (\\\\theta/2) Spray Drop Size The drop size is the size of the spray drops that make up the nozzle’s spray pattern.Rudolf J. Schick, An Engineer’s Practical Guide to Drop Size Spraying Systems Co. [2009] The spray drops within a given spray are not all the same size. There are several ways to describe the drop sizes within a spray: • Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) or D32 * Fineness of spray expressed in terms of surface area produced by the spray. * Diameter of a drop with the same volume-to-surface area ratio as the total volume of all the drops to the total surface area of all the drops . • Volume Median Diameter (VMD) DV0.5 and Mass Median Diameter (MMD) * Drop size expressed in terms of the volume of liquid sprayed. * Drop size measured in terms of volume (or mass), with 50% of total volume of liquid sprayed drops with diameters larger than median value and 50% with smaller diameter. Drop sizes are stated in micrometers (µm). One micrometer equals 1/25,400 inch. Drop Size Distribution The size and/or volume distribution of drops in a spray is typically expressed by the size versus the cumulative volume percent. cumulative drop size distribution graph {RSF} = \\\\frac {D_{V0.9} - D_{V0.1}} {D_{V0.5}} Relative Span Factor Comparing drop size distributions from alternate nozzles can be confusing. The Relative Span Factor (RSF) reduces the distribution to a single number. The parameter indicates the uniformity of the drop size distribution. The closer this number is to zero, the more uniform the spray will be (i.e. tightest distribution, smallest variance from the maximum drop size, Dmax, to the minimum drop size, Dmin ). RSF provides a practical means for comparing various drop size distributions. Drop size measurement Sprays are typically characterized by statistical quantities obtained from size and velocity measurements over many individual droplets. The most widely used quantities are size and velocity probability density distributions as well as fluxes, e.g., number, mass, momentum etc. Through a given plane, some instruments infer such statistical quantities from individual measurements, e.g., number density from light extinction, but very few instruments are capable of making direct size and velocity measurements of individual droplets in a spray( Kalantari and Tropea, 2007). The three most widely used methods of drop size measurements are laser diffraction, optical imaging, and phase Doppler. All of these optical methods are non-intrusive. If all the drops had the same velocity, the measurements of drop size would be the identical for all methods. However, there is a significant difference between the velocity of larger and smaller drops. These optical methods are classified as either spatial or flux based. A spatial sampling method measures the drops in a finite measurement volume. The residence time of drops in the measurement volume affects the results. The flux-based methods sample continually over a measurement cross-section. Laser diffraction,E. Dan Hirleman, W.D. Bachalo, Philip G. Fenton, editors, Liquid Particle Size Measurement Techniques 2nd Volume, ASTM STP 1083, 1990 a spatial sampling method, relies on the principle of Fraunhofer diffraction, which is caused by the light interacting with the drops in the spray. The scattering angle of the diffraction pattern is inversely related to the size of the drop. This nonintrusive method utilizes a long cylindrical optical probe volume. The scattered light passes through a special transforming lens system and is collected on a number of concentric photodiode rings. The signal from the photodiodes is used to back-calculate a drop size distribution. A number of lenses allow measurements from 1.2 to 1800 µm. The optical imaging method uses a pulsed light, laser or strobe, to generate the shadow graphic image used to determine the size of the drop in the measurement volume. This spatial measurement method has a range from 5 µm to 10,000 µm with lens and optical configuration changes. Image analysis software processes the raw images to determine a circular equivalent drop diameter. This method is best suited to quantify larger diameter drops in medium to low density sprays, opaque liquids (slurries), and ligaments (partially formed drops). Phase Doppler,H.-E. Albrecht, M. Borys, N. Damaschke, C. Tropea, Laser Doppler and Phase Doppler Measurement Techniques, 2003, a flux-based method, measures particle size and velocity simultaneously. This method, also known as PDPA, is unique because the drop size and velocity information is in the phase angle between the detector signals and the signal frequency shift. Because this method is not sensitive to intensity, it is used in more dense sprays. The range of drop sizes is 1 to 8000 µm. At the heart of the method are crossed laser beams that create interference patterns (regular spaced pattern of light and dark lines) and illuminate drops as they pass through the small measurement zone. A series of three off axis detectors collects the optical signal that is used to determine the phase angle and frequency shift caused by the drops. Optical imaging and phase Doppler methods measure the size of individual drops. A sufficient number of drops (order of magnitude 10,000 drops) must be quantified to produce a representative distribution and to minimize the effect of random fluctuations. Often several measurement locations in a spray are necessary because the drop size varies over the spray cross-section. Factors Affecting Drop Size Nozzle type and capacity: Full cone nozzles have the largest drop size, followed by flat spray nozzles. Hollow cone nozzles produce the smallest drop size. Spraying pressure: Drop size increases with lower spraying pressure and decreases with higher pressure. Flow rate: Flow rate has a direct effect on drop size. An increase in flow rate will increase the pressure drop and decrease the drop size, while a decrease in flow rate will decrease the pressure drop and increase the drop size. Spray angle: Spray angle has an inverse effect on drop size. An increase in spray angle will reduce the drop size, whereas a reduction in spray angle will increase the drop size. Liquid properties: Viscosity and surface tension increase the amount of energy required to atomize the spray. An increase in any of these properties will typically increase the drop size. Within each type of spray pattern the smallest capacities produce the smallest spray drops, and the largest capacities produce the largest spray drops. Volume Median Diameter (VMD) is based on the volume of liquid sprayed; therefore, it is a widely accepted measure Spray Drop Surface Area Density The drop surface area density is the product of the spray drop surface area and the number of drops per unit volume. The surface area density is very important in evaporation and combustion applications since the local evaporation rate is highly correlated to the surface area density. The extinction of light caused by the drops within a spray is also directly proportion to the surface area density. The two most widely used methods of measuring the surface area density are Laser Sheet Imaging and Statistical Extinction Tomography.Lim, J., and Sivathanu, Y., “Optical Patternation of a Multi-hole Fuel Spray Nozzle,” Atomization and Sprays, vol. 15, pp. 687-698, 2005 Practical Considerations Drop size data depend on many variables, and are always subject to interpretation. The following guidelines are suggested to facilitate understanding and effective use of the drop size data. Data collection repeatability and accuracy An average value drop size test result is repeatable if the data from individual tests do not deviate by more than ±10%; however, this may be larger or smaller depending on several factors. Accuracy requires a primary standard which is not available for spray measurements. Instrumentation and reporting bias To make valid data comparisons, particularly from different sources, it is extremely important to know the type of instrument and range used, the sampling technique, and the percent volume for each size class. Instrumentation and reporting bias directly affect drop size data. Consider the Application Select the drop size mean and diameter of interest that is best suited for the application. If the object is simply to compare the drop size of alternate nozzles, then the VMD or SMD report are sufficient. Additional information such as RSF, DV90, DV10, and others should be used when appropriate.

After joining the Purdue University faculty in 1930, he helped to build the University's School of Chemical Engineering, the Purdue-Taiwan Engineering Project, and National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan.Biographical Note, Randolph Norris Shreve papers, 1900-1984, from Purdue University Library website, www4.lib.purdue.edu, accessed 2010-12-17. He and his wife Eleanor are the namesakes of the Shreve Professorship of Organic Technology and Shreve Residence Hall at Purdue, and Shreve Hall on the Cheng Kung University campus.John Norberg, “Three Tigers and Purdue,” p. 136-62 (1999). He is the namesake of the Norris Shreve Award for Outstanding Teaching in Chemical Engineering. Shreve was born in St. Louis, Missouri on March 9, 1885.Nicholas A. Peppas, “One Hundred Years of Chemical Engineering,” p. 126-28 (1989) . After graduating from Ferguson High School in Ferguson, Missouri, he was unable to afford college, and instead began work as a laboratory boy at the Mallinckrodt Chemical Works in St. Louis, where he learned chemistry from Charles Luedeking and William Lamar. Mallinckrodt loaned him enough money to allow him to attend Harvard University, where he graduated summa cum laude in 1907 after only three years of attendance (a record at Harvard that would remain for more than 40 years). After graduating, he returned to Mallinckrodt, where he became a chemist in the alkaloidal department. Lamar and Shreve left Mallinckrodt and St. Louis in 1911 for northern New Jersey, where Lamar founded Lamar Chemical Works, which Shreve soon took over. At age 29, he founded Shreve Chemical Company, before becoming a chemical engineering consultant in 1919. In 1923 Shreve became the chief stockholder and president of Ammonite Company, which was then based at the Nixon Nitration Works in what is now Edison, New Jersey. On March 1, 1924, Ammonite, which was involved in extracting ammonium nitrate from shells from the Raritan Arsenal, triggered a massive explosion and resulting fire (known as the 1924 Nixon Nitration Works disaster) that destroyed the Nitration Works. This led to the dissolution of Ammonite in 1926. Shreve joined the Purdue University College of Engineering faculty in 1930, becoming a full professor the next year. He defined his main research field as “organic chemical technology.” Rising through the ranks, he chaired the School of Chemical Engineering from 1947 to 1951. He has been recognized as “the main proponent of teaching industrial chemistry in U.S. chemical engineering departments in the second quarter of the 20th century.” In 1951 he became director of the Purdue-Taiwan Engineering Project, which was intended to improve engineering education in Taiwan, modernize its industries, and improve connections between its colleges of engineering and industries. This also played an important role in the modernization of Taiwan Provincial College of Engineering into Taiwan Provincial Cheng Kung University. From 1952 until 1961, he and his wife spent several months each year in Taiwan assisting the University's development. In 1961, he became a professor emeritus, and was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Engineering from Purdue. Shreve is holder or co-holder of five patents. He wrote several books, most notably Chemical Process Industries, a major text now in its fifth edition.R. Norris Shreve, “Shreve’s Chemical Process Industries″ (5th ed. 1998), .

It no longer holds membership of the Camanachd Association and has not fielded a senior side or a ladies' side for several years. However, it has youth teams which compete from time to time. History Shinty was traditionally played, as in other Highland areas, at New Year. One game was notorious for being cancelled due to fighting and indeed a man was alleged to have committed murder at one game in the 1830s. Kintyre was formed in 1985 and won the South Division Four Championship in 1992. The club also played a team from Islay for the Camanachd Ile Cup around the early 90s. The club has had a history of abeyance, hampered by the remoteness of the Mull of Kintyre. The Under 17 side sometimes play in the South Area League. Some older players go to Kilmory Camanachd to play at a senior level. Shinty is being kept alive in Kintyre by the ladies' team although they have not entered competition since 2009. A campaign to get an all-weather park for Campbeltown has been a success and may help assist the club reach senior status again.

The ancient site is some 7 kilometers south- east of Tzintzuntzan, on the south-eastern shore of the Lake Pátzcuaro. Human settlements vestiges are registered from two different occupational periods; the first occurred between 900 and 1200 CE, corresponding to Nahuatl language speaking groups; the second group corresponding to the maximum development reached by the Purépecha Culture, between 1200 and 1530 CE. This archaeological site was built on an artificially leveled plateau, and it is considered very important, for the Michoacán prehispanic history, it was an astronomical observatory and ceremonial center. Although it is relatively small, the pyramids dedicated to \\"Curicaueri\\" and \\"Xaratanga\\" are remarkable. A sculpture representing a Chac MoolChac-Mool is the name given to a type of Prehispanic Mesoamerican stone statue, it depicts a human figure in a reclining position with the head up and turned to one side, holding a tray over the stomach. Chac-Mool statues are found in or around temples in Toltec and other post-Classic central Mexican sites, and in post-Classic Maya civilization sites with heavy Toltec influence, such as Chichen Itza. (Toltec culture characteristic element) was found; as well as a series of roads and walls surrounding the site. The prehispanic settlement fully covers a low- lying plateau and kept a strategic location at the extreme west of the Lake and other dominant sites as Tzintzuntzan. Background According to the archeological evidence, there has been human habitation within the territory of Michoacán state for at least 10,000 years. In prehispanic times there were a number of migration waves into the area including the Pirinda, Nahua, Huetamo, Colima, Purépecha and other peoples. There are sites of formal settlements from all Mesoamerican period. Important sites include El Opeño and those in Curutarán, Tepalcatepec Apatzingán, Zinapécuaro and Coalcoman. The territory has been inhabited by the Nahuas, Otomis, Matlatzincas, Pirindas and Tecos as well as the Purépecha. The main prehispanic civilization of the state is that of the Purépecha, which was centered in the Lake Pátzcuaro area. Before the 13th century, both Nahua and Purépecha peoples were here, sustaining themselves by agriculture and fishing. The Purépecha are descendants of a late arrival of Chichimecas who came from the north. At Lake Pátzcuaro, they came upon people with similar cultures to their own but who were more technically and socially advanced. The formation of the Purépecha state began in the 13th century, when these people started their own dominion at Uayameo, today Santa Fe de la Laguna and becoming dominant over the entire Lake Pátzcuaro area by the 15th century. Conquest of neighboring tribes and territories occurred between 1401 and 1450, absorbing peoples with different cultures and languages into the empire. By the late 15th century, this state rivaled that of the Aztecs, expanding their territory over much of what is now Michoacán and into part of Colima, Nayarit, Querétaro, Guanajuato, Guerrero and Jalisco. The Aztecs attempted to invade Purépecha but were repelled. This would later cause the Purépecha to deny the Aztecs aid in the defense of Tenochtitlan against the Spanish. The history of Michoacán has been studied from archaeological remains and other historical resources, such as the literary work \\"Relación de Michoacán\\" written in 1542, and it is known that the first settlers of the state were several Chichimeca tribes which arrived in different epochs and consequently evolved differently. The archeological sites found in the state, have helped clarify the history of the birth and development of ethnic groups which provided the essence of the Michoacán culture, dating back to the formative or Preclassical period (1500 to 200 BCE), the classical (800 BCE to 800 CE) and Postclassical (800 to 1000 CE), among whose sites are included: El Opeño, Curutarán, la Villita, Tepalcatepec, Apatzingán, Zinapécuaro, Coalcomán, San Felipe de los Alzati, Tzintzuntzan, Tingambato, Pátzcuaro, Zacapu, Uruapan, Tzitzio, etc. The Michoacán territory was inhabited by the Purépecha people, which developed as a dominant culture and imposed their economic, religious, military and cultural hegemony to other ethnic groups who also inhabited the region, as the Nahua, Otomi, Matlatzincas or Pirindas and Tecos. In the region, in addition to the Tarascan or Purépecha language, Coacomeca, Xilotlazinca Colimote dialects, Pirinda, Mazahua, Sayulteco, Nahuatl and Teca were spoken. The area has been inhabited at least since the early Pre-classic period. Early lithic evidence from before 2500 BC like fluted points and stone utensils are found at some Megafauna kill sites. The earliest radio-carbon dates of archeological sites fall around 1200 BC. The best known early preclassical culture of Michoacán was the Chupicuaro culture. Chupícuaro sites are mostly found on lake islands which can be seen as a sign of it having traits relating it to the later Tarascan cultural patterns. In the early Classical period, ballcourts and other artifacts demonstrate a Teotihuacan influence in the Michoacán region. In Michoacán there are over 45 known archaeological sites although only seven are open to the public, among these are Tzintzuntzan, Ihuatzio and Tingambato, which represent the rich Purépecha culture, although it is known that remains of previous cultures are hidden under the bases of these and other ceremonial centers. The Purépecha people dominated a large territory which includes the States of Michoacán, Guanajuato, Querétaro, part of Jalisco and Guerrero, was an indomitable race that resisted the onslaught of the Aztecs, who could never dominate them, however, and due to their astronomical predictions voluntarily submitted to the Spanish domain, willingly converting to Christianity. Toponymy The Ihuatzio name comes from the Purépecha language word Hihuatsi, that means \\"Coyotes Place\\". From Information in the Relación de Michoacan,Jerónimo de Alcalá, 1542, Relación de Michoacán, Moisés Franco Mendoza (coord.), paleografía Clotilde Martínez Ibáñez y Carmen Molina Ruiz, México, El Colegio de Michoacán, Gobierno del Estado de Michoacán, 2000, p.321. the place is also known by its Nahuatl name as Cuyacan or Cuyuacan (Coyoacan) and it is first mentioned when Tariácuri plans his attack to Tariaran. Lake Patzcuaro Lake Pátzcuaro lies in an endorheic basin, which does not drain to the sea. The Lake Pátzcuaro basin is of volcanic origin. At times it has been part of an open and continuous hydrological system formed by Lake Cuitzeo, Pátzcuaro and Lake Zirahuén, which drained into the Lerma River. Today, like lakes Cuitzeo and Zirahuén, it is a closed basin, although ecologists consider it a sub-basin of the Lerma-Chapala basin.\\"Descripción de la cuenca\\", Recuperación Ambiental del Lago de Pátzcuaro\\". Accessed October 18, 2009. The Lake Pátzcuaro basin is home to the Purépecha people. Purépecha leaders established the basin as the heartland of the Tarascan state, which rivaled the Aztec Empire before the Spanish conquest. The towns of Ihuatzio, Tzintzuntzan and Pátzcuaro were important Tarascan centers. Purépecha language The Purépecha language, is an isolated language, which is not even provisionally related to any other language. Spoken in the State of Michoacán, near Lake Pátzcuaro and the Parícutin volcano. There are two major variants and perhaps 12 minors; the main language stream occurs between the Lake and the volcanic plateau. Speakers easily identify others origin from their speech, and even the village of origin. They are proud to continue speaking their native language, even if they live elsewhere. However, dialectal differences are relatively recent, and speakers consider all variants as part of the same language. Theories about the Purépecha origin vary. Some say that they came from the north with the Aztecs; others claim they came from the south and perhaps related to the QuechuaQuechua is a Native South American language family and dialect cluster spoken primarily in the Andes of South America, derived from an original common ancestor language, Proto-Quechua. It is the most widely spoken language family of the indigenous peoples of the Americas, with a total of probably some 6 to 8 million speakers (estimates vary widely). Some speakers of Quechua also call it 'runa simi' (or regional variants thereof), literally 'people speech', although 'runa' here has the more specific sense of indigenous Andean people. from Ecuador, Bolivia and Peru. While their language is isolated, it shares some features with the Zuni Zuni (also Zuñi) is a language of the Zuni people, indigenous to western New Mexico and eastern Arizona in the United States. It is spoken by around 9,500 people worldwide, especially in the vicinity of Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico, and much smaller numbers in parts of Arizona. and quechua (perhaps not more than borrowed features). Greenberg assigned it to the Chibchan language family, but this proposal was rejected by specialists.Greenberg 1987 Statistical studies by Swadesh have suggested relationships to Zuñi, Quechua, Mayan and Aymara, but these conclusions remain unproven. Tarascan State The Tarascan state was a prehispanic Mesoamerican empire, roughly covering the geographic area of the present-day Mexican state of Michoacán. In Purépecha, language of the Purépecha, the name of the state was Iréchecua Tzintzuntzáni, the \\"lands of Tzintzuntzan\\". The Purépecha were a nomadic group that arrived in the basin of Lake Pátzcuaro. Their place of origin is unknown; however, it is known that their food and livelihood depended on their hunter-gatherer activities. The main events of society tarascan are described in the aforementioned \\"Relacion de Michoacan\\"; this 16th-century document mentions the Tarascan arrival at Zacapú, \\"Naranja de Tapia\\", where they established alliances through the marriage of Ireti- Ticátame (\\"guide and lord\\"), with a local woman. Later, they were forced to leave and headed towards the Patzcuaro Basin. The people of the Tarascan empire were mostly of Purépecha ethnic affiliation but also included other earlier ethnic groups such as the Nahua, Otomi, Matlatzinca and Chichimec. These ethnic groups were gradually assimilated into the Purépecha majority group. The Tarascan state was contemporary with and an enemy of the Aztec Empire, against which it fought many wars. The Tarascan Empire blocked Aztec expansion to the northwest, and the Tarascans fortified and patrolled their frontiers with the Aztecs, possibly developing the first truly territorial state of Mesoamerica. Due to its relative isolation within Mesoamerica, the Tarascan state had many cultural traits completely distinct from those of the Mesoamerican cultural group. It is particularly noteworthy for being among the few Mesoamerican civilizations to use metal for tools and ornamentation. A Tarascan incense burner showing a deity with a \\"Tlaloc headdress\\", 1350–1521 CE. In the late mesoamerican classical period, at least two non Purépecha ethnic groups lived around Lake Pátzcuaro: Nahuatl speakers in Jarácuaro, and some Chichimecan cultures on the northern banks, with the Nahua population being the second largest. First Occupation A number of Nahua-speaking groups arrived to the area during the first stage. They already possessed a rudimentary food-production technology and probably had a sedentary mindset. Abundant food resources and other natural conditions were a determining factor in the formation and sustenance of the area's dense population. By the time of the second stage, the Tarascan group took control of a vast territory, settling in the Pátzcuaro watershed and setting up a tributary system based on their overwhelming military strength. Together with Tzintzuntzan and Pátzcuaro, Ihuatzio figured among the most important Tarascan settlements. According to archaeologist Efraín Cárdenas, from archaeological evidence, the first occupation is tentatively chronologically located at between 900 and 1200 CE, corresponding to Nahuatl speaking groups. Second Occupation During the second period the site is occupied by the Purépecha culture, according to archaeologist Efraín Cárdenas. The second occupation period, chronologically placed at between 1200 and 1530 CE, corresponds to Tarascan domain, of the Lake Pátzcuaro basin and almost all the northern part of the State of Michoacán. It is very difficult to establish the site construction chronology exclusively from archaeological data. The \\"Relación de Michoacán\\" mentions that upon the death of Tariácuri, the most outstanding character of narration, the political and religious power he had was divided into three lordships: Pátzcuaro, Ihuatzio and Tzintzuntzan. These were governed by three major characters: his youngest son Huiquingaje and nephews Hiripan and Tangaxoan. This transcendental event of Tarascan (Purépecha) military and political development was described by Jerónimo de AlcaláJerónimo de Alcalá was born in Murcia, Spain. Whether he was a converted catholic is argued, as it is not proved, although some authors consider it probable. He abandoned his religious vocation and became a doctor in Valencia. He was married twice. testimony as follows: :::\\"... at the break of dawn, before daylight, Tariácuri climbed a mound called Thiapu, he cleared a section and made three dirt piles, he placed atop each a stone and an arrow. His nephews climbed the mound...[where Tariácuri stated:] Children hear me: look Hiripan, there will be three Lords. Yours is this pile which is in the middle, which is the village of Coyoacán [Ihuatzio]: and you Tangaxoán you're on this heap which is the village of Michoacán [Tzintzuntzan]; and you Huiquingaje, you're in this town is the village of Pátzcuaro. \\"Hence, there will be three Lords.\\" This event is very important to understand the growth and development of Ihuatzio, because of the initiative always shown by Hiripan during conquests, power again concentrated, but not in a particular person, but in a certain space: Ihuatzio. Radiocarbon dating place the site between 1510 and 1575 CE. Investigations The first reference of existence of archaeological vestiges in this place goes back to 1799 from a Bravo Ugarte description, who contributed information about the constructive system, mentioning that it reflected a low technological level since lime and sand were not used; nevertheless, he made references to large site dimensions. Later, in 1855 friar Pedro Beaumont, in the Michoacán Chronicle, displays the first map of the Pátzcuaro Lake basin, with indication of the most important Tarascan establishments. Beaumont refers to Ihuatzio as one of the main tarascan establishments of the Pátzcuaro Lake basin. In 1929, Marquina for the first time made a survey of the site surface, describing and making sketches of the rectangular base structures. According to him, Ihuatzio is composed of two main groups: a platform oriented north-south 400 meters long by 300 wide. This platform is delimited by wide walls remains. On its center there are 3 yácatasYácatas are structures of mixed plant, with a semi-circular section built over pyramids, in Tarascan language Yácata means a \\"pile of stones\\" facing east. To the north of this platform is another one of smaller dimensions (300 by 180 meters) oriented east-west, also limited on its larger sides by tall staggered walls 10 meters wide that form a 223 by 147 meters plaza. This plaza has two rectangular structures, also facing east, seated on a common 87 by 37.5 meters platform. Between 1937 and 1938, Caso and Acosta performed excavations, release and consolidation works of the base rectangular structures took place. During these works the Chacmool was found, a ritual element that denotes a cultural contact with Toltec sites such as Tula where this archaeological element constitutes a distinguishing characteristic. The site was opened to the public in 1937–1938, although a visitor's register only started in 1994. History Historically speaking, Ihuatzio is mentioned as one of the three heads of the Purépecha or Tarascan Empire at the time when the group consolidated. The activities performed by the Tarascan or P’urépechas at this site, were related to the economic and social organization of the different sectors of the prehispanic society and to activities of ritual and ceremonial character. This is deduced from archaeological findings, as well as written data available from sources during the Spanish conquest. These sources are; the Michoacán Chronicle, the Jucutacato canvas and the ceremonies and rites relation of population and government of the Indians of the province of Michoacán (simply known as Relation of Michoacán). As noted, Tariácuri explained to his nephews how they will attack the town of Hiuacha (Tariaran), and how Hiripan will become king of Cuyacan, Tangaxoan of Mechuacan (Tzintzuntzan) and his son Hiquingaje in Pátzcuaro. By then Hiripan, Tangaxoan and Hiquingaje had been living for some time in Tzintzuntzan. Hiripan spied on his enemies from the Tariacaherio hill, north of Ihuatzio, and there CuricaueriCuricaueri (purépecha language: great fire or large bonfire), is the name of the God of fire in Purépecha or Tarascan culture, which was established in the current Mexican State of Michoacán during the postclassical period Mesoamerican. appeared before him on a dream and warned him that he will be king. When the Chichimeca attacked the Pacandan IslePacanda comes from the purépecha and means \\"to push something in the water\\", has a privileged location in the central part of Lake Pátzcuaro, its inhabitants are native peoples which preserved customs and ancient traditions. La Pacanda people to obtain the first captives to be sacrificed in the Querétaro temple, Tariácuri orders his nephews to go to harata Hiuazi and Yuazi xanchacuyo from where they will attack the islanders, while working in farming lands near the shore of the lake (in a place called Araueni). It is possible that both sites were in or near what later would be Ihuatzio. When Tariácuri dies, Hiripan follows his uncle orders, three kingdoms are formed and he constructed a house in Cuyacan. Later, when they begin to organize the territory that has been conquered, they decide to construct in Cuyacan a house for the God Curicaueri and to keep treasures obtained in the conquests there. From then on Cuyacan becomes the head of the kingdom. Hiripan was buried in Cuyacan and his son Ticatame succeeded him. During his reign, the head of the kingdom was transferred to Tzintzuntzan to where Zizispandaquare (son of Tangaxoan) moved Curicaueri together with the treasure. In spite of having lost their position, Cuyacan continued being an important site. When they went to war, the Cuyacan lord was the one who harangued the soldiers and when they chose a new cazonci,Cazonci or caltzontzin or irecha, is the term used in the Purépecha or Tarascan culture, for their rulers. The Cazonci exerted maximum economic, legal and religious authority, its position was privileged because it was regarded as representative of the gods. The cazonci regularly inherited his position to his descendants in direct line, or very close relatives. he was one of the members of the group that met to discuss who would be the next king. In fact, Zinzicha considered Paquingata, lord of Cuyacan as a possible Cazonci, but he refused. Paquingata was grandson of Ticatame and son of Tucuruan. The site Architecturally speaking, Ihuatzio is one of the most extensive and complex sites of the State of Michoacán. The archaeological remains are distributed in an approximate area of 50 hectares. Unfortunately, as in most Mexican archaeological sites, not every area of monuments has been explored and therefore are only partially open to the public; the only sector that can be visited is known as \\"Plaza de Armas\\", where rectangular base pyramidal structures are located, placed on an also rectangular platform. The prehispanic settlement fully covers a low-lying plateau and keeps a strategic location at the extreme west of the Lake and other dominant sites as Tzintzuntzan. It is possible that Ihuatzio controlled this portion of the basin. This site contains the best preserved monuments of the Michoacán Kingdom civilization depicting its greatness: a pyramid which served the natives as the main square; remains of a tower or fortress that was built (according to an ancient tradition) by the founder of the city in prehispanic times; some yácatas or kings tombs which have, where idols, decorations, weapons and vessels were uncovered; a well-constructed street or road, called Querendaro that served to communicate with Tzintzuntzan to the north. Structures The characteristic features of the Ihuatzio archaeological site are defensive-walls and walled roads. The first constitute a communication system between the main groups of constructions and access points to the site at prehispanic times. The second element, the roads, constitutes an interior road system, only that their functions could be diverse, as serving as a defense wall and limiting accesses to the site as well as internal communication. =Plaza de Armas= The Plaza de Armas is a huge rectangular, graded area bordered on the north and south ends by structures called wall-causeways which were used as roads. Ceremonial activities, rituals, and festivities were celebrated in the different parts of this square. Yet there is the possibility that some economic activities, such as marketing and exchange of goods, were also carried out here. It is even believed that it was sometimes used as a ball court playing field, as well. The area open to the public, consists of a large quadrangular space bordered by two elements called \\"uatziris\\" (or Huatziris) by local people. These elements are wide staggered walls in both sides; access to the top side was by an embedded stairway. At the western end of the plaza a rectangular platform was placed on which two plinths were constructed; these are described next. =Yácatas= Three Yácatas are located on a large plaza, south of the \\"Plaza de Armas\\", which is not yet open to the public. These buildings, whose foundation combines a rectangle with a semicircle, are characteristic of some purépecha sites of the 15th and 16th centuries. It had a stairway embedded in the center of the rectangular body. These three yácatas face west, on the semicircular part of their bodies, precisely in front of one of the mentioned wall-roads and constitute the communication system between the main building groups and the access points to the site at prehispanic times. The Yácatas walls are built with horizontally set slabs which cover a rock and earth core. The outer coating consisted of Janamus blocksJanamu or Xanamu are red volcanic rock blocks, in Purépecha or tarascan language Xanamu means rough stone which once fully covered the structures but have since weathered completely. Some vestiges can be seen on the east face of rectangular structure no. 1. =Huatziri= The Huatziris or walled causeway (Muro-Calzada), is a most infrequent element in western Mexico's archaeology. It consists of a structure built with a system similar to that used in the rectangular buildings, namely, a rock and earth core covered by stone slabs. It displays a stuccoed-upper part, stepped tiers, and an average height of seven feet. It surrounds a large part of the settlement and had the dual function of road and entrance control. The top of the wall was also finished and has staggered bodies, but it is smaller than the \\"Calzada del Rey\\" walls, described below, it measures 2.5 meters high average; this wall surrounds a large part of the settlement and had a double function, it served for roadway and also as a defensive element. =Platform= It is of rectangular base, constructed with a dirt and stone nucleus, covered with stone slabs without cement. Finishing was with stone xanamu carved blocks, of which only some samples are left. It measures 87 meters long; 37.5 wide and 1.5 high. The following structures were built on top. =Pyramidal Foundations= These are two structures laid out east-west with stairways facing east. The construction consisted of a basalt stone nucleus, covered with stone slabs staggered walls, making up 11 bodies, finishing also consisted of Xanamu slabs. There are only remains of the stairways. Between these two structures there is a 1.65 meters wide passageway, where excavations unearthed human skeletons and the Chac-Mool sculpture. =Calzada del Rey= The \\"King Road\\" is a characteristic feature of this site, unique in prehispanic architecture not only of Michoacán but also of Western Mexico, are enormous constructions of approximately 250 meters long by 20 wide and more than 5 meters high, which are conformed by several overlaid bodies and located in the west and south sectors of the site. There is a flattened dirt floor on top, and are delimited by two small protective walls for pedestrian use. From their shape and displayed distribution in the landscape and because of the spaces that are communicated, it is assumed that they served as walkways used to transport the \\"Cazonzi\\" (purépecha or tarascan name for the king) from the ceremonial center to different points of the site. =Mirador= The south sector has another unique element, it consists of a circular base construction, cylinder shaped. This building, exclusive of the Ihuatzio archaeological site, does not display a well-defined access point and its precise function is not known. Nevertheless, given its strategic location, it is supposed it served as a cosmos observatory or viewpoint. The only certain fact is that there are no other similar structures in all of Michoacán, or registered sites in Guanajuato and Jalisco states.

It tells the story of an old artist who saves the life of a young neighboring artist, dying of pneumonia, by giving her the will to live. Through her window she can see an old vine (growing on a nearby wall), gradually shedding its leaves as autumn turns into winter, and she has taken the thought into her head that she will die when the last leaf falls. The leaves fall day by day, but the last lone leaf stays on for several days. The ill woman's health quickly recovers. At the story's end, we learn that the old artist, who always wanted to produce a masterpiece painting but had never had any success, spent considerable time painting with great realism a leaf on the wall for the whole night. Furthermore, the old artist himself dies of pneumonia contracted while being out in the wet and cold.

Early life Hymie Barsel was born on 11 September 1920 in Fordsburg, Johannesburg, South Africa to Faiga and Moishe Barsel, both of Litvak heritage. He was raised in a Zionist oriented home. He suffered from epilepsy which was ill understood at that time, eventually receiving treatment from Dr. Max Joffe; also a Zionist. Dr. Joffe taught him that antisemitism could never be destroyed unless all racial prejudice was similarly destroyed, this concept of equality of all humanity was at that time the basis of the understanding of the term Communist – a philosophy of human upliftment followed by many in the liberation movement. This was very different from the version of Communism that would later follow in the Soviet Union. Political involvement Hymie became progressively more involved in the Youth Liberation Movement and began working as an organizer and then Secretary of the Friends of the Soviet Union (FSU). He was sent to Durban where he worked with the African National Congress (ANC) and the Natal Indian Congress (NIC); this is where he was confronted by the violence offered by the Grey Shirts (a Fascist organization). Hymie organized FSU branches throughout South Africa, and organized medical assistance for the Soviet Union during the war. He was appointed Secretary of the Johannesburg Medical Aid for Russia. During the war, South Africa and the Soviet Union were allies, and Hymie sought diplomatic ties between South Africa and Russia. Russia opened a diplomatic mission in South Africa, but this was not reciprocated by South Africa in Russia. Family and politics After the war, Hymie married Esther Levin on 4 December 1945, another Litvak who had been born in Raguva, Lithuania. Together Hymie and Esther worked to organize the Congress of the People (COP) in June 1955. Hymie was famous for selling and distributing COP literature. Hymie and Esther lent their energies to the organization of the Women’s March in Pretoria on 9 August 1956 where 20,000 women marched and submitted petitions protesting the \\"Pass Laws\\", a fundamental building block of Apartheid. This organization that was partly led and created by the Barsels is now accorded a National Holiday in the new South Africa. Hymie was charged with treason and arrested on 13 December 1956. His co-accused included Nelson Mandela and other political luminaries. Esther was left behind to care for the three children – Sonya, then 8 years old, Linda, then 5, and the baby – Merle, aged 8 months. Eventually the South African Government withdrew charges against Hymie on 20 April 1959 after having subjected him to torture, solitary confinement and other pernicious forms of severe punishments. Hymie was then subjected to a banning order in March 1964. Both he and his wife Esther were then arrested on 3 July 1964 and charged in the Bram Fischer Trial. Esther was sentenced to three years hard labor, with a banning order upon her release from Women’s Prison, while Hymie was acquitted. He was placed under house arrest with his daughters from 1965 to 1968. On 7 April 1968, Esther was released from hard labor, but subject to a banning order. Both were subjected to ongoing harassment. When their eldest daughter Sonya was married, Esther and Hymie were required by the South African Security Police to provide the guest list, or not be allowed to attend their daughter’s wedding. They refused to comply, notwithstanding that all their friends were either in prison, banned or in hiding. Only days before the wedding did the police relent and allow them to attend Sonya’s wedding. Esther and Hymie were not allowed to attend religious services or meet with friends. When Hymie’s mother, Feiga died, Esther was not allowed to attend her funeral. The three daughters have spoken about how difficult it was growing up with parents who were avowed Communists. South Africa was a police state of draconian laws with a free rein given to the Department of Justice, the Police and the South African Bureau of State Security (B.O.S.S.), whose closest equivalent was the KGB. The tactics used by BOSS, especially during frequent States of Emergency, were closer to the fascistic brutality reported by survivors of death camps and gulags than accepted strategies employed by the civilized world. Almost all of their relatives stayed away from the girls, not because they were cruel or unkind but because the power of the Government was absolute and guilt-by-association was common. The notable exception was one unit of Hymie's family: his mother, Faiga, his sister, Chana [Anne] and her husband, Yudel (Jules) Price. More than once the little girls were dropped off in the middle of the night when it became necessary for Hymie and Esther to go into hiding. Without this family's love, it's hard to imagine what would have happened to Sonya, Linda and Merle. It was in the warm cocoon of the Price household that they learned the Yiddishkeit that has sustained them in adulthood. Sonya (Sunny) tells stories of how she was shunned by her friends. Most of their parents were too afraid to let their children near this tainted family and life was lonely for much of her young life. Her boyfriend, Clive Lubner, came from a prominent family and he was told he needed to break off contact with Sunny. He defiantly told his beloved father that not only would he not comply, but that he intended to marry her. Which he did and 43 years later they are still married. Both Hymie and Esther were required to report to the Police weekly. On one such report, Hymie was made to sign a \\"Parole Book\\" instead of the \\"Banning Order Book\\", both located in the same place. He was then re-charged by the police for signing the wrong book, an action he was forced to take. Death Hymie died on 13 March 1987 of heart and kidney failure. His heart had been weakened by the torture he had been subjected to whilst fighting for the equality of his African brethren. He was buried in Johannesburg in a traditional Jewish funeral. He is featured on a postage stamp issued jointly by Liberia, Gambia and Sierra Leone that notes him as one of the Legendary Heroes of Africa.

It is located in the département of Hautes-Alpes.  Geography  Of all the great glaciers in the Oisans region, the Glacier Noir is the one that descends furthest into the valley. This is thanks to favourable topography and the fact that the lower tongue of the glacier is entirely covered with ablation moraine. As a result, it is better screened from direct sunshine than, for example, its neighbour, the Glacier Blanc (\\"white glacier\\"). Until at least 1866 the Glacier Noir and Glacier Blanc were combined into a single glacial systemAccording to other sources the separation of the Glacier Blanc and the Glacier Noir occurred in 1876, c.f. above the Pré de Madame Carle. But whilst the foot of the Glacier Blanc has retreated today to a height of around , the snout of the Glacier Noir descends a further 200 metres in height to about .Vgl. Description at vallouimages.com. A glacier covered in moraine debris is generally referred to in French as a glacier noir.See The Glacier Noir with Pic Coolidge and the Barre des Écrins The Glacier Noir is fed from two high-altitude firn basins. The northern branch (branche septentrionale) is in turn fed from the bowl below the Col des Avalanches, at the foot of Pic Coolidge and the Barre des Écrins, the southwesternmost four-thousander of the Alps. From here it flows below the south face of the Crête de l'Encoula (also: Crête de l'Encula), a crest that runs from the Barre to the Pointe du Serre Subeyran. The great majority of the rubble that covers the lower section of the glacier is transported from its northern branch. The Ailefroide () above the southern glacier branch The southern branch (branche méridionale) originates between the faces of the Ailefroide and Pic Coolidge, below the Col de Coste Rouge () and the Col de la Temple (). The steep north faces of the Ailefroide, Pic du Coup de Sabre and Pic Sans Nom tower 1,000 to 1,500 metres above the glacier. The arête, which runs over these peaks eastwards to Mont Pelvoux, is also called the Grand Muraille du Glacier Noir. Five summits along this crest (Ailefroide Central, Pointe Fourastier, Pic Sans Nom, Pointe Puiseux and Pointe Durand) exceed the 3,900 metre mark. On its left-hand side, the southern branch of the glacier is bounded by the eastern foothills of Pic Coolidge. Hemmed in between these two faces, the firn stream flows initially northeastwards before swinging north just before the two ice streams merge. Rubble first appears on the surface of the southern glacial branch in large quantities in its lower reaches. The two ice streams of the Glacier Noir merge at a height of over . However, the southern arm is about to retreat over the boundary between the lower basin and upper bowl, which will separate the glacier into distinct lower and upper sections.Information and photos about the breakup of the glacier at vallouise.info Currently the combined tongue of ice flows from its junction, descending another good 200 metres in height, and ends beneath the northern foothills of Mont Pelvoux. It is about 400 metres wide at this point and a high and steep lateral moraine towers over it on the left-hand (northern) side, across which a climbing path runs from the Pré de Madame Carle, above the village of Ailefroide. Measurements are more difficult than on other glaciers as a result of the covering of moraine. In 1965 the glacier was about 5.5 km long from head to snout and had an area of just under 6 km². Due to its covering of moraine, variations in these dimensions are less than those of other glaciers of similar size that are not so covered. The meltwaters of the Glacier Noir pass down the Torrent du Glacier Noir, the Gyr, the Gyronde, the Durance and finally the Rhône into the Mediterranean Sea.  Access  On the Glacier Noir, with the Montagne des Agneaux (background) The glacier may be easily reached on foot from the hut of Refuge Cézanne at the Pré de Madame Carle, where the road from the climber's village of Ailefroide ends in the Vallouise at a large car park. Initially following the path to the Refuge du Glacier Blanc, it bears left where the paths fork and reaches the lateral moraine of the glacier on which there is a route high above the glacier on that side.Walk 6013 - Pré de Madame Carle - Glacier Noir, Ecrins NP at www.walkingeurope.info. Accessed on 19 Dec 2010. From La Bérarde, another alpinist centre in the Écrins Massif, the Col de la Temple offers a high, but comparatively easy crossing into the Vallouise for experienced glacier walkers. The climbing path runs over the southern branch of the Glacier Noir and then makes for the junction of both glacial arms before crossing the northern branch to the lateral moraine on the opposite side. The Refuge Temple-Écrins in the Haut Vénéon may be used as a base.Via Glacier Noir at www.summitpost.org. Accessed on 19 Dec 2010.  Historic development  As already mentioned, the Glacier Noir and Glacier Blanc used to form a single glacial system. During the Small Ice Age the combined ice mass reached its maximum extent in 1815 and ended roughly at the height of the present-day Cézanne Hut ().Website of Kommune Pelvoux in the Vallouise About a kilometre further down the valley is the old terminal moraine of Fontfroide, relic of an advance of the Glacier Noir and Glacier Blanc from the time before the 16th century. After the retreat of the glacier, vegetation gradually returned on the flat river meadows and created the majestic landscape of the Pré de Madame Carle.

Biography  Peter was born in 1922 in Ithaca, New York. His father was an Armenian immigrant, who had a farm near the town and worked in a quarry that was the source of the stone used to construct Myron Taylor Hall. Peter graduated from Ithaca High School in 1940 and then enlisted in the United States Army Air Corps. In 1947 Peter gave up a job which paid $4,400 annually for a post as an electriconics technician at Cornell that paid only $2,200. In 1960, he moved to Arecibo, Puerto Rico to help build the world's largest radio telescope. He returned to New York State two years later to lead the Research and Development Laboratory of the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center, and lived in Aurora, New York. His work involved specialized, low-noise radio astronomy receiver and antenna systems. In the aftermath of the black student takeover of Willard Straight Hall, Cornell revamped its governance, including adding student and faculty representatives to its board of trustees and creating a student-faculty- employee University Senate. Peter won election to the first Senate in 1970 and immediately began lobbying to establish an employee trustee position. When the state legislature created that seat in 1975, Peter won election to the position and served five terms. Peter also served as an employee representative on the Senate's Executive Committee and chaired other committees. He also served on the Trustee Executive Committee. He also started a page devoted to employee concerns in the Cornell Chronicle as well as other Cornell employee publications. Peter wrote a column called \\"Leadership Leads\\" and a collection of his columns was subsequently published as a book. Peter served as employee representative on two Presidential search committees. Outside his Cornell employment, Peter owned a TV and appliance sales and service business from 1952 to 1960 and from 1962 to 1968. Peter was active as a Freemason and gained rapport with other trustees who were also masons. Peter served as Master of two local lodges as well as Grand Historian for the Grand Lodge of the State of New York. He co-founded a series of leadership courses for New York masons. After Peter retired from Cornell in 1988, Peter was active in the Cornell Retirees Association. Cornell elected Peter trustee emeritus in 1990. Peter then became active in the Morgan Opera House in Aurora, New York. He was co-founder of the Cornell Recreation Club.

It has subsidiaries in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, China, Romania and Sri Lanka. In 2018, the Sonaca Group's operating revenues amounted to $900 million. The Sonaca Group consists of 4,630 workers. 92.604% of the company is owned by SRIW S.A. (French: Société Régionale d'Investissement de Wallonie), 7.393% is owned by SFPI S.A. (French: Société Fédérale de Participations et d'Investissement) and 0.003% is owned by SABCA S.A. The primary activities of the Sonaca Group are the design and construction of the mobile parts of wings (slats and flaps), as well as complex structural parts for civil and military aircraft. In addition, the Sonaca Group has continuously developed, designed and constructed activities in space structures. History SEGA Sonaca is the heir to the Belgian company Avions Fairey, but before that to SEGA (French: Société Générale d'Entreprises Aéronautiques). SEGA was created on 25 June 1920 before the notary Maillard by a group of local notables: Fernand Loescher, Victor Dupuis, Alphonse and Désiré Jaumin, André Gobbe, Marius Loiselet and Arille Carlier. The first activity developed by SEGA was the flying school launched by Commander Fernand Jacquet, a 7-victory WWI-ace and a leading figure in military aviation, a position from which he resigned in January 1921. In July 1921, Jacquet obtained a major contract for the training of military pilots, which for nearly ten years was the primary activity of SEGA. The company gradually acquired all the land that constituted the embryo of what is now the Gosselies aerodrome. In the 1920s, SEGA carried out repairs, produced under license 5 AVIA BH-21, and even prototypes of the HB-1 based on plans by Henri Bulté. Avions Fairey In 1931, when Belgium bought 43 Fairey Firefly IIM, the contract stipulated that part of the equipment (33) had to be manufactured in Belgium. Faced with SABCA's refusal to produce these licensed aircraft, Fairey UK (Hayes) decided to create a subsidiary under the direction of Ernest-Oscar Tips, Société Belge des Avions Fairey, using SEGA's aerodrome, facilities and qualified staff. During the first 8 years of activity, the company produced 250 aircraft.https://www.rtbf.be/info/economie/detail_la- sonaca-leader-de-la-construction-aeronautique-celebre-ses-80-ans?id=6769533 Then, Avions Fairey produced Fairey Fox, a light bomber derived from the Firefly. The Tipsy range of light aircraft is developed and built at Fairey factories under the impetus of Ernest O.Tips. Another development of Fairey factories is the \\"Phantom\\", an improved version of the Firefly. This biplane was known for its elegant lines but technologically outdated. It was not commercially successful. In order to urgently rearm military aeronautics at the dawn of the Second World War, in parallel with the order for the British- made Hawker Hurricane Mk1, an order for 80 aircraft to be manufactured in Belgium was placed. Only two planes could still be delivered before the conflict broke out. At dawn on May 10, 1940, the factory was seriously damaged by a German bombardment.https://www.rtbf.be/info/economie/detail_la-sonaca- leader-de-la-construction-aeronautique-celebre-ses-80-ans?id=6769533 SEGA was inactive until 1946, when the maintenance activity of the Belgian Air Force aircraft and some civil aviation administration aircraft resumed. From 1950 onwards, the factory began to produce the Meteor F8 for the Belgian and Dutch air forces. From 1953 to 1958, it then produced the fuselages of the Hawker Hunters of the same air forces. In 1957, it manufactured the Tipsy Nipper, a cheap single-engine single-seater equipped with a 25 HP VW motor. From 1957 to 1963, SEGA carried out the maintenance of the Belgian Air Force's F-84F. When six European countries chose to acquire F-104G combat planes, \\"Avions Fairey\\" and SABCA joined forces to produce them. The Belgian F-104G were produced between January 1962 and June 1965. Between 1964 and 1971, \\"Avions Fairey\\" also carried out some maintenance work on the Luftwaffe's F-104G aircraft. From May 1960, on the basis of instructions from the British government to rationalise its aeronautical industry, Fairey UK had completely divested itself of the sector by selling its own aeronautical activities to Westland. In 1968, SEGA was incorporated into the capital of Fairey S.A. In 1972, the English company \\"Fairey Aviation\\" bought Britten-Norman, which was virtually bankrupt despite its interesting twin-engine BN-2 Islander utility plane. The idea was to boost sales and production at the Gosselies plant, which was sorely lacking in a work plan. Initially, the Islander was manufactured in Romania and completed in Gosselies, where they then produced entirely, including the Trislander development. The Belgian army acquired 12 Islanders in 1976. Sonaca The UK subsidiary had financial difficulties, which led to its liquidation on 11 October 1977 and which spread to its Belgian subsidiary. However, Belgium had chosen the F-16 as its multi-role aircraft, and its industry was already well-engaged in a multinational partnership (Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Norway) for the production of the F-16 in Europe. The Belgian government decides to buy the company to ensure the sustainability of its participation in this contract.https://www.rtbf.be/info/economie/detail_la-sonaca-leader-de-la- construction-aeronautique-celebre-ses-80-ans?id=6769533 Thus, Avions Fairey, whose activity had never been interrupted after its request for a composition on 30 September 1977, officially took over under the name of Sonaca - an acronym for “Société Nationale de Construction Aérospatiale” - as from 1 June 1978. In this major contract, Sonaca manufactured the rear fuselage and assembled the F16.https://www.rtbf.be/info/economie/detail_la-sonaca-leader- de-la-construction-aeronautique-celebre-ses-80-ans?id=6769533 Sonaca Group From the 2000s onward, Sonaca has begun its expansion as Sonaca Group. In the 2000s, Sonaca opened a subsidiary near Embraer in Brazil called Sobraer. It is located in São José dos Campos and mainly manufactures fuselage parts. Since 2004, two more factories have been involved in supplying small aircraft parts, PESOLA and SOPECAERO. All Brazilian subsidiaries are currently in the process of merging into Sonaca Brasil. In 2007, Sonaca's Canadian subsidiary received support from the Government of Montreal to invest $17 million in the expansion of its aircraft wing manufacturing and assembly plant.https://www.economie.gouv.qc.ca/ministere/salle-de-presse/communiques- de-presse/communique-de- presse/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=4125&cHash;=85581c5355e1074a0d9e36f31711c76c In December 2017, Sonaca's Canadian subsidiary acquired a giant CNC machine for $7.5 million to manufacture giant parts at very high speeds.https://www.journaldemontreal.com/2017/12/12/aeronautique-sonaca- investit-a-mirabel In 2010, Sonaca acquired a subsidiary in China, Sinelson. Later, in 2016, it will obtain another Romania, Sonaca Transilvania. On September 16, 2015, Sonaca created a new subsidiary, Sonaca Aircraft, to develop a new two-seater training and leisure aircraft.https://www.sonaca.com/wp- content/uploads/2018/05/annual_report_2015.pdf On June 19, 2017, Sonaca made the first test flight of the Sonaca 200, a prototype two-seater training aircraft scheduled to go into production in the fall.

It is located about two miles west of Lafayette near Oregon Route 99W. The area is sometimes known as \\"St. Joe\\". Early history Saint Joseph was named by Ben Holladay, who chose this location as the terminus of the westside line of his Oregon Central Railroad, in order to encourage competition between Lafayette and McMinnville. He probably named the station after Saint Joseph, Missouri, although another source says it was named to honor Holladay's brother Joseph. Saint Joseph post office operated from 1872 until 1878. Holladay had planned to extend the railway south of Saint Joseph down the Willamette Valley, but he ran out of money. Turntables were used to return the train to Portland. Saint Joseph was platted with 74 blocks that each contained ten lots, and at one time the town had 150 houses. There was a two-story hotel, and stagecoaches from McMinnville, Dayton, and Lafayette would meet the train, which brought passengers from the East Coast looking to buy acreage in the area from two companies that were formed to sell land there in about 1900. Henry Villard extended the railroad line from Saint Joseph south to Corvallis in 1878, and McMinnville became the more important railroad terminal. Railroads Later, the eastside and westside lines of the Southern Pacific's Red Electric interurban train met in Saint Joseph, Southern Pacific having gained control of the former Oregon Central tracks in 1887. The westside line ran on the original Oregon Central tracks, while the eastside line ran on a connection that was extended from Saint Joseph to Lafayette in 1906, forming a wye that allowed trains to travel in three directions: north to Carlton and Forest Grove, northeast through Lafayette to Newberg, or southwest to McMinnville and eventually Corvallis. The Red Electric began service in 1914 was discontinued in 1929, at which time the lines began to be used for freight service. By the late 1970s, Southern Pacific (SP) was rarely using the westside line, now known as the St. Joseph Branch, from Saint Joseph north to Seghers, because traffic was mostly serving the Stimson Lumber Company sawmill and a few grain silos in and around Carlton. By 1980, SP was only storing cars on the line south of the junction to the sawmill, and by 1985, it had abandoned and torn up a long section of track from the mill junction to just north of Carlton. The tracks north out of Saint Joseph extended almost five miles and ended about a mile north of Carlton in order to serve the remaining Carlton customers. By the early 1990s, the line was cut back to about 1.5 miles and today, this portion is used by the Portland and Western Railroad (PNWR) exclusively to store cars. The Southern Pacific lines were leased by the Portland and Western in the early 1990s and PNWR continues to run trains from Newberg through Saint Joseph to Corvallis. Great Depression During President Franklin Roosevelt's administration, a Works Progress Administration (WPA) project had the federal government buying acreage in the Saint Joseph area for resettlement purposes. Most of the 1,500 acres was divided into small dairy farms on which WPA workers built houses, garages, and barns. The land sold for $100 an acre. Today Despite the various attempts at promoting Saint Joseph's economy, little remains of the community, and it is considered a ghost town.

Château d'Ainay- le-Vieil is situated at an elevation of 168 meters. After having bought the castle from Jacques Cœur, Charles de Bigny built a pre-Renaissance Louis XII style chateaux from 1500 to 1505. The castle has been listed as a Monument historique since 1968 by the French Ministry of Culture. The castle, now part of Jacques Cœur's tourist route, has been nicknamed \\"the little Carcassonne\\" () because of its circular shape. Today the castle is one of the best preserved fortresses of the 14th century. Location The castle is built on a site located on the frontier of the Frankish kingdom and that of Aquitaine (and later the lands of the French and English kingdoms) that has been fortified since the High Middle Ages and was once occupied by the Gallo- Romans. This location was thus strategically important, especially during the Hundred Years' War, and this can be attested to by its sizeable walls. Because of its importance to the French Kings, it was entrusted to houses close to the King, such as the Bourbons, Barres, Sully, and Culants. The castle property is mentioned in a cartulary in Champagne at the end of the 11th century, naming a member of the House of Bourbon (rulers of Bourbonnais) and a brother of Charles Martel. It then passed into the ownership of Pierre Barres and his brother, Guillaume, who won fame for their family by saving the French king at the Battle of Bouvines in 1214. Next, the Sully family, of the Loire Valley, came into possession of the castle for over a century in a period wherein the castle became an important base from which to harass the English during the Hundred Years' War. After the French defeat at Poitiers in 1356, it became the only castle in the region to remain in French hands. Similarly, it lost all military importance with the French victory at the end of the Hundred Years' War. History Since 1467, the castle has been owned by the family of Jean- Baptiste Colbert, minister to the King, and it passed through the women of the family three generations in. Architecture Château d'Ainay-le-Vieil comprises two distinct parts: one medieval, and one pre-Renaissance in the Louis XII style.

The Bjälbo runestones are three Viking Age memorial runestones, one of which has been lost, located at Bjälbo, which is a village in Mjölby Municipality, Östergötland, Sweden. One of the inscriptions provides evidence of the existence of guilds in Sweden during this period. Ög 64 Runestone Ög 64. A 1907 photograph showing Ög 64 in the church wall. Östergötland Runic Inscription 64 or Ög 64 is the Rundata designation for a granite runestone that is 3.2 meters in height and which was originally found in the wall of the Bjälbo church. Before the historic significance of runestones was understood, they were often re-used as materials in the construction of roads, bridges, and buildings such as churches. The stone was removed from the wall, repaired, and raised in the churchyard in 1935 along with Ög 66. The inscription consists of runic text in the younger futhark that curves once to make two lines. The inscription is classified as being carved in runestone style RAK, which is the classification for runic text bands that have straight ends without any attached serpent or beast heads. There is nothing in the text or design of the inscription that identifies it as being a Christian memorial. p. 12. The inscription is signed by a runemaster named Lófi. No other surviving runestones have his signature. The runic text states that the stone was raised as a memorial to a man named Greipr by members of a Viking Age guild, who do not name themselves individually unless the runemaster Lofi was also a member of the guild. Ög 64 is one of four runestones that mention guilds in Viking Age Sweden, the others being U 379 in Kyrkogården, U 391 in Prästgatan, and Ög MÖLM1960;230 in Törnevalla. p. 179. These stones and others discussing félags are evidence of the trading activities during this period of Scandinavian history. The guild- members refer to themselves as drængiaʀ, translated as \\"valiant men.\\" Drengr is normally a title associated with warriors, but on the runestone Ög MÖLM1960;230 it was used as the name of another guild-member, suggesting that the term drengr was also used among merchants.

Ög 66 Runestone Ög 66. Östergötland Runic Inscription 66 or Ög 66 is the Rundata catalog number for a granite runestone that is 4 meters in height. The stone had been part of the Bjälbo church, and was moved into the churchyard in 1935. The inscription consists of text in the younger futhark carved in a serpent whose head and tail make a knot at the bottom of the stone. Above the serpent is a cross, identifying the memorial as Christian. The inscription is classified as being carved in runestone style Fp, which is the classification for text bands with attached serpent or beast heads depicted as seen from above. The runic text states that the stone was raised by Ingivaldr as a memorial to his brother Styfjaldr, who was the son of Spjallboði. Because one rule followed in craving runes in stone was that two consecutive identical letters were represented by a single rune, even when the two identical letters are at the end of one word and the start of a second word, and word divider punctuation marks were not always used consistently, Rundata recognizes two possible transliterations of the runic text as being valid. The first, designated as \\"P\\" below, recognizes possible double letters and spaces and transcribes the runes from the end of the text as : i it : in ik : anti, meaning i ætt, en ek ændi (\\"and I ended (it)\\"). The other recognized version, which is designated as \\"Q,\\" is based upon a review published in 2007 that transliterates the runes as : it : inik : ant, meaning hæit inni'k ænt (\\"I proclaim the promise fulfilled\\").

Kokomo Arnold song Lyrical themes The lyrics of the Kokomo Arnold record combine the threads of: * Blues on awakening – :Good morning, Blues Blues how do you do? :Do mighty well this morning, can't get along with you. *The loss of a dairy cow – :Says, I woke up this a-morning and I looked outdoors :Says, I knowed my mamlish milk cow pretty mama, Lord, by the way she lowed :Lord, if you see my milk cow, buddy, I said, please drive her home :Says, I ain't had no milk and butter, mama, Lord, since a-my cow been gone * A breakup with his lover – :How can I do right, baby when you won't do right yourself? :Lord, if my good gal quits me well, I don't want nobody else *A warning that she will have regrets – :Now you can read out your hymnbook, preach out your Bible :Fall down on your knees and pray, the good Lord to help you :Because you going to need you going to need my help some day :Mama if you can't quit your sinning please quit your lowdown ways. These four themes are found in the lyrics of later versions of the song. The metaphor of a milk cow for a female lover was already established in recordings with the same title (see below). It is also found in \\"Mean Tight Mama\\" by Sarah Martin in 1928: :Now my hair is nappy and I don’t wear no clothes of silk :But the cow that’s black and ugly has often got the sweetest milk and in \\"My Black Mama Part 1\\" by Son House in 1930, also in a four-line verse, but one formed by repetition: :Well, you see my milk cow tell her to hurry home :I ain’t had no milk since that cow been gone :If you see my milk cow tell her to hurry home :Yeah, I ain’t had no milk since that cow been gone Melody Arnold uses basically two melodic structures, according to the number of lines in a verse. For three-line verses such as the following, he sings a melody interspersed by guitar in the first two lines: :All in good morning, I said, “Blues, how do you do?” :All in good morning, I said, “Blues, how do you do?” :You’re mighty rare this mornin’, can’t get along with you. For four line verses such as the following, he sings the first two lines to a melody uninterrupted by guitar: :Takes a rockin’ chair to rock, mommy, a rubber ball to roll, :Takes a tall cheesin’ black, pretty mommy, to pacify my soul. :Lord, I don’t feel welcome, please, no place I go, :Oh that woman that I love, mommy, have done drove me from her door. In the section described by Elijah Wald as a 'bridge\\", he modifies this four-line melody, most notable with falsetto leaps on the words \\"need\\" and \\"please\\": :Now you can read out your hymnbook, preach out your Bible, :Fall on your knees and pray, the good Lord will help you. :Cause you gonna need, gonna need my help someday. :Mama, if you can’t quit your sinnin’, please quit your lowdown ways. These three melodies, and the device of a falsetto leap were used if following versions of the song. Other songs with the same title The earliest documented recording of a song titled \\"Milk Cow Blues\\" was by Freddie Spruell in 1926. The lyrics are largely on the lost dairy cow theme: :She's a full-blood Jersey, I'm going to tell you boys the way I know :People just screamin' for my milk cow, I don't care where my Jersey go with one hint at a lost lover: :Say my bed is lonesome my pillow now it sure won't do :I wake up out of the midnight I really have those milk cow blues A different song was recorded by Sleepy John Estes in 1930. The lyrics make no mention of a cow, and the relationship with a lover are not hostile but encouraging: :Well, she looked at me, she began to smile :Says, I thought I would use you for my man a while :That's if you just don't let my husband catch you there :Now, if just-just don't let my husband catch you there There is some similarity between the melody used by Estes and the melody used by Arnold for his four-line verses of his record. Some have concluded that Estes's song is an earlier version of the same song. This is disputed by Boyd and Kelly. Another different song was recorded by Big Bill Broonzy in March 1934. Melodically it differs from all the songs with the same title. Lyrically, it shares with the Kokomo Arnold song: *A dairy cow theme – :I haven't seen my milk cow in three long weeks today :I haven't had no rich cream, mama since my milk cow strayed away :Have you seen a big brown cow she have no horns at all :You don't need a chair to milk her she will back right in your stall *and a departed human lover – :When I got up this morning she had had every dime I had :I said that's all right, mule cow your daddy understand Robert Johnson song Robert Johnson recorded a version of Sleepy John Estes' song, re-titled \\"Milkcow's Calf Blues\\", at his last recording session on June 20, 1937. It was released by Vocalion Records in September 1937 as the B-side to \\"Malted Milk.\\" Johnnie Lee Wills version In 1941, Johnnie Lee Wills (younger brother of Bob Wills) recorded a version which was released the same year by Decca Records as \\"Milkcow Blues\\" by Johnny Lee Wills & His Boys. It was sung by Cotton Thompson. Bob Wills also recorded it on the Tiffany Transcriptions with a vocal by Tommy Duncan. The Wills/Duncan release \\"Brain Cloudy Blues\\" is heavily influenced by \\"Milk Cow Blues\\" too. Elvis Presley version Elvis Presley, on guitar, accompanied by Scotty Moore on guitar recorded a rockabilly version retitled \\"Milkcow Blues Boogie\\" at Sun Records in November or December 1954. The arrangement was closer to Wills' version than to the Arnold original. Elvis begins the song as a slow ballad, then adds a spoken interlude by halting after the first four lines: \\"Hold it, fellas! That don't MOVE me! Let's get real, real gone for a change,\\" prompting the trio to kick it into rockabilly gear. Sun Records released the song as a single on January 8, 1955, with \\"You're a Heartbreaker\\" as the flipside. RCA Victor Records also released the single in December 1955. It was later included on Presley's 1959 album A Date with Elvis.

He is best known for directing the team that invented the Reactable. He is also a trained Physicist. Life and career Sergi Jordà was born in Madrid, where his father was directing the film El Día de los Muertos (1961). His father was the award-winning Catalan film director and writer Joaquín Jordà. Sergi Jordà graduated with a BSc in Fundamental Physics from the Universitat de Barcelona in 1987 while also completing music studies. He was an early adopter of computer programming devoted to live computer music, and one of the pioneers of this field in Spain. During the 1990s he conducted doctorate studies in Artificial Intelligence with the UNED and collaborated with renowned Catalan artists Marcel.lí Antúnez Roca or La Fura dels Baus on award-winning interactive installations (Joan the Meat Man and Epizoo, 1996), multimedia performances (Afasia, 2002), and applications for collaborative music creation over the Internet (FMOL, 1999–2002). In 1999 he joined Dr Xavier Serra who was establishing the Music Technology Group at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona. Sergi Jordà's doctorate dissertation Digital Lutherie (Jordà, 2005) at UPF-MTG set the foundations for new kinds of musical computers for performance and improvisation, based on visual feedback and spatial multiplexion. Between 2003 and 2006, together with Günter Geiger, Martin Kaltenbrunner and Marcos Alonso, Sergi Jordà developed the Reactable: an electronic music instrument combining a tangible tabletop interface with principles derived from modular synthesizers such as those developed by Bob Moog in the early 1960s. The Reactable was popularised by Björk, who incorporated it into her 2007 Volta Tour. It has since been performed extensively and is on display in numerous science and art centres worldwide, including the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, Discovery World in Milwaukee, Discovery Place in Charlotte, Montréal Science Centre, Science Centre Singapore, Museo Papalote del Niño in Mexico, Santralistanbul in Turkey, the ZKM in Germany or the INTECH centre in the UK. In October 2010 Reactable mobile launched for the iPhone and the iPad and within 2 weeks became top music application download in 20 countries.

On the morning of July 12, 1888, the incident occurred when a trestle collapsed as a passenger train was atop it. Virginia Midland Railroad's Train 52—\\"The Piedmont Airline\\"—was crossing the , trestle known as the \\"Fat Nancy\\" when it gave way, sending the train to the ground. By 1888, many states had experienced memorable wrecks with high death tolls. Though Virginia newspapers were full of reports of small train accidents, there were typically few deaths. The wreck at Fat Nancy was Virginia's first experience with a train crash that resulted in multiple deaths and large-scale injuries. Five passengers, one rail employee, one mail clerk, and one newsboy were killed and another mail clerk died from his injuries the following day. At least twenty-six were injured, though some reports list a higher number.Virginia Railroad Commissioner, Annual Report of the railroad commissioner of the state of Virginia, 1888-1889 (Richmond, Va: R.F. Walker, Superintendent of Public Printing, 1889): xi. The incident is named for the trestle, known as the \\"Fat Nancy\\" for the woman who served as the trestle watcher. The trestle's official name was Browning Trestle, for the owners of the property on which it sits, or Two-Runs trestle for the creek that ran below. A local African-American woman who waved to train conductors and occasionally received a shovelful of coal inspired locals to rename the trestle as Fat Nancy's trestle. The Baltimore Sun reported that the woman's actual name was Emily Jackson and described a woman of \\"great size and uncouth appearance.\\" One of the deceased was Cornelius G. Cox, the civil engineer who had designed a culvert to replace the trestle, which was known to be unstable. After the collapse, the area was filled with earth and a graphite culvert placed over the stream, per his design. One of the surviving passengers was former Confederate Lieutenant General James Longstreet, who was returning from the 25th reunion of the Battle of Gettysburg. The culvert that replaced the trestle still stands today, where it allows Laurel Creek to flow through. Tracks no longer cross the culvert—they're now to the south. The Virginia Department of Historic Resources erected a historical marker at the site of the wreck, along Virginia State Route 20, in 2007.

Formed in Moscow in 1922, the division spent most of the interwar period at Vladimir. After moving to the Kola Peninsula during the Winter War, the division fought on that front during the Continuation War. After the end of the Continuation War it became the 101st Guards Rifle Division. The division reformed in 1955 from the 180th Rifle Division but became the 88th Motor Rifle Division in 1957.  History   First formation  It was formed in Moscow on 1 July 1922. The division headquarters and the 40th Rifle Regiment were stationed at Vladimir. The 41st Rifle Regiment was in Murom and the 42nd Rifle Regiment at Kovrov. The division transferred to the Leningrad Military District in Vologda during the late 1930s. Its regiments were deployed in Vologda, Arkhangelsk and Cherepovets. In September 1939, the regiments were each expanded to division strength, resulting in the formation of the 88th Rifle Division and 168th Rifle Division. On 11 September 1939, its headquarters moved to Murmansk. During the Winter War, it covered the Soviet border on the northern and northeastern coast of the Kola Peninsula as part of the Murmansk Group. It saw World War II operational service (Russian: part of the 'operational army') from 22 June 1941 to 14 Nov 1944. On 22 Jun 1941, the division was stationed on the part of the front length of 300 kilometers along the coast of the Kola Peninsula from Cape Saint Nose to the island Kildin. It appears to have been part of the 14th Army. On the night of 22 Jun 1941, the two regiments of the division and a reconnaissance battalion were deployed to the border with Finland, and occupied the area from the Barents Sea to Ukhta. On 25 June 1941 the division was reinforced by two regiments of the 52nd Rifle Division. On 29 Jun 1941, parts of Mountain Corps Norway after an artillery preparation and with bomber support launched an attack on the division (part of Operation Silver Fox).

Sung by young Muslim Arab children and led by Dima Bashar and her older brother Mohammed Bashar, in 2010 the song became a hit on YouTube as well as Arabic and worldwide websites. The song was harshly criticized by Saudi journalist Fawzia Nasir al-Naeem, who argues that it indoctrinates children into bloodshed and terrorism. Background The choir Toyor Al Janah was founded in 1994 by Jordanian-Palestinian businessman Khaled Maqdad. The television channel, which began operating in 2008, was also established by Maqdad, who says: \\"The channel has captured the hearts of millions of children. It succeeds where the educational system has failed, such as multiplication table songs. It helps teachers work on it with the children.\\" Saudi journalist Fawzia Nasir al-Naeem wrote that the choir \\"is one of the most widely distributed children's song groups in the Arab world, and it seems to have crossed the ocean to Canada and Britain.\\" Dr. Hamad Al-Majid, a journalist and former member of the official Saudi National Organization for Human Rights, writes: \\"Birds of Paradise produced content has swept Arab satellite channels, becoming some of the most popular programming for Arab children. This company pursues a policy of resisting Israeli occupation via producing innocent songs for children, and some of these songs which can be found on YouTube have been viewed by as many as four million people.\\" Description The song's video portrays Palestinian children playing, singing and dancing in a village, when they are gunned down by other children, dressed as Israeli soldiers. The children portraying Israeli soldiers are wearing yarmulkes. At the end of the video, other Palestinian children avenge the killing of their friends by killing the \\"Israeli\\" children. The song begins with a young girl singing: \\"When we seek martyrdom, we go to heaven. You tell us we're small, but from this way of life we have...\\" As the video progresses, a young man continues the song: \\"Children, we must keep our religious commandments. There is no god but Allah, and Allah loves shaheeds\\" (Islamic martyrs). Gaza City concerts In August 2010, Toyor Al Janah gave two live performances in Gaza City, where Muqdad, the founder of the group, attended a formal welcoming ceremony given by Hamas in the honor of the choir. Muqdad said that the concert would \\"affirm to the entire world the right of the children of Palestine to live in freedom and dignity.\\" The concerts were performed during an Islamic music festival, and both were attended by thousands of people, who were \\"blown away\\" by the young performers.

Early life  Josephine Cecilia Diebitsch Peary was born Josephine Cecilia Diebitsch in Washington, D.C. on May 22, 1863. Her mother, Magdalena Augusta Schmid Diebitsch, was from Saxony. Her father, Hermann Henry Diebitsch, was a military officer from Prussia. During the American Civil War, the Diebitsch family farm was destroyed, which led the family to relocate to Washington, D.C. Hermann later became a clerk in the Exchange Department at the Smithsonian Institution. She had a brother, Emil Diebitsch, who later became the mayor of Nutley, New Jersey, and a sister Miss Marie Diebitsch. Josephine attended Spencerian Business College and graduated as the class valedictorian in 1880. She found herself qualified and on track for a copyist, clerk, and tallyist position at the Smithsonian Institution and the United States Department of the Interior. Josephine wrote My Arctic Journal (1893) during her 1891-1892 expedition.  Marriage and Family  Robert Edwin Peary was born in Pennsylvania in 1856. He attended Bowdoin College, in Brunswick, Maine. Josephine first met Robert in 1885 while she was attending dancing school. She later married him on August 11, 1888. She often accompanied him on his northern travels, where she traveled farther North over the ice fields than any white woman had before. She accompanied him on six of his Arctic expeditions and was considered a First Lady of the Arctic. Her eagerness to explore the world prompted her to accompany her husband on his second expedition to Greenland from 1891-1892. While they were married, Robert Peary successfully led an expedition to the North Pole, thus earning him the title of the first white man to explore the Arctic. At this time Josephine stayed home on Eagle Island in Casco Bay, Maine, which Robert bought in 1877. Josephine and Robert had two children. Marie Ahnighito Peary born in 1893, who became known as \\"Snow Baby\\", was born less than thirteen degrees from the North Pole. Her son was named Robert E. Peary Jr. Although both children were Arctic adventurers, Robert Jr. later became a construction engineer. They also had three grandchildren, Edward Peary Stafford, Robert E. Peary III, and Peary Diebitsch Stafford. Robert Peary died on February 20, 1920. After his death, Josephine settled in Portland, Maine, in 1932. Peary died on December 19, 1955, when she was 92 years old.

The park is a signature Baltimore landmark and offers visitors some of the most noted views in the city often photographed looking north to the downtown skyline of skyscrapers across the Inner Harbor (formerly known as \\"The Basin\\") of the Northwest Branch of the Patapsco River / Baltimore Harbor. The Federal Hill surrounding neighborhood to the west and south is named for the prominent hill and is also known as old South Baltimore. The now graded grass lawn hill and park, was originally a jagged cliffs and bluffs of red clay which was mined in the 18th and 19th centuries after being first sighted and described by Captain John Smith of England on his voyages of exploration of the Chesapeake Bay from the first English colony at Jamestown, Virginia in 1608. The noted famous site today is bounded by Francis Scott Key Highway (Key Highway / Maryland Route 2) along the waterfront to the north, Battery Avenue to the west, Warren Avenue to the south, and Covington Street to the east. Baltimore city acquired the hill as public property in 1880 after it was used and fortified as a fort with heavy artillery (Fort Federal Hill) by the Union Army during the American Civil War (1861-1865). It was established then as a city park operated and maintained by the city Department of Recreation and Parks. History John Smith’s Hill The first Anglo Saxon to discover Federal Hill Park was the celebrated English colonial explorer and settler Captain John Smith (1580-1631). In June 1608, Smith sailed from Jamestown up the Chesapeake Bay for a 19-day journey that ended with a voyage up the Patapsco River which he named \\"Bolus\\" for \\"red\\". It was there that Smith reported seeing \\"a great red bank of clay flanking a natural harbor basin.\\" Early Baltimore Town settlers originally referred to this area as \\"John Smith’s Hill\\". The Federalist In May 1788, Baltimoreans paraded through the streets to celebrate the State of Maryland’s ratification of the United States Constitution the seventh state of the first nine required out of the Original 13 to do so. The parade featured a 15-foot scale model of a fully rigged sailing ship named the \\"Federalist\\" led by then young naval hero Joshua Barney that was to be installed atop John Smith’s Hill. The day turned into quite a celebration; the thousands of celebrants were treated to \\"untold quantities\\" of grog, toddy, beef, ham, and cheese, financed by leading Baltimore business scions. Revelers were having so much fun that they opted to slide the Federalist down the hill and launch it from \\"The Basin\\" (today\\"s Inner Harbor) to be sailed later down the Chesapeake Bay to the state capital at Annapolis, following then up the Potomac River to be presented to retired Continental Army General George Washington at his riverfront Mount Vernon estate plantation. This celebration was so legendary that Baltimoreans renamed ‘John Smith’s Hill’ in tribute to the party boat. Hence the origin of the Park’s name: \\"Federal Hill\\". Observatory Federal Hill's views were first put to commercial use in 1795 when, in cooperation with the Maritime Exchange, Captain David Porter established a \\"marine observatory\\" and signal tower on the site. The tower provided a panorama that stretched a good 15 miles or more down the Patapsco River. Spotting an incoming ship, the watchman would unfurl the observatory's \\"house flag\\" to alert the merchants and ship owners at the Maritime Exchange of an imminent arrival. War of 1812 and the Battle of Baltimore A military battery was built on Federal Hill in anticipation of an attack by sea from the British who had occupied, raided and terrorized the Chesapeake Bay region during 1813-1814, under notorious Rear Admiral George Cockburn. Although there was never an attack in the first year of the enemy campaign in 1813 with only some probings and soundings of the channel depths, finally on September 12, 1814, the vaunted Royal Navy fleet brought 3,000 British troops and supplies, landing southeast of the city at North Point and marched north and west up the Patapsco Neck peninsula to attack the city. That night, they reached Loudenschlager's and Potter Hills (later renamed Hampstead Hill in today's Patterson Park) on the east side of the town where 10,000 Americans from three surrounding states and an estimated 100 cannon /artillery pieces heavily dug in, under the leadership of Major General Samuel Smith of the Maryland Militia, blocked the invading army’s path. Two statues in memory of two of the three major battle commanders (General Smith and Maj. George Armistead) commemorate this important victory adorn the north side slope of Federal Hill Park today. On the following day, September 13, British ships moved north up the Patapsco and began firing a two day long barrage of rockets, shells and bombs at Fort McHenry guarding the harbor at the tip of the Whetstone Point peninsula; Major George Armistead and 1,000 patriot defenders retaliated with their cannons, when the British ships sailed within range. Realizing their attack on the city had failed, the British sailed down river to North Point to pick up their retreating soldiers. The Battle of Baltimore was over. The memorials to Smith and Armistead and their brave troops now occupies the northeast corner of Federal Hill Park, as it has since 1885 with the Armistead statue, with the Smith sculpture moved here in the early 1970s. Civil War and Fort Federal Hill The hill gained notoriety during the Civil War (1861-1865) when Federal Hill was once again converted to military use in as the 6th Massachusetts Militia and elements of Cook’s Light Artillery of Boston occupied Federal Hill under the command of General Benjamin F. Butler. In May 1861, against Washington’s orders, Butler and his men erected a small fort, with numerous cannon pointing towards the central business district across the Basin. Their goal was to guarantee the allegiance of the city and the state of Maryland, whose loyalty to the North was in some doubt. The Union finally encircled the existing military installation with a wall and for the duration of the Civil War, the property was referred to as Fort Federal Hill. A large flag, a few cannon, and a small Grand Army of the Republic for Civil War veterans monument remain to testify to this period of the hill’s history. 19th and 20th century For much of the 19th century, the Federal Hill shore shared with Fell's Point the city's thriving shipping trade and related industries. Federal Hill itself was mined for sand for a nearby glassworks, leaving behind some caverns which exist to this day and are a favorite subject of legends. Modern Federal Hill was born in the 1960s, when a few hardy pioneers bought and began renovating homes in what had become a forgotten neighborhood. Federal Hill was threatened in the mid-60 by plans for an interstate highway. Residents rebelled, joined hands across the harbor, and eventually quashed the plans. The rebuilding of the Inner Harbor area in the late 70s and early 80s greatly increased interest in Federal Hill as an enclave of intimate residential streets within minutes of the city’s business and entertainment heart. Due to the traffic and development, particularly at the foot of the Hill along Key Highway and Covington Street, the Hill has collapsed at least twice during the last 10 years, requiring the City to fund major reconstructive efforts to preserve Federal Hill Park. One refurbishment project was completed in 1995 and in 2000, the park was rededicated after a nearly $2 million stabilization project to combat an erosion problem. Present day Today, Federal Hill Park captures one of the most iconic views of the Inner Harbor. The \\"great red bank of clay\\" is now a big green hillside, used by picnickers and star-gazers. Monuments commemorating history enhance the Park, cannons that once manned at Fort Federal Hill during the Civil War are featured, as well, embellishing the promenade that overlooks the downtown cityscape. Bikers, hikers and parents behind strollers are common in the park. Recreation At the foot of Federal Hill Park lie recreational features such as a basketball court (recently renovated by Baltimore-based Under Armour sportswear) and Rash Field, containing a variety of events and activities including beach volleyball and a gated kids playground area.

By 2014, three of the band's classic four members — lead singer Karlos \\"Mahoma\\" Agirreurreta, bassist \\"Portu\\" Mancebo and guitarist Jul Bolinaga — had died.  History  1981–1983: The beginning In 1981, the Bolinaga brothers Jul and Txerra formed a band called Doble Cero, along with bassist and singer Eduardo Mancebo, a.k.a. \\"Portu\\". They added Juan Luis Mallabi as lead singer, and initially pursued a hardcore punk direction. Mallabi was then drafted for military service, and was replaced by the group manager Karlos Agirreurreta, best known as \\"Mahoma\\", i.e. Muhammad. When Mallabi returned to the band, tensions escalated between him and \\"Mahoma\\", making Mallabi walk out from the group. 1984–1988: Breakthrough, No Te Muevas and first hiatus The remaining members renamed the band as RIP, releasing the maxi-single Zona Especial Norte in 1984, edited by the label Basati Diskak, shared with Eskorbuto.Zona Especial Norte at Allmusic.com In 1985, although they could only get an independent record deal, releasing their first live album: 83 84 Elgoibar Vitoria Lasarte Barna, this recording has subsequently become more widely available as cassette (then as CD re-issue by Destruye!!! Records in 2006). RIP opened the Euskal Rock festival, at Barcelona in November 1985, along with La Polla Records, Kortatu and Cicatriz. In 1987, they launched their only full studio album No Te Muevas,No Te Muevas y Zona Especial Norte at Allmusic.com released by the label Basati Diskak. It is generally regarded as one of the most important albums in the history of Basque and Spanish punk. But then in 1988, the members broke up the band. In 1991, the band reconvened to play in a concert for the Arrasate Press festival, at Mondragón. 1994–2003: Reunion and final break-up While Fermin Muguruza was working on a festival in 1994, he and his own label Esan Ozenki, invited Mahoma, Jul, Txerra and Portu to share the show with another bands, officially reunited as RIP. By 1995, the reunion show was released on CD as HIESari Aurre Egiten!!. On 1996 Portu died from a heroin overdose, replaced by his brother Xabi temporally. In 2001, RIP recorded for the last time a new song, \\"Anti-Politica\\", for the compilation {{langeusGaztetxeak martxan!} In 2003 Karlos \\"Mahoma\\" died from cancer, and that was the end of the band. In parallel, Jul and Txerra formed by 2003 with Evaristo Páramos the short-lived group The Kagas, then The Meas in 2004. On 15 November 2014, the band's co-founding member, Jul Bolinaga, died in Guipúzcoa while performing with his band The Potes. His death, at the age of 50, was the result of a heart attack.

A tribute to the more than 600 nuns who nursed soldiers of both armies during the American Civil War, it is one of two monuments in the District that mark women's roles in the conflict.Jacob, Kathryn Allmong. Testament to Union: Civil War monuments in Washington, Part 3. JHU Press, 1998, p. 125-126. It is a contributing monument to the Civil War Monuments in Washington, D.C., listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1993, it was surveyed for the Smithsonian Institution's Save Outdoor Sculpture! program. Description The face of the sculpture has a large bronze bas relief panel showing 12 nuns dressed in traditional habit. This panel is installed on a rectangular granite slab that sits on a granite base. Each end of the slab has a bronze female figure seated. The proper right-side figure has wings, a helmet, robes, and armor to look like an angel, representing patriotism. Sitting, she holds a shield in her proper left hand and a scroll in her lap with her proper right hand. She is weaponless, to represent peace. On the proper left side of the slab, another winged figure sits wearing a long dress, a bodice, and a scarf around her head to represent the angel of Peace. Her hands are folded on her lap. The lower right side of the relief is signed: JEROME CONNOR 1924 The lower left side of the relief is inscribed: :BUREAU BROS. :BRONZE FOUNDERS PHILA :ENN On the granite above the relief is inscribed: :THEY COMFORTED THE DYING, NURSED THE WOUNDED, CARRIED HOPE TO :THE IMPRISONED, GAVE IN HIS NAME A DRINK OF WATER TO THE THIRSTY.

Artist Jerome Connor Born in Ireland in 1874, Jerome Connor moved at the age of 14 with his family to Massachusetts. His father was a stonemason, which led to Connor's jobs in New York as a sign painter, stonecutter, bronze founder, and machinist. Inspired by his father's work and his own experience, Connor used to steal his father's chisels as a child and carve figures into rocks. In 1899, he moved into the Roycroft Institution where he helped with blacksmithing and eventually began making terracotta busts and reliefs. During four years at Roycroft, he became well known as a sculptor, and was commissioned to create civic works in bronze for placement in Washington, D.C., Syracuse, East Aurora, New York, San Francisco, and Ireland. In 1925, he moved back to Ireland and opened his own studio in Dublin, but found few patrons and his work slowed. He died on August 21, 1943, of heart failure. There is a plaque in his honour on Infirmary Road, overlooking Dublin's Phoenix Park, with the words of his friend the poet Patrick Kavanagh: :He sits in a corner of my memory :With his short pipe, holding it by the bowl, :And his sharp eye and his knotty fingers :And his laughing soul :Shining through the gaps of his crusty wall. History The idea for the monument originated with Ellen Jolly, president of the women's auxiliary branch of the Ancient Order of Hibernians who grew up hearing stories of battlefield tales told by nuns. Proposing the sculpture just after the turn of the century, her request was denied by the War Department until proof of service was provided. For ten years Jolly worked to gather evidence and presented it to Congress in 1918. The sculpture was authorized by Congress on March 29, 1918 with the agreement that the government would not fund it. A committee, led by Jolly, on behalf of the Ancient Order of the Hibernians, raised $50,000 for the project. Jerome Connor was chosen since he focused on Irish Catholic themes, being one himself. Acquisition The female bronze figure on the representing Peace on the side of the memorial. A construction delay was caused due to the final location of the sculpture. Jerome Connor wanted the sculpture either at Arlington National Cemetery or at the Pan American Union Building. Neither choice was supported by the War Department or the DC Fine Arts Commission and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers decided on the final location near Dupont Circle. Once the location was chosen, the Arts Commission requested that the sculpture be changed by Connor. They requested that he alter the size, move inscriptions on the front, rearrange the front steps and make the angels \\"active.\\" A year later, in 1919, Congress finally approved of the design. Construction began on July 28, 1924. Finally, Jerome Connor ended up suing the Ancient Order of the Hibernians for nonpayment. The monument was dedicated on September 20, 1924 as part of a weekend long meeting of over 5,000 Catholics from all over the country. One nun, Sister Magdeline of the Sisters of Mercy, who served in the Civil War attended the event and was received with a \\"thunderous applause.\\" Archbishop O'Connell of Boston spoke and upon finishing, Jolly revealed the sculpture by removing an American flag that covered it. Sailors hoisted signal flags spelling \\"faith, hope and charity\\" and a flock of white pigeons were released. Information The nuns represented on the relief are from the Sisters of St. Joseph, Carmelites, Dominican Order, Ursulines, Sisters of the Holy Cross, Poor Sisters of St. Francis, Sisters of Mercy, Congregation of the Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy, Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul, Sisters of Charity of Nazareth, Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, and Congregation of Divine Providence.

Hammond Middle School in 2017 Francis C. Hammond Middle School in Alexandria, Virginia, is located at 4646 Seminary Road in the west end of the city. Opened as a four-year high school in 1956, it was named after Alexandria native Francis Hammond (1931–1953), a U.S. Navy hospital corpsman who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions in the Korean War. Francis C. Hammond Middle School applied to be part of the International Baccalaureate program in 2010. It has since ended its involvement. History In 1971, Alexandria City Public Schools (ACPS) changed to a 6-2-2-2 system, and reassigned its three high schools from four-year to two-year campuses. The newest and most geographically central, T.C. Williams, took all of the city's juniors and seniors, while Hammond and George Washington split the freshmen and sophomores. Prior to the consolidation, the city was approximately one- fifth black, but Hammond High School's student body in the spring of 1971 was nearly all white. Both Hammond and George Washington became junior high schools in 1979, with grades 7-9, and middle schools in 1993, with grades 6-8. In 2009, Morton Sherman, superintendent for ACPS, introduced a new plan for the school system's two middle schools, to have numerous schools inside one building. This was designed to allow students to have a more personalized education in smaller schools. Hammond had 3 schools (e.g., FCH 1, FCH2, FCH3), while George Washington Middle School had two schools (e.g. GW1, GW2). Starting in the 2014–15 school year the schools were unified again, with students either attending Francis C. Hammond or George Washington. Demographics As of September 2014, the 1436 students at Francis C. Hammond are 35% African American, 40% Hispanic, 14% White, 8% Asian, 1.2% Multi- racial, 1% Native American, and 0.4% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander.

Pooley was born in West Ham, east London and trained at the Northern Polytechnic in the evenings, while working in the West Ham engineer's department by day. He qualified as an architect, planner and surveyor before serving with the Royal Engineers during World War II . He also qualified as a structural engineer and arbitrator. He married Hilda in 1944 and had three daughters and lived in Whiteleaf, outside Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. He was a supporter of mid- ranking architects, and ensured that project/job architects' names were put on all Buckinghamshire County Council buildings, not just the county architect, and promoted this idea to the wider profession.The Times, Tuesday, 25 September 1973; pg. 16; Issue 58896 He was noted for his strong support of public transport, firstly with his monorail proposals for the new city that became Milton Keynes, and his later role in London where he identified the growing problem of the car and its impact on the city.The Times, Friday, 19 July 1974; pg. 4; Issue 59143 Career After World War II, he joined the borough of West Ham as deputy architect and planner and then moved to Coventry in the same role where he helped plan the country's first pedestrianised city centre.Finch, Paul, Architects' Journal 26 March 1998 In 1953 he moved to Buckinghamshire County Council to become County Architect. Following his modern work in West Ham and Coventry, and his dramatic 1966 county hall building in Aylesbury, his architectural style became restrained; being more contextual and rural, predominately being brick with pitched roofs. In 1973 he became president of the Royal Institute of British Architects for two years.The Times, Tuesday, 8 May 1973; pg. 4; Issue 58776 As well has sorting out various conflicts within the institute, he used his time to promote the broader benefits of architects at all levels of government, and in 1974 he was quoted in Parliament by Sydney Chapman with regards to the boom and bust construction cycles: \\"The hand operated tap that used to produce stop-go in the building industry must be replaced by an automatic ball valve designed to allow sufficient work to flow to the industry to keep it working at the right level.\\"Hansard February 1974 vol 868 cc1055-175 One of Pooley's last important works for the county was the establishment of Buckingham as a university town, which eventually became Buckingham University, Britain's first independent university.

Built on a tall hill, it is accessible via a flight of steps. The temple's main shrines and its two prakarams (outer courtyards) are on top of the hill, while a hall and the temple tank are located at the foothills. Shiva is believed to have transformed himself into an ant hill and tilted his head at this place to enable ants to climb up and worship him. Erumbeeswarar is revered in the canonical 7th-century Tamil Saiva work the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as nayanmars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam. The temple is one in a series built by Aditya Chola (871-907 CE) along the banks of river Cauvery, to commemorate his victory in the Tirupurambiyam Battle. It has several inscriptions from the Chola Empire dating back to the 10th century. The temple has been declared a protected monument by the Archaeological Survey of India and is locally referred as \\"Kailash of South India\\". The temple has six daily rituals at various times from 5:30 am to 8:00 pm, and three yearly festivals in its calendar. The annual Brahmotsavam (prime festival) is attended by thousands of devotees from far and near. Every full moon, tens of thousands of pilgrims worship Erumbeeswarar by circumambulating the hill barefoot in a practise called girivalam. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu.  Etymology  thumb According to Hindu legend, there lived a demon (asura) Tharukasuran, who conquered Prithvi (earth) and Svarga (heaven). Indra, the leader of celestial deities and other gods suffered at the hands of Tharukasuran and sought the help of the creator-god Brahma, who asked them to worship Shiva in Thiruverumbur. In order to deceive Tharukasuran, the devas transformed into ants and reached the temple. Since the surface of the lingam (aniconic form of Shiva) was slippery, the ants found it difficult to climb up and worship. Shiva transformed himself into an ant hill and slid his head, which enabled the ants to climb and worship. Hence the name Erumbeeswarar is derived from Erumbu meaning ant and Easwaran referring to Shiva. This is one of the three places where Shiva slid his head for his worshippers, the other two being the temples at Virinjipuram and Thiruppanandal. The temple is also referred as Rathinakoodam, Thirverumbipuram, Erumbeesam, Brahmapuram, Laskhmipuram, Madhuvanam, Rathnakoodapuram, Manikoodapuram and Kumarapuram in various religious literature. The temple is locally called as Kailash (the abode of Shiva) of South India. History Erumbeeswarar temple in its current form was built by the Chola king Aditya I (871-907 CE). Aditya won a battle in Tirupurambiyam and to commemorate the victory, he built a series of temples along the banks of the river Cauvery. The temple has 49 inscriptions from the Chola period (850-1280 CE). The inscriptions numbered 101, 104, 105, 127, 130 and 133 of 1914 are believed to be inscribed during the 5th to 7th year of the reign of Aditya and hence believed to be between 882 and 885 CE. Another set of inscriptions from the Sundara Chola (957-970 CE) period indicate gift of land to maintain four signs of Tirupadigam. One another inscription indicates the donation of ten (a measure) of gold to the deity by a temple woman in the year 875 CE.Orr 2004, p. 65Orr 2004, p. 144 A king by name Siruthavur Sembian Veithi Velan from Kiliyurnadu is believed to have constructed the vimana (structure over the sanctum). The temple was the only temple that Malik Kafur (1296-1316 CE) could not conquer in 1311 CE, during his South Indian expedition. The temple is a declared monument of the Archaeological Survey of India on account of the inscriptions in the temple. During the war between British and French during 1752, the temple acted as an infantry for the French troops. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. The Temple thumb Erumbeeswarar temple is located atop a hill with a flight of granite steps to the top. Since the temple is atop a hill, it is locally called \\"Malai Kovil\\" (meaning hill temple). The temple complex has two prakarams (outer courtyard) and a two-tiered rajagopuram (gateway tower). The central shrine faces east and holds the image of Erumbeeswarar (Shiva) in the form of lingam made of mud mound. The granite images Ganesha (son of Shiva and god of wisdom), Murugan (son of Shiva and god of war), Nandi (the bull and vehicle of Shiva) and Navagraha (nine planetary deities) are in the hall leading to the sanctum. As in other Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu, the first precinct or the walls around the sanctum of Erumbeeswarar has images of Dakshinamurthy (god of knowledge), Durga (warrior-goddess) and Chandikeswarar (a saint and devotee of Shiva). The central image of Erumbeeswarar is made of mud mound and is referred by other names like Erumbeesar, Mathuvaneswarar, Manikoodalachapathi, Piplikesvarar and Manickanathar. The inscriptions in the temple refer Erumbeeswarar as Thirumalai Alwar, Thiruverumbur Alwar and Thiruverumburudaya Nayanar. The shrine of the consort-goddess Narunguzhal Nayagi Amman, facing south, is in the second precinct of the temple. The second precinct is surrounded by granite walls. Narunguzhal Nayagi Amman is referred by other names like Sugantha Kuzhalal, Soundra Nayagi, Madhuvaneswari and Rathnambal. The path around the foothills, called Girivalam Path, is wide and long. The construction and beautification of the path was carried out by the Tourism department of the government of Tamil Nadu in 2011. The temple has a garden maintained by Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL, Trichy). Worship and festivals thumb The temple priests perform the puja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. Like other Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Shaiva community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed six times a day; Ushathkalam at 5:30 a.m., Kalasanthi at 8:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 10:00 a.m., Sayarakshai at 5:00 p.m., Irandamkalam at 7:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 8:00 p.m. Each ritual comprises four steps: abhisheka (sacred bath), alangaram (decoration), naivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Erumbeeswarar and Narunguzhal Nayagi Amman. The worship is held amidst music with nagaswaram (pipe instrument) and tavil (percussion instrument), religious instructions in the Vedas (sacred texts) read by priests and prostration by worshippers in front of the temple mast. There are weekly rituals like ' (Monday) and ' (Friday), fortnightly rituals like pradosham and monthly festivals like amavasai (new moon day), kiruthigai, pournami (full moon day) and sathurthi. The major festival of the temple, the Brahmotsavam, is celebrated during the Tamil month of Vaikasi (May -June). Other festivals include Annabishekam during the Tamil month of Aipasi (October -November), Mahashivaratri and Pournami Girivalam. Every full moon, tens of thousands of pilgrims worship Erumbeeswarar by circumambulating the hill barefoot. The circumambulation covers the circumference of the hill, and is referred as girivalam.

Biography  Early life Ebba Lilliehöök was the only child of the riksråd Måns Bryntesson Lilliehöök (d. 1529) and Brita Jönsdotter Roos of Ervalla. Her father participated in the Westrogothian rebellion and was executed for his ambitions to become king. Her mother remarried riksråd Kristoffer Andersson Röde. In 1543, she accompanied her mother and stepfather in exile in Germany after a conflict between her stepfather and the king. Upon the death of her father in 1548, the king asked them to return to Sweden: Ebba was the heiress of substantial estates after her father, and the king wanted her to marry his brother-in-law.Tegenborg Falkdalen, Karin, Margareta Regina: vid Gustav Vasas sida : [en biografi över Margareta Leijonhufvud (1516-1551)], Setterblad, Stockholm, 2016 After negotiations with the queen and a written assurance of safety, Ebba returned to Sweden with her mother in the summer of 1548 and spent her remaining time until her wedding as a lady-in-waiting to the queen.Tegenborg Falkdalen, Karin, Margareta Regina: vid Gustav Vasas sida : [en biografi över Margareta Leijonhufvud (1516-1551)], Setterblad, Stockholm, 2016 Marriage On 7 October 1548, she married the noble Sten Eriksson, Baron and Count Leijonhufvud (1518–1568) in the presence of the King at the Royal Palace in Stockholm. Her spouse was the brother-in-law of King Gustav I and the brother of Queen Margaret Leijonhufvud, which gave them both an influential position at the royal court. Upon the coronation of Erik XIV in 1561, her spouse was created a Baron. In 1567, her spouse was one of two of the group of imprisoned nobles to survive the infamous Sture Murders, which killed among others the spouse of her sister-in-law Martha Leijonhufvud. During the event, Ebba was present in Uppsala with her sister-in-law in Uppsala and placed in house arrest to prevent them from interfering.Tegenborg Falkdalen, Karin, Vasadrottningen: en biografi över Katarina Stenbock 1535-1621 [The Vasa Queen: A biography of Catherine Stenbock, 1535-1621], Historiska media, Lund, 2015 Ebba was held \\"in high regard and respect\\" by the brothers of the King, the future John III of Sweden and Charles IX of Sweden, and a personal friend of John's spouse Catherine Jagellon.Tegenborg Falkdalen, Karin, Vasadrottningen: en biografi över Katarina Stenbock 1535-1621 [The Vasa Queen: A biography of Catherine Stenbock, 1535-1621], Historiska media, Lund, 2015 She and her spouse participated in convincing the royal brothers to rebel against the King, financed by sister-in-law Martha Leijonhufvud, resulting in Erik XIV being replaced by John III in 1568.Tegenborg Falkdalen, Karin, Vasadrottningen: en biografi över Katarina Stenbock 1535-1621 [The Vasa Queen: A biography of Catherine Stenbock, 1535-1621], Historiska media, Lund, 2015 \\"Count Ebba\\" In 1568, her spouse was given the title of Count at his death bed, having sustained an injury after being imprisoned by Erik XIV. Ebba received the title of Count and was in 1571 granted the County of Raseborg in Finland as a fief. She thereby became, alongside her sisters-in-law Brita and Martha Leijonhufvud, one of the five greatest fief holders in Sweden during the reign of John III. She was generally known as \\"Count Ebba\\", as it was said, for her \\"masculine\\" ways.Lilliehöök, Ebba von i Wilhelmina Stålberg, Anteckningar om svenska qvinnor (1864) Her feud with her son attracted a lot of attention, and there were a lot of stories about their many conflicts. On one occasion, in 1604 for example, there was a story about her son preventing her chef from serving her after having served him bad food on her orders. By her contemporaries, Count Ebba was described as a: \\"A hair of the Devil himself, worse than her father, her son Axel and his sons\\".Lilliehöök, Ebba von i Wilhelmina Stålberg, Anteckningar om svenska qvinnor (1864) She herself commented about the ongoing conflict stating: \\"I am the mother and he is the son\\".Lilliehöök, Ebba von i Wilhelmina Stålberg, Anteckningar om svenska qvinnor (1864) Count Ebba was also politically controversial.

The temple is situated close to the base of the Rockfort and was constructed by the Pallava king Mahendravarman I in the 6th century AD. Shiva is worshiped as Thayumanavar, and is represented by the lingam and his consort Parvati is depicted as Mattuvar Kuzhalammai. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the nayanars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam. According to Hindu legend, a pregnant woman named Rathnavathi was an ardent devotee of Shiva and he arrived in the form of her mother to attend to her delivery. The presiding deity is thus named Thayumanaswamy, the one who acted as mother. The Rockfort is a fortress which stands atop a 273-foot-high rock, consisting of a set of monolithic rocks accommodating many rock-cut cave temples. Originally built by the Pallavas, it was later reconstructed by the Madurai Nayaks and Vijayanagara rulers. The major complex in the temple are believed to be built during the 8th century by the Pandyan Empire. The temple has six daily rituals at various times from 5:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., and twelve yearly festivals on its calendar. The Chittirai festival during the Tamil month of Chittirai (April - May) is celebrated for fifteen days, portraying the various incidents associated with the temple legend. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend left According to Hindu legend, a pregnant woman named Rathnavathi was an ardent devotee of Shiva. While nearing labor, she requested her mother to come over. Her mom could not reach on account of heavy floods in river Cauvery. As delivery time came closer, Rathnavathi prayed to Shiva. Shiva, moved by the devotion of Rathnavathi, took the form of Rathnavathi's mother and helped with her smooth delivery. After the delivery, Shiva vanished and Rathnavathi's mother arrived later. The family came to know that it was Shiva who attended to the delivery. Henceforth, Shiva in the temple came to be known as Thayumanaswamy, meaning the Lord who acted like a Mother. The temple obtained the name from the presiding deity, Thayumanaswamy.M.K.V. 2007, p. 73 Shiva disguised himself as a mother for a pregnant lady, leading to the name Thayumanavar, meaning the one who became a mother. According to Hindu mythology, the city Tiruchirappalli derives its name from legend associated with the Thayumanaswamy temple. The three-headed demon Trishira, who meditated on Thayumanavar near the present-day city to obtain favours from the god. An alternative derivation, not universally accepted, is that the source of the city's name is the Sanskrit word \\"Trishirapuram\\"—Trishira, meaning \\"three- headed\\", and palli or puram meaning \\"city\\". As per another legend, due to a fight between Adisesha (serpent god) and Vayu (Wind god) to seek ownership of Himalayas, the eight pieces of the mountain fell to eight different places. One of them was Trincomalee in Sri Lanka, Srikalahasti at Andhra Pradesh and Rockfort. The place came to be known as Trisikarapuram as there are three peaks in the temple, one each for Shiva, Parvathi and Ganesha. History Shrine of Mattuvar Kuzhalammai Tiruchirapalli was a part of the Chola kingdom and it houses a number of exquisitely sculpted temples and fortresses, the centre of which is the Rockfort temple. The temple is built in the Dravidian style of architecture; The rock-cut cave temples of the Rockfort, along with the gateway and the Erumbeeswarar Temple, are listed as monuments of national importance by the Archaeological Survey of India. The Rockfort is a fortress which stands atop a 273-foot-high rock. It consists of a set of monolithic rocks accommodating many rock-cut cave temples. Originally built by the Pallavas, it was later reconstructed by the Madurai Nayaks and Vijayanagara rulers. The major complex in the temple are believed to be built during the 8th century by the Pandyan Empire. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Architecture thumb The temple complex has three shrines, two of which are dedicated to Lord Ganesha, one at the foot and the Ucchi Pillayar Temple at the top, and the Thayumanavar Temple between them. The Thayumanavar temple, the largest of the three, houses a shrine for Amman (the Goddess) as well as the main deity. The Rockfort is visible from almost every part of the city's north. The Teppakulam at the foot of the Rockfort is surrounded by bazaars. It has a mandapa at its centre and has facilities for boat riding. All the temple related float festivals are held in the tank. The temple is located halfway up the Rockfort. The temple has columned structure.

The lower level also houses the niches of Vinayagar, Arumugar, Navagrahas and Veerabadraswami. The walls around the central shrine houses the image of Dakshinamurthy, Somaskandar, Natarajar, Surya, Brahma and Durga.Knapp, p. 359 There were details that the temple layout was found in the Shanmata form. It had two principle shrines, Shiva in the east and Vishnu in the west and central bay. The reliefs of Skanda, Surya, Ganesh and Durga were found on the central bay. Worship and festivals Ceiling with stonechains The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. Like other Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Shaivaite community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed six times a day; Ushathkalam at 5:30 a.m., Kalasanthi at 8:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 10:00 a.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m., Irandamkalam at 8:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 10:00 p.m. Each ritual comprises four steps: abhisheka (sacred bath), alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Thayumanaswami and Mattuvar Kuzhal Amman. The worship is held amidst music with nagaswaram (pipe instrument) and tavil (percussion instrument), religious instructions in the Vedas read by priests and prostration by worshippers in front of the temple mast. There are weekly rituals like ' and ', fortnightly rituals like pradosham and monthly festivals like amavasai (new moon day), kiruthigai, pournami (full moon day) and sathurthi. The temple celebrates dozens of festivals throughout the year. The Chittirai festival during the Tamil month of Chittirai (April - May) is celebrated for fifteen days, portraying the various incidents associated with the temple legend. The car festival is held on the ninth day, when the processional deities of Thayumanswamy and Mattuvar Kuzhalammai are taken out in separate chariots around the temple in NSB Road, Nandikovil Street, North and East Andar streets and the Malaivasal. The Karthigai festival is celebrated during the Tamil month of Karthikai, between November and December, concluding with the celebration of Karthikai Deepam. A huge lamp is lit in a cauldron, containing three tons of ghee, at the top of the Malaikottai hills during the Deepam. To mark the occasion, the festival deity of Thayumanaswami circumambulates the mountain. Every full moon, tens of thousands of pilgrims worship Thayumanaswami by circumambulating the Tiruchirappalli hill barefoot. The circumambulation covers the circumference around the hill, and is referred as Girivalam. On the day of yearly Chitra Pournami, the full moon of the Tamil calendar, hundreds of thousands of pilgrims come from across the world to worship Thayumanaswami.

The Erdut Agreement (, , , , , ), officially the Basic Agreement on the Region of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium, was an agreement reached on 12 November 1995 between the authorities of the Republic of Croatia and the local Serb authorities of the Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia region on the peaceful resolution to the Croatian War of Independence in eastern Croatia. It initiated process of peaceful reintegration of the region to the central government control (implemented by the United Nations) and provided set of guarantees on minority rights and refugee return. It was named after Erdut, the village in which it was signed. The signers were Hrvoje Šarinić, the former prime minister of Croatia, and Milan Milanović, a local Serb politician representing the self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) under instructions from the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The witnesses were Peter Galbraith, the ambassador of the United States to Croatia at the time, and Thorvald Stoltenberg, the United Nations intermediary. The territory of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium had previously been controlled by the RSK, and before that by the SAO Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia. The agreement was acknowledged by the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1023, and it paved the way to the establishment of the United Nations Transitional Authority for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium. UNTAES was not designed as an ordinary UN mission but rather as an transitional administration, partially modeled on the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia, therefore providing the UNTAES with direct and supreme governing mandate over the region which was an effective United Nations protectorate. Background In 1995 mini Contact Group of foreign ambassadors in Zagreb drafted a comprehensive proposal to Croatian President Franjo Tuđman and the leaders of the Republic of Serbian Krajina in Knin aimed at peaceful resolution of the Croatian War of Independence. The proposal was known as the Z-4 Plan and it proposed reintegration of Krajina to Croatian constitutional framework on the basis of a new Constitutional Agreement which defined Krajina as an autonomous region of Croatia. The plan did not envisage special autonomy for Eastern Slavonia but rather two years long transitional period. Krajina leaders in Knin refused to receive the draft proposal which subsequently led to Operation Flash and Operation Storm and complete military defeat of Krajina resulting in over 200,000 Croatian Serb refugees who left their homes. Rump and geographically separated territory of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia (commonly known as Eastern Slavonia) remained the only part of Croatia under Serb control. Contrary to Krajina, Eastern Slavonia shared a long border with the Republic of Serbia. It was also economically and socially dependent and politically much more closely aligned with authorities in Belgrade and Novi Sad than Krajina. This led the international community to believe that Croatian intervention in Eastern Slavonia would trigger a military reaction from Yugoslavia and result in an escalation of hostilities. At the same time, the military defeat at Krajina and signing of the Washington Agreement opened the space to resolve the armed conflict in Bosnia which the US Administration wanted to use as poltical ammunition before the 1996 United States presidential election. Croatia conditioned its participation at the Dayton Peace Conference on the resolution of conflict in Eastern Slavonia, while international community insisted on avoidance of any new major escalation of Yugoslav crisis. This created conditions in which peaceful resolution was preferred or acceptable to all parties concerned. Agreement history As a part of his Bosnia peace efforts United States President Bill Clinton also stated: Despite territorial autonomy's prominent place in President Clinton's plans and effort by the US ambassador Peter Galbraith to model this autonomy proposal on recently suspended precedent of the Autonomous District of Glina and Knin from the Constitutional Act on National and Ethnic Communities or Minorities, this proposal was rejected by Croatian Government which preferred military solution over territorial autonomy. This convinced international community to focus on the models of non-territorial national personal autonomy, minority rights and inter-municipal cooperation. Provisions Return of refugees United Nations Transitional Administration was requested to ensure the possibility for the return of refugees and displaced persons to their homes of origin. The same rights were to be enjoyed both to those who have left the region or those who have come to the region from other parts of Croatia. Inter-communal power sharing Joint Implementation Committees formed both by local Croat and Serb communities assisted the UNTAES in governing the region. Local police forces were organized to have equal number of ethnic Croats and Ethnic Serbs plus additional smaller number from all the other communities in the region. Minority rights provisions The agreement itself and subsequent developments and commitments during the UNTAES mandate represent the basis on which numerous minority institutions operate today. Establishment of the Joint Council of Municipalities, with a Serbian majority population was one of explicit rights granted to the Serb community. Other institutions such as Serb National Council and weekly magazine Novosti were established at the same time, while some, such as Radio Borovo, were registered in accordance with Croatian laws. Agreement requires respect of the highest levels of internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms. International impact Erdut Agreement was quoted as an precedent and comparable case by the Ukrainian diplomats for implementation of Minsk II package of measures agreed within the framework of Minsk Protocol aimed at halting the War in Donbass.

Both appear primarily in the serial as a married couple between 1990 and 1992. Celestine makes a further guest appearance in 1993, while Etta makes a guest appearance in 1994, both visiting remaining members of the Tavernier family. Celestine is portrayed as a strict disciplinarian and a devout Christian who expects everyone in his family to show similar dedication to the church and abide by his rules. His unwavering demand for respect often alienates his children and almost causes the breakdown of his marriage. Also religious, Etta is portrayed as a career woman; her most prominent storylines concern marital problems and crises of faith. Storylines Backstory Celestine and Etta were born in Trinidad. Celestine was raised by his grandmother after his mother died and his father left to find work in Jamaica. He came to Britain in 1966, recruited by London Transport, with the intention of studying at evening classes for a white-collar job. It was a time when most West-Indians were expected to work on the buses or in hospitals and not to be too ambitious. However, he achieved his ambition, conformed and worked hard and eventually got promoted to manager at Walford Department of Social Security (DSS). Celestine married Etta in Jamaica and after the birth of their first son in 1968 she joined Celestine in England, later having two more children. Etta decided to train for a job that she knew she could do well - teaching. 1990–1994 Celestine and Etta and their three children, Clyde (Steven Woodcock), the oldest, and twins Hattie (Michelle Gayle) and Lloyd (Garey Bridges), move to Albert Square along with Celestine's father Jules (Tommy Eytle), when they are rehoused by the council in 1990 after Etta acquires a new job teaching at Walford Primary School. Celestine is put in an awkward position in 1990 when he discovers that Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher) is working and signing on for dole money at the same time. He eventually decides that he cannot 'turn a blind eye' to Arthur's fraudulent behaviour and turns him in to the authorities at his work, but his self-righteous attitude earns him few friends on the square. Celestine is unwavering with his expectations of his offspring. He demands respect and adherence at all times, and because of this he finds it extremely difficult to relate to his children, who often feel that his strict rules are harsh and unfair. Celestine has a tempestuous relationship with Clyde in particular. Clyde feels that his father has 'sold out' by accepting the prejudices of his bosses who are slow to promote him, whilst Celestine cannot relate to Clyde's lack of ambition. He is also regularly accused of turning his back on his roots by his father Jules and because Jules never went through Celestine's struggles for acceptance in a white community, he doesn't really understand his son. Celestine is a dedicated Church-goer and spends most of his spare time performing religious readings and educating 'young disciples' in the teachings of the Bible. Etta is also a devout Christian and a dedicated mother, but the big love of her life is teaching, so she is thrilled when she gets promoted to 'acting head' at Walford primary in 1991. However, Celestine blights what should have been a happy time for Etta by continuously arguing with her about her new job. Celestine, is unhappy about Etta's promotion as he feels threatened by her higher status and earning power and believes that she has deliberately set out to undermine his status as the head of the household. The rift between them nearly drives Celestine into the arms of another woman whom he had been mentoring in bible studies. The woman, Yvonne (Pamela Nomvete), wants more than friendship from Celestine and propositions him one night following a row with Etta. It is a testing time for Celstine, but the sanctity of marriage is more important to him and he manages to resist the temptation. Their marriage is tested again later in 1991 when Etta decides that she wants to undergo sterilization in order not to pass on her Sickle-cell gene to any future children (their youngest son Lloyd has already inherited the gene and his life has been severely limited because of this). Celestine refuses to entertain the idea, however, as he feels that such an act goes against their religious principles. Etta decides to go ahead with the sterilisation anyway, only to discover that she is already pregnant and that her unborn child is carrying a double dose of the sickle-cell gene. Upon realising this Celestine is forced to reappraise his priorities and to agree, unwillingly, to a termination. It is a traumatic time for the Taverniers, but the ordeal eventually manages to bring them closer and they emerge from it a much stronger couple. In 1992 Etta is offered a permanent role as head teacher at Walford primary and Celestine proves that he has learnt from his past mistakes by showing genuine happiness for Etta's success. However, in June of that year Celestine is offered a promotion in Norwich. Etta is unwilling to move but after Lloyd gets into trouble with the police for joy-riding, she decides that a fresh start for the family might be best. So the couple leave Walford for a new start. Celestine returns briefly in July 1993 when he finds out that his daughter is planning on marrying Steve Elliot (Mark Monero) and is extremely shocked to find out that she is pregnant. Celestine is also shocked to meet his previously unknown of niece, Gidea Thompson (Sian Martin), and he is appalled to find out that his father, Jules, had abandoned Gidea's grandmother - who at the time was pregnant with Gidea's mother - many years earlier. Etta returns briefly in February 1994 to stop Steve (Hattie's ex-boyfriend) from attempting to contact her daughter when he arrives in Norwich and the following week she visits Walford to try to persuade her father-in-law, Jules, to come and live with them following his mugging. Jules declines and says he is happy in the square. Creation and development In the latter part of 1989 EastEnders acquired a new executive producer named Michael Ferguson, who took over from Mike Gibbon. Ferguson had previously been a producer on ITV's The Bill — a hard-hitting, gritty and successful police drama, which seemed to be challenging EastEnders in providing a realistic vision of modern life in London. Due to his success on The Bill, Peter Cregeen, the Head of Series at the BBC, poached Ferguson to become executive producer of EastEnders. Following a relatively unsuccessful inclination towards comic storylines throughout 1989, Ferguson decided to take the soap in a new direction in 1990. Big changes were implemented both off- screen and on-screen. Ferguson altered the way the episodes were produced, changed the way the storylines were conceptualised and introduced a far greater amount of location work than had previously been seen. EastEnders scriptwriter Colin Brake has said that it was a challenging period, but \\"the results on-screen were a programme with a new sense of vitality, and a programme more in touch with the real world than it had been for a while\\". As a consequence of these changes, a large number of characters were axed in early 1990 as the new production machine cleared way for a new direction and new characters. Among the new characters were the Jamaican Tavernier family, who collectively arrived on-screen in July 1990, composed of grandfather Jules (Tommy Eytle), his son and daughter-in-law Celestine (Leroy Golding) and Etta (Jacqui Gordon-Lawrence), their eldest son Clyde (Steven Woodcock), and their twins Lloyd (Garey Bridges) and Hattie, played by Michelle Gayle. Colin Brake has described the Taverniers as the major new additions that year, and it heralded the first time that an entire family had joined the serial all at once. Their introduction has also been described as a well-intentioned attempt to portray a wider range of black characters than had previously been achieved on the soap. Etta was Gordon-Lawrence's first television role. Golding, a relatively inexperienced actor at the time of his casting, was sent to audition for the part of Celestine as a means of getting him used to the audition process. He was awarded the part and claims that his inexperience helped rather than hindered the Tavernier family to gel together as it created a sense of \\"camaraderie\\" among them; he suggests that he and his screen wife Gordon-Lawrence \\"played very well off each other\\". The Taverniers backstory scripted them as Trinidadian immigrants, who came to the UK in the 1960s and battled their way through a racist society to achieve. Kingsley describes Etta as \\"the real boss at home, clever enough to let Celestine and Jules believe they were the heads of the household\\" Meanwhile, Celestine has been described \\"as someone so straight and upstanding that he'd have to be given a surgical procedure in order to have an unclean thought.\\" Author Hilary Kingsley suggests that Celestine was the \\"most upright, law-abiding citizen of Albert Square [...] but he doesn't get much thanks for it.\\" She goes on to say that Celestine is \\"not a happy man, though. He knows his father thinks he has lost his roots. His older son Clyde thinks he has 'sold out' and accepted the prejudices of his bosses who've been slow to promote him. His twins wish he'd loosen up and get excited about something other than their school reports and the cricket results.\\" Kingsley suggests that it was Celestine's relationship with Etta that proved most problematic for him however, stating that \\"He loves [Etta] and has always been loyal. but when she decided to push ahead in her career he began to feel slighted.\\" Celestine and Etta's most prominent storylines concerned marital difficulties. Kingsley suggests that Etta's independence and decision to undergo sterilisation and have an abortion, wounded Celestine's male pride and plunged their marriage into turmoil. However, the Taverniers marriage remained intact when \\"Celestine realised he had to change or he'd be the loser\\". Half the Tavernier family, including Celestine, Etta and Lloyd were written out of the serial in 1992. On-screen Celestine was given a promotion in Norwich and left Walford. However, Celestine appeared again in 1993 and Etta in 1994 as part of storylines that were focusing on the remaining characters of the Tavernier family, Jules, Hattie and Clyde.

It was the only split from that organization that created a new group.  Origins  The origin of the group goes back to a resolution Benjamin Gitlow submitted to the Second National Conference of the Lovestone group September 2–3, 1932. He wished that the group would adopt a new resolution on the general line of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. While endorsing the first Five Year Plan, and defending the Soviet Union as a whole, it wished to criticize \\"factional\\" use of the plan for the benefit of the Stalin leadership in the USSR and the Comintern, as well as the mistakes with regard to the collectivization of agriculture and the creation of light industry. While the conference re- adopted its previous spring 1931 resolution on the issue, it opened up the pages of its organ, Workers Age, to debate on the issue and asked its members to contribute their opinions beginning with the November 15 issue.Workers Age Vol. 2 #3 Nov 15, 1932 p.6 Editorials supporting the old resolution were submitted by Jay Lovestone,Workers Age Vol. 2 #4 Dec. 1, 1932 pp.4,7 Will Herberg,Workers Age Vol. 2 #4 Dec. 1, 1932 p.5 Herbert ZamWorkers Age Vol. 2 #5 Dec. 15, 1932 p.4 and others, while an article against the current resolution by Lazar Becker was broken up and published over three issues.\\"Historically inevitable and correct...\\" Workers Age Vol. 2 #5 Dec. 15, 1932 p.5, Workers Age Vol. 2 #6 Jan. 1, 1933 p.4, and Workers Age Vol. 2 #7 Jan. 15, 1933 pp.5,7 Portions of Gitlows own contribution, \\"The Russian Question critically considered\\" were published in two issues, but not the conclusion.Workers Age Vol. 2 #7 Jan. 15, 1933 p.5 Workers Age Vol. 2 #8 Feb. 1, 1933 pp.4,7 The majority argued that the general line of the CPSU was correct, and the opposition was offering \\"constructive criticism\\" of the Stalin leaderships \\"mistakes\\" in its application domestically within the Soviet Union and with regards to the relationship between the CPSU and the other parties in the Comintern. Furthermore, the \\"Russian question\\" was not a defining issue for the group. Gitlow and Becker argued that a correct understanding of the \\"Russian question\\" was of decisive importance to the group and the position taken on it determined whether the group had a justification for being. Gitlow argued that though the CPSUs official line as determined by the 15th congress was correct, the Stalin leadership had veered so far away from it that the Party's general line was no longer correct and was going in the direction of Trotskyism. After the National Bureau of the group upheld its support for the current position on the Russian question at a New York mass meeting on February 2, 1933 Gitlow resigned.Workers Age Vol. 2 #9 Feb. 15, 1933 p.8 At the next plenum of the CPOs National Committee, February 11–13, Becker presented an appeal with the signatures of 13 members which criticized the Lovestone leadership on the \\"Russian question\\" and on a number of other issues related to the groups work within the labor movement and relationship to the official Communist Party. The appeal was rejected unanimously by the National Committee.Workers Age Vol. 2 #10 Mar. 1, 1933 p.6  Activism  After leaving the Lovestoneites, Gitlow tried to form a \\"bloc\\" of the opposition Communist movements against Stalinism.Benjamin Gitlow I confess; the truth about American communism New York, E. P. Dutton 1939. To that end he addressed a letter on April 4 to the Lovestonites, the Trotskyist Communist League of America and Albert Weisbord's Communist League of Struggle outlining his plans for a conference to unite the Communist Opposition groups with the ultimate aim of reconstituting the Communist Party USA on a non- Stalinist basis. He was rebuffed by Weisbord's group, who would only unite with him on the basis of the program of the Left Opposition,Class Struggle Vol. 3 #6 but got a more sympathetic hearing from the Trotskyists. In September he attended a conference sponsored by the League for Independent Political Action that was attempting to build a movement for a Farmer–Labor Party, but nothing came of it.Class Struggle Vol. 3 #9 Gitlow had more luck with the Trotskyist Communist League of America. Unity negotiations with them began in October 1933. While formal unity stalled over questions related to the Fourth International, \\"socialism in one country\\" and the labor party, the two organizations worked together within the Amalgamated Hotel and Restaurant Workers Union, a division of the Amalgamated Food Workers where each had a small following. Negotiations eventually stopped in November as both groups concentrated on building the AFW, preparing for a general strike.Max Shachtman \\"'New Group' for a 'New Party'\\" in The Militant Vol. VII #21 May 26, 1934 p.3 After a strike was canceled shortly before New Year's Eve, a new strike was called in late January after a union member was dismissed from the Waldorf- Astoria Hotel. The Amalgamated, under joint CLA-Gitlowite leadership, led a general strike of at least 4,000 workers in some of New York's most famous hotels, including the Astor, Biltmore and Commodore.The Militant Vol. VII #4 Jan 29, 1934 p.3 On February 15 the case went to the NRA Regional Labor Board and the union was able to get an agreement with the owners that the strikebreakers would be dismissed, the workers could return to their jobs under joint union-management auspices and that the RLB would hold hearings on the conditions in the hotels. While these conditions were violated by the hotel management, the secretary of the union, CLA member B.J. Field considered it a victory and put emphasis on negotiating with the hotels rather than continued pickets. For this, and for alleged clique rule and attempts to curry favor with \\"bourgeoisie public opinion\\" Field and his associate in the union leadership, Aristodimos Kaldis, were expelled from the Communist League of America on February 18.\\"Expulsion of B.J. Field and A. Kaldis\\" in The Militant Vol. VII #11 March 17, 1934 p.2 Field and his coterie fused with the Workers Communist League to form a new group in April 1934, Organization Committee for a Revolutionary Workers Party, despite having had differences with each other while working within the AFW.  Within the Socialist Party  On June 1 the tumultuous 18th national convention of the Socialist Party opened in Detroit. Gitlow and some others from the organizing committee came as observers. Here he came in contact with leaders of the Militants and the Revolutionary Policy Committee. While dismissing the RPC as too factional, he was impressed by the Militants. On August 23 the Gitlow group within the Organizing Committee for a Revolutionary Party announced their intention to join the Socialists. This was not approved by B.J. Field and his adherents, which kept control of the groups paper, Labor Front. The Gitlowites apparently carried on for a few months under the name of the Organizing Committee while attempting to enter the Socialists, and issued leaflets under that name.\\"No comment necessary\\" in Workers Age Vol. 3 #18 Oct 15, 1934 p.7 On October 29 Gitlow held a conference with \\"several founders and former leaders of the Communist party\\" including delegates from Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey. The group adopted a platform noting that lack of unity between socialists and communists had helped Hitler come to power and endorsing the 1934 Statement of Principles that the Socialist Party had adopted at its convention in June as a step toward \\"revolutionary development\\". The group made an application to join the Socialist Party but they were rebuffed by the Socialist Party of New York. The leadership of the SPNY was a stronghold of the moderate Old Guard faction and disapproved of the revolutionaries. State chairman Louis Waldman saw it as an attempt by the Militants to weaken the Old Guard in the state, especially after Norman Thomas endorsed letting them into the party. After the state executive committee passed a resolution strictly prohibiting any local from allowing a communist or quasi-communist from joining, Gitlow joined the New Jersey state organization. One inside the Socialist Party, however, Gitlow started to have doubts about the Militants. The general pro-communist tone of the Militants upset him, especially after they started co-operating with the Communists organizationally during the popular front period. He was dismayed by the merger of the Student League for Industrial Democracy into the American Student Union, and the entry of the CP-affiliated Unemployed Councils into the Workers Alliance of America for fear the new organizations would be controlled by the Communist Party. Instead of leading another split he decided to drop out altogether. Lazar Becker would stay with the party until at least its 1940 convention, when he led the opposition to Norman Thomas' pacifist stance on World War II.

History Building uses Constructed between 1905 and 1907, The building that housed Cooley located at Sedgwick Avenue and Division Street was the original location for Albert G. Lane Manual Training High School (now known as Lane Tech College Prep), a then all boys vocational school which opened the following year. By 1931, Lane's enrollment had soared to 7,000, which caused over-crowding issues within the building. The Chicago Board of Education chose a new site for Lane which opened in 1934. Once Lane moved from the location, The building then housed Washburne Vocational High School (which later became known as Washburne Trade School). Cooley Washburne occupied the building until the neighborhood's population grew to record high numbers. At that time Cabrini-Green, a Chicago Housing Authority public housing complex located around the school population had reached about 15,000 residents. Due to this, It became a need for another public high school in the community to prevent over crowding at nearby Lincoln Park High School (then known as Robert A. Waller High School) and Wells High School. After Washburne was relocated to the south side of the city in January 1958, Chicago Public Schools purposed a new school for the vacant building to the Board of Education. Proposed was a public neighborhood vocational high school with an upper grade center; seventh and eighth grade program. Approved by the Chicago Board of Education, The school opened as Edwin Gilbert Cooley Vocational High School in September 1958 for the 1958–1959 school year. When the school opened, The enrollment was around 1,700; with the student body being made up of 69% White and 41% African–American. By the end of the 1963–1964 school year, the African–American student population at the school had increased while the White population decreased drastically by 78%. The school's student body was predominately African-American with a percentage of 98%, most of whom lived in Cabrini by 1967. During the 1967–1968 school year, Problems began to emerge within the school and Cooley administration and local school council voiced concerns to school board officials about issues with the school's outdated and aged facilities. In November 1968, School board officials proposed a plan to co-locate Cooley with Waller High School; constructing a building on vacant land near the Waller campus. Cooley's administration objected to the proposal, citing the co–location would phase out its current student body who resided at the north–west end of the district; stating a new school should be built near its current location. Members of the Lincoln Park Conservation Association also rejected the proposal, citing differences within Cooley and Waller school communities.Chicago Tribune, High School Land Plea To Be Made, January 24, 1971.Retrieved September 7, 2020.

Zakopane Style (or Witkiewicz Style) is an art style, most visible in architecture, but also found in furniture and related objects, inspired by the regional art of Poland's highland region known as Podhale. Drawing on the motifs and traditions in the buildings of the Carpathian Mountains, this synthesis was created by Stanisław Witkiewicz who was born in the Lithuanian village of Pašiaušė, and is now considered to be one of the core traditions of the Góral people. Development As the Podhale region developed into a tourist area in the mid-19th century, the population of Zakopane began to rise. The new buildings to house these new well-to-do inhabitants was built in the style of Swiss and later Austro-Hungarian chalets. Stanislaw Witkiewicz, an art critic, architect, painter, novelist and journalist, was chosen to design a villa for Zygmunt Gnatowski.Zakopane Style Museum In his plans, Witkiewicz decided against using these foreign building styles and instead chose to utilize the local traditions used by the native Górals of Podhale.The Museum of the Zakopane Style Drawing on the Vernacular architecture of the Carpathians, Witkiewicz used as a model the modest but richly decorated homes in Góral villages such as Chochołów which he further enriched by incorporating select elements of Art Nouveau style, thus giving birth to the \\"Zakopane Style\\". This building, known as the Villa \\"Koliba\\" was built between 1892 and 1894, and it still stands to this day on Koscieliska Street in the mountain resort of Zakopane. Witkiewicz designed a number of original buildings in Zakopane, including the \\"Dom pod Jedlami\\" in the Koziniec district, the chapel in the Jaszczurowka district, Villa \\"Oksza\\" on Zamojski Street, the building of the Tatra Museum, the chapel of St. John the Baptist in the parish Church of the Holy Family on Krupówki Street, and the Korniłowicz family chapel in the Bystre district. Stanislaw Witkiewicz once wrote on the idea of the Zakopane style: The Zakopane style soon found proponents among other outstanding architects, including Jan Witkiewicz- Koszyc, Wladyslaw Matlakowski, and Walery Eliasz-Radzikowski. Outside the Polish highlands Żeromski's Chata, in Nałęczów. The Zakopane style also gained popularity beyond the Polish highlands. In the Warsaw area, attempts were made to adapt the style to brick construction. Examples include Czeslaw Domaniewski's design for a series of train stations and the design for a townhouse located at 30 Chmielna Street in the center of Warsaw. In 1900, the young Kraków-based architect Franciszek Mączyński won an international architectural competition organized by the Paris-based magazine \\"Moniteur des Architectes\\" with a design of a villa in the Zakopane style. There was also the Chata built for author Stefan Żeromski in Nałęczów, a series of villas in Wisła as well as in Konstancin and Anin and a brick tenement by Jan Starowicz dubbed \\"Beneath the Góral\\" in Łódź, Kamienica pod Góralem jak nowa – Wieści – MM Moje Miasto.

Additionally, the Góral diaspora has incorporated the norms and designs of the Zakopane Style of Architecture into homes, chapels and community buildings that serve their community, such as the Polish Highlanders Alliance of North America in Chicago, or the chapel on the grounds of the Polish National Alliance's Youth Camp in Yorkville. Today Model of Villa pod Jedlami by Stanisław Witkiewicz The Zakopane style dominated architecture in the Podhale region for many years. Although the cutoff date for buildings designed in the Zakopane Style of Architecture is usually held to be 1914, many new pensions, villas and highlander homes are built according to the architectural model devised by Witkiewicz to the present day. The museum of the Zakopane Style of Architecture located in the Villa \\"Koliba\\" first designed by Witkiewicz provides visitors with information on the Zakopane style.

February 12, 895Academia Sinica Chinese-Western Calendar Converter.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 260.) was a warlord late in the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty who was known for his successive rules of Shanguo Circuit (陝虢, headquartered in modern Sanmenxia, Henan) and Huguo Circuit (護國, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi) as military governor (Jiedushi).  Background  It is not known when Wang Chongying was born, and the official histories differ as to where his family was from — according to the Old Book of Tang, Hezhong Municipality (河中, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi),Old Book of Tang, vol. 182. and according to the New Book of Tang, Taiyuan Municipality.New Book of Tang, vol. 187. His father Wang Zong () was a successful military officer who reached the position of prefect of Yan Prefecture (鹽州, in modern Yulin, Shaanxi). Because of his father's contributions, both Wang Chongying and his younger brother Wang Chongrong served in the military as well, and both were known for their fierce fighting ability. Wang Chongying had at least one other brother, Wang Chongjian (), who was older than Wang Chongrong and Wang Chongying.The Recout Monument of Wang Zong the Late Defender of Yan Prefect  Early career  At one point, Wang Chongying served as the prefect of Fen Prefecture (汾州, in modern Linfen, Shanxi). By 882 — by which point Wang Chongrong had taken over Hezhong Circuit (河中, headquartered at Hezhong Municipality) as its military governor and by which time the imperial capital Chang'an had fallen to the major agrarian rebel Huang Chao, forcing then- reigning Emperor Xizong to flee to Chengdu — Wang Chongying was serving as the governor (觀察使, Guanchashi) of Shanguo Circuit. That year, when Emperor Xizong put the chancellor Wang Duo in command of the operations against Huang (who had declared himself emperor of a new state of Qi), Wang Chongying was put in charge of supplying Wang Duo's army.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 254. After Tang forces defeated Qi forces in 883 and forced Huang to abandon Chang'an, Shanguo was made into a circuit that had a military governor, and Wang Chongying was made its military governor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 255. In 885, Emperor Xizong bestowed the honorary chancellor designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi () on him.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 256.  At Huguo Circuit  By 887, Wang Chongrong had grown harsh in his governance of Hezhong CircuitZizhi Tongjian, vol. 257. — which by that point had been renamed Huguo Circuit. When he humiliated the officer Chang Xingru (), Chang started a mutiny and killed him. Chang then requested that Wang Chongying succeed Wang Chongrong, a request that Emperor Xizong granted. Emperor Xizong also made Wang Chongying's son Wang Gong the acting military governor of Shanguo. After Wang Chongying arrived in Huguo and took office, he arrested Chang and put Chang to death. In 888, faced with the repeated pillaging by Li Hanzhi the military governor of Heyang Circuit (河陽, headquartered in modern Jiaozuo, Henan), Wang Chongying persuaded Li's ally Zhang Quanyi the mayor of Henan Municipality (河南, i.e., the Luoyang region) to turn against Li; Zhang ambushed Li's headquarters at Heyang Circuit's capital Heyang successfully, forcing Li to flee, and thereafter took over the circuit. In 891, Emperor Xizong's brother and successor Emperor Zhaozong bestowed the greater honorary chancellor title of Zhongshu Ling () on Wang Chongying.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 258. Wang Chongying died in 895. The soldiers supported Wang Chongrong's adoptive son Wang Ke — who was the biological son of Wang Chongjian's and therefore biological nephew to both Wang Chongrong and Wang Chongying — to succeed him, but Wang Gong, who had by that point become military governor of Shanguo, which had been renamed Baoyi (), also wished to have Huguo, leading to a succession struggle between them. Emperor Zhaozong, with Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), who was also Wang Ke's father- in-law, backing Wang Ke's claim, made Wang Ke military governor of Huguo.

It was one of the leading venues for the Romanian science fiction genre under the communist regime. The first series was published between October 1, 1955 and April 1974; the review was reestablished in 1990, after the 1989 Revolution, originally as a common venture with the Anticipația almanac (itself in print from 1982 to 1999). In 2012 - 2015 was published as a standalone magazine by Editura Nemira.Anticipația CPSF at nemira.ro History Colecția... was established following a nationwide competition for \\"the best science fiction story\\", aimed at young Romanian writers. Launched by Știință și Tehnică, it had among its winners Adrian Rogoz, who was subsequently asked to take over as editor of the bi-monthly collection.Mike Ashley, Gateways to Forever: the Story of the Science-fiction Magazines from 1970 to 1980, Liverpool University Press, Liverpool, 2007, p.409. As a result, Romania was the first and for long only Eastern European (Eastern Bloc) country to have a specialized science fiction publication. The collection published 466 consecutive issues, generally structured around a long, serialized, story and a shorter one. Beginning in the 1960s, it spearheaded the science fiction club phenomenon, promoted by Rogoz and fellow writer Ion Hobana. The collection itself was deemed \\"extraordinary popular\\" by author Mihai Iovănel, in a 2008 article for Gândul; however, Iovănel also argued that, through the early contributions of various writers (Radu Nor, I. M. Ştefan etc.), CPSF was a mild propaganda outlet for Marxism-Leninism and the Soviet Union (see Russian science fiction and fantasy, Soviet occupation of Romania, Socialist realism in Romania). Mihai Iovănel, \\"Pe fundația SF-ului românesc este stanțat logo-ul URSS\\", in Gândul, February 16, 2008 The same writer notes that Romanian science fiction in general and Colecţia... in particular only emancipated themselves from such pressures late in the 1960s, partly through the science fantasy works of Rogoz, Vladimir Colin, Sergiu Fărcăşan and several others. Relaunched in 1990 by author Mihai Dan Pavelescu, Colecția... merged with Anticipaţia and was for a while known as CPSF Anticipația. Pavelescu quit his position by the end of the decade, and the magazine, again restructured, experienced changes in direction, financial difficulties, and, allegedly, controversy over who owned its trademark. Michael Hăulică, \\"...azi o vedem și nu e!\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 334, August 2006 Writer Aurel Cărășel eventually took over as Colecţia... editor and moved its headquarters from Bucharest to Craiova, but, according to science fiction reviewer Michael Hăulică, there was little connection between the two series, Cărăşel's being unremarkable.

Most of them live in Johannesburg and other major cities. According to the 2011 census, Asians account for 2.5% of South Africa's total population. While the Indian, Chinese, and Vietnamese South African populations are relatively large, the number of Japanese is small and largely focused in Johannesburg and Cape Town. History Japanese immigration to South Africa began when Japan emerged as the country's largest trading partner when it was under apartheid.  Pre- Apartheid  The 1913 \\"Admission of Persons to the Union Regulation Act no. 22\\" presented an early obstacle to trade relations between South Africa and Japan. This immigration act banned all Asians, including Japanese, as \\"prohibited immigrants.\\" Daniel François Malan argued that Japan was vitally important to South Africa as a long-term ally to combat the influence of communism. In 1930 he successfully persuaded the government to exclude Japanese from the \\"prohibited immigrants\\" category on this basis. He subsequently successfully lobbied to exclude Japanese from the decision of the Select Committee on the Liquor Bill which prohibited Asians from drinking in the Union, stating that the Japanese are \\"our friends.\\" On December 8, 1941, the South African government declared war with Japan following the attack on Pearl Harbor. D. F. Malan defended Japanese expansion, declaring Soviet communism as the real threat. He continued to support pro-Japan economic policies through his political career.  Apartheid: 1948 - 1994  As the Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa from 1948 until 1954, D. F. Malan laid the foundations for apartheid by implementing segregationist policy. He also strengthened trade relations between Japan and South Africa after WWII due to Japan's need for industrial raw materials. Hendrik Verwoerd served as the prime minister of the Union of South Africa until 1961 and prime minister of the Republic of South Africa until 1966. The establishment of a democratic government in 1961 was accompanied by the establishment of the Johannesburg branch of JETRO, the Japanese External Trade Organization.https://www.za.emb- japan.go.jp/en/Japan_SA/japanese_prospectus2014.pdf However, full diplomatic relations were not established until 1992. In the early 1960s, Tokyo's Yawata Iron & Steel Co. announced a possible $250 million industrial contract. Over the next ten years, Yawata Iron & Steel Co. would purchase 5,000,000 tons of pig iron from South Africa. To avoid insulting Japanese trade delegations that would begin making regular visits to South Africa, Verwoerd pushed Pretoria's Group Areas Board to award Japanese the status of \\"honorary whites.\\" Due to inconsistencies with the apartheid, opposition party politicians and the press since the early 1960s questioned why Japanese were granted special privileges.Afro-Hispanic Review: White, Honorary White, or Non-White: Apartheid Era Constructions of Chinese, Dr. Yoon Jung Park (Univ of Johannesburg), Spring 2008 The designation gave the Japanese nearly all the same rights and privileges as whites, excepting the right to vote and conscription. Immigration from Japan declined due to Japan's economic downturn when apartheid ended. In 1989, Japan introduced GGP (Grant assistance for Grassroots human security Projects). The stated goal was to fund relatively small development projects initiated by nonprofit organizations which address the well-being of disadvantaged communities. Between 1990 and 2016, this program would provide $438 million ZAR to 612 different projects.  Post- Apartheid  Japan's aid goals toward South Africa have grown in recent years. Toward the end of apartheid, Japan launched TICAD (Tokyo International Conference on African Development) to provide assistance to African countries. To date, six conferences have been held. At TICAD V in June 2013, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged $14 billion in Official Development Assistance (ODA) to Africa over the next five years. Japan and South Africa also have growing economic relations. In 2013, Japan was South Africa's 3rd largest export destination and 6th largest import source Education There is one Japanese international school in South Africa, the Japanese School of Johannesburg.

Satyagnana Sabha (சத்ய ஞான சபை, Temple of Wisdom) is a temple constructed by the Saivite saint Sri Raamalinga Swaamigal (Vallalaar) in the town of Vadalur in Cuddalore district,Tamil Nadu Guide, Pg 53Tamil Nadu Guide, Pg 66 Tamil Nadu, India. It is an octagonal structure; the sanctum sanctorum of this temple is concealed from the main hall by seven curtains which are parted only on the Thai Poosam day. All the four towers of the Chidambaram Nataraajar temple are visible from the sabha. The Sathya gnana sabha consists of three sabhas: * the Chirchabai (சிற்சபை) which represents moon or left eye of people, * the Porchabai (பொற்சபை) or golden sabha which represents the sun or right eye of people and * the third Gnana sabha (ஞான சபை) which represents the third eye or the wisdom of people. The building was built in an octagonal shape which represents the 8 bones in the human skull. Only two Saints established Sangha (sabha) in Indian and World history. One is Gautama Buddha, another is Saint Vallalar. All Saivite madams are primarily for religious pupils, to which common people only go when a need arises. But a Sabha is a place where common people can go, join, organize and they can interact with spiritual people. Vallalar clearly mentioned this in his poetry as given below: :\\"எச்சபை பொதுவென இயம்பினர் அறிஞர்கள் :அச்சபை யிடங்கொள்ளும் அருட்பெருஞ் ஜோதி\\" :meaning, \\"This sabha is a common place for every one, who follows San maargam (good way)\\". Near the Sathya gnana sabha there is the Dharma saalai where free food is offered to thousands of people every day. The Dharma saalai has a stove which was lighted by Sri Raamalinga swaamigal (Vallalar), which is still being used for cooking. Near the Dharma saalai, there is the jeeva samaadhi of Kalpattu ayyaa. He was the second san maargi attaining dheekshai from vallalar.

Dummett (1940–2002) was a South African mineral-exploration geologist who is best known for his role in the discovery of the Ekati Diamond Mine in the Barren Lands of Canada's Northwest Territories. Dummett has been described as \\"the brains, the ideas and the energy\\" behind the discovery of Ekati, which led to the creation of a new Canadian diamond-mining industry. Career Dummett earned his BSc degree at the University of the Witwatersrand in 1964, and moved to Canada in 1965. In 1970, he entered the University of Queensland for graduate work. In 1977, Dummett signed on with Superior Oil to prospect for diamonds in North America, just as the science of using indicator minerals -- pyrope garnets, chrome diopside and chromite—for diamond exploration was being worked out. Superior formed a joint venture with Falconbridge Ltd., and the joint venture hired geologist Charles Fipke for the diamond exploration project. Early in the program, Dummett tried to convince Governor Bill Clinton to lease Arkansas's Crater of Diamonds State Park.Kevin Krajick, Barren Lands: An Epic Search for Diamonds in the North American Arctic. 2001, Freeman/Henry Holt, Between 1979 and 1982, the partners found at least 20 kimberlite pipes, but none had commercial diamond potential. The Falconbridge-Superior joint venture then funded a research program by South African geochemist John Gurney, to study possible indicator minerals for diamondiferous pipes. By 1982, Gurney had established that the kimberlite pyrope garnet \\"G10\\" was critical to diamond discovery. Pipes without the G10 garnet were likely to be barren. Using this new technology, the venture discovered a promising pipe in eastern Botswana, but lost the land to De Beers, who later discovered a commercial diamond deposit there. Mobil Oil then bought Superior, and ended its mineral exploration program in 1987. Dummett convinced Mobil to turn over its data to Fipke so the exploration effort could continue. Fipke and his partner Stewart Blusson, working on a \\"shoestring,\\" staked some promising ground near Lac de Gras in 1989. Dummett took a new job with BHP Minerals in 1989, and convinced his new employer to lease their property. In 1991, BHP drilling on their leased claims found micro-diamonds, sparking one of largest claimstaking rushes in mining history. Under Dummet's direction, BHP eventually developed commercial diamond reserves in five pipes; the discovery pipe turned out to be non-commercial. BHP began the permitting process for the Ekati Diamond Mine in 1995, received final approval in 1997, and opened the mine late in 1998. Ekati Diamond Mine history at BHP Billiton By 2009, annual sales from EKATI amounted to about 5% by value of world diamond production.Ekati Diamond Mine at BHP Billiton In 2001, Dummett joined Ivanhoe Mines as Vice President.

It is based on the Yuan dynasty play The Orphan of Zhao by Ji Junxiang. It was distributed in the United States by Samuel Goldwyn Films. Plot The story is set in Jin, a ducal state under the Zhou dynasty, during the Spring and Autumn period in ancient China. Zhao Dun, the chancellor of Jin, and his son, General Zhao Shuo, have a feud with General Tu'an Gu. Tu'an Gu secretly murders the Duke of Jin and pushes the blame to the Zhao family, using that as an excuse to massacre the Zhao family. The sole survivor is Zhao Shuo's baby son, Zhao Wu, whose mother is the Duke's elder sister, Lady Zhuang. Lady Zhuang pleads with Tu'an Gu's subordinate, Han Jue, to spare her child. She then instructs Cheng Ying, a physician, to bring the child to Gongsun Chujiu, a friend of the Zhao family, before committing suicide. When Tu'an Gu learns that the orphan had escaped, he slashes his sword at Han Jue's face in anger and disfigures him. Tu'an Gu then issues an order to seal the gates and to gather all newborn babies in the city. The plan was to identify the Zhao orphan since Tu'an Gu was counting on the person hiding the baby to not hand over the baby to him, hence singling out the one baby left in the city to be the Zhao infant. Cheng Ying brings the baby Zhao Wu home, but his wife gives the child to the searching soldiers. Cheng Ying then asks Gongsun Chujiu to bring his wife and his real son (disguised as Zhao Wu) out of the city, while he stays behind to try and retrieve Zhao Wu from Tu'an Gu. Tu'an Gu finds Cheng Ying suspicious, but Cheng lies that the Zhao orphan has been taken out of the city by Gongsun Chujiu. Tu'an Gu then leads his soldiers to Gongsun Chujiu's house and finds Cheng Ying's wife and son. Mistaking Cheng Ying's son for the Zhao orphan, Tu'an Gu kills the infant, Gongsun Chujiu and Cheng's wife. Cheng Ying is devastated by the loss of his family and he swears vengeance on Tu'an Gu. He pretends to pledge allegiance to Tu'an Gu and brings Zhao Wu along with him and raises the child in Tu'an's house. Tu'an Gu mistakenly believes that Zhao Wu is Cheng Ying's son and adopts Zhao Wu as his godson. Zhao Wu gradually grows up under Tu'an Gu's tutelage and develops a close bond with Tu'an. Cheng Ying also forges a close friendship with the disfigured Han Jue and they secretly plot to help Zhao Wu avenge his family. One day, Cheng Ying breaks the truth to Zhao Wu, telling him that Tu'an Gu, who has been a fatherly figure to him for the past 15 years, is actually the murderer of his family. Zhao Wu is unable to accept the truth initially but his attitude changes as he hears from Han Jue about how Cheng Ying sacrificed his own son to save him. Zhao Wu and Cheng Ying finally confront Tu'an Gu, but Tu'an is aware of Zhao's true identity, because, over the years, he has noticed that the boy resembles Zhao Shuo. Zhao Wu engages Tu'an Gu in a sword fight but is no match for the latter. At the critical moment, Cheng Ying sacrifices himself to give Zhao Wu an opportunity to stab and kill Tu'an Gu. The film ends with a dying Cheng Ying having a vision of his reunion with his family.

It is located at 308 Edward Street on the southern corner with Ann Street, diagonally opposite to Brisbane's Central Railway Station. It was designed by Colonel Saunders and built from 1910 to 1911. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992. History Commandant Herbert Booth of the Salvation Army first proposed a People's Palace for Brisbane in July 1899, following the success of the People's Palace in Sydney. However, the original vision was for intended as a refuge or shelter accommodation. The People's Palace was built in 1910–1911 by the Salvation Army as a temperance hotel to provide inexpensive \\"working class\\" accommodation for travellers. It was designed by the Lieutenant-Colonel Saunders, the Salvation Army's architect and secretary for property affairs. It was situated across the road from the Temperance Hall operated by the Brisbane Total Abstinence Society. The People's Palace comprised three floors of accommodation with 130 rooms, a service basement and a rooftop garden. Construction commenced in March 1910 under Saunders' personal supervision. The concept of temperance hotels grew out of the temperance movement and the Peoples Palace was the first of its type in Queensland. No alcohol, gambling or \\"other evils\\" were permitted on the premises. Although not quite complete, the hotel was decorated with bright flags and hangings to celebrate Coronation Day (22 June 1911), the coronation of King George V. The hotel was officially opened on 27 June 1911. It was under the control of Major Wilson assisted by Ensign John McLean. It was popular with travellers to Brisbane due to its convenient location to the Brisbane's Central railway station. The building also was the Queensland headquarters for the Social Wing of the Salvation Army. In 1913 extensions were undertaken which involved adding an extra two storeys. This created a building of such height that special fire safety measured were imposed. Despite this, many years later, to meet modern fire standards, a set of brick fire stairs had to be added. In 1929, the Canberra Temperance Hotel operated by the Queensland Prohibition League (later the Queensland Temperance League) opened on the site of the old Temperance Hall. In the early morning of Thursday 20 January 1938, an electrical wire started a fire and burned out the upper storey. Fortunately the damage was covered by insurance. Renovations and internal re-arrangements continued over the decades as uses and priorities changed. The building operated as a temperance hotel until 1979. After that, it was leased out as budget accommodation, used as Salvation Army offices and most recently operated as a backpacker hostel. Recently, the Salvation Army has established its headquarters on the site and the building is now primarily used as offices. Description The People's Palace after the addition of 2 more floors, circa 1913 This large Federation style building is a predominantly red brick structure with painted cement rendered trimmings, decorative cast iron work, and a corner tower. The plan form is that of a hollow rectangle, with the central opening providing light and air to the rooms. It comprises five storeys plus a basement, and additions above the roof line, it has continuous verandahs on three levels, while the fourth has a steeply pitched roof with red tiles in a diamond pattern punctuated by dormer windows. The roof level comprises a steeply pitched roof with red tiles arranged in a diamond pattern and dormer windows. The corner octagonal tower, marking the main entrance, has a bell-shaped roof with small dormers in each roof segment. Adjacent to the tower is a polygonal brick lift tower. The verandah's feature decorative cast iron balustrades and friezes with timber posts and handrails. The semi-circular arched and circular windows to the tower have cream painted cement render dressings to contrast with the red brick. Dining room, 1911 Internally the rectangular courtyard has been divided into two by the insertion of a modern brick fire stair. The hipped roof with clerestory remains above the basement dining saloon in the northern courtyard. This is now used as office space but its original entry doors remain. Pressed metal ceilings remain in many sections of the building. The upper levels have not been refurbished, but the partitioning of the lower levels is not original. The original lift with its sliding doors, timber panelling and surrounding stairwell remains beside the entry foyer. Its very distinctive appearance derives from the extensive use of decorative cast iron work for the balustrades of its verandahs and from the contrast of the cream-coloured render against the red brick on the upper part of the tower. Being situated on a hill on a busy intersection, it is one of Brisbane's most recognisable buildings.

Each sister received double life sentences, This sentence has been criticized as too severe by a number of civil rights activists and prominent commentators on the grounds that the sisters had no previous criminal record and the robbery netted no more than eleven dollars. Their convictions were upheld by the Mississippi Court of Appeals in 1996. The U.S. Supreme Court denied both their petition for appeal in 1997 and an appeal to vacate the conviction in 1998. Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour denied a petition for clemency in 2006. On December 29, 2010, Governor Barbour suspended their sentence on the condition that Gladys donate a kidney to her ailing sister, who was suffering kidney failure and required dialysis. The two women were released from prison on January 7, 2011. They moved to Pensacola, Florida. It is anticipated that they will remain on parole and pay a supervision fee to the state of Florida for the rest of their lives. Early life Jamie Scott was born in 1972; her younger sister was born in 1974. Their mother was Evelyn Rasco. They attended local schools. Jamie has a son, Richard, born before she went to prison. Trial, incarceration, and appeals The sisters were charged with orchestrating a 1993 armed robbery in Forest, Mississippi. According to court testimony, the sisters convinced three male teens to assist them in an armed robbery. At a local mini mart, the sisters persuaded two men to drive them to a nearby nightclub and had their accomplices follow them. During the car trip, Jamie Scott complained of nausea. While the car was pulled over, the three teenagers exited the car behind them and robbed the two victims at gunpoint. During this robbery, it was claimed that one of the sisters held the shotgun. The victims testified that both sisters left with the three teenagers. Neither sister testified at the trial, and no one testified in support of their case. When the crime was committed, Jamie was twenty-one years old and Gladys was nineteen years old. The sisters have denied their involvement in the armed robbery. They claim they were implicated as part of a plea deal by the teenagers, who pleaded guilty to the crime. Published estimates of the take from the robbery range from $11 to $200.\\"Scott sisters' mom plans Florida homecoming\\", Clarion Ledger, 31 December 2010 Confessed accomplice Howard Patrick, who was 14 at the time of the robbery, has testified that he was threatened by authorities that, if he did not agree to a plea bargain, he would be sent to a notoriously violent prison where he would likely be raped. Each of the sisters was sentenced to a double life prison sentence. The three males received sentences of eight years and were released after serving two years. The attorney who represented the sisters at their trial was disbarred two years later for matters unrelated to the Scotts' case. The Supreme Court of Mississippi cited the attorney's \\"lack of diligence\\" and \\"failure to communicate with clients\\" in that unrelated case. The sisters have made no claim, however, that the attorney failed to provide them adequate representation in their defense. An affidavit stating that the Scott sisters were not involved in the robbery was signed in 1998 by one of the men who pleaded guilty to the crime, and submitted to the governor as part of a request for clemency. The sisters' conviction was upheld by the Mississippi Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court denied their petition for certiorari; the lower courts' decisions will therefore stand. Mississippi Governor Barbour denied their earlier petition for clemency after the Parole Board recommended against pardon or commutation of sentence. Dan Turner, a spokesman for Barbour, stated the governor has been \\"very consistent in not substituting his judgment of guilt or innocence over the court\\" in pardoning criminals in the past. Suspension of sentence Barbour granted clemency on December 29, 2010, stating The governor's actions led to a heated public debate about the bioethics of a making an organ donation a condition for release. Responses to the Scott sisters' case In the 21st century, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) called for the sisters' release. Benjamin Jealous, president of the NAACP, made a forceful statement: \\"It makes you sick to think that this sort of thing can happen. That these women should be kept in prison until they die – well, that's just so utterly inhumane.\\" While not asserting their innocence, Jealous asked Governor Barbour to pardon the women. Ken Turner, a prosecutor who originally tried their case, stated in September 2010 that although he believes the sisters were guilty of the crime and involved in the robbery, it would be \\"appropriate\\" for their sentences to be commuted. New York Times opinion columnist Bob Herbert wrote that the sisters should be released. He opined that evidence used to convict the sisters was \\"inconclusive\\" and that their sentences were unusually severe. Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Leonard Pitts wrote: \\"Mississippi stands guilty of a grievous offense against simple decency...\\" He went on to say \\"...Whatever the proximate cause of this ridiculous sentence, the larger cause is neon clear: the Scott sisters are black women in the poorest state in the union.\\" The article did not assert their innocence nor guilt of the crime. Life after release Because Jamie was morbidly obese when released from prison, she was found to be not fit to receive a transplant. She tried to lose the necessary weight and thanks to surgery, was able to shed 61 pounds by 2018. The two sisters had moved to Pensacola, Florida after their releases, to care for their mother, who died in 2013. While driving in April 2017, Jamie's car was hit by a drunk driver. After seven unsuccessful surgeries, she lost her right foot the next month, and parole restrictions have reportedly hampered her from receiving necessary medical treatment.Still fighting: Scott sisters find new life in Pensacola after prison, heartbreak, Pensacola News Journal, Melissa Nelson Gabriel, July 23, 2018; retrieved February 16, 2020.

Beginnings The line traces its history back to 1845, when Greenville, South Carolina-area leaders Benjamin Perry, Waddy Thompson Jr., John T. Coleman and Joel Poinsett called a public meeting, this one presided over by Vardry McBee. The goal was to create enthusiasm and collect subscriptions for a rail line to the northern and southern parts of the state. With a committee of 30 potential subscribers, they agreed to seek a preliminary charter for a Greenville and Columbia Railroad, with the understanding that they raise at least $300,000 in subscriptions within a year.Columbia Railroad had Checkered Start, Greenville News, March 23, 2005 Greenville and Columbia Railroad Company stock certificate, 1875.Unsuccessful, the group renewed their charter the following year. The plan was to build a 109-mile line up the east side of the Saluda River through Newberry, South Carolina, and Laurens, South Carolina, to Greenville. The 30 commissioners sought subscribers from Columbia, South Carolina, and all the surrounding counties. They were successful but when stockholders met in May 1847 in Columbia, those from the capital city and from the Abbeville and Anderson districts, urged by local property owner and famed politician John C. Calhoun, who wanted a different route, voted to build a 147-mile line on the west side of the river with its terminus in Anderson.Columbia Railroad had Checkered Start, Greenville News, March 23, 2005 Greenville stockholders, and especially McBee, the largest single subscriber, cried foul. They wanted their money back, but the majority stockholders refused. So the Greenville contingent chartered the Greenville Railroad Co. and threatened to build a railroad from \\"Dr. Brown's place,\\" near modern-day Belton, South Carolina, directly to Greenville, to shift freight and passengers away from Anderson.Columbia Railroad had Checkered Start, Greenville News, March 23, 2005 McBee also put up $50,000 of his own money to make the subscription possible. The other stockholders reluctantly agreed. McBee's hand-picked candidate, John Belton O'Neall, was elected president of the line. Construction McBee played an instrumental role in the development of the line. His son, Pinkney, a civil engineer, surveyed the line. His sawmill provided the timbers and he coaxed iron from distributors. He even quarried stone from his quarry for the foundation of the Greenville freight terminal.Columbia Railroad had Checkered Start, Greenville News, March 23, 2005 By August 1852, the line had been completed to Greenwood. Despite a flash flood that washed out bridges, embankments and tracks along the Broad River, the line went forward. By late November 1853 the tracks were laid to within three miles of Greenville. The coming of the Greenville and Columbia Railroad meant that a traveler could go from Greenville to Columbia in less than 11 hours and on to Charleston by the following day. It was a remarkable improvement considering the journey had previously taken two weeks. Civil War The railroad was Greenville's lifeline to the rest of the state during the Civil War, but when Sherman's troops invaded Columbia, federal troops burned the carrier's offices and depot there. In addition, 12 miles of track ripped up, five bridges vanished and several locomotives were destroyed. After January 1865, it did not operate. A year later, another flood wiped out 40 more miles of track. The Greenville and Columbia Railroad did not restart operations until September 1866.Columbia Railroad had Checkered Start, Greenville News, March 23, 2005 Reconstruction Almost immediately after the line began operations again, the federal government seized it without reimbursing stockholders. Henry Hammett, one of the few solvent Greenvillians after the war, became president in 1868, but then the Greenville and Columbia fell into the hands of the Railroad Ring, politically connected embezzlers who bilked the state out of its lien and mortgage on the rail line. While the carrier did manage to acquire the Union & Spartanburg Railroad around 1870, extending this line from Alston to Spartanburg, in 1872, the railroad declared bankruptcy.Columbia Railroad had Checkered Start, Greenville News, March 23, 2005 At one point in the 1870s, a quarter of the state's revenues were lost in a single fiscal year after a failed investment in the troubled railroad.Journal of Public Budgeting, Accounting & Financial Management, Public Sector Investment Failures, Fall 2006 As a result of the failed investment, the state adopted a constitutional ban on investing public money in stocks, a ban that stood for more than 120 years.

While 2,851 or 13.60% are urban inhabitants, a further 59 individuals are pastoralists. A total of 3,996 households were counted in this woreda, which results in an average of 5.2 persons to a household, and 3,846 housing units. The majority of the inhabitants said they were Protestant, with 92.82% of the population reporting they observed this belief, while 3.22% practiced traditional religions, 1.89% were Catholic, and 1.58% of the population practised Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity.Census 2007 Tables: Gambela Region, Tables 2.1, 2.4, 2.5, 3.1, 3.2 and 3.4.

The presiding deity Vriddhagiriswarar is revered in Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the nayanmars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam. The temple gives its name to the town of Vriddhachalam. Legend Virudhagiriswarar temple first precinct As per Hindu Mythology, when Brahma thought of creating the earth, he created water. Lord Vishnu happened to cut down the evil Madhukaidavas. The cut pieces of the bodies floated on water created by Lord Brahma. On seeing that Brahma prayed to Lord Shiva to create the earth out of the hardened compound from the water and the flesh of the bodies. Lord Shiva appeared as a mountain. Lord Brahma who did not know this created many different mountains. As they did not have space to exist, he was sorrowful. The Pranava God appeared and conveyed Lord Brahma the truth through gestures. Brahma worshipped Lord Shiva who was the form of mountain. Lord Shiva created the earth combining the flesh and the water compounded in a hardened form. He called it medhini. He gave space for the mountains of Brahma. He told Brahma that he was not different from the mountain. The mountains of Brahma came into being after that mountain. Hence the mountain of Shiva was named Pazha malai (old mountain). According to him, that Pazhamalai would be hard pressed on the earth appearing as Shiva Linga above. Those who worshipped it would get all they wished for. Thus, the oldest of all mountains is invisible, but the top layer of it is said to appear in the river-bed of Cuddalore at Vayalur, about four km north of Virudhachalam. Etymology Vriddha means ancient – Achalam the hill. Virudhachalam means an ancient hill. In chaste Tamil this is mentioned as Mudhu Kundram in Thevaram hymns. During the days of Saivite Saints Appar, Gnanasambandhar and Sundarar, the place was known as Pazhamalai in Tamil and changed to the Sanskrit version Virudhachalam in the days that followed. Those praised the temple Vibasithu Sage Vibasithu paid the labours with Vanni leaves. He had a dip in the Manimuthar river and undertook the renovation of this temple. He gave the workers the leaves of the Vanni tree which later changed into coins to the value due to the workers based on the quantum and quality of his work, is a story believed by generations of devotees. The Vanni tree is 1700-year- old, say researchers. The construction of the temple, by itself, has an interesting legend. Vibasithu Munivar, it is said, happened to find the earring that belonged to Lord Kubera's daughter. The jewel, dear to her, was dropped on the lap of Vibhasithu, by a bird. Kubera's daughter announced a reward of all her remaining Jewellery in return for her earring. Vibhasithu gave the earring and with the reward he constructed the temple. Sundarar Pillared hall in the second precinct It is one of the shrines of the 275 Paadal Petra Sthalams. Saint Sundarar was on a fund-raising mission to feed the devotees on the Panguni Uthiram festival in Tiruvarur. Sundarar passed through this place without singing the glory of the Lord. He was stopped by the Lord and made him sing. Then, Lord of this temple donated 12,000 gold coins to Sundararar. Beware of robbers on the way, he placed all the coins in the Manimuthar River and collected it in the tank in Tiruvarur. This is a strange precaution. Money placed in a river cannot be collected from a tank that has no link with each other. But this miracle happened. Thus, came the proverb, “losing in the river and searching in the tank”. Sundarar wanted to test the touch of the gold he took from the tank in Tiruvarur. Lord proved the quality of the gold with Lord Vinayaka as a witness who confirmed the touch. Hence, Vinayaka in the inner prakara of the temple is praised as Mattru-touch, Uraitha-confirmed, Vinayaka- Mattru Uraitha Vinayaka. Significance of Number Five Number five has a significance in this temple. Murthis are five – Lords Vinayaka, Muruga, Shiva, Shakthi and Chandikeswara. Lord is praised by five names – Virudhagireeshwarar, Pazhamalai Nathar, Vruddhachaleswarar, Mudhu Kundreeswarar and Vruddhagiri. There are five Vinayakas in the temple – Aazhathu Vinayakar, Mattru Uraitha Vinayaka, Muppillayar, Dasabhuja Ganapathy and Vallabha Ganapathi. Five Rishis had the darshan of Lord – Romesa, Vibasiddhu, Kumaradeva, Nada Sharma and Anavardhini. There five towers in the temple at east, west, south, north and Kandarathithan (a Chola king) gopuram. There are five prakaras – called Thiruchutru in Tamil They are Kailaya, Vanniyadi, 63 Nayanmar Chuttru and Panchavarna Chuttru. There are five Kodimarams - flag post with five Nandhis – Indra Nandhi, Vedha Nandhi, Athma Nandhi, Maalvidai Nandhi and Dharma Nandhi. There are five inner Mandaps – Artha, Idaikazhi, Thapana, Maha and Isai Mandapams. Outer Mandapams are 20 pillar mandapam, Deeparadhana, 100 pillar mandapam, Vipachithu and Chitra mandapam. Five-time puja is followed in the temple - Thiruvanandal, Kalasanthi, Uchi Kala, Sayaraksha and Arthajama at scheduled times from early morning till night. The temple has five cars-Raths for Lords Vinayaka, Muruga, Pazhamalai Nathar, Mother Periyanayagi and Sri Chandikeswara. The place has five names – Tirumudhu Kundram, Vruddha Kasi, Virudhachalam, Nerkuppai and Mudhugiri. Specialities Legend of the temple Unaffected by flood It is the faith of the devotees that salvation is surety if he/she is born in the place, or live in the place, or pray the Lord here, or even thinking of him even while elsewhere and die in this place. One of the above five criteria will free him/her from the cycle of births and deaths. When the world was destroyed by pralaya floods, it is said that this holy place - Virudhachalam stood unaffected and fully alive. Of the 1008 Shiva shrines of the country considered in high esteem, four lead this divine list of which Virudhachalam is one. Virutha Kasi It is one of the places giving salvation to the departed. It is even considered holier than Holy Kasi i.e. Varanasi. As believed in Kasi, here too Mother Viruthambigai places the departed souls on her lap and fan them with the pallu of her Sari while Lord Shiva chants the Namasivaya mantra in the ears of the dead ensuring his/her salvation. Hence in olden days people of Virudhachalam never bothered to undertake a pilgrimage to Varanasi when they become old and weak. As a result, this place is also come to known as Virudhakasi. It is also claimed that the benefit measure is a little bit more here than Kasi, hence the saying “Kasiyil Veesam Adhigam in Virudhakasi”. The ashes of the dead when dissolved in Manimuthar River change into a stone and stay underneath, according to Sthalapuranam. Lord Shiva as Nataraja danced in Thillai for a contest. He played here for his own joy. Mother Peria Nayaki fed King During his visit to this place, the king of Karnataka suffered due to hunger. Mother Peria Nayaki, as a young woman fed him with milk and named him Kumara Deva. Mother's appearance Viruthambigai means Goddess of elderly age. Devotee Guru Namshivayar stayed in this place for a night on his way to Chidambaram. He was very hungry and called Mother with a verse with a word Kizhavi. Mother Periyanayagi came there as an old woman and replied that Kizhavi-old woman cannot bring food, only young woman can. The devotee sang another verse describing the youthfulness of Ambica. She appeared as a young beautiful woman and fed the devotee and thus came to be known as Balambika – young Mother. Maasi Magam Maasi Magam is an important festival. It is believed that Vibasithu Munivar sought the darshan of Lord Siva, through the Nandi. On the sixth day of the Masi Magam festival, Lord Vriddhagiriswarar, along with his Consort Goddess Viruthambigai, appeared before Vibasithu Munivar.  Architecture  The ancient Chola temple of Vriddhagiriswarar was commissioned by Sembiyan Mahadevi, among the most powerful queens of the Chola empire and an ardent worshipper of Lord Siva. The temple is surrounded by high walls and five gopurams. The mandapam is carved like a chariot. The chains of the temple car were donated by Charles Hyde, the District Collector of the then South Arcot district in 1813. The place was originally called Thirumudukundram, the place of holy mountain. Similar architecture of halls (Mandapas) simulating a chariot drawn by elephant or horses is found in Sarangapani temple at Kumbakonam, Mela Kadambur Amirthakadeswarar Temple, Sikharagiriswara Temple, Kudumiyamalai, Nageswaraswamy Temple, Kumbakonam, and Thyagaraja Temple, Tiruvarur.

Operated by the Chicago Public Schools district, Near North opened in September 1979. Near North served as a new and replacement school for the area when Cooley Vocational High School was closed at the end of the 1978–1979 school year due to inadequate conditions within the building. In addition to being a magnet school, Near North offered vocational courses through the Education To Careers (ETC) program. Near North closed in June 2001 due to the decline in its enrollment and the city's plans for the surrounding neighborhood. History In November 1974, The Chicago Board of Education decided to phase out Cooley High due to its poor academic performance and the aged building. In March of the following year, The Chicago Public Schools (CPS) and the board decided a newer and modern school needed to be constructed on the near–north side to replace Cooley. When it became time to decide a location for the school, CPS decided to build the new school on the land where Cooley stood. City council and white community members argued that Cooley's location would only serve the residents of Cabrini–Green, a predominately African–American housing project located within walking distance (as Cooley did over time) and that students from other neighborhoods would be afraid to travel through the housing project. After years of debating about the location of the new school, The board voted on what they considered a neutral location for the school in August 1977. The location was a vacant landfill north-west of Cooley, bordered by North Avenue to the north, Clybourn Avenue to the south, Larrabee Street to the east.

According to a newspaper account, the real-life model for the figure was Dominic Joseph Balestrieri, who later became a city of Milwaukee fireman who died in 1961.[Albano, Laurie Muench. Milwaukee County parks. Charleston, SC: Arcadia Pub., 2007. Print.], Other citizens liked the work so much they raised $800 to have a replica cast in Bremen, Germany, and placed in Lake Park in 1927, north of the streetcar depot. The fountain charmed visitors to the park until 1964 when vandalism to the base caused park officials to remove it and place the bronze in storage.[Buck, Diane M., and Virginia A. Palmer. Outdoor Sculpture in Milwaukee: a cultural and historical guidebook. madison: State Historical Society Of Wisconsin, 1995. Print.], Outdoor Sculpture in Milwaukee: A Cultural and Historical Guidebook Location history When the Mandel Group, developers of East Point Commons, announced plans for multi-family housing to be located on nine blocks of the abandoned Park East freeway corridor, the City of Milwaukee dedicated part of the land to become a small public park to be maintained by the owners. An art advocacy citizens' group, Art Action, saw this development as an opportunity to retrieve the Boy with Goose bronze, which had languished in county storage for many years. Art Action coordinated the cooperation between the private sector, the city, and the county to find the work and subsequently have the bronze restored, re-patinated, and sited in its present location. Artist The artist, Girolamo Piccoli, was born in Palermo, Italy in 1902. Brought to Milwaukee by his parents at the age of four, he later studied at the Wisconsin School of Art in Madison, and with Frank Vittor (1888–1968) in Pittsburgh (1921–1922), and Lorado Taft in Chicago (1923). Piccoli began teaching at the Layton School of Art in 1924 and became chair of the modeling (sculpture) department a year later. From 1924 to 1928 the sculptor won several awards for his work from the Milwaukee Art Institute and completed many private commissions. Piccoli left Layton in 1928 for New York City, where he opened a studio with his wife, also an artist. In the 1930s he was named Director of Sculpture for New York City under the Federal Art Program of the Great Depression.

According to Act Number 10 of 1964 (Undang-Undang Nomor 10 Tahun 1964), the current capital of Indonesia is Jakarta. Located on the island of Java, Jakarta was formerly called Batavia, its name during the Dutch colonial period. In the early 20th century, Dutch East Indies government attempted to relocate the capital from Batavia to Bandung. During Indonesia's struggle for independence, the government of Indonesia moved the capital to Yogyakarta and Bukittinggi, where it remained for a short time until the restoration of control of Jakarta. In 2019, during his annual state of the union address at the parliament, President Joko Widodo announced a plan to relocate the capital to Kalimantan on the island of Borneo. Part of Kutai Kartanegara Regency and Penajam North Paser Regency in East Kalimantan will be carved out to create a new province-level planned city. Relocation of the capital will move the capital to a more central location within Indonesia and is part of a strategy of reducing developmental inequality between Java and other islands in the Indonesian archipelago. It will also reduce Jakarta's burden as Indonesia's primary hub. In August 2019, the government announced that while the capital will be moved, $40 billion will be spent on saving Jakarta from sinking in the next decade.

The Dutch colonial settlement of Batavia (present-day Jakarta) was established in 1621. Initially, it was a European-styled walled city crisscrossed by Dutch-style canals located in a low-lying coastal swamp area. The poor sanitation and weak water drainage system made the city unhealthy, infested with malaria, cholera, and dysentery. In 1808, Daendels decided to quit the by-then dilapidated and unhealthy Old Town. A new town centre was subsequently built further to the south, near the estate of Weltevreden. Batavia thereby became a city with two centres: Kota as the hub of business, where the offices and warehouses of shipping and trading companies were located; while Weltevreden became the new home for the government, military, and shops. These two centres were connected by the Molenvliet Canal and a road (now Gajah Mada Road) that ran alongside the waterway. In the early 20th century, there was a decision by the Dutch East Indies government to relocate the capital from Batavia to Bandung. The idea was to separate the busy trading port or the commercial centre (Batavia) from the new administrative and political centre (Bandung). By the 1920s the plan to transfer the capital to Bandung was underway. As the city began the master- plan of a well-planned new city, some government buildings, telecommunication (now Telkom Indonesia), railway networks (now Kereta Api Indonesia), Postal system (now Pos Indonesia), defence-military headquarters and many others were constructed and headquartered in Bandung until the present day, such as Gedung Sate which was planned as the government administrative centre of the Dutch East Indies. The plan, however, failed due to the Great Depression and the outbreak of World War II. On 5 March 1942, Batavia fell to the Japanese. The Dutch formally surrendered to the Japanese occupation forces on 9 March 1942, and the rule of the colony was transferred to Japan. The city was renamed Jakarta (officially ジャカルタ特別市 Jakaruta tokubetsu-shi, Special Municipality of Jakarta, under the special status that was assigned to the city). After the collapse of Japan in 1945, the area went through a period of transition and upheaval during the Indonesian national struggle for independence. During the Japanese occupation and from the perspective of the Indonesian nationalists who declared independence on 17 August 1945, the city was renamed Jakarta. Following the surrender of the Japanese, Indonesia declared its independence on 17 August 1945. The proclamation was enacted at Jalan Pegangsaan Timur No. 56 (now Jalan Proklamasi), Central Jakarta, with Suwiryo acting as the committee chairman. Suwiryo was recognised as the first mayor of Jakarta Tokubetsu Shi. The position was soon altered to Pemerintah Nasional Kota Jakarta (\\"Jakarta City National Administration\\"). On 19 September 1945, Sukarno held his Indonesian independence and anti-colonialism/imperialism speech, during Rapat Akbar or grand meeting at Lapangan Ikada, now the Merdeka Square. The grand meeting would start a period of national revolution in Indonesia.Lapangan Merdeka / Monas. Merdeka Square page on official website of Jakarta. National revolution period During the Indonesian struggle for independence (1945–1949), the capital of the republic was moved several times — prompted by political and military emergency — as the seat of the republic in exile during the war. The capital moved from Jakarta to Yogyakarta (1946–1948) and then to Bukittinggi (1948–1949) as the seat of the Emergency Government of the Republic of Indonesia. By 1949, the national capital of the republic was returned to Jakarta. Jakarta as the de jure capital of Indonesia Monas stands in the centre of Merdeka Square, in the heart of the national capital of Jakarta. Most of Jakarta's landmarks and monuments were built during the Sukarno era. During Sukarno's presidency, Jakarta was established and developed as the capital of the new republic. In 1957, Sukarno laid the foundation and street grid layout of Palangkaraya as a new planned capital of Central Kalimantan province. Sukarno however, foresaw the new city as the possible new national capital in the future. The vast available area and its geographic location in the centre of the archipelago was the main advantage of the city. Nevertheless, Sukarno seemed to favour Jakarta instead. In the late 1950s to the first half of the 1960s, he filled Jakarta with monuments and statues. Numbers of monumental projects were conceived, planned, and initiated during his administration, including Monumen Nasional, Istiqlal mosque, DPR/MPR Building, and Gelora Bung Karno stadium. Sukarno also filled Jakarta with nationalistic monuments and statues, including Selamat Datang Monument, Pemuda Monument at Senayan, Dirgantara Monument at Pancoran, and the Irian Jaya Liberation Monument at Lapangan Banteng. Although many of the projects were completed later, Sukarno is credited for shaping Jakarta's monuments and landmarks. He desired Jakarta to be the beacon of a powerful new nation. In 1966, Jakarta was granted its official status as DKI (Daerah Khusus Ibukota) Djakarta, or the Special Capital Region. It promoted the rate of development of government office buildings and foreign embassies. Rapid development created the need for a master plan in order to regulate Jakarta's growth. Since 1966, Jakarta has steadily grown into a modern metropolis. During the highly centralised New Order regime of Sukarno's successor Suharto, Jakarta was further established as the political and economic core of the nation. Prompted with rapid development and urbanisation, Jakarta attracted large numbers of new settlers from all over the archipelago, with the majority coming from rural Javanese towns. High-rise buildings sprung up, especially in Jakarta's commercial and financial centres along Thamrin, Sudirman and Kuningan avenues. As a result, since the 1970s, the population of Jakarta spiked tremendously and spiled into areas surrounding the capital. The Jabodetabek or Greater Jakarta region has become the largest and the most densely populated urban agglomeration in Southeast Asia.  New capital proposals throughout the decades Proposals to move the Indonesian capital from Jakarta to other locations have been discussed since the Sukarno presidency. Massive overpopulation, coupled with a lack of urban infrastructures such as public transportation facilities; gridlock traffic; encroachment of urban areas replacing open green spaces; spread of slums within the city; over-extraction of groundwater, and poor water drainage systems: all of these factors have led to ecological degradation of the city. As groundwater was depleted, the city slowly sunk lower; parts of Northern Jakarta are below sea level and regularly suffer from flooding. Jakarta experienced massive floods in 2007, and again in 2013. In 2010, the debate continued about the creation of a new capital that would be separated from the urban, economic, and commercial centre of the country. Former president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono supported the idea to create a new political and administrative centre of Indonesia, due to Jakarta's environmental and overpopulation problems. Palangkaraya by President Sukarno, dated 17 July 1957. This monument is colloquially known locally as the Sukarno Monument. Two major alternative approaches have been mooted over the years: One was to move the national capital altogether by creating an entirely new planned city, similar to the relocation of the Brazilian capital from Rio de Janeiro to Brasilia, a planned city, in 1960. The other was to keep Jakarta as the official capital but create a separate administrative centre, as when Malaysia moved its federal administrative centre to Putrajaya. Suggested locations for the first proposal have included: *Palangkaraya, Central Kalimantan. Since it was established as the capital of Central Kalimantan province in 1957, the first president of Indonesia, Sukarno, outlined a plan to develop Palangkaraya as the future capital of Indonesia. Palangkaraya is far more extensive in area than Jakarta and safe from the danger of earthquakes and volcanoes, which are common on Java. *Banjarmasin, South Kalimantan. Compared to Palangkaraya, Banjarmasin is located closer to the centre of the country, has better access to the Java Sea and has better infrastructure.Kota-kota yang Diusulkan Jadi Ibukota  koran terbaru – berita seputar indonesia *Kota Merdeka is a proposed planned city located north of Pangkalan Bun town, West Kotawaringin Regency, Central Kalimantan. Compared to far inland Palangkaraya, Kota Merdeka is located nearer to coastal areas and has better access to the Java Sea. *Pontianak, West Kalimantan. Located ideally on the equator and strategically located by the Karimata Strait and the South China Sea, in the same region with other ASEAN capitals such as Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, and Bandar Seri Begawan. *Palembang, South Sumatra. The city has historical significance, as the former capital of the Srivijaya maritime empire; which symbolise the return of the archipelago's former glory. It is also strategically located near the main maritime route of the Malacca Strait, near the other ASEAN capitals of Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.Palembang Ikut Diusulkan Jadi Pengganti Jakarta, Detik.com If Jakarta were kept as the official capital, administrative centres would have been moved to other nearby locations. Suggested locations include: *Jonggol, West Java. Located about 40 kilometres southeast from Jakarta, and proposed future capital of Indonesia since the New Order. *Karawang, West Java, located about 60 kilometres east of Jakarta. *Kertajati, Majalengka Regency, West Java. Located about 200 kilometres east of Jakarta and 40 kilometres west of Cirebon. The proposed planned capital will be connected to the planned West Java new airport, Java railways and the Trans-Java toll road. The underused airport has been derided as a 'white elephant' during the 2019 presidential elections and policymakers are under pressure to demonstrate utility for the enormous bills related to the project. *Maja, Lebak Regency, Banten. Located about 60 kilometres west of Jakarta. Most of Maja lands are already acquired by the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency. *Jakarta Bay, North Jakarta. In 2013, Joko Widodo, then Governor of Jakarta, proposed to move the administrative centre of Indonesia to the planned future reclaimed islands in Jakarta Bay. This plan is in line with the planned National Capital Integrated Coastal Development; the new administrative district will be located on a Garuda bird-shaped island planned to be built on Jakarta Bay. Move to East Kalimantan Balikpapan is the gateway to the new capital of Indonesia. In April 2017, the Joko Widodo (Jokowi) administration contemplated the idea of moving the capital from Jakarta. The government planned to conclude assessing potential alternative sites that would be suitable to become Indonesia's new capital by the end of 2017. According to an official from the Ministry of National Development Planning of Indonesia (Bappenas), the government was determined to move the Indonesian capital out of Java. In April 2019, it was announced that Jakarta would no longer be the capital of Indonesia in the future, with a 10-year plan to transfer all government offices to a new capital city. The National Development Planning Ministry recommended the three provinces of South, Central, and East Kalimantan as all fitting the requirements for a new capital, including being relatively free from earthquakes and volcanoes. Shortly after the plan was announced in April 2017, Jokowi visited two alternative locations in Kalimantan, Bukit Soeharto in East Kalimantan and the Triangle Area near Palangkaraya in Central Kalimantan. On 26 August 2019, Jokowi announced that the new capital would be partly in the Penajam North Paser Regency and partly in the Kutai Kartanegara Regency, both in East Kalimantan. The National Development Planning Ministry announced that the move would cost an estimated Rp466 trillion ($US32.7 billion), and that the government intended to cover 19% of the cost, the remainder coming mainly from public-private partnerships and direct investment by both state-owned enterprises and the private sector. The planned move still awaits final parliamentary approval.  Proposed design and name  Then Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing organized capital city design contest from 3 October to 20 December 2019. Nagara Rimba Nusa ('Forest Archipelago') by URBAN+ was officially announced as the winner on 23 December 2019. The government will collaborate the design of the winning team with that of second and third placed teams, as well as international designers, in order to sharpen the final design process up to March or April 2020. Designers from at least 3 countries, namely China, Japan, and the United States had offered to involve in the design. The name which had been suggested since about 3 months earlier is very identical with the winner's main concept.  Tsunami risk  A potential tsunami risk in the region has been identified by geologists, based on evidence of multiple ancient underwater landslides.

Location The temple is located in Cuddalore, aka Thirupathiripuliyur. The temple is 0.5 km from Thirupathiripuliyur Railway Station. Padaleeswarar Temple is one of the ancient temples in Tamil Nadu. The temple plays a unique role in the history of Hindu religion, art, and architecture. Religious significance Appar's sister Thilakavathiyar was living in Thiruvathigai during her later years and devoted her lifetime service to Shiva. Afflicted by a painful illness, Thirunavukkarasar, who was originally called Dharmasenar and was then a staunch follower of Jainism, prayed for relief at this temple where his sister Thilagavathiyar served. By the divine grace of Shiva, he was cured. He embraced Saivism from then and started canonizing various temples with his verses. The ruling Pallava king namely Kadava punished Thirunavukarasar in various ways and finally dropped him in a lime kiln. He was subsequently cast on the waters of sea, where he started floating and was pushed ashore in Thirupathipuliyur. It is believed that some of his best songs were sung at this time in praise of the presiding deities at Padaleeswarar temple and Veerateneeswarar temple. Influenced by the greatness of the poet, the king himself converted to Shaivism from Hinduism.. Once, Lord Shiva and Parvathi were playing the game of dice. Though Parvathi won every time, the Lord Shiva could not accept it. The Lordess said that she will cover the eyes of Shiva and to check if he really can win.Thus saying she covered the eyes of the Shiva. The entire world plunged into darkness. A few seconds there, seemed infinite time for Gods. The moment of that occasion led all human creations including other Gods to realize a long duration of Yugas of inactiveness. Parvathi after realizing that she has committed a grave mistake prayed for forgiveness. Lord Shiva advised Parvathi to go to earth and pray in all the 1008 Shiva Sthalams and in which Sthala the left eye & shoulder vibrates, there she should penance. Accordingly, in the course of Sthala yatra of Parvathi when she came to pray in this Sthala (Thirupathiripuliyur Padaleeswarar temple) the diving occasion of vibration of left eye and left shoulder happened. So Parvathi started doing her penance in the Aruba form (arunthava nayagi) and married lord Shiva.

Early life and education He was born in Istanbul , Turkey. He graduated from Robert College in 1989. After briefly studying photography in London, he returned to the US to study film. He received his MA from The New School in New York City where he worked as a teaching assistant. Kazma has been living in Istanbul since 2000.  Selected works and projects  Kazma's videos raise fundamental questions about the meaning and significance of human activity and labor and the meaning of economy, production, and social organisation. He has exhibited his work in the Istanbul Bienniall (2001, 2007, 2011), Tokyo Opera City (2001), Platform Garanti Contemporary Art Centre (Istanbul, 2004), Istanbul Modern (2004), 9th Havana Biennial (2006), San Francisco Art Institute (2006), Lyon Biennial (2007), Sao Paulo Biennial (2012) among others. Ali Kazma was granted the 2001 UNESCO Award for the Promotion of the Arts and received the 2010 Nam June Paik Award given by North Rhine-Westphalia Art Foundation in the field of media art, with his “Obstructions” series that he had been working on since 2005. Living and working in Istanbul as a video artist since 1998 and becoming internationally established from 2007, Ali Kazma creates sets of short films that are usually between ten and twelve minutes long. In his multi-video formats, Kazma creates archives of the human condition through his fascination with man and the nature of life and death. In presenting the audience with conflicting notions of human nature, as well as our spatial relationship with our body and our physical surroundings, we are shown the complexities within these topics.http://theculturetrip.com/europe/turkey/articles/the-art-of-resistance- ali-kazma-to-represent-turkey-at-the-venice-biennale/ Kazma is represented by Galeri Nev Istanbul.http://www.galerinevistanbul.com/artist/ali-kazma/ Obstructions In the video series he has been producing since 2005 under the heading of Obstructions, Ali Kazma has carried out research into the tense equilibrium between order and chaos, and life and death, into the efforts of the human being to hold together a world inclined towards disintegration and destruction, and the diversity of physical production developed to achieve this, and what such production might mean in the context of human nature. The Obstructions series was instigated by a 37-day performative work Ali Kazma realized for Istanbul Pedestrian Exhibitions II: Tünel-Karaköy, an exhibition co-curated for public space by Fulya Erdemci and Emre Baykal in 2005. In this work titled Today, Kazma had tracked down micro-level production and repair activities within the daily life of the neighbourhood where the exhibition took place. He first recorded and edited these activities with his camera during the day and later projected them onto a shop window facing Tünel Square in the evening on the same day. After the working hours ended and the time for rest arrived, the shift of Kazma’s work started, conveying the events of the day into the night throughout the exhibition period. Employing a small shift in time as its presentation strategy, this performative work articulated the artist’s own physical and mental labour as part of the daily routine of the neighbourhood and rendered visible in fragments all kinds of production, maintenance and repair activities that we often pass by without paying any attention –or do not see at all, because they are carried out indoors. Today brought, into its own field of research, the human body at work in the broadest sense of the word, the tools that function as the extensions of the body, the common gestures and acts of working bodies, and the grammar of its language formed via similarities between these gestures and acts. The Obstructions series, presently comprising 16 works, was triggered by the idea of revisiting the fragments that made up Today stripped of their urban/spatial context; and expanded by incorporating other categories of production that were not included in Today. The majority of works in the Obstruction series have a focus on the effort human beings exert for the continuity, comfort, measurement, control, maintenance, repair etc. of the body. The field of execution, or the final product of such activities could either be a material object that supports or supplements the body (Jean Factory, Rolling Mills, Clock Master, Cuisine), while at other times the body becomes the site of performance (Dancer, Painter), or operation itself (Brain Surgeon).Press release of the Turkish Pavilion for the 55th International Venice Biennial Resistance Kazma's Resistance series grows out from within the Obstructions series; and explores how the body is shaped today via scientific, cultural and social tools and how as a performance site it is repeatedly re- produced. In other words, Resistance conveys the productive activity of the body as a creative force directly onto the body itself; the producer and the produced, the shaper and the shaped this time unite in the materiality of the body.Press release of the Turkish Pavilion for the 55th International Venice Biennial The effort to resist, implied in the title of this series, references the fundamental scientific truth that everything must eventually disintegrate, and perish. Ali Kazma’s Obstructions point towards the sum of production and repair activities as the human being’s endless effort against this absolute process of annihilation –and ultimately death– in order to at least decelerate and delay this process. In Resistance, Ali Kazma explores the discourses, techniques and management tactics developed for the body today and focuses on the interventions and strategies that both release the body from its own restrictions and restrict it in order to control it. He attempts to understand the changes the body undergoes not only via the subjects before his camera, but also via the spaces that stage the reconstruction of the subject. The metaphorical perception which since Ancient Greece sees the body as the coffin, cage, or cell that confines the mind or the spirit takes “Resistance” into spaces where bodies are controlled, disciplined and restricted –yet almost no body is seen within the architectural confines recorded by Ali Kazma. Resistance provides important clues regarding the direction Ali Kazma’s artistic production is likely to evolve as it promises to expand in time in order to include within its scope the infinite knowledge that counts the body as its source, both as a real and restricted image, and as a field of infinite possibilities. Venice Biennial Ali Kazma represented Turkey in the 55th International Art Exhibition, la Biennale di Venezia. Curated by Emre Baykal, the Pavilion of Turkey at the 55th Venice Biennial featured Ali Kazma’s video series Resistance. In Resistance, Ali Kazma explores the discourses, techniques and management tactics developed for the body today and focuses on the interventions and strategies that both release the body from its own restrictions and restrict it in order to control it. Kazma attempts to read the complex meanings and the enigma produced by the body as a physical and conceptual space from within a broad network of relations. Amongst the various settings of Resistance are a film set in Paris, a prison in Sakarya, a school and a hospital operating room in Istanbul, a university where robot production and experimental research is carried out in Berlin, a medical research laboratory in Lausanne, a tattoo studio in London, and a theatre hall in New York.http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/ali-kazma-3/ References External links * Ali Kazma at 10th Istanbul Biennial * Video series Obstructions at Tanas Berlin Nam June Paik Award 2010 Living people 1971 births Turkish contemporary artists ","title":"Ömer Ali Kazma"},{"id":"30108464","text":"The 2007–08 Lebanese Second Division was the 74th season of the Second Division league which featured 14 Clubs. 2 of these teams were eligible for promotion to the top league of Lebanese football, the Lebanese Premier League while 2 of the 14 teams had to face relegation to the Lebanese Third Division for the 2007–08 Season.

It is situated in Thiruvathigai village which is about 2 kilometres east from the town of Panruti in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu, India. Shiva is worshiped as Veerattaaneswarar, and is represented by the lingam. His consort Parvati is depicted as Thiripurasundari. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the nayanars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam. The temple is considered the place where the Saiva saint poet Appar (Thirunavukkarasar) converted back to Saivism, and attained final salvation. The temple complex is one of the largest in the state and it houses two gateway towers known as gopurams. The temple has numerous shrines, with those of Veerateeswarar and Mookambigai being the most prominent. The temple complex houses many halls and three precincts; the most notable is the second precinct built during the Vijayanagar period that has many sculptures. The temple has six daily rituals at various times from 5:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., and twelve yearly festivals on its calendar. The temple is maintained and administered by Thiruvaduthurai Adheenam, a South Indian monastic institution. Legend Legend of Shiva as Veerateeswarar Legend holds that this temple is the place where Shiva destroyed three rakshashas and the three cities created by them. Saranarayana Perumal, another name of Vishnu, is the one who gave the arrow to Shiva for killing the demons, whose temple is also located in the town, little easterly. Shiva Purana details the legend of destruction of the demon Tripuran, who was ruling Tripura. The destruction is detailed as a cosmic event, which most attribute to the destruction of stars, meteors and unexplained material bodies. Tripuran attacked all the celestial deities who sought the help of Shiva to protect them. Shiva after a fiery fight, destroyed Tripuran and attained the name Tripurantaka. Shiva ashed down the city Tripura and dipped his three fingers in the ashes, which signifies the three lines of ash which is worn by all shaivites on their forehead. As per another variant, the three sons of Taraka obtained boons from Brahma and built an impregnable fortress on earth. On account of their atrocious activities, mother earth prayed to Shiva for rescue. Shiva burnt down the fort and was about to attack the trio, but they begged for mercy. He made two of them as Dvarapalas and one as his damaroo, which he sports in his right hand. The whole incident is believed to have taken place in Thiruvathigai on the banks of Kedilam. The original name of the place was called Tripura Dahanam, which went on to become Thiruvathigai.Madhavan 2014, p. 93 During Tripurasamharam, the killing of Tripurantaka, Shiva forgot to worship Ganesha before setting out for the battle. He realized it and came back to worship Ganesha and went ahead to win the demon. The same legend is associated with Aksheeswaraswamy Temple, Acharapakkam and Thiruvirkolam Sri Tripuranthaka Swami temple.  History  The Pallava king Mahendravarman I converted from Jainism to Saivism under the influence of Appar. He is believed to have destroyed a Jain monastery and built a temple called Gunavareswaram close to the temple. Mahendra Pallava is believed to have attained the name Gunavareswara on account of the incident. A king called Kalinkaraya is believed to have endowed lot of treasures and built various structures in the temple as seen from the inscriptions in the temple. King Raja Raja Chola I is believed to have stayed in this temple for a long time to study the architecture before building Brihadeeswarar Temple. The temple is believed to have been expanded by later Pandyas. During the period of Marthas and British Colonization, the temple acted as a fort to the armies. The inscriptions indicate that the streets have to be cleaned before any temple procession with the likes of the streets in this village. Architecture The temple is located in Thiruvathigai, a village 2 km from Panruti in Cuddalore district. The temple covers an area of with three precincts. The temple has a seven tiered gateway tower which has sculptures depicting 108 poses of Bharatanatyam. There is a sixteen pillared hall called Thiruneetru mandapam, which is believed to have constructed at the behest of Thilagavathiyar, the sister of Appar to commemorate his conversion to Saivism. There is a temple tank named Chakrateertha kulam and a Vasantha mandapam on the northern portion of the tank. On the second precinct, there is a flag staff and a five tiered temple tower. The sanctum is built on an elevated structure. There are shrines around the sanctum in the first precinct that has a shrine of Thilagavathiar, a pillared hall housing the sixty three nayanmar, Saniswarar, Durga, Siddivinayagar, Muruga, a set of Lingam, Nataraja and Surya. The shrine of Umayammai, the consort of the presiding deity, is present. The shrine houses the image of Lingam which is believed to have worshiped by Vishnu. There is a south facing shrine in the hall before the sanctum where the image of Tripurasamharamurthy with sixteen hands is housed. Sanctum houses the image of Veerataneswarar in the form of lingam. There is an image of Ammayapar housed in the sanctum. The shrine over the sanctum has a pyramidal roof with stucco images all through the filial at the top. Worship and festivals Stucco images on the vimanam The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. Like other Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Shaivaite community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed six times a day; Ushathkalam at 6:00 a.m., Kalasanthi at 8:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 12:00 p.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m., Irandamkalam at 8:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 9:00 p.m. Each ritual comprises four steps: abhisheka (sacred bath), alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Veerateeswarar and Thiripurasundari. There are weekly rituals like ' and ', fortnightly rituals like pradosham and monthly festivals like amavasai (new moon day), kiruthigai, pournami (full moon day) and sathurthi. The most prominent festival of the temple, Vasantha Utsavam, is celebrated for ten days during the Tamil month of Chittirai. The festival deity of presiding deity and his consort circumambulate the temple and the streets in the village in different vehicles. Vaikasi Brahmotsavam during the Tamil month of Vaikasi (May - June) and the ten day Sadayam star festival associated with the day Appar got salvation are other important festivals of the temple. Religious significance As per legends, Shiva is believed to have destroyed eight different demons namely Andakasuran, Gajasuran, Jalandasuran, Thirupuradhi, Kaman, Arjunan, Dakshan and Taaragasuran. There are Ashta Veeratanam temples built signifying each of his victories in the war, and also as places where he is believed to have performed with fury.Madhavan 2014, p. 145 The eight temples are: Tiruvadigai Veerattaaneswarar Temple at Thiruvadigai, Tirukkovilur Veerateshwarar Temple at Tirukoilur, Veerateswarar temple at Korukkai or Thirukkurukkai, Amirtagateswarar Temple at Thirukadaiyur, Vazhuvur Verateswarar Temple at Vazhuvoor, Keelaparasalur Veerateswarar Temple at Tirupariyalur, Kandeeswarar Temple at Thirukkandiyur and Tiruvirkudi Veerataneswarar Temple at Thiruvirkudi. Shiva in all these temples are described to have used bow and arrow, trident and spear. Appar's sister Thilakavathiyar settled here during her later years and devoted her lifetime service to Shiva. Afflicted by a painful illness, Thirunavukkarasar, who was originally called Dharmasenar and was then a staunch follower of Jainism, prayed for relief at this temple where his sister Thilagavathiyar served. By the divine grace of Shiva, he was cured. He embraced Saivism from then and started canonizing various temples with his verses. The ruling Pallava king namely Kadava punished Thirunavukarasar in various ways and finally dropped him in a lime kiln. He was subsequently cast on the waters of sea, where he started floating and was pushed ashore in Thirupathipuliyur. It is believed that some of his best songs were sung at this time in praise of the presiding deities at Padaleeswarar temple and Veerateneeswarar temple. Thirunavukkarasar came back to Thiruvathigai from Thirupathripuliyur. Influenced by the greatness of the poet, the king himself converted to Shaivism from Hinduism. Appar venerated Veerateeswarar in seventeen verses in Tevaram, compiled as the Fourth Tirumurai, Fifth Tirumurai and Sixth Tirumurai. The Soolai Kinaru, a well in the temple is believed to be the limestone well where Appar was dropped by the Jains. Though the actual location was in Cuddalore, the well is maintained as an indicative example of the event. The water from the well is taken by people suffering from stomach related ailments. Tirugnana Sambandar, a 7th-century Tamil Saivite poet and a contemporary of Appar, venerated Veerateeswarar in 46 verses in Tevaram, compiled as the First Tirumurai. According to the Hindu legend Sambanthar had a vision of cosmic dance of Shiva at this place. As per another legend, Sundarar, another saint poet, did not enter the temple as it was already praised by Appar. He was sleeping outside the temple where an old man stepped on his head. Sundarar avoided him and turned his head toward other direction, but the old man still stepped on his head. Sundarar wanted to know who the old man was when Shiva appeared in his true form in front of him. The temple called Siddapureeswarar near Panruti is associated with the legend. Sundarar also venerated Veerateeswarar in one verse in Tevaram, compiled as the Seventh Tirumurai. As the temple is revered in Tevaram, it is classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam, one of the 275 temples that find mention in the Saiva canon.

Instead, a single design of 249 underframes was constructed, with identical structure, bogies, couplers and brake equipment. Different bodies were provided on these frames for each purpose. The most common, by far, was the convertible flat/open truck, followed by cattle, louvred, insulated and boxcar types. From 1926, all of the goods stock which had double-letter classification, were simplified to single-letter classification (e.g. NMM became NM). In more recent years, the E.T.R.B. has started a process of reclassifying all previously double-letter classified goods stock back to its original identities. This is in recognition of the adopted Era of Significance for the Railway, which covers period 1900–1930, during which time they mostly had the double letter coding. The same frame design was later used for the second generation of NBH passenger carriages, after the first had been converted from NQR flat/open trucks. Convertible Flat/Open trucks—NQR The NQR class of trucks were the staple of the Victorian Railways' narrow gauge fleet. 218 examples were constructed between 1898 and 1914,http://pjv101.net/cd/pages/c445d.htm designed as an open wagon with removable end panels as well as three drop-down but removable doors either side. When assembled into the open wagon format these wagons were designed to have the same capacity (weight and volume) as a normal broad gauge four-wheel open truck, to make load transferring easier at the interchange stations—Colac, Wangaratta, Upper Ferntree Gully and Moe. The goods truck code had been derived from the conceptually similar broad-gauge QR trucks, which had removable sides to permit various types of loading. Previously, \\"Q\\" had been used for bogie flat wagons and \\"R\\" for bogie open trucks. Letters and numbers were originally painted only on the end bulkheads and doors and the side doors, both of which could be removed as traffic dictated, and this made vehicle identification difficult until these details were transferred to the underframes of each truck. The superscript \\"N\\" changed to regular script in the goods vehicle recoding following the auto coupler conversion in 1926. Some of these trucks were fitted with seats and frameworks supporting shelter to cater for holiday traffic on the Gembrook line. In particular, NQR trucks 114 and 140 were identified as having screw-type hand brakes fitted in addition to normal air brakes, permitting their use in lieu of brake vans—but only in the Up direction, and only for holiday traffic.Victorian Railways, General Appendix to the Book of Rules and Regulations and to the Working Time Table, April 1919, p.350 NBH In April 1919 NQR wagons 31, 33, 36, 38, 39 and 46 were rebuilt into the first of the NBH passenger carriages, numbered 1 through 6 respectively and used for second-class passenger holiday traffic by adding seats, a removable roof on poles and tarps for wagon sides and doors. Over the years, a number of NQRs were provided with removable wood and steel frameworks with canvas roof canopies and side curtains, and internal seating to supplement the rest of the passenger stock during busy holiday periods. Puffing Billy has re-created these in modified form for emergency capacity. Five more NQRs, numbered 219–223, were built between 1990 and 1992 initially for passenger use so were fitted with the removable frames. Flat wagons—NQ In 1926 the class was relettered from NQR to NQ, reflecting their use more often than not as flat wagons rather than open wagons. Most of the class then remained in service until the early 1950s, when the four VR lines closed and mass scrappings of narrow-gauge stock began. Puffing Billy Railway currently has NQRs 135 and 219–223 inclusive, fitted with seats and a canopy, and NQR 146 without a canopy. All seven have a capacity of 28 passengers, and a weight of . In goods service NQR wagons 21, 91, 186 and 216 are in service with a goods capacity of and a tare weight of , and NQR can be fitted with seats if necessary to match the configuration of NQR 146. The Railway also possesses untrafficable trucks: NQ 19 is configured for pulpwood while NQ 149 is fitted with a water tank that can hold of water, and open NQRs 59, 92, 103, 125, 142, 151, 153 and 203. There are also six off-register NQR wagons, numbers 23, 26, 29, 94, 110 and 169. All of these excepting NQR 149 have a tare weight of and a loading capacity of , while NQR 149 has a tare weight of and a loading capacity of , due to the weight of the water tank. Cattle trucks—NMM This class consisted of 15 vehicles. Construction started in 1899, but the first NMM did not enter service until 1903. After this the rest of the class followed slowly, with the last of the class not entering service until 1917. The looked similar to the MM cattle trucks, despite being built 25 years earlier. As part of the late 1920s recoding, the class was altered to NM. Around the same time, all but the class leader had autocouplers fitted (1 NM was not converted until 1941). In the mid-1920s there was a derailment on the Moe–Walhalla line. In the consist were NM vehicles. It was determined that the derailment was caused by \\"spooked\\" horses in an NM vehicle. The vehicle was coupled next to an NA tank engine which was running bunker first. The smoke from the funnel apparently was the reason for the distress. After this investigation, the ends of all the NM class were progressively boarded up. As the narrow-gauge lines were closed, the trucks were sold off. Most were scrapped; 13 NMM is used by Puffing Billy on wood trains, and 6 NM was recently rescued from a farm and is currently in storage awaiting restoration. Louvred trucks—NUU The standard louvred truck design for the Victorian narrow-gauge lines, the NUU vehicles, were constructed in three batches; the first seven from 1899 to 1901, an eighth in 1906 and the last six in 1911, for a total class of fourteen. They looked very similar to the U trucks of the broad-gauge. These trucks were painted white until approximately 1910, as shown in two photographshttp://www.pjv101.net/fts/u01/ae685.jpghttp://www.pjv101.net/fts/u01/ae687.jpg of NUU 1. NU In 1926 the class was relettered to simply NU, with no changes to numbers. NU 4 was scrapped in 1938, but otherwise the class remained intact until 1954, when seven members (2, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11 and 12) were sold to Coulston & Hyder, who dispersed the wagons among locations on the Wangarrata to Whitfield line. As of 1996, Nos. 7 and 12 were at Moyhu, while No. 11 was destroyed by fire in 1978. No. 2 is in private ownership on display in a museum at Erica. Nos. 6 and 1 were scrapped in 1957 and 1958 respectively, while in 1954 van 13 was recorded as being sold to the Puffing Billy Preservation Society. In 1977, the remaining vans 3, 10 and 14 were handed over to the Emerald Tourist Railway Board, and removed from Victorian Railways records. The Puffing Billy Railway now possesses vans 3, 8, 10, 13 and 14. NW It is worth noting that between 1972 and 1977, 10 NU was lettered as 10 NW, indicating its use as a workmen's sleeper. Covered truck with explosives accommodation—NPH In June 1910, it was decided that a truck for the transportation of explosives would be useful; probably for the Moe- Walhalla line as Walhalla was a gold-mining town and the rail line had been built from Moe to provide a faster means of transportation than bullock teams from the sailing boats from Melbourne to Port Albert/Sale via Heyfield. NPH 1 was built on the standard design of underframe as most other narrow-gauge stock, but because it was not anticipated that explosives traffic would require use of the entire wagon, it was partitioned to give capacity for explosives, while the remaining 6 tons was for general goods. Unlike the NU and NT classes, this meant that the van had four double doors total. However, in late March 1911 the wagon had been converted to entirely general goods use, with the partition removed and a recoding to NH 1, the \\"H\\" in the class being a reference to the broad-gauge H covered trucks then in use. The vehicle was allowed to carry 10 tons of general goods. It gained autocouplers in 1928, and was sold the scrap dealer Coulston & Hyder in 1954. By 1988, the vehicle had been found and was placed into the Puffing Billy Museum at Menzies Creek. Insulated truck—NTT In October 1899 a single insulated truck, NTT 1, was built for the transportation of goods that needed to be kept cold, such as raw meat and dairy products. Like the NUU trucks, it was painted white from new, being repainted the standard venetian red of goods stock from about 1910. Its walls were thick. The truck was relettered to simply NT in 1926, but little else is known about the truck's history until 1988, when it was found and placed in Puffing Billy's Menzies Creek museum. Today, 1 NTT is used at Belgrave station for storage. Preservation Era Under the Emerald Tourist Railway Board, a range of rolling stock from other systems in Australia have been acquired and regauged for use on the Puffing Billy Railway to cater for the increased demand.https://puffingbilly.com.au/about/rolling-stock/carriage- fleet/ The primary example of goods vehicle is the acquisition from the Tasmanian Government Railways of a number of ballast hopper trucks. QG3 was the first to be converted for narrow gauge use, with an \\"N\\" prefix added. In 2003 the truck's identity was corrected to be consistent with Victorian Railways goods coding practise, with the new code of NNN1 representing the pre-1926 style.https://puffingbilly.com.au/about/rolling-stock/carriage-fleet/ The N prefix is for \\"narrow\\" gauge, and the suffix indicating that it is a bogie wagon much like NUU, NTT, etc. above. However, unlike those examples, it is likely that the Victorian Railways would have retained the \\"NNN\\" code instead of simplifying to \\"NN\\", because there was already a broad-gauge ballast vehicle of that classification.http://pjv101.net/cd/pages/c121m.htm A second ex-TGR QG wagon has since entered service on Puffing Billy as NNN2.https://puffingbilly.com.au/about/rolling-stock/carriage-fleet/ References * Narrow Gauge Rolling Stock * Narrow Gauge Stock * Puffing Billy Railway Rolling Stock Rolling stock of Victoria (Australia) ","title":"Victorian Railways narrow-gauge freight vehicles"},{"id":"30108549","text":"Susan Bonilla (born June 22, 1960) is an American politician who served in the California State Assembly, representing the 14th district, encompassing parts of Contra Costa and Solano counties.
