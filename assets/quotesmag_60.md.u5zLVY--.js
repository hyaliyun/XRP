History The beginning This station signed on in 1971, broadcasting with 3,000 watts of effective radiated power at 92.7 MHz as WULA-FM, an FM companion to AM sister station WULA, under the ownership of the Vogel-Milligan Corporation. The FM station primarily rebroadcast the programming of the AM station. On June 1, 1978, both WULA and WULA-FM were sold to WULA, Inc. As the station was beginning independent programming, WULA-FM's owners had the FCC change the call letters to WLAZ in 1978 and then to WKQK on April 6, 1981. A new era In July 1981, WULA, Inc., agreed to sell this station to McGowan Broadcasting, Inc. The deal was approved by the FCC on August 17, 1981. The call letters were changed to WKQK-FM on March 23, 1982 to accommodate a new AM sister station taking on the WKQK callsign. In April 1985, McGowan Broadcasting, Inc., signed an agreement to sell this station to Lake Eufala Broadcasting, Inc. The deal was approved by the FCC on June 27, 1985, and the transaction was consummated on August 29, 1985. The new owners applied for new call letters and they were changed back to the heritage WULA-FM on September 13, 1985. In August 1995, Lake Eufala Broadcasting, Inc., contracted to sell this station to McGowan Media, LLC. The deal was approved by the FCC on October 23, 1995, and the transaction was consummated on March 19, 1996. The original AM/FM combo was finally broken up when McGowan Media sold AM station WULA to Mark Hellinger in late 1996. In March 1997, McGowan Media, LLC, made a deal to sell this station to Woodfin Group subsidiary Hatchee Creek Communications, Inc. The deal was approved by the FCC on April 17, 1997, and the transaction was consummated on June 5, 1997. Owner Ken Woodfin increased the station's signal power, moved it into the Columbus, Georgia, market with a new classic rock format, and changed the branding to \\"The River\\". The station applied for new call letters to match their new branding and they were changed to WIOL on February 26, 1999. The present In mid-April 2004, Hatchee Creek Communications, Inc., reached an agreement to sell this station to Davis Broadcasting, Inc. The reported sale price for the station was $2.7 million. The deal was approved by the FCC on June 10, 2004, and the transaction was consummated on July 20, 2004. The callsign was changed to WKZJ on March 30, 2005, after a swap with a new sister station which took the WIOL callsign.

Between 2008 and 2020, Riser was a member of the Louisiana State Senate for the 32nd district. He was an unsuccessful candidate in the 2013 special election to fill Louisiana's 5th congressional district seat vacated by Rodney Alexander. He was defeated in the runoff election held on November 16, 2013, by fellow Republican Vance McAllister, a political newcomer from Swartz, who held the seat for only thirteen months. Riser was a candidate for state treasurer to succeed John Neely Kennedy, the U.S. senator from Louisiana. A special election was held to choose Kennedy's successor as treasurer on October 14, 2017. The eventual winner in that race was another Republican, former State Representative John Schroder of St.Tammany Parish in suburban New Orleans. Background Riser's grandfather, A. Hartwell Riser, was a city alderman from 1942 to 1950 in Ruston in Lincoln Parish. Riser was born in Columbia to Hartwell Neil Riser, Sr. (1934‚Äì1985), and the former Lillian Marie Gore (born 1937), who married in Caldwell Parish in 1956. After her husband's death, Lillian Riser married Herschel Gentry, Jr., of Monroe. Neil Riser graduated in 1980 from Caldwell Parish High School in Columbia. Located south of Monroe in northeastern Louisiana, Columbia was also the home of Governor John McKeithen and McKeithen's son, Louisiana Secretary of State W. Fox McKeithen.

Riser hence ran for the Louisiana Senate's 32nd district, based in the northeast portion of the state. In the open nonpartisan blanket primary, Riser ranked first with 49 percent of the vote and fell just short of an outright victory. Riser attributed his success to \\"a good grassroots system that helped us. We did it one vote at a time...We truly were able to win against an embedded political system.\\" In the November general election, Riser defeated former State Representative Bryant Hammett, a Democrat from Concordia Parish. Hammett, a former chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, was the outgoing secretary of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries under Governor Kathleen Babineaux Blanco.The News Star - www.thenewsstar.com - Monroe, LA Riser defeated Hammett 55-45 percent.http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=392421 Riser is the first Republican since Reconstruction to have won this Senate seat. John Henry Baker of Delhi was the first Republican to have sought the seat, but in the general election held on February 1, 1972, Baker fell well short of victory. In 2011, Riser won re-election to a second term unopposed.http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=738365 Tenure The 32nd district included Catahoula, Concordia, Caldwell, Franklin, La Salle, and West Feliciana parishes and portions of Avoyelles, Ouachita, Rapides, and Richland parishes. Riser promised to file legislation to roll back the state income tax hike that became law when voters approved the Stelly Plan, named for former Republican State Representative Vic Stelly of Lake Charles. The rollback took effect early in 2009. Riser maintains that voters were misled when they ratified the Stelly Plan, which cut certain taxes and raised others.The Ouachita Citizen: News: Riser announces candidacy for Senate District 32 Riser vowed from the onset to work with Governor Jindal \\"to move our state and our region forward.\\" He indicated that he would work to reduce the tax burden on businesses and families.

Alexander announced on August 6, that he would not seek a seventh term in the office that he had held since 2003 and then a day later confirmed that he would resign the House seat effective September 27 to join the administration of then Governor Bobby Jindal. Riser declared himself \\"100 percent in the race. It's a decision I'd already made. I already represent ten of the twenty-four parishes in the district; so I‚Äôm confident I have a connection with the people in it and with their conservative priorities. Riser was endorsed by U.S. Representatives John C. Fleming of Louisiana's 4th congressional district, Charles Boustany of Louisiana's 3rd congressional district and Steve Scalise of Louisiana's 1st congressional district. Riser's congressional campaign was managed by Timmy Teepell of OnMessage, Inc., of Alexandria, Virginia. Teepell was chief of staff to Governor Jindal during much of Jindal's first term and remains a close advisor to the governor. Riser finished first in a field of fourteen candidates from all parties in the special election held on October 19. He led in fourteen of the twenty-four parishes in the district, mostly by plurality. He received just under 32 percent of the vote. Vance McAllister ranked second with 18 percent. The two met in the runoff election held on November 16. In the first round of balloting, McAllister had led only in his native West Carroll Parish and Richland Parish, finishing a strong second in Ouachita Parish, where he operates a pipeline construction company, runs multiple Subway franchises, and promotes wrestling events. He was endorsed by Louisiana celebrity Phil Robertson of the A&E; Network's Duck Dynasty television series, filmed in West Monroe. Robertson said the fact that McAllister has the least political experience is a factor in his favor. McAllister narrowly edged Jamie Mayo, who received 15 percent of the vote, for the second runoff berth. Mayo is the mayor of Monroe and an African-American Democrat.http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=782843 For the runoff contest, Mayo endorsed McAllister as \\"more approachable\\" than Riser. McAllister also had the support of Republican Clyde Holloway, who ran fourth in the primary election. Though the district reaches south into the Florida Parishes, the top two runoff candidates came from adjoining Caldwell and Ouachita parishes in north Louisiana, close to Alexander's Jackson Parish, which supported McAllister, instead of Alexander's preferred successor, Riser. In the runoff, Riser carried ten of the twenty-four parishes, four fewer than he had in the first round of balloting. McAllister led Riser, 54,449 (59.7) to 36,837 (40.3 percent), with all 981 precincts reporting. After the married McAllister was caught on his office security video kissing his congressional aide, he announced in April 2014, that he would not seek a full House term in the primary scheduled for November 4. He then hesitated about the decision, reversing himself afterward. Despite that, Riser confirmed that he would not run again for the congressional seat. Those in the race for the full term included Monroe Mayor Mayo once again, Republican physician Ralph Abraham, former Grant Parish District Attorney Ed Tarpley, Monroe attorney Harris Brown, and Public Service Commissioner Clyde C. Holloway. Mayo and Abraham met in the runoff,Edwards earns runoff spot; kiss McAllister goodbye, Associated Press, Kevin McGill, November 5, 2014. Retrieved 7 November 2014. with Abraham emerging the easy winner. State police retirement controversy On July 2, 2014, Riser pushed through an amendment on the last day of the legislative session which would have increased by $55,000 annually the retirement pay of Colonel Mike Edmonson, the superintendent of the Louisiana State Police and a Republican appointee of Governor Jindal. Another state trooper from Houma would also inadvertently been similarly affected by Riser's amendment. Legislative rules prohibit a conference committee report from being considered on the last day of a session. However, both chambers voted by the two-thirds majority to suspend the rules and pass Riser's amendment, which became known in the media as the \\"Edmonson Act\\". Louisiana State Treasurer John Neely Kennedy has urged the state police retirement board, of which he is an ex officio member, to litigate the constitutionality of Senate Bill 294, which was promptly signed into law by Jindal. Though he had first denied authorship of the amendment, Riser said that he was asked to submit the measure to the full legislature by Charles Dupuy, the deputy police superintendent. Riser said it was his understanding that the bill in question addresses the rights of law enforcement officers and \\"broad retirement issues\\", not specific individuals who could benefit from its provisions. Meanwhile, the late government watchdog and Hammond attorney C. B. Forgotston claimed that Riser's amendment would have applied to \\"hundreds of thousands\\" of current and future retirees in all departments of state government and would have increased taxpayer liability by millions of dollars in additional accrued expenses. Forgotston said that Riser flatly lied to him in first denying the authorship of the amendment. \\"Riser has now said, ‚ÄòYeah, it was me ...' He should have apologized to the public. He should have apologized to the other five members of the conference committee. He threw them under the bus. He definitely owes an apology to his staff member - he threw her under the bus.\\" On September 16, 2014, Forgotston and Ruston journalist Tom Aswell, who broke the story, were vindicated when Janice Clark, a state court judge in Baton Rouge, declared the \\"Edmonson Act\\" unconstitutional. The successful suit challenging the law was brought forward by State Senator Dan Claitor, an unsuccessful Republican candidate for Louisiana's 6th congressional district seat in the November 4 primary election. Chairmanship of Senate Labor Committee Riser ran unopposed for reelection to his third and final term in the state Senate in the October 24, 2015, primary election. Riser is chairman of the Labor Committee. He announced his opposition to any measure to increase the minimum wage in Louisiana, a priority of Democratic Governor John Bel Edwards, who seeks an $8.25 starting wage. Riser has taken no position on Edwards' call for state legislation to require equal pay for women. Running for the state House of Representatives, 2019 Term-limited in the state Senate in the nonpartisan blanket primary scheduled for October 12, 2019, Riser is instead expected to qualify for the District 20 seat in the Louisiana House of Representatives being vacated by the two-term Republican Steve Pylant of Franklin Parish, who along with Republican John Stephens of LaSalle Parish and possibly Democratic state Representative Andy Anders of Concordia Parish, may contest Riser's seat.Sam Hanna, Jr., \\"Who Wants to Serve?\\", The Colfax Chronicle, January 31, 2019, p. 4.

The parish also contains the similarly-named village of Curbridge. The village has a small school. The parish is located eight miles to the east of Southampton and had a population of 1,292 people in 473 households in the 2001 census, the population increasing to 1,398 in 520 households at the 2011 Census. Curdridge is also known for its annual Curdridge Country Show that takes place in a field off Reading Room Lane Geography The village of Curdridge itself is 2.0 km (1.25 mi) northeast of Botley, and is on the B3051 road. The A334 passes through the southern portion of the parish. Travelling from west to east the A334 enters the parish as it crosses the River Hamble near Botley. It exits the parish, 1.75 km (1.09 mi) later as it crosses Kitnocks Gully immediately east of Lake Road. The B3051 forks off the A334 100m northeast of Botley railway station. The B3051 carries on in a generally northeast direction for approximately 2.9 km (1.8 mi) exiting the parish 100m northeast of Harfield Bungalow. Within the parish the B3051 is named Botley Road. Curdbridge Lane is a road, generally wider than 4m, which crosses the parish west to east. Curdbridge Lane begins at the B3051 junction with Calcott Lane. Curdbridge Lane passes The Cricketers Public House, crosses the course of an old Roman road and marks the boundary of the parish for approximately 190 m (620 ft), before it makes a complete change of direction and leaves the parish at Yew Tree Farm. http://streetmap.co.uk/idld.srf?x=452503&y;=111496&z;=120&sv;=452503,111496&st;=4&mapp;=idld.srf&dn;=826&ax;=452503&ay;=111496&lm;=0 Governance The village is part of the civil parish of Curdridge and is part of the Owslebury and Curdridge ward of the City of Winchester non- metropolitan district of Hampshire County Council. Folklore and local legends The local legends of two women with tragic lives are often mixed and confused in the village's folklore. Kitty Nocks According to local legend, Kitnocks Hill, on the Wickham road, takes its name from a young girl called Kitty Nocks, or some variation thereof, who drowned, either by suicide or accident while eloping with a lover of whom her father did not approve. Her ghost, reportedly seen by locals returning from Southampton on the bus, is now said to haunt the top of the hill. Kate Hunt According to local legend, Mill Hill on the Botley road was, in the 17th century, home to an elderly witch called Kate Hunt, who moved felled trees with magic, rode to Bishops Waltham on a farm gate and changed into a white hare. The elderly woman was found dead after locals from Pink Mead Farm shot the hare with a silver coin.

It is apparent when the same modality (e.g. visual) is used for various types of information within the same display. Users must split their attention between the materials, for example, an image and text, to understand the information being conveyed. The split-attention effect can occur physically though visual and auditory splits and temporally when time distances two pieces of information that should be connected. A visual example of split attention Consider the graphic below from Tarmizi and Sweller. They used these graphics to compare the learning that takes place given split attention conditions. Each is a possibility of how one might arrange graphical material within a lesson. Ward and Sweller advise instructional designers to be careful when they direct a learner's attention. Sweller and his associates found that learners had difficulty following some worked examples if they included diagrams that were separated from their formulas. In several studies and over a variety of experiments, they found that learners using integrated diagrams were better able to process that information, and significantly improved their performance relative to their peers. The split-attention effect is not limited to geometry. Chandler and Sweller found that this effect extends to a variety of other disciplines, due to it being a limitation in human information processing. This overload is the result of high visual cognitive load due to poor instructional design. By simply integrating formulas with diagrams, learners found it easier to integrate and process both forms of visual information and in turn they performed significantly better. center The figure on the left side of the image produces the split-attention effect, while the figure on the right enhances learning because it guides the learner's attention through the worked example. Unincorporated visual displays of information, such as the image above, can be distracting and confusing for the user, aside from producing the split-attention effect. The split-attention effect is an important form of extraneous cognitive load that instructional material designers should avoid. Visual split-attention Chandler and Sweller found through empirical study that the integration of text and diagrams reduces cognitive load and facilitates learning. They found that the split-attention effect is evident when learners are required to split their attention between different sources of information (e.g., text and diagrams). A study done in 1979 by Egan and Schwartz revealed the importance of chunking in the recall process of symbolic images. Chunking has been proven to be a successful aid in long-term memory and image recall. Egan and Schwartz's study also suggests that chunking cannot adequately be implemented when the information and an image produce a split- attention effect. Split attention is important evidence of the cognitive load theory as it demonstrates that the working memory load of instructional materials is important in the design of instructional materials. Chandler and Sweller also found that students viewing integrated instruction spent less time processing the materials and outperformed students in the split attention condition. Pociask and Morrison found in another study that integrated materials resulted in higher test scores and reduces extraneous cognitive load. Deaf and hard of hearing students often experience and struggle with the visual split-attention effect. Because deaf and hard of hearing students need to focus their attention on the teacher or an interpreter, the student is forced to divide their attention between the instructor and the learning material. Deaf and hard of hearing students are most likely to have the best experience in class and ease the effects of a split attention if they have a complete view of the classroom. The split-attention effect not only affects a deaf or hard of hearing individual's schoolwork. It affects their daily life as well because visual input is their main source of communication and information about the world around them. Auditory split-attention An auditory split-attention effect can occur when audio material and visual material result in an additional cognitive load. Moreno and Mayer found evidence for auditory split attention when they tested learners with both ambient environmental sounds and music as they learned from instructional materials. Animation is processed in a visual channel but must be converted to the auditory channel. The extraneous cognitive load imposed by music or environmental sounds were not conducive to learning.  Spatial Contiguity Principle  There have been propositions to eliminate the term \\"split- attention effect\\" and replace it with \\"spatial contiguity\\". These phenomena are very similar, however, split-attention conditions do not need to be present in order for the spatial contiguity principle to take effect. The spatial contiguity principle is the idea that corresponding information is easier to learn in a multimedia format when presented close together rather than separate or farther apart.  Redundancy Effect  The redundancy effect has also been linked to the split-attention effect. The redundancy effect is the idea that instruction materials that are not integrated properly produce and present information in a repetitive way, making it more likely to process unnecessary information and increase cognitive load.

The Secretariat is based in Stockholm, Sweden. Organisational Structure The GWP network has more than 3,000 partners in over 170 countries in 13 regions. The Network currently comprises 13 Regional Water Partnerships and 68 accredited Country Water Partnerships, and includes more than 3,000 institutional Partners located in over 170 countries. The 13 regions are: Southern Africa, Eastern Africa, Central Africa, West Africa, the Mediterranean, Central and Eastern Europe, Caribbean, Central America, South America, Central Asia and the Caucasus, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and China. Although the activities are coordinated and supported from the Secretariat, Regional and Country Partnerships manage and govern themselves, and convene stakeholders to address specific issues. The Global Secretariat supports the Executive Secretary, the Technical Committee and other GWP Committees, and the Regional Water Partnerships in governance, finance, communications, planning, and operational management of programmes and administration. In addition, GWP is supported by its Technical Committee which consists of professionals selected for their experience in different disciplines relating to water resources management. The GWP Chair is Howard Bamsey, who took up the position in January 2019. Executive Secretary is Monika Weber-Fahr and the Chair of the GWP Technical Committee is Dr Jerome Delli Priscoli. Its Patrons are Dr. Ismail Serageldin and Margaret Catley-Carlson. the Prince of Orange Willem- Alexander was a Patron until 30 April 2013 when he became King of the Netherlands. In May 2014 Her Excellency Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, President of the Republic of Liberia, became a Patron of GWP. Operations and Actions GWP most important tasks are Capacity Building and Knowledge Sharing. This is done through publications, workshops, training courses, meetings, informal exchanges, and through its IWRM Toolbox website.\\"About Global Water Partnership\\" Global Water Partnership Toolbox The GWP IWRM Toolbox is a free platform and online database on IWRM with local, national, regional, and global case studies and references.

He played quarterback for the Yale University football team in 1890 and 1891 and helped lead the 1891 Yale team to a perfect 13‚Äì0 record and a national championship. He was the head coach of the University of Michigan football team in 1892 and 1893, compiling an overall record of 14‚Äì8 in two years as head coach. Barbour later had a lengthy business career. After spending 17 years with the New York Central Railroad, he joined the Beech-Nut Packing Company in 1910 and established its chewing gum business. He remained with Beech-Nut for 38 years and served as chairman of the board from 1946 to 1948. Early years Barbour was born in Bangor, Maine in 1870. His father, William McLeod Barbour (1827‚Äì1899), was a minister who emigrated from Scotland to the United States in 1851, and became a professor of theology at Yale University. His mother was Eliza A. (Ransom) Barbour, a native of New York. At the time of the 1880 Census, Barbour was ten years old and residing in New Haven, Connecticut with his parents and four older siblings.1880 United States Census; Census Place: New Haven, New Haven, Connecticut; Roll: 105; Family History Film: 1254105; Page: 328A; Enumeration District: 73; Image: 0198. Barbour attended the public schools in New Haven, and subsequently enrolled at the Phillips Exeter Academy. He was the captain of Exeter's football team in 1888. Yale University Barbour attended Yale University and graduated Ph.B. at Yale's Sheffield Scientific School in 1892. While at Yale, he was the quarterback of the Yale Bulldogs football teams of 1890 and 1891. The 1891 Yale team was coached by Walter Camp and included College Football Hall of Fame inductees, Pudge Heffelfinger, Frank Hinkey, Josh Hartwell and Lee McClung. With Barbour as the starting quarterback, the 1891 team finished with a perfect 13‚Äì0 record and a national championship. In November 1891, The New York Times wrote: \\"Barbour has made great improvements since last year, and is one of the best men on the Yale team. He is cool, passes well and sure, uses his signals to good advantage and is an excellent player. He is considered a much superior player to the Harvard quarterback.\\" University of Michigan In 1892, Barbour was hired as the head football coach at the University of Michigan. He was the school's second head football coach. In the three years before Barbour's arrival, Michigan had played a total of 17 games. As the coach of the 1892 Michigan Wolverines football team, Barbour expanded the team's schedule to twelve games and took the team on its first extended road trip to the West. Over the course of a two-week period from October 15 to 29, 1892, Barbour's team played five road games against Wisconsin (a 10‚Äì6 win on the 15th), Minnesota (a 14‚Äì6 loss on the 17th), DePauw (an 18‚Äì0 win on the 22nd), Purdue (a 24‚Äì0 loss on the 24th) and Northwestern (a 10‚Äì8 loss on the 29th). The 1892 team also defeated Chicago, 18‚Äì10, in a game played at Toledo, Ohio, but suffered two losses to Cornell. Barbour returned the following year as the coach of the 1893 Michigan Wolverines football team. The 1893 team improved to 7‚Äì3. The team closed the season with five consecutive wins over Purdue, DePauw, Northwestern, Kansas and Chicago by a combined score of 202 to 24. The team's 72‚Äì6 victory over Northwestern was the team's second highest point total in the first 22 years of the program's history.In 1888, Michigan defeated Albion 76‚Äì4. With the arrival of Fielding H. Yost in 1901, Michigan's \\"Point-a-Minute\\" teams regularly ran up extraordinary point totals, including a 128‚Äì0 win over Buffalo in 1901, a 119‚Äì0 win over Michigan Agricultural in 1902, a 107‚Äì0 win over Iowa in 1902 and a 130‚Äì0 win over West Virginia in 1904. Barbour compiled an overall record of 14‚Äì8 in two years as head coach. He also returned to Michigan in 1894 for part of the season to assist in developing the football team. The 1894 team compiled a 9‚Äì1‚Äì1 record and outscored its opponents by a combined score of 244 to 84. At Yale, Barbour had played for Walter Camp, regarded as the \\"Father of American Football.\\" At Michigan, Barbour was credited with bringing the \\"Yale methods\\" to Michigan and laying the foundation for the championship teams that followed in 1894 and 1895. In 1900, a student publication called The Inlander summarized Barbour's legacy as follows: > \\"In 1893 Frank Barbour, an old Yale quarterback, coached Michigan and taught > the men, who afterward made Michigan famous, Yale methods. He was not a > great coach in every sense of the term, but he knew the game and had a class > of apt scholars. From him Michigan learned the style of interference which, > with the right kind of men, has always been successful. From him 'Jimmie' > Baird learned the quarterback's duties so well that in the end the pupil > undoubtedly passed the teacher.\\" Business career Barbour also had a lengthy career in business. He was associated with the New York Central & Hudson Valley Railroad from 1892 to 1909. He worked as a traffic clerk for the New York Central Railroad and lived in Montreal, Quebec, Canada from 1892 to 1898.In various passport applications completed by Barbour, available as public records through ancestry.com, Barbour stated that he resided in Montreal from 1892 to 1898 and from 1902 to 1907. He also served for a time as a passenger agent for the Rutland Railway, which was owned by the New York Central Railroad, in Rutland, Vermont. In 1898, he was appointed as traveling agent for the railroad. In 1902, he was appointed general agent of the passenger department of the New York Central & Hudson River R.R. at Montreal, where he resided for a second time from 1902 to 1907. Barbour's brother had been involved in founding American Chicle Company, the originator of Chiclets. In 1910, Barbour went into business with his brother-in-law, Bartlett Arkell, who had founded the Beech-Nut Packing Company. Until that time, Beech-Nut had been a producer of high-grade foodstuffs. On Barbour's recommendation, Beech-Nut entered the chewing gum business. Barbour traveled extensively in Guatemala, Honduras, British Honduras (now known as Belize) and the Yucat√°n to procure the company's supply of chicle, the rubbery sap of the sapota tree that was the key ingredient in chewing gum. Barbour served as a director of Beech-Nut from 1910 to 1948 and became vice president in 1921. Chewing gum eventually became Beech-Nut's most successful product, providing $11 million of the company's $18 million in sales in 1935. As of 1925, Barbour and Arkell were the vice president and president, respectively, of Beech-Nut. In 1946, following Arkell's death, Barbour was elected as the chairman of the board of Beech-Nut. In addition to his work with Beech-Nut, Barbour also served as a vice president and director of the Utica Mutual Insurance Co., and as vice president and director of the Montgomery Electric Light & Power Co., which provided electricity to Palatine Bridge, Canajoharie, Sharon Springs, Ames and Cherry Valley, New York. Marriage and death In September 1908, Barbour married Bertelle Arkelle Gillam in Canajoharie, New York. She had previously been married to the noted cartoonist, Bernhard Gillam, who died in 1896. At the time of the 1910 Census, Barbour and his wife were residing in Canajoharie, and Barbour listed his occupation as vice president of a packing plant.1910 United States Census; Census Place: Canajoharie, Montgomery, New York; Roll: T624_994; Page: 9B; Enumeration District: 0072; Image: 141; FHL Number: 1375007. Barbour resided in Canajoharie for the next 38 years. They lived in a stone home of East Hill in Canajoharie; the house was built in 1888 by Senator and Mrs. James Arkell, the parents of Barbour's wife. The home had extensive grounds and was considered \\"one of the beauty spots of the Mohawk valley.\\" Barbour died on February 4, 1948 at his home in Canajoharie. He was survived by his wife, Bertelle, and his brother, James R. Barbour. According to his will probated in Montgomery County Surrogate's Court in December 1948, Barbour left an estate of $1,308,151. Barbour's wife created the Arkell Hall Foundation which funded the Arkell Museum and provides residential and community facilities for the senior population in Canajoharie.

The flagship of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company, it primarily operates on the Douglas to Heysham route. History Ben-my-Chree in previous livery Ben-my-Chree was ordered in 1997 by Sea Containers for the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company. Costing around ¬£24 million, she was built by van der Giessen de Noord of the Netherlands and launched on 4 April 1998. The sixth vessel to carry the name, she is registered in Douglas, Isle of Man. Ben-my-Chree entered service on 5 July 1998, Tynwald Day - the Isle of Man's national holiday. At a gross tonnage of around 12,000, she was the largest ship to enter service with the company. The vessel received criticism due to her low passenger capacity of 500 (carrying no more than 350 per sailing), and the fact she had no open deck for passengers. The company insisted this was a \\"comfort level\\" for the vessel's size. In 2004, the vessel underwent a refit carried out by Cammell Laird to increase passenger capacity with the addition of a new passenger module. In 2014, Ben-my-Chree underwent a ¬£1.6 million refit which included new LED lighting fitted to the lounge areas, refitted the crew rest area, this was also carried out by Cammell Laird. Incidents Ben-my-Chree entering Douglas Harbour Ben-my-Chree approaching Heysham Port On 25 July 2008, Ben-my-Chree suffered a technical failure, with the Viking taking her Heysham sailing until she was repaired. On 26 March 2010, Ben-my- Chree experienced unintended movement while berthed at Heysham Port, resulting in a walkway collapse, trapping eight people in the gangway compartment of the shore access structure; they were assisted in leaving by the fire service.https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/547c6fb7e5274a4290000049/BenMyChreeReport.pdf On the evening of 1 May 2013 when arriving in Douglas Harbour from Heysham, Ben-my-Chree struck part of the King Edward Pier linkspan. In the collision part of the ship was slightly damaged, meaning the evening departure to Heysham was delayed by two hours, with the Manannan arriving from Liverpool as replacement. The service arrived at Heysham only around thirty minutes late. Ben-my-Chree re-entered service the following day with a freight-only service to Heysham, and full service from that point onwards. In December 2011, the Ben-my-Chree suffered a number of cancelled sailings due to high winds and a problem with a bow thruster that had been damaged in May that year. Arrangements to dry dock the ship in June and then in September had to be cancelled after the manufacturers, Wartsilla, failed to complete the necessary repairs. Chief executive of the Steam Packet Company wrote to the local newspaper, the Manx Independent to express the company's frustration at the ongoing problems. On 12 February 2015, Ben-my-Chree lost control and collided with a fishing boat, while entering Douglas Harbour. The vessel's stern made contact with Battery Pier and a fishing boat at its mooring. It was found that the ship and the fishing boat only suffered superficial damage. The ship was checked by divers for signs of damage to the propellers and steering. It was then relocated to the Victoria Pier using a tug boat where passengers disembarked. On 2 May 2015, the morning sailing from Douglas to Heysham and the afternoon return was cancelled. Ben-my-Chree was suffering from a \\"bow thruster... only operating on reduced power\\". On 16 May 2015, there was a suspected chimney stack lagging fire was detected on the 8.45am crossing from Douglas to Heysham. The sailing arrived in Heysham Port around 1 hour late and no passengers or crew were injured. On 12 February 2017, the vessel made contact with the pier at Douglas whilst attempting to moor in high winds on arrival from Birkenhead. and were planned to take over the freight and passenger duties. On 9 April 2017, Ben-my-Chree suffered an engine failure after arriving at Heysham Port. As a result two return crossings were cancelled and the vessel limped back to Douglas on one engine without passengers. Design and construction Ben-my-Chree is a Ro-Pax ferry, largely designed to carry freight, with two vehicle decks (decks 3 and 5) and two passenger accommodation decks (7 and 8). There are 20 four-berth cabins and crew accommodation for 22. Her freight capacity is 200 vehicles (1235m). A refit during her first winter improved passenger accommodation. Reclining chairs were added in the forward and aft lounges and partitions added between the restaurant and bar areas. In 2004, a major refit allowed her to carry a full capacity of 636 passengers. A new accommodation section containing the Legends caf√©/bar, Niarbyl Quiet Lounge and toilets was added. The refit also created an outside deck space and modifications were made to the vessel's stern door. Another refit in April 2008 included a new livery and internal refit. The Royal New Zealand Navy multi-role vessel , based on Ben-my-Chrees design, entered service in 2007. Service On 16 July 2008, Ben-my-Chree completed 10 years of Manx service. She operates primarily on the Douglas to Heysham route, with occasional services to Belfast, Birkenhead and Dublin. As of July 2018, the vessel has been in service for 20 years. Future replacement In March 2013, the chairman of local group TravelWatch, Brendan O‚ÄôFriel, said \\"The Ben is currently mid-way through her life and she is starting now to develop problems of one sort or another. She is not as reliable as she was. A replacement would take two years to build and we are keen to see plans go ahead.\\" In Issue 17 of the company newsletter, Steam Packet Times, Chief Executive Mark Woodward explained that \\"Now that the refinancing has been completed we have begun the process of assessing the longer term - it is clear that the most significant investment in the coming years will be replacement vessels for Ben-my-Chree and Manannan.\\" In May 2016, the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company outlined plans to replace the Ben-my- Chree as part of their proposed Strategic Sea Services offer to the Isle of Man Government. Under the proposal, the 1998-built Ben-my-Chree would be \\"replaced by 2019‚Äì2021\\" with a new build vessel that would be 140-metres long and have a capacity of 800 passengers. The Ben-my-Chree would then be retained as a third vessel to offer cover to the fleet.

He later became a physician and surgeon in Rochester, New York. He was a pioneer in early surgical procedures to construct artificial vaginas and published an article on the subject in 1915. Early years Ward was born in Rochester, New York in August 1874. His grandfather, Levi Ward, was the mayor of Rochester. His father, Frank Addison Ward, was a Rochester native, a Princeton alumnus, and the chief executive of Ward's Natural Science Establishment, a company that supplied natural history specimens to colleges, museums and collectors in the United States and Europe. Ward's mother, Mary Hawley Douglas, was also a native of New York. He had seven younger siblings born between 1879 and 1894.Ancestry.com. 1900 United States Federal Census [database on-line]. Census Place: Rochester Ward 6, Monroe, New York; Roll: T623_1074; Page: 7A; Enumeration District: 50. Ward attended preparatory school at St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire. Princeton Ward enrolled at Princeton University, where he played football and baseball. He played at the left halfback position for the Princeton Tigers football team in 1893 and at quarterback in 1894. He scored the only touchdown in Princeton's 6‚Äì0 victory over Yale on Thanksgiving Day 1893. In December 1894, The New York Times wrote: Ward received a bachelor of arts degree from Princeton in 1895, and was one of only seven students in Princeton's Class of 1895 to graduate magna cum laude. He was voted the \\"Best All-Round Man in the Class, the \\"Best All-Round Athlete,\\" the \\"Most Awkward Man,\\" and the \\"Latin Salutatorian.\\" Lawrenceville After graduating from Princeton, Ward spent a year as a teacher in Lawrenceville, New Jersey. He also returned to Princeton during the fall of 1895 as an assistant coach for the Princeton football team. While at Lawrenceville, he sought \\"to impart into growing youth the mathematical idea, also the rudiments of foot-ball, and the truth of truths that there is no University in the country like Princeton.\\" He later wrote, \\"Teaching, somehow, did not satisfy me: in fact, even before I left college I had an idea that I might be a doctor some day.\\" In another piece, he noted that he \\"tried for a year to instill Princeton ideas, along with a little knowledge into the heads of the younger generation. The work was pleasant and I was associated with some fine men; but medicine is to be my vocation.\\" University of Michigan Ward attended the medical school at the University of Michigan from 1896 to 1897. He also served as the head football coach for the 1896 Michigan Wolverines football team. He was assisted in coaching the team by William McCauley (during the month of October), Keene Fitzpatrick and James Robinson. He led the team to a 9‚Äì1 record, outscoring opponents 262 to 11. The team went undefeated and allowed only four points in its first nine games, including victories over Michigan Normal (18‚Äì0), Grand Rapids High School (44‚Äì0), Physicians & Surgeons of Chicago (28‚Äì0), Rush Lake Forest (66‚Äì0), Purdue (16‚Äì0), Lehigh (40‚Äì0), Minnesota (6‚Äì4), Oberlin (10‚Äì0), and Wittenberg (28‚Äì0). The final game of the season was a 7‚Äì6 loss to the University of Chicago at Chicago Coliseum, in front of 8,000 fans. Ward later summarized his year at Michigan: He added that the medical program at Michigan was very good, and their laboratories \\"especially fine.\\" While at Michigan, he was elected into the fraternity of Psi Upsilon. With respect to fraternity life, Ward wrote: \\"The boys were very good to me there and among other things elected me a member of the Psi Upsilon fraternity. There was a nice set of boys in the chapter and I used to have my room at the chapter house. It made life at Ann Arbor much more pleasant than it would have been, and I enjoyed the fraternity life, though I still rejoice that we don't indulge at Princeton.\\" In another article, Ward wrote, \\"One year in the West was enough for me.\\" Penn In 1897, Ward enrolled in the medical school at the University of Pennsylvania. Ward received his M.D. from Penn in 1899. While at Penn, he was a member of Psi Upsilon and the H.C. Wood Medical Society. As he had done at Michigan, Ward followed in the footsteps of William \\"Jerry\\" McCauley. Both were Princeton football players who coached football at Michigan and received their medical degrees at Penn. Ward later wrote, \\"At Pennsylvania, too, 'Jerry' McCauley had been my forerunner, and he it was who took me around to see Dr. Joe upon the very day of my arrival in Philadelphia, and from that time until I left Philadelphia, in March, 1902, after a winter's special training with him, he was my friend and instructor; and if I ever make a name for myself in the domain of surgery it is his training that I have to thank for it. Many a morning would find me standing beside his operating table instead of on the benches of the lecture room where I belonged, but I have never repented my choice.\\" Medical career In 1902, Ward established a general medical practice at Rochester, New York. In 1905, he wrote an article on \\"A Doctor's Life\\" in which he noted: He became prominent as a physician and surgeon in Rochester. He was a surgeon at Rochester General Hospital and a member of the Rochester Medical Association and the Rochester Athletic Club. In 1905, he published an article titled, \\"The Possibility of Clean Obstetrical Work in the Slums,\\" in \\"American Medicine.\\" In 1910, Ward presented a paper to the Medical Society of the State of New York titled, \\"General Peritonitis ‚Äì Shall We Ask Nature to do Her Own Surgery?\\" In 1915, he published an article titled \\"The Construction of an Artificial Vagina With Establishment of the Menstrual Function\\" in the journal, Surgery, Gynecology and Obstetrics. He wrote the article after studying attempts by doctors in Germany and the United States to construct artificial vaginas and after successfully performing the surgery on a 13-year-old girl at Rochester General Hospital. Ward became an advocate of the procedure and wrote: Ward served overseas in World War I, and later served as a surgeon at the Park Avenue Clinical Hospital and was a member of the Medical Advisory Board and the New York State Selective Draft Service. Family and later years On May 10, 1905, Ward was married to Anne Marie Devine. At the time of the 1910 United States Census, Ward was living with his wife in Rochester, New York. They had twin sons born April 30, 1906, though one of the sons died in infancy. The surviving son was Francis Bernard Ward.

It was first published in paperback by Ace Books in 1966. The author afterwards revised and expanded the text, in which form it was reissued as Thongor and the Dragon City, first published in paperback by Berkley Books in 1970. This retitled and revised edition became the standard edition for later reprintings. Plot and storyline To rescue Princess Sumia and save her city, barbarian adventurer Thongor of Valkarth challenges the vampire-king Xothun, who has ruled the lost city of Omm for a thousand years. Cover art from the first edition of the retitled and revised version, Thongor and the Dragon City, Berkley Books, 1970. Setting The Thongor series is Carter's premier entry in the Sword & Sorcery genre, representing a tribute to both the Conan series of Robert E. Howard and the Barsoom novels of Edgar Rice Burroughs. He pictures the lost continent of Lemuria as a prehistoric kingdom located in the Pacific Ocean during the Ice Age, where Mesozoic wildlife persisted after the cataclysm wiped them out elsewhere. An intelligent reptilian humanoid race descended from dinosaur reigned supreme as the dominant life form but was partially supplanted by humanity as the continent was colonized by fauna from outside Lemuria. Humans have gradually thrown off their subjection by the older civilization. Culturally, Lemuria is a mixture of civilization and barbarism but overall is precociously advanced over the outside world, boasting a magic-based technology that includes even flying machines. The Thongor books relate the struggle of the titular hero to unite the humans of Lemuria into a single empire and complete the overthrow of the \\"dragon kings\\". Influence The Thongor books helped reestablish the sword and sorcery genre in the 1960s. Thongor was a successful ongoing series, paving the way for an explosion of similar works by other hands. It inspired such spin-offs as a comic book series and a rock group. After Carter was recruited by L. Sprague de Camp to assist in continuing Howard's original Conan series, however, his interest in Thongor waned. Ultimately the Thongor saga remained unfinished and was already out of print well before the author's death. As of September 2016, author and long-time friend of Lin Carter Dr. Robert M. Price released a collected edition of original Thongor stories with an introduction by Richard A. Lupoff.https://www.amazon.com/Sword-Thongor- Robert-M- Price/dp/1605439061/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1490502145&sr;=8-1&keywords;=Thongor Price states, \\"In the last few years, I have taken up the fallen banner of Lin Carter‚Äôs Thongor of Lemuria saga. Lin appointed me his literary executor, and so I feel that carrying on Thongor‚Äôs adventures is within my prerogative.\\"http://www.robertmprice.mindvendor.com/fiction.htm Price has also informed Thongor fans on social media that he has planned more Thongor of Lemuria stories to come in the near future. Marvel Comics adaptation The book was the basis for the beginning of a Marvel Comics storyline in the comic book Creatures on the Loose. Thongor debuted in issue 22 in March 1973, and the storyline ran through issue 29 in May 1974. Reception Robert M. Price writes \\"[t]he Lemurian books pulse with a color and vitality that we miss in many of Lin Carter's later works. ... Yet to his relative inexperience we may also lay the blame for certain inconsistencies and failures to reckon with the implications of what he has written.\\" Among these he notes \\"Thongor eating dates from the East as if he were in Europe\\" and \\"hail[ing] from [Lemuria's] wintry North,\\" when, with the continent \\"south of the Equator, it would get hotter the further north you went!\\"Price, Robert M. \\"Thongor's Saga.\\" Chapter in Lin Carter: A Look Behind His Imaginary Worlds.

Building Designed by George Coles and commissioned and built by Phillip and Sid Hyams, the cinema opened in 1937. The Gaumont State was one of the biggest auditoria in Europe, with seating for 4,004 people. The name State is said to come from the huge tower, inspired by the Empire State Building in New York City. The exterior of the cinema is designed in an Art Deco Italian Renaissance style, covered in cream ceramic tiles. The tower, designed in the style of a 1930s New York skyscraper, can be seen for miles around, and bears the name \\"STATE\\" in large red neon letters. The interior was designed in the opulent style of cinemas of the day, and includes a Wurlitzer organ which is today one of the largest fully functioning Wurlitzer organs in Britain. It is also one of the few cinema organs remaining in their original locations. History Entertainers such as Gracie Fields, Larry Adler and George Formby performed at the official opening broadcast live on BBC Radio on 20 December 1937. Since then, the Gaumont State has been one of the most popular music venues in London and hosted a number of historic performances. From the late 1980s until 2007 the building was run as a bingo hall by Mecca Bingo. In 2007 the bingo was closed, and the building and surrounding site were put up for sale. A campaign to Save the Kilburn State from unsympathetic property developers, and restore it as a cultural centre, was started in the same year by local residents. The building was eventually acquired by Ruach City Church, led by Bishop John Anthony Francis and Co-Pastor Penny Francis. The building was bought 70 years to the exact day that The Gaumont State was first opened on 20 December 1937.

The station is owned by Educational Media Foundation. The station is part of the Alert FM digital alert and messaging system for Lauderdale County first responders. Programming The station is broadcasting a contemporary Christian music format to the Meridian, Mississippi, area. History Butler Broadcasting Corporation received the original construction permit from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1978 for a new FM station broadcasting with 3,000 watts of effective radiated power on 93.5 MHz. The new station was assigned the call letters WQGL by the FCC. On September 11, 1978, the same day the station applied to the FCC for its license to cover, the owners received new call letters WQGL-FM. WQGL-FM received its license to cover from the FCC on July 30, 1979. On April 8, 1992, the station returned to the unadorned WQGL callsign. On May 4, 1995, the FCC granted this station a construction permit to move their transmitter site, raise their antenna, and upgrade their broadcast power to 25,000 watts. These upgrades were completed in May 1997 and the station changed call letters to WKZB on June 9, 1997. In June 2002, Butler Broadcasting Corporation (Darryl Jackson, president) reached an agreement to sell this station to East Mississippi Broadcasters, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Holladay Broadcasting (Bob Holladay, president), for a reported sale price of $771,500. The deal was approved by the FCC on August 16, 2002, and the transaction was consummated on October 30, 2002. At the time of the sale, WKZB broadcast a classic rock music format. This change would prove short-lived as in early December 2003, Holladay Broadcasting' East Mississippi Broadcasters, Inc., agreed to transfer the broadcast license for this station to Holladay Broadcasting-owned Mississippi Broadcasters LLC.

History Launch This station received its original construction permit for a new 3,700 watt FM station broadcasting at 105.9 MHz from the Federal Communications Commission on December 7, 1990. The new station was assigned the call letters WYDH by the FCC on February 1, 1991. WYDH received its license to cover from the FCC on August 7, 1991. In July 1992, original owner Alabama Native American Broadcasting, reached an agreement to sell this station to PCI Communications, Inc. Alabama Native American Broadcasting was a partnership between family members Randy Dale Gehman, Martin Eby Gehman, Vernie L. Gehman, Martin Gerald Gehman, and David Wayne Gehman. The deal was approved by the FCC on August 14, 1992. In October 1994, PCI Communications, Inc., agreed to sell this station to Creek Indian Enterprises. The deal was approved by the FCC on November 15, 1994, and the transaction was consummated on the same day. In December 1997, Creek Indian Enterprises reached an agreement to sell this station to Southern Media Communications, Inc. The deal was approved by the FCC on March 4, 1998, and the transaction was consummated on May 22, 1998. Changing signs Former WNSI branding The station applied for a change in callsigns and was assigned WDXZ by the FCC on April 26, 2004. Less than six months later, on October 4, 2004, the station's call letters were changed again, this time to WNSI-FM. In March 2006, parent company Great American Radio Network, Inc. (Walter Bowen, president) announced an agreement to sell WNSI-FM along with sister stations WNSI and WBCA to Gulf Coast Broadcasting Inc. (R. Lee Hagan, president) for a reported combined sale price of $550,001. At the time of the announcement, WNSI aired a sports/talk radio format. The deal was dismissed at the request of the applicants on May 17, 2006, and the transaction was never consummated so the license remained with Great American Radio Network Inc. Controversy Station owner Walter Bowen made national headlines in 2008 due to a dispute over music licensing with the performance rights organization known as the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. The WNSI and WNSI-FM combo did not itself play music‚Äîthe clips at issue were played during the syndicated Dave Ramsey Show‚Äîand hadn't since a June 2004 switch from country music to talk radio. Bowen, upset by ASCAP's refusal to reduce his licensing fee from about $80 per month to the talk radio rate of $17 per month, stopped paying the fee altogether. Citing the airing of two song clips in September 2006 on the Ramsey program, ASCAP sued Bowen's Great American Radio Network, Inc., for damages. Bowen's attorneys and ASCAP reached a $15,000 settlement with a payment plan but Bowen refused to pay, calling the settlement \\"legal extortion\\". Acquisition by Gulf Coast Broadcasting Former branding In March 2010, the broadcast license for WNSI-FM was involuntarily transferred from Southern Media Communications, Inc., to Lonnie L. Mixon, acting as the Chapter 11 bankruptcy trustee. The station was assigned new call letters WBZR-FM by the FCC on May 4, 2010. In July 2010, the trustee reached an agreement to sell WBZR-FM to Gulf Coast Broadcasting Company, Inc., for $220,000 in settlement of the owner's debts. This bankruptcy sale, along with sister station WBZR, for a combined price of $410,000 is at a significantly reduced from the March 2006 agreement with Gulf Coast for $550,001. The sale was formally consummated on September 27, 2010., following Bowen's conviction for child sex abuse. On November 2, 2010, the station received its license to cover changes completed in 2008 after full repairs to its broadcasting equipment damaged by Hurricane Ivan in 2004.

Family Onslow was born at Imber Court, Thames Ditton, Surrey, the eldest son of the then George Onslow, later the 1st Earl. and Henrietta Shelley, daughter of Sir John Shelley, 4th Baronet and his second wife Margaret Pelham. On 30 December 1776, he married Arabella Mainwaring-Ellerker (d. 1782), by whom he had four children: * Arthur George Onslow, 3rd Earl of Onslow (1777‚Äì1870) * Hon.

In 1784, he left Rye and replaced his father's first cousin, Colonel Onslow, as MP for Guildford upon the retirement of the latter. He continued to represent that constituency until 1806, when he was replaced by his second son, Thomas Cranley. A supporter of the Foxite Whigs, Onslow was, however, little active in the House of Commons, presenting a petition in 1781 on behalf of a \\"body of the innholders of England\\", complaining of the quartering of soldiers upon them. As an associate of the Prince, he was sent to Mrs Fitzherbert to tell her that the Prince had attempted suicide and only she could save his life, and he guarded the door of Fitzherbert's house when she secretly married the prince. However, he later fell out with the Prince, for reasons unknown, voting in favour of Pitt's regency proposal of 1789 and against the abolition of the slave trade in 1796.

Isaacs is president of the institution. Name More than 20 independent organizations were established through the philanthropy of Andrew Carnegie and now feature his surname. They perform work involving topics as diverse as art, education, international affairs, world peace, and scientific research. In 2007, the Carnegie Institution of Washington adopted the public name \\"Carnegie Institution for Science\\" to distinguish itself better from other organizations established by and named for Andrew Carnegie. The institution remains officially and legally the Carnegie Institution of Washington, but now has a public identity that describes its work. History Andrew Carnegie Vannevar Bush. > \\"It is proposed to found in the city of Washington, an institution > which...shall in the broadest and most liberal manner encourage > investigation, research, and discovery [and] show the application of > knowledge to the improvement of mankind...\\" ‚Äî Andrew Carnegie, January 28, > 1902 When the United States joined World War II, Vannevar Bush was president of the Carnegie Institution. Several months before, on June 12, 1940, Bush had been instrumental in persuading President Franklin Roosevelt to create the National Defense Research Committee (later superseded by the Office of Scientific Research and Development) to mobilize and coordinate the nation's scientific war effort. Bush housed the new agency in the Carnegie Institution's administrative headquarters at 16th and P Streets, NW, in Washington, DC, converting its rotunda and auditorium into office cubicles. From this location, Bush supervised, among many other projects, the Manhattan Project. Carnegie scientists cooperated with the development of the proximity fuze and mass production of penicillin.Trefil, James; Margaret Hindle Hazen; Timothy Ferris. Good Seeing. Joseph Henry Press, 2002, pp. 77-79. Research Carnegie scientists continue to be involved with scientific discovery. Composed of six scientific departments on the East and West Coasts, the Carnegie Institution for Science is involved presently with six main topics: Astronomy at the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism (Washington, D.C.) and the Observatories of the Carnegie Institution of Washington (Pasadena, CA and Las Campanas, Chile); Earth and planetary science also at the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism and the Geophysical Laboratory (Washington, D.C.); Global Ecology at the Department of Global Ecology (Stanford, CA); Genetics and developmental biology at the Department of Embryology (Baltimore, MD); Matter at extreme states also at the Geophysical Laboratory; and Plant science at the Department of Plant Biology (Stanford, CA). Department of Embryology In addition to the Department of Embryology, BioEYES is located at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, PA; Monash University in Melbourne, Australia; the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, UT; and the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, IN. Until the 1960s the department's emphasis was human embryo development. Since then the researchers have addressed fundamental questions in animal development and genetics at the cellular and molecular levels. Some researchers investigate the genetic programming behind cellular processes as cells develop, while others explore the genes that control growth and obesity, stimulate stem cells to become specialized body parts, and perform many other functions. Geophysical Laboratory, Washington, D.C. Researchers at the Geophysical Laboratory (GL), founded in 1905, examine the physics and chemistry of Earth's deep interior. The laboratory is world-renowned for petrology‚Äîthe study of rocks. It is known also for high-pressure and high-temperature physics, having made significant contributions to both Earth and material sciences. The GL, with the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism co-located on the same campus, is additionally a member of the NASA Astrobiology Institute‚Äîan interdisciplinary effort to investigate how life evolved on this planet and determine its potential for existing elsewhere. Among their many projects is one dedicated to examining how rocks found at high-pressure, high-temperature hydrothermal vents at the ocean bottom may have provided the catalyst for life on this planet. Research at the Geophysical Laboratory is multidisciplinary and encompasses research from theoretical physics to molecular biology. When the Laboratory was first established, its mission was to understand the composition and structure of the Earth as it was known at the time, including the processes that control them. This included developing an understanding of the underlying physics and chemistry as well as the tools necessary for research. During the history of the Laboratory, this mission has extended to include the entire range of conditions since the Earth's formation. Most recently this study has expanded to cover other planets, both within our own solar system and in other star systems. The Laboratory develops instruments and procedures for examining materials across a wide range of temperatures and pressures ‚Äî everything from near absolute zero to hotter than the sun and from ambient pressure to millions of atmospheres. The Laboratory uses diamond-anvil cells coupled with first-principles theory as research tools. It also develops scientific instrumentation and high-pressure technology used at the national x-ray and neutron facilities that it manages. This work addresses major problems in mineralogy, materials science, chemistry, and condensed-matter physics. Laboratory scientists examine meteorites and comets to follow the evolution of simple to complex molecules in the solar system. They are gaining insights into the origin of life by examining the conditions present in the early Earth. Studying unique ecologies to develop detailed models of their biochemistry helps develop protocols and instrumentation that could assist the search for life on other planets. The protocols and methodologies are tested in regions of the Earth that serve as analogs for conditions found on other planets. As do all Carnegie departments, the Laboratory funds outstanding young scholars through a strong program of education and training at the pre- doctoral and post-doctoral levels. Department of Global Ecology, Stanford, California The Department of Global Ecology was established in 2002. These researchers are researching the complicated interactions of Earth's land, atmosphere, and oceans to understand how global systems operate. With a wide range of instruments‚Äîfrom satellites to the instruments of molecular biology‚Äîthese scientists explore issues such as the global carbon cycle, the role of land and oceanic ecosystems in regulating climate, the interaction of biological diversity with ecosystem function, and more. These ecologists play an active role in the public arena, from giving congressional testimony to promoting satellite imagery for the discovery of environmental hotspots. Department of Plant Biology, Stanford, California Arabidopsis thaliana The Department of Plant Biology began as a desert laboratory in 1903 to study plants in their natural habitats. Over time the research evolved to the study of photosynthesis. Presently, using molecular genetics and related methods, these biologists study the genes responsible for plant responses to light and the genetic controls over various growth and developmental processes including those that enable plants to survive disease and environmental stress. Additionally, the department is a developer of bioinformatics. It developed the Arabidopsis Information Resource, an online-integrated database that supplies biological information on the most widely used model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. The department uses advanced genetic and genomic methods to study the biochemical and physiological basis of the regulation of photosynthesis and has pioneered methods that use genetic sequencing to systematically characterize unstudied genes. It examines life in extreme environments by studying communities of photosynthetic microbes that live in hot springs. Department of Terrestrial Magnetism, Washington, D.C. The Department of Terrestrial Magnetism was founded in 1904. Part of their mission included the use of two ships. The Galilee (ship) was chartered in 1905, but when it proved unsuitable for performing magnetic observations, a nonmagnetic ship was commissioned. The Carnegie (ship) was built in 1909 and completed seven cruises to measure the Earth's magnetic field before it suffered an explosion and burned.Trefil, James; Margaret Hindle Hazen; Timothy Ferris. Good Seeing. Joseph Henry Press, 2002, pp. 133-136. The department funds a number of interdisciplinary research studies. Astronomy and Astrophysics at DTM uses pioneering detection methods to discover and understand planets outside the Solar system. By observing and modeling other planetary systems, researchers are able to apply those implications to our own system. The Geophysics group at DTM studies earthquakes and volcanoes and the Earth's structures and processes that produce them. Cosmochemists study the origins of the Solar system, the early evolution of meteorites and the nature of the impact process on Earth. The Observatories, Pasadena, California, and Las Campanas, Chile Giant Magellan Telescope, artist's conception. The Observatories were founded in 1904 as the Mount Wilson Observatory, which transformed our notion of the cosmos with the discoveries by Edwin Hubble that the universe is much larger than had been thought and that it is expanding. Carnegie astronomers study the cosmos. Unlike most researchers of their topic, they design and build their own instruments. They are tracing the evolution of the universe from the spark of the Big Bang through star and galaxy formation, exploring the structure of the universe, and probing the mysteries of dark matter, dark energy, and the ever-accelerating rate at which the universe is expanding. Carnegie astronomers operate from the Las Campanas Observatory, which was established in 1969. Located high in Chile's Atacama Desert, it affords excellent astronomical observing conditions. As Los Angeles's light encroached more and more on Mount Wilson, day-to-day operations there were transferred to the Mount Wilson Institute in 1986. The newest additions at Las Campanas, twin 6.5-meter reflectors, are remarkable members of the latest generation of giant telescopes. The Carnegie Institution is partnered with several other organizations in constructing the Giant Magellan Telescope. CASE: Carnegie Academy for Science Education and First Light Two CASE Students. In 1989, Maxine Singer, president of Carnegie at that time, founded First Light, a free Saturday science program for middle school students from D.C. public, charter, private, and parochial schools. The program teaches hands-on science, such as constructing and programming robots, investigating pond ecology, and studying the Solar System and telescope building. First Light marked the beginning of CASE, the Carnegie Academy for Science Education. Since 1994 CASE has also offered professional development for D.C. teachers in science, mathematics, and technology. Administration Administrative headquarters of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, DCThe Carnegie Institution's administrative offices are located at 1530 P St., NW, Washington, D.C., at the corner of 16th and P Streets. The building houses the offices of the president, administration and finance, publications, and advancement. Funding for eugenics In 1920 the Eugenics Record Office, founded by Charles Davenport in 1910 in Cold Spring Harbor, New York, was merged with the Station for Experimental Evolution to become the Carnegie Institution's Department of Genetics. The Institution funded that laboratory until 1939; it employed such anthropologists as Morris Steggerda, who collaborated closely with Davenport. The Carnegie Institution ceased its support of eugenics research and closed the department in 1944. The department's records were retained in a university library. The Carnegie Institution continues its funding for legitimate genetic research. Among its notable staff members of that topic are Nobel laureates Andrew Fire, Alfred Hershey, and Barbara McClintock.

Common aquaculture systems requiring optimization and engineering include sea cages, ponds, and recirculating systems. The design and management of these systems is based on their production goals and the economics of the farming operation. Aquaculture technology is varied with design and development requiring knowledge of mechanical, biological and environmental systems along with material engineering and instrumentation. Furthermore, engineering techniques often involve solutions borrowed from wastewater treatment, fisheries, and traditional agriculture. Aquacultural engineering has played a role in the expansion of the aquaculture industry, which now accounts for half of all seafood products consumed in the world. To identify effective solutions the discipline is combined with both fish physiology and business economics unknowledge. Recirculating aquaculture systems Recirculating aquaculture systems often involve intensive, high- density culture of a species with limited water usage and extensive filtration. In a typical recirculating aquaculture system, a series of filtration steps maintains a high level of water quality that promotes rapid fish growth. Steps include solids removal, biofiltration, oxygenation, and pumping, with each one requiring different equipment and engineering considerations. Comprehensive instrumentation and sensor controls are required to monitor this equipment and the underlying water conditions such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH. Development of recirculating aquaculture systems is still underway in 2017, and engineering advances are needed to make the systems economically viable for culturing most species. Research The Journal of Aquacultural Engineering publishes engineers' studies related to the design and development of aquacultural systems. Worldwide, universities provide aquacultural engineering education often under the umbrella of agricultural or biological engineering.

With the rise in globalization, material advantages for indigenous populations have diminished. At times, national governments have negotiated natural resources without taking into account whether or not these resources exist on indigenous lands. In this sense for many indigenous populations, the effects of globalization mirror the effects of the conquest in the mid 16th century. In response, indigenous political movements have emerged in various countries in North and South America. These movements share similarities. Many seek specific rights for indigenous populations. These rights include the right to self-determination and the right to preserve their culture and heritage. Aims differ. One of the main differences is the way in which they organize themselves to meet their objectives. There have been movements in Latin America to unite indigenous populations separated by national borders. The following are examples of groups that have organized in order to be heard on a transnational level. These movements call for indigenous rights to become a universal right to be acknowledged by all countries with indigenous populations. Transnational organizations Coordinator of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon River Basin (COICA) This organization coordinates the following nine national Amazonian indigenous organizations: * Interethnic Association for the Development of the Peruvian Rainforest (AIDESEP) * Amerindian People‚Äôs Association of Guyana (APA) * Confederation of Indigenous people of Bolivia (CIDOB) * Coordination of the Indigenous Organizations of the Brazilian Amazon (COIAB) * Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of the Ecuadorian Amazon (CONFENIAE) * Regional Organization of Indigenous Towns of the Amazon * Federation des Organisations Amerindiennes de Guyane * Organization Van Inheemsen in Suriname * Organization of the Indigenous Towns of the Colombian Amazonia Indian Council of South America (CISA) The Indian Council of South America was founded in 1980. It is a non-governmental organization that works in consultation with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. This council also seeks to maintain relations with international agencies such as UNESCO, FAO, and WHO. One of CISA‚Äôs objectives is to promote respect for the right to life, justice, development, peace, and autonomy of the indigenous peoples and Nations. CISA also coordinates an exchange of knowledge, experiences and projects between indigenous peoples and nations in respect to development that will improve their welfare. International Mayan League One of the most important goals for the International Mayan League is to return to the Mayan balance that was interrupted with the Spanish conquest of 1524. This group, similar to COICA, works to preserve and inform people about the culture of the Mayan people. This group has reached out to other states like Costa Rica and some of the states in the United States in order to carry out activities in the areas of teaching, research, and services. One of the defining factors about this group is that it does not have any formal leadership roles appointed to any one person. Rather, the Mayan League sticks to its ancestral beliefs that all can participate in decision making activity. Some of the problems that the Maya League seeks to combat are racism, repression, marginalization, and poverty. Currently, there is a large population of Maya living in Guatemala. Mexico has the most adapted modern Maya peoples today; they are from Mayan Yucatec branch, most of them totally integrated into the Mexican economy, from peasants, retail, handcraft or \\"Maquiladora\\" factory workers to doctors, engineers and politicians. Belize also has one of the largest populations of Maya peoples. The issues that they face today include the exploitation of their land, such as logging and the oil industry.Giving Meaning to Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, edited by Isfahan Merali, and Valerie Oosterveld, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2001.

Groups within countries have done work to publicize indigenous rights in their respective countries.  Trans-national movements  Transnational movements have helped publicize the indigenous rights movement in Latin America. Trans- national movements regarding indigenous rights could be seen as the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. Many political related movements regarding the rights of indigenous peoples have taken hold particularly in the 1990s due to \\"time and allies.\\" Political collaboration has been integral for the progress of indigenous peoples. Multilateral agencies and NGO's have been helping to increase leverage for indigenous peoples rights. The first Peruvian president of indigenous origin, Alejandro Toledo, was elected in 2001. This marked the first time that someone of Indian descent was the ruler since the 1930s. Transnational organizations have been credited for contributing to Cu√©'s victory in Mexico. The Front of Binational Organizations (FIOB), one of the most active indigenous organizations, is credited for this feat. Trans- national movements like the FIOB \\"represents a broad network of relationships, organizational structures, and cultural traditions.\\" Solidarity is one of the main attributes for the success of trans-national movements. Global trans- national movements also influence regional movements. For example, since the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People was passed, there has been progress made for the indigenous rights movement. Trans-national movements aim to enforce these policies through their work with domestic movements throughout the Americas. One of the newest and most controversial in terms of radical actions, is the Indigenous Democracy Defense Organization or IDDO, https://www.facebook.com/IndigenousDemocracyDefenseOrganization/ it has created an Indigenous all volunteer'Foreign Legion' that has taken the defense of Indigenous rights to unprecedented / albeit still technically legal -levels, in various countries of Latin America, such as training various tribes in front-line zones of criminal activity, such as narco-trafficking areas or conflict zone areas, basic marksmanship community self defense skills, for both genders and for all age groups. This is a Pan-Tribal and Global Indigenous entity created by radical Caribbean Indigenous Rights activist Damon Gerard Corrie - a Barbados born Lokono-Arawak of Guyanese descent, who was one of the Caribbean Indigenous members of the 20 person Hemispheric Indigenous Peoples Working Group at the Organization of American States/OAS from the year 2000 to 2016, that collectively negotiated the American Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples https://www.oas.org/en/sare/documents/DecAmIND.pdf into existence and final adoption by the OAS in 2016. It is the second most important Indigenous Rights declaration after the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and is a document that asserts the rights of the Hemispheres 70 million indigenous peoples. The IDDO was itself an offshoot of the recently created Caribbean Amerindian Development Organization/CADO https://www.facebook.com/caribbeanamerindiandevelopmentorganisation/that was the brainchild of Damon Gerard Corrie and Shirling Simon of the Lokono of Barbsados and Guyana, Roberto Borrero and Tai Pellicier of the Taino of Puerto Rico, and Irvince and Florence Auguiste of the Kalinago of Dominica. CADO is the most geographically diverse Indigenous NGO in the Caribbean with Taino membership in Cuba, Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, Kalinago membership in Dominica and Saint Vincent, Lokono membership in Barbados and Guyana, Makushi membership in Amazonia, Kuna membership in the San Blas islands in the far western Caribbean Sea, and Embera membership in Panama Central America. Transnational movements have shifted their focus towards environmental rights. As deforestation occurs in areas such as the Amazon, many movements aim to work in solidarity to bring these secondary issues to light. Amazon Watch is one non-governmental organization that aims to publicize the plight of deforestation in the Amazon in regards to the lives of indigenous peoples. Oil drilling is one issue that Amazon Watch fights against. A pipeline spill in the Peruvian Amazon highlights the plight of indigenous protests. Five indigenous communities sought to remediate the polluted sites and gain compensation for damages to their land. This shift has helped to gain more awareness as environmental protection becomes more important in the rights for indigenous peoples. The Dakota Access Pipeline protests is one example of the fight for indigenous rights to sacred land in the United States. More than 40% of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe live below the poverty line and this pipeline could negatively affect both the environment and well-being of the tribe.  Brazil  = Background = Indigenous rights have largely been ignored throughout Brazil's history. They were considered \\"second-class citizens\\" and much of their land was taken away for economic development. Brazilian is also historically known for the \\"physical and cultural extermination of the indigenous peoples.\\" However, the indigenous movement in Brazil has largely grown since the 1980s. Although policies have been changed to include the rights of the indigenous peoples, it ignores the collective right to their land.  Cases  The 2002 Xucuru case in Brazil highlights the role of the state in the struggle of present-day indigenous peoples in Brazil. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights was asked to safeguard Marcos de Ara√∫jo, after they received death threats regarding their right to indigenous land. The state rejected this request because of various reasons. Much of the Indian rights movement in Brazil focus on right to land, and not individual liberties. Although indigenous tribes are marginalized and largely unrepresented in government, Brazil's Articulation of Indigenous People's have staged protests around major cities in Brazil to focus on fighting for territorial rights of the native peoples. The result of this issue shows that \\"constitutional recognition of indigenous human rights and a multicultural and collectivist perspective does not eliminate the legal and political obstacles to implementing those rights.\\" See also * Pan-Indianism * List of indigenous rights organizations * Indigenous Peoples of the Americas * Zapatista Army of National Liberation References External links * weblinkCOICA.html * News for Everyone - * 0017.html * Juan Houghton and Beverly Bell, \\"Latin American Indigenous Movements in the Context of Globalization\\" Americas Program (Silver City, NM: Interhemispheric Resource Center, October 11, 2004).

During this time he developed DBSolve, a software for mathematical stimulation and analysis of the cellular metabolism and regulation (Goryanin is an author for DBSolve). From 1989 to 1995 he was also CEO and co-founder of Biobank Inc., Russia. In 1995‚Äì1997 Goryanin worked as a Visiting Computer Scientist at the Mathematics & Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratories. He joined GlaxoSmithKline (formerly known as GlaxoWellcome) in 1997. Igor was working on application of modelling and informatics techniques to the pharmaceutical research and development and drugs manufacturing industry. The whole cell modelling of organisms approach developed by Igor has been successfully used to improve drug R&D; and manufacturing process in production plants. i.e. designing anti-microbial assays and anti-microbial drug targets identification, rational organism design, rational biomarker design and target prioritisation, reconstructing cellular networks for cancers, metabolic and lipid disorders. In 2005 Goryanin moved to Edinburgh to take the position of a Henrik Kacser Chair in Computational Systems Biology. In 2006 Goryanin developed one of the first Masters courses in Computational Systems Biology in the UK, currently taught at the University of Edinburgh. He co-founded the Centre for Systems Biology at Edinburgh, where he was a co-director (2006‚Äì2010), and Edinburgh Centre for Bioinformatics, where he was a director (2005‚Äì2010).

Iconography The combination of a life-sized portrait of Elizabeth I with a landscape format is \\"quite unprecedented in her portraiture\\",Strong 1987, Gloriana, p. 130‚Äì133 although allegorical portraits in this format, such as the Family of Henry VIII: An Allegory of the Tudor Succession (1572) attributed to Lucas de Heere,Hearn, Dynasties, p. 81 pre-date the Armada Portrait. English art in this period was isolated from trends in Catholic Italy, and owed more to Flemish manuscript illumination and heraldic representation than to Renaissance ideas of unity in time and space in art. The 'Armada Portrait' is no exception: the chair to the right is viewed from two different angles, as are the tables on the left, and the background shows two different stages in the defeat of the Armada. In the background view on the left, English fireships threaten the Spanish fleet, and on the right the ships are driven onto a rocky coast amid stormy seas by the \\"Protestant Wind\\". On a secondary level, these images show Elizabeth turning her back on storm and darkness while sunlight shines where she gazes, iconography that would be repeated in Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger's 1592 \\"Ditchley\\" portrait of the queen. Personal device of Charles V, Seville city hall The queen's hand rests on a globe below a crown (probably not the state crown), \\"her fingers covering the Americas, indicating England's dominion of the seas and plans for imperialist expansion in the New World\\".Hearn, Dynasties, p. 88Andrew Belsey and Catherine Belsey, \\"Icons of Divinity: Portraits of Elizabeth I\\" in Gent and Llewellyen, Renaissance Bodies, p. 11‚Äì35 The queen is flanked by two columns behind, probably a reference to the famous impresa of the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, Philip II's father, which represented the Pillars of Hercules.Roy Strong; Art and Power; Renaissance Festivals 1450‚Äì1650, p 51, 1984, The Boydell Press; Andrew Belsey and Catherine Belsey have pointed out the striking geometry of the painting, with the repeating patterns of circles and arches described by the crown, the globe, and the sleeves, ruff, and gown worn by the queen. They also contrast the imperial figure of the Virgin Queen wearing the large pearl symbolizing chastity suspended from her bodice and the mermaid carved on the chair of state, representing female wiles luring sailors to their doom, another interpretation is that the mermaid symbolizes Mary Queen of Scots. Elizabeth is facing away from Mary indicating that the plots and Mary's execution are all behind her and she doesn't worry about it anymore. The crown also symbolises the English monarch. The chains of pearls in the portrait may represent the pearls which Elizabeth had bought from the collection of Mary, Queen of Scots in 1568.Lisa Hopkins, Writing Renaissance Queens: Texts by and about Elizabeth I and Mary, Queen of Scots (Delaware, 2002), p. 21. Versions There are three surviving versions of the portrait, in addition to several derivative portraits: * The version at Woburn Abbey * The version in the National Portrait Gallery, London, which has been cut down at both sides leaving just a portrait of the queen. * The version owned by the Tyrwhitt-Drake family, which may have been commissioned by Sir Francis Drake, was first recorded at Shardeloes in Buckinghamshire in 1775. Scholars agree that this version is by a different hand, noting distinctive techniques and approaches to the modelling of the queen's features. This version was heavily overpainted in the later 17th century, which complicates attribution and may account for several differences in details of the costume.Arnold, Queen Elizabeth's Wardrobe Unlock'd, p. 34‚Äì36 The Drake version was purchased for the nation for ¬£10.3 million in July 2016 following an Art Fund appeal. The work is hung in the national collection of Royal Museums Greenwich (RMG), in the Queen's House, a 17th-century royal residence built on the site of the original Greenwich Palace, Elizabeth I's birthplace. The first two portraits were formerly attributed to Elizabeth's Serjeant Painter George Gower, but curators at the National Portrait Gallery now believe that all three versions were created in separate workshops, and assign the attributions to \\"an unknown English artist\\".

During the late 1970s he also played association football for University College Dublin and Dublin University. After retiring from sport, MacNeill went on to serve as a director for Goldman Sachs. He has also worked as a rugby pundit for TV3 and BBC Radio 5 Live. Education Blackrock College MacNeill completed his secondary level education at Blackrock College. On 20 March 1977 he was a member of the Blackrock College team that won the Leinster Schools Rugby Senior Cup, defeating St Mary's College 24‚Äì12 after extra time at Lansdowne Road. The St Mary's team featured MacNeill's future Ireland teammate Paul Dean. MacNeill scored a conversion and two penalties in extra time to help seal victory for Blackrock. Trinity College Dublin MacNeill subsequently attended Trinity College Dublin where he earned a degree in economics and a diploma in Anglo-Irish literature. He was elected a Scholar of the College in 1979. His lecturers included Brendan Kennelly and David Norris. While at Trinity he played for both the rugby union and association football teams. On 26 November 1980 he captained Dublin University to a 9‚Äì3 win over University College Dublin in The Colours Match. He also went on a rugby union tour to Japan and represented the team in games against both Oxford University and Cambridge University. He played association football for both University College Dublin and Dublin University A.F.C.. In 1979 he was a member of the Dublin University team, coached by Liam Tuohy, that won the Collingwood Cup. MacNeill scored twice in the final as Dublin University defeated Maynooth University 2‚Äì0. Oxford University MacNeill also studied economics at St Edmund Hall, Oxford. Between 1982 and 1984 he played in three Varsity matches for Oxford University against Cambridge University but lost all three. He captained the Oxford team in 1983.

He was educated at the Free School, Canterbury, at Winchester College, and at New College, Oxford, where he became a Fellow, 18 January 1553. On Elizabeth I's accession he left England rather than conform to the new religion, going first to Leuven, and afterwards to Paris, to study theology.Burton, Edwin. \\"Thomas Stapleton.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 14. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 9 August 2019 In 1563, being in England, he was summoned by the Anglican bishop William Barlow to repudiate the pope's authority, but refused and was deprived of the prebend of Woodhorne in Chichester Cathedral, conferred on him in 1558. He then retired to Leuven with his father and other relatives. In 1568 he joined Cardinal Allen at Douai and took a great part in founding the English College there, both by lecturing and by devoting to its support his salary as lecturer in theology at Anchin College. He was appointed public professor of divinity, and canon of St. Amatus; and together with Allen he completed the degree of D.D. on 10 July 1571. In 1584 he resigned these preferments to enter the Society of Jesus, but did not complete his novitiate, and returned to Douai. Philip II of Spain appointed him professor of Scripture at the Catholic University of Leuven in 1590, to which office a canonry in St. Peter's Church was annexed; and soon after he was made dean of Hilverenbeeck in the Roman Catholic Diocese of 's-Hertogenbosch. The emoluments of these offices were all spent in relieving needy English Catholics. Meanwhile, his fame as a theologian had spread to Rome and Pope Clement VIII thought so much of his theological writings that he caused them to be read aloud at his table. Twice he invited Stapleton to Rome in vain, but his offer to make him prothonotary Apostolic in January 1597, was accepted. It was generally believed that he would be created cardinal, a suggestion which was disapproved of by Alfonso Agazzari, S.J., rector of the English College, and obstacles were put in the way of his journey to Rome (Eley, \\"Certaine Briefe Notes\\", p. 254). He accordingly remained in Leuven till his death in the following year. He left his books and manuscripts (now lost) to the English College at Douai. An original painting of Stapleton is preserved at Douai Abbey, Woolhampton, England. Works His first works were translations: Ven. Bede's \\"History of the Church in England\\" (Antwerp, 1565), the \\"Apology of Staphylus\\" (Antwerp, 1565), and Hosius on \\"The Expresse Word of God\\" (1567).

The West Croydon to Wimbledon Line was a railway line in south London. It was constructed by the Wimbledon and Croydon Railway (W&CR;) over part of the trackbed of the Surrey Iron Railway. It now forms part of the Tramlink network. History The line opened on 22 October 1855 connecting the South West Main Line of the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) to the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&SCR;). Initially, it was operated under contract by its engineer George Parker Bidder, but in 1856 it was leased to the LB&SCR;, which purchased it outright in 1858. After construction of the branch from Merton Park to Tooting in 1868 the section from Wimbledon to Merton Park became joint LSWR/LB&SCR.; On 1 January 1923, under the 1921 grouping, it became part of the Southern Railway. The line was electrified using the 750 V third rail direct current power supply on 6 July 1930. Upon the privatisation of British Rail, the last two years of the line's operation was spent under the control of Connex South Central. The last public train ran on 31 May 1997 and the line closed on 2 June 1997 for most of it to be converted into the Croydon Tramlink network, eventually opening in May 2000. A railtour consisting of two sets of 4VEPs was the last train to run on the line after the regular services, as well as the Addiscombe Line later that evening.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KI6bmrj7eFs References Closed railway lines in London Railway lines opened in 1855 Railway lines closed in 1997 History of rail transport in London Standard gauge railways in London ","title":"West Croydon to Wimbledon Line"},{"id":"14383642","text":"Living with Tigers is a 2003 documentary about tigers in Africa. It aired on Discovery. The sequel to Living with Tigers is Tiger Man of Africa on the Discovery Channel.  Synopsis  This documentary features a Bengal tiger re- wilding project started by John Varty in 2000. This project involves training captive-bred Bengal tiger cubs by their human trainers so that the tigers can regain their predatory instincts. Once they prove that they can sustain themselves in the wild, they would be released into the wilderness of Africa to fend for themselves. Their trainers, John Varty and Dave Salmoni (big-cat trainer and zoologist), have to teach them how to stalk, to hunt, and, most importantly, to associate hunting with food.  Reception  It is claimed by some that two Bengal tigers have already succeeded in re-wilding, and two more tigers are currently undergoing their re-wilding training. This project is featured by The Discovery Channel as a documentary, Living With Tigers. It was voted one of the best Discovery Channel documentaries in 2003. A strong criticism about this project is with the chosen cubs. Experts state that the four tigers (Ron, Julie, Seatao and Shadow) involved in the re-wilding project are not purebred Bengal tigers and should not be used for breeding. The four tigers are not recorded in the Bengal tiger studbook and should not be deemed as purebred Bengal tigers. Many tigers in the world's zoos are genetically impure, and there is no reason to suppose these four are not among them.Releasing Captive Tigers - South Africa The 1997 International Tiger Studbook lists the current global captive population of Bengal tigers at 210 tigers. All of the studbook-registered captive population is maintained in Indian zoos, except for one female Bengal tiger in North America.Save The Tiger Fund  Bengal Tiger It is important to note that Ron and Julie (two of the tigers) were bred in the United States and hand-raised at Bowmanville Zoo in Canada,Ron and Julie, Living with Tigers, Tiger Canyons, John Varty while Seatow and Shadow are two tigers bred in South Africa.Seatao and Shadow, Tiger Canyons, John Varty The tigers in the Tiger Canyons Project have recently been confirmed to be crossbred Siberian/Bengal tigers. Tigers that are not genetically pure are not allowed to participate in the tiger Species Survival Plan, which aims to breed genetically pure tiger specimens and individuals. The documentary has been alleged by some to be a fraud. One source claims that the tigers are unable to hunt, and the film crew chased the prey up against the fence and into the path of the tigers just for the sake of dramatic footage. Cory Meacham, a US-based environmental journalist mentioned that \\"the film has about as much to do with tiger conservation as a Disney cartoon.\\" An additional assertion is that the tigers have not been released and still reside in a small enclosure under constant watch and with frequent human contact. Some conservationists fear the public's being misled by false representation of footage.

Station history The station signed on in 1997 as a Top 40 station with the call letters WZJT and the on-air name ‚ÄúParty Radio Z-92.5.‚Äù The station was originally owned by the owner and operator of a nightclub in Birmingham. At the time, there was not another Top 40 music station in the Birmingham market, but the location of the station‚Äôs transmitter and its weak signal proved to be a hindrance as it sought to establish itself in the area. Within a few months of its debut, the station changed formats and became an active rock station with the new on-air name of ‚ÄúPlanet Rock 92-5‚Äù. The new format was no more successful in attracting listeners than its previous incarnation. In 2000, the station was sold and became an affiliate of EWTN‚Äôs Catholic radio network.

It stars Dick Van Dyke as Billy Bright (which was the original title of the film), Michele Lee as Bright's love interest, and Reiner himself and Mickey Rooney as Bright's friends and work colleagues. Reiner wrote the screenplay with Aaron Ruben; it was inspired by the end of silent film era and, in part, by the life of silent film superstar Buster Keaton.  Plot  Billy Bright (Dick Van Dyke), a silent-era film comedian, narrates this film which begins at his character's funeral in 1969 and tells his life story in flashbacks, unable to see his own faults and morosely (and incorrectly) blaming others for anything that has gone wrong. Headstrong and talented, vaudeville clown Bright arrives on his first California film location insisting that he will perform his bit role only if he can wear the outrageous costume and makeup of the character he has been known for on the stage. The director (Cornel Wilde) refuses and Bright begins to storm off, but when his car rolls off a cliff he is forced to accept the terms. As soon as the cameras are rolling, however, he improvises (and sabotages) his way to becoming the hero of the scenario. His combination of acquiescence and audacity pays off, and before long he has become a major film comedy star in the 1910s and '20s, the silent picture era of Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, Charlie Chaplin and Stan Laurel. Bright steals his leading lady, Mary (Michele Lee), and is beaten up by the director, whom she's been dating. The two increasingly popular performers marry, starting their own production company together. As early as her pregnancy, she begins to suspect his adultery; when she confronts him, he tries to turn the tables and shame her into apologizing for the accusation. But at the height of their fame and fortune, he is served with papers naming him in a Hollywood power couple's divorce filing. Mary leaves him, taking their young son and the couple's palatial estate. Bright sinks into despair and alcoholism, also leaving the country to film in Europe for four years. He sobers up and attempts a comeback in Hollywood but ‚Äî ever living in the past ‚Äî will accept it on no other terms than those he had been accustomed to, adamantly refusing the studio's offer to star him in a talkie, and storming out on his agent (Carl Reiner). Like the film industry, people are moving along without Billy, including his wife, who rebuffs his attempt to win her back. The one constant in his life, other than his decreasingly appealing sense of identity, is his old screen sidekick and only friend, Cockeye (Mickey Rooney). A late-1960s talk show host (Steve Allen as himself) has the faded star on in an effort to revive Bright's career, and the elderly comedian proves capable ‚Äî if somewhat pathetically to the groovy stars of the day on the couch alongside him ‚Äî of recreating his old pratfall schtick. The pitch works, but this time the only vehicle that will allow him to run through his preferred brand of slapstick is a detergent commercial. The denouement of Bright's life, and the film, finds him in and out of the hospital and visited by his now-grown son Billy Jr. (also played by Van Dyke in a dual role), reduced to setting the alarm in his dingy two-room apartment, and catching airings of him and his former wife's old comedies at odd hours on TV ‚Äî which he watches without a hint of a smile.

My Anecdotal Life (St. Martin's Press; 2003, hardcover, ). Quoted on The Comic trivia page at the Internet Movie Database. Reiner loosely patterned the story of Bright's career downfall on the real-life travails of a number of early film actors, primarily Buster Keaton, who likewise saw his Hollywood success falter as filmgoers' tastes changed and he fell into alcoholism. Some details parallel the experiences of silent comedian Harold Lloyd, as well as the film's co-star Mickey Rooney.  Response  Not many people saw the film upon its release, but it was appreciated later as a movie about one silent star's rise and fall, patterned after the many silent stars who tried to make it and failed in later years. Among the exceptions were silent and sound film star Stan Laurel, whom Dick Van Dyke loved. He later learned that many imitators came and went since the end of Laurel's time with Oliver Hardy, and no attempt was made to legally stop them from imitating Laurel and his friend Hardy or even copying his face, which in part inspired this film. Van Dyke said of The Comic: \\"very few people saw that movie, but we were proud of it.\\"On Larry King Live, \\"Dick Van Dyke Discusses His Career in Entertainment\\".

The story concerns John \\"Proof\\" Prufrock, a sasquatch, who works for a secret government organization. He hunts cryptids with his partner, Ginger Brown, and seeks clues to his past. The book was influenced by The X-Files and Tarzan.The Province The first issue was released on October 24, 2007.Cryptomundo.com ¬ª Proof: New CZ Comic Book Besides individual issues and trade paperbacks, Proof is also available on the iPhone and iPod Touch.http://www.macsimumnews.com/index.php/archive/iverse_media_releases_digital_comics_for_iphone_ipod_touch/ Publication history The character of Proof first appeared in \\"Berserker\\", a short story published in Negative Burn #7 (December 2006). The black-and- white story, also created by Alex Grecian and Riley Rossmo, shows Proof's battle with a skin-walker. Besides his own title, Proof appeared in 2008's Image Monster Pile-Up, a one-shot anthology comic that also featured The Astounding Wolf-Man, The Perhapanauts, and Firebreather. Plot The first arc, \\"Goatsucker\\", concerns a cryptid attack in Minnesota that appears to be the work of a Bigfoot-like creature. The plot also details the transfer of Ginger Brown, a young female agent, from the F.B.I to a secret organization called The Lodge. Once employed, Brown discovers that her partner is John \\"Proof\\" Prufrock, a Bigfoot who works in secret for the U.S. government. Brown's first case with The Lodge concerns El Chupacabra, a monster who masquerades as a human by wearing the skin of its victims. Ginger and Proof also encounter a number of cryptozoological fauna, including jackalopes, a golem, and the Cottingley Fairies.Proof on paper that Bigfoot exists , Edmonton Journal, October 27, 2008 The second arc, \\"The Company of Men\\", follows Proof as he attempts to save a juvenile dinosaur from poachers in the Congo. The third arc is called \\"Thunderbirds Are Go!\\" and features dual main plots: Ginger and Elvis journey to New York City to find Joe the golem, while Proof investigates sightings of condorlike thunderbirds in rural Illinois. \\"Thunderbirds Are Go!\\" guest-stars The Savage Dragon, another Image Comics character. The fourth arc, \\"Julia,\\" is set in the mid-19th century. The story delves into Proof's past with his so-called \\"brother\\" Mi-Chen Po, and the plot is loosely based on the history of Julia Pastrana. The fifth and final collection of the series entitled \\"Blue Fairies\\" gives readers a look at the maturation of male fairies, provides a brief look at the future of The Lodge, and concludes with the story \\"Who Killed the Dover Demon?\\" The final arc of the series sets the stage for the return of the character in a series of mini- series, the first of which is called Proof: Endangered. Characters *Proof: John Prufrock is a Bigfoot who works for The Lodge, a secret organization located in Washington. As a Bigfoot, he is vastly larger and more powerful than a human being.

Kelly is a partner in the Boston office of Jackson Lewis P.C. and is chair of the White Collar & Government Enforcement practice group and co-chair of the Collegiate & Professional Sports Industry practice group.  Career  Kelly founded the Boston-based law firm Kelly, Libby and Hoopes. Kelly was the assistant United States attorney during the trial and investigation of then-NHLPA head Alan Eagleson over corruption and embezzlement. Eagleson eventually pleaded guilty to fraud in Boston and was imprisoned in Toronto. In 2000, Kelly represented Marty McSorley during the latter's trial in Vancouver for on-ice assault with a hockey stick.  NHLPA director  Kelly was appointed as executive director of the NHLPA, replacing Ted Saskin who had been ousted for secretly monitoring player e-mail accounts. Kelly was strongly in favour of adding an NHL team in Canada. On August 31, 2009, Kelly was unexpectedly fired as head of the National Hockey league Players' Association following several hours of meetings in Chicago. Russ Conway, the former Lawrence Eagle Tribune NHL and Boston Bruins sportswriter who had helped to expose Alan Eagleson's corrupt practices, described Kelly as the first \\"true, clean\\" leader the NHLPA ever had, and said \\"this is a very sad day for hockey. Unfortunately, the union continues to drink the Kool-Aid.\\" Some have speculated that Kelly was forced out in a power struggle.http://www.cbc.ca/sports/blogs/2009/08/kelly_the_latest_victim_in_nhl.html Ron Pink, the advisory board head, who had also applied for Kelly's position in 2007, and an ombudsman, Buzz Hargrove were also instrumental in the decision to dismiss Kelly. Hargrove, Pink, Ian Penny, Ian Pulver and Eric Lindros were said to represent the \\"old guard of the NHLPA\\", one that was confrontational and focused on driving up player salaries, rather than the overall financial well-being of the league, and believed that the union conceded too much in negotiations during the 2004-05 lockout. Kelly was not involved with the NHLPA when the deal was negotiated; nonetheless he stated publicly that he did not want to see another work stoppage when the agreement expired on September 15, 2011. Penny was named the interim director later that day. Donald Fehr became the permanent executive director on August 26, 2010. College Hockey, Inc. In November 2009, Kelly was hired as executive director of College Hockey, Inc., an organization set up by the commissioners of the six men's Division I college ice hockey conferences to promote college ice hockey as an option for potential recruits. The organization also advises colleges looking into the possibility of adding NCAA Division I ice hockey. Jackson Lewis P.C. Kelly has been a practicing trial lawyer for over 30 years, with extensive experience in white collar criminal defense, internal investigations, complex civil litigation and crisis management.

The Polizia Stradale patrols the 7,000 kilometers of motorways (autostrada) in Italy and the main highways and arterial roads outside towns. Missions include the prevention and detection of driving offences, traffic accident reporting, planning and carrying out services to regulate traffic, providing escorts for road safety, protecting and controlling the road network, rescue operations and cooperation in the collection of traffic flow data. Between the several activities it carries out also services of supply and regulation of the traffic. Under the profile of the communication verification the news on the practicability that then comes diffuse from the Center coordination information on street emergency (Centro Addestramento Polizia di Stato) (C.C.I.S.S.). It also promotes the initiatives and campaigns of sensibilities of the citizens, in particular young people, on street emergencies. History During the reconstruction after World War II the number of automobiles on the roads began to increase. In order to respond to the increasing requirements of this traffic, highway patrol sections were formed at 72 police headquarters with the employment of 2600 men and numerous motorcycles of various origins, mostly military surplus, in the first months of 1946. The PS was established by a decree issued 26 November 1947 signed by the former Temporary Head of the State, Enrico de Nicola. He established the tasks of the service and its organization, attributing some the management not to the Ministry of the Public Works but to the Interior. Subsequently the Polizia Stradale was organized into departments with regional responsibility and sections with local competence with subordinate sub-sections and detachments. The necessity of centralized control has increased with the passing of the years. http://quanteruote.libero.it/media/blogs/qr/renaultlagunapolizia.JPG  Organization The PS is managed by the Central Directorate for Police, Railway, and Communications and the Special Police Departments of State Police, a part of Department of Public Security at the Ministry of Interior.

Early life  Moore's formal musical training began at twelve, first on trombone, then clarinet before switching to tenor saxophone. Inspired by the style of Lester Young (aka Prez or Pres), he got his first professional experience playing in a Texas territorial band the summer before entering college.  Professional career  Moore left the University of Mississippi in his first year to pursue a performing career, with stints in New Orleans, Memphis and New York City (twice) between 1942-47. In New York he first heard the new music called bebop. As one who idolized Young (he even held his horn at the same unorthodox 120 degree angle), Moore was at first uncomfortable with it, but as he recalled for The New York Times critic John Wilson in 1968: \\"When I heard what Bird (Charlie Parker) had done for himself, I realized that Pres was not the complete messiah. So I combined Bird and Pres and my own thing.\\"John S. Wilson, \\"Brew Moore, Saxophonist, Back After Two Decades.\\" NY Times, September 11, 1968. Returning to New York in 1948, Moore became a fixture on the city's vibrant jazz scene, cutting his first album as a leader (\\"Brew Moore and His Playboys,\\"Savoy Records) and working with Machito's orchestra and Claude Thornhill's Big Band, the Kai Winding sextet, Stan Getz and George Wallington among others. In 1949 he joined three of the \\"four brothers\\" from Woody Herman's celebrated Second Herd (Getz, Zoot Sims, Al Cohn) plus Allen Eager in a session that resulted in the album The Brothers for the Prestige Label.http://www.jazzdisco.org/prestige- records/discography-1949-1950/#490408 And in the early 50s he gigged with Bird and other beboppers of note at venues like Birdland. Pianist Gene DiNovi described him as \\"a natural player. I remember him saying once that you should come to the saxophone as a child would‚Äîpick it up and blow. He had blond, straw-colored hair. Always with a farmer's cow-lick sticking up. He was a very simple, lovely person.\\"Mark Gardner, Liner notes to I Should Care, SteepleChase, 1993 He left New York in 1954 for the West Coast, settling eventually in San Francisco where he found a congenial environment, fitting well into the beat generation culture personified by one of his acknowledged admirers, Jack Kerouac.Larry Kart, Jazz and Jack Kerouac (see references) In 1959 the heavy drinking that had early on given him his nickname took its toll, and he withdrew from the scene. He subsequently resurfaced in Europe. Based out of Copenhagen, Denmark, he would, with the exception of three years in New York (1967‚Äì70), continue to perform there for the rest of his life, teaming with such notable fellow ex-pats as Kenny Drew and Sahib Shihab as well as European stalwarts Niels-Henning √òrsted Pedersen and Alex Riel. In August 1973, back in Copenhagen from a trip home to settle his late father's affairs (and, ironically, after years of economic uncertainty coming into a substantial inheritance), he fell down a flight of stairs in Tivoli Gardens after a characteristically bibulous night and suffered the injuries that caused his death.  Influence and legacy  Storyville Records executive Alun Morgan suggests in liner notes for the CD reissue \\"No More Brew\\" that Moore's \\"total discography is small for a man of his musical stature\\" because of the saxophonist's unswerving adherence to his Lestorian roots. And indeed, as critic Scott Yanow has pointed out, \\"In the early '50s, [Moore] recorded . . . with fellow tenors Stan Getz, Al Cohn, Zoot Sims, and Alan Eager; at the time, they all sounded identical. Moore was the only one of the five who did not change his sound through the years.\\"Scott Yanow, Brew Moore, Allmusic Alternatively, Danish scholar Soren Schou has likened Moore's \\"epic melodist\\" playing to writing a novel and contrasted it with the concentrated \\"short story\\" approach practiced by post-Bird improvisers.S√∏ren Schou, \\"Brew Moore ‚Äì En Melodisk Epiker,\\" Tidsskrift: Jazz Special, No. 62, 2002. Certainly Moore's expansive style of playing tested the attention span of post-bop era listeners. (In evidence of this, one is referred to his X-rated comments to an apparently less than fully engaged Stockholm audience while introducing \\"Manny's Tune\\" on \\"No More Brew,\\" Storyville CD 8275, 1998.) Moore himself told critic Ralph Gleason in 1954, \\"The idea of playing for me is to compose a different, not always better I'm afraid, melody on the tune and basis of the original song, rather than construct a series of chord progressions around the original chords.\\" An idea the more pre-bop inclined Gleason clearly approved of, noting that Moore \\"has two absolutely golden gifts.

On 2 January 1998, a magistrate cleared her extradition to Germany. After a long and prominent campaign in which her mother took a leading role supported by many influential citizens, including politicians, from the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United States, British Home Secretary Jack Straw vetoed the extradition on health grounds. She eventually gave birth to a healthy daughter, Loinnir, in England. Due to the nature of the European Arrest Warrant, McAliskey spent 18 months in jail despite never being charged with any crime. Her UK lawyers were unable to view any of the evidence that led to the warrant in Germany and only following discoveries made by a German television program and the appointment of a German lawyer to examine the files in Germany did it become clear that she had no case to answer. In July 2000, the then Solicitor General in the UK, Ross Cranston, confirmed to Parliament that the CPS had undertaken an investigation into R√≥is√≠n McAliskey's case stating \\"Further to the statement of the Home Secretary on 10 March 1998 that he would not order the extradition of Roisin McAliskey to Germany, the Crown Prosecution Service... has considered whether to prosecute Roisin McAliskey in this country.

The college she founded was named in her honour the Maria Grey Training College. Biography Family  Maria Georgina Shirreff was born on 7 March 1816 in Blackheath, London. She was the third daughter of Admiral William Henry and Elizabeth Anne Shirreff. Out of her three sisters, Caroline (b. 1812), Emily (b. 1814), and Katherine (b. 1818), Maria was very close to her elder sister Emily Shirreff, who would later become her collaborator in her writings and campaigns. She also had two brothers who both died at an early age. Educational experiences In the 1820s the family lived in France where their father was stationed at St Germain en Laye, near Paris, and later in Normandy. The four Shirreff sisters were first taught at home by a French-Swiss governess who had a limited education. In 1828, Maria and Emily joined a boarding school in Paris, which later influenced scenes in Maria's second novel Love‚Äôs Sacrifice in 1868. A year later they were removed from the school due to Emily's poor health and after their father was appointed captain of the port of Gibraltar in 1831 he did not think it was necessary to appoint another governess. Though their formal education was at an end, Maria and Emliy continued to improve themselves by travelling extensively and became expert linguists through their visits to France, Spain and Italy, reading books from their father's extensive library, and became acquainted with many intellectuals of the age through their father's contacts. In 1834 Mrs Shirreff brought her daughters back to England, and Maria and Emily began to write together. They first produced Letters from Spain and Barbary, published in 1835. In 1841 the wrote a novel called Passion and Principle, published anonymously In 1841 Maria married her cousin, William Thomas Grey, a wine merchant who was the nephew of former prime minister Earl Grey. The marriage was a happy one but produced no children. Early writings Even though she was married, Maria still remained close to Emily. She moved into William and Maria's home, and the sisters continued to write together. Their treatise on women's education, Thoughts on Self Culture Address to Women, was published in 1850 funded by Maria's husband. In the publication they voiced their disapproval of the frivolous attitude to marriage and the established view that women should be only educated enough to attract a husband. They also laid out a basis for education for girls which included subjects, such as arithmetic, geometry, history, elementary science and politics, usually neglected in customary female education of the time. They also argued that female education should not end at ‚Äòthe period when female education is supposed to be finished‚Äô and continue into later life. Activities Maria's husband died in 1864, and she began to take an active role in public life and joined Emily in the movement for the improving of education for girls. She was especially interested in the lack of funding for girls‚Äô education. In 1870 she wrote to the repeatedly to The Times to try to raise funds for the North London Collegiate School for Girls and encouraged Frances Buss to introduce student teachers. In the same year she also unsuccessfully stood for election as the representative for the Borough of Chelsea to The London School Board, one of the first women to do so. Her speeches were later published in a booklet entitled The London School Board. Maria saw the election as a turning point in her career leading her and Emily to work more toward the improvement of Women's Education. Maria and Emily were also suffragists and in 1870 Maria published a booklet Is the Exercise of the Suffrage unfeminine?. Maria demanded the girls should receive an education which would prepare them for their increased civil responsibilities. Women's Education Union Maria proposed the creation of a national movement which would promote women's education and presented the scheme to the Society of Arts in 1871. The scheme received great support and Maria gave a second paper to the Social Science Association's annual congress in Leeds later the same year. As a result, Maria and Emily set up a provisional committee named the National Union of the Improving the Education of Women of All Classes (later shortened to the Women's Education Union). The Union aimed 1871 to establish good and cheap day schools for all classes above the level of elementary education. Maria and Emily were very active in the Union, and Emily acted as the organizing secretary of the Union until 1879. Maria Grey Training College (1946) The Union also led to the formation The Girls' Public Day School Company (GPDSC) (now the Girls' Day School Trust) in 1872 to provide new secondary schools to educate girls from various classes. Maria was an active member of the Council of the GPDSC until 1890 when her poor health prevented her. In September 2007, this trust converted one of its schools (The Belvedere School) back into the maintained sector.; Maria also encouraged the GPDSC to set up teaching training Departments to train the next generation of teachers. Maria retired from the Council of the GPDSC in 1890 and was made a Vice-President of the organisation. In 1878 Maria also help found a teacher training college with The Teachers‚Äô Training and Registration Society. In 1885 the College was renamed The Maria Grey Training College for Women. In 1976 the College merged with Borough Road College to form the West London Institute of Higher Education, which is now part of Brunel University. Later life Maria continued to give speeches and write through the 1880s. By 1890 she became too ill to be active and for last 15 years of her life, Maria lived in strict retirement due to ill health. Despite her ill health and Emily's death in 1897 she wrote her Last Words to Girls on Life in School and after School in 1889. She died on 19 September 1906, at 41 Stanhope Gardens, Kensington, London, the house in which she had lived with Emily.

The line is served by Great Western Railway local services between Reading and Basingstoke, which stop at the intermediate stations Reading West, Mortimer and Bramley. The line is also an important through route for longer distance passenger and freight services: CrossCountry services from Bournemouth and Southampton to Birmingham and the North of England and freight trains between Southampton Docks and the Midlands use the line. The section of line between Southcote Junction and Basingstoke was resignalled in 2006, to increase the capacity of the line.  History  A railway was originally proposed in 1843 as a link between Basingstoke, Newbury and Didcot by the London and South Western Railway. A new company, the Berks and Hants Railway had the idea of building the link between Basingstoke and Reading. The Berks and Hants Railway joined the Great Western Railway before the track was laid. The railway was built by the GWR, with the engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who used broad gauge, from Reading's railway station to Basingstoke. Since the main line at Basingstoke used standard gauge, it was impossible for the railways to share the same station. The GWR built a small station to the north of the L&SWR;'s station. In 1846, prior to the line being built, the Gauge Commissioners (Regulation of Gauge Act) recommended to Parliament that the line from Reading to Basingstoke should be built to standard gauge. In 1854 the Great Western was ordered to convert the railway to standard gauge between Reading and Basingstoke by 7 February 1856, or face a fine of ¬£200 each day. However, it was not until 22 December 1856 that a mixed gauge track was opened. Basingstoke kept its separate Great Western station until 1 January 1932 when trains were diverted into the L&SWR; station with addition of one platform, still in use today, from the old station. In 1895, a railway station was opened at Bramley, then in 1917, a large depot was opened at Bramley Ordnance Depot, which had a complex network of sidings. The depot was used to manufacture and store ammunition, and lasted until 1987. Another station was opened at , and allowed long-distance trains to call at Reading without the need to reverse at Reading's main station. This became less of an issue when diesel multiple unit trains were introduced, which could easily reverse at Reading General.

There are two tracks and speed is limited to 75 mph. There is a level crossing at Bramley railway station. The line was due to be electrified by 2017, but this has been delayed until Control Period 6 (2019-2024).  Services  A at Bramley The route sees two stopping services in either direction every hour which are operated by Great Western Railway using Class 165 or Class 166 trains. There were two Class 150 units (illustrated) on the route but these have been redeployed to the Bristol area. A further train in each direction every hour, half-hourly at times, is operated by CrossCountry but this does not call at stations between Reading and Basingstoke. South West Trains previously ran services to Brighton on this route. As of 19 May 2019, South Western Railway run Sunday services, scheduled hourly between 0800 and 1800.  Future  The railway is listed with Network Rail as part of route 13, the Great Western main line, and was due to be electrified with 25 kV overhead wiring by 2017 as part of the modernisation of the main line. In July 2007, plans were agreed to build a station in Reading south of Southcote Junction in the Green Park business park, serving the southern suburbs of Reading and also the Madejski Stadium. Construction of Reading Green Park railway station was expected to be completed in 2010; the plans were suspended in 2011, but were reinstated in 2013. It is now set to open by the end of 2020, with electrification along the line at a later date.

He was known as Virginia's \\"Mr. Republican.\\" Education and career Born on July 3, 1901, in Carroll County, Virginia, Dalton received an Artium Baccalaureus degree in 1924 from the College of William & Mary and a Bachelor of Laws in 1926 from William & Mary Law School. He entered private practice in Radford, Virginia from 1926 to 1959. His law partners included Richard Harding Poff, and in later years both Poff and Dalton were mentioned as potential nominees to the Supreme Court of the United States. Dalton also worked with James Clinton Turk, who like Dalton later became a federal judge. He was Commonwealth's Attorney in Radford from 1928 to 1936. He was a member of the Senate of Virginia from 1944 to 1959. Political career Dalton won his first Virginia Senate election as a write-in candidate in 1944, and became the leading Republican in Virginia during his 15 years a member of the Senate of Virginia. Senator Dalton ran unsuccessfully as the Republican candidate for Governor of Virginia in 1953 and 1957, in opposition to the fading but still dominant Democratic Byrd Organization led by United States Senator Harry F. Byrd. Both times Dalton proposed to abolish the poll tax. Dalton's first campaign was the high point of what appeared to be a new era for the Republican Party in Virginia. In the federal elections of 1952, three Virginia Republicans including Dalton's old law partner Poff were elected to Congress, and Dwight D. Eisenhower carried Virginia in the presidential election. In 1953, against Democrat Thomas Bahnson Stanley and Independent Howard Carwile, Dalton garnered 45% of the vote. His running mates in that election were both lawyers: Stephen Timberlake of Staunton as the candidate for lieutenant governor and Walter Edward Hoffman of Norfolk (another future federal judge) for Attorney General. Public finance for transportation proved a crucial issue, as Senator Byrd took back his promise to his friend Dalton not to intervene, after Dalton proposed road bonds at odds with Byrd's doctrine of \\"pay as you go.\\" School desegregation seemed the major issue in the 1957 election (in the wake of the 1954 and 1955 decisions in Brown v. Board of Education), and Dalton lost badly to Democrat J. Lindsay Almond Jr. By 1956, Byrd Democrats including Almond had responded with \\"Massive Resistance\\", vowing to close schools to avoid integration. Passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1957 and efforts by the federal government to enforce desegregation in Little Rock Central High School were used against Republicans, and led to the widened margin of defeat for Dalton in his second statewide campaign. Dalton had criticized the Brown decisions, and proposed a pupil placement plan that would allow most schools to remain segregated \\"for maybe a hundred years.\\" He also wrote to President Eisenhower, urging withdrawal of the troops from Little Rock, Arkansas. Nonetheless, Dalton managed just 36.5% of the vote. When Senator Byrd announced retirement plans in 1958, Senator Dalton cast the only vote in the General Assembly against a resolution urging Byrd to run again, which Byrd did. Governor Mills E. Godwin Jr. selected Dalton to serve on the Virginia Commission for Constitutional Revision, the efforts of which led to the Virginia Constitution of 1971. Lewis F. Powell Jr., Oliver Hill, former governors Albertis Harrison and Colgate Darden also served on that commission. Federal judicial service Dalton was nominated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on July 21, 1959, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia vacated by Judge John Paul Jr. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on August 12, 1959, and received his commission on August 13, 1959. He served as Chief Judge from 1960 to 1971. He assumed senior status on October 12, 1976. President Gerald Ford nominated Glen Morgan Williams as Dalton's successor, after Senator William L. Scott derailed the nomination of the President's first choice. Dalton's service terminated on October 30, 1989, due to his death in Radford. Notable cases Along with his colleagues, Dalton as federal judge presided over litigation that continued into the 1970s to implement the Brown decision in Virginia's public schools. Dalton ordered the desegregation plan for the public schools in Roanoke, Virginia, which ultimately led to the conversion of the Lucy Addison High School (for African Americans) into a desegregated middle school.Green v. School Bd. of City of Roanoke, 330 F. Supp. 674 (W.D. Va. 1971). Dalton served on the three-judge panel in a case rejecting a constitutional challenge to Virginia's method of distributing state money for education to the various school districts across the state.Burruss v. Wilkerson, 310 F. Supp. 572 (W.D. Va. 1969). Family Dalton was born in Carroll County, Virginia to parents Currell Dalton (November 4, 1866 ‚Äì November 29, 1919) and Loduska Vernon Martin (December 10, 1869 ‚Äì 1920). His wife, Mary Turner, died September 1988. Dalton's grandmother Clarissa Goad Dalton (August 18, 1841 ‚Äì February 28, 1907) was related to Dexter Goad (November 5, 1867 ‚Äì July 1, 1939), the Republican clerk of court in Carroll County at the time of the courthouse shootings following the conviction of Floyd Allen in March 1912. Dalton's nephew, John Nichols Dalton, whom he had adopted as his son, was elected as a Republican as Governor of Virginia in 1977. Their next-door neighbor in Radford was Charlotte Giesen, who became the first Republican woman elected to the House of Delegates in 1957. Honors In 1968, Dalton was selected as an honorary member of the Order of the Coif of the law school of Washington and Lee University. Dalton also received an honorary doctorate of laws degree from the College of William & Mary in 1972. Death and legacy Dalton died at Radford Community Hospital of complications from pneumonia. He outlived his son, John Dalton, by some three years. Dalton's former law clerks included Glen E. Conrad, who in 2003 succeeded United States District Judge Glen Williams on the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia, but whose nomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit lapsed at the end of the term of President George W. Bush. Dalton's personal papers are held by the Special Collections Research Center at the College of William & Mary.

A member of the Bill Evans Trio in the mid-1960s, he also played timpani with the Los Angeles Philharmonic orchestra. Biography Born in Long Beach, California, Bunker was a central figure on the West Coast jazz scene, one of the relatively few who actually were from the region. In the 1950s and 1960s he appeared at Howard Rumsey's Lighthouse in Hermosa Beach, and performed with Shorty Rogers and His Giants and others. At first he played primarily drums, but increasingly he focused on vibraphone and was later highly regarded for his playing of timpani and various percussion instruments. A dependable and in-demand studio drummer and vibist, Bunker achieved particular distinction by recording with Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, Peggy Lee, Diana Krall, and many other jazz greats. In 1952, he was the drummer in one of Art Pepper's first groups. In 1953 and 1954, Bunker played drums in some of the earliest of Gerry Mulligan's groups. From 1963 to 1965, he was, intermittently, the drummer in the Bill Evans trio. His work in movie soundtracks spanned over fifty years, from Stalag 17 (1953) and Glengarry Glen Ross (1992) to The Incredibles (2004), and included soundtracks by John Williams, Henry Mancini, Quincy Jones, Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa, Jerry Goldsmith, Johnny Mandel, Lalo Schifrin and many other composers. Bunker died of complications of a stroke in Los Angeles at age 76.

The route The route is named after the Mortimer family of ruling Marcher Lords, often titled Earl of March, whose rise through successive generations from Norman times through the medieval period helped to shape the history and geography of this area of the Welsh Marches. The route runs between Ludlow Castle, the former headquarters of the Council of the Marches and a seat of Mortimer power, and Kington, Herefordshire, in the quiet west of the county near the Welsh border. The route crosses the River Teme and enters Mortimer Forest, an area of forested ridges. It passes Croft Castle and the Iron Age hill fort Croft Ambrey (not far from Wigmore and the initial seat of Mortimer power), and then passes through quiet Aymestrey. Near Aymestrey it passes through Puckhouse Wood, reputedly haunted by pucks or wood sprites. According to lore, a traveller lost in the wood at night paid a stipend for a bell to be tolled to rescue travellers from the Puck's clutches. The path crosses the River Lugg and the River Arrow and ends in Kington. Five loop walks depart from and return to the main waymarked trail at various points along the route, enabling investigation of surrounding attractions, villages and features.

R. Monterose (January 19, 1927 ‚Äì September 16, 1993), born Frank Anthony Peter Vincent Monterose, Jr., was an American jazz saxophonist playing mainly tenor occasional soprano.  Early life  J.R. or JR (derived from Jr.) Monterose grew up in Utica, New York, where his family moved a few months after his birth. He began formal clarinet studies at thirteen, but was largely self-taught as a tenor saxophonist, which he took up at fifteen after hearing Glenn Miller band soloist Tex Beneke. His earliest influences were Coleman Hawkins and Chu Berry, but, as he told critic Leonard Feather, he also found harmonic inspiration in pianists, citing Bud Powell and the instruction of Utica-based guitarist and pianist Sam Mancuso in helping him learn how to use chord changes.  Professional career  Monterose's first professional experience was playing in upstate New York territory dance bands (1947‚Äì49). In 1950 he joined Henry \\"Hot Lips\\" Busse's touring orchestra. After a brief return to Utica, he joined the Buddy Rich big band in late 1951. Though the band had some excellent bop-oriented musicians (Rich, Dave Schildkraut, Allen Eager and Philly Joe Jones) he soon left, citing the lack of soloing opportunities. \\"After six months I was drugged with my own playing,\\" he declared in a 1956 interview, \\"and I went back home and spent the next couple of years working in little joints but with good men.\\"Leonard Feather, 1956 liner notes to J. R. Monterose, in Blue Note Connoisseur Series CD reissue In New York City in the mid to late 1950s, Monterose was a featured soloist with Claude Thornhill's orchestra and with vibraphonist Teddy Charles' modernist groups, Charles Mingus's Jazz Workshop and Kenny Dorham's short-lived Jazz Prophets. Dorham, Monterose told critic Mark Gardner in 1975, \\"was one of the greatest leaders and players I ever played for...A wonderful musician.\\"Mark Gardner, Liner Notes (1975) to J. R. Monterose/The Message, Prevue Reissue, 1998 He also recorded two sessions as leader, J. R. Monterose (Blue Note, 1956) produced by Alfred Lion with liner notes by Leonard Feather and The Message (JARO, 1959) produced by Manny Albam with Nat Hentoff providing commentary. The record of Monterose's life thereafter, however, is one of sparsely documented itinerancy, pursuing his evolving craft in small-time U.S. venues and during extended stays (late 1960s through the mid-1970s) in Belgium, The Netherlands and Denmark, with occasional low-profile recordings (In Action, Body and Soul) recorded in such places as Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and Wageningen, The Netherlands. His preference for small-group work in out of the way places would shape much of his subsequent career, contributing to the musical growth but relegating him to obscurity. The last decade and a half of Monterose's life was spent at upstate New York venues, including the Lark Tavern in Albany. Live recordings at the Lark and other upstate New York venues such as Opus 40 have been released by Croscrane Records. His visit to play Copenhagen's Jazzhuz in 1988, recorded by Danish Broadcasting, has been released by Storyville under the title T.T.T. Other live recordings from his final years, when he was in less than robust health, are available on the Croscrane specialty label.  Influence and legacy  While Monterose considered himself an underground artist, his work, both as player and composer, remains esteemed by musicians, critics and aficionados of classic jazz. He never denied having been influenced by Stan Getz, Sonny Rollins and John Coltrane, but refused to be pigeonholed in any particular style. \\"I've tried all my life to avoid copying. If I can't be myself, there's no point being in jazz.\\"Nat Hentoff, Liner Notes to \\"The Message\\", Prevue CD PR4 (Reissue of a 1959 Jaro/Xanadu LP) It was this uncompromising insistence on going his own way, both musically and geographically, that moved jazz historian and writer David Brent Johnson to describe Monterose as \\"The Best Tenor You Never Heard.\\"David Brent Johnson, http://wfiu.org/nightlights/the- best-tenor-you-never-heard-jr-monterose/ Discography As leader *1956: J.

The screenplay by Taradash and Elick Moll focuses on what were at the time two very controversial subjects - Communism and book banning - and took a strong stance against censorship. The film stars Bette Davis, and was the first overtly anti-McCarthyism film to be produced in Hollywood. Synopsis Alicia Hull is a widowed small town librarian dedicated to introducing children to the joy of reading. In exchange for fulfilling her request for a children's wing, the city council asks her to withdraw the book The Communist Dream from the library's collection. When she refuses to comply with their demand, she is fired, and branded as a subversive. Especially upset by this is young Freddie Slater, a boy with a deep love of books whom Alicia has closely mentored. Judge Ellerbe feels Alicia has been treated unfairly, and calls a town meeting, hoping to rally support for her. However, ambitious attorney and aspiring politician Paul Duncan, who is dating assistant librarian Martha Lockeridge, undermines those efforts by publicly revealing Alicia's past associations with organizations that turned out to be Communist fronts. Alicia notes that she resigned as soon as she found out the true nature of the organizations, but Duncan's incendiary revelations result in only a handful of people showing up to the meeting. Those that do attend express concern about being branded Communists themselves if they stand with Alicia. Upon hearing their concerns, Alicia informs the meeting that she no longer wishes to fight the city council, and wants to let the matter drop. With no opposition to her removal mounted, virtually the entire town eventually turns against Alicia. Freddie, convinced by the opinions of others, particularly his narrow-minded father, that Alicia is a bad person, is unable to handle the resulting feelings of betrayal. He becomes increasingly fearful even of books themselves, and he begins to break down completely, culminating in his setting fire to the library. His actions cause the residents to have a change of heart, and they ask Alicia to return and supervise the construction of a new building. Alicia agrees, lamenting her earlier decision not to fight and vowing never again to allow a book to be removed from the library.

The following year, she withdrew from the project, a month before filming was scheduled to begin, ostensibly due to the fact it was not a Technicolor production. Within days, Kramer signed Barbara Stanwyck to replace her, but scheduling conflicts with his new star repeatedly delayed the start of filming. Kramer eventually dropped out of the project, and it remained in limbo until Taradash decided to direct it himself with the new title.Storm Center at Turner Classic Movies Although set in New England, the Columbia Pictures release was filmed on location in Santa Rosa, California. It is the only film ever directed by Taradash. The film is also notable for featuring an early poster and title sequence created by noted graphic designer Saul Bass. The opening title sequence features flames that eat away at both the face of a boy and pages from a book. The pages are from \\"On Liberty\\" by John Stuart Mill. The two pages are actually duplicates of a single page from chapter two of Mill's 1859 essay. The page contains this passage: > Strange it is that men should admit the validity of the arguments for free > speech but object to their being ‚Äúpushed to an extreme‚Äù, not seeing that > unless the reasons are good for an extreme case, they are not good for any > case. While the events in the movie were largely fictional, the character played by Bette Davis was based on Ruth W. Brown, the Bartlesville, Oklahoma, librarian, and her struggle with the county commission over communist literature.American Library Association (N.D.). Storm Center. Retrieved from http://www.ala.org/tools/storm-center Critical reception In his review in The New York Times, Bosley Crowther felt that \\"the purpose and courage of the men who made this film not only are to be commended, but also deserve concrete rewards. They have opened a subject that is touchy and urgent in contemporary life...[They] put a stern thought in this film, which is that the fears and suspicions of our age are most likely to corrupt and scar the young...However, the thesis is much better than the putting forth of it. The visualization of this drama is clumsy and abrupt...Mr. Blaustein and Mr. Taradash have tried nobly, but they have failed to develop a film that whips up dramatic excitement or flames with passion in support of its theme.\\" Of Bette Davis, he wrote \\"[She gives] a fearless and forceful performance as the middle-aged widowed librarian who stands by her principles. Miss Davis makes the prim, but stalwart, lady human and credible.\\"New York Times review Time wrote that the film \\"makes reading seem nearly as risky a habit as dope...[It] is paved and repaved with good intentions; its heart is insistently in the right place; its leading characters are motivated by the noblest of sentiments. All that Writer-Director Taradash forgot was to provide a believable story.\\"Time review In the Saturday Review, Arthur Knight wrote that the film \\"comes to grips with its central problem with a forthright honesty and integrity...It may be that in fashioning the story, the authors have made their film a bit too pat, a bit too glib, a bit too easy in its articulation of the various points of view expressed. Bette Davis's enlightened liberalism sounds at times as dangerously smug and self-righteous as the benighted politicos and anti-intellectuals who oppose her.\\"Storm Center at University of Pennsylvania website The National Legion of Decency stated the \\"propaganda film offers a warped, over-simplified emotional solution to the complex problems of civil liberties in American life\\". Daily Variety responded to the Legion by suggesting \\"It's almost impossible to over-dramatize human liberty whether it's a depiction of Patrick Henry...or a librarian sacrificing her reputation rather than her democratic principles.\\" Time Out London calls the film a \\"didactic, laborious piece\\".Time Out London review TV Guide wrote that \\"While the film was forthright in its attempt to deal with censorship, the execution was dismal. The sudden alteration in the town's beliefs is just too nonsensical to accept. Davis, however, is quite convincing as the principled librarian, but there just isn't enough of a story to complement her performance.\\"TV Guide review Of it, Davis herself said \\"I was not overjoyed with the finished film...I had far higher hopes for it. The basic lack was the casting of the boy. He was not a warm, loving type of child...His relationship with the librarian was totally unemotional, and, therefore, robbed the film of its most important factor, [since] their relationship...was the nucleus of the script.\\"Mother Goddam by Whitney Stine, with a running commentary by Bette Davis, Hawthorn Books, 1974, p. 264 () In 1957, Storm Center was awarded the Prix de Chevalier da la Barre at the Cannes Film Festival, where it was cited as \\"this year's film which best helps freedom of expression and tolerance\\".New York Times, Daniel Taradash Letter to the Editor, October 18, 1992 See also *List of American films of 1956 References External links * 1956 films 1956 drama films American black-and-white films American drama films American films Columbia Pictures films English-language films Films scored by George Duning Films about McCarthyism Films shot in California Films set in libraries 1956 directorial debut films Films featuring a title sequence by Saul Bass ","title":"Storm Center"},{"id":"14384714","text":"The Criminal Records Act (the Act) is a piece of Canadian legislation intended to provide for the relief of persons who have been convicted of offences and have subsequently rehabilitated themselves. It became law in 1985. The purpose of the Act is to provide a means of criminal records suspension. According to the Act, a record suspension is evidence of the fact that the applicant was of good conduct, and that the conviction should no longer reflect adversely on the applicant's character. Following a successful application, the records in question are kept separate and apart from other criminal records, are removed from the automated criminal records retrieval system maintained by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), and are not disclosed to any person without the prior approval of the Minister. Without a record suspension, Canadians can face problems securing employment, housing and volunteer positions.  The Parole Board of Canada  The Act gives the Parole Board of Canada the exclusive jurisdiction and absolute discretion to grant, refuse or revoke a record suspension.  Procedure  The Act sets out the procedure for granting a record suspension. Firstly, the applicant must satisfy a waiting period of 10 years in the case of indictable offences and five years in the case of summary offences. The Act also provides relief for military service records. Ineligible offences Two types of records are ineligible under the Act: * Schedule 1 offences against a minor * More than three indictable convictions each carrying a prison sentence of more than two years In the case of Schedule 1 offences, there is an exception if the person was less than five years older than the victim, was not in a position of trust or authority and no force or coercion was used. The onus is on the applicant to prove that this is the case. Even if all the eligibility criteria are met, the Criminal Records Act gives the Parole Board the discretion to deny the record suspension if it would bring the \\"administration of justice into disrepute.\\" To determine this, the Parole Board members may look at the nature and gravity of the offences, the circumstances and the criminal history of the applicant. Proposal to Deny If the Parole Board is considering denying the application, they will give the applicant an opportunity to make further submissions in writing or at an oral hearing. If the record suspension is denied, the applicant must wait one year before applying again. Granted Record Suspension Once the record suspension is granted, the criminal record is kept separate from active records and cannot be disclosed without permission of the Public Safety Minister.  Absolute and Conditional Discharges  Under the Act, a record cannot be disclosed one year after receiving an absolute discharge or three years after receiving a conditional discharge.  Vulnerable Persons  If a person applies for a job or volunteer position that involves working in a position of trust with people who are vulnerable due to age or disability, sexual offences may be disclosed even if a record suspension has been received.  Disclosure  An employer cannot ask about a criminal record for which a Record Suspension has been received. The Parole Board may release decisions, but they must not disclose identifying details without the individual's consent.  Reporting  The Parole Board is required to make an annual report to Parliament about the number of Record Suspensions applications received, ordered and refused, how many suspensions were granted by the offence and any other information the Minister requests.  Changes to the Criminal Records Act  In 2012, the Canadian government changed the name of pardons to record suspension. This reflects the fact that the pardon could be revoked if the person were to re- offend. The Canadian government undertook public consultation on the Criminal Records Act in 2016. The results will be used to inform further changes to the Act.

When his friend, John Jacob Bausch, the owner of a retail optical shop in Rochester, needed additional capital in 1854, he loaned him $60 on Bausch's promise that, if the business ever grew to such an extent that he needed a partner, Lomb would be brought in. The business did grow and together they formed the Bausch & Lomb Company. Lomb enlisted in the 13th New York Volunteer Infantry and fought in the American Civil War as sergeant, lieutenant and captain. When the war ended, he left the military and returned to the company. In 1885, Lomb, along with Max Lowenthal, Ezra R. Andrews, Frank Ritter, William F.

Plot Convicted murderer Seth Baxter wakes up chained to a table beneath a pendulum blade. A videotape informs him that he can release himself by crushing his hands between two presses. He does so, but the blade still swings down and bisects him as someone watches through a hole in the wall. In the present, after being locked in the sickroom at the meatpacking plant by Detective Mark Hoffman, FBI Agent Peter Strahm escapes through a hidden doorway but is attacked in the tunnel by a figure in a pig mask. He wakes up with his head sealed in a box being filled with water but survives by performing a tracheotomy with his pen. Outside, Hoffman delivers Corbett Denlon to the police and claims they are the only survivors but is shocked when Strahm is brought out alive as well. During a press conference, Hoffman is promoted to Detective Lieutenant and credited with closing the Jigsaw case. He finds a note in his office reading \\"I Know Who You Are,\\" and he learns of Agent Lindsey Perez's death while taking Strahm's cell phone from the police evidence room. At the hospital, Strahm tells Hoffman that Perez's last words were \\"Detective Hoffman\\" and questions how he escaped the plant. After being put on medical leave by his boss, Dan Erickson, Strahm, suspicious of Hoffman, decides to uncover his involvement with Jigsaw and takes case files of past Jigsaw victims to research them on his own. In an underground sewer level, five people ‚Äì Ashley, Brit, Charles, Luba, and Mallick ‚Äì awaken with collars locked around their necks, connected by cables to a set of blades mounted on the wall behind them. The keys to the collars are in individual glass boxes across the room. A videotape informs them that they are all connected and need to complete multiple tests to survive; they are also told to \\"do the opposite\\" of their instincts throughout the game. Everyone survives the first game but Ashley, who fails to retrieve a key and gets decapitated when the collars retract. In the second room, which is filled with explosives on a timer, Mallick, Brit, and Luba each retrieve keys to bomb shelters set in the walls, leaving Charles to die when the timer expires and the explosives detonate. In the third room, Brit kills Luba and she and Mallick connect her corpse to five cables to complete an electric circuit that unlocks the next door. In the final room, Mallick and Brit find a machine fitted with five saws and a beaker requiring ten pints of blood to open the final door. They realize that all prior tests could have been completed without victims if they worked together, and figure out their connection: they were all involved in a building fire that killed eight people. Mallick and Brit concede a truce and each slice an arm in the saws to provide the blood needed to open the door. Meanwhile, Strahm learns that Hoffman killed Baxter as revenge for murdering his sister, and made it look like a Jigsaw game to get away with the crime. It is revealed through flashbacks that he was later abducted by John Kramer, who blackmailed Hoffman into becoming his first apprentice. Strahm concludes that everyone was meant to die at the plant except for Corbett and Hoffman, who would appear as a hero. Elsewhere, Strahm's activities draw Erickson's concern, which is further fueled when John's ex-wife Jill Tuck, who received a box and a videotape from John's will, approaches him and claims Strahm is stalking her. After Hoffman tells Erickson about Strahm's theory of a second accomplice, Erickson tries to call him; Hoffman intercepts the call on Strahm's phone and immediately hangs up. Now suspecting that Strahm is involved, Erickson has one of his agents track the phone's signal. Following the signal to an observation room for the sewer game, Erickson finds the phone and his own personnel file, both planted by Hoffman. He also finds the still-living Brit and Mallick and calls for medical attention, before putting an all-points bulletin on Strahm, convinced that he is Jigsaw's successor. Meanwhile, Strahm follows Hoffman to the renovated nerve gas house and finds an underground room containing a box filled with broken glass shards and a tape. In the tape, Hoffman urges Strahm to enter the box, but he stops it short and ambushes Hoffman, whom he seals in the box. Strahm believes he has finally caught Hoffman, but the door to the room shuts itself and the walls begin to close in as the box is lowered into the floor. Strahm finishes playing the tape, which warns him that if he does not enter the box, he will die and everyone will believe he is Jigsaw's apprentice. Hoffman descends safely beneath the floor as Strahm is crushed to death.

Critical reception The film received generally negative reviews from critics. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 13% based on 76 reviews, with a weighted average of 2.92/10. The site's consensus states \\"If its plot were as interesting as its torture devices, or its violence less painful than its performances, perhaps Saw V might not feel like it was running on fumes.\\" Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 20 out of 100, based on 13 reviews. Elizabeth Weizman of the New York Daily News believed that the lack of Tobin Bell's Jigsaw character hurt the film: \\"Bell's deliciously twisted madman was the lifeline of this series and, without him, we're left watching a routine horror flick that might as well have gone straight to DVD. The series began with two major assets that set it apart: the concept of a brilliantly righteous executioner, and the actor who played him. Now, aside from Bell's brief, intermittent cameos, it has neither. So where the original Saw was diabolical fun, this fifth installment is as bloodless as the most unfortunate of Jigsaw's victims.\\" Sam Adams of the Los Angeles Times wrote that \\"The virtues of the individual films are almost beside the point, since it's hard to imagine why anyone would want to pick up the thread at this late date, but Saw V is a particularly dull and discombobulated affair, shot and acted with all the flair of a basic-cable procedural\\".'Saw V' ‚Äì Los Angeles Times Some reviews were positive, however. The British website Digital Spy rated it 3/5 stars and commended the film for its \\"solid acting, slick direction and suitably filthy cinematography too\\", while also stating it will \\"make far more sense to those familiar with the previous installments\\".At The Movies ‚Äì Saw V IGN awarded the film with 3 out of 5 stars stating that the film ties up most of the loose ends of the previous 4 installments while also having a more straightforward and less complicated storyline.

He spent most of his professional career with Mallorca since making his debut in 2004, appearing in 189 competitive matches over eight La Liga seasons. He also spent three years in England, with Wigan Athletic. Club career Mallorca Born in Sa Pobla, Balearic Islands, Ramis was a product of local RCD Mallorca's youth system, having made his debut for the first team in 2003‚Äì04, against Albacete Balompi√© on 15 February 2004 (0‚Äì0 La Liga home draw). After a loan at Real Valladolid from Segunda Divisi√≥n in the 2005‚Äì06 season he developed as a player in 2007‚Äì08, scoring three league goals from a defensive position. On 29 January 2010, Ramis was linked with a move to Scottish giants Celtic, although no agreement could be reached between the two clubs. He finished the campaign with 26 matches ‚Äì and two red cards‚Äì as the side finished fifth and qualified for the UEFA Europa League. Wigan Athletic On 2 August 2012, Ramis signed for Wigan Athletic on a three-year contract after turning down an offer from fellow Premier League club West Ham United. He made his official debut on the 19th, playing the full 90 minutes in a 0‚Äì2 home loss against Chelsea and conceding the penalty that resulted in the last goal for the visitors, scored by Frank Lampard. Ramis scored his first competitive goal for the Latics on 25 September 2012, netting a thunderous 20-yard strike after picking up the ball at the half-way line in a 4‚Äì1 away victory over West Ham United in the League Cup. He found the net against the same opposition one month later, scoring from a left-footed volley in the 2‚Äì1 league home win; he contributed with 16 games and two goals in his debut season, but his team suffered relegation and he also endured a long spell on the sidelines due to a knee injury. In late January 2015, with Wigan still in the Football League Championship, Ramis had his contract cancelled by mutual consent. Levante and Eibar Shortly after leaving Wigan, Ramis returned to his country's top level and signed an 18-month deal with Levante UD. He was released in June 2015, and moved to fellow league team SD Eibar on 20 July. On 20 July 2020, after struggling nearly the entire season with a knee injury, Ramis retired from football aged 35.

University Estate has the postcode 7925. Relation to other suburbs University Estate is bounded by the De Waal Drive to the south, the Eastern Boulevard to the north, and Mountain Road to the west. To the south lie the slopes of Devil's Peak within the Table Mountain National Park, to the north lie Woodstock and Salt River, and to the west lies District 6 ( Walmer Estate). Pedestrian access to Devil's Peak is possible via stairs to De Waal Drive on Kylemore Road and a short walkway on the median between the highway's inbound and outbound lanes. Upper Woodstock and Salt River are reachable from two pedestrian bridges across Eastern Boulevard. Demographics Under the Apartheid Group Areas Act, University Estate was classed as an exclusively \\"white\\" area. Until the early 1990s when F.W. de Klerk's government repealed the Act in June 1991, the suburb was indeed inhabited solely by whites, a large number of the residents being from the Portuguese immigrant community. Over the following years the suburb became popular among wealthier families from previously excluded racial groups. Commerce Since the suburb is zoned almost exclusively for residential use, there are few businesses in the area. Exceptions include 88 Roodebloem Road (a small factory complex adjacent to Eastern Boulevard), a small number of guest lodges scattered throughout the area and some low-impact home businesses. The Cape Town City Council has also approved the rezoning of and subsequent development plans for the premises of the old Rocklands site, but in early 2010 has had to intervene due to unauthorized demolition of the villa.City takes action to restore Rocklands Villa Recreation University Estate has a number of open spaces which are popular among children and dog owners. The play park at the intersection of Rhodes Avenue and Haig Road has see-saws, swings, a merry-go-round, a slide and a jungle gym, which attract younger children. Older children also socialize in this play park, but also make greater use of the undeveloped \\"quarry\\" field just south of the factory complex where they sometimes also ride around on quadbikes. Dog owners tend to prefer this \\"quarry\\" field or the field at the eastern end of the suburb for walking their pets, or may simply walk around the streets. The \\"quarry\\" field and the open areas between the merging highways on the eastern side are also used by \\"Bergies\\" (as homeless people are commonly known in Cape Town) as their \\"home\\".

These funds work by using short selling, trading derivatives such as futures contracts, and other leveraged investment techniques. By providing over short investing horizons and excluding the impact of fees and other costs, performance opposite to their benchmark, inverse ETFs give a result similar to short selling the stocks in the index. An inverse S&P; 500 ETF, for example, seeks a daily percentage movement opposite that of the S&P.; If the S&P; 500 rises by 1%, the inverse ETF is designed to fall by 1%; and if the S&P; falls by 1%, the inverse ETF should rise by 1%. Because their value rises in a declining market environment, they are popular investments in bear markets. Short sales have the potential to expose an investor to unlimited losses, whether or not the sale involves a stock or ETF. An inverse ETF, on the other hand, provides many of the same benefits as shorting, yet it exposes an investor only to the loss of the purchase price. Another advantage of inverse ETFs is that they may be held in IRA accounts, while short sales are not permitted in these accounts.  Systemic impact  Because inverse ETFs and leveraged ETFs must change their notional every day to replicate daily returns (discussed below), their use generates trading, which is generally done at the end of the day, in the last hour of trading. Some have claimed that this trading causes increased volatility , while others argue that the activity is not significant.Weinberg, A. I., \\"Should You Fear the ETF?\\", The Wall Street Journal, Dec 6, 2015. Fees and other issues Fees Inverse and leveraged inverse ETFs tend to have higher expense ratios than standard index ETFs,Anon., ‚ÄúHow Do Inverse ETFs Work?‚Äù, The Motley Fool, Jun 22, 2016. since the funds are by their nature actively managed; these costs can eat away at performance. Short- terms vs. long-term In a market with a long-term upward bias, profit-making opportunities via inverse funds are limited in long time spans.Anon, \\"Inverse Bond Treasury ETF Nears Breakout\\", Yahoo! Finance, June 24, 2014. In addition, a flat or rising market means these funds might struggle to make money. Inverse ETFs are designed to be used for relatively short-term investing as part of a market timing strategy. Volatility loss An inverse ETF, like any leveraged ETF, needs to buy when the market rises and sell when it falls in order to maintain a fixed leverage ratio. This results in a volatility loss proportional to the market variance. Compared to a short position with identical initial exposure, the inverse ETF will therefore usually deliver inferior returns. The exception is if the market declines significantly on low volatility so that the capital gain outweighs the volatility loss. Such large declines benefit the inverse ETF because the relative exposure of the short position drops as the market fall. Since the risk of the inverse ETF and a fixed short position will differ significantly as the index drifts away from its initial value, differences in realized payoff have no clear interpretation. It may therefore be better to evaluate the performance assuming the index returns to the initial level. In that case an inverse ETF will always incur a volatility loss relative to the short position. As with synthetic options, leveraged ETFs need to be frequently rebalanced. In financial mathematics terms, they are not Delta One products: they have Gamma.Kakushadze, Z., & Serur, J. A., 151 Trading Strategies (London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2018), pp. 87‚Äì91. The volatility loss is also sometimes referred to as a compounding error. =Hypothetical examples= If one invests $100 in an inverse ETF position in an asset worth $100, and the asset's value changes the first day to $80, and the following day to $60, then the value of the inverse ETF position will increase by 20% (because the asset decreased by 20% from 100 to 80) and then increase by 25% (because the asset decreased by 25% from 80 to 60). So the ETF's value will be $100*1.20*1.25=$150. The gain of an equivalent short position will however be $100‚Äì$60=$40, and so we see that the capital gain of the ETF outweighs the volatility loss relative to the short position. However, if the market swings back to $100 again, then the net profit of the short position is zero. However, since the value of the asset increased by 67% (from $60 to $100), the inverse ETF must lose 67%, meaning it will lose $100. Thus the investment in shorts went from $100 to $140 and back to $100. The investment in the inverse ETF, however, went from $100 to $150 to $50.Pozen, R., & Hamacher, T., The Fund Industry: How Your Money is Managed (2nd ed.) (Hoboken: Wiley, 2015), pp. 390‚Äì392. An investor in an inverse ETF may correctly predict the collapse of an asset and still suffer heavy losses. For example, if he invests $100 in an inverse ETF position in an asset worth $100, and the asset's value crashes to $1 and the following day it climbs to $2, then the value of the inverse ETF position will drop to zero and the investor would completely lose his investment. If the asset is a class such as the S&P; 500, which has never increased by more than 12% in one day, this would never have happened. =Historical example= For instance, between the close of November 28, 2008 and December 5, 2008, the iShares Dow Jones US Financial () moved from 44.98 to 45.35 (essentially flat, properly an increase of 0.8%), so a double short would have lost 1.6% over that time. However, it varied greatly during the week (dropping to a low of 37.92 on December 1, a daily drop of 15.7%, before recovering over the week), and thus the ProShares UltraShort Financials (), which is a double-short ETF of the IYF moved from 135.05 to 117.18, a loss of 13.2%. =Expected loss= Given that the index follows a geometric Brownian motion and that a fraction x of the fund A_t is invested in the index S_t, the volatility gain of the log return can be seen from the following relation. \\\\Delta \\\\ln(A_t)=x \\\\Delta \\\\ln(S_t)+(x-x^2)\\\\sigma^2\\\\frac{\\\\Delta t}{2} where \\\\sigma^2 is the variance of the index process and the last term on the right hand side constitutes the volatility gain. We see that if x<0 or x>1, as is the case with leveraged ETFs, the return of the fund will be less than x times the index return (the first term on the right hand side).Boudreault, M., & Renaud, J.-F., Actuarial Finance: Derivatives, Quantitative Models and Risk Management (Hoboken: Wiley, 2019), p. 394.

Anzia's uncle, Meyer Yeziersky/Max Mayer was the first of his family to immigrate to the US. Anzia arrived in 1901 after the rest of the family had joined him in adopting his first name as their surname in the US. Her success with novels and a film encouraged her niece and grandniece.

The fort, which is now a regional museum of the National Museum of the Philippines, is a major landmark of the city and symbol of its cultural heritage. Outside the eastern wall is a Marian shrine dedicated to Our Lady of the Pillar, the patroness of the city. History Spanish Colonial Period =Establishment= Illustration of Zamboanga and Fort Pilar, detail from the Carta Hydrographica y Chorographica de las Yslas Filipinas, 1734 In 1635, upon the requests of the Jesuit missionaries and Bishop Fray Pedro of Cebu, the Spanish governor of the Philippines Juan Cerezo de Salamanca (1633‚Äì1635) approved the building of a stone fort in defense against pirates and raiders of the sultans of Mindanao and Jolo. The cornerstone of the fort, originally called Real Fuerza de San Jos√© (Royal Fort of Saint Joseph), was laid by Melchor de Vera, a Jesuit priest-engineer, on June 23, 1635, which also marks the founding of Zamboanga as a city, then known as Jambangan.\\"Zamboanga City History\\". Zamboanga.com. Retrieved on 2011-07-02. The construction of the early fort continued within the governorship of Sebasti√°n Hurtado de Corcuera (1635‚Äì1644), ex-governor of Panama. Because of insufficient manpower, laborers from Cavite, Cebu, Bohol, and Panay had to be imported to help the Spaniards, Mexicans and Peruvians in the construction of the fort. This period also marks the beginning of the Zamboangue√±o Chavacano as a pidgin that eventually developed into a full-fledged creole language for Zamboangue√±os. =Early attacks= Fort San Jos√© was attacked by the Dutch in 1646 and was later abandoned by the Spanish troops who went back to Manila in 1662 to help fight the Chinese pirate Koxinga who had earlier defeated the Dutch. In 1669, the Jesuit missionaries rebuilt the fort after pirates and raiders had again destroyed it. In 1718‚Äì1719, it was rebuilt by the Spaniard engineer Juan Sicarra upon the orders of Spanish Governor General Fernando Manuel de Bustillo Bustamante y Rueda and was renamed as Real Fuerza de Nuestra Se√±ora del Pilar de Zaragoza (Royal Fort of Our Lady of the Pillar of Zaragoza) in honor of the patron virgin of Spain, Our Lady of the Pillar. A year later Dalasi, king of Bulig, and 3,000 Moro pirates attacked the fort; the defenders repulsed the attack. The relief of Our Lady of the Pillar In 1798 the British Royal Navy bombarded the fort but again it proved robust enough to repel the attack. Fort Pilar was the scene of a mutiny of 70 prisoners in 1872. =Marian apparitions= It was in 1734 when a relief of Our Lady of the Pillar was placed above the eastern wall of the fort making it an outdoor shrine with an altar for praying. According to tradition, the Virgin Mary appeared to a soldier on December 6, 1734, at the gate of the city. The soldier asked her to stop. Upon recognizing her, he fell down to his knees. On September 21, 1897 at 1:14 PM in the afternoon, a strong earthquake struck the western region of Mindanao. The Virgin Mary made an apparition, and according to the people who witnessed it, they saw the virgin standing mid-air over the Basilan Strait. She had her right hand raised to signal the onrushing waves to stop, saving the city from a tsunami.\\"Muslims and Christians venerate Our Lady of the Pillar\\" . Inquirer.net.

On November 19, 1899, the fort was captured by U.S. expeditionary forces. Fort Pilar Historical Marker Aerial View Fort Pilar World War II During World War II in 1942, Japanese forces captured and took control of the fort. It was recaptured by the United States and Filipino troops on March 1945 and was finally and officially turned over to the government of the Republic of the Philippines on July 4, 1946. Restoration of the Fort Fort Pilar was recognized as a National Cultural Treasure on August 1, 1973 by Presidential Decree No. 260, though by then the fort had been in disrepair since World War II. Restoration was started in the early part of 1980 by the National Museum of the Philippines, which reconstructed three of the four structures inside the fort. After six years of rehabilitation work, the museum branch opened its doors to the public with a special exhibit on Philippine Contemporary Art. In October 1987, a permanent exhibit on the marine life of Zamboanga, Basilan and Sulu was opened at the second floor of Structure II showing 400 species of marine life specimens in giant dioramas. Also opened was a special exhibit on the 18th century relics from the Griffin Shipwreck at the ground floor, which coincided with the formal inauguration of the structure.

Naval career He was the younger son of Lt-Gen. Richard Onslow and his wife Pooley, daughter of Charles Walton.Sir Richard Onslow at Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Onslow's uncle was Arthur Onslow, Speaker of the House of Commons, and he enjoyed considerable interest as he rapidly rose through the Navy. He was made fourth lieutenant of the Sunderland on 17 December 1758 by V-Adm. George Pocock, fifth lieutenant of the Grafton on 3 March 1759, and fourth lieutenant of Pocock's flagship, the Yarmouth on 17 March 1760, upon which he returned to England. Onslow became commander of the Martin on 11 February 1761, cruising in the Skagerrak until his promotion to captain of the Humber on 14 April 1762. He joined the Humber in June, but she was wrecked off Flamborough Head while returning from the Baltic in September. Onslow was court-martialed for her loss, but was acquitted, the pilot being blamed for the wreck. On 29 November 1762, he was appointed to command the Phoenix. Onslow did not receive another command until 31 October 1776, when he was appointed to the St Albans. He took a convoy to New York City in April 1777 and joined Lord Howe in time for the repulse of d'Estaing on 22 July 1777 at Sandy Hook. Onslow sailed for the West Indies on 4 November 1778 with Commodore Hotham, and took part in the capture of Saint Lucia and its defense against d'Estaing that December at the Cul-de-Sac. In August 1779, he brought a convoy from St Kitts to Spithead. He was placed in command of the Bellona, in the Channel Fleet under Admiral Francis Geary, in February 1780, and captured the Dutch 54-gun ship Prinses Carolina on 30 December 1780. Onslow took part in the Relief of Gibraltar under Admiral Darby in April 1781, and again under Howe in October 1782. The Bellona captured La Solitaire in the West Indies before Onslow returned home and took half-pay in June 1783. In early 1789, he was appointed to command the Magnificent at Portsmouth, but was out of employment again in September 1791. He was promoted rear-admiral of the white on 1 February 1793 and vice-admiral on 4 July 1794. In 1796, he was made port admiral at Portsmouth, and in November, he went aboard the Nassau to act as second-in-command of the North Sea Fleet under Admiral Duncan. During the Spithead and Nore mutinies, Onslow suppressed a rising aboard the Nassau, and was sent by Duncan to quell the Adamant. When the Nassau refused to sail on 26 May 1797, Onslow moved his flag to the Adamant and until the end of the mutiny, Duncan (in the Venerable) and Onslow maintained the blockade off the Texel alone, making signals to an imaginary fleet over the horizon. Onslow moved his flag again to the Monarch on 25 July 1797, and it was aboard her that he took part in the Battle of Camperdown on 11 October 1797. His flag captain, Edward O'Bryen, supposedly warned him that the Dutch ships were too close together to get between, to which Onslow replied \\"The Monarch will make a passage.\\" Indeed, Monarch was the first to break the Dutch line and attack the Jupiter of 72 guns, flagship of Vice-Admiral Reyntjes, who subsequently surrendered to Onslow. The victory was captured by the artist Thomas Rowlandson, a friend of Onslow's brother-in-law, Matthew Michell, in the painting \\"Glorious Defeat of the Dutch Navy Octr 10 1797, by Admirals Lord Duncan and Sir Richard Onslow, with a View Drawn on the Spot of the Six Dutch Line of Battle Ships Captured and Brought into Yarmouth\\". For his exertions at Camperdown, Onslow was created a baronet and presented with the Freedom of the City of London. He became Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth in 1796.Bodmin Moor, Chapter 11 He went on sick leave on 10 December 1798 and retired as Commander- in-Chief, Plymouth a few weeks later. He was promoted Admiral of the Red on 9 November 1805 and received the GCB in 1815. He died on 27 December 1817 at Southampton aged 76 years. A medal, struck in Birmingham to commemorate Camperdown Family In 1765, Onslow, known for his conviviality, was a founder of the Navy Society dining club. On 18 January 1766, he was appointed to command the frigate Aquilon in the Mediterranean, which he did until 1769, and from 12 October 1770, commanded the Diana in the West Indies. Admiral Rodney gave him command of Achilles on 18 January 1773, in which he returned to England, where he acquired an estate and married Anne, daughter of Commodore Matthew Michell of Chitterne, Wiltshire.

McCoog, ‚ÄòMartin, Gregory (1542?‚Äì1582)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 ‚Äì 28 October 1582) was an English Catholic Priest, a noted scholar of his time, academic and Doctor of Divinity, and served as the chief translator of the Rheims and Douai Version of the Bible, the first full, official Catholic English Bible translation, translated from the Latin Vulgate. In preparing the translation he was assisted by several of the other scholars then living in the English College, Douai, the most noteworthy of which were Thomas Worthington, Richard Bristowe, William Rainolds (Reynolds), and William Cardinal Allen, but Father Martin made the whole translation in the first instance and bore the brunt of the work throughout. Life He was born in Maxfield, a parish of Guestling, near Winchelsea, in Sussex, an historic county of South East England, and entered as one of the original scholars of St John's College, Oxford, in 1557. Among those who also entered at the beginning was Edmund Campion, the Jesuit martyr; at this period of his life, he conformed to the Established Anglican Church, and was ordained as a deacon. Campion was Martin's close friend throughout his Oxford days, and he remained a Catholic. When he found it necessary to quit the university, he was tutor in the family of the Duke of Norfolk, where he had among his pupils Philip, Earl of Arundel, also subsequently martyred. During his residence with the Duke, Martin wrote to Campion, warning him that he was being led away into danger by his ambition, and begging him to leave Oxford. It is said that it was in great measure due to this advice that Campion migrated to Dublin in 1570, and accepted a post in the university there. In the meantime, Gregory Martin left the house of the Duke of Norfolk, and crossing the seas, presented himself at Dr Allen's College at Douai as a candidate for the priesthood, in 1570. During his early days there, he wrote once more to Campion, and they met at Douai. Campion was now a professed Catholic, and he received minor orders and the subdiaconate, after which he proceeded to Rome and eventually entered the Society of Jesus. Having finished his theology, Gregory Martin was ordained priest in March 1573. Three years later he went to Rome to assist Allen in the foundation of the English College there, known by the title of the \\"Venerabile.\\" Martin remained two years, during which time he organised the course of studies at the new college; when he was recalled by Allen to Reims, where the college had moved from Douai in consequence of political troubles. Martin and Campion met for the last time, when the latter made a short stay at Reims in the summer of 1580, on his way to the English Mission. It was during the four years after his return to Reims from Rome (1578‚Äì1582) that Father Martin settled to a Catholic translation of the Bible. The Reformers continually quoted their versions; Allen wanted to meet them on their own ground. He determined to attempt the work at his college, and deputed Martin to undertake the translation. Thomas Worthington, Richard Bristow, William Rainolds, and Allen himself were to assist in revising the text and preparing suitable notes to the passages which were most used by the Protestants. It was accuracy of rendering which was chiefly needed by the controversial exigencies of the day. Martin's translation was made from the Vulgate, and is full of Latinisms, so that it has little of the rhythmic harmony of the Anglican Authorized Version: but in accuracy and scholarship, it was superior to the English versions which had preceded it, and it is understood to have had influence on the translators of King James's Version. In many cases in which they did not follow the Douai, the editors of the Revised Version have upheld Martin's translation. The Reims New Testament first appeared in 1582. The Old Testament was not published till more than a quarter of a century later. This, however, was solely due to want of funds. It was not called for with such urgency, and its publication was put off from year to year. But it was all prepared at the same time as the New Testament, and by the same editors. Father Martin was found to be in consumption, a lethal form of tuberculosis. In the hope of saving his life, Allen sent him to Paris, but the disease was past cure. He returned to Reims to die, and he was buried in the parish church of St Stephen. Allen preached the funeral discourse, and had a long Latin inscription put on the tomb of his friend. The English Catholic printer William Carter was executed in 1584 for having printed Martin's \\"A Treatise of Schisme\\". A paragraph in which Martin expressed confidence that \\"the Catholic Hope would triumph, and pious Judith would slay Holofernes\\" was interpreted as an incitement to slay Queen Elizabeth I, though in all likelihood this paragraph was just a metaphor representing the Holy Mother Church as Judith slaying the perceived heretics, the Protestants.

It consolidated all existing child protection legislation for England and Wales into one act. It was preceded by the Children and Young Persons Act 1920 and the Children Act 1908. It is modified by the Children and Young Persons Act 1963, the Children and Young Persons Act 1969 and the Children and Young Persons Act 2008.  Content  The Children and Young Persons Act 1933 raised the minimum age for execution to eighteen, raised the age of criminal responsibility from seven to eight, included guidelines on the employment of school-age children, set a minimum working age of fourteen, and made it illegal for adults to sell cigarettes or other tobacco products to children. The act is worded to ensure that adults and not children are responsible for enforcing it. In 1932 a 16 year juvenile Harold Wilkins was sentenced to death for murder, though the death sentence was commuted.  History  The act was passed a year after the Children and Young Persons Act 1932 broadened the powers of juvenile courts and introduced supervision orders for children at risk. Some sections of the act concerning the employment of children are still in force today. S39. and 49 of the Act remains in everyday use in order to protect the identity of juvenile defendants appearing in Courts in England and Wales. Section 39 and 49: information for journalists Sections 39 and 49 are used to protect the identity of children and young people who appear in court as witnesses, victims and suspects. Journalists may not give the following about the accused: *Their name *Address *School *Still or moving image; or *Any particulars likely to lead to the identification of any person aged under 18 concerned in the proceedings. The differences between the sections are that Section 39 is discretionary, but section 49 is automatically given in the youth courts. However, it can be waived in the following circumstances: * If it is counterproductive to the defence of the accused. For example, they need people to come forward to say the accused was at a meeting in London when the crime was committed in Liverpool. Also, if the accused is using a defence of mistaken identity. * If the police need to trace someone who is accused of an offence that warrants a sentence of 14 years imprisonment or more, the press can publish and broadcast details. There is an unofficial defence to the Contempt of Court Act 1981 that allows for police appeals, which will not be prosecuted if done in reasonable terms. * If it is in the public interest to identify them, as a warning to others who may commit a similar offence. Especially if an ASBO has been issued to the convicted offender, as the publicity is essential to its enforcement. However, ASBOs were abolished and superseded in 2015. These only apply once proceedings are activated by an arrest or a summons issued.

Other terms for this operation include: lumpectomy, wide local excision, segmental resection, tylectomy, and quadrantectomy. BCS has been increasingly accepted as an alternative to mastectomy in specific patients, as it provides tumor removal while maintaining an acceptable cosmetic outcome. This page reviews the history of this operation, important considerations in decision making and patient selection, and the emerging field of oncoplastic breast conservation surgery. Medical uses For clinical stages I and II breast cancer, breast-conserving surgery, with radiotherapy and possibly chemotherapy may be indicated if one or two sentinel lymph nodes are found to have cancer which is not extensive. In this case, the sentinel lymph nodes would be examined, and lymphadenectomy as further evaluation is not indicated as this result from the sentinel lymph nodes is sufficient to recommend treatment. BCS may also be used in cases of biopsy-proven invasive breast cancer or biopsy-proven ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). In the assessment of the tumor, the surgeon should assess the ability to resect the tumor with clear margins while providing a cosmetic result that is acceptable to the patient. Shared decision-making is an important consideration in breast-conserving surgery. It is estimated that between 50% and 70% of patients are active participants in the decision making of breast cancer surgery. The time following a cancer diagnosis may be filled with fear, vulnerability, and a sense of being overwhelmed at the amount of information being provided by physicians as well as accessed on the internet. Each patient has their own set of unique characteristics, which may make it challenging to read information online and apply that information to a specific individual circumstance. In addition, there are several important misconceptions regarding breast-conservation surgery for patients and clinicians to keep in mind. # In appropriately selected patients, mastectomy and breast-conserving surgery have equivalent survival rates. # Undergoing mastectomy does not eliminate the risk for recurrent or new cancer. # Radiation therapy may still be needed following breast-conservation surgery. # The decision regarding the need for chemotherapy is independent from the surgical options. Contraindications Absolute contraindications, which are reasons why the procedure absolutely cannot be done, include: # Pregnancy is an absolute contraindication to the use of breast irradiation. In some cases, it may be possible to perform breast-conserving surgery in the third trimester and treat the patient with radiation after delivery. # Two or more primary tumors in separate quadrants of the breast or with diffuse malignant-appearing microcalcifications. # A history of prior therapeutic irradiation to the breast that would require re-treatment to an excessively high total dose. # Persistent positive margins after reasonable surgical attempts: the importance of a single focally positive microscopic margin needs further study and may not be an absolute contraindication. #Inflammatory breast cancer #Diffuse or indeterminate micro-calcifications on mammography Relative contraindications encompass situations of higher risk of complications to the patient that may be outweighed by other considerations, such as the benefit to the patient. Relative contraindications include: # Previous breast radiation therapy # Connective tissue disease such as Scleroderma, Sjogren Syndrome, Lupus, and Rheumatoid arthritis may result in an increased risk of radiation toxicity. # Very large tumor size relative to breast volume. Oncoplastic surgery Oncoplastic surgery is an important consideration in breast-conserving surgery that integrates plastic surgery principles into breast cancer surgery in order to preserve aesthetic outcomes and quality of life, without compromising local control of the cancer. It is based on three surgical principles: ideal breast cancer surgery with free tumor margins, immediate breast reconstruction, and immediate symmetry with the other breast. Oncoplastic approaches to breast- conserving surgery may require a close partnership among surgeons who specialize in surgical oncology and plastic surgery. Oncoplastic surgery is not only limited to breast-conserving surgery, as the techniques and principles of plastic surgery can be applied to mastectomy as well. As of 2017, there had been no randomized controlled trials to compare oncoplastic breast-conserving surgery to traditional breast conserving surgery techniques.  History  Prior to 1981, there existed limited evidence that breast- conserving surgery was an acceptable alternative to radical mastectomy for treatment of early stage breast cancer. Dr. Umberto Veronesi, an Italian oncologist, challenged this notion and led a clinical trial comparing the radical mastectomy with breast-conserving surgery (which was termed quadrantectomy at the time).

It is located within the Roman Catholic Diocese of Great Falls-Billings and serves students from Crow and Northern Cheyenne tribes. Background The founding of St. Labre Indian School in 1884 was one of the first efforts to care for Native Americans who had been displaced as a result of homesteading. George Yoakum, a former soldier who had been stationed near Miles City, Montana, recognized the hard times experienced by the Northern Cheyenne. He contacted John Brondel, Bishop of Helena, and told him of Indian people who were roaming the Tongue River Valley without homes or land--a reservation had not yet been set aside as their land. Land was purchased by the Bishop, and on March 29, 1884, St. Labre Indian School, named for St. Benedict Joseph Labre, became a reality. The school has an unrated profile on Charity Navigator (https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.profile&ein;=810244542) and has found itself the subject of litigation (brought against it by the Northern Cheyenne Tribe). The Northern Cheyenne Tribe questions the school's use of millions of dollars while in service to a limited number of actual tribe members (http://citizensalliance.org/charities). The Tribal Council settled litigation with St. Labre School for annual payments of $65,000 from the school, which members of the tribe have claimed the Tribal Council misappropriated. There have been demonstrations and protests by Northern Cheyenne Tribe members against its Tribal Council.

Walker returned to Detroit, taught school at the university and then began the study of law in the office of Joy & Parker. He then studied for a year under Judge Story at Harvard and was admitted to the bar in 1845. He returned to Detroit to practice law and in 1850 practiced with his brother Charles I. Walker under C.

In the 1936 Berlin Olympics, he won the gold medal in the 10 meter platform competition as well as the silver medal in the 3 meter springboard event. After the war he was an exhibition diver for Billy Rose's Aquacades. He was the Commanding officer of Lockheed P-38 Lightings in World War II for the 7th Photo Reconnaissance Squadron, and in 1945 he aborted his de Haviland Mosquito plane and landed in Italy. After the war he was a pilot, navigator and captain for PanAm Airlines. He was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fall in 1982, in Ft. Lauderdale, FL. Born of parents in the Vaudeville troupe that toured the east coast of the US, Marshall began performing at a very young age. Taught by the acrobats of the Vaudeville acts long before he began to dive, Marshall took an interest to tumbling. When he was a teen at Miami High, he snuck in the Venetian pool in Coral Gables, and his diving career began. By the time he was 18, he was diving and performing at the Biltmore Hotel on Miami Beach, entertaining for the socialites and visiting guests. He won a number of AAU diving awards including first place in the 1934 & 1936 AAU Championships. He attended two years of college, at the University of Miami, then participated in the 1936 Berlin Olympics, with no international diving experience. He captured the gold medal in the men‚Äôs 10 meter platform, and silver in the 3 meter springboard. He angered Adolf Hitler as his favorite diver, Hermann Stork was predicted to win. A heated discussion between the German dictator and Wayne ensued, and was recounted by several family members. In fact, the US Olympic diving teams (men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs), won 10 out of 12 possible medals in those games. After the Olympics Marshall performed for Billy Rose‚Äôs Aquacades, with the likes of Esther Williams, Johnny Weissmuller, Buster Crabbe, Eleanor Holm and others. He then enlisted in the Army Air Corp and became the Commanding Officer of the 7th Photo Reconnaissance Group out of Mt. Farm, England. Col. Wayne was injured in a flight accident and parachuted out of his plane, only to land in a tree while damaging his leg. He was taken in by an Italian family, and later smuggled out of Italy to England. After the war he appeared in ads for Camel cigarettes, Havoline motor oil, BVD underwear and others. Marshall lived his life like he dove---he jumped from the platform with confidence that the water below would break his fall. If there was a ripple of uncertainty in his life, it was quickly lost in the smooth entry into the unknown. With his blond hair, tan tall physic and confident style, he was a master of his surroundings. Marshall was gifted in many ways. Although his raw talent was diving, his real talent was his high level of intelligence. Yes, his uncharacteristic good looks got him noticed. However, his ability to lead others in competition, battle and life were his real strengths. Marshall Wayne lived a colorful life, filled with great achievements, service to our country, and celebrity status. https://www.si.com/more-sports/2015/05/25/memorial-day-dive-bombers-frank- kurtz-marshall-wayne-olympics External links *profile * https://www.si.com/more-sports/2015/05/25/memorial-day-dive-bombers-frank- kurtz-marshall-wayne-olympics 1912 births 1999 deaths Olympic divers of the United States Divers at the 1936 Summer Olympics Olympic gold medalists for the United States in diving Olympic silver medalists for the United States in diving American male divers Medalists at the 1936 Summer Olympics ","title":"Marshall Wayne"},{"id":"14385276","text":"Francis Vernon, 1st Earl of Shipbrook (1715 ‚Äì 15 October 1783), known as The Lord Orwell between 1762 and 1776 and as The Viscount Orwell between 1776 and 1777, was an English politician.

Plot A fifteen-year-old boy named Garrett is picked up by a pair of bounty hunters and sent to a boot camp in upstate New York called Lake Harmony. Upon his arrival, he learns that his parents have sent him to the facility because he refused to stop having intimate relationships with his former math teacher that was eight years older than him, Sabrina, along with other things including staying out too late, not being athletic enough, and occasionally smoking weed. Garrett is an incredibly bright and clever kid, although he tends to miss school as he thinks that he does not need to attend daily to uphold his grades. His parents are at most, distant. Garrett does not believe he belongs at Lake Harmony, but he is not allowed to leave until he has admitted his \\"mistakes\\" and conforms to the facility's standards of behavior. Staff members are authorized to use \\"any force necessary\\" to alter his behaviour, including physical and psychological abuse. After attempting to talk his way out with no success, he realizes escape is his only option. He escapes Lake Harmony with two friends, Pauly and Sarah, after using chemicals to start a fire. They reach the Canada‚ÄìUS border to escape from legal recapture, and their pursuers' boat begins to sink. He lets his friends out on the other side of the border, and then rescues his pursuers, who bring him back to Lake Harmony, where he is beaten senseless repeatedly. The director announces that all campers are being demoted, based on the privilege system they use, and to blame Garrett, so he is beaten yet again by the campers. Ultimately, he is \\"reformed\\". He begins to believe in the treatment, feeling no remorse when those around him are abused. When his mother comes to pick him up with an investigator, the investigator asks if he was beaten. He breaks down and says that he was, but deserved it. It is possible that these events caused him to suffer from PTSD, as he appears to suffer from a mental breakdown when admitting what has occurred.

She was modernized between 1897 and 1898, which included removing her center main battery gun and barbette and installing a battery of light quick-firing guns in its place. After returning to service, she was transferred to the Northern Squadron, based in the English Channel, where the routine of peacetime training maneuvers continued. Withdrawn from active duty in 1903, she briefly saw service in 1904 but was again removed from use thereafter and was stricken from the naval register in 1911 before being broken up thereafter. Design Right elevation, deck plan, and hull section of the Amiral Baudin class Amiral Baudin and Formidable were designed in the late 1870s as part of a naval construction program that began under the post-Franco-Prussian War fleet plan of 1872. By 1877, the Italian fleet under Benedetto Brin had begun building powerful new ironclads of the and es, which demanded a French response, beginning with the ironclad of 1877. The Italian vessels carried significantly larger guns than Amiral Duperr√©, which prompted calls from the Chamber of Deputies to increase the caliber of future ship armament. This resulted in the development of the gun used in the Amiral Baudin class, which was in most other respects, similar to Amiral Duperr√©. Formidable was long at the waterline, with a beam of and a draft of . She displaced . She was fitted with a pair of pole masts equipped with spotting tops for her main battery guns. The crew consisted of 625 officers and enlisted men. Her propulsion machinery consisted of two compound steam engines with steam provided by twelve coal-burning fire-tube boilers. Her engines were rated to produce for a top speed of . Her main armament consisted of three , 28-caliber guns mounted in individual barbette mounts, one forward, one amidships, and one aft, all on the centerline. These guns were supported by a secondary battery of four and eight or ten guns, all carried in individual pivot mounts. For defense against torpedo boats, she carried one 3-pounder gun, twelve 47 mm 3-pounder Hotchkiss revolver cannon, and eighteen 1-pounder Hotchkiss revolvers, all in individual mounts. Her armament was rounded out with six torpedo tubes in above-water mounts. The ship was protected with a combination of mild steel and compound armor; her belt was thick and extended for the entire length of the hull. The barbettes for the main battery were thick and the supporting tubes were also 406 mm. Her conning tower was thick. Service history Construction ‚Äì 1895 Formidable testing a captive balloon in 1890 Formidable was built at the Lorient shipyard, and her keel was laid down in September 1879. She was launched in April 1885 and was completed in February 1889. Formidable served in the 1st Division, Mediterranean Squadron in 1889, along with her sister , and Amiral Duperr√©. She took part in the annual fleet maneuvers that year in company with her division-mates and six other ironclads, along with numerous smaller craft. Formidable served as part of the French force during the maneuvers, which lasted from 30 June to 6 July. During the 1890 fleet maneuvers, the ship served in the 1st Division of the 1st Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet. At the time, the division also included the ironclads and Amiral Duperr√©. The ships concentrated off Oran, French Algeria on 22 June and then proceeded to Brest, France, arriving there on 2 July for combined operations with the ships of the Northern Squadron. The exercises began four days later and concluded on 25 July, after which Formidable and the rest of the Mediterranean Fleet returned to Toulon. That year, she was took part in experiments with a tethered observation balloon for spotting purposes at sea. During the fleet maneuvers of 1891, which began on 23 June, Formidable remained with the 1st Division, 1st Squadron along with Courbet and the ironclad . The maneuvers lasted until 11 July. The ship remained in service with the Mediterranean Fleet in 1892, which by that time had been joined by the three s. She participated in the 1893 maneuvers, again as part of the 1st Division in company with Courbet and the ironclad . This year, Formidable served as the fleet flagship, hosting Vice Admiral Louis Vignes. The maneuvers included an initial period of exercises from 1 to 10 July and then larger-scale maneuvers from 17 to 28 July. She remained in the 1st Squadron in 1895, by which time it had been reduced in size to Amiral Baudin, Formidable, the three Marceaus, Courbet, and D√©vastation. On 13 November, while the fleet was entering Hy√®res, Formidable, leading the line, failed to turn in accordance with the instructions of the fleet commander, Vice Admiral Alfred Gervais. She turned too widely and ran aground on a shoal that had formed since the most recent hydrographic survey. The line of ships fell into disarray; the second ship, , managed to turn in time, but Amiral Baudin also ran aground and Courbet brushed the sea floor. Formidable was pulled free later that night and a subsequent inquiry absolved Gervais of responsibility for the accident. Despite the grounding, Formidable was not damaged in the accident. 1896‚Äì1911 Formidable after her refit Formidable remained in active service with the Mediterranean Fleet in 1896. She was withdrawn from service the next year to be modernized, including the removal of her central main battery gun, which was replaced with a battery of four 163 mm guns in open single mounts. She also received new boilers, which allowed her to use mix oil and coal firing. Work on the ship was completed in 1898. She participated in the fleet maneuvers that year, which lasted from 5 to 25 July. By 1899, Formidable had become obsolescent as more modern pre- dreadnought battleships built in the mid-1890s had entered service. As a result, she was assigned to the less strategically significant Northern Squadron in the English Channel, along with Amiral Baudin, Amiral Duperr√©, D√©vastation, Courbet, and Redoutable. The next year, two of these new battleships‚Äî and ‚Äîjoined Formidable in the Northern Squadron, which at that time also included Amiral Baudin, Redoutable, and Amiral Duperr√©, though the latter two vessels were withdrawn from service to be modernized that year. In June and July that year, she participated in extensive joint maneuvers conducted with the Mediterranean Fleet. The Northern Squadron initially held its own maneuvers in Brest, which included a simulated blockade of the squadron in Brest, after which the squadron made mock attacks on the island of Belle √éle and nearby Quiberon. In early July, the squadron met the Mediterranean Squadron off Lisbon, Portugal before the two units steamed north to Quiberon Bay and entered Brest on 9 July. Formidable and the rest of the Northern Squadron were tasked with conducting a mock attack on Cherbourg two days later. The maneuvers concluded with a naval review in Cherbourg on 19 July for President √âmile Loubet. The Northern Squadron remained unchanged for 1901, apart from the addition of the ironclad . During the fleet maneuvers that year, the Northern Squadron steamed south for joint maneuvers with the Mediterranean Fleet. The Northern Squadron ships formed part of the hostile force, and as it was entering the Mediterranean from the Atlantic, represented a German squadron attempting to meet its Italian allies. The exercises began on 3 July and concluded on 28 July. In August and September, the Northern Squadron conducted amphibious assault exercises. On 28 August, they escorted a group of troop ships from Brest to La Rochelle, which the ships bombarded, neutralized the coastal defenses, and put some 6,000 men ashore. The next year, the squadron was reorganized, leaving Formidable, Mass√©na, and Courbet in the unit that year, along with four coastal defense ships. Formidable was laid up out of service in 1903, but she returned to active service with the Northern Squadron the following year, though only briefly, as she was decommissioned after the battleships Carnot and were transferred to the unit. The ship was stricken from the naval register in 1911 and subsequently broken up for scrap.

It was a spin off from DNAgents, which was also written by Evanier. Plot The series featured the adventures of a Los Angeles bail bondsman named Jay Endicott; Endicott assumed the identity of the original Crossfire, a notorious criminal, who was murdered in the midst of one of his crimes. Endicott decided to use the costume to fight crime as a superhero while impersonating the original to take advantage of his reputation to secure, and then hunt down, underworld contacts. The original Crossfire, Jeff Baker, first appeared in DNAgents #4. Jay Endicott first appeared in DNAgents #9. In an early adventure, Endicott met the DNAgents and fell in love with their member, Rainbow. He was also seriously wounded and while in the care of the Agents' organization, he was given specific enhancements to his body such as replacing his blood with an artificial chemical that mimics the characteristics of blood more efficiently. In addition to the superhero adventures, Evanier used his considerable experience in the Hollywood entertainment industry to feature secondary stories of characters trying to work and survive in that business. Evanier also contributed lengthy essays on the subject in each issue with illustrations by Sergio Aragones, a tradition continued in the later series, Hollywood Superstars for Epic Comics. The character Jay Endicott was also the lead in a short-lived spin-off from Eclipse Comics, \\"Whodunnit?\\". Lasting for three issues, the book featured \\"fair play\\" whodunit murder mystery tales solved by Crossfire's civil identity as a bailout officer and invited readers to submit their guesses for later publication and comment. Publication History The series originally ran for 26 issues, but sold poorly. This prompted a change of format from color to black and white printing to reduce expense. In turn, the series took a more realistic tone to the stories such as Endicott having to make do with only his mask after he was forced to destroy the rest of his costume to escape police custody. In 1994 Antarctic Press published a one shot flip book DNAgents Super Special that included a new Crossfire story by Evanier and Spiegle. About Comics in 2004 released a black and white digest size collection of the first five issues (plus one issue of the tie-in series Whodunnit?) under the title Crossfire Volume 1: Hollywood Hero.

During the 1920s several of his plays were produced, most notably Nazar the Brave, a rags-to- riches comedy about a folkloric figure which is based on a collation of over 60 sources by the poet Tumanian. Described by Demirchian as a play for ‚Äúchildlike adults and adultlike children,‚Äù Nazar the Brave was first performed in 1924. It was subsequently given professional productions in Yerevan, Tiflis and Baku, made into an opera and later a film (1940).

After the death of their parents, his older brother Arthur bought him a captain's commission in the British Army. He first saw action in the Anglo-Spanish War in 1727, after which he was returned to Parliament for the family borough of Guildford. His political contributions were negligible in comparison to his brother, and he continued to serve as a career officer, holding commands in the War of the Austrian Succession at Dettingen and Fontenoy. In 1759, he was appointed Governor of Plymouth and commander of the Western District, and died as a lieutenant-general the following year while presiding over two prominent courts-martial. Early life He was the second son of Foot Onslow, Member of Parliament for Guildford. His older brother was Arthur Onslow, Speaker of the House of Commons from 1728 to 1761, and after the death of his father in 1710 and his mother in 1715, he and his four sisters were left in Arthur's care. As Richard had not been educated for the law or the church, Arthur thought, against the opinion of their friends, that Richard's courage and bodily stature suited him for the army. Accordingly, Arthur raised the money to allow Richard to purchase a commission as a captain in the 11th Regiment of Foot on 14 July 1716, a rank that allowed him to maintain his social standing among the rest of the family. Writing late in life, Arthur noted that Richard had \\"risen to be very high in the army...and with unblemished character in it\\", validating his choice. When Arthur entered Parliament for the family borough of Guildford in 1720, he gave up to Richard the post of receiver general of the Post Office, which was not compatible with a Parliamentary seat and paid almost ¬£400 per year. Richard exchanged into the 30th Regiment of Foot in 1719 and the 15th Regiment of Foot in 1721. During the 1722 election at Haslemere, where the Onslows had an interest, Richard became involved in a brawl with James Oglethorpe. Oglethorpe and his fellow Tory candidate Peter Burrell came upon Onslow and his companion, a Mr. Sharp. Burrell complained of Sharp's insulting electioneering practices, and Oglethorpe struck Sharp with his cane; when Onslow attempted to interpose, Oglethorpe drew on him. Onslow was injured in the thigh, but disarmed Oglethorpe; he was wounded again in the left hand when Oglethorpe attempted to recover his sword, but by now his temper had cooled, and he helped bind Onslow's wounds and summoned a surgeon for him. Onslow was promoted to captain lieutenant (and lieutenant-colonel in the Army) in the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards on 7 July 1724. On 9 December 1726, he married his brother's sister-in-law, Rose Bridges, daughter and coheiress of John Bridges of Thames Ditton. She died in 1728 without children, and in 1730, he married again to Pooley Walton, daughter of Charles Walton and heiress of her uncle George Walton. They had four children: *George Onslow (1731‚Äì1792) *Sir Richard Onslow, 1st Baronet (1741‚Äì1817) *Rev. Arthur Onslow (1746‚Äì1815) *Elizabeth Onslow (d. 1800 or 1802), married Rev. Hon. George Hamilton and had issue. Active service and politics On 9 March 1727, Onslow succeeded Richard Hele Treby as captain of one of the Guards companies sent to reinforce besieged Gibraltar. The Spanish lifted the siege in June, and Onslow then stood for Guildford on his family's interest, replacing Thomas Brodrick. Onslow was elected alongside his brother (who, however, chose to sit for Surrey) in August 1727. His receiver-generalship went to his second cousin Denzil Onslow of Stoughton. Richard continued to represent the borough until his death. A steady supporter of Government, he made no particular figure in Parliamentary affairs. Onslow was commissioned colonel of the 39th Regiment of Foot in 1731. In 1734, he became accountant to his brother after the latter was appointed Treasurer of the Navy, holding the post until Arthur resigned the office in 1742. Richard transferred to become Colonel of the 8th (The King's) Regiment of Foot in 1739 (until 1745). He appointed Rev. Arthur Young, chaplain to his regiment. Young's son claimed that Onslow himself was not particularly religious, in part to escape the censure of his commander, the Duke of Cumberland. On 20 February 1741, he was promoted to brigadier general, and sent to Germany with the British contingent in the War of the Austrian Succession. He fought at the Battle of Dettingen on 27 June 1743, and was afterwards promoted to major general on 13 July. On 30 April 1745, Onslow succeeded Viscount Cobham as colonel and captain of the 1st Troop of Horse Grenadier Guards, while Edward Wolfe took over the King's Regiment. He and Henry Hawley commanded the second line of cavalry at the Battle of Fontenoy. He was one of the generals present in London in November after the British army in Flanders was recalled to suppress the Jacobite rising of 1745. Onslow's last promotion, to lieutenant general, occurred on 10 October 1747. On 15 February 1752, he was appointed Governor of Fort William, and in 1759, was removed to become Governor of Plymouth and military commander of the Western District. In early 1760, he was called upon to preside over the court- martial of Lord George Sackville for his conduct at the Battle of Minden, and concurrently of Lord Charles Hay for remarks made against Lord Loudoun, but died of a stroke on 16 March 1760 while presiding over the latter trial. In addition to his military career, he was a member of the original general court of the Society for Free British Fishery, founded in 1750.

Axbridge was one of the principal stations for the transport of strawberries, which led to the line's alternative name as The Strawberry Line. The station was opened with the broad gauge line to Cheddar in August 1869 as a two-platform station. The railway was extended to Wells in 1870, converted to standard gauge in the mid-1870s and then linked up to the East Somerset Railway to provide through services from Yatton to Witham in 1878. All the railways involved were absorbed into the Great Western Railway in the 1870s. This in turn was nationalised into the Western Region of British Railways on 1 January 1948. The site today The Yatton to Witham line closed to passengers and goods in 1963. Axbridge station buildings, which are of a substantial Bristol and Exeter Railway design in local Mendip stone, have been used since as a youth centre and are in a good state of preservation. But instead of fronting on to the railway, they are now on the Axbridge bypass road, which uses the line of the old railway.

A strongly minimal theory is a complete theory all models of which are minimal. A strongly minimal structure is a structure whose theory is strongly minimal. Thus a structure is minimal only if the parametrically definable subsets of its domain cannot be avoided, because they are already parametrically definable in the pure language of equality. Strong minimality was one of the early notions in the new field of classification theory and stability theory that was opened up by Morley's theorem on totally categorical structures. The nontrivial standard examples for strongly minimal theories are the one-sorted theories of infinite-dimensional vector spaces, and the theories ACFp of algebraically closed fields. As the example ACFp shows, the parametrically definable subsets of the square of the domain of a minimal structure can be relatively complicated (\\"curves\\"). More generally, a subset of a structure that is defined as the set of realizations of a formula œÜ(x) is called a minimal set if every parametrically definable subset of it is either finite or cofinite. It is called a strongly minimal set if this is true even in all elementary extensions. A strongly minimal set, equipped with the closure operator given by algebraic closure in the model-theoretic sense, is an infinite matroid, or pregeometry. A model of a strongly minimal theory is determined up to isomorphism by its dimension as a matroid. Totally categorical theories are controlled by a strongly minimal set; this fact explains (and is used in the proof of) Morley's theorem. Boris Zilber conjectured that the only pregeometries that can arise from strongly minimal sets are those that arise in vector spaces, projective spaces, or algebraically closed fields. This conjecture was refuted by Ehud Hrushovski, who developed a method known as the \\"Hrushovski construction\\" to build new strongly minimal structures from finite structures.

History It was built for Lord Thurlow, the owner of nearby Baynards Park, whose land was on the route of the proposed railway line. As a condition of sale, Lord Thurlow insisted on having a station built to serve his estate, despite there being no nearby settlement. The station was also used as the local post office in times when up to 30 horses and carts would queue outside on market days. Baynards railway station in 1961 Near the station was the Baynards Brick and Tile Works which was served by its own private siding. In early years it was a brickworks, producing Fuller's earth for the wool industry, and then foundry clay in later years. It then became a chemical processing works, receiving annually 400 tons of goods by rail (including sulphur from Italy via the Thames docks, tin from Swansea and packaging from Sittingbourne), whilst also sending out its own goods, from seed dressings to polishing compounds. The station closed in June 1965 when the Cranleigh Line was closed as part of the Beeching Axe.

The artistic set that introduced the Rococo style to England was centred on \\"Old Slaughter's\\" and the drawing-classes at the St. Martin's Lane Academy were inextricably linked in the dissemination of new artistic ideas in England in the reigns of George II and George III. History In Britain in the early eighteenth century there was no organised public official patronage of the arts, aside from commissions for specific projects. There was no established body to compare with the Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture that Jean-Baptiste Colbert had established in France, and no public exhibitions of recent paintings along the lines of the Paris salons, held every other year. The closest approximation to an academic life-drawing class was established in Great Queen Street in 1711 under twelve directors, with Sir Godfrey Kneller as its governor. George Vertue, a founder-member, describes it as \\"the Academy of Painting\\", although there is no evidence that any painting was ever done there. Sir James Thornhill took over from Kneller in 1718, but a few years later, after a period of infighting, he started a new academy, conducting life-drawing classes from a room he added to his own house in James Street, Covent Garden, from 1724William Sandby, The History of the Royal Academy of Arts from Its Foundation in 1768 (London: Longmans, Green) 1862:21. while a faction led by John Vanderbank and Louis Ch√©ron set up what they advertised as \\"The Academy for the Improvement of Painters and Sculptors by drawing from the Naked\\" at premises in St Martin's Lane. It proved popular, but failed after a few years when the subscriptions were embezzled by the treasurer. Thornhill continued his life-classes until his death in May 1734, but had little success in finding subscribers. Hogarth, (who was Thornhill's son-in-law) attributed its failure at least in part to the competition from Vanderbank and Cheron. It was Hogarth who established the St. Martin's Lane Academy in 1735, using the equipment from Thornhill's studio, and he remained its central figure. It is sometimes referred to as the \\"Second St Martin's Lane Academy\\", to differentiate it from that of Vanderbank and Ch√©ron. Hogarth wrote an account of its formation in about 1760,An excerpt is in Sandby:1862: in which he takes credit for the democratic principle that all should contribute an equal sum to the Academy's expenses and have an equal vote, \\"attributing the failure of the previous academies to the leading members having assumed a superiority which their fellow-students could not brook.\\" Thus the academy abandoned hierarchic seventeenth-century precedents and was formed on the basis of a club. The members of the academy took turns to \\"set\\" the model ‚Äì that is decide his or her pose ‚Äì rather than having this done by a paid director of the sort employed in French academies. Hogarth was opposed to copying from pictures, but there may have been casts to work from, inherited from Thornhill's studio. The premises of the Academy were a large room in Peter's Court, entered from St Martin's Lane through a low vaulted passageway.An engraving of it as it was in the mid nineteenth century was published in Sandby 1862:23. The membership of the academy was formed from an informal, club-like circle that was in the habit of meeting at Old Slaughter's Coffee House, which had been at 74 and 75, St. Martin's Lane since 1692, when the neighbourhood was still distinctly suburban.The building was demolished in 1843when Cranbourn Street was opened. (Survey of London 20 (1940:117 and pl. 120. It was known as\\"Old\\" Slaughter's Coffee House after 1742, when a new Slaughter's Coffee House opened, at no. 82 (more recently the site of Westminster County Court).Griffith 1983 note 28; Hogarth seems to have had some assistance in running the academy.George Vertue noted early in 1745 \\"The academy for the study of painting & other artists [sic] is carryd on and conducted by several, Ellis, Hayman, Gravelot, Wills‚Äî &c...;\\" Of these four named by Vertue, the most obscure is James Wills (working c. 1740‚Äì1777), later the Rev. James Wills. In 1754 he made a translation of du Fresnoy's stilted and old-fashioned Latin poem on the art of painting, De arte graphica, which did not meet a successful reception.Edwards 1808 found it \\"dry and literal\\". but which apparently identifies Wills as the \\"Fresnoy\\" who published bitterly sarcastic invective at Sir Joshua Reynolds and artists like Zoffany who had left the Society of Artists to join the newly founded Royal Academy.Whitley 1928:ii.272‚Äì79 makes the identification with Wills and prints some of the characteristically vituperative public letters of \\"Fresnoy\\". His conversation piece The Andrews Family (signed \\"J. Wills pinxit\\" and dated 1749) is in the collection of the Fitzwilliam Museum.Vertue Note-Books (The Walpole Society) 22 p 123. Edward Edwards' continuation of Walpole's Anecdotes of Painters (1808:55) notes that Wills had painted some portraits and historical subjects, \\"but not meeting much success in his profession he quit it, and having received a liberal education, took orders. He was for some years curate at Cannons, Middlesex, where the prominent cabinet-maker of St. Martin's Lane William Hallett had built a residence on part of the foundations of the great demolished house. In 1772 Wills was appointed to the living at Canons by Hallett's grandson, the subject, with his wife, of Gainsborough's The Morning Walk (1787).W.T. Whitley, Artists and Their Friends (1928), vol II:275; Ralph Edwards and Margaret Jourdain, Georgian Cabinet-Makers (London: Faber and Faber) 1955, s.v. \\"William Hallett\\"). Hogarth's involvement with the academy began to decline in 1753, following the circulation by its secretary, Francis Milner Newton, of a letter calling a meeting with the intention of electing 24 artists as professors of a putative public academy. Hogarth had long been opposed to the idea of such an institution. Newton's plans came to nothing, and the academy continued, under Francis Hayman and George Michael Moser. Moser moved the school to Pall Mall in 1767, and it closed four years later, when he became the first keeper of the Royal Academy. Membership Among the members of the St. Martin's Lane Academy were the engraver and book illustrator Hubert Gravelot; Fran√ßois Roubiliac, a French sculptor established in London; the painter Francis Hayman and his pupil, the very young Thomas Gainsborough who was employed by Gravelot; the Swiss-born artist and enameller George Michael Moser; the medallist Richard Yeo and the architect Isaac Ware. Desmond Fitz-Gerald notes that an asterisk in the list of subscribers to Joshua Kirby's, Dr Brook Taylor's Method of Perspective Made Easy (London 1754) identifies members of the St. Martin's Lane Academy, and notes as further members the architect James Paine; Charles, son of Henry Cheere, sculptor; and Johann Sebastian M√ºller, an engraver of Chippendale's Director.Fitz-Gerald, \\"Chipppendale's place in the English rococo\\", Furniture History 4 (1969:1‚Äì9); the full list from this source has not been published. An unexpected member of the circle was James Stuart, trained as a painter but familiar as one of the earliest practitioners of Neoclassicism in Europe; that later phase was far in the future when he moved in the Academy's milieu, introduced by the engravers Louis and Joseph Goupy, both of whom were members.Kerry Bristol, \\"A Newly-Discovered Drawing by James Stuart\\", Architectural History 44 Essays in Architectural History Presented to John Newman (2001:39‚Äì44) p. 42 and note; Bristol notes the connection from Stuart's obituary in The Gentleman's Magazine in 1788. The painters involved in the academy were reacting against the Italianate Late Baroque manner exemplified by Thornhill himself,Edward Croft-Murray, Decorative Painting in England, while the designers were developing alternatives to the cool Neo-Palladianism being espoused at the time by Lord Burlington and William Kent; the rococo artists found patrons, as Mark Girouard first noted, in the circle that formed around Frederick, Prince of Wales in Leicester Square. Old Slaughter's Coffee House Not all the artists in St. Martin's Lane were members of the Academy. Matthew Lock, the draughtsman and engraver who engraved most of the designs for Chippendale's Director, advertised in 1748 that he was offering evening drawing-classes for tradesmen and students in his premises \\"Facing Old Slaughter's Coffee House\\".Christopher Gilbert, The Life and Work of Thomas Chippendale (London/New York: Macmillan) 1966:7. and Thomas Chippendale, the most famous maker of English rococo furniture, seem never to have joined.Fitz- Gerald 1968 attempts to make a connection through connections to subscribers to The Director, but unsuccessfully, according to Gilbert 1968 and Geoffrey de Bellaigue, reviewing Gilbert in The Burlington Magazine 122 No. 927 (June 1980:441). Other French Protestant emigr√©s were drawn to the mix of English and foreigners at Slaughter's. Abraham de Moivre, friend of Newton and Halley, eked out a meagre existence as a tutor, spending evening hours at Slaughter's.He worked out his theory of the normal probability curve, which he published in the 1738 edition of the Doctrine of Chances; for Moivre and the abstract theory of the curve, see Helen M. Walker, \\"Bi-Centenary of the Normal Curve\\" Journal of the American Statistical Association 29 No. 185 (March 1934:72‚Äì75); Moivre noted at Slaughter's p 75. at the time chiefly interesting to gamblers seeking to maximise their odds rather than to statisticians. Other intellectuals were drawn to the atmosphere of Slaughter's: Joseph Priestley met in a virtual \\"Slaughter's Club\\" with Josiah Wedgwood, Captain Cook and Sir Joseph Banks.William P. Griffith, \\"Priestley in London\\" Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London 38.1 (August 1983:5. The presence of several outstanding cabinetmakers in St. Martin's Lane was influential in translating Rococo designs into furnishings. In December 1753, directly across from Old Slaughter's Thomas Chippendale took a long lease on three houses that served as his premises for the rest of his career.Gilbert 1966:9. A chance remark establishes that the cabinet-maker John Linnell attended life-classes at the St. Martin's Lane Academy,Desmond Fitz-Gerald, \\"Chipppendale's place in the English rococo\\", Furniture History 4 (1969:1‚Äì9). and William Hallett also had workshops in the Lane. In the 1760s Old Slaughter's Coffee House was the place where the Italian painter Antonio Zucchi, brought to London by Robert Adam, formed a friendship with the literary intellectual Jean-Paul Marat , \\"a man of extensive classical learning who continually proposed subjects which he had selected for Zucchi to design\\", the painter Joseph Farington noted in his diary, after Marat's subsequent revolutionary career had run its course;(Joseph Farington) James Greig, ed., The Farington Diary (London) 1922: vol I:24, entry for December 1803. Marat came to Zucchi's house \\"in the most familiar manner, a knife and fork laid for him every day.\\"Noted by Carol M. Osborne, \\"The Zucchi Sketchbook\\" The Huntington Library Quarterly 42.3 (Summer 1979:263‚Äì269) p. 268. At a later date it was \\"over a Neck of Veal and Potatoes, at the Old Slaughter Coffee House\\",David Williams (1738‚Äì1816), founder of the Royal Literary Fund recalled later (David Williams, \\"More Light on Franklin's Religious Ideas\\", The American Historical Review 43.4 [July 1938:803‚Äì813] p. 810.) The Honest Whigs are discussed by Verner W. Crane, \\"The Club of Honest Whigs: Friends of Science and Liberty\\" The William and Mary Quarterly 3rd Series 23.2 (April 1966:210‚Äì233). that the liberal scientific Club of Honest Whigs, centred on the figure of Benjamin Franklin was formed. The artistic circle meeting at Old Slaughter's Coffee House was revived from its obscurity in a series of articles by Mark Girouard.Girouard, \\"English art and the rococo, I‚ÄìIII: Coffee at Slaughter's; Hogarth and his friends; the two worlds of St Martin's Lane\\", Country Life 139 (13, 27 January and 3 February 1966), pp 58‚Äì61; 188‚Äì90; 224‚Äì27.

Early life Thompson was second son of Sir William Thompson (died 1695), serjeant-at-law, and his wife Mary Stephens of Bermondsey. He was educated at Brentwood Grammar School, Essex and was admitted at Trinity College, Cambridge on 25 April 1691, aged 14. He was awarded BA in 1695. In 1688, he was admitted a student at the Middle Temple, where he was called to the bar in 1698. He married by licence dated 16 July 1701, Mrs. Joyce Brent, a widow of St Clement Danes, Middlesex. He married as his second wife in on 7 November 1710, Julia Blackett, the widow of Sir William Blacket, Bt, of Newcastle-upon-Tyne and the daughter of Sir Christopher Conyers, Bt, of Horden, Durham. Career Thompson stood for Orford, Suffolk at the 1708 British general election on the recommendation of Sir Thomas Felton, 4th Baronet and though defeated in the poll with only three votes, was seated on petition as Member of Parliament for Orford on 29 January 1709. He voted for the naturalization of the Palatines, and was probably a teller on 7 March 1709 against a Tory amendment to the bill to prevent naturalized persons from standing or voting at parliamentary elections. He was put forward to sit on the committee to draw up the articles of impeachment against Dr Sacheverell on 14 December 1709, spoke on 11 January 1710 against the recommittal of the articles, and voted for the impeachment. He was involved in the prosecution of Sacheverell's riotous supporters, Daniel Dammaree, Francis Willis, and George Purchase over the period March to April 1710. At the 1710 British general election he stood at Ipswich but was unsuccessful. At the 1713 general election, he was returned as MP for Ipswich but was unseated by petition on 1 April 1714. Thompson regained the seat in the 1715 general election, and retained it until his elevation to the exchequer bench in November 1729. On 3 March 1715 Thompson was elected Recorder of London, and was knighted on 18 July 1715. He took part in the impeachment of the Jacobite George Seton, 5th Earl of Wintoun, 15‚Äì19 March 1716, Appointed for the solicitor-generalship, 24 January 1717, he was dismissed from that office, 17 March 1720, for bringing an unfounded charge of corrupt practices against attorney-general Nicholas Lechmere. Retaining the recordership, he was accorded in 1724 precedence in all courts after the solicitor-general. On 23 May 1726 he was appointed cursitor baron, and on 27 November 1729 he succeeded Sir Bernard Hale as puisne Baron of the Exchequer, having first been called to the degree of serjeant-at-law (17 November) This office with the recordership he retained until his death at Bath, 27 October 1739. In 1717 William Thomson introduced an act into the House of Commons that eventually became law in 1718 (4 Geo I, c.11). Known as the Transportation Act 1717 (a.k.a. Piracy Act), the Transportation Act formalized the process for transporting British criminals (except Scottish) to the American colonies. Seen as a way to reduce crime in Britain felons who committed clergyable offenses could be transported for 7 years and receivers of stolen goods could be transported for 14 years. This act of Thomson's resulted in tens of thousands of convicts being transported to the American colonies (including Canada and the West Indies) and later to Australia between 1718 and the end of transportation in 1867. Family Thompson died on 27 October 1739. He had no children by either wife.

It opened and operated for three years as the Weber and Fields' Music Hall. Its rooftop theatre, the Nora Bayes Theatre, presented many productions of the Federal Theatre Project in the mid 1930s. Its basement club became the famed Stage Door Canteen during World War II. History Connie Haines, Maxie Rosenbloom, Ben Lyon, Morton Downey and Joan Blondell at the Stage Door Canteen (1943) The 44th Street Theatre was located at 216 West 44th Street in New York City. The architect was William Albert Swasey. Built by The Shubert Organization in 1912, it was first named Weber and Fields' Music Hall. The theatre was renamed in 1915 when the comedy duo of Joe Weber and Lew Fields split with the Shuberts. A theatre on the roof of the building, Lew Fields' 44th Street Roof Garden, became the Nora Bayes Theatre in 1918. In the mid-1930s it presented Federal Theatre Project shows. In the basement of the 44th Street Theatre was a small nightclub,Club Alabam during Prohibition. In 1940 the building was purchased by The New York Times Company, which leased it back to Lee Shubert. When the American Theatre Wing requested the basement club as an entertainment venue for servicemen, Shubert gave them the property without charge. In March 1942 the 40-by-80-foot club space became the original Stage Door Canteen, which operated throughout World War II, became the subject of a popular film, and inspired other canteens throughout the United States.

It is developed by The Halcyon Company's gaming subsidiary, Halcyon Games, along with Grin and published by Equity Games and Evolved Games. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, mobile and iOS. Set in 2016 in Los Angeles, the console and PC versions of the game take place between the events of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines and Terminator Salvation and follow John Connor (Gideon Emery), and his team, consisting of Angie Salter (Rose McGowan), Barnes (Common) and Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood). However, Christian Bale refused to lend his voice and likeness for the game. Rose McGowan voiced the game-exclusive character Angie Salter, who is an ex-high school teacher. Common and Moon Bloodgood voiced their own characters from the film (Barnes and Blair, respectively). An animated web series, Terminator Salvation: The Machinima Series, takes place before the game, and was released by Machinima on May 18, 2009. Terminator: Resistance was released in 2019, and disregards both film and the game. Gameplay Terminator Salvation is a third-person shooter where the player needs to \\"constantly move, flank, cover and utilize their squad to progress.\\" The player must battle Skynet enemies from the film of the same name as well as new enemies specifically designed for the game. The game features a campaign that can be played alone or cooperatively with one other local player via split-screen. The co-op version of the game enables players to play as both John Connor and his teammate Blair Williams. The game employs a cover and movement system not unlike those featured in Gears of War and Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway, wherein the player can quickly choose to dodge between different forms of cover, coming out only to fire shots at enemies. Staying in cover is advantageous, as the player only regenerates health when they have not received damage for a certain amount of time (as in the Halo and Call of Duty games). Although players initially are only equipped with an M4 carbine, other weapons such as the RPG-7 and M79 grenade launcher, Remington 870 shotgun, and M249 SAW as well as various types of grenades (Flash and fragmentation) are acquired throughout the game. Enemy A.I. is relatively strong, both keeping track of the player's location realistically (that is, not omniscient but using sight and sound to locate the player) as well as actively pursuing and flanking them when cover is sought by the player. Plot Console & Windows version Twelve years after Judgment Day, John Connor reflects on the old days of preparing for the future battle. Returning to an evac point with Blair Williams and other soldiers, they battle their way through machines to discover that there are no helicopters waiting for them. Escaping in trucks instead, the group is attacked by a Hunter-Killer aircraft. After John Connor manages to destroy the H-K, a T-600 appears and kills several members of his team. The team travels underground, then above again, battling machines. The surviving trio manages to reach the evacuation point, meeting soldiers. Aerostat drones attack, and John, Blair and others go outside to take care of them. One is killed in the battle. A Resistance team led by soldier David Weston (Sean Cory Cooper) asks for help, but his transmission is lost. The team then tries to make a landing place for a helicopter. The chopper lands and rescues the team, but John and Blair stay behind to rescue David's team. The duo goes into the sewers. A rescue team, Epsilon, has a helicopter going down, so the duo goes to its crash-site to check for survivors. They rescue four soldiers, Angie (Rose McGowan), an unknown, Deckard (Joe Camareno) and Dobkin (Nolan North). They fight a legion of machines and then, afterwards, decide to head for an old Resistance outpost. Deckard and the unknown are killed by a T-600, and the team is forced to retreat. They manage to destroy two T-600s. They have no choice but to retreat, but with no way out, the team is forced to destroy the T-600s, though Dobkin is mortally wounded in the fight. The three continue to go to Skynet while defending themselves. They decide to go to a tower so they can observe Skynet patrols so as to plan a route to rescue David. They encounter T-600s with rubber skin, which the trio destroy. John warns the other two about the T-800, which has real, vat-grown skin. They reach the tower, where they encounter a Hunter-Killer, but John, Blair and Angie manage to destroy it. There are too many machines on a nearby street that they planned to go down, so the three decide to go to Union Station at the subway, following the tracks to Skynet. They traverse their way to a hidden survivalist camp. The survivalists don't trust them at first (because of the T-600s with rubber skin), but they manage to gain their trust. They say they have not encountered Skynet for a long time. The leader, named Warren Campbell (Ed O' Ross), leads him to Barnes (Common), who will supply them. Machines come, and John, Blair and Barnes fight off the machines while Warren and Angie evacuate the area. Barnes reveals to John that machines actually come every two months. They destroy the machines with detonators, and everybody evacuates by train. John and Blair defend the train by missile launcher. They stop to rescue other people from machines and succeed. They escape, but the train derails, so they go on foot to a truck depot, meeting up with other soldiers. Warren drives a school bus, while John and Blair defend it, eventually saving the bus. They go their separate ways, but Warren says they can visit them anytime. Warren still has doubts of their plan, saying that they can't communicate as long as a Skynet communications tower still stands. Barnes joins the three, saying he's tired of running and wishes to join the Resistance. Battling numerous machines to infiltrate the Skynet compound, an alarm is accidentally triggered when Connor steals important documents. While Barnes sets up explosives, John, Blair and Angie old off T-600s and T-7-T's. While the explosives go off, they run into the elevator to escape. However, with the control panel located outside, Angie sacrifices herself so that John and the others can return to the surface. John is racked with guilt, but Blair explains that he had helped Angie fight, and she believed he could help humanity win. Later, John is fixing what appears to be a vehicle. He calls his base (answered by teammate Linda (Lupe)), saying he needs airpower to rescue David's team. Linda says it is going to be a problem, because of a harvester. \\"That won't be a problem\\", John says, because he reprogrammed a Hunter-Killer tank, and programmed it to go straight to Skynet. He does not have control of the guns, though. That quickly changes when Warren's team returns, with the access codes to the guns and Warren apologizes. They first have to locate and destroy Skynet's anti- aircraft turrets. They destroy four areas of turrets and machines, but the tank takes too much damage. John suggests that they could deactivate them on foot. John, Blair and Barnes are joined by three men to deactivate the turrets and to find David's men. Warren and the others cover John by destroying as many machines as possible. They traverse Skynet and destroy all machines that they encounter, until they find Weston and his men. Warren's men agree to escort them to the vehicles, while John, Blair, David and Barnes go through the service tunnels to deactivate the turrets. The four try to make it to the control room. John shuts down the machines for a few minutes, enough time to get them out of Skynet. The four attempt to escape Skynet before they destroy the base. With the four of them safe, they all return to their Resistance camp. Connor narrates, saying that he has gained faith by what he is about to create in the future, instead of the past. iOS version The game takes place in the year 2018. John Connor arrives via a helicopter in Los Angeles to assist a squad of resistance fighters. The captain of the squad tells him to reach a bunker. Upon reaching the bunker, he is informed that some of the Resistance fighters got trapped in it and is tasked with rescuing them. After John rescues the fighters, the captain informs him that the bunker is going to explode. John is successfully able to escape from the bunker. A team of resistance fighters carrying a special transmitter in the city was given a mission to call airstrikes on a Hunter-Killer tank to destroy it and recover its remains for research. However the team got attacked and was scattered. It fell upon John to recover the transmitter and complete the mission. While recovering the transmitter parts, he encounters the H-K tank. He is given the last transmitter part by a member of the team who tells him to find a way around the H-K tank through a nearby house in order to call upon an airstrike on it. John is successful in calling an airstrike on the H-K tank and it is destroyed. The game then shifts to Marcus Wright who awakens among the ruins of Los Angeles but has no idea where he is. He befriends a young Kyle Reese. They both decide to escape the city and join the Resistance. Marcus goes to the hills where he hopes to find a working car. Marcus is attacked by a Hunter-Killer aircraft in a parking lot although he is able to destroy it. Marcus is able to find a vehicle and along with Kyle tries to escape out of the city in it. While driving, they spot a Harvester near them. They try to avoid being detected by him while driving but it's able to discover them and chases after them. However they are able to take it down and escape the city. The game then shifts back to John. The intel gathered from the destroyed H-K tank showed the location of Skynet's base and John decides to enter it alone. The way to the base is guarded by a H-K tank which he is able to destroy. He rides to the base using a Moto-Terminator taken down by the Resistance. In the base he encounters a T-700 which he destroys. The base defences catch John by surprise and injure him, but he manages to escape and blow up the complex. The game with John seeing the complex destroy inside the pupil of his eye. Development The game was announced on November 15, 2007, when the Halcyon Company also announced the formation of Halcyon Games, the video game arm of the studio. It had been in development for several months at Grin and Halcyon Games, before filming took place. Peter Levin, a former Disney executive, headed up Halcyon Games as acting CEO. The CEO revealed that Halcyon decided to develop the game internally rather than contract another studio to create the game. Although a multiplayer mode was originally planned it was decidedly dropped to allow the game to be released on schedule. With Halcyon developments' VP Cos Lazouras stating \\"It is my opinion to do less better, than more but mediocre. We did get local co-op in which is incredibly cool.\\" Reception Terminator Salvation received mixed reviews from critics. Acclaim depended on the platform the game was on. GameRankings gave the iOS version a score of 83%, and Metacritic gave the game 48 out of 100 for the Xbox 360 version, 43 out of 100 for the PlayStation 3 version, and 49 out of 100 for the PC version. GameSpot reviewer Chris Watters rated it a 5 out of 10, citing the repetitive combat, mediocre visuals, short length, and that the lead actor of the film, Christian Bale, did not do the voice acting for the game's John Connor. Hilary Goldstein of IGN gave all console versions except the iOS version a 6.3 out 10 for its passable visuals, good ally A.I., and complete lack of replay value. He also criticized it because Bale's voice was missing. In the video review, IGN did not like Bale not voicing or the short game, but liked the enemy A.I. and the cover system.

Remains comprise 44 molars, found in the north of the island, seven molars discovered in the south-east, a single measurable femur and a single tusk among very sparse additional bone and tusk fragments. The molars support derivation from the Straight-tusked elephant (Palaeoloxodon antiquus), that inhabited Europe since 780,000 years ago. The species is presumably derived from the older, larger P. xylophagou from the late Middle Pleistocene who reached the island presumably during a Pleistocene glacial maximum when low sea levels allowed a low probability sea crossing between Cyprus and Asia Minor, most likely between the Karpas peninsula and Adana Province. During subsequent periods of isolation the population adapted within the evolutionary mechanisms of insular dwarfism, which the available sequence of molar fossils confirms to a certain extent. The fully developed Palaeoloxodon cypriotes weighed not more than and had a maximum height of . Whether the species extinction is to be attributed to the arrival of humans on the island remains debated. The species represented a sizable food source, but was easily overcome by contemporary hunter-gatherer populations. An association of dwarf elephant bones with human artefacts is found at the ~13,000 to 11,000 year old Aetokremnos site on the southern coast of the island.  Features  Molar comparison supports the notion that the species descended from the straight- tusked elephant, this much smaller species inhabited Cyprus and some other Mediterranean islands after the Messinian salinity crisis, during the Late Pleistocene. Its estimated body weight was only some 200 kilogrammes, a weight reduction of 98% from its ancestors which weighed about 10 tonnes. Their molars however were about 40% of the size of the mainland straight-tusked elephants. The factors responsible for the dwarfing of island mammals are thought to include the reduction in available food, predation and competition. The Cyprus dwarf elephant roamed the world at least until 11,000 BC.  Excavations  Tusk of a young P. cypriotes Remains of the first Cyprus Dwarf Elephant were discovered and documented by Dorothea Bate in 1902. She found the fossilized bones of the elephant in a cave in the Kyrenia hills of Cyprus. The species is also known under its synonym Elephas cypriotes.Reese, David S.: Men, Saints, or Dragons? in Folklore, Vol. 87, No. 1 (1976), pp. 89‚Äì95 Finds of whole or partial skeletons of this elephant are very rare. The first recorded find was by Dorothea Bate in a cave in the Kyrenia hills of Cyprus in 1902, described in a paper for the Royal Society in 1903Bate, D. M. A.: \\"Preliminary Note on the Discovery of a Pygmy Elephant in the Pleistocene of Cyprus\\" in Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Vol. 71 (1902‚Äì1903), pp. 498‚Äì500 and in a later paper for Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London in 1905.\\"Further Note on the Remains of Elephas cypriotes from a Cave-Deposit in Cyprus\\" by Dorothea M. A. Bate in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, Series B, Containing Papers of a Biological Character, Vol. 197 (1905), pp. 347‚Äì360 Human interference leading to the extinction to the Cyprus dwarf elephant has been a controversial topic over the last decade. A rising theory is that most of the elephants became deceased during the settlement of the Mediterranean islands. A claim to support this theory is that the early Greek settlers thousands of years later incorporated the dwarf elephant into their mythology calling them Cyclopes (one-eyed monsters). This is because the skull of an elephant shows a single large hole on the forehead which does resemble an eye socket - the actual eye sockets are placed quite low on the sides of the animal's head and thus easily overlooked.

The Day for Darfur was originally conceived by a group of NGOs working on Darfur concerned about the slow response of the international community to the crisis. Key participating organisations include Aegis Trust, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, International Crisis Group, and Save Darfur Coalition. There have been four Days for Darfur called since the first took place on September 17, 2006, each focusing on a call to governments and international bodies.  First Day for Darfur  On September 17, 2006 the Globe for Darfur coalition marked the first anniversary of the signing of the 2005 UN World Summit Outcome Document by holding the first Global Day for Darfur. More than 60 events in 42 cities were held, calling for UN peacekeepers to be deployed to the Darfur region of Sudan to support the chronically understaffed African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) force.  Second Day for Darfur  December 10, 2006 raised the issue of rape and sexual violence in Darfur and called on world leaders to work with the African Union and its member states to make protecting women from rape a priority for AMIS, including an increase in the number of female AMIS police officers and translators in Darfur and extension of firewood patrols around all internally displaced people (IDP) camps. Further calls were made towards the Government of Sudan, to allow humanitarian organisations to have free and unfettered access to help victims of rape and other forms of sexual violence and to hold perpetrators of rape and sexual assault accountable for their crimes. A number of leading stateswomen released an open letter on the day, calling for the immediate deployment of a robust international peacekeeping force to protect Darfuri women and children. Signatories included: Madeleine Albright, Gra√ßa Machel, Mary Robinson, Carol Bellamy, Hanan Ashrawi, Glenys Kinnock, √âdith Cresson, Sigrid Rausing, Professor Fatima Babiker Mahmoud, Wendy Ruth Sherman, Professor Dr. Herta D√§ubler-Gmelin, Nicole Fontaine, Agnes Nyoka Peter, Yakin Erturk, Emma Bonino, and Hina Jilani.  Third Day for Darfur  On April 29, 2007 the Globe for Darfur coalition marked the fourth anniversary of the Darfur crisis with events taking place in more than 200 cities calling on the UN Secretary-General to demand that governments pressure all sides to stop the violence, respect the ceasefire and end opposition to the hybrid force. Activists were joined by a number of high-profile figures who called on the international community to protect the civilians of Darfur, including: George Clooney, Hugh Grant, Bob Geldof, Don Cheadle, Sir Elton John, David Furnish, Sir Mick Jagger, Mark Knopfler, Thandie Newton, Emmanuel Jal, Mia Farrow, Mariella Frostrup, and Alex James.  Fourth Day for Darfur  September 16, 2007 was held in anticipation of the opening of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, calling on the UN General Assembly to keep the Darfur crisis in the spotlight and ensure the full and expeditious deployment of the UNAMID peacekeeping force. Prior to the Day for Darfur events, a group of high-profile women visited Darfuri IDPs in camps across the border in Chad and a number of women called on world leaders to step up pressure on all parties in the conflict to agree to an immediate ceasefire. This group included Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Asha Haji Elmi, Maria Barroso, Cate Blanchett, Herta D√§ubler-Gmelin, Binet Diop, Mia Farrow, Mariella Frostrup, Ana Gomes, Germaine Greer, Isabel Jonet, Musimbi Kanyoro, Ang√©lique Kidjo, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Kerry Kennedy, Manuela Ferreira Leite, Elle Macpherson, Rosa Mota, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Eva Padberg, Sigrid Rausing, Mary Robinson, Dame Anita Roddick, Deborah Scroggins, and Jane Wales.

He is best known for his time with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling/Impact Wrestling under the ring names DJZ and Zema Ion. He is currently signed to WWE, where he performs on the NXT brand under the ring name Joaquin Wilde. In TNA/Impact Wrestling he is a former two-time X Division Champion and one-time World Tag Team Champion with Andrew Everett. He has also worked for various other promotions, such as Major League Wrestling, Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide and DDT Pro-Wrestling. Professional wrestling career Early career (2003‚Äì2004) In 2003, Paris began training to become a professional wrestler at the Coalition of Competition in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania under trainers Super Hentai, Shirley Doe, and Glenn Spectre. He trained there for 14 months before debuting as Shiima Xion, the \\"first Filipino male model of wrestling\\" on August 21, 2004, against Jason Gory in Wheeling, West Virginia for Black Diamond Wrestling. Shiima Xion competed throughout West Virginia and Ohio in late 2004, since he was not old enough to compete in the state of Pennsylvania. Shortly after turning 18, however, Xion began competing regularly for the International Wrestling Cartel, as well as making appearances in Chikara, Far North Wrestling, and Pro Wrestling Unplugged. By early 2006, the Shiima Xion character had become more of a glam rock star than a male model, as Xion began wearing make-up to the ring, and had also changed his hair color from black to red/blonde. His bizarre hair style soon became his trademark, with Shiima becoming best known for hairspraying his hair during matches. The androgynous character eventually caught the attention of Japanese wrestling promoter Sanshiro Takagi, who invited 19-year-old Shiima to tour Japan with his company, Dramatic Dream Team (DDT) in the summer of 2006. Shiima Xion was featured in the Introducing ... article in Pro Wrestling Illustrated's The Wrestler, volume 19, 2007. The magazine was released on newsstands nationwide on December 4, 2007, with a two-page article spread on Shiima. Independent circuit (2004‚Äì2019) Shiima Xion made his IWC debut on November 6, 2004 in Munhall, Pennsylvania, shortly after his eighteenth birthday. Shiima lost to Jason Gory, who was also making his IWC debut that night. The two feuded into 2005, culminating at IWC No Excuses on July 29, 2005, where Gory came out victorious. Next month, Shiima would receive a shot at Shirley Doe's IWC World Heavyweight Championship and lost. For the next few months he would team with Chris Maverick as the International Males which ended with an IWC Tag Team Champions, Gambino Brothers Moving Company, and lost. Shiima would once again come across Gory at IWC Super Indy V on April 15, 2006, in which Shiima defeated Gory with the Filipino Destroyer. Post-match saw the two shake hands for the first time in their near two-year-long rivalry and eventually led to them forming a tag team known as Team Catfish and eventually Babyface Fire (BFF). BFF teamed for the first time on July 7, 2006, and were defeated by Chris Hero and Claudio Castagnoli.

Paris is a journalism major at West Virginia University. Paris was featured in the documentary Slammed: Inside Indie Wrestling. Paris says he has started suffering medical issues and wrestling-related injuries since turning 30. The first of these was in September, 2016, when he broke his wrist in a match he wrestled for free in Chicago, Illinois which required a permanent screw to be implanted to fix. In May 2013, he started a GiveForward campaign to raise money to help pay to remove a benign tumor in his bladder, which had been discovered during an emergency appendectomy. On April 5, 2017, Paris suffered a second \\"colon-related health scare\\" after a 450¬∞ splash from Laredo Kid during a match for The Crash promotion in Mexico City caused a ruptured colon and internal bleeding, forcing him into emergency surgery. Doctors gave him a 20% chance of having use a colostomy bag for the rest of his life. The surgery was successful and he returned to the ring two months later at an International Wrestling Cartel show, losing to Adam Cole. This injury resulted in thousands of dollars of debt related to hospital bills and an estimated $10,000 in lost revenue from missed bookings.

The modern diocese was created in 1853.Diocese Profile, Catholic-Hierarchy.org; accessed 8 April 2018. It is a suffragan of the archdiocese of Utrecht. It is currently led by bishop Gerard de Korte. Its see is St John's Cathedral, 's-Hertogenbosch. History The city of 's-Hertogenbosch (Hertzogenbusch, Sylva Ducis) was founded in 1184, but with the surrounding territory, was included in the Diocese of Li√®ge until 12 March 1561. At that time, to check the spread of Protestantism, Pope Pius IV raised it to the dignity of a see, and made it suffragan to the archdiocese of Mechelen. The first bishop was the theologian Francis Sonnius (1562‚Äì69), afterwards transferred to the see of Antwerp. His successors suffered in the political disorders and wars of the last quarter of the 16th-century. When after a long siege the city was captured by Prince Frederick Henry (14 September 1629) and held in the name of the States-General, the sixth bishop, Michael Ophovius, was obliged to abandon his see, which he did in a solemn procession, surrounded by his clergy, and bearing with him a famous miraculous statue of the Blessed Virgin which he placed in safety at Brussels. Joseph de Bergaigne (1638‚Äì47) was little more than bishop in name. He was unable to assert his right to the see, and exercised his functions as best he could from Geldrop. By the Treaty of Westphalia (1648) the entire territory of the diocese was recognized as a permanent conquest of the Dutch Republic, and made directly subject to the jurisdiction of the States General. The exercise of the Catholic religion was forbidden by law, and the pertinent decrees were applied with rigour. Roman Catholic priests, however, continued their ministry in secret. The diocese became a simple mission, governed by a Vicar Apostolic who was usually a titular bishop. The diocese of 's-Hertogenbosch was administered in this fashion until 1853. In 1810 Napoleon had tried to create another diocese under that name, inclusive of the territory known as the Bouches du Rhin, and obtained a titular for the new see in the person of the imperial courtier, Monsignor Van Camp. A similar failure awaited the attempt, authorized by the Concordat of 27 August 1827, to divide all of the Netherlands into two large dioceses, Amsterdam and 's-Hertogenbosch. The ancient see was finally revived by Pope Pius IX on the occasion of the restoration of the hierarchy in the Netherlands, where, since 1848, the revised constitution has assured Catholics full political and religious liberty. Together with three other Dutch sees, 's-Hertogenbosch was re- established by the pontifical Breve of 4 March 1853, and with its former limits; all four sees were made suffragan to Utrecht. Jan Zwijsen, a native of the diocese and its most illustrious son, hitherto vicar-Apostolic, was the first bishop of the re-established see, though temporarily he was known as administrator-Apostolic, since he was already Archbishop of Utrecht, with which office he was to unite the government of 's-Hertogenbosch. In 1865, the first provincial synod was held there. In 1868 he resigned the archiepiscopal See of Utrecht, but continued the administration of 's-Hertogenbosch. He was succeeded by Adrianus Godschalk, who died in 1892, leaving the see to be filled by Bishop William van den Ven. The above-mentioned miraculous statue of the Blessed Virgin was restored to the cathedral. During the 1960s, the relatively strong demarcation between the Catholic south on one side and the Calvinist west and north on the other side of the Netherlands started to diminish. In the second half of the 20th-century a rapid rise of secularization and strong loss of religious affiliation took place in North Brabant. In 2006, slightly more than half of the Brabantian people identified with Catholicism. In the Diocese of 's-Hertogenbosch, the eastern part of North Brabant and part of the province of Gelderland, 1,167,000 people felt associated with the Roman Catholic belief system (56.8 percent of the population). Only 45,645 residents of this area attend the mass, which is only 2 percent of the total population of the area and consists mostly of people over 65 years old.Kerncijfers 2006 uit de kerkelijke statistiek van het Rooms- Katholiek Kerkgenootschap in Nederland, Rapport nr. 561 oktober 2007, Jolanda Massaar- Remmerswaal dr. Ton Bernts, KASKI, onderzoek en advies over religie en samenleving North Brabant is mostly Roman Catholic by tradition and still uses the term and certain traditions as a base for its cultural identity, though the vast majority of the population is now largely irreligious in practice. Research among Dutch Roman Catholics in 2006 shows that only 27% of Dutch Catholics can be regarded as theist, 55% as ietsist/agnostic theist and 17% as agnostic.God in Nederland (1996-2006), by Ronald Meester, G.

(1989). The glyoxalase system. In Glutathione: Chemical, Biochemical and Medical Aspects. Part A, D. Dolphin, R. Poulson, and O. Avramovic, eds. (New York: John Wiley & Sons), pp. 597-641. This system has been studied in both bacteria and eukaryotes. This detoxification is accomplished by the sequential action of two thiol-dependent enzymes; firstly glyoxalase –Ü, which catalyses the isomerisation of the spontaneously formed hemithioacetal adduct between GSH and 2-oxoaldehydes (such as methylglyoxal) into S-2-hydroxyacylglutathione. Secondly, glyoxalase –Ü–Ü hydrolyses these thiolesters and in the case of methylglyoxal catabolism, produces D-lactate and GSH from S-D-lactoyl-glutathione. This system shows many of the typical features of the enzymes that dispose of endogenous toxins. Firstly, in contrast to the amazing substrate range of many of the enzymes involved in xenobiotic metabolism, it shows a narrow substrate specificity. Secondly, intracellular thiols are required as part of its enzymatic mechanism and thirdly, the system acts to recycle reactive metabolites back to a form which may be useful to cellular metabolism.

Childhood and youth Son of W. Antonio Galeano and Ana Mieres, his real name was Felix, after his grandfather on his father side, and Roberto, after his grandfather, on his mother side. He was two years when the cruel civil war of \`47 started. He always remember his father, was on his way to prison for defending his principles and ideals, on the harbor of Puerto Pinasco, waving his handkerchief, blond and happy. In this time he was given his first guitar, a toy one, and he enjoyed singing songs he imagined himself with it. At the beginning of 1948, his family decides to move to Asuncion. He begins his studies at the Colegio San Jose, an educational institution to which he was to be linked during all his life. He was a lively and nonconformist teenager, and also studied at the Liceo Militar Acosta √ëu as well as in the Colegio Carlos Antonio Lopez. He finished his high school in the Colegio Lasalle, in Buenos Aires, with honors. In 1962, with his father in the diplomatic service, the family moves to the Argentine capital. There he joined with other Paraguayans fellow musicians and forms a band where he sings and plays the guitar. When he returns to his country, he begins the university but he doesn't finish his studies. He begins to compose. In the middle of the 1960s he shows some of his first works, very elemental but with purity. First steps His friend and teacher at journalism, Fernando Cazenave, invites him to be a part of the crew at the Diario ABC Color newspaper when it is opened, in 1967. He then begins the career as a social communicator, a condition he would carry with pride until his death, as a collaborator of La Tribuna and El Diario Hoy, where he was the chief of the sports section as well as the secretary of editorial staff. Another great passion of his, besides his obvious love for music, was the love for teaching. Since 1974 until 1978 he taught music at his old school, San Jose. On April 19, 1969, he married Maria Cristina Barrail Pecci. He had four daughters: Sandra Maria, Viviana Guadalupe,Ana Karina and Maria Alegria. Works At the end of the \`60 he composes songs to accompany carnival groups (comparsas) at the Centenario Club. These ‚Äúcomparsas‚Äù were also directed by him. From these years, specifically from 1969 to 1970 are his first satirical songs. ‚ÄúLos problemas que acarrea un televisor en la casa de un hombre como yo‚Äù, ‚ÄúLa chuchi‚Äù y ‚ÄúTom√°s te canasta‚Äù find an immediate eco in the public. With them he begins to shape his own profile, the unique Maneco Galeano of the Paraguayan popular compositions. At the end of 1970, when all the young composers and players find their meeting point at ‚ÄúLa Guarida del Matrero‚Äù, managed by Santi Medina, he participated on a television show with Christmas themes, where he presented ‚ÄúDos trocitos de Madera‚Äù, historically his first ‚Äúserious‚Äú piece. In 1971 ‚ÄúSoy de la Chacarita‚Äù is written. His first appearance is at a beneficial festival on behalf of the people who suffered the great flood of the Rio Paraguay, who left many families by the river homeless. He founded the ‚Äú Joven Alianza‚Äù with other friends such as Carlos Noguera, Mito Sequera, Juan Manuel Marcos and Jose Antonio Galeano. This was an intent of creative and artist cooperative which was later to be destroyed by the political police of the dictatorship of then President Alfredo Stroessner. By then, the creative activity didn‚Äôt stop. Between 1972 and 1976 his best pieces come to life. From this period are ‚ÄúDespertar‚Äù, ‚ÄúSan si Juan no que s√≠‚Äù, ‚ÄúPara un rostro labrador‚Äù, ‚ÄúPinasco‚Äù, ‚ÄúJos√© Tromb√≥n‚Äù, ‚ÄúPara decir‚Äù, ‚ÄúDon Jos√© de todas partes‚Äù, among the more significant ones. He also writes the lyrics for ‚ÄúCeferino Zarza, compa√±ero‚Äù (music of Jorge Garbett) and ‚ÄúCantando‚Äù (music by Jorge Krauch). With Carlos Noguera he composes the only piece that was written by the most important names of the Nueva Cancion Paraguaya, ‚ÄúAl ca√≠do en la v√≠spera‚Äù, a homage to the Chilean composer and singer Victor Jara, who was brutally murdered in the military takeover (military coup) of 1973 in his country. The piece later will be popular with the name of ‚ÄúVictor Libre‚Äú. We must mention specially his participation in the composition of part of the music of Lopez, a work of Juan Manuel Marcos mixing texts, songs and poetry, about the Paraguayan War. It was presented by the Grupo Experimental de Teatro ‚ÄúAnguekoi ‚Äúwith great success in 1973.The songs composed by Maneco are ‚Äú¬°Independencia o Muerte! ‚Äù, ‚ÄúCanto a Felipe Varela‚Äù (both on poems by Marcos) and ‚ÄúResurgir√°s, Paraguay‚Äù, on the ode of Martin McMahon dedicated to our country. Also in 1973, he joins the Quinteto Vocal de la Facultad de Derecho UNA, to participate at the university festival of the song. The group, that later will be the Grupo Sembrador, wins the first award to the composition playing ‚ÄúSan Juan si Juan no que s√≠‚Äù. In 1975, on one of the very rare occasions Augusto Roa Bastos visited our country, when he was still allowed to do so, Sembrador offers a recital homage to the great writer, presenting for the first time almost sixteen songs of the Nuevo Cancionero Paraguayo. We can mention among them, ‚ÄúDonde la guarania crece‚Äù, composed by Maneco on a beautiful texto of Roa. From ‚Äò75 al ‚Äò76, he composes for his dear friend Jorge Garbett -whom he had met in 1974-some lyrics of deep meaning: ‚ÄúElla es as√≠‚Äù, ‚ÄúSe le quiere‚Äù y ‚ÄúLluvia‚Äù. Between 1976 and 1977 he studies music with the masters Carlos Dos Santos and Luis Ca√±ete. He composes ‚ÄúCigarra, tonta cigarra‚Äù, on the text of Jos√©-Luis Appleyard, ‚ÄúNda reiri oje‚Äôe‚Äù, on a poem of Rudi Torga and ‚ÄúKa‚Äôakupe piari‚Äù, a strong polka whose lyrics are the only one totally written in Guarani language by Maneco. After his experience with Taller Musical Sembrador, he stops writing songs and he dedicates passionately to his work as a journalist. From that time of ‚Äúmusical silence‚Äù-like he always used to call it- are the ‚Äú Cuentos ‚Äúpublished in the great ‚ÄúDominical Hoy‚Äù. He becomes skeptical and, he considers then that the songs are useless to help change a state of things that unfortunately were lasting too many decades. Last years Only by 1980, when the sickness which was to kill him was already declared, he goes back to creation when he finds out about the Primer Festival Ypacarai of the Musical Composition. He makes his last piece, ‚ÄùPoncho de sesenta listas‚Äù, which won the second prize in that contest. He left behind a fruitful musical production-numerous and large- as well as important journalistic writings and an unforgettable memory in his former students and his many friends. Maneco Galeano died in Asuncion, on a Tuesday, December 9, 1980, at 3:45 pm, from lung cancer. He was 35 years old.

However, it had effectively existed since August 1944, when communists began to infiltrate the Ministry of Internal Affairs on a large scale, with help from SMERSH, an NKVD unit charged with demolishing existing intelligence agencies and replacing them with Soviet-style bodies in the Soviet-occupied countries of Eastern Europe. From its inception, the Securitate engaged in a terror campaign against \\"class enemies\\". The campaign was led from the position of Minister of Interior by Teohari Georgescu in 1948‚Äì1952, and Alexandru DrƒÉghici in 1952‚Äì1965, seconded in the position of Deputy Interior Minister (until 1960) and Chief of Securitate by Gheorghe Pintilie.

She was a friend of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who wrote a few works for her to sing. Her name is most often given in its German version as above. In Czech her name was Josef√≠na Du≈°kov√° or (with Germanized spelling) Josepha Duschkova. Life  She was born Josepha Hambacher in Prague, then a provincial capital of the Austrian Empire, on 6 March 1754, and lived in Prague all of her life. Her father was a prosperous apothecary, Anton Adalbert Hambacher (also \\"Hampacher\\") and her mother was Maria Domenica Colomba, who came from Salzburg. Her father‚Äôs pharmacy was in the house called \\"Zum weissen Einhorn\\" (\\"The White Unicorn\\"). Built in the Baroque style, it was situated in the Old Town Square where the pharmaceutical business flourished until the 20th century. In her youth Josepha studied music with Franti≈°ek Xaver Du≈°ek, whom she married on 21 October 1776. Josefa‚Äôs husband already had an international reputation as a music teacher. He was a welcome guest in the music salons and he and his wife became well-known hosts at their home, Villa Bertramka. It is not known whether the couple performed together as musicians, but they hosted frequent musical gatherings at which many famous people were present. Josepha had earlier been the lover of the art patron Count Christian Philipp Clam- Gallas, and it was said that she continued to profit long afterwards from the relationship as the Count provided her with an annuity of 900 Gulden and even contributed to the purchase of the Villa Bertramka.Duschek's relationship with Count Clam-Gallas is detailed in Freeman, Mozart in Prague, 118-19. Her career as a singer was long and successful; she gave concerts in many different cities, including Prague, Vienna, Salzburg, Dresden, Weimar, Leipzig, Warsaw and Berlin. The singer and her husband were also close with the composer Ludwig van Beethoven. While Beethoven was in Prague in 1796, he wrote his concert aria ', Op. 65, for this talented singer. She was not able to sing the piece at its debut because of a conflicting engagement, but she did perform the piece in both Prague and later in Leipzig. The debut was performed by the Countess Josephine Clary, to whom Beethoven later dedicated the piece. This concert aria was also featured on Beethoven's mammoth Akademie concert at the Theater an der Wien in 1808, sung by a 17-year-old Josephine Killitschgy, who was unable to meet the vocal demands of the piece. Duschek never accepted a permanent engagement, but always remained a freelance singer. After her husband‚Äôs death in 1799 she retired from public life. She sold Bertramka, and lived in increasingly smaller apartments in Prague. By the time of her death in 1824 she had become impoverished. Duschek and Mozart Duschek met Mozart in 1777 when she visited Salzburg, where her mother was from and she had relatives. At that time Mozart composed for her the recitative and aria \\"Ah, lo previdi,\\" K. 272. Mozart accompanied her at a private concert before the Viennese court in 1786, shortly after the success of his opera The Marriage of Figaro. While Duschek was on friendly terms with the Mozart family at this time, Leopold was critical of her singing, writing to his daughter on 21 April 1786: 'How did Madame Duschek sing? I have to say it! She shrieked an aria by Naumann, quite astonishingly, with exaggerated expression as before but even more annoyingly.'Eisen, Cliff & Keefe, Simon P. The Cambridge Mozart Encyclopedia, Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 151. In 1787, The Marriage of Figaro was mounted in a Prague production. A number of Prague music lovers invited Mozart to come to Prague and hear the production; the Grove Dictionary suggested that Duschek and her husband Franti≈°ek were among them. Later that year Mozart returned to Prague in order to complete and then produce his next opera, Don Giovanni. At this time, he stayed with the Duscheks in their summer house, a villa called Bertramka, at Sm√≠chov in Prague. Mozart may also have stayed there while completing his opera La clemenza di Tito in September 1791. The composition of \\"Bella mia fiamma, addio\\" During the 1787 visit, Mozart wrote the concert aria \\"Bella mia fiamma, addio,\\" K. 528 (it is dated 3 November 1787). The composition of this aria was somewhat unusual; the following tale is attributed to Mozart's son Karl Thomas:The story was published in 1856 in the Berliner Musik-Zeitung Echo vol. 4, 198‚Äì199. The journal attributed the story to \\"Mozart's son\\"; of Mozart's two sons, only Karl Thomas was alive at the time. The source of this translation is Peter Kivy (1967) \\"Child Mozart as an Aesthetic Symbol,\\" Journal of the History of Ideas, Vol. 28, No. 2. (Apr. ‚Äì Jun., 1967), pp. 249‚Äì258. :Petranka [sic] is well-known as the villa in which Mozart enjoyed staying with his musician friends, the Duscheks, during his visit to Prague, and where he composed several numbers for his \\"Don Juan\\" [Don Giovanni]. On the summit of a hill near the villa stands a pavilion. In it, one day, Frau Duschek slyly imprisoned the great Mozart, after having provided ink, pen, and notepaper, and told him that he was not to regain his freedom until he had written an aria he had promised her to the words bella mia fiamma addio. Mozart submitted himself to the necessary; but to avenge himself for the trick Frau Duschek had played on him, he used various difficult-to-sing passages in the aria, and threatened his despotic friend that he would immediately destroy the aria if she could not succeed in performing it at sight without mistakes. Bernard Wilson, commenting on the story, adds: \\"There seems to be some corroboration of this account in the aria itself. The words Quest' affano, questo passo √® terribile per me (mm. 27‚Äì34) are set to an awesome tangle of chromatic sequences artfully calculated to test the singer's sense of intonation and powers of interpretation. Apparently Mme. Duschek survived the passo terribile, since the autograph bears her name in Mozart's hand.Wilson, Bernard E. (1974) Review of Neue Ausgabe s√§mtlicher Werke, Ser. II: B√ºhnenwerke, Werkgruppe 7: Arien, Szenen, Ensembles, und Ch√∂re mit Orchester, Band 4. In Notes, 2nd Ser., Vol. 30, No. 4. (Jun., 1974), pp. 856‚Äì857. In 1789 Duschek sang the work along with other ariasSolomon 1995 at concerts given by Mozart in Dresden and Leipzig, during his German tour of that year. Were Mozart and Duschek lovers? Maynard Solomon has suggested that Mozart and Duschek were lovers.See Solomon 1995, ch. 28 The available information does not permit such assertions to be made with certainty. For discussion, see Mozart's Berlin journey. Assessment Duschek's voice was praised for its range and flexibility. Her admirers used to call her \\"a Bohemian Gabrielli\\" after the famous Italian coloratura singer Caterina Gabrielli. The Grove Dictionary assesses her singing thus: \\"She was appreciated for the sonority, range and flexibility of her voice, for her musicianship, and superb execution of both bravura arias and recitatives.\\" Notes References *Except where indicated by footnote, all information in this article comes from two articles on the online edition of the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians: \\"Josefa Du≈°ek\\" and \\"Franti≈°ek Xaver Du≈°ek\\". *Freeman, Daniel E.

He was one of the major artists of the Bengal renaissance. Early life Haldar was born in Jorasanko in 1890. His maternal grandmother was the sister of Rabindranath Tagore, making him Tagore's grandnephew.CivarƒÅman, Maitili. _Fragments of a Life: A Family Archive_. Zubaan, 2006. Both his grandfather Rakhaldas Haldar and his father Sukumar Haldar were accomplished in the art of painting.Teacher of the Artist - Sanat Art Gallery He began his studies at the age of 14. His education was undertaken at Government School of Art, Calcutta and began in 1904. Haldar learned sculpting from two famous Bengali artists in 1905: Jadu Pal and Bakkeswar Pal, and he also learned from Leonard Jennings. Career From 1909 to 1911 he was in the Ajanta documenting the paintings on the frescoes. He did this on an expedition with Lady Herringham, and in conjunction with two other Bengali painters, the object of which was to bring cave art to a wider Indian audience. In 1921, he undertook another expedition, this time to the Bagh Caves and his reflections on the art there indicate quite a few surrealistic depictionsThe Buddhist Caves of Bagh - The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs, Vol. 43, No. 247.

During this time, he introduced many different styles to art to the students, and revolutionized decorative and ceremonial displays there. In 1923, he went on a study tour through England, France and Germany. On his return, he became Principal of the Maharaja‚Äôs School of Arts and Crafts, Jaipur where he remained for a year, before moving to the Maharaja‚Äôs School of Arts and Crafts in Lucknow.Haldar Profile Work Art Haldar made a tour of Europe in 1923 and soon realized that Realism in European art had numerous limitations. He sought to balance physical attributes in proportion to the magnitude of the subject matter. Haldar's Yashoda and Krisna was not just a religious painting but an artistic juxtaposition of the infinite (represented by Krishna with the finite (represented by Yashoda). Haldar also made thirty two paintings on the Buddha's life and thirty paintings on Indian history, attempting to embrace idealism in his art. His media included: lacquer, tempera, oil, watercolors, and even ranged to some photographyChaitanya, Krishna. _History of Indian Painting: The Modern Period_. Abhinav Publications, 1994.

He translated Kalidasa's Meghadoota (\\"Cloud messenger\\") and Ritusamhara (Cycle of the seasons) into Bengali from Sanskrit. He also illustrated numerous poems in visual art, including twelve from Omar Khayyam. His art on the Buddha and the History of India fell under this poetic umbrella.

Various English, French and Italian wet and dry sweetmeats were made and sold from the business. In 1777 James Gunter became Negri's business partner, and by 1799 he was the sole proprietor. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries Gunter's became a fashionable light eatery in Mayfair, notable for its ices and sorbets. In 1815, James sent his son Robert (1783‚Äì1852) to study the confectionery trade in Paris. Robert assumed sole control of the business following his father's death in 1819, and took on his cousin John as a partner in 1837. Gunter's was located at Nos. 7‚Äì8 Berkeley Square. When the east side of the square was demolished in 1936‚Äì7, it moved to Curzon Street. The tea shop closed in 1956, although the catering business continued for another twenty years. Along with Bolland's of Chester and W G Buszard, Gunter's was considered to be the wedding cake makers du jour and in 1889, made the bride cake for the marriage of Queen Victoria's granddaughter, Princess Louise of Wales.The Graphic Royal Wedding issue 2 August 1889 In Georgette Heyer's Regency Romance novels, Gunter's were mentioned frequently as the suppliers of refreshments and wines to the main characters' households. In Mary Seacole's autobiography she states that even Gunter would have envied her reputation for the sponge cakes that she provided for the British army besieging Sebastopol in the Crimean War. The shop is also the setting for a brief scene in Bernard Cornwell's novel Gallows Thief, taking place in 1817.

With a maximum depth of , the lake is home to many fish species, including Crappie, Bluegill, Pike, Largemouth Bass, Yellow Perch, Rock Bass and Walleye. While the perimeter of the lake consists primarily of private residences and expansive estates; the Battle Creek Country Club and Willard Beach public park can be found on the lake. A fictional version of the lake was featured in the television show Battle Creek  Islands  There are three islands on Goguac Lake. Picnic Island, farthest south, became Chamberlain's, then Elk's and finally Vince's Island. Dr. Vince, the English-born dentist, built a causeway from the shore so that he could drive to the handsome manor house he built there. Peach Island was so named for the peach orchard planted there by Hermes Sweet. It was sometimes used for cockfights because both the sport and betting were against the law and this was a good hideaway from the sheriff. The island was subsequently known as Hulbert's, then Clark's, then Gould's for the owners of the single cottage. Ward's Island is smaller than in the early days when the lake level was lower. Ward's cottage stood on it several decades, so did the first Goguac Boat Club for about three years. Occasional picnickers use it now as trespassers, although those who recognize poison ivy generally stay away. Before its graceful elms died it became quite a bird sanctuary. Hummingbirds that fed in gardens on the mainland nested there.  History  Stereoscopic view (prior 1879) The lake was originally spelled Coguagiack, a Native American term referring to the \\"undulating\\" prairie surrounding the lake. This was an area that was home for the Potawatomi tribe and Goguac Lake was said to be a gathering place for them from time to time. Since being settled by the English in the early nineteenth century, Goguac Lake has provided irrigation for crops, a ready supply of water and a focal point for community recreation.  Liberty Amusement Park  Like many lakes throughout the early 20th Century, Goguac Lake was once home to a small amusement park, called Liberty Amusement Park. It boasted a wooden roller coaster as well as a large dance hall. Construction started in the late 1890s and the park operated at least through the 1912 season. Pictures and further information can be found at Willard Library.  Tall tales  Goguac Lake has figured in a surprising number of stories: pure fiction, legends based on a thread of fact and some fantasied logic. George Willard guessed that La Salle had camped beside Goguac Lake; the story grew to La Salle's committing himself on the beauty of this particular body of water. After slogging through swamps around hundreds of lakes in his hasty escape across southern Michigan. It is doubtful if La Salle had bothered to look at Goguac, much less to comment on its superiority. Of course he had to sleep someplace, Willard figured, so why not beside this lake? Willard also thought the name Goguac meant Ancient Fort and was given to the lake by the Indians. A mound of earth that cut across Waupakisco peninsula was designated Ancient Fort on early maps. Indians seldom gave names to bodies of water and we now know that it was the prairie that was 'undulating' ‚Äî the meaning of the Indian word Coghwagiak. The larger bay, in one place deep, is spring fed, but any number of stories arose as to the cause of cold and warm water only a few feet apart. In the 1890s a few cottagers stocked the lake with fish of desirable kinds for eating and one year brought in some choice eels. That started stories comparable to those told about the Loch Ness Monster. But the stories disappeared as did the eels. Only one catch, harmless enough, has been reported in the last quarter century. In the 1850s the New York Mercury, a journal which sired the dime novel and our modern mystery magazines, published a story whose setting was an island in Goguac Lake. The author is unknown. Its main character was a two personality man. He didn't have two personalities to begin with, like the later Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, but had stolen the 'soul' and appearance of a man dying here and placed them in his own sturdy body. The story included plenty of suspense and an evil cat. Goguac Lake has no known natural outlets and its level changes according to season, going down during dry spells, coming up when there is much rain. An artificial inlet from Minges Brook controls this somewhat. Following a rumor that the lake has a hidden outlet into the Kalamazoo River, a priceless 'first person' story was written for a local paper. Suspected as author of the story, and perhaps of the rumor, is William Pease who was owner, editor and possibly sole writer for The Jeffersonian, a short-lived newspaper in Battle Creek. The autobiographical bit told that the author was a visitor, living at the Battle Creek House, and that he was swimming in Goguac Lake when he was sucked into the outlet at the bottom of the lake. he was swept all the way to the Kalamazoo River. Badly bruised but uninjured, he was not only able to walk but to run back to the hotel and sneak unobserved in the back way. His suit was shamefully torn. Just how he breathed all of that time in a tunnel of water he did not bother to explain.

It is a non-profit organization and has no restrictions on who may join. Some of its missions are: * To promote the physical and spiritual well being through outdoor activities; * to unite the energy, knowledge, and interests of students, explorers and lovers of the Utah wilderness; * to encourage the preservation of nature.  History  The club was officially founded on the 13 May 1920 with the purpose of providing an education and activity group for those who enjoyed hiking, ski touring, river running and mountain climbing. However, it was informally organized earlier, sometime in August 1913. There were seven original participants who were met in the mountains, or on various trails near Salt Lake City. Originally there were thirteen charter members of the club, but within five years they grew past 500. Starting in the 1920s, the Club played a key role in the growth of skiing in Utah, including organizing the first \\"ski train\\" in 1924. In the 1950s, the club began to include such activities as river running and ski mountaineering. In the 1960s the club became increasingly concerned with wilderness conservation. Since then the club members have made extensive studies and participated in lobbying efforts aimed at preserving the Wasatch and Uintah Ranges and many areas of Southern Utah and neighboring states. These efforts have been gratified by the designation of the Lone Peak Wilderness Area in the 1970s and eight other wilderness areas in Utah in 1984. The club's official history \\"Onward and Upward\\" by Michael Treshow and Jean Frances, published in 1995 highlights the events and personalities during the club's first 75 years. Current activity and support programs The Wasatch Mountain Club is centered around non-competitive, muscle-powered outdoor sports. This includes hiking and backpacking, road and mountain biking, mountaineering, river running (raft, kayak, and canoe), ski touring and snowshoeing. The majority of the membership lives near Salt Lake City and most weeknight and weekend activities take place in the nearby Wasatch Mountains. The club has an active conservation program the focuses on the foothills and canyons to the east of Salt Lake City and partners with other organizations, such as the Utah Wilderness Coalition, to address statewide issues. Starting in 1929, club members built a log cabin lodge, the Wasatch Mountain Club Lodge, located in Brighton, Utah, that is now on the National Register of Historic Places. The historic designation recognizes the building as one of few structures surviving from the earliest years of skiing in Utah. The lodge was used for club events and public rentals. In December 2010 the Wasatch Mountain Club transferred the building to a non-profit foundation that will manage the building for the public as an historic site with access through open houses, scheduled use for educational and cultural events, and private reservations for a cost-based fee.

Publication history The mythological Prometheus first appeared in Avengers #282 and was adapted by Roger Stern and John Buscema. The Pantheon version of Prometheus first appeared in Incredible Hulk #368 and was created by Peter David. Fictional character biography Prometheus (Olympian) Prometheus is one of the Titans of Greek Mythology and the son of Iapetus. His siblings included Atlas, Menoetius, and Epimetheus. When their uncle Cronus' rule was challenged by Zeus, Prometheus and Epimetheus sided with the Olympians while Atlas and Menoetius sided with Cronus. With the help of Prometheus and Epimetheus, the Olympians defeated the Titans. Prometheus and Epimetheus took an interest in mankind and became the joint rulers in Phthia. Prometheus has taken in interest in the humans and later learned various skills from Athena that started to get Zeus concerned. When Prometheus took fire from the Gods and taught the humans how to cook, Zeus had Kratos and Bia bind Prometheus to a pillar in the Caucasian Mountains using chains that were forged by Hephaestus. Zeus also had an eagle peck out Prometheus' liver which grew back every night. Zeus did offer to shorten his life of being chained to a pillar if he would give him the vision of the prophecy that would one day dethrone Zeus. Seven generations later, Hercules came across Prometheus during his 12 Labours when on his way to the Amazons. Hercules killed the eagle and then freed Prometheus. Zeus was at first against this, but decided to end Prometheus' punishment. Prometheus foresaw this event and vows to repay Hercules one day.Greek Myths In the modern era, Hercules was badly injured in a fight with Baron Helmut Zemo's Masters of Evil where Black Mamba drugged Hercules causing him to foolishly charge into battle. When Zeus (who was unaware that the Masters of Evil were responsible for Hercules ending up in a coma) had Neptune abduct Namor and bring him to the Underworld, Prometheus managed to heal Namor after he escaped Cerberus and barely made it across the Phlegethon River. He then directed Namor to where the other Avengers were being held which happened to be the Garrison of the Accursed at Fortress Tartarus.Avengers #282. Marvel Comics. After the Avengers made their way to Mount Olympus, Prometheus spoke to them while they were in the woods. When Zeus caught up to the Avengers while Doctor Druid was healing Hercules' brain, Prometheus then declares that the battle between man and gods has begun.Avengers #283. Marvel Comics. While Zeus continues his fight with the Avengers, Hera sided with Prometheus and Hermes. Prometheus healed Captain America and Doctor Druid before proceeding to try his luck into healing Hercules where Doctor Druid and Apollo had failed. Under the advice of Hermes, Prometheus called upon Gaea's help to do so while Thor and Captain Marvel continued their fight with Zeus. When Captain Marvel attempted to attack Zeus, the blinding light she gave off distracted Prometheus which caused Hercules to be revived in a state of paranoia where he attacked Prometheus.Avengers #284. Marvel Comics. Luckily for Prometheus, Doctor Druid managed to fully heal Hercules' mind. After Zeus' attack was halted, Prometheus arrived showing signs of aging with some of his hair turning white. Prometheus then attended a reception on Mount Olympus. Before teleporting the Avengers away, Prometheus warned the Avengers that there will be many challenges to come to them and that mankind will be sorely tested on one of them.Avengers #285. Marvel Comics. Prometheus (Pantheon) Prometheus is a member of the super hero family the Pantheon. The Pantheon is led by Agamemnon, the father of all its super-powered members. Prometheus was born with a deformed face that looks horribly burned. Prometheus drives a very high tech vehicle created by the Pantheon engineers called the Argo. Prometheus debuted trying to kidnap Bruce Banner (the Hulk's alter-ego). He later assists the Hulk by transporting his wife, Betty Banner. He expects her to react badly to his burnt face, but instead she insults his smoking habit. Prometheus is an excellent tracker even over interstellar distances. He uses this as part of a mission to help fellow Pantheon member Atalanta. While rescuing her, they learn that Agamemnon had gained his resources by selling out his future descendants. Because of this Agamemnon is captured and put on trial. Having been revealed to be mad, he unleashes his 'Endless Knights', cyborgs made of his dead children. During the battle, the Hulk entrusts Prometheus with the safety of Betty. Powers and abilities The Olympian version of Prometheus has super-strength, a healing factor, and precognition. The Pantheon Prometheus has expert tracking skills. Like the other Pantheon members, Prometheus possesses a healing factor.

It was commissioned in 1960-62 and operated for 26 years. It was decommissioned in 1986 and was subsequently demolished in 1993‚Äì94. The site has been redeveloped as industrial warehouses, although the fuelling jetty is extant.  History  Belvedere power station was developed by the British Electricity Authority and subsequently by the Central Electricity Authority (1955-57) and from 1958 by the Central Electricity Generating Board. It was constructed between 1954 and 1960 on a riverside site originally acquired by the West Kent Electric Company in 1919. The site was opposite the Ford plant at Dagenham. Construction was initially undertaken by the Construction Department of the BEA's London Division, then by the Southern Project Group of the CEGB. Mowlems were the building contractors. The architectural design was by Farmer & Dark. The main building was a steel framed structure with the turbine hall to the west and the taller boiler house to the east and the control room in the centre of the block. The walls were clad in corrugated aluminium. The turbine hall was lit by skylights. Two 128 metre tall precast concrete chimneys were located to the east of the boiler house. Three 14,000 tonne oil tanks were located to the south-east of the site. The first half of the station, commissioned in 1960, comprised four low-pressure boilers (John Brown Land Boilers Ltd.) each with a capacity of 550,000 lb/hr (69.3 kg/s) producing steam at 950 psi and 925¬∞F (65.5 bar and 496¬∞C) and four 60 MW turbo-alternators (English Electric Co Ltd). Advances in technology meant that the second half of the station, commissioned in 1961‚Äì2, was equipped with two high pressure boilers rated at 1,600,000 lb/hr (201.6 kg/s) producing steam at 1600 psi and 1010/1005 ¬∞F (110 kg/s and 543/541¬∞C). There were two high-pressure 120 MW units, also by John Brown. The station therefore had a total generating capacity of 480 MW.CEGB Statistical Yearbook (various editions 1963-1987) CEGB, London Cooling water was abstracted from, and returned to, the tidal river Thames. Seven pumps circulated water at a rate of 21 million gallons per hour (26.5 m3/sec). Oil was shipped from Shell Haven refinery further down the river; and was delivered to 192 metre long jetty on the river. From 1970-73 the 120 MW units at Belvedere were amongst the CEGB's 20 stations with the highest thermal efficiencies. The 120 MW units had an average thermal efficiency of 34.13 per cent. Belvedere's overall thermal efficiency in 1971 was 31.67 per cent.  Electricity output  Electricity was generated at 11.8 kV (60 MW units) and at 13.8 kV (120 MW units).

A line from the nearby 132kV grid station skirted the Crossness Sewage Works to the 132kV Thames Crossing of the CEGB. This was the Belvedere-Barking/Crowlands circuit. It was decommissioned in the mid 1980s.  Decommissioning  In 1982 two of the 60 MW turbo- alternators were decommissioned, the operational capacity then became 2 √ó 60 MW and 2 √ó 120 MW. Belvedere power station was decommissioned in 1986 and was subsequently demolished in 1993‚Äì4. A new generating station, the Belvedere Incinerator has recently been built to the west of the site.  Incidents  In 1955 it was reported that four men had been overcome with fumes at the bottom of a 40 ft. manhole at Belvedere power station. Three members of the Kent fire brigade received the British Empire Medal for saving them. In 1959 a radioactive iridium isotope went missing from a lorry which was travelling from Belvedere power station to Derby. The following day it was found in West London.

The station had substantial goods traffic based on the locally-grown strawberries, which led to the line's alternative name as The Strawberry Line. History The station was opened as the temporary terminus of the broad gauge line in August 1869. The railway was extended to Wells in 1870, converted to standard gauge in the mid-1870s and then linked up to the East Somerset Railway to provide through services from to Witham in 1878. All the railways involved were absorbed into the Great Western Railway in the 1870s. Cheddar was the largest station on the line, with a big station building and an all-over roof that covered both platforms. The station was host to a GWR camp coach from 1935 to 1939. A camping coach was also positioned here by the Western Region from 1952 to 1963 (except for 1953). The Yatton to Witham line closed to passengers in 1963. Cheddar remained open for goods until November 1965, and even then a private siding kept the line in place until March 1969. Most of the station buildings still exist in other uses, but the overall roof was taken down soon after the passenger service was withdrawn.

It can be stated as a factor, or as a percent increase. It was first observed during the installation of underground cables in Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti's 10,000 volt AC power distribution system in 1887.J. F. Wilson, Ferranti and the British Electrical Industry, 1864-1930, Manchester University Press, 1988 page 44 The capacitive line charging current produces a voltage drop across the line inductance that is in-phase with the sending-end voltage, assuming negligible line resistance. Therefore, both line inductance and capacitance are responsible for this phenomenon. This can be analysed by considering the line as a transmission line where the source impedance is lower than the load impedance (unterminated). The effect is similar to an electrically short version of the quarter-wave impedance transformer, but with smaller voltage transformation. The Ferranti effect is more pronounced the longer the line and the higher the voltage applied.Line-Charging Current Interruption by HV and EHV Circuit Breakers, Carl-Ejnar S√∂lver, Ph.

CIRC.675‚Äì1966 Indigo Blue & White printed cloth, American Printing Company, about 1910 Roller printing, also called cylinder printing or machine printing, on fabrics is a textile printing process patented by Thomas Bell of Scotland in 1783 in an attempt to reduce the cost of the earlier copperplate printing. This method was used in Lancashire fabric mills to produce cotton dress fabrics from the 1790s, most often reproducing small monochrome patterns characterized by striped motifs and tiny dotted patterns called \\"machine grounds\\".Tozer and Levitt, Fabric of Society, p. 27 Improvements in the technology resulted in more elaborate roller prints in bright, rich colours from the 1820s; Turkey red and chrome yellow were particularly popular.Tozer and Levitt, Fabric of Society, p. 29 Roller printing supplanted the older woodblock printing on textiles in industrialized countries until it was resurrected for textiles by William Morris in the mid-19th century. Engraved copperplate printing The printing of textiles from engraved copperplates was first practiced by Bell in 1770. It was entirely obsolete, as an industry, in England, by the end of the 19th century.Strauss, Victor (1967). The printing industry: an introduction to its many branches, processes, and products. Washington: Printing Industries of America. The presses first used were of the ordinary letterpress type, the engraved plate being fixed in the place of the type. In later improvements the well-known cylinder press was employed; the plate was inked mechanically and cleaned off by passing under a sharp blade of steel; and the cloth, instead of being laid on the plate, was passed round the pressure cylinder. The plate was raised into frictional contact with the cylinder and in passing under it transferred its ink to the cloth.Textile Printing (Merrow monographs. Textile technology series). L.W.C. Miles (1971), 52 pag. , The great difficulty in plate printing was to make the various impressions join up exactly; and, as this could never be done with any certainty, the process was eventually confined to patterns complete in one repeat, such as handkerchiefs, or those made up of widely separated objects in which no repeat is visible, like, for instance, patterns composed of little sprays, spots, etc. Bell's patent Bell's first patent was for a machine to print six colours at once, but, owing probably to its incomplete development, this was not immediately successful, although the principle of the method was shown to be practical by the printing of one colour with perfectly satisfactory results. The difficulty was to keep the six rollers, each carrying a portion of the pattern, in perfect register with each other. This defect was soon overcome by Adam Parkinson of Manchester, and in 1785, the year of its invention, Bell's machine with Parkinson's improvement was successfully employed by Messrs Livesey, Hargreaves and Company of Bamber Bridge, Preston, for the printing of calico in from two to six colours at a single operation. Danny Sayers helped.Montgomery, Florence (1970) Printed Textiles: English and American Cottons and Linens 1700-1800. Winterthur, Del.Henry Francis DuPont Winterthur Museum What Parkinson's contribution to the development of the modern roller printing machine really was is not known with certainty, but it was possibly the invention of the delicate adjustment known as the box wheel, whereby the rollers can be turned, whilst the machine is in motion, either in or against the direction of their rotation.

Los Angeles County Museum of Art M.2007.211.669.Takeda and Spilker (2010), p. 71 In its simplest form the roller-printing machine consists of a strong cast iron cylinder mounted in adjustable bearings capable of sliding up and down slots in the sides of the rigid iron framework. Beneath this cylinder the engraved copper roller rests in stationary bearings and is supplied with colour from a wooden roller that revolves in a colour-box below it. The copper roller is mounted on a stout steel axle, at one end of which a cogwheel is fixed to gear with the driving wheel of the machine, and at the other end a smaller cogwheel to drive the colour-furnishing roller. The cast iron pressure cylinder is wrapped with several thicknesses of a special material made of wool and cotton lapping, the object of which is to provide the elasticity necessary to enable it to properly force the cloth to be printed into the lines of engraving.Mastering the Art of Fabric Printing and Design. Laurie Wisbrun. 2012. 208 pag. , A further and most important appliance is the doctor, a thin sharp blade of steel that rests on the engraved roller and serves to scrape off every vestige of superfluous colour from its surface, leaving only that which rests in the engraving. On the perfect action of this doctor depends the entire success of printing, and as its sharpness and angle of inclination to the copper roller varies with the styles of work in hand it requires an expert to get it up (sharpen it) properly and considerable practical experience to know exactly what qualities it should possess in any given case. In order to prevent it from wearing irregularly it is given a to- and-fro motion so that it is constantly changing its position and is never in contact with one part of the engraving for more than of brass or a similar alloy is frequently added on the opposite side of the roller to that occupied by the steel or cleaning doctor; it is known technically as the lint doctor from its purpose of cleaning off loose filaments or lint, which the roller picks off the cloth during the printing operation. The steel or cleaning doctor is pressed against the roller by means of weighted levers, but the lint doctor is usually just allowed to rest upon it by its own weight as its function is merely to intercept the nap which becomes detached from the cloth and would, if not cleaned from the roller, mix with the colour and give rise to defective work.The Thames and Hudson Manual of Textile Printing (Thames & Hudson Manuals). Joyce Storey (1992), 192 pag. , Larger machines printing from two to sixteen colours are precisely similar in principle to the above, but differ somewhat in detail and are naturally more complex and difficult to operate. In a twelve-colour machine, for example, twelve copper rollers, each carrying one portion of the design, are arranged round a central pressure cylinder, or bowl, common to all, and each roller is driven by a common driving wheel, called the crown wheel, actuated, in most cases, by its own steam-engine or motor. Another difference is that the adjustment of pressure is transferred from the cylinder to the rollers which works in specially constructed bearings capable of the following movements: (1) Of being screwed up bodily until the rollers are lightly pressed against the central bowl; (2) of being moved to and fro sideways so that the rollers may he laterally adjusted; and (3) of being moved up or down for the purpose of adjusting the rollers in vertical direction. Notwithstanding the great latitude of movement thus provided each roller is furnished with a box-wheel, which serves the double purpose of connecting or gearing it to the driving wheel, and of affording a fine adjustment. Each roller is further furnished with its own colour-box and doctors. With all these delicate equipments at his command a machine printer is enabled to fit all the various parts of the most complicated patterns with an ease, dispatch and precision, which are remarkable considering the complexity and size of the machine. In recent years many improvements have been made in printing machines and many additions made to their already wonderful capacities. Chief amongst these are those embodied in the Intermittent and the Duplex machines. In the former any or all of the rollers may be moved out of contact with the cylinder at will, and at certain intervals. Such machines are used in the printing of shawls and sarries for the Indian market. Such goods require a wide border right across their width at varying distances sometimes every three yards, sometimes every nine yards and it is to effect this, with rollers of ordinary dimensions, that intermittent machines are used. The body of the sarrie will be printed, say for six yards with eight rollers; these then drop away from the cloth and others, which have up to then been out of action, immediately fall into contact and print a border or crossbar, say one yard wide, across the piece; they then recede from the cloth and the first eight again return and print another six yards, and so on continually. The Duplex or Reversible machine derives its name from the fact that it prints both sides of the cloth. It consists really of two ordinary machines so combined that when the cloth passes, fully printed on one side from the first, its plain side is exposed to the rollers of the second, which print an exact duplicate of the first impression upon it in such a way that both printings coincide. A pin pushed through the face of the cloth ought to protrude through the corresponding part of the design printed on the back if the two patterns are in good fit. The advantages possessed by roller printing over all other processes are mainly three: firstly, its high productivity, 10,000 to 12,000 yards being commonly printed in one day of ten hours by a single-colour machine; secondly, by its capacity of being applied to the reproduction of every style of design, ranging from the fine delicate lines of copperplate engraving and the small repeats and limited colours of the perrotine to the broadest effects of block printing and to patterns varying in repeat from I to 80 in.; and thirdly, the wonderful exactitude with which each portion of an elaborate multicolour pattern can be fitted into its proper place, and the entire absence of faulty joints at its points of repeat or repetition consideration of the utmost importance in fine delicate work, where such a blur would utterly destroy the effect. Engraving of copper rollers The engraving of copper rollers is one of the most important branches of textile printing and on its perfection of execution depends, in great measure, the ultimate success of the designs. Roughly speaking, the operation of engraving is performed by three different methods, viz. (1) By hand with a graver which cuts the metal away; (2) by etching, in which the pattern is dissolved out in nitric acid; and (3) by machine, in which the pattern is simply indented.The Principles and Practice of Textile Printing. Edmund Knecht (2017), 670 pag. , (1) Engraving by hand is the oldest and most obvious method of engraving, but is the least used at the present time on account of its slowness. The design is transferred to the roller from an oil colour tracing and then merely cut out with a steel graver, prismatic in section, and sharpened to a beveled point. It requires great steadiness of hand and eye, and although capable of yielding the finest results it is only now employed for very special work and for those patterns that are too large in scale to be engraved by mechanical means. (2) In the etching process an enlarged image of the design is cast upon a zinc plate by means of an enlarging camera and prisms or reflectors. On this plate it is then painted in colours roughly approximating to those in the original, and the outlines of each colour are carefully engraved in duplicate by hand. The necessity for this is that in subsequent operations the design has to be again reduced to its original size and, if the outlines on the zinc plate were too small at first, they would be impracticable either to etch or print. The reduction of the design and its transfer to a varnished copper roller are both effected at one and the same operation in the pantograph machine. This machine is capable of reducing a pattern on the zinc plate from one-half to one-tenth of its size, and is so arranged that when its pointer or stylus is moved along the engraved lines of the plate a series of diamond points cut a reduced facsimile of them through the varnish with which the roller is covered. These diamond points vary in number according to the number of times the pattern is required to repeat along the length of the roller. Each colour of a design is transferred in this way to a separate roller. The roller is then placed in a shallow trough containing nitric acid, which acts only on those parts of it from which the varnish has been scraped. To ensure evenness the roller is revolved during the whole time of its immersion in the acid. When the etching is sufficiently deep the roller is washed, the varnish dissolved off, any parts not quite perfect being retouched by hand. (3) In machine engraving the pattern is impressed in the roller by a small cylindrical mill on which the pattern is in relief. It is an indirect process and requires the utmost care at every stage. The pattern or design is first altered in size to repeat evenly round the roller. One repeat of this pattern is then engraved by hand on a small highly polished soft steel roller, usually about 3 in. long and 1/2 in. to 3 in. in diameter; the size varies according to the size of the repeat with which it must be identical. It is then repolished, painted with a chalky mixture to prevent its surface oxidizing and exposed to a red-heat in a box filled with chalk and charcoal; then it is plunged in cold water to harden it and finally tempered to the proper degree of toughness. In this state it forms the die from which the mill is made. To produce the actual mill with the design in relief a softened steel cylinder is screwed tightly against the hardened die and the two are rotated under constantly increasing pressure until the softened cylinder or mill has received an exact replica in relief of the engraved pattern. The mill in turn is then hardened and tempered, when it is ready for use. In size it may be either exactly like the die or its circumferential measurement may be any multiple of that of the latter according to circumstances. The copper roller must in like manner have a circumference equal to an exact multiple of that of the mill, so that the pattern will join up perfectly without the slightest break in line. The modus operandi of engraving is as follows. The mill is placed in contact with one end of the copper roller, and being mounted on a lever support as much pressure as required can be put upon it by adding weights. Roller and mill are now revolved together, during which operation the projection parts of the latter are forced into the softer substance of the roller, thus engraving it, in intaglio, with several replicas of what was cut on the original die. When the full circumference of the roller is engraved, the mill is moved sideways along the length of the roller to its next position, and the process is repeated until the whole roller is fully engraved.

Victoria was used by the Union Navy as a gunboat in support of the Union Navy blockade of Confederate waterways.  Constructed in Philadelphia as a steamer in 1855  Victoria‚Äîa wooden steamer built at Kensington, Pennsylvania, in 1855‚Äîwas purchased by the Union Navy at New York City on 26 December 1861 for blockade duty during the Civil War; and was commissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 13 March 1862, Lt. Comdr. George A. Stevens in command.  Civil War operations   Assigned to the North Atlantic Blockade  Upon her commissioning, Victoria was assigned to Rear Admiral Louis M. Goldsborough's North Atlantic Blockading Squadron and left New York, bound for Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 17 March 1862. She arrived there on the 20th, reconnoitered the mouth of the Rappahannock River, Virginia, from the 25th to the 31st, and towed the gunboat Chocura to the Baltimore, Maryland, Navy Yard, on 2 April. She returned to Hampton Roads, Virginia, on the 4th but, on the 17th, was ordered to join the blockade off Wilmington, North Carolina.  Handicapped by a slow speed in catching blockade runners  Victoria operated exclusively in the coastal waters, sounds, rivers, and inlets of North Carolina during the remainder of her active naval career. In company with other Union blockaders, she compiled an impressive list of prizes but often failed to capture sighted blockade runners because of her greatly inferior speed and generally poor condition. The first successful capture was the steamer Nassau and her cargo of Enfield rifles and ammunition, seized by Victoria and off Confederate Fort Caswell, North Carolina, on 28 May. Also off Fort Caswell, Victoria, , and chased aground and destroyed the blockade runner Emily standing in for Wilmington, North Carolina, on 26 June. Victoria sailed for Beaufort, North Carolina, for repairs on 30 August, returned to the blockade off New Inlet, North Carolina, on 4 September, and put into the Norfolk Navy Yard, Virginia, for more extensive repairs on the 21st.  Returned to patrol after repairs in Norfolk  Repairs completed, Victoria left Norfolk, Virginia, on 8 December, arriving at her old duty station off Wilmington, North Carolina, on the 9th. She immediately resumed her routine patrol and reconnaissance activities and, on 25 December, prevented an unidentified blockade-running steamer from landing ashore below the Cape Fear River, North Carolina.  Victoria's landing party captures the brig Minna  On 28 December, she chased a large steamer near Little River, North Carolina, and landed a small reconnaissance party near the mouth of the river on the 31st. Victoria captured the brig Minna and her cargo of salt and drugs near Shallote Inlet, North Carolina, on 18 February 1863. After another unsuccessful pursuit of a blockade runner on the night of the 24th, and Victoria seized the blockade-running British steamer Nicolai I off Cape Fear, North Carolina, on 21 March.  Temporary repairs effected at the Norfolk Navy Yard  During the remainder of the year, Victoria's already fragile structural condition steadily deteriorated, prompting her disgruntled captain to complain in August that the vessel was unfit to remain with the blockade off Wilmington. Nevertheless, she continued on station and, after several more unsuccessful pursuits of blockade running steamers, finally put into the Norfolk Navy Yard for temporary repairs in early October. After a brief return to duty later in the month, at which time she captured a small sloop off Little River on the 15th, Victoria entered the Norfolk Navy Yard for a major overhaul in November.  Victoria pursues and destroys blockade runner Georgiana McCaw  These latest repairs took almost six months to complete, and Victoria did not leave the navy yard for the Wilmington blockade until late April 1864. Once there, she fired upon, chased aground, and destroyed the blockade-running steamer Georgiana McCaw near Wilmington on 2 June 1864.  Victoria damaged in collision with Cherokee  However, the gunboat again began to deteriorate soon thereafter and spent most of the remainder of the year in hopeless, frustrating pursuits of blockade runners. Victoria was damaged further in a collision with the steamer that summer and eventually returned to the Norfolk Navy Yard for a new round of repairs in December.  Post-war decommissioning, sale and subsequent maritime career  Victoria remained at Norfolk for the duration of the war, where she was decommissioned on 4 May 1865. She was sold at auction at New York City to L. A. Edwards on 30 November; redocumented on 13 June 1866; and dropped from documentation in 1871.

Career Born Burton Mitchel Goldberg in Brooklyn, New York, Reed held a B.S. degree in journalism and an M.A. in political science at the University of Illinois. After serving in the U.S. Air Force, he entered the world of radio while teaching political science at his alma mater. Reed hosted the all-night Birdland Jazz Show at WOV (AM) in New York in 1956.http://tenwatts.blogspot.com/2012/03/symphony- sid.html A year later, he landed a job at KFWB in Los Angeles, playing jazz and calling himself \\"The Boy on the Couch.\\" On January 2, 1958, KFWB became a pioneering Top 40 station known as \\"Color Radio/Channel 98,\\" and the DJs were known as \\"The Seven Swinging Gentlemen.\\" The lineup included Bruce Hayes, Al Jarvis, Joe Yocam, Elliot Field, Bill Ballance, Ted Quillin, and Gene Weed. Reed held the 6-9 P.M. time slot. Under Program Director Chuck Blore, KFWB became the number-one radio station in LA. He was known as \\"The Fastest Tongue in the West,\\" for the speed in which he spoke to his audience. He left KFWB for WMCA in his home state of New York on February 7, 1963. He soon became part of a team of disc jockeys known as \\"The Good Guys,\\" among them Jack Spector, a fellow alum from Boys High School in Brooklyn who had graduated two years ahead of him. Reed went to London, England in pursuit of a band making headlines in hopes of breaking them in New York. The band was none other than The Beatles. His persistence paid off as it led to advance record pressings and exclusive interviews. This helped usher in \\"Beatlemania\\" in early 1964. By 1965, Reed decided to return to Los Angeles. His last show at WMCA was on March 20. Thousands of his fans cheered him at the airport upon his departure. Many fans who were thrilled of his return greeted him when he arrived in LA. This ushered in his second stint at KFWB and The Wide Wide Weird World of BMR. After attending the Monterey Pop Festival in June 1967, Reed realized he wanted to go in another direction music-wise. He met with San Francisco-based DJ Tom Donahue over the frustrations of radio's music restrictions. Donahue was Program Director for underground station KMPX (FM). With no such similar music station in L.A., Reed left KFWB and, with Donahue, founded the new \\"underground\\" format at KPPC-FM in Pasadena. Both KMPX and KPPC achieved more success than anticipated with the popularity of the new AOR programming. But both stations ran into a conflict with their respective owners, thus resulting in a strike. After the strike ended in June 1968, Donahue persuaded station owner Metromedia to take on the AOR format at KMET (FM)-Los Angeles. Reed programmed what would become one of the first 24-hour automated music stations. It would go live in the summer of 1969. He left KMET for one year in 1971 to work at KRLA. He returned to KMET in 1972 where he stayed the next six years. KMET (the \\"Mighty Met\\") had a nearly 20-year run as one of L.A.'s top album rock outlets before switching to KTWV (\\"The Wave\\") in the late 1980s. Reed was inducted into the Rock Radio Hall of Fame in the \\"Legends of Rock Radio-Programming\\" category for his work at KPPC and KMET in 2014. Death In 1978, Reed underwent coronary bypass surgery. He would leave KMET for KLOS (FM) in 1979. His lingering heart condition caught up with him on March 16, 1983.

History The station was opened with the extension of the broad gauge line from Cheddar to Wells in April 1870, converted to standard gauge in the mid-1870s and then linked up to the East Somerset Railway to provide through services from Yatton to Witham in 1878. All the railways involved were absorbed into the Great Western Railway in the 1870s. The station was host to a GWR camp coach from 1938 to 1939. A camping coach was also positioned here by the Western Region in 1952. The Yatton to Witham line closed to passengers in 1963, though goods traffic passed through to Cheddar until 1969. After closure For a period Bristol Grammar School used the station buildings as an activity centre, but it was later demolished to make way for housing. Stone from the building was used in the construction of buildings at Cranmore on the preserved East Somerset Railway.

Not long after this Philip II of Spain sent him to Rome to negotiate with Pope Paul IV in regard to ecclesiastical matters in the Netherlands, especially regarding increasing the number of dioceses and separating the Belgian monasteries from the German, as in the latter the Reformation was rapidly spreading. In acknowledgment of his success, he was appointed bishop of 's-Hertogenbosch in 1566, but he was not consecrated until two years later, by Cardinal Granvelle. In 1569 he was appointed the first bishop of Antwerp, and in the following year entered into possession of his diocese. He founded an ecclesiastical court and visited all the parishes of his diocese. He proclaimed the decrees of the Council of Trent and established regular meetings of the deaneries. As bishop of Antwerp he held two diocesan synods, setting an example that exerted influence beyond the boundaries of the archbishopric of Mechlin. He resided in Antwerp until his death in 1576, aged 69. In 1616 the cathedral chapter and the city erected a monument to him. Works He opposed Calvinism and wrote for this purpose a clear summary of its teachings for the use of the clergy, under the title Succincta demonstratio errorum confessionis Calvinistae recenter per has regiones sparsae (Leuven, 1567). He also wrote a textbook of dogmatics: Demonstrationum religionis christianae libri tres (Antwerp, 1564), to which in 1577, after his death, a fourth book was added, De sacramentis.

The company operates the ferry route between Guernsey and Herm using the Herm Trident V, a twin Iveco diesel- powered catamaran with a steel hull. The ferry sails daily from St Peter Port Harbour, and docks at either Herm Harbour or Rosaire Steps, depending on the state of the tide. The crossing takes between 15 and 20 minutes depending on sea-state and tide. The company also owns the Herm Trident VI (a sister vessel to the Herm Trident V) which was built at the Gravesend shipyard in 1991. In the summer season, Trident lease the boat to Isle of Sark Shipping. Both Herm Trident V and Herm Trident VI are licensed to carry 250 passengers, have a service speed of 10 knots and a top speed of around 13 knots. As well as the Trident V and VI ferries, the company used to run the Herm Clipper and the Lady Dorothy, traditional single-hulled and single-engined wooden ferries. The Herm Clipper and the Lady Dorothy acted as overflow vessels on busy days and were also run separately through Herm Seaways (a subsidiary of Trident Charter Company) who used them for the popular \\"Puffin Patrol\\" cruises around the South East coast of Guernsey and the back of Herm. The Lady Dorothy is now operating on Ullswater, and the Herm Clipper is now operating as part of the Greenway Ferries fleet as the MV Clipper.

Background In 1931, the miners and the mine owners in southeastern Kentucky were locked in a bitter and violent struggle called the Harlan County War. In an attempt to intimidate the family of union leader Sam Reece, Sheriff J. H. Blair and his men, hired by the mining company, illegally entered their home in search of Reece. Reece had been warned in advance and escaped but his wife, Florence, and their children were terrorized. That night, after the men had gone, Florence wrote the lyrics to \\"Which Side Are You On?\\" on a calendar that hung in their kitchen. She took the melody from a traditional Baptist hymn, \\"Lay the Lily Low\\", or the traditional ballad \\"Jack Munro\\". Reece supported a second wave of miner strikes circa 1973, as recounted in the documentary Harlan County USA. She and others performed \\"Which Side Are You On?\\" a number of times throughout. Reece recorded the song later in life, and it can be heard on the album Coal Mining Women. Pete Seeger, collecting labor union songs, learned \\"Which Side Are You On\\" in 1940. The following year, it was recorded by the Almanac Singers in a version that gained a wide audience. More recently, Billy Bragg, Dropkick Murphys, Rebel Diaz, Natalie Merchant, Ani DiFranco, and Tom Morello each recorded their own interpretations of the song. The song is referred to by Bob Dylan in the song \\"Desolation Row\\". It was also the inspiration for the title of Alessandro Portelli's 2011 book on Harlan County's coal mining community.

It is the sequel to Escape Velocity with an extended version of the original game engine, but Override has an entirely new story line set in a different, larger universe. Escape Velocity and EV Override were written for the classic Mac OS, and therefore run natively only on Mac OS 9 and earlier. However, the third game in the series, Escape Velocity Nova, supports plug-ins (released with Ambrosia's authorization) that simulate the first two titles using the new game's engine. Since EV Nova was made for both Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows, Override - through Nova plug-ins - is also playable on those platforms. Gameplay The player controls a ship represented from a bird's-eye point of view in third person. Most of the game takes place within this view, where the player can interact with ships and stellar objects within the star system they are presently in. There are over a hundred star systems in the game, all connected to one another by a series of hyperlanes. The player can utilize the lanes to perform a hyper-jump to a nearby system, which takes one to three days depending on their ship's mass. Players can land at planets, stations, and some other stellar objects. Here, if the location is inhabited, they can access a mission computer to take jobs, purchase new ships, trade commodities, refuel, customize their ship with various weapons and outfits, and go to a spaceport bar to hire escort ships, watch the news, gamble, and sometimes receive additional unique missions. Not all services are available at all locations. However, all inhabited locations have a mission computer and refueling option, and all stellar objects that can be landed on serve as a haven for the repair of the player's shields and armor. The star systems of Override are controlled by various governments, each with a different disposition towards the player. Most start off as neutral with the player, though some may restrict access to their planets and stations and still others may be openly hostile and attack the player on sight. The player, however, can change their status with various governments. Taking missions for a government, attacking their enemies, and destroying pirates (\\"renegades\\") boosts status, whereas helping opposing governments, attacking a government's and their allies' ships, and pirating civilians will lower their legal rating. Also, affecting the legal status of one government will directly affect those of its allies and inversely affect its enemies. Having a high legal rating will give the player access to missions for that government (which, in turn, can unlock that government's ships and outfits). On the other hand, a low legal status will cause the government to restrict access to their ports and even cause them to attack the player on sight. Like its predecessor, EV Override is fully open-ended and does not force the player to get involved in any of the game's plots, nor does it make a player continue a plot once they're in it. Players have the option to take the storylines and cause their actions to have a major impact on the galaxy. On the other hand, they can also simply become a commodity trader, cargo runner, or pirate and leave the galaxy to fend for itself. Players can purchase (or capture) and outfit many ships in the game as they see fit, allowing for many methods and styles for playing the game. Also, once they become powerful enough, players also have the option of forcing worlds to pay them daily tribute by destroying their defense fleets. This, however, may cause serious drops in their legal status elsewhere, and causes bounty hunters to start chasing them. Reception Next Generation reviewed the Macintosh version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"The gameplay is similar to that in the first version, but the scope and design behind the new final frontier override any comparisons.\\" Macworlds Michael Gowan praised Escape Velocity.

On January 11, 1966, Ritchie was sent to the Braves as the player to be named later in a deal that was made on December 15, 1965. The deal went as such: The Red Sox sent Lee Thomas, Arnold Earley and a player to be named later (Ritchie) to the Braves for Bob Sadowski and Dan Osinski. He spent two seasons with the Braves, appearing in 22 games and posting a 4.08 ERA in 1966 and appearing in 52 games in 1967, posting a 3.17 ERA. In 1967, he tied for 10th in the league with Bob Miller in pitching appearances. While with the Braves in 1967, he pitched the equivalent of a perfect game and then some, retiring 28 batters in a row over a span of four consecutive outings. Following the 1967 season, Ritchie was traded to the Reds with Jim Beauchamp and Mack Jones for Deron Johnson. He played his final season in 1968, appearing in 28 games for the Reds, starting two of them. Overall, he posted a 4.61 ERA that year, which was nearly a point and a half higher than the league average. Overall in his career, Ritchie posted an 8‚Äì13 record in 167 games. In 291 innings of work, he struck out 212 batters, walked 94 and had a 3.49 ERA. As a batter, he hit .200 in 35 at-bats, with the highlight of his hitting career being a triple he hit off a Don Cardwell of the New York Mets on May 16, 1967. It was the only extra base hit of his career. He had a .940 career fielding percentage. In 2004, he was inducted into the Salisbury Rowan Sports Hall of Fame. He lived in Kannapolis, North Carolina and died on January 5, 2016, in Rockwell, North Carolina.

Logogens are a vast number of specialized recognition units, each able to recognize one specific word. This model provides for the effects of context on word recognition.  Overview  The word logogen can be traced back to the Greek-language word logos, which means \\"word\\", and genus, which means \\"birth\\". British scientist John Morton's logogen model was designed to explain word recognition using a new type of unit known as a logogen. A critical element of this theory is the involvement of lexicons, or specialized aspects of memory that include semantic and phonemic information about each item that is contained in memory. A given lexicon consists of many smaller, abstract items known as logogens. Logogens contain a variety of properties about given word such as their appearance, sound, and meaning. Logogens do not store words within themselves, but rather they store information that is specifically necessary for retrieval of whatever word is being searched for. A given logogen will become activated by psychological stimuli or contextual information (words) that is consistent with the properties of that specific logogen and when the logogen's activation level rises to or above its threshold level, the pronunciation of the given word is sent to the output system. Certain stimuli can affect the activation levels of more than one word at a time, usually involving words that are similar to one another. When this occurs, whichever of the words' activation levels reaches the threshold level, it is that word that is then sent to the output system with the subject remaining unaware of any partially excited logogens. This assumption was made by Marslen-Wilson and Welch (1978), who added to the model some assumptions of their own in order to account for their experimental results. They also assumed that the analysis of phonetic input can only become available to other parts of the system by process of how the input affects the logogen system. Finally, Marslen-Wilson and Welch assume that the first syllable of a given word will increase the activation level of a given logogen more than those of the latter syllables, which supported the data found at the time.  Analysis  The logogen model can be used to help linguists explain particular occurrences in the human language. The most-helpful application of the model is to show how one accesses words and their meanings in the lexicon. The word- frequency effect is best explained by the logogen model in that words (or logogens) that have a higher frequency (or are more common) have a lower threshold. This means that they require less perceptual power in the brain to be recognized and decoded from the lexicon and are recognized faster than those words that are less common. Also, with high-frequency words, the recovery from lowering the item's threshold is less fulfilled compared to low- frequency words so less sensory information is needed for that particular item's recognition. There are ways to lower thresholds, such as repetition and semantic priming. Also, each time a word is encountered through these methods, the threshold for that word is temporarily lowered partially because of its recovering ability. This model also conveys that specific concrete words are recalled better because they use images and logogens, whereas abstract words are not as easily recalled well because they only use logogens, hence showing the difference in thresholds between these two types of words. At the time of its conception, Morton's logogen model was one of the most influential models in springing up other parallel word access models and served as the essential basis for these subsequent models. Morton's model also strongly influenced other contemporary theories on lexical access. However, despite the advantages that the logogen theory presents, it also displays some negative facets. First and foremost, the logogen model does not explain all occurrences in language, such as the introduction of new words or non-words into a persons lexicon. Also, because of the distinctive model application, it may vary in its effectiveness in different languages.  Criticisms  While this model does a reasonable job of understanding the underlying semantics of many aspects in psycholinguistics, there are some flaws that have been pointed out in the logogen model. It has been argued that the prior stimulus patterns that have been seen in the logogen theory are not centrally localized in the logogen itself but are actually distributed throughout the different pathways over which the stimulus is being processed. What this directs at is that the notion and proliferation of logogens was due to modality. In essence, the logogen is unnecessary in the idea of attaining the title of being a recognition unit because of the variety of pathways that it is open to, not just logogens. Another criticism has been that this model essentially ignores larger and more critical structures in language and phonetics such as the different syntactic rules or grammatical construction that innately exists in language. Since this model overtly limits itself to the scope of lexical access then this model is seen as biased and misunderstood. To many psychologists, the logogen model does not meet the functional or representational adequacy that a theory should include to sufficiently comprehend language. Also, another criticism is that the logogen theory was supposed to predict that stimulus degradation should affect priming and word frequency in humans. However, many psychologists have conducted studies and researched the model to show that only priming and not word frequency is interacted with stimulus degradation. Priming is supposed to deteriorate a stimulus because it postulates that the semantic characteristics of previously known words are fed back into the detector of a person which in turn raises the threshold of related items. In word frequency, stimulus degradation is supposed to occur because it postulates that familiar words have lower thresholds than their low-frequency counterparts. However, in studies, priming is the only structure that does show observable and notable stimulus decadence. Even though the logogen theory has many unfilled holes, Morton was a revolutionary of his field whose speculation and research has opened up a remarkable era of psycholinguistics.  Other models to consider  * cohort modelThis model was proposed by Marslen-Wilson and was designed specifically to account for auditory word recognition. It works by breaking the word down and states that when a word is heard all words that begin with the first sound of the target word are activated. This set of words is considered the cohort. Once the first cohort has been activated, the other information, or sounds in the word narrow down the choices. The person recognizes the word when you are left with a single choice; this is considered the \\"recognition point\\". * checking modelThis model was developed by Norris in 1986. In this particular model, he took the approach that any word that partially matches the input is analyzed and checked to see if it fits with the context of the situation. * interactive-activation modelThis model is considered a connectionist model. Proposed by McClelland and Rumelhart in the 1981 to 1982 period, it is based around nodes, which are visual features, and positions of letters within a given word. They also act as word detectors which have inhibitory and excitatory connections between them. This model starts with first letter and suggests that all the words with that first letter are activated at first and then going through the word one can determine what the word is they are looking at. The main principle is that mental phenomena can be described by interconnected networks of simple units. * verification modelThe model was developed by Curtis Becker in 1970. The main idea is that a small number of candidates that are activated in parallel are subject to a serial-verification process. This model starts the word- recognition process with a basic representation of the stimulus. Then, sensory trace, consisting of line features is used to activate word detectors. When an acceptable number of detectors are activated these are used to generate a search set. These items are drawn from the lexicon on the basis of similarity to the sensory trace, which help with the identity of the stimulus. Then, in a serial process the candidates are compared to the representation of the sensory-trace input.  Related concepts  * word frequencyThis is the belief that the speed and accuracy with which a word is recognized is related to how frequently the word occurs in our language. Each logogen has a threshold (for identification) and words with higher frequencies have lower thresholds. Words with higher frequencies also require less sensory evidence. (Morrison & Ellis, 1995) * age of acquisitionThis term generally refers to the age at which a concept or skills is learned. The most studied however, is language acquisition. Words that are learned earlier in life are more quickly recognized and used more frequently than those learned later. This is the reason many hypothesize that children are better at learning a second language than adults (Morrison & Ellis, 2005). There are various hypotheses for why this is so. One is the \\"phonological completeness hypothesis\\" proposed by Brown and Watson in 1989. This states that the reason earlier words are learned quicker is because they are stored holistically. Later in life, new words are stored in fragments. They are recalled slowly because the fragments most be placed together. * repetition primingNon-conscious form of memory in which neural activity is reduced once exposure has occurred repeatedly. A more recognizable word will result in a quicker-response time. See also  References  * Eimas, Peter; Miller, Joanne (1983). Perspectives on the Study of Speech.

The most common variety is played with the flutist holding the s√°o transversely to the right side with his or her mouth placed at the blowing hole. Other varieties include the S√°o D·ªçc, a kind of recorder similar to the Thai Khlui, the S√°o B·∫ßu, and the S√°o √¥i, a recorder played by the Muong people. The s√°o is usually performed solo or in an ensemble among other instruments in orchestras of Vietnamese popular opera Ch√®o, Van singing genre, and Royal Small Orchestra.  Construction and materials  Most frequently made from a single piece of bamboo, the s√°o measures between 40 and 55 centimeters in length and 1.5 to 2 centimeters in diameter, with six or ten finger holes and a tuning slide. Located inside the bamboo tube, near the oval blowing hole, is a soft wooden piece that adjust pitches when necessary. The first hole after the blowing hole is 12 centimeters away, while the other holes continue at a distance of 1 centimeter apart. At the other end of the flute, there is a non-covering hole called definite pitch hole, making it easier for the listener to discern pitch. The simple construction of the holes allow for very complex techniques in playing the instrument such as the use of breath with changes in the blowing angle for great or minute changes in sound quality, or partial-holding of finger holes to make delicate pitch changes. In the past, some flutes had a membrane similar to those on the Chinese Dizi, but these are not used anymore.  Cultural uses and renovations  The s√°o contains the musical spirit of Vietnamese countryside and its four peaceful seasons. In Vietnam, the people played s√°o when resting on the fields or before going to sleep at night. By the end of the 1970s, artists ƒêinh Th√¨n and Ngo Nam modernized the s√°o by making this 6-finger-hole flute into 10-finger-hole flute, extending its register. Examples of the difference between the two variations of the flute can be heard in ƒêinh Th√¨n's \\"Ti·∫øng g·ªçi m√πa xu√¢n\\" and M√£o M√®o's performance of \\"t√¨nh x∆∞a nghƒ©a c≈©\\".

Al-Idrisi worked on the commentaries and illustrations of the map for fifteen years at the court of the Norman King Roger II of Sicily, who commissioned the work around 1138. The map was utilised by various explorers such as Christopher Columbus and Vasco Da Gama for their voyages in America and India.Houben, 2002, pp. 102‚Äì104.Harley & Woodward, 1992, pp. 156‚Äì161. Description Al-Idrisi's world map from 'Ali ibn Hasan al-Hufi al- Qasimi's 1456 copy. According to the French National Library, \\"Ten copies of the Kitab Rujar or Tabula Rogeriana exist worldwide today. Of these ten, six contain at the start of the work a circular map of the world which is not mentioned in the text of al-Idris\\". The original text dates to 1154. Note that south is at the top of the map, so Europe is at the bottom. Bodleian Library, Oxford. The book, written in Arabic, is divided into seven climate zones (in keeping with the established Ptolemaic system), each of which is sub-divided into ten sections, and contains maps showing the Eurasian continent in its entirety, but only the northern part of the African continent. The map is oriented with the North at the bottom. It remained the most accurate world map for the next three centuries. The text incorporates exhaustive descriptions of the physical, cultural, political and socioeconomic conditions of each region and each of the seventy sections has a corresponding map.Bacharach, 2006, p. 140. To produce the work, al-Idrisi interviewed experienced travelers individually and in groups on their knowledge of the world and compiled \\"only that part... on which there was complete agreement and seemed credible, excluding what was contradictory.\\" Roger II had his map engraved on a silver disc weighing about 300 pounds. It showed, in al-Idrisi's words, \\"the seven climatic regions, with their respective countries and districts, coasts and lands, gulfs and seas, watercourses and river mouths.\\" Al-Idrisi settled in Palermo, Sicily, at the tolerant and enlightened court of the Norman king Roger II of Sicily, where he was charged with the production of a book on geography. It was to contain all available data on the location and climate of the world‚Äôs main centers of population. King Roger himself enthusiastically interviewed travelers passing through his kingdom, and agents and draftsmen were dispatched to gather material‚Äîa research process that took some 15 years. In 1154, just a few weeks before the king died, al-Idrisi‚Äôs book was finally complete. Written in Arabic and Latin and accompanied by maps, it presented the world as a sphere. It calculated the circumference to be 37,000 kilometres (22,900 mi) ‚Äî an error of less than 10 percent ‚Äî and it hinted at the concept of gravity. Following the classical Greek tradition, al-Idrisi had divided the world into seven climate zones and described each in turn, supported by 70 longitudinal section maps which, when put together, made a rectangular map of the known world. This was complemented by a smaller, circular world map in which the south was drawn at the top and Arabia, being the site of Mecca, was depicted centrally. Al-Idrisi‚Äôs book came to be known as Kitab Rujar (Roger‚Äôs Book) and the circular world map was engraved onto a silver tablet. Sadly, both the book and the silver map appear to have been destroyed during civil unrest shortly afterward, in 1160. Thus our understanding today of al-Idrisi‚Äôs conclusions is based on an abbreviated version of a second book that he wrote for Roger‚Äôs son, William II. Manuscripts of this so-called ‚ÄúLittle Idrisi‚Äù are held today in a handful of European libraries.\\"Parry, James V. 2004. \\"Mapping Arabia.\\" Saudi Aramco World. January/February 2004.

Tibet currently has the highest incidence rate of KBD in China. Southeast Siberia and North Korea are other affected areas. KBD usually involves children ages 5‚Äì15. To date, more than a million individuals have suffered from KBD. The symptoms of KBD include joint pain, morning stiffness in the joints, disturbances of flexion and extension in the elbows, enlarged inter-phalangeal joints, and limited motion in many joints of the body. Death of cartilage cells in the growth plate and articular surface is the basic pathologic feature; this can result in growth retardation and secondary osteoarthrosis. Histological diagnosis of KBD is particularly difficult; clinical and radiological examinations have proved to be the best means for identifying KBD. Little is known about the early stages of KBD before the visible appearance of the disease becomes evident in the destruction of the joints. This disease has been recognized for over 150 years but its cause has not yet been completely defined. Currently, the accepted potential causes of KBD include mycotoxins present in grain, trace mineral deficiency in nutrition, and high levels of fulvic acid in drinking water. Selenium and iodine have been considered the major deficiencies associated with KBD. Mycotoxins produced by fungi can contaminate grain, which may cause KBD because mycotoxins cause the production of free radicals. T-2 is the mycotoxin implicated with KBD, produced by members of several fungal genera. T-2 toxin can cause lesions in hematopoietic, lymphoid, gastrointestinal, and cartilage tissues, especially in physeal cartilage. Fulvic acid present in drinking water damages cartilage cells. Selenium supplementation in selenium deficient areas has been shown to prevent this disease. However, selenium supplementation in some areas showed no significant effect, meaning that deficiency of selenium may not be the dominant cause in KBD. Recently a significant association between SNP rs6910140 of COL9A1 and Kashin‚ÄìBeck disease was discovered genetically, suggesting a role of COL9A1 in the development of Kashin‚ÄìBeck disease. Cause The cause of KBD remains controversial. Studies of the pathogenesis and risk factors of KBD have proposed selenium deficiency, inorganic (e.g. manganese, phosphate) and organic matter (humic and fulvic acids) in drinking water, and fungi on self- produced storage grain (Alternaria sp., Fusarium sp.) producing trichotecene (T2) mycotoxins. Most authors accept that the cause of KBD is multifactorial, selenium deficiency being the underlying factor that predisposes the target cells (chondrocytes) to oxidative stress from free-radical carriers, such as mycotoxins in storage grain and fulvic acid in drinking water. In Tibet, epidemiological studies carried out in 1995‚Äì1996 by MSF and coll. showed that KBD was associated with iodine deficiency and with fungal contamination of barley grains by Alternaria sp., Trichotecium sp., Cladosporium sp. and Drechslera sp. Indications existed as well with respect to the role of organic matters in drinking water. A severe selenium deficiency was documented as well, but selenium status was not associated with the disease, suggesting that selenium deficiency alone could not explain the occurrence of KBD in the villages under study. An association with the gene Peroxisome Proliferator- Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1 Beta (PPARGC1B) has been reported.Wen Y, Hao J, Xiao X, Wang W, Guo X, Lin W, Yang T, Liu X, Shen H, Tan L, Chen X, Tian Q, Deng HW, Zhang F (2016) PARGC1B gene is associated with Kashin-Beck disease in Han Chinese. Funct Integr Genomics This gene is a transcription factor and mutations in this gene would be expected to affect several other genes. Prevention  Prevention of Kashin‚ÄìBeck disease has a long history. Intervention strategies were mostly based on one of the three major theories of its cause. Selenium supplementation, with or without additional antioxidant therapy (vitamin E and vitamin C) has been reported to be successful, but in other studies no significant decrease could be shown compared to a control group. Major drawbacks of selenium supplementation are logistic difficulties (including daily or weekly intake and drug supply), potential toxicity (in case of less well-controlled supplementation strategies), associated iodine deficiency (that should be corrected before selenium supplementation to prevent further deterioration of thyroid status) and low compliance. The latter was certainly the case in Tibet, where selenium supplementation has been implemented from 1987 to 1994 in areas of high endemicity. With the mycotoxin theory in mind, backing of grains before storage was proposed in Guangxi province, but results are not reported in international literature. Changing from grain source has been reported to be effective in Heilongjiang Province and North Korea. With respect to the role of drinking water, changing of water sources to deep well water has been reported to decrease the X-ray metaphyseal detection rate in different settings. In general, the effect of preventive measures however remains controversial, due to methodological problems (no randomised controlled trials), lack of documentation, or, as discussed above, inconsistency of results. Treatment Treatment of KBD is palliative. Surgical corrections have been made with success by Chinese and Russian orthopedists. By the end of 1992, M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res‚ÄîBelgium started a physical therapy programme aiming at alleviating the symptoms of KBD patients with advanced joint impairment and pain (mainly adults), in Nyemo county, Lhasa prefecture. Physical therapy had significant effects on joint mobility and joint pain in KBD patients. Later on (1994‚Äì1996), the programme has been extended to several other counties and prefectures in Tibet. Epidemiology  Kashin‚ÄìBeck disease occurrence is limited to 13 provinces and two autonomous regions of China. It has also been reported in Siberia and North Korea, but incidence in these regions is reported to have decreased with socio-economic development. In China, KBD is estimated to affect some 2 million to 3 million people across China, and 30 million are living in endemic areas. Life expectancy in KBD regions has been reported to be significantly decreased in relation to selenium deficiency and Keshan disease (endemic juvenile dilative cardiomyopathia). The prevalence of KBD in Tibet varies strongly from valley to valley, and village to village. Prevalence of clinical symptoms suggestive of KBD reaches 100% in 5- to 15-year-old children in at least one village. Prevalence rates of over 50% are not uncommon. A clinical prevalence survey carried out in Lhasa prefecture yielded a figure of 11.4% for a study population of approximately 50,000 inhabitants. As in other regions of China, farmers are by far the most affected population group. Eponymy The condition was named after Russian military physicians Evgeny Vladimirovich Bek (1865‚Äì1915) and Nicolai Ivanowich Kashin (1825‚Äì1872). Because of varied transliteration from Cyrillic script into the Latin script of both German orthography and English orthography, the disease name has been spelled variously as Kashin‚ÄìBeck disease, Kashin-Bek disease, and Kaschin-Beck disease. The noneponymous names endemic osteoarthritis, osteoarthritis deformans endemica, and osteoarthritis deformans have also been used.

The Ottoman army broke into Zachlumia, the kingdom's southern region. After days of looting, the invaders clashed with the defending force near the town of Bileƒáa, ending in the latter's decisive victory.  Background  The Ottoman Turks, based in Thrace, appeared as a considerable military and political factor for the western Balkans in the 1380s. Having turned rulers of various countries in Macedonia into their vassals, the Ottomans under Murad I started launching raids to the west, towards the Adriatic coast. They eagerly assisted feudal lords in the Balkans in their wars among themselves, increasing and exploiting discord and purposely weakening Balkan states. The Kingdom of Bosnia was thought far enough to be safe from an Ottoman incursion and in the east it was shielded by a belt of independent states that rose after the fall of the Serbian Empire. The distance between Bosnia and Ottoman Thrace proved no barrier, however. The hostility between King Tvrtko I of Bosnia and ƒêuraƒë II Bal≈°iƒá, ruler of Zeta (one of the Serbian statelets) and vassal of Murad, led to clashes between Bosnians and Turks earlier than would have been expected. The first Ottoman incursion into Bosnia, about which little is known, took place in October 1386. It was likely suggested and enabled by ƒêuraƒë, and caused panic in the neighbouring Republic of Ragusa. In 1388 ƒêuraƒë contacted the Ottoman commander Lala ≈ûahin Pasha, then waging war in Epirus, hoping to slight Tvrtko.  Ottoman attack  The threat of an Ottoman attack on Bosnia appeared in early August 1388. The Ottoman ruler Murad I had dispatched Lala ≈ûahin Pasha to assist ƒêuraƒë. Ragusan authorities sent an emissary to ƒêuraƒë concerning Turks who had broken into Zachlumia, in the south of Tvrtko's realm and very close to the Ragusa itself. On 15 August, the Ragusans decided to provide refuge in their state for Tvrtko's subjects who were fleeing the advancing invaders, allowing the noblemen and the common people to take shelter in the city of Dubrovnik and the Pelje≈°ac peninsula around the city of Ston respectively. The walls of Ston were prepared for defense; on 19 August all the inhabitants were tasked with defending the peninsula, and the following day Tvrtko too sent 1,000 men to help the defenders. An emissary was also sent that day to Lala ≈ûahin Pasha, who was already nearby. The Ragusans were intent on securing themselves in face of the imminent clash, and the emissary sent to the Ottoman commander was probably meant to both negotiate and provide intelligence. On 22 August advice was sought from the Hungarian court as well. The size of the army dispatched by Murad against Tvrtko is not known, but it must have been considerable since it included his own sons. It was certainly not a vast, conquering one, but neither was it a small and merely looting band. Its goal was to bring plunder as well as to showcase Murad's military might. King Tvrtko's army, led by his most capable and trusted general, Grand Duke of Bosnia, Vlatko Vukoviƒá, allowed the Turks to penetrate as far as the town of Bileƒáa. The Bosnians engaged the invaders in Zachlumian gorges and decisively defeated them. Lala ≈ûahin Pasha barely escaped with his life; few of his men were as lucky. The precise date is disputed; according to a later chronicle of the events, the battle took place on 27 August. Already on 26 August, however, Ragusans informed King Sigismund of Hungary of the outcome and decided to release the captured Zetans and Albanians, who had been in the Ottoman army.  Aftermath  The Ottoman attack and defeat made both Tvrtko and ƒêuraƒë more willing to come to terms with each other. The Bosnian victory did not overshadow the effects of Ottoman plundering. While future incursions remained a possibility, the Bosnians did not face the Ottoman army again for almost a year following the victory in Bileƒáa. In June 1389, however, Murad himself marched westwards, perhaps intending to eventually strike against Tvrtko. Murad might have also suspected that Lazar, ruler of Moravian Serbia, contributed to the defeat near Bileƒáa. This forced Bosnians and Serbians to band together against his army at the Battle of Kosovo.

Reiter Engineering GmbH & Co Kg is a German racing team founded in 1994. The company is named after engineer and founder Hans Reiter. In 2000, Reiter entered a Lamborghini in the FIA GT Championship with its own Diablo GT built by the team. In 2003 the Diablo GT was replaced by the newer Lamborghini Murci√©lago R-GT, with increased development from Audi Sport, before also becoming the constructor of the Gallardo and Camaro GT3s for the FIA GT3 European Championship and later the ADAC GT Masters. Besides running the factory squads in their respective championships Reiter also builds and sells its cars to other teams for various uses. Currently Reiter Engineering produces the KTM X-Bow GT4, the Lamborghini Gallardo Reiter Extenso R-EX and the SaReNi Camaro GT3. In 2016 Hans Reiter launched his latest concept Reiter Young Stars a championship designed to help propel the futures of young drivers and engineers hoping to climb the motorsports ladder. Racing history FIA GT In 2000, Reiter debuted its custom-built Diablo GT in the international FIA GT Championship, with backing from Lamborghini. The car was a variant of the Diablo GTRs used in the Lamborghini Supertrophy one-make series, adapted to better compete in FIA GT. Following a short 2000 season, Reiter managed to score their first points in 2001 with a fifth-place finish in the season finale. A points-scoring finish would not come again for the Diablo GT until it was replaced by the newer Murci√©lago R-GT at the end of 2003. This new car would earn points on its debut in 2004, with a third place at Valencia. The following year, Reiter managed another point at its home round in Oschersleben. Reiter's Murci√©lago leading a Zakspeed Saleen S7-R at Oschersleben. Reiter managed to score sponsorship funding in 2006, leading to the team name being changed to B-Racing RS-Line Team early in the season and the ability to run two cars, before changing to become All-Inkl.com Racing halfway through the year. The team managed three points-scoring finishes, with a best result of sixth in Brno. 2007 saw Reiter's greatest success as the team opened the year with their first victory, drivers Christophe Bouchut and Stefan M√ºcke winning in Zhuhai. The two-car team managed to score points in six out of ten races that season, allowing the All-Inkl.com Racing squad to earn seventh in the Teams' Championship and Reiter Engineering tying for ninth. FIA GT3 In 2006, the new FIA GT3 European Championship was launched. Reiter was developing and selling the smaller Lamborghini Gallardo for use in the new series. Reiter itself would run a three-car team, alongside customer team S-Berg Racing. The team managed a best finish of third at Mugello, and going on to finish eighth in the Team's Championship. Reiter driver Albert von Thurn und Taxis won the Lamborghini Manufacturers' Cup as well. ADAC GT Masters Following Reiter's success in FIA GT3, the team chose to move their Gallardos to the new ADAC GT Masters series in Germany. Using the same formula as FIA GT3, Reiter was able to improve on their results from the previous year. The team managed nine victories in the twelve race season, handily winning the Teams' Championship and winning the Drivers' Championship for Christopher Haase. Racing cars Since 2000, Reiter Engineering has been the main constructor of racing cars for Lamborghini. In that time, they have built and sold several different racing variants of Lamborghini models. Lamborghini Diablo GT Reiter's first car manufactured within the team, the Diablo GT was an attempt to bring Lamborghini's motorsports presence to the international stage, by adapting the supercar to comply with FIA GT regulations. Although other teams had previously attempted to adapt Diablo GTRs from the Lamborghini Supertrophy, the Diablo GT would be built just for FIA GT, allowing it to gain some performance advantages over its mass-produced siblings. The car retained several elements of the GTRs, including the lack of a four-wheel drive system. Lamborghini Murci√©lago R-GT The Lamborghini Murci√©lago R-GT is a racing version of the Murci√©lago, built by Reiter Engineering with development aid from Audi Sport. The R-GTs have been modified from their production versions, most notably by removing the four-wheel drive system to comply with FIA, ACO, and JAF regulations. The R-GT retains the standard Murci√©lago V12, but has air restrictors to manage the power output. Murci√©lago R-GTs have been used by customer teams such as the Japanese Lamborghini Owners Club in the Super GT championship and 24 Hours of Le Mans, DAMS in the FIA GT Championship, and Krohn-Barbour in the American Le Mans Series. Lamborghini Murci√©lago LP670 R-SV A Murci√©lago LP670 R-SV The Lamborghini Murci√©lago LP670 R-SV is a racing version of the Murci√©lago LP670 Super Veloce. Like its predecessor the Murci√©lago R-GT, the LP670 R-SV has been modified by Reiter Engineering to comply with FIA regulations. The R-SV was mainly built to run in the FIA GT1 World Championship. Lamborghini Gallardo GT3 The Lamborghini Gallardo GT3 is a racing version of the production Gallardo, adapted to comply with the FIA's GT3 class category. Once again, the car's four-wheel drive system has been removed, and modifications made elsewhere to adapt the car for safety and performance. Due to the car complying with GT3 regulations, it is able to race in a variety of national series as well as to run in the FIA GT3 European Championship. Several teams currently use the Gallardo GT3 in a multitude of championships. A total of 49 Gallardo GT3's have been built and are active worldwide. In 2009 the Macau Grand Prix was won by a Reiter Gallardo GT3. Lamborghini Gallardo GT2 The Lamborghini Gallardo GT2 is a racing version of the freshly revised production Gallardo LP560-4, adapted to comply with the ACO's GT2 class category. Once again, the car's four-wheel drive system has been removed, and modifications made elsewhere to adapt the car for safety and performance. Due to the car complying with GT2 regulations, it is able to race in a variety of national series as well as to run in the Le Mans Series, FIA GT Championship, and the American Le Mans Series. The Gallardo GT2 is currently undergoing testing before racing the full 2009 Le Mans Series season. Lamborghini Gallardo LP560 GT3 The Lamborghini Gallardo LP560 GT3 is a racing version of the production Gallardo adapted to comply with the FIA's GT3 class category. Equal to its predecessor, the car's four-wheel drive system has been removed, and modifications made elsewhere to adapt the car for safety and performance. A lot of Murci√©lago's race know-how, and much more compared to the (old) Gallardo GT3 has been implemented into the LP560 GT3.  KTM X-BOW GT4  A KTM X-BOW GT4 The KTM X-BOW GT4 is a joint venture between Reiter Engineering and KTM Sportscars. The car first went into production in 2015 and is known to be the upgrade of the original KTM X-Bow. The car is the first Closed cockpit (GT) race car in the KTM Sportscar fleet. The car weighs a mere 999 kg and has a 360 hp Audi 2.0L TFSI engine onboard. It is suitable for all GT4 championships world wide and is a fitting trackday car for car enthusiasts.

She was the sister ship of the San Antonio and the San Bernard. In 1840, San Jacinto was part of the Texas Navy flotilla led by Commodore Edwin Ward Moore which was dispatched to assist Yucatecan rebels that had taken up arms against Mexico. In a storm, San Jacinto ran aground at Cayos Arcas and was wrecked. The crew were rescued by the flagship Austin. Background of the Texas Navy The Texas Navy was officially formed in January 1836, with the purchase of four schooners: Invincible, Brutus, Independence, and Liberty. These ships, under the command of Commodore Charles Hawkins, helped Texas win independence by preventing a Mexican blockade of the Texas coast, seizing Mexican ships carrying reinforcements and supplies to its army, and sending their cargoes to the Texas volunteer army. Nevertheless, Mexico refused to recognize Texas as an independent country. By the middle of 1837, all of the ships had been lost at sea, run aground, captured, or sold. With no ships to impede a possible invasion by Mexico, Texas was vulnerable to attack. In 1838, President Mirabeau B. Lamar responded to this threat by forming a second Texas Navy. Unlike Sam Houston, Lamar was an ardent supporter of the Texas Navy and saw the urgent need for its continuation. The second Texas Navy was placed under the command of Commodore Edwin Ward Moore, an Alexandria Academy graduate who was recruited from the United States Navy. One of the ships of this second navy was the San Jacinto along with her sister ships, the San Antonio and San Bernard. History of the San Jacinto Pennant of the San Jacinto Originally built as one of the Baltimore clippers at the Schott and Whitney shipyard in Baltimore, Maryland and called Viper, she was one of the smallest of a class of schooners and brigs built specifically for the slave trade between 1820 and 1850. A group of six schooners, including La Amistad was built in Baltimore around 1836. They were identified as being \\"Purposely built and fitted out for use in the slave trade by the United States Consul General in Havana\\", and Viper was typical of the class. Blockade duty and wreck On 26 June 1840, the San Jacinto sailed from Galveston with instructions to blockade the Mexican port of Veracruz and seize enemy ships. On 20 August, the San Jacinto rejoined Commodore Edwin W. Moore's flotilla and remained with them until being detached to Galveston with dispatches for the government. In search of drinking water, the San Jacinto called at Cayos Arcas. A violent cold front approached but Lt. O'Shaunessy nevertheless went ashore, leaving Lt. Alfred G. Gray as senior officer on board. When the ship's anchor failed to hold, Gray displayed great ingenuity and seamanship in an attempt to save it, but even a piece of the ship's artillery used as an additional anchor could not save the San Jacinto from being swept ashore by gale winds. The survivors of The San Jacinto were rescued by the Austin on 31 October 1840 and the ship was declared a loss. Commanders of the vessel The San Jacinto was commanded by: * Captain John T. K. Lothrop, June‚ÄîNovember 1839 * Lt. James E. Gibbons, February‚ÄîApril 1840 * Lt. Alexander Moore, April‚ÄîMay 1840 * Lt. William R. Postell, May‚ÄîSeptember 1840, * Lt.

Attributed to William Scrots. William (or Guillim) Scrots (or Scrotes or Stretes; active 1537‚Äì1553)Getty Union Name List was a painter of the Tudor court and an exponent of the Mannerist style of painting in the Netherlands.Gaunt, 27. Biography Scrots is first heard of when appointed a court painter to Mary of Habsburg, Regent of the Netherlands, in 1537.Rothenstein, 24. In England, he followed Hans Holbein as King's Painter to Henry VIII in 1546, with a substantial annual salary of ¬£62 10s,Gaunt, 28. over twice as much as Holbein's thirty pounds a year.Richard Gay in T Kren & S McKendrick (eds), Illuminating the Renaissance: The Triumph of Flemish Manuscript Painting in Europe, p. 434, Getty Museum/Royal Academy of Arts, 2003, He continued in this role during the reign of the boy king Edward VI. His salary was stopped on Edward's death in 1553, after which it is not known what became of him, though it is presumed he left England.Gaunt, 29. Strong 1969 says that Scrots \\"presumably\\" died between September 1553 and September 1554 (p. 69) Hampton Court. Anamorphic portrait of Edward VI, 1546. Little more is known of Scrots other than that his paintings showed an interest in ingenious techniques and detailed accessories. Scrots was paid 50 marks in 1551 for three \\"great tables\\", two of which were portraits of Edward delivered to the ambassadors Thomas Hoby and John Mason as gifts for foreign monarchs, and the third a \\"picture of the late earle of Surrey attainted.\\"Karen Hearn, Dynasties, p. 52: Strype, John, Ecclesiastical Memorials, vol. 2 pt. 2, Oxford (1822), 217. Two full-length portraits of Edward VI in a pose similar to that of Holbein's portrait of his father, one now in the Royal Collection (left) and another now in the Louvre (below), are attributed to Scrots and are likely to be these two paintings.Strong, English Icon, 1969, p. 71Art historian William Gaunt assumes that this painting is by Scrots. Gaunt, 28. Scrots also painted an anamorphic profile of Edward VI, distorted so that it is impossible to view it normally except from a special angle to the side. This optical trick is similar to that used by Holbein in his painting The Ambassadors and in contemporary portraits of Francis I and Ferdinand I. Later, when the painting was exhibited at Whitehall Palace in the winter of 1591‚Äì92, it created a sensation, and important visitors were all taken to see it.Lukacher, 74. Assessment In the words of art historian Ellis Waterhouse, \\"although Scrots was not a painter of high creative or imaginative gifts, he knew all the latest fashions, and a series of paintings appeared at the English court during the next few years which could vie in modernity with those produced anywhere in northern Europe\\".Quoted by Lukacher, 74. In particular, Scrots seems to have helped popularise the full-length portrait at the same time as it became fashionable on the continent.Rothenstein, 24. Scrots's portrait of Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, takes a strikingly different approach to portraiture from that previously adopted by Holbein and other painters in England.The status of the portrait is the subject of debate, although it is clear there was a portrait of Howard by Scrots. Four versions exist, of which the one illustrated, still owned by Howard's descendants at Arundel Castle, is agreed to be the oldest, and the only one that could be original. The original is documented as a \\"table\\", which Mary Edmond (in Grove) takes to mean a panel painting, although Hearn says the term can be used for a painting on canvas, such as the Arundel version. Some historians consider that the rounded tops of the shields betray the painting as a later copy, since such shields were painted with flat tops in the Tudor period, but Hearn illustrates a French engraving of 1540 which may have been the inspiration for the frame and which features round-topped shields. See the arguments for the dating of the painting in William Sessions's biography of Howard, 341, and discussion of the French engraving in Hearn, p. 52 This, especially in the enframing architectural statuary, is in the Mannerist style that had originated in Florence and then spread to the France of Francis I and to the Netherlands. It exhibits the elongation of the figure typical of the style.Gaunt, 27. The artist depicts the earl dressed in fantastically ornamented clothing and surrounds him with architectural details and emblems from classical sculpture. These may relate to the only large-scale Mannerist project in England, then nearing completion, Nonsuch Palace in Surrey. The painting set a new fashion for English portraiture.Williams, 228. The earl was executed in 1547 on suspicion of treason; some (indeed most) of the evidence brought against him was that he had made inappropriate use of the Royal Arms of England, as indeed he does here. He was of royal descent, but these were not his personal arms. A heraldic drawing was produced in evidence, but this painting does not seem to have been mentioned at his trial.\\"The dangers of heraldry\\" ‚Äì third item down A three-quarter length painting of Edward as Prince of Wales with Hunsdon House, Hertfordshire,Hunsdon originated as a mid-fifteenth-century moated tower house, which was altered for Henry VIII (1527‚Äì34). Later, Queen Elizabeth granted the house to her cousin Sir Henry Carey (1558/59) and the house was subsequently altered. (Hunsdon House). in the background and the famous portrait of Elizabeth I as princess (illustration), both dated to 1546, have been long suggested as undocumented works by Scrots, but art historians have recently questioned that attribution.Dendrochronology suggests that the panels on which these two portraits are painted may have come from the same tree; see Karen Hearn, Dynasties, p.47-48 Both paintings are in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle.

She gave birth to a child as a single woman in Sokoto, a Nigerian state under Sharia law. She was sentenced to be stoned, but was acquitted of all charges in March 2002 after a retrial. Background Hussaini was sentenced to death by stoning in October 2001 for allegedly having a child with a married neighbour. She had the child after her divorce. Hussaini claimed that she was the victim of repeated rape by a man, whom the Sharia court found not guilty due to lack of evidence. During the trial, Hussaini had no legal representation and was not informed of her legal rights.INSIDE AFRICA The Sokoto court dismissed her testimony and convicted her on 12 October 2001. The verdict was widely condemned and international campaigns and petitions to release her were launched. Halima Abdullahi, director of Help Eliminate Loneliness and Poverty (HELP), a non-governmental organisation, also criticized the verdict. In a statement she said the verdict was a \\"thorough embarrassment‚Äù to the majority of Nigerian Muslims. The group argued that the judgment was wrong because Safiya was accused of adultery instead of fornication, since she was a divorcee. Also, the four witnesses stipulated by the Islamic law were not available at the trial. Halima claimed that the verdict was passed because Safiya came from an underprivileged class. While describing the verdict as ‚Äúgender discrimination of the highest order,‚Äù the group called on Governor Attahiru Bafarawa to intervene to save Safiya‚Äôs life.Lawyers, non - governmental organisations protest sharia court death sentence on a pregnant divorcee and mother of four Hussaini appealed, her lawyers arguing that Hussaini's former husband was the father of her one-year- old daughter Adama and that the village woman had made her original statement under duress.Nigerian Woman Avoids Stoning Death Further they argued that the alleged act of adultery had taken place before sharia law was implemented in the state.

Most Hondurans live in Honduras, although there is also a significant Honduran diaspora, particularly in the United States, Spain, and many smaller communities in other countries around the world. There are also people living in Honduras who are not Hondurans, because they were not born or raised in Honduras, nor have they yet gained citizenship. Catracho Latin Americans refer to a person from Honduras as a '. The term was coined by Nicaraguans in the mid-19th century when Honduran General Florencio Xatruch returned from battle with his Honduras and El Salvador soldiers after defeating American freebooters commanded by William Walker, whose purpose was to re-establish slavery and take over all of Central America. As the general and his soldiers returned, some Nicaraguans yelled out ', meaning \\"Here come Xatruch's boys!\\" However, Nicaraguans had so much trouble pronouncing the general's Catalan last name that they altered the phrase to ' and ultimately settled on '. Salvadorans fought side by side with their Honduran Central American brothers, against William Walker's troops.  History  left Before the conquest, \\"Honduras was inhabited by an aboriginal population descended from different ethnic groups.\\" 1 Among these are: Los Lencas, Payas, Chorotegas, Xicaques, Chortis, just to mention a few. All of these groups lacked \\"cultural unity,\\" and \\"probably had a Mesoamerican and South American cultural origin. \\"According to some historians: ¬´These cultures achieved great progress in the various fields of human knowledge, driven by the development of a varied agriculture ... In this way they guaranteed adequate food for their large population. They also applied techniques of great perfection in fabrics and ceramics. They developed an intense and varied trade. ¬ª In the north-western section of Honduras, the peoples of the Chort√≠s, a Mayan group located in Cop√°n and Ocotepeque, and the Lencas that extended through the departments of Santa B√°rbara, Lempira, Intibuc√°, La Paz, Comayagua, Francisco Moraz√°n and Valle predominated. and part of what today comprises the territory of El Salvador. The rest of the Honduran territory was inhabited by peoples from the south of the continent, with a nomadic and semi- nomadic culture, governed by primitive communal production relations. Among these peoples were Tolupanes (also known as \\"xicaques\\"), Pechs (also known as \\"payas\\"), Tawahkas and Misquitos who, as a whole, made up the majority of the country's population. According to the Honduran sociologist, Guillermo Molina Chocano, the first counts of the Honduran population are the product of estimates made by \\"historians, chroniclers, and travelers.\\" Most of these coincide, that upon the arrival of the Spanish, the aboriginal population both in Honduras and the rest of America was very numerous. For example, the Milanese traveler, Girolaneo Benzoni (Historia del Nuevo Mundo, 1572) assures that \\"When the Spanish went to conquer the region of Honduras ... they encountered more than four hundred thousand Indians ...\\" 1 Others (El Costo de la Conquista, 1992) claim that \\"the aboriginal population of Honduras was approximately 800,000 indigenous people. Demographics Considering metropolitan areas only, the Honduran capital is the fourth largest Central American urban agglomeration, after Guatemala City, Managua, and San Salvador. Population In the 2017 Honduras has a population of more than 9 million people. Honduras had a population of 7.4 million according to Honduras' 2001 Census of Population, the most populous Departments are: Cort√©s (1.2 million), Francisco Moraz√°n (1.2 million), Yoro (466,000), Olancho (420,000), Choluteca (391,000) siguatepeque and Comayagua (353,000). The least populous are Islas de la Bahia and Gracias a Dios. According to the same source, the main cities are: Tegucigalpa (894,000-Central District only), San Pedro Sula (517,000), Choloma (160,000), La Ceiba (140,000), El Progreso (106,000), Choluteca, Comayagua, Puerto Cort√©s, La Lima and Danl√≠. However, the main metropolitan areas are Tegucigalpa (1,200,000-est. 2007-) and San Pedro Sula (900,000). Between the 1988 and 2001 Census, San Pedro Sula's population doubled. The country has 20 cities with more than 20,000 inhabitants. Ethnic groups  Mestizos  The majority of the Honduran population is mestizo (a mixture of Spaniards and Amerindian), thjese people descent form inmigrants from Spain and Amerindian people like the Lencas and Mayans. According studies the mestizo population makes the 85% of the total population of Honduras. According some census the mestizo population of Honduras is made up of 58,4% European, 36,2% Amerindian, and 5,4% African.  Amerindian  The Amerindian population consists of seven indigenous groups recognized by the Confederation of Autochthonous Peoples of Honduras (CONPAH) and the government of Honduras, among them they recognize the Afro-Caribbean and Gar√≠funa groups which are not Amerindian. The seven indigenous groups are: the Ch'orti', a Mayan group living in the northwest on the border with Guatemala; the Garifuna speaking a Carib language., they live along the entire Caribbean coastline of Honduras, and in the Bay Islands; the Pech or Paya Indians living in a small area in the Olancho department; the Tolupan (also called Jicaque, \\"Xicaque\\", or Tol), living in the Department of Yoro and in the reserve of the Monta√±a de la Flor and parts of the department of Yoro; the Lenca Indians living in the western highlands of Intibuca, Lempira, La Paz, Valle and Choluteca departments; and the Miskito Indians living on the northeast coast in the Gracias A Dios department and along the border with Nicaragua.  Whites  Francisco Morazan alt= White Hondurans or white people from Honduras (colloquially called cheles), is a term used to refer to those Hondurans who are cataloged or considered as Caucasian people. However, the term white in Honduras similar to other Latin American countries is quite ambiguous, and some white people would not be classified as such in other countries. The first whites in Honduras came with Columbus in 1502, during the entire 16th century came a huge spaniard migration to Honduras. Whites of Honduran origin are also descended from immigrants who arrived from Europe, such as places like Catalonia, Germany, Italy, East Europe, and the Middle East in the 19th and 20th centuries. Percentages have varied from 1 to 7% due the fact that most white Hondurans identifies and adopts the mestizo identity.  Blacks  Approximately 2.9% of Honduras population is black, or Afro-Honduran, and mainly reside on the country's Caribbean or Atlantic coast. The black population comes from a number of sources. Most are the descendants of the West Indian islands brought to Honduras as slaves. Another large group are the Gar√≠funa, descendants of an Afro-Carib population which revolted against British authorities on the island of St. Vincent and were forcibly moved to Belize and Honduras during the 18th century. Gar√≠funas are part of Honduran identity through theatrical presentations such as Louvavagu. Immigration During the early 20h Century Honduras received a long migration from Europe and the middle east, however most of these Arab and Jewish migrants are considered white in Honduras.  Arabs  TV host Salvador Nasralla, a descendant of palestinian inmigrants. Honduras hosts a significant Arab community (the vast majority of whom are Christian Arabs of Palestinian and Lebanese descent). However, these people are also cataloged as white in Honduras. The Palestinians, Syrian, and Lebanese arrived in the country in the late 19th century and early 20th century, from the otoman empire establishing themselves especially in the city of San Pedro Sula. There are other families that settled in Tegucigalpa, La Ceiba and El Progreso. The Palestinian community, well integrated in Honduras, is prominent in business, commerce, banking, industry, and politics. They are popularly known as turcos (Turks) as they came with Turkish passports, Today Honduras ranks ninth in countries with the highest Arab descent in the world.  Jews  In the case of Honduras, the origin of modern Jews living in the country begins in 1920, between this year and 1940 the majority of Jews who arrived in the country were Ashkenazis of German, Polish, and Romanian origin, most of whom were from Harvest. Jews are also cataloged as white people in Hondurans; most of them came fleeing the growing anti-Semitism in Europe and the Second World War, in 1939 a total of 455 Germans were registered and 95 were Jews The rest are French, Italian and a small number of British people.  Asians  Also present in an East Asian community that is primarily of Chinese descent, and to a lesser extent Japanese, Korean, Ryukyuan, Vietnamese also make up a small percentage due to their arrival to Honduras as contract laborers in the 1980s and 1990s.  Religion   Christianity  alt= Today, Hondurans are primarily Catholic with 46% and Protestants 41%, dividing equally between Protestants and Catholics. Historically, at the beginning of the 20th century, due to the influence of the United States that arrived during this period, Protestants outnumbered the Catholics, representing two-thirds of the country, mainly in the north. With the loss of the Protestant regions after World War II, coupled with the increase in agnosticism and atheism in the eastern region of the country the Protestant population decreased. Today there are rural and urban regions where Protestantism has ceased to predominate.  Indigenous faiths  Today in almost no Hondurans who practice autochthonous polytheistic religions derived from Nahualism, which venerated different deities, however many of the Mayan, Lenca and other native religious customs were mixed with the Catholic tradition, thus creating a syncretism. The vestiges of these ancient religions can be seen in various archaeological sites in the country.  Garifuna religion  The Gar√≠funa religion is the Dug√∫, it is a mixture of African, Catholic, and indigenous beliefs.  Culture  The popular culture of the Honduran people, as in most countries, consists of artistic creations attended by large audiences or shows. Such artistic-cultural exhibitions are held during certain days of the year through very creative celebrations.  Holydays  Our lady of Suyapa. Among the most popular holidays are; on September 15, Honduras' independence day. This commemoration is carried out with parades of schools and colleges throughout the country. Some companies also participate who adorn the parade with floats of any kind. Since the conquest of Honduras, the predominant religion in the country is Catholic, because of this, special interest is given to the Holy Week celebrations. The day of the Virgin of Suyapa is celebrated on February 3 of each year with a great pilgrimage to Tegucigalpa to give it veneration. During the Easter holidays, most of the population takes advantage of this holiday week that begins on Wednesday and ends on Sunday to walk on the beaches and spas of the country, and enjoy the tropical summer that is only enjoyed at this time of year mainly on the North and South Coast of Honduras.  Literature  Literature in Honduras dates back to the Mayan codices, although new literary genres were introduced after the conquest. Among the most notable writers of Honduras are David Fortin, Froyl√°n Turcios, Juan Ram√≥n Molina, Rafael Heliodoro Valle, Antonio Jos√© Rivas, Clementina Su√°rez, Ram√≥n Amaya Amador, Marco Antonio Rosa, Roberto Sosa, Lucila Gamero de Medina, Roberto Quezada, Armando Garc√≠a , Helen Uma√±a, Alberto Destephen, Argentina D√≠az Lozano, Rony Bonilla and Julio Escoto.  Cinema  Cinema in the country has its true beginning in 1962, The first official Honduran filmmaker was Sami Kafati, he studied cinematography in Rome in the 1960s. His first cinematographic work was the experimental short film Mi Amigo √Ångel, produced in 1962, is the first fictional cinematographic work produced in Honduras, according to the Honduran film historian Marxis Lenin Hern√°ndez \\"the film was not so well received in its time, but today it is highly valued.\\" This short film has a great expressive force and a great social and artistic sensitivity.

The screenplay by Nunnally Johnson and I.A.R. Wylie, which received the award for Best Scenario at the same festival, centers on the survivor of an aircraft crash who contacts the relatives of three of the victims he came to know on board the flight. The story employs flashbacks to relive the three characters' pasts. Plot After his wife Jane (Helen Westcott) admits to an extramarital affair, Iowa attorney David Trask (Gary Merrill) abandons her and their daughters and heads for Los Angeles. His flight is delayed, and while waiting in the airport restaurant he meets a few of his fellow passengers. Troubled alcoholic Dr. Robert Fortness (Michael Rennie), haunted by his responsibility for a car accident in which a colleague, Dr. Tim Brooks (Hugh Beaumont) was killed, is returning home to his wife Claire (Beatrice Straight) and teenage son Jerry (Ted Donaldson), and plans to tell the district attorney the truth about the accident. Aspiring actress Binky Gay (Shelley Winters) is hoping to free her husband Mike Carr (Craig Stevens) from the clutches of his domineering mother, former vaudevillian Sally Carr (Evelyn Varden), who looks down on Binky. Boisterous traveling salesman Eddie Hoke (Keenan Wynn), who is always ready with a bad joke or a silly idea, shares a photograph of his young, attractive wife Marie (Bette Davis) wearing a swimsuit. When a storm forces the aircraft (Douglas DC-3) to land en route, they continue to share their life stories during the unexpected four-hour layover. They exchange home phone numbers with the idea that they may one day have a reunion. Upon resuming their journey, the aircraft crashes and Trask is one of a handful of survivors; most of the passengers and crew are killed, including Trask's three acquaintances. Trask contacts their families by phone and invites himself to their homes. Claire confides that Jerry has run off because he blames her for his father's frequent absences and drinking. Trask finds the young man and convinces him to return home, even for a short while, to hear what he has to say about his father. Claire objects to Jerry learning the truth about the car accident and about how she went along with a lie to protect both her husband and her son, but when Trask explains Fortness' deep sense of guilt and his determination to right the wrong he had committed, Jerry has a change of attitude. Hoping to change Sally's opinion of her late daughter-in-law, he tells her Binky had been cast as Mary Martin's replacement in South Pacific on Broadway and had recommended Sally for a role. Mike thanks Trask for giving Binky \\"such a beautiful success. The kind she always dreamed about, but never could have\\". Trask's final visit is to Marie; he discovers she is not the beautiful girl of Eddie's photograph, but an invalid paralyzed from the waist down. Marie reveals that early in her marriage she had left Eddie, whom she found to be vulgar and tiresome, for another man, Marty Nelson (Warren Stevens). The two planned to drive to Chicago, stopping here and there and enjoying their new freedom together. During one such stopover at a lake, however, Marie hit her head on the underside of a dock while swimming and received her paralyzing injury. Marty abandoned her. While in the hospital, confined to an iron lung and feeling hopeless, Eddie, completely forgiving her and saying, \\"Hiya, beautiful,\\" came to take her home. Marie tells Trask that despite his often obnoxious behavior, Eddie was the most decent man she had ever known, and had taught her the true meaning of love. Marie's story teaches Trask a lesson about marital infidelity and true reconciliation; he calls Jane to tell her he's returning home.

Weinberg) (1923 ‚Äì July 1, 1999) was an Orthodox Jewish rabbi, Talmudist, and rosh yeshiva (dean) of Ner Israel Rabbinical College in Baltimore, Maryland, one of the major American non-Hasidic yeshivas. Rabbi Weinberg also served as a leading rabbinical advisor and board member of a number of important Haredi and Orthodox institutions such as Torah Umesorah, Agudath Israel of America and the Association for Jewish Outreach Programs. Early life and family Weinberg was a scion of the Slonimer Hasidic dynasty. He was the great-great- grandson of Rabbi Avraham of Slonim, author of Yesod HaAvodah and founder of the dynasty, and the grandson of Rabbi Noah Weinberg of Slonim and Tiberias, whom the first Slonimer Rebbe had sent to Palestine to establish a Torah community in the late 19th century. His father, Rabbi Yitzchak Mattisyahu Weinberg, a son of Rabbi Noah Weinberg, was married three times. His first wife died while giving birth to his son, Chaim Yosef David. His second wife also bore him a son, Avraham, before they divorced. Rabbi Yitzchak Mattisyahu married his third wife, Ayala Hinda Loberbaum, the daughter of Rabbi Avner Loberbaum of Safed, when he was in his thirties, and she was but fourteen. They had five children. The first two, Moshe and Chava Leah (later married to R' Avraham Chaim Pincus), were born in 1910 and a year or so later. During World War I, Rabbi Yitzchak Mattisyahu was forced to leave Palestine and move to America because he was framed in the killing a young Arab girl; he brought his family to join him in New York in 1921. His and Hinda's third child, Yaakov, was born in 1923. Then they had a girl named Chaya (Helene). Their youngest child, Noah, was born in 1931. In 1931 Hinda took her two youngest sons to visit her family in Palestine and ended up staying for three years. During that time, Yaakov Weinberg attended cheder in Tiberias and later learned in the Etz Chaim Yeshiva in Jerusalem. Upon their return to America, Weinberg attended Yeshiva Torah Vodaas and Yeshivas Chofetz Chaim, and later studied at Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin under Rabbi Yitzchok Hutner. Weinberg was regarded as a top student and was assigned to weekend rabbinical duties at the age of 19. Rabbi Hutner gave him semicha in 1944 when he was 21. Marriage and family position at Ner Israel In 1945, Weinberg married Shaina Chana Ruderman, the only child of Rabbi Yaakov Yitzchok Ruderman, founder of the Ner Israel yeshiva. They had two boys and four girls. Weinberg excelled in Talmudic scholarship, as a rabbinical advisor and in teaching ability. Weinberg eventually succeeded his father-in-law as the main rosh yeshiva of Ner Israel yeshiva, but not before undertaking a number of other rosh yeshiva positions. Weinberg has 40 grandchildren. In 1964, Weinberg went to the Yeshivas Ner Yisroel of Toronto originally the Toronto branch of Ner Israel, where he served as dean until 1971. He then returned to Baltimore but went on to serve for a short time as rosh yeshiva at the now defunct Kerem Yeshiva founded by his son, Rabbi Matis Weinberg, in Santa Clara, California. However, following the death of his father-in-law, Rabbi Ruderman, he became the permanent rosh yeshiva of Ner Israel in Baltimore in 1987 until his death in 1999. Advisor and teacher of other rabbis Weinberg was regarded as a master logician, with broad knowledge and depth in all aspects of Jewish law and philosophy. He was also a sought-after counselor, involved in hundreds of private and public issues and concerns within the Jewish community. He often took the lead in \\"question and answer\\" sessions at Torah Umesorah conventions where hundreds of rabbis would seek his counsel and many of these teachings have been published, as in Rav Yaakov Weinberg Talks About Chinuch His student Rabbi Boruch Leff based his teachings on Weinberg's methods in Forever His Students: Powerful essays and lessons on contemporary Jewish life, inspired by the teachings of Rabbi Yaakov Weinberg. Weinberg had a close relationship with his brother, Noach Weinberg, and was held in high esteem by the Aish HaTorah yeshiva for baalei teshuva that the latter founded. The two Weinberg brothers remained close and Yaakov Weinberg was a frequent guest lecturer at Aish HaTorah, where most of his lectures have been preserved and even transcribed. An example is his lecture about \\"The Palestinians: Facts & Fables\\" and his views on the subject. Influence in the broader Orthodox world He was involved with a variety of communities, including the Iranian Jewish community for which Ner Yisroel developed a rabbinic training program. Spokesman and leader of Orthodox organizations Rabbi Weinberg was a member of the rabbinical board of Torah Umesorah - National Society for Hebrew Day Schools and was a frequent scholar in residence at Torah Umesorah annual conventions and retreats. His teachings were deemed to be significant enough to have been printed in Torah Umesorah publications, such as in a book published in 1975 titled Building Jewish Ethical Character where a chapter is devoted to Rabbi Weinberg's lectures on \\"Mitzvos as 'Springboards' for Ethical behavior\\".Building Jewish Ethical Character: Section II: \\"Ethics in the Classroom\\" by Rabbi Jacob S. Weinberg. (Joseph Kamenetsky and Murray Friedman, editors) pp. 73-76. The Fryer Foundation and Torah Umesorah publishers. New York, 1975. His activities and views were also cited in a 1982 work researched and published by Professor William Helmreich at CUNY Graduate Center, titled The World of the Yeshiva: An Intimate Portrait of Orthodox Jewry.The World of the Yeshiva: An Intimate Portrait of Orthodox Jewry: Chapter 10: Is the Yeshiva Successful in Reaching Its Goals?: Reaching Uncommitted Jews, pp. 286-7, by William B. Helmreich. (The Free Press/Collier Macmillan, New York, 1982) AJOP The Association for Jewish Outreach Programs, originally known as the Association for Jewish Outreach Professionals, (AJOP), devoted to the cause of Orthodox Jewish outreach (kiruv) was launched in 1988 and Rabbi Weinberg was chosen as its lead rabbinic advisor, a post he retained until his death in 1999. AJOP was launched with the backing of the AVI CHAI Foundation that provided several million dollars as seed money for AJOP to establish itself and run its first number of annual conventions. At the same time the AVI CHAI Foundation also endowed a new institute at the Ner Israel yeshiva in Baltimore known as the MAOR Institute that would train its yeshiva graduates to become proficient \\"outreach rabbis\\" that would dovetail with AJOP's mission of enhancing the already extant field of outreach workers. Thus Rabbi Weinberg headed both MAOR and AJOP that were both aimed and enhancing the field of reaching out to non-Orthodox Jews. Weinberg guarded his position in AJOP and ensured that his allies, such as Rabbi Ephraim Buchwald (AJOP first president) and himself the founder of another multi million dollar AVI Chai Foundation project the National Jewish Outreach Program (NJOP), remained in its leadership positions. When AJOP published a seminal work in 1990 by Rabbi Moshe Weinberger titled Jewish Outreach: Halakhic Perspectives it was Rabbi Weinberg who gave his written approbation and blessings to the work and its author.Jewish Outreach: Halakhic Perspectives, p. viii, by Rabbi Moshe Weinberger. (K'tav Publishing and AJOP) New York, 1990 Writings Many of Rabbi Weinberg's teachings have been published in essay and book form in Orthodox publications. Targum Press published Rabbi Weinberg's Fundamentals and Faith: Insights into the Rambam's Thirteen Principles. In turn, Weinberg's ideas from this work are quoted in another work about Jewish ethics titled Bridging the Gap. Orthodox magazines, such as The Jewish Observer, have published many of Rabbi Weinberg's speeches that later were also reprinted in ArtScroll books. For example, in A Path Through the Ashes, there is an essay by Weinberg about The Destruction of European Jewry: A Churban of Singular Dimensions.A Path Through the Ashes: Penetrating analyses and inspiring stories of the Holocaust from a Torah perspective: II: The Surviving Generation Looks Back: The Destruction of European Jewry: A Churban of Singular Dimensions by Rabbi Yaakov Weinberg. (Rabbi Nisson Wolpin editor.) (Mesorah Publications and Agudath Israel), Brooklyn, NY, 1986 After his death, his students compiled and published his work on Maimonides, entitled Meoros HaRambam. Ner Israel Archive has been digitizing Rabbi Weinberg's legacy for a number of years. Death and legacy Weinberg succumbed to cancer that spread very quickly. His funeral was held at the Ner Israel yeshiva. Weinberg was succeeded as the senior rosh yeshiva of Ner Israel yeshiva by Rabbi Kulefsky, another disciple of both Rabbi Hutner and Rabbi Ruderman; Rabbi Aharon Feldman took his place after a short time. Unlike Rabbi Weinberg, Rabbi Feldman was accepted and serves as a full member of the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah of the American Agudath Israel. Following Rabbi Weinberg's death, it has been mostly the family of Rabbi Herman N. Neuberger that has dominated the yeshiva and none of Weinberg's sons have succeeded him in any official role in the Ner Israel yeshiva. Rabbi Weinberg's son-in-law, Rabbi Beryl Weisbord, was appointed as Ner Israel yeshiva's mashgiach ruchani (spiritual guide); he is married to Rabbi Weinberg's daughter Dr. Aviva Weisbord who has a doctorate in psychology. Rabbi Weinberg's son, Rabbi Matis Weinberg, has also served as rosh yeshiva of a number of institutions in America and Israel. He is presently an international lecturer on Judaism and an author of a number of Torah works. Another son, Rabbi Simcha Weinberg, is a lecturer on Judaism. He was married to the daughter of Rabbi Maurice Lamm and had served in a number of rabbinical posts, including that of rabbi of the prestigious Lincoln Square Synagogue in Manhattan. Yesh Atid MK Rabbi Dov Lipman received semicha from Weinberg and has often cited him. Rabbi Yochanan Zweig was a close student of Weinberg and received Semicha from him as well.

Description The station is located at 18770 Road 26, approximately north of the city limits of Madera, and immediately north of the boundary of Madera Acres. It is easily accessible from Highway 99 (Golden State Highway) by taking the Cleveland Avenue interchange (Exit 155) and then heading east as Cleveland Avenue quickly curves to the north and becomes Country Club Drive. Continue north on Country Club Drive, which eventually becomes Road 26, until the station is reached (at what would be about Avenue 18¬æ). The Madera Golf and Country Club is located just northwest of the station. The station has a payphone, Quik-Trak automated ticket kiosk, restrooms, and two shelters, but no indoor waiting area. An unattended 26 space parking lot is available at the station, but long-term parking is discouraged. Of the 78 California stations regularly served by Amtrak, Madera was the 51st-busiest in Fiscal Year 2013, boarding or detraining an average of approximately 75 passengers daily. The April 2016 revisions to California High-Speed Rail's business plan added a stop at the existing Madera station. The station is not intended to be a full-service passenger station, but a transfer point to Amtrak trains, as this will be the only Phase I station in the Central Valley where both services are co-located. The addition was partially the result of comments from the public review period. Several Madera County officials praised the addition of the high-speed rail stop. Layout The station has one side platform which serves the single track. History Storey (Madera) station, December 2001 For over a hundred years, the area was served by the former Storey Train Station, which was located about east-northeast of Madera in the community of Storey. That \\"station\\" consisted of not much more than a sign along the tracks indicating where the train would stop if it was flagged. When Amtrak took over nearly all passenger rail service in the United States in 1971, there was no longer any passenger service to the area. Amtrak resumed passenger rail served to Storey station (which Amtrak called Madera) with the San Joaquin on October 30, 1977. Although Amtrak substantially improved the conditions at the former Madera (Storey) station, after about dozen years of service, official discussion began regarding improving the station. However, it took nearly a decade for any action. As the project plans developed over the next decade, the option of an entirely new station was selected over improvements to the existing one. Madera station passenger platform In August 2010, ground was broken on this new station. The grand opening of the new Amtrak station took place on November 4, 2010, but regular service did not begin until the 8th. The $2 million station project, which included a new platform, shelter, lighting, access road and landscaping, involved the city of Madera, Amtrak, BNSF Railway and Caltrans. Funding came from Madera County‚Äôs ‚ÄúMeasure T,‚Äù a ¬Ω cent transportation improvement sales tax, the state of California and the California Transportation Commission. Over the next three years, the new station saw a nearly 25% increase in ridership and received additional improvements to the station, including solar panels. Since being replaced, nearly all evidence of the former Madera (Storey) station has been entirely removed. When the new station opened, service by the San Joaquin had increased substantially from the once daily runs in each direction. By 2010 the San Joaquin ran twice daily (in each direction) between Sacramento and Bakersfield and four times daily (in each direction) between Oakland and Bakersfield. Future The 2016 California High-Speed Rail Business Plan included yet another relocated Madera station in order to provide greater accessibility and connections between that system and San Joaquin services. Funding for that station was provided as part of the Valley Rail project in 2018. Work on station relocation is ongoing , as the San Joaquin Joint Powers Authority has entered into negotiations with CAHSR, Madera County, and the city of Madera. the new station at Avenue 12 is expected to open in 2023.

It was an adaptation of the Corinne Griffith memoir of the same name, about her father and growing up in Texarkana, Texas. Jimmy Van Heusen (music) and Sammy Cahn (lyrics) won an Academy Award for Best Original Song for \\"Call Me Irresponsible\\". Another Cahn/Van Heusen song, \\"Walking Happy\\", was used in a scene with Gleason and his on-screen daughter Linda Bruhl walking down a street while he sings about the people they meet along the way, but the scene was cut before the film's release. The song was later used in a Broadway musical of the same name. Plot Jack Griffith, known as \\"Papa\\" to all, is a family man in a Texas town, but an irresponsibly eccentric one when he has had a drink too many. To impress his six-year-old daughter Corinne, he spends the family's savings to buy his own circus, simply so the little girl can have her own pony. His elder daughter Augusta becomes distraught as her father makes some questionable business deals under the influence of alcohol. This causes strife within the Griffith household and makes her beau's father (the local bank president) forbid his son to associate with the Griffith family. After his squandering leaves the Griffiths in debt, wife Ambolyn packs up Augusta and Corinne and moves to Texarkana, Texas, where her father, Anthony Ghio, is the mayor. Griffith attempts to use his circus to help Ghio's bid for reelection, but accidentally causes Ambolyn to end up with a broken hand. Despondent, he leaves for Louisiana and is little seen or heard from by the family. Talked into an attempt at reconciliation, Papa is reluctant, believing the Griffiths want nothing more to do with him, but he is welcomed back with open arms.

It has been described as one of the most influential books on the history of the American South of the past 50 years.Judith Carney, Black Rice, pp. 3-4. He is a professor at Duke University in North Carolina. Early life and education The son of Barry Wood and Mary Lee Wood, Peter H. Wood was educated at the Gilman School in Baltimore, Maryland, and Harvard University. He studied at Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar and returned to Harvard for a Ph.D. He played lacrosse while an undergraduate at Harvard and later at Oxford. Wood wrote the original version of Black Majority: Negroes in Colonial South Carolina from 1670 through the Stono Rebellion as his PhD dissertation, which was awarded a prize. Published in 1974, it was part of major revisions in the ways historians studied African-American history. At around the same time, a dozen major books were published on American slavery. African rice thesis In Black Majority: Negroes in Colonial South Carolina from 1670 through the Stono Rebellion (1974), Wood showed that South Carolina rice planters during the Colonial Era chose enslaved Africans specifically from the \\"Rice Coast\\" of West Africa because of their expertise in rice cultivation and its technology. The African region stretched between what is now Senegal and Gambia in the north to Sierra Leone and Liberia in the south. African farmers in that region had been growing indigenous African rice for thousands of years and were experts in cultivating the difficult crop. They were also familiar with Asian rice, having obtained it via the trans-Saharan trade or through contact with early Portuguese shippers. Wood demonstrated that Africans from the Rice Coast brought the knowledge and technical skills to develop extensive cultivation that made rice one of the most lucrative industries in early America. They knew how to design and build the major earthworks: dams and irrigation systems for flooding and draining fields, that supported rice culture, as well as techniques for cultivation, harvesting and processing. By proving that Africans contributed their sophisticated knowledge and skills to the building of America and not just their physical labor, Wood set a new tone in Southern historiography and opened an area of study. His book has been in print since it was first published in 1973. Wood's Black Majority gave rise to a tradition of scholarship on the African roots of rice cultivation in colonial America. It influenced the writings of other scholars, including Daniel C. Littlefield (Rice and Slaves), Charles Joyner (Down by the Riverside), Amelia Vernon (African Americans at Mars Bluff, South Carolina), Julia Floyd Smith (Slavery and Rice Culture in Low Country Georgia), Judith A. Carney (Black Rice), and Edda Fields-Black (Deep Roots). In addition, Wood's insights about the links between the African Rice Coast and the Gullah people in coastal South Carolina and Georgia, modern descendants of the rice-growing slaves, led to reappraisal of their language and culture. It contributed to historians who have examined the continuities between African cultures and those the people created in different regions of the present-day United States. It also influenced the work of the public historian Joseph Opala, who organized a series of notable \\"homecomings\\" to Sierra Leone for Gullah people. Gullah origins Wood explained why the Gullah people have preserved so much more of their African cultural heritage than other black communities in the U.S. The slave ships coming from Africa brought mosquitos which introduced malaria and yellow fever to the semi-tropical \\"low country\\" region bordering the South Carolina coast. In addition, some of the surviving slaves likely carried these endemic diseases. The mosquitoes bred in the conditions of the rice fields, and as the rice industry expanded, so did the diseases they carried. Wood showed that the Africans were more resistant to these tropical fevers, because they were endemic in their homeland. White colonists avoided the low country because of disease. Although planters maintained plantations on the Sea Islands, they preferred to live in the cities of Charleston or Savannah. Because of the diseases and the expansion of large rice and indigo plantations, with their need for many laborers, South Carolina had a \\"black majority\\" by about 1708. In addition, the continuing importation of slaves from the Rice Coast meant that the people were renewed from specific tribal cultures, rather than being mixed. This demographic environment is what enabled Africans in the low country to retain more of their cultural heritage than slaves elsewhere in North America. In addition, the slaves in the low country, and especially plantations of the Sea Islands, had much less contact with whites than did those in areas such as Virginia or North Carolina, where whites were in the majority. Before Wood conceived his \\"black majority\\" argument, the origin of Gullah culture was not well understood. In Virginia and North Carolina, by contrast, many slaves were held in small numbers by individual families on subsistence farms. Even those held in larger numbers on plantations experienced change as crops were shifted from tobacco to mixed farming. This increased their interaction with whites. Professor Wood continued to write about Africans in colonial America. He teaches history at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. Personal Wood married Ann Douglas in September 1965. They later divorced, and Wood remarried, to Elizabeth A. Fenn in 1999.

Biography  √† Brakel was best known for his work with the Further Reformation, which was contemporaneous with and greatly influenced by English Puritanism. Scholars in the Netherlands have defined this movement as follows: √† Brakel and his ministry functioned at the approximate center of this Pietistic movement, both historically and theologically. Beginning in 1606 with the ministry of his father, Willem Teellinck of the Further Reformation, and terminating in 1784 with the death of Theodorus Vander Groe, √† Brakel's ministry, particularly his most important pastorate in Rotterdam from 1683‚Äì1711, falls in the middle of the timeline. More significantly, his ministry represented a remarkable balance of the Further Reformation relative to both its early and concluding stages.  The Christian's Reasonable Service  √† Brakel's prominence as a major representative of this movement is largely due to his magnum opus, The Christian's Reasonable Service. After its initial publication in 1700, his four-volume work was soon recognized as a monumental contribution to the literature of the Further Reformation. It has been argued by scholars that this work is a synthesis of the best Puritan literature published in England and the Netherlands. Further Reformation scholar F. Earnest Stoeffler stated, ‚ÄúHe supplied Reformed Pietism with a theological textbook which came out of a tradition wholly native to the Netherlands. He preserved the balance between the mystical and ethical elements in Christianity which is so characteristic of the great Pietists in the Reformed communion.‚Äù As a result of this work, √† Brakel has become important to Reformed believers in the Netherlands, both during his lifetime and beyond. He is fondly referred to as ‚ÄúFather Brakel‚Äù, a title by which he is still known in the Netherlands. For more than three centuries, the influence of The Christian's Reasonable Service has been such that √† Brakel continues to be one of the most significant representatives of the Further Reformation. Since the publication of The Christian's Reasonable Service in English, his reputation has grown among scholars and followers of Puritan literature. √† Brakel's work is particularly distinguished for going beyond the systematic theology found at the time. His selection of the title is an indication that it was not his intention to merely present a systematic explanation of Christian dogma to the public. In directly quoting the Bible for his title, √† Brakel indicated to Christians that it is an entirely reasonable matter for a man to quote the Bible to show belief and following of the book. His choice also conveyed that God asks men to serve him in spirit and truth, doing so in a reasonable manner. √† Brakel wrote this work for church members and not for theologians, though he hoped that theologians could benefit from it as well. To accomplish this, he ensured that The Christian's Reasonable Service was permeated with a practical application of the doctrines he explains. In his writing, √† Brakel wished that the principles he expounded could become an experiential reality to those who read his work. He established the crucial relationship between objective beliefs and the subjective experience of those beliefs. Experiential theology explains how the doctrines of the Bible become a reality in the hearts and lives of believers. Religious experiences are seen as bringing religious beliefs from text into subjective involvement. In the theological sections of his chapters, √† Brakel lays the groundwork for experiential application. His aim in practicing theology is to edify believers. He does this by describing what the experiential application of the expounded doctrine should be and by describing what it often is when believers struggle to appropriate the words of the Bible.

She married producer George Edwardes. Life and career Gwynne was born Julia Lavinia Putney at Marylebone, London, England in 1856 to David Putney and his wife, who owned the 'Black Boy' public house in Hampstead.Hyman, Alan The Gaiety Years, Cassell London (1975) Early career Julia Gwynne in about 1880 George Edwardes, later Gwynne's husband, was a manager for Richard D'Oyly Carte at the Opera Comique and later Carte's managing director of the Savoy Theatre. He brought Gwynne with him in 1879 to join the chorus in D'Oyly Carte's company in Gilbert and Sullivan's hit opera H.M.S. Pinafore.Ayre, p.138 Gwynne's sister, actress Emma Gwynne (born Emma Putney), also sang in Iolanthe with Gwynn. During Pinafore, Gwynne was called before the stage manager, Richard Barker, for laughing on stage during a performance. Despite her protest that it was only her \\"natural amiable expression,\\" she was fined half a crown.Baily, Leslie The Gilbert and Sullivan Book, Cassell & Co Ltd, London (1952) Gwynne then played Maria in Frank Desprez and Alfred Cellier's companion piece, After All! from 1879‚Äì80, when Jessie Bond travelled to New York City to create the role of Edith in the American production of The Pirates of Penzance. When Pirates received its London premiere in April 1880, Gwynne created the role of Edith there. Bond returned in July to play Edith, and Gwynne switched to the smaller role of Kate and also played the role of Mrs. Liverby in the new curtain raiser, In the Sulks, by Desprez and Cellier.Gwynne at the Whowaswho website Gwynne created the part of Lady Saphir in the next Gilbert and Sullivan opera, Patience, which opened in April 1881, and she played Mrs. Liverby when In the Sulks was part of the programme. She also played the role of Lady Melusine in Gilbert's Broken Hearts at a benefit performance at the Savoy in 1882 and again in 1885. Gwynne next created the role of Leila in Iolanthe in 1882 but left the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in January 1883.The Era mention of Gwynne's last night Later years George Power, Leonora Braham, Jessie Bond and Gwynne at Sullivan's memorial in 1914 Gwynne then created the part of Dmitri in Herman Charles Merivale's adaptation of Sardou's F√©dora at the Haymarket Theatre in May 1883.Richards, Jeffrey. Sir Henry Irving: A Victorian Actor and His World (2005) Continuum International Publishing Group In the summer of 1883, she returned to the Savoy Theatre, playing Leila in Iolanthe again. After that, it appears that she left D'Oyly Carte for the last time. Although musical director Francois Cellier described her as the \\"life and soul\\" of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, stage manager Richard Barker continued to fine Gwynne for laughing on stage or for unauthorised costume augmentations. She joked with W. S. Gilbert that the Savoy Theatre was \\"built out of her fines.\\" Gwynne's marriage to Edwardes on 9 July 1885 was opposed by Gwynne's Protestant mother, as Edwardes was a Roman Catholic. However, Gwynne converted to Catholicism, and the marriage went ahead at Maiden Lane Roman Catholic church. Edwardes went on to have great success in his own right as a theatrical impresario at the Gaiety Theatre, London and other West End theatres, first producing the theatre's musical burlesques and then virtually inventing the genre of Edwardian musical comedy. Ironically, Gwynne's roles outside of those with the D'Oyly Carte organisation appear to have been in legitimate theatre rather than musical theatre. She continued to act until about 1887, performing at the Haymarket Theatre in 1883‚Äì84, including in Richard Sheridan's comedy, The Rivals, as Lucy,Information about The Rivals and in The Bachelors, an adaptation from the German by Robert Williams Buchanan and Hermann Vezin.Review of The Bachelors Gwynne retired from the stage following the birth of her daughter (Dorothy) and son (D'Arcy). Together with George Power, Jessie Bond and Leonora Braham, she was one of four artistes of the original D'Oyly Carte Opera Company who attended a reunion at the Savoy Hotel in 1914. The four then posed for a group photograph beside the Sullivan monument in the Victoria Embankment Gardens. Gwynne died in London on 10 June 1934.

The history of Christendom during the European Middle Ages and the Early Modern period has resulted in a number of traditions that are shared in many European ethnic and regional cultures. This concerns notably common traditions based on Christian mythology, i.e. certain commonalities in celebrating Christmas, such as the various Christmas gift-bringers, or customs associated with All Souls' Day. In addition, there are certain apotropaic gestures or practices found in large parts of the Western world, such as the knocking on wood or the fingers crossed gesture. History The culture of Classical Antiquity, including mythology, Hellenistic religion and magical or cultic practice was very influential on the formative stage of Christianity, and can be found as a substrate in the traditions of all territories formerly colonized by the Roman Empire, and by extension in those territories reached by Christianization during the Middle Ages. This includes all of Europe, and much of the Middle East and North Africa. These traditions inherited from folk beliefs in the Roman era were syncretized with local traditions, notably Germanic, Celtic and Slavic. Many folk traditions also originated by contact with the Islamic world, especially in the Balkans and in the Iberian peninsula, which were ruled by Islamic empires before being re-conquered (in the case of the Balkans, partially) by Christian forces. The result of such cultural contact is visible e.g. in the tradition of the Morris Dance in England, an adaptation of the \\"moorish\\" dances of the late medieval period. The result were the related, but regionally distinct, folk traditions as they existed in European society on the eve of the Early Modern period. In modern times, and especially since the 19th century, there has been much cross-pollination between these traditions, often by the detour of American folklore.

Galantini became a noted educator in Florence and Pope Leo XI - an associate of his - dubbed Galantini as the \\"Apostle of Florence\\" due to his activism in educational affairs. He was subject to malicious attacks - even one failed assassination attempt - and was once accused of harboring heretical views though was exonerated from all charges. The beatification cause culminated with the confirmation of heroic virtue from Pope Benedict XIV in 1756. Pope Leo XII later beatified Galantini in Saint Peter's Basilica on 19 June 1825. Life Ippolito Galantini was born in Florence on 12 October 1565 to a poor silk weaver. In his childhood he was charismatic and instructed fellow children in catechism. He wanted to be able to enter the religious life but this never would eventuate. In 1577 he attracted the attention of the then- Archbishop of Florence Alessandro Ottaviano de' Medici - the future Pope Leo XI - who later bestowed upon him the church of Santa Lucia al Prato for him to work in and to continue his educational pursuits in. But he also dabbled in silk weaving - like his father - while juggling his educational obligations. In 1582 he asked for admittance into the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin but was rejected on the grounds of poor health and he decided instead to found an educational movement. He taught at a Jesuit church. The educational institution he established in 1604 would forever alter the Florentine educational institution and he was soon asked to travel to other places to establish his educational institute in those places. There were those who were jealous and malicious towards him and some accused him of sharing the views of Martin Luther and thus branded him as schismatic. There was an assassination attempt planned but this failed to kill him. He was also accused of harboring heretical statements but was exonerated of these charges due to the charge being deemed false. In 1602 various benefactors made it possible for him to establish a chapel that Pope Clement VIII requested be named in honor of Saint Francis of Assisi. He made a pilgrimage to Loreto towards the end of his life to put his movement under the intercession of the Madonna. He died in Florence on 20 March 1619. Beatification Pope Benedict XIV confirmed his heroic virtue in 1756 and named him as Venerable and Pope Leo XII later beatified Galantini in Saint Peter's Basilica on 19 June 1825.

It derives its name from the town of Montbrison in the Loire department. The word fourme is derived from the Latin word forma meaning \\"shape\\", the same root from which the French word fromage is believed to have been derived. The cheese is manufactured in tall cylindrical blocks weighing between . The blocks are 13 centimetres in diameter and 19 centimetres tall, although the cheese is most frequently sold in shops in much shorter cylindrical slices. Fourme de Montbrison has a characteristic orange-brown rind with a creamy-coloured p√¢te, speckled with gentle streaks of blue mould. Its Appellation d'Origine Contr√¥l√©e status was granted in 1972 under a joint decree with Fourme d'Ambert, a similar blue cheese also from the same region. In 2002 the two cheeses received AOC status in their own right, recognizing the differences in their manufacture. With a musty scent, the cheese is extremely mild for a blue cheese and has a dry taste. Manufacture The curd is salted and placed into a mould before being removed and placed on racks made from spruce wood. The cheese is then turned by hand, ninety degrees at a time, over a period of twelve hours. The cheese is injected with penicillium roqueforti spores, and later injected with air to form pockets in the p√¢te to encourage spore development. The cheese must be aged for at least 28 days, though more often it is left for around 8 weeks. Around of milk are used to make each cheese. By regulation the cheese may only be manufactured in any of 33 communes of the Monts du Forez in the departments of Puy-de-D√¥me and Loire. The finished cheese is a minimum of 50% fat, and although the majority of production uses pasteurised milk, the growing artisanal manufacturers are using unpasteurized milk. The total production in 2005 was 495 tons.

Arnold Ipolyi (family name originally Stummer) (20 October 1823 ‚Äì 2 December 1886) was a Hungarian bishop and historian. Life Ipolyi was born in Ipolykeszi, Hungary (currently Kosihy nad Ipƒæomin, Slovakia). At the age of 13 he entered the ranks of the alumni of the Archdiocese of Esztergom, studied two years in the Emericianum at Pozsony and later at Nagyszombat, and finished at the P√°zm√°neum at Vienna, where he attended lectures on theology for four years. In 1844 he entered the seminary of Esztergom, took minor orders in 1845, and was ordained priest in 1847. From 1845 to 1847 he acted as tutor in the family of Baron Medny√°nszky, was then curate at Kom√°romszentp√©ter (German: Komorn-Sankt-Peter), in 1848 preacher at Bratislava, in 1849 spent a short time as tutor in the family of Count Palffy, and became in this year parish priest of Zohor. Even before his ordination he concerned himself with historical and art-historical matters. In 1854 his Ungarische Mythologic came out, as the first-fruit of his work, in which he treats of the ancient religion of Hungary. Although the work won the prize offered by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, the author afterwards withdrew it from the press, so that at the present time it is very rare. In 1860 Ipolyi became parish priest at T√∂r√∂kszentmikl√≥s. Accompanied by Franz Kubinyi and Emerich Henszlmann, he made in 1862 a journey to Constantinople, where he discovered the remainder of the library of Matthias Corvinus. In 1863 he was made canon of Eger, and in 1869 director of the Central Ecclesiastical Seminary at Pest; in 1871 he became Bishop of Beszterceb√°nya, and Bishop of Nagyv√°rad where he died on 2 December later that same year. Ipolyi was member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, as well as a member of different learned Societies at home and abroad. He was one of the founders and at first vice-president, then president of the Hungarian Historical Society. His literary activity extended into the provinces of history, art-history, archaeology, and Christian art. He enriched the Hungarian National Gallery with sixty valuable paintings. He bequeathed to Nagyv√°rad (today Oradea, Romania) in his will, for the purpose of founding a museum, his collections which had been brought together with a great expert knowledge of art.

The station was opened with the extension of the broad gauge line from Cheddar on 5 April 1870. It was converted to standard gauge in the mid-1870s and then became Wells' main station when the Cheddar Valley line was linked up to the East Somerset Railway to provide through services from Yatton to Witham in 1878.

The East Somerset station at this stage closed, but GWR trains ran through Priory Road without stopping for a further 56 years, until in 1934 they started to call at the S&D; station. Priory Road closed in 1951 with the closure of the S&D; branch line from Glastonbury and Street, leaving Tucker Street as the only station in Wells. In fact, as the \\"main\\" station on the most direct line from other centres of population, Tucker Street station was known simply as \\"Wells\\" for the first 50 years of its life, being renamed only on 12 July 1920.

And it has been working with other organizations to include rehabilitation for polio survivors in the current program for the worldwide eradication of polio. PHI‚Äôs core constituency is in North America, but its networks of polio survivors, clinicians, scientists, and historians have always been widely international.

PHI is not itself a support group, but rather a network and resource for such groups. It is not a treatment facility, but rather a directory to such facilities and a reference desk for information about specific polio or ventilator related problems. Its many publications such as its Handbook,Maynard, Frederick M. and Joan L. Headley, eds., Handbook on the Late Effects of Poliomyelitis for Physicians and Survivors. Published by PHI. Funded by the March of Dimes. Second edition, 1999. . its two quarterly newsletters, its informational brochures on the late effects of poliomyelitis (published in Chinese, Persian, French, German, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish), and its occasional formal statements on controversial issues such as physical exercise and on anesthesia for people with neuromuscular disabilities are widely referenced.See Post-Polio on MedlinePlus History After the polio epidemics in the United States ended, the March of Dimes had changed its mission from polio to birth defects; most of the special rehabilitation hospitals and clinics devoted to polio survivors were closing; clinical specialists in polio were scattering. Polio survivors (substantially more in 1960 than the CDC-estimated one million in the US who were still alive in 1995)National Center for Health Statistics, National Health Interview Survey on Disability, 1994-1995, special questionnaire on polio, reports and data sets available at https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/major/nhis_dis/nhis_dis.htm Summary and estimates available from PHI at http://www.post-polio.org/ir- usa.html were often isolated from the support needed to cope with maturing and aging with a significant physical disability. PHI at first devoted itself to making sure polio survivors could stay in touch with each other as needed, and with clinicians who had special expertise with polio. These efforts evolved into a variety of publications aimed at providing authoritative information on health issues for polio survivors, and on mainstream opportunities for them ‚Äì as well as for other people with significant physical disabilities ‚Äì in education, employment, family life, travel, and leisure activities. The organization‚Äôs magazine (until 1985), The Rehabilitation Gazette, had those matters as its dominant themes. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, PHI was also at the forefront of what has come to be called the independent living movement (or as Gini Laurie preferred to call it, the interdependent living movement) and was also involved in advocacy for the US 1973 Rehabilitation Act. Accessibility (of public places, education, governmental institutions, and of transportation and accommodations) was a major theme, as was the development of an effective system of home health care and personal attendants to ensure that people with serious physical disabilities would be able to live in the community of adults rather than as perpetual dependents within families or institutions. Toward the end of the 1970s, PHI began to receive an increasing number of reports from polio survivors of new symptoms ‚Äì a constellation of fatigue, decreased endurance, increased muscle weakness and pain ‚Äì that sounded like a repeat of some of the early symptoms of poliomyelitis, or perhaps an accelerated aging process. In concert with clinicians, researchers, and polio survivors, PHI began to publish material on these ‚Äúlate effects of poliomyelitis,‚Äù. And in 1981 PHI convened the first of its international post-polio conferences to address this issue. There have now been nine international PHI conferences on post-polio syndrome and other topics having to do with living and aging with polio. These ‚ÄúSt. Louis conferences‚Äù as they are often called in polio circles, are not always held in St. Louis. The first in the series was held in Chicago, and the tenth was held in Warm Springs, Georgia, in 2009. During the 1980s, as support groups for polio survivors began to form throughout the US and elsewhere, PHI offered help to such groups in various ways ‚Äì especially through its conferences and publications (including directories of support groups and health care professionals), but also through arranging speakers, assisting with local or regional conferences, and sponsoring workshops. PHI is not itself a support group, but rather remains a network in support of such groups, and in support of individual polio survivors, clinicians, and researchers. Until 1984, though always incorporated as a nonprofit organization, PHI had operated entirely with a large network of volunteers, organized and led by Gini Laurie. Financial support came from donors and subscribers to the Rehabilitation Gazette. But after the 1983 St. Louis conference, it was evident that a more formal organizational structure was required. Judith Raymond was hired as Executive Director in 1984, and took over PHI‚Äôs day-to-day operations as well as editorial work on its publications and organizational work on its conferences. She was succeeded in 1987 by Joan L. Headley, who served as Executive Director for 30 years, retiring in 2017. She was succeeded by Brian M. Tiburzi on September 1, 2017.

The station had seven cooling towers which were visible from a wide area. History The first station was brought into operation by the North Metropolitan Electric Power Supply Co. between 1904 and 1907, before officially opening in 1907. It was used primarily to supply the local tramways. The station was extended between 1924 and 1955, supplying power to the wider area of Enfield and Essex. Brimsdown Power Station was the only known British example of the Loeffler boiler system. It was a system that enjoyed a brief vogue in the 1930s, mainly in Europe. It overcame metallurgical and feedwater quality problems but rapid advances rendered it unnecessary quite quickly. The Parsons 25 MW turbo-alternator commissioned in 1928 was the first machine in the UK to generate direct at 33 kV. Coal was supplied by barge or by rail. In 1948 Britain's electricity supply industry was nationalised under the Electricity Act 1947 and Brimsdown Power Station became part of the British Electricity Authority. The BEA was succeeded by the Central Electricity Authority in 1955 and the Central Electricity Generating Board in 1958. The CEGB decommissioned both stations in 1976.  Technical Specification  In 1959 the A station had two Loeffler boilers, steam capacity of the boilers was 330,000 lb/hr (41.6 kg/s) which supplied one 20 MW and one 31 MW Metropolitan Vickers turbo-alternators. CEGB Statistical Yearbook (various dates). CEGB, London. The steam conditions at the turbine stop valve was 1900 psi (131 bar) and 499¬∞C. The overall thermal efficiency of the A station in 1963-64 was 20.16 per cent. In 1959 the B station had four Parsons 25 MW turbo-alternators and one Metropolitan Vickers 56.9 MW twin set. By 1963-64 the B station had 1 √ó 60.27 MW and 1 √ó 60 MW generators. The steam capacity of the associated boilers was 2,305,000 lb/hr (290.4 kg/s). Steam conditions at the 60.27 MW turbine stop valve was 315 / 900 psi (21.7 / 62.1 bar) and 360 / 399 / 482¬∞C. Steam conditions at the 60 MW turbine stop valve was 1900 psi (131 bar) and 499¬∞C. In 1963-64 the overall thermal efficiency of the B station was 23.17 per cent. There were 5 film cooling towers with a capacity of 6.6 million gallons per hour, and two natural draft reinforced concrete cooling towers each with a capacity of 1.56 million gallons per hour. Water was abstracted from the River Lea.

It is headquartered in Ndola. During the colonial period the newspaper was known firstly as The Copperbelt Times and then The Northern News It was a twice- weekly newspaper aimed at a European readership. In 1943, a small printing plant owned by Mr Roy Lentin, situated in Ndola, was sold to Mr Edward Brockman Hovelmeier (1908-2005) and Mr. Wykerd for the purpose of printing small items in their spare time. Mr. Edward Brockman Hovelmeier had experience with print, having been in the advertising field in Johannesburg before relocating to the Copperbelt as a result of the great economic depression so the plant became his direct responsibility. The plant was of a very limited size, comprising two small platen printing machines, other subsidiary items such as a small paper cutter (guillotine), stapler, stitcher etc., also three or four cabinets of type of various fonts and sizes. The Plant was subsequently moved from Ndola to Chingola and opened for business in a corrugated-iron structure which had been a store room owned by Mr. B.I. Menashe, a prominent storekeeper in Chingola. They commenced with production of invoices, cards, small leaflets and other items however their range was limited by the size of the small platen printing machines. Shortly after opening they bought a Phoenix press which enabled them to print larger pieces and eventually a newspaper. They were fully occupied with setting for job printing, when they were cajoled by ambition and desire to help Mr. Roy Welensky into starting a weekly newspaper the ‚ÄúCopperbelt Times‚Äù. There were difficulties with this as their facilities, particularly in the setting of the type, did not allow for this increase in operations. To build the circulation of the Copperbelt Times, it was necessary to have a more central location as Chingola was at the end of the railway line and there were no developed centres beyond it. It was therefore decided to relocate the plant to Ndola. Under the direction of Mr. Edward Brockman Hovelmeier the business was taken to the commercial centre (at that time) of Northern Rhodesia. They were able to obtain from the Custodian of Enemy Property, a building which had been used by the German community of the area as a social centre and it was there that the name of the newspaper was changed from the ‚ÄúCopperbelt Times‚Äù to the ‚ÄúNorthern News‚Äù. The equipment was loaded into a railway truck and went by rail to Ndola. They did not miss an issue of the paper in its transferral. In the new structure Edward Brockman Hovelmeier was co-owner, works manager, editor, investigative reporter, social-items specialist, advertising salesman and layout artist which he eventually relinquished as well as his financial interest in the News Paper to Roy Welensky. It was later owned by the South African newspaper chain Argus. Under the ownership of Tiny Rowland's company Lonhro, it was renamed the Times of Zambia on 1 July 1965 and Richard Seymour Hall was appointed editor. Criticism of the government under the editorship of Dunston Kamana in the early 1970s led to the government intervening to appoint its own editor, Vernon Mwaanga, in 1972. United National Independence Party (UNIP), Zambia's former ruling party, took the newspaper over in 1975. When the Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) came to power in November 1991, it went to court claiming UNIP had illegally taken over the newspapers. The courts found in favour of the MMD, and ruled that the papers' ownership be transfared to the Zambian Government. The Times of Zambia is now owned by the Zambian Government. The newspaper recently went online in English and the site is currently under development.

It is hoped that side effects can be reduced by not disturbing the mevalonate pathway, which is important for other biochemical molecules besides cholesterol. However, there is increasing evidence that statins (which inhibit the mevalonate pathway) may be clinically useful because they affect these other molecules (including protein prenylation).

Data from knockout mouse studies suggests that accumulation of high levels of the metabolic substrate of squalene synthase and derivatives thereof account for the liver toxicity of squalene synthase inhibitors, and efforts to mitigate this substrate accumulation would likely be necessary for clinical success of a squalene synthase inhibitor References Further reading * Hypolipidemic agents Piperidines Carboxamides Benzoxazepines Phenol ethers Chloroarenes Abandoned drugs ","title":"Lapaquistat"},{"id":"14387875","text":"Michael Dickson may refer to: * Michael Dickson (American football) (born 1996), Australian gridiron football punter * Michael Dickson (Irish republican), Scottish former Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) volunteer * Michael Dickson (engineer) (1944‚Äì2018), British structural engineer * Michael Dickson (educator) (born 1977), executive director of StandWithUs Israel * Michael Dickson (skier) (born 1975), Australian Olympic skier * Michael Dickson (hurdler) (born 1994), American track and field sprint hurdler See also * Michael Dixon (disambiguation) ","title":"Michael Dickson"},{"id":"14387881","text":"A stove is an appliance that heats or cooks or both.

From March 1986 to March 1987, the series ran in the Takeshobo manga magazine Tensai Club before the magazine was replaced with Manga Club, where it had been serialized from April 1987 to April 2020. It is also been serialized in Manga Life since April 1986. It has been adapted into an anime television series, as well as two anime films and two video games. While the series is considered a yonkoma manga, most of the \\"stories\\" use eight panels. The series follows the main character, a young sea otter after whom the manga is titled, and his daily adventures with his friends from the nearby forest. Bonobono combines gag comic and philosophical questions, bringing up comparisons to other manga such as Azumanga Daioh, and to films such as Forrest Gump. In 1988, Bonobono won the Kodansha Manga Award in the General category. An anime film was released in theaters on November 13, 1993, and an anime television series was broadcast on TV Tokyo from April 20, 1995 through March 28, 1996. One day after the TV series began, a simulation game was released on the 3DO system. The following June, an adventure game was released on the PlayStation. Several ehon‚Äîor \\"picture books\\"‚Äîhave been released since the manga series was first introduced over 30 years ago. Characters * Bonobono („Åº„ÅÆ„Åº„ÅÆ): A mellow sea otter that lives with his father by the ocean near the forest. His mother died in childbirth. He is a bit naive in the ways of the world, and is curious in general. Never seen without a shellfish in his hand, in case he gets hungry. * Shimarisu- kun/Chipmunk („Ç∑„Éû„É™„Çπ„Åè„Çì): A young chipmunk who's friends with Bonobono. He has a habit of asking if people are going to bully him („ÅÑ„Åò„ÇÅ„Çã? Ijimeru?) and is regularly tormented by Araiguma and his older sister Sh≈ç. However, he does bring some of it on himself; depending on the day, he can unintentionally or even intentionally say things to rile them up. Like Bonobono, he always carries something with him, in his case a walnut. * Araiguma-kun/Racoon („Ç¢„É©„Ç§„Ç∞„Éû„Åè„Çì): A young raccoon who's friends with Bonobono. Has a very short fuse and often plays the tsukkomi for his other two friends. Likes to bully Shimarisu, and often gets into trouble with his father. * Tsunadori Neko- san/Fishing Cat („ÉÑ„Éä„Éâ„É™„Éç„Ç≥„Åï„Çì): An animal who's not native to the Forest, but is the currently named strongest animal there after defeating Higuma no Taish≈ç. Bonobono and friends often ask him questions about certain subjects.

He's a somewhat bumbling man who tries to bond with his son in silly ways. He speaks with pauses in between phrases. Likes to go on long journeys.

Takes out his anger constantly on Araiguma-kun. * Kuzuri- kun/Wolverine („ÇØ„Ç∫„É™„Åè„Çì): A young wolverine that walks on all fours. He has a bad habit of pooping all over the forest. * Kuzuri-kun's Father („ÇØ„Ç∫„É™„Åè„Çì„ÅÆ„Åä„Å®„ÅÜ„Åï„Çì): The father of Kuzuri-kun. The closest thing the Forest has to a medicine man, Kuzuri-kun's Father has plenty of plants and herbs on hand that are relevant to the topic at hand. Resourceful, but somewhat eccentric. He is very proud of his son. * Fenegi-kun/Fennec Kitsune/Fenny („Éï„Çß„Éç„ÇÆ„Åè„Çì): A young fennec fox who's friends with Bonobono and company.

Acts very proper and elegant, but often embellishes information she gets. She desires for Shimarisu-kun to become independent. * Anaguma/Badger („Ç¢„Éä„Ç∞„Éû„Åè„Çì): A stoic young badger who's acquaintances with Bonobono and friends.

He was arrested in Venezuela on September 18, 2012 after trafficking drugs for more than 20 years. The arrest of the drug lord, according to news reports in the New York Times, was the result of a complex four-nation endeavor. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos named Barrera \\"the last of the great kingpins\\". According to the Colombian National Police intelligence service DIJIN, Barrera bribed numerous Colombian policemen in order to maintain his drug emporium in Bogot√°, which has grown after being a key link in the drug business first with members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrilla group and later with members of the United Self- Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) paramilitary group and members Colombian Government Forces. Other aliases Besides being known as \\"El Loco\\" Barrera goes by the names of \\"Germ√°n Barrera\\", \\"Arnoldo Barrera\\", \\"Vicente Rivera\\" or \\"El Gordo\\". Early years According to an article by Colombian magazine Revista Semana, Barrera initiated his illegal drug activities in San Jose del Guaviare in the 1980s under the support of his brother Omar Barrera. His brother was gunned down a few months after being in Guaviare for what he took revenge and respect among the other drug dealers in the region. On February 7, 1990 Barrera was arrested on drug charges by Colombian authorities. After a few months, in October of that same year Barrera escaped from prison. Business with FARC According to Colombian authorities, Barrera was a key associate of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in drug retail and distribution. Barrera was an associate of alias \\"Negro Acacio\\" a renowned guerrilla commander involved in the illegal drug trade business for the FARC. Barrera was a buyer of illegal drugs to many of the Eastern Bloc of the FARC- EP' fronts which included the 14th, 17th, 10th and 16th fronts, as well as contacts with alias \\"John 40\\" guerrilla chief of the 42nd front. Business with paramilitary groups Barrera had parallel illegal drug businesses also with FARC's enemy, the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) bloc; Vencedores de Arauca Bloc which was led by Miguel √Ångel y V√≠ctor Mej√≠a, aliased \\"Los Mellizos\\" (the twins). According to Colombian authorities Barrera also assassinated the commander of the Centauros Bloc of the AUC after presumably having differences. Part of the drug produced by the FARC in western Colombia was bought by Barrera and sold to cartels or paramilitary groups. The Norte del Valle Cartel, as well as small cartels in the Department of Antioquia, the Caribbean region and Department of Narino were among his customers, among these cartels were people strongly associated with the enemy; paramilitary groups. On December 15, 2007 the Colombian newspaper El Tiempo reported that Barrera was the link between the FARC and a new cartel called Los Nevados formed by former paramilitary group and led by alias the \\"Mellizos\\" (the twin [brothers]) V√≠ctor Manuel and Miguel √Ångel Mej√≠a M√∫nera. The drug lord allegedly was also one of the main allies of the neo- paramilitary groups ERPAC, commanded by Pedro Oliveiro Guerrero, aka 'Cuchillo', as well as Los Rastrojos, a group formed by former commanders of one of the military wings of the Norte del Valle cartel Arrest in Venezuela On September 18, 2012, Barrera was arrested by Venezuelan security forces in San Cristobal, a town ten miles from the Colombian border. The arrest was announced by Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos live on national television. According to Santos, Barrera was \\"the last of the great capos.\\" According to Colombia's defense minister, Juan Carlos Pinz√≥n, and the country's national police chief, the arrest was the result of a months-long cooperation between authorities from Colombia and Venezuela, U.K. intelligence agency MI6 and U.S. intelligence agency CIA. Additional investigational support was provided by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and U.S. Treasury Office of Foreign Asset Control. United States Prosecution Charges were announced by three U.S. Attorneys on July 10, 2013. For the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Loretta E. Lynch, and for the Southern District of Florida Wifredo A. Ferrer bring the following charges. In the Southern District of New York, one count of conspiring to distribute and manufacture cocaine knowing it would be unlawfully imported into the United States. On that count, Barrera faces a maximum sentence of life in prison and a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in prison. In the Eastern District of New York, one count of conspiracy to launder money. On that count, Barrera faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. In the Southern District of Florida with one count of conspiring to import cocaine into the United States and one count of conspiring to manufacture and distribute cocaine knowing that it would be unlawfully imported into the United States. On those counts, Barrera faces a maximum sentence of life in prison and a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in prison. On November 20, 2014, Barrera pleaded guilty in the Southern District of New York to conspiring to distribute and manufacture over 400 tons of cocaine per year knowing that it would be imported into the United States. Barrera previously pleaded guilty in the Eastern District of New York to money laundering charges. July 25, 2016, Barrera was sentenced to 35 years in prison and ordered to forfeit $10,000,000.

Analytic torsion (or Ray‚ÄìSinger torsion) is an invariant of Riemannian manifolds defined by as an analytic analogue of Reidemeister torsion. and proved Ray and Singer's conjecture that Reidemeister torsion and analytic torsion are the same for compact Riemannian manifolds. Reidemeister torsion was the first invariant in algebraic topology that could distinguish between closed manifolds which are homotopy equivalent but not homeomorphic, and can thus be seen as the birth of geometric topology as a distinct field. It can be used to classify lens spaces. Reidemeister torsion is closely related to Whitehead torsion; see . It has also given some important motivation to arithmetic topology; see . For more recent work on torsion see the books and . Definition of analytic torsion If M is a Riemannian manifold and E a vector bundle over M, then there is a Laplacian operator acting on the i-forms with values in E. If the eigenvalues on i-forms are Œªj then the zeta function Œ∂i is defined to be :\\\\zeta_i(s) = \\\\sum_{\\\\lambda_j>0}\\\\lambda_j^{-s} for s large, and this is extended to all complex s by analytic continuation. The zeta regularized determinant of the Laplacian acting on i-forms is :\\\\Delta_i=\\\\exp(-\\\\zeta^\\\\prime_i(0)) which is formally the product of the positive eigenvalues of the laplacian acting on i-forms. The analytic torsion T(M,E) is defined to be :T(M,E) = \\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\sum_i (-1)^ii \\\\zeta^\\\\prime_i(0)/2\\\\right) = \\\\prod_i\\\\Delta_i^{-(-1)^ii/2}. Definition of Reidemeister torsion Let X be a finite connected CW-complex with fundamental group \\\\pi := \\\\pi_1(X) and universal cover {\\\\tilde X}, and let U be an orthogonal finite-dimensional \\\\pi-representation. Suppose that :H^\\\\pi_n(X;U) := H_n(U \\\\otimes_{\\\\mathbf{Z}[\\\\pi]} C_*({\\\\tilde X})) = 0 for all n. If we fix a cellular basis for C_*({\\\\tilde X}) and an orthogonal \\\\mathbf{R}-basis for U, then D_* := U \\\\otimes_{\\\\mathbf{Z}[\\\\pi]} C_*({\\\\tilde X}) is a contractible finite based free \\\\mathbf{R}-chain complex. Let \\\\gamma_*: D_* \\\\to D_{*+1} be any chain contraction of D*, i.e. d_{n+1} \\\\circ \\\\gamma_n + \\\\gamma_{n-1} \\\\circ d_n = id_{D_n} for all n. We obtain an isomorphism (d_* + \\\\gamma_*)_\\\\text{odd}: D_\\\\text{odd} \\\\to D_\\\\text{even} with D_\\\\text{odd} := \\\\oplus_{n \\\\, odd} \\\\, D_n, D_\\\\text{even} := \\\\oplus_{n \\\\, \\\\text{even}} \\\\, D_n. We define the Reidemeister torsion :\\\\rho(X;U) := \\\\det(A)^{-1} \\\\in \\\\mathbf{R}^{>0} where A is the matrix of (d_* + \\\\gamma_*)_\\\\text{odd} with respect to the given bases. The Reidemeister torsion \\\\rho(X;U) is independent of the choice of the cellular basis for C_*({\\\\tilde X}), the orthogonal basis for U and the chain contraction \\\\gamma_*. Let M be a compact smooth manifold, and let \\\\rho\\\\colon\\\\pi(M)\\\\rightarrow GL(E) be a unimodular representation. M has a smooth triangulation. For any choice of a volume \\\\mu\\\\in\\\\det H_*(M), we get an invariant \\\\tau_M(\\\\rho:\\\\mu)\\\\in\\\\mathbf{R}^+. Then we call the positive real number \\\\tau_M(\\\\rho:\\\\mu) the Reidemeister torsion of the manifold M with respect to \\\\rho and \\\\mu. A short history of Reidemeister torsion Reidemeister torsion was first used to combinatorially classify 3-dimensional lens spaces in by Reidemeister, and in higher-dimensional spaces by Franz. The classification includes examples of homotopy equivalent 3-dimensional manifolds which are not homeomorphic ‚Äî at the time (1935) the classification was only up to PL homeomorphism, but later showed that this was in fact a classification up to homeomorphism. J. H. C. Whitehead defined the \\"torsion\\" of a homotopy equivalence between finite complexes. This is a direct generalization of the Reidemeister, Franz, and de Rham concept; but is a more delicate invariant. Whitehead torsion provides a key tool for the study of combinatorial or differentiable manifolds with nontrivial fundamental group and is closely related to the concept of \\"simple homotopy type\\", see In 1960 Milnor discovered the duality relation of torsion invariants of manifolds and show that the (twisted) Alexander polynomial of knots is the Reidemister torsion of its knot complement in S^3. For each q the Poincar√© duality P_o induces :P_o\\\\colon\\\\operatorname{det}(H_q(M))\\\\overset{\\\\sim}{\\\\,\\\\longrightarrow\\\\,}(\\\\operatorname{det}(H_{n-q}(M)))^{-1} and then we obtain :\\\\Delta(t)=\\\\pm t^n\\\\Delta(1/t). The representation of the fundamental group of knot complement plays a central role in them. It gives the relation between knot theory and torsion invariants. Cheeger‚ÄìM√ºller theorem Let (M,g) be an orientable compact Riemann manifold of dimension n and \\\\rho\\\\colon \\\\pi(M)\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathop{GL}(E) a representation of the fundamental group of M on a real vector space of dimension N. Then we can define the de Rham complex :\\\\Lambda^0\\\\stackrel{d_0}{\\\\longrightarrow}\\\\Lambda^1\\\\stackrel{d_1}{\\\\longrightarrow}\\\\cdots\\\\stackrel{d_{n-1}}{\\\\longrightarrow}\\\\Lambda^n and the formal adjoint d_p and \\\\delta_p due to the flatness of E_q. As usual, we also obtain the Hodge Laplacian on p-forms :\\\\Delta_p=\\\\delta_{p+1} d_p+d_{p-1}\\\\delta_{p}. Assuming that \\\\partial M=0, the Laplacian is then a symmetric positive semi-positive elliptic operator with pure point spectrum :0\\\\le\\\\lambda_0\\\\le\\\\lambda_1\\\\le\\\\cdots\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty. As before, we can therefore define a zeta function associated with the Laplacian \\\\Delta_q on \\\\Lambda^q(E) by :\\\\zeta_q(s;\\\\rho)=\\\\sum_{\\\\lambda_j >0}\\\\lambda_j^{-s}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\Gamma(s)}\\\\int^\\\\infty_0 t^{s-1}\\\\text{Tr}(e^{-t\\\\Delta_q} - P_q)dt,\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\text{Re}(s)>\\\\frac{n}{2} where P is the projection of L^2 \\\\Lambda(E) onto the kernel space \\\\mathcal{H}^q(E) of the Laplacian \\\\Delta_q. It was moreover shown by that \\\\zeta_q(s;\\\\rho) extends to a meromorphic function of s\\\\in\\\\mathbf{C} which is holomorphic at s=0. As in the case of an orthogonal representation, we define the analytic torsion T_M(\\\\rho;E) by :T_M(\\\\rho;E) = \\\\exp\\\\biggl(\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sum^n_{q=0}(-l)^qq\\\\frac{d}{ds}\\\\zeta_q(s;\\\\rho)\\\\biggl_{s=0}\\\\biggr). In 1971 D.B. Ray and I.M. Singer conjectured that T_M(\\\\rho;E)=\\\\tau_M(\\\\rho;\\\\mu) for any unitary representation \\\\rho. This Ray‚ÄìSinger conjecture was eventually proved, independently, by and . Both approaches focus on the logarithm of torsions and their traces. This is easier for odd-dimensional manifolds than in the even-dimensional case, which involves additional technical difficulties. This Cheeger‚ÄìM√ºller theorem (that the two notions of torsion are equivalent), along with Atiyah‚ÄìPatodi‚ÄìSinger theorem, later provided the basis for Chern‚ÄìSimons perturbation theory. A proof of the Cheeger-M√ºller theorem for arbitrary representations was later given by J. M. Bismut and Weiping Zhang. Their proof uses the Witten deformation.

The Vegetarian Crusade: The Rise of an American Reform Movement, 1817-1921. University of North Carolina Press. pp. 177-179. By 1913, the Guild reported 200 members. The goal of the organization was to \\"teach the foremost among the unnecessary evils of the world, and one which underlies most of the other evils, is the mutilation and slaughter of our fellow creatures for food and other selfish ends.\\" Curtis founded the Millennium Food Company to produce meat substitutes and non-animal foods. Its most successful product was Bakon Yeast, made from hickory smoke. After Freshel died her husband Curtis controlled the Guild and after his death the organization was directed by Pegeen Fitzgerald.  Design career  Mrs. Freshel is traditionally held to be responsible for the original designs of the Wisteria and Pond Lily Tiffany lamps that won the grand prize at the 1902 Prima Exposizione d‚ÄôArte Decoration Moderna in Turin, Italy. In 1900, she commissioned Louis Comfort Tiffany to decorate her home in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts. Included in her sketches was a lampshade modeled after the wisteria that grew there. It is presumed that she exchanged the commercial rights to the design for a reduced fee on the work. However, the recent discovery of Clara Driscoll's letters suggests instead that Driscoll may have been responsible for the Wisteria design. She designed a Swiss chalet style house for her neighbors Mr. and Mrs. John G. \\"Jack\\" Ramsbottom at 86 Commonwealth Avenue in Chestnut Hill. This and her own Tudor style house at 74 were acquired and gutted by Boston College and known as the Philomatheia Club and Alumni Hall, respectively.

There she remained for fifty years and studied ornithology, palaeontology, geology and anatomy. She was a piece-worker, paid by the number of fossils she prepared. In 1901 Bate published her first scientific paper, \\"A short account of a bone cave in the Carboniferous limestone of the Wye valley\\", which appeared in the Geological Magazine, about bones of small Pleistocene mammals. The same year, she visited Cyprus, staying for 18 months at her own expense, to search for bones there, finding twelve new deposits in ossiferous caves, among them bones of the species Hippopotamus minor. In 1902, with the benefit of a hard-won grant from the Royal Society, she discovered in a cave in the Kyrenia hills a new species of dwarf elephant, which she named Elephas cypriotes, later described in a paper for the Royal Society.Bate, Dorothy M. A.: Preliminary Note on the Discovery of a Pigmy Elephant in the Pleistocene of Cyprus in Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Vol. 71 (1902‚Äì1903), pp. 498‚Äì500Dorothea Bate, Cyprus work diary 1901‚Äì02, 3 volumes, Natural History Museum's earth sciences library, palaeontology MSS While in Cyprus she also observed‚Äîand trapped, shot and skinnedMaking no bones about hunting fossils at telegraph.co.uk dated 4 July 2005 (accessed 5 March 2013)‚Äîliving mammals and birds and prepared a number of other papers, including descriptions of the Cyprus Spiny Mouse (Acomys nesiotes) and a subspecies of the Eurasian Wren (Troglodytes troglodytes cypriotes). She later undertook expeditions to many other Mediterranean islands, including Crete, Corsica, Sardinia, Malta, and the Balearic Islands, publishing work on their prehistoric fauna. In the Balearics in 1909, she discovered Myotragus balearicus, a previously unknown species of the subfamily Caprinae. On the plateau of Kat, in eastern Crete, she found remains of the Cretan dwarf hippopotamus.Evans, Arthur: The Early Nilotic, Libyan and Egyptian Relations with Minoan Crete in The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland Vol. 55, Jul. ‚Äì Dec. 1925 (Jul. ‚Äì Dec. 1925), pp. 199‚Äì228 In Crete, she got to know the archaeologists then excavating Knossos and other sites on the island, who were throwing light on the Minoan civilisation, such as Arthur Evans. Finding herself sexually harassed by the British Vice-Consul in Majorca, Bate commented: \\"I do hate old men who try to make love to one and ought not to in their official positions.\\"Shindler, Karolyn: Discovering Dorothea: the Life of the Pioneering Fossil-Hunter Dorothea Bate (2005) According to The Daily Telegraph ‚Äì In the late 1920s Bate travelled to the British ruled Palestine. She was in her late 40s and well respected. Bates had been invited by Dorothy Garrod, who later became Cambridge University's first female professor and who had been put in charge of an excavation in Haifa by the British military governor. In Bethlehem Bates and Elinor Wight Gardner discovered an extinct elephant species, an early horse and a prehistoric giant tortoise. They also discovered evidence that animals had been hunted by Bethlehem's first human inhabitants. In the 1930s Bate studied the animal bones Garrod had excavated in the Mount Carmel caves, which contained a succession of Upper Pleistocene levels. Instead of just inferring climatic conditions from the presence or absence of cold- or -warm loving animals, she was an early pioneer of the approach to take large samples of fauna of a succession of archaeological strata. These provided a series of plots. Bate worked on the basis that alterations in the frequency of species of animal hunted by early man reflected naturally occurring changes. This work made her an early pioneer of archaeozoology, especially in the field of climatic interpretation. Bate also worked alongside the archaeologist Professor Dorothy Garrod in the Caves of Nahal Me‚Äôarot, where excavations had commenced in 1928. She was the first to study the faunas of the area, her stated research aim being the reconstruction of the natural history of the Pleistocene (Ice Age) fauna of the Levant region. Being aware of the fossils and the numerous human occupations her study of the Carmel Caves was pioneering. She described several new species, and identified several species that had previously not been known to have existed in this area in the Pleistocene. She constructed one of the first quantitative curves of faunal succession, and in reference to ancient climate she identified a faunal break between primitive and modern mammal communities during the Middle of the Ice Age. Bate identified the shifts from deer to gazelle dominance as rooted in changes of regional vegetation and paleoclimates. She was also the first to identify a Canis familiaris to have lived in the Ice Age, based on a skull that had been found. Decades later more remains of Natufian dogs were found. Her pioneering research was published in 1937, when Bate and Garrod published The Stone Age of Mount Carmel volume 1, part 2: Palaeontology, the Fossil Fauna of the Wady el-Mughara Caves, interpreting the Mount Carmel excavations.D. A. Garrod, D. M. A. Bate, Eds., The Stone Age of Mount Carmel, Volume 1: Excavations at the Wady El-Mughara (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1937) Among other finds, they reported remains of the hippopotamus.On the Occurrence of Hippopotamus in the Iron Age of the Coastal Area of Israel (Tell Qasileh) by Georg Haas in Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research, No. 132 (Dec. 1953), pp. 30‚Äì34 Bate also worked with Percy R. Lowe on fossil ostriches in China. She compared the relative proportions of Gazella and Dama remains. Later life, death, legacy Many archaeologists and anthropologists relied on her expertise in identifying fossil bones, including Louis Leakey, Charles McBurney, and John Desmond Clark. During the Second World War, Bate transferred from the Natural History Museum's department of geology in London to its zoological branch at Tring, and in 1948, a few months short of her seventieth birthday, she was appointed officer-in-charge there. Although suffering from cancer, she died of a heart attack on 13 January 1951, and as a Christian Scientist was cremated. Her personal papers were destroyed in a house fire shortly after her death. On her desk at Tring was a list of 'Papers to write'. By the last in the list she had written Swan Song. Her estate at death amounted to ¬£15,369.Probate, granted 5 April 1951, CGPLA England & Wales In 2005, a 'Dorothea Bate facsimile' was created at the Natural History Museum as part of a project to develop notable gallery characters to patrol its display cases. She is thus among other luminaries including Carl Linnaeus, Mary Anning, and William Smith. They tell stories and anecdotes of their lives and discoveries. In her biography Discovering Dorothea: the Life of the Pioneering Fossil-Hunter Dorothea Bate, Karolyn Shindler describes Bate as \\"witty, acerbic, clever and courageous\\". Shindler is also the author of the biography in the 2004 edition of the Dictionary of National Biography.

Background Farewell Europe, by Aleksander Sochaczewski After the failure of the January Uprising in Poland in 1863-1865, the Russian empire exiled many of the Poles involved to Siberia.About 18,623 people were exiled according to Soviet sources ( Dane: Bolzhaja Sovetskaja Encoklopedija); out of them about 11,000 to Eastern Siberia ( A.Jakovec. Strana, w kotoruju ssylali. Polaki w Buriatii., Petr Kropotkin. Zapiski rewolucionera.); according to Polish sources about 39,000 were exiled; half of that number to Siberia (Stefan Kieniewicz, Powstanie Styczniowe, Warszawa, 1983, ) The insurgents had brief contacts with Siberian nationalists, who hoped for a general Siberian uprising and the establishment of the republic of Svobodoslaviya (–°–≤–æ–±–æ–¥–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤–∏—è)., They also had contact with Nikolai Serno-Solovyevich; another group supporting the insurgents was the Zemlya i Volya with activists such as Nikolai Chernyshevsky and Aleksandr Herzen. The Poles and the Russians planned a major uprising under Chernyshevsky and Walenty Lewandowski, but due to betrayal a wave of arrests disrupted their plans. Although the arrests prevented a major uprising from occurring, a group of about 700 Poles who were assigned to the construction of the Circumbaikal Highway (a road near Lake Baikal and the Mongolian border) decided to disarm the guards and escape via Mongolia to China, where they hoped to find English ships and return to Europe by way of America. The uprising The insurgents called themselves a Siberian Legion of Free Poles (Syberyjski Legion Wolnych Polak√≥w). Numbering about 700 people and led by Narcyz Celi≈Ñski and Gustaw Szaramowicz they attacked the nearby units of Russian Army, starting with their escort of 138 soldiers. They liberated other small groups of prisoners and raided local institutions such as the post office. However some of the Russian soldiers (Cossacks) taken captive managed to escape and alerted the governor-general in Irkutsk. A major mobilization of Russian forces in Siberia occurred, with many thousands of troops converging on the insurgents. The insurgents split, with Celi≈Ñski trying to evade the enemy forces and Szaramowicz trying to break through them. Some of the insurgents quickly surrendered, particularly those who were content with the partial amnesty and reduction of sentences they received in the aftermath of an assassination attempt on Alexander II of Russia in April that year. On 28 June the rest, commanded by Szaramowicz, were defeated at the battle of Mishikha (Miszychna, –ú–∏—à–∏—Ö–∞). Vladimir Polomoshin Ne zginela Polska Aftermath Most of the insurgents were either killed or captured. Virtually none escaped, although some were taken prisoner weeks after the uprising started. All of the 400 survivors had their sentences increased, and four of the leaders were to be executed (in addition to Celi≈Ñski and Szaramowicz, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kotkowski and Jakub Reiner). They were allowed to write letters to their families, but they were never delivered, as the delivery was stopped by a personal order from tsar Alexander II of Russia. They were executed on 27 November 1866 near Irkutsk. Polish poet Kornel Ujejski dedicated one of his poems to this event. Na zgon rozstrzelanych w Irkucku A street in Irkutsk is also named after Polish insurgents.

Built in 1863‚Äì64, she became one of the longest-serving revenue cutters in the Service's history, and was the oldest active-duty ship in U.S. government service by the end of her 51-year career. Originally named Mahoning, the ship spent almost her entire career operating off the coasts of Maine and Massachusetts, where through the course of several decades she accumulated an outstanding record for aiding ships in distress. Other highlights of her career included the foiling of a filibuster raid on Cuba in 1869, and participation in the funeral pageant of renowned philanthropist George Peabody. She also briefly served as USS Woodbury in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. After her final decommission in 1915, Levi Woodbury was placed into service as the merchant Laksco. She disappears from shipping records in 1932. Construction and design Levi Woodbury‚Äîoriginally named Mahoning after a creek and a valley in Pennsylvania‚Äîwas one of six Pawtuxet-class screw schooners ordered by the Treasury Department in 1863 for the United States Revenue Marine. Mahoning was built in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania by J. W. Lynn.\\"Mahoning, 1863\\", U.S. Coast Guard website. Among those aboard for the launch, on the afternoon of Wednesday, 29 July 1863, were \\"a number of ladies, many officers of the Philadelphia Navy Yard, and other invited guests.\\" Mahoning was christened by Miss Rebecca B.

Like the other ships of her class, her contract called for a hull of oak, locust and white oak, strengthened with diagonal iron bracing. Her two- cylinder oscillating engine drove a single 8-foot (2.4 m) diameter screw propeller. Mahonings speed is unrecorded but was probably similar to the 12 knots achieved by her sister ship USRC Kankakee. She was topsail schooner- rigged for auxiliary sail power. Mahonings armament consisted of a single 30-pounder Parrott rifle and five 24-pounder howitzers. She was crewed by a complement of seven officers and 34 enlisted men. Service history Civil War service, 1864‚Äì65 Mahoning was commissioned into the Revenue Marine on 18 July 1864. Among her first duties was the transport of a Congressional Committee in mid-August to Wiscasset, Fort Popham and Bath, Maine.\\"Affairs in Portland\\", The New York Times, 1864-08-12. On 29 September, Mahoning arrived in Boston, Massachusetts from Portland, Maine, on the same day as her sister ship Pawtuxet from New York City, and a comparative trial between the two vessels announced.\\"Naval\\", The New York Times, 1864-10-01. On 16 November, while attempting to enter the port of Castine, Maine during a gale, Mahoning was mistakenly fired upon by Battery White, which apparently mistook her for a Confederate privateer. Mahonings Captain Webster reported that the Battery fired three rounds in total, at a range of : \\"one blank cartridge and two excellent line shots [that] fell short\\". This reception persuaded the vessel to make for Seal Harbor instead.\\"United States Revenue-Cutter Mahoning\\", The New York Times, 1864-11-17.

In May 1867, the United States Congress passed a resolution authorizing Captain Webster to receive a gold medal from Sir Frederick Bruck for aiding British vessels in distress.\\"A British Medal for Capt. Webster\\", The New York Times, 1867-05-25. Foiled filibuster raid, 1869 In July 1869, Mahoning participated in the foiling of a planned filibuster raid on Cuba by \\"a motley collection of ex-officers and fanatics\\" known as the Cuban Liberators,\\"To the Manor Born\\", americanheritage.com. who had gathered on Gardiners Island, New York, in preparation for their attack. Mahoning, still under the command of Captain Webster, initially approached the island with a force of 12 marines, but it was quickly realized this force was inadequate, and an additional party of 38 marines sent for, which arrived aboard the tugboat Rocket. After locating the filibusters' camp and firing a few warning shots, the marines were able to capture most of them without incident. The captives, in a \\"dirty and disorganized condition\\" and numbering 125 in total, were then transported aboard the revenue cutter to Fort Lafayette, where they were held pending further orders from Washington.\\"Rout of the Filibusters\\", The New York Times, 1869-07-18. Peabody funeral pageant and other events, 1870‚Äì73 On Saturday 29 January 1870, Mahoning participated in ceremonies occasioned by the return from the United Kingdom of the remains of noted philanthropist George Peabody at Portland Harbor, Maine. The ceremonies began at 10:15 am when Mahoning conveyed members of the U.S. Legislature to , where they conducted an inspection of the ship and viewed Peabody's casket. The legislators then returned to Mahoning to be given a sightseeing tour of the assembled fleet from Mahonings deck. Mahoning later joined the fleet as it formed a procession to escort Peabody's casket to shore.\\"Magnificent Funeral Pageant in Portland Harbor\\", Lewiston Evening Journal, p. 3, 1870-01-29. Mahoning participated in a second ceremonial passage on Tuesday, 5 August 1872, when she escorted out of the harbor a Japanese diplomatic mission departing Boston on the Olympus.\\"Local Intelligence\\", Boston Daily Evening Transcript, p. 4, 1872-08-05. On 5 June 1873, Mahoning was renamed Levi Woodbury in honor of the Supreme Court Justice of the same name. Cable ship welcome, 1874 The cable ship Faraday. Levi Woodbury welcomed the vessel to the United States in 1874 In early June 1874, Levi Woodbury was despatched from Boston to try to locate the SS Faraday, a cable-laying ship from Britain whose appearance at Boston was behind schedule. Levi Woodbury departed Boston with a large party of about 150, including the Mayor, several ex-Mayors and other dignitaries. Thick fog however frustrated the expedition, and Levi Woodbury was obliged to return in the afternoon.\\"The New Cable\\", The New York Times, 1874-06-05. On 8 June Faraday was finally located off White Island, where she had anchored due to thick fog, and Levi Woodbury despatched to greet the vessel. The party from Levi Woodbury were warmly greeted aboard Faraday and treated to a \\"sumptuous lunch\\", after which various toasts were made celebrating the prospect of a new cable link between the two countries. A formal reception at Portland was organized the following day for Faradays officers and electricians, to which the officers of Levi Woodbury were also invited.\\"The New Cable\\", The New York Times, 1874-06-09. In December, Levi Woodbury was transferred to Eastport, Maine to take the place of revenue cutter Mosswood, which had been ordered to New York.\\"Revenue Cutter Arrival\\", Lewiston Evening Journal, p. 2, 1874-12-10. Winter patrols, 1870s‚Äì1890s Over her many years of operation from New England ports, Levi Woodbury was regularly selected for the arduous duty of winter patrolling. The purpose of these patrols, which were carried out from 1 December to 1 April each year, was to cruise off \\"dangerous points\\" of the coastline in search of ships in distress and render them appropriate assistance:\\"For the Relief of Distressed Vessels\\", The New York Times, 1895-11-27. > Many a poor mariner, with his sails blown away, ground tackle gone, leaking > badly, heavily iced up, food lockers empty, or perhaps out of his reckoning, > sights the revenue cutter in the distance bearing down upon him, and > experiences feelings which a landsman cannot understand. These patrols, authorized directly by the U.S. President, were made \\"as close to the land as the safety of the vessel will permit\\", and were as extended as possible, weather, supplies and emergencies allowing.\\"Winter Sea Patrol\\", The Day, p. 1, 1889-03-19. Preparation for the patrols began in November, with all the ship's equipment, including masts, sails, rigging, boats, tackle, steering gear, pumps etc. being carefully inspected and repaired or renewed where necessary. New towing hawsers and heaving lines would also be procured. The ship would additionally be fitted over the cutwater with an iron, V-shaped icebreaker 3/8 of an inch thick and extending 18 inches above and below the waterline, secured by a number of heavy chains. Officers would discard their normal uniforms in preference for reefer jackets, fur cap and gloves. The extent of Levi Woodburys contribution to maritime safety over this period can be gauged by the fact that she was one of only two cutters assigned to patrol the Maine coastline, and that these waters, with their \\"immense number of shoals, rocks, reefs and islands\\", combined with the \\"very strong tides, high winds, fog, vapor and ice\\" typically accounted for about four fifths of the total number of ships aided by the Revenue Cutter Service each year. For example, in 1888, of the 526 ships in distress aided by the Service during the year, 400 were assisted by the two Maine cutters. Levi Woodbury had already accumulated a \\"remarkable\\" record of assistance by 1883;\\"A Revenue Cutter Disabled\\", The New York Times, 1884-03-28. by 1892, it was being said of her that she had \\"battled with more ice\\"‚Äîand by extension, assisted more ships in distress‚Äîthan any other steamer on the Eastern seaboard.\\"The Old 'Kate' and Her Scrapes, and the Late E. P. Lansil\\", Lewiston Evening Journal, 1892-01-28. Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, 1898 Woodbury at the Norfolk Navy Yard, shortly before her deployment to Havana during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War With the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War on the horizon, Levi Woodbury was ordered to join the U.S. Navy's North Atlantic Fleet on 24 March. Two days later, she received orders to report to Norfolk, Virginia, arriving there 2 April. She subsequently participated in operations with the North Atlantic Fleet from 8 May to the end of hostilities in August, during which time she was referred to simply as Woodbury in naval records. Though Woodbury may have participated in troop convoys to Cuba, her primary duty in this period consisted of blockading the port of Havana. She took no prizes during her brief naval career and appears to have been involved in no engagements. Control of the cutter was returned to the Treasury Department on 17 August 1898. She seems to have retained the name Woodbury in Revenue Service records following the transfer.See for example the USCGC Annual Reports mentioned below. Later service After the war, Woodbury returned to her former base at Portland, Maine, on 16 November to resume patrols of the New England coast. That routine occupied her for the next 17 years. On 18 July, 1904 she was involved in a minor collision with in the harbor at Portland, Maine due to excessive speed in dense fog by the cutter resulting in 1,200 in damage to the steamer. By 1912, her armament had been upgraded to a single rapid-fire 3-pounder. She also carried a 250 watt radio.Annual Report 1912, p. 70. By 1913, Woodbury was not only the Coast Guard's oldest cutter, she was the oldest active-duty vessel in U.S. government service, as well as being the only ship to have seen active service in both the American Civil War and the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War.Annual Report 1913, p. 62. Despite her age, she was still able to perform useful service. On 10 January 1913, for example, the crew of Woodbury were able to effect temporary repairs to their ship's broken rudder to go to the aid of the steamer Monhegan, which, after breaking down on the Maine coast, was being driven to destruction by a gale. Woodbury was able to get a line to the stricken vessel and tow it to safety, albeit at the stately pace of 3 knots.Annual Report 1913, p. 42. In spite of such admirable efforts, however, Woodbury was clearly an obsolete ship, and in barely serviceable condition due to rotting timbers and worn out boilers.Annual Report 1913, p. 80. In 1913, the Revenue Cutter Service succeeded in its request to Congress for a replacement vessel, which was slated to enter service in 1915. Woodbury achieved one of her last triumphs when on 7 August 1914, \\"in one of the most important ... [rescue] incidents of the year\\", she towed to safety the steamer Bay State, which, with 250 passengers and a crew of 104, had run aground \\"in a very exposed position\\" at Portland Head.Annual Report 1915, p. 7. A little under a year later, on 19 July 1915, Woodbury was placed out of commission, a few months after the creation of the United States Coast Guard, and a few days before the commission of her $225,000 replacement .Annual Report 1915, p. 34. Woodburys decommission ended a remarkable 51 years with the Revenue Cutter Service, making her one of the longest serving cutters in the organization's history. Levi Woodbury was sold on 10 August to Thomas Butler & Co., of Boston, Massachusetts, and later entered service as the merchant Laksco. She disappears from shipping records in 1932.Silverstone, p. 188. See also References Bibliography * Silverstone, Paul H.

His father, James Guy, had also been a Senator. Guy was elected to the Division of Bass in the Tasmanian House of Assembly in 1916 and was part of Joseph Lyons' cabinet when Labor came to power in 1923. He served as Chief Secretary (1923‚Äì28), Minister for Mines (1923‚Äì24), Minister for Railways (1924‚Äì28), and Deputy Premier. Lyons was severely injured in a car accident in July 1926, and Guy was acting premier for four months in his absence. Michael O'Keefe, the Speaker of the House of Assembly, was killed in the same accident. When Labor lost the 1928 election, Guy became Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He remained in the Tasmanian parliament until 1929. In 1929 he contested and won the Federal Division of Bass for Labor and joined James Scullin's government. In 1931 he joined Joseph Lyons, James Fenton and two other Labor members in forming the United Australia Party along with the Nationalist Party of Australia opposition, which came to office in December with Lyons as prime minister. In 1932 Lyons rewarded him for his loyalty by appointing him assistant Minister for Trade and Customs. One of Guy's responsibilities was to defend film- censorship provisions which he described as 'both necessary and admirable', for, without them, 'all sorts of puerile and undesirable films could be displayed, to the detriment, not only of our civilization, but of the Christian religion'. After losing his seat in the 1934 election, Guy contested it unsuccessfully in 1937, and then the Division of Wilmot unsuccessfully in 1939, before winning it in 1940. He represented Wilmot for the UAP until 1944 and for the Liberal Party until 1946. In 1949 he was elected to the Australian Senate as a Liberal, where he remained until being defeated in the 1956 election.

He served as Minister for Repatriation in the Chifley Government from 1946 to 1949. His son Lance Barnard also entered federal politics and served as Deputy Prime Minister of Australia in the 1970s. Early life Barnard was born at Mole Creek, Tasmania and was educated at Invermay State School, but left school at 14. In 1909 he began working for Tasmanian Government Railways, first as an engine cleaner and eventually as a driver. In March 1912 he married Martha Melva McKenzie and they raised three sons and a daughter in East Launceston. In 1920 he helped found the Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen. Federal politics Barnard stood unsuccessfully at the 1931 election as the Australian Labor Party candidate for the seat of Bass in the Australian House of Representatives. In 1933, he became state secretary of the party and at the 1934 election he won Bass. From 1941 to 1946, he was chairman of the joint parliamentary committee on social security, which developed much of the Curtin and Chifley governments' social policy agenda. In November 1946, he was appointed Minister for Repatriation in the second Chifley Ministry. Although one of his sons was killed in the war and the other two were injured, he was under constant attack from service organisations and others for not delivering more for war veterans and, like his predecessor, Charles Frost, in 1946, he lost his seat at the 1949 election.

Friant was born in the Montmartre district of Paris. His father was a principal ballet dancer, and his grandfather a professor of ballet at the Paris Op√©ra. While a boy, Charles Friant sang in the opera chorus, and appeared in the premiere of Vincent d'Indy‚Äôs opera L'Etranger in 1902. Friant attended ballet school in Paris from 1901-1906. He met his wife to be, Mademoiselle Mougot, at the ballet school where she taught an acting course in which Friant enrolled. He then trained as an actor with Sarah Bernhardt, joining her company touring Europe 1908-1909. This included performing opposite Bernhardt in Edmond Rostand‚Äôs L'Aiglon. In 1910 it was discovered he had a tenor voice, and he went to the Conservatoire de Paris to study singing with noted baritone L√©on Melchiss√©dec. On graduating in 1914, he was awarded a first prize in singing as a pupil of Alphonse Leduc Hettich and a first prize in op√©ra-comique as a student of Melchis√©dec. His operatic debut, postponed by illness and World War I was as Spakos in the first French performance of Jules Massenet‚Äôs Cl√©op√¢tre at the Th√©√¢tre Lyrique du Vaudeville. One notice stated \\"here is a young tenor of whom it is possible to expect much, especially if he improves his enunciation\\". Between 1918-1919 he sang at Grenoble's Grand Th√©√¢tre. Friant became a principal tenor of the Op√©ra comique from 1920-1939. His debut at that company, at the Salle Favart, was on 4 February 1920 in the title role of Massenet's opera Werther. Werther became one of his signature roles. He was immediately acclaimed as an extraordinary singer. Friant had a wide repertory, including the title role in Henri Rabaud‚Äôs Marouf, Le Chevalier des Grieux in Manon, G√©rald in Lakm√©, Jean in Le jongleur de Notre Dame (another signature role), Canio in Pagliacci, Cavaradossi in Tosca, and Don Jos√© in Carmen. With his acting ability, he was often chosen to create roles in new operas. He sang in the premieres of Le roi Candaule by Alfred Bruneau (as Gyg√®s); and Le Bon Roi Dagobert (as Dagobert), La Hulla (as Nars√®s), Deux sous de fleurs by Ralph Benatzky, Mandrin by Joseph Szulc (as Antoine), and the title role in Tarass-Boulba by Marcel Louis Auguste Samuel- Rousseau. Other works of his day he was chosen for included le Prince Charmant in Louis Aubert‚Äôs La For√™t Bleue and Raphael in Charles Levad√©‚Äôs La Peau de chagrin. Besides Grenoble and Paris Friant also sang at the casino in Biarritz, the Th√©√¢tre Royal de La Monnaie in Brussels, the Op√©ra de Marseille, and the Nice Opera. Friant appeared at the Algiers Opera (now the Th√©√¢tre National Alg√©rien) in the 1926/1927 season in Manon, Tosca, Werther, and Le jongleur de Notre Dame; and in the 1931/32 season in La Peau de chagrin. His final performance was at the Op√©ra de Monte-Carlo on 2 February 1946 in Carmen in the supporting role of Le Danca√Øre. He never sang at the Paris Op√©ra. He died after a long illness at age 57 in Paris. He has been described as a lyric tenor of surpassing sensitivity. Friant was known for his quick vibrato, articulation and exquisite phrasing. He made each of the characters he portrayed unforgettable. His use of dynamics reached deeply, touching his listeners with more than just the beauty of his voice. Due to his training Friant possessed not only an expressive voice but also a ballet dancer's movement and an actor‚Äôs sense of gesture. In a review of some of his recordings, William Ashbrook wrote: \\"For those who think singing is all beautifully rounded tones, Friant will never make the top twenty, but for listeners who respond to deeply felt dramatic expression he will always be regarded as a cherishable artist\\". His was a style of classic French singing that died out after World War II. Friant made acoustical recordings for Path√© and the Compagnie Fran√ßaise du Gramophone and electrical recordings for Od√©on. He was featured in EMI‚Äôs The Record of Singing volume 2 (1914-1925) ‚ÄúThe French Tradition in Decline‚Äù.

Torrance Memorial Medical Center is a Magnet designated facility recognized by the American Nurse Credentialing Center (ANCC) for quality patient care, nursing excellence and innovations in professional nursing practice. Torrance Memorial was the first hospital in the Los Angeles South Bay region, and is currently one of just three burn centers in Los Angeles County.  History  Torrance Memorial was founded by the estate of Jared Sidney Torrance in 1925. Throughout the Great Depression, the hospital operated as a non-profit, providing essential care services to the South Bay area. During this time, the hospital was primarily sustained by Mr. Torrance‚Äôs wife, Helena Childs Torrance, who donated hospital equipment, supplies, and funds. Over the first decade of operation, Torrance Memorial staff provided care to 10,711 patients and delivered 1,701 babies. In 1947, an additional wing was added to the hospital, along with 23 more beds, all of which were immediately occupied. That same year, Torrance Memorial was rated Class A by the American College of Surgeons, becoming the first of its kind in the region. Torrance Memorial was a local leader in the uniform revolt, allowing nurses to wear colored pantsuits as uniforms, rather than the traditional white dress. In 1967, Torrance Memorial merged with the smaller Riviera Community Hospital. The hospital moved to its current site (adjacent to Zamperini Field, the Torrance municipal airport) in 1971. In 1973, the hospital opened a laminar airflow room, which was a new technology that provided high-level sterility for surgical procedures, including open-heart surgery, hip replacements, and neurosurgical procedures. Torrance Memorial was the first hospital in the South Bay to provide ultrasound technology to patients and opened South Bay's first blood donor center. In the 1980s, the hospital began operating as a base station for Los Angeles County paramedics, acquired a CT scanner, and installed the area's first in-house MRI machine. An Intensive Care Newborn Nursery was opened in 1986, with 12 beds for special medical care and nursing for infants. In 1989, Torrance Memorial installed a computer system called SIDNe, which gave staff an easier method of tracking patient information. Throughout the '90s, Torrance Memorial was recognized by numerous performance awards, including selection as a \\"Top 100 Hospital.\\" The effort to define the hospital's values culminated in a handbook, published in 1996. The Media Service Department began producing a half-hour informational television show, HealthBeat, on local cable channels in 1998. In 2000, Torrance Memorial once again showed its innovation, this time leading the region in molecular imaging technology by installing a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanner to map cancer and heart conditions. In May 2017, it was announced that Torrance Memorial Medical Center along with the Marina Del Rey Hospital will formally affiliate with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center under the new parent organization, Cedars-Sinai Health System.

MMC Report Tooke led the inquiry into Modernising Medical Careers (MMC), the new and current post-graduate training structure for medical doctors in the UK. MMC has become extremely unpopular amongst the majority of medical professionals in the UK, and as a result the Government set up an independent inquiry into the situation. Tooke's report strongly criticises the UK Government's handling of the MMC implementation. The \\"Tooke report\\" suggests scrapping MMC and starting with a new system which is based on extensive consultation with medical professional bodies and practitioners. Tooke's report has been uniformly welcomed by the medical establishment, the majority of whom are keen to bury MMC. Despite the widespread acknowledgement that the Tooke report addresses several flaws in the government's reforms of medical training, the UK Department of Health's response to the Tooke report suggests that the department does not want to see it fully implemented. The Department's response accepts only a quarter of the Tooke review's recommendations, and attempts to resist the remainder in varying degrees.Department of Health response This response is regarded as inadequate by many in the UK medical professions.

Forming part of a major link between Liverpool and the industrial heartlands of the Midlands, the canal was opened in 1835, and merged with the Ellesmere and Chester Canal Company in 1845, which became the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company in the following year. History The canal was authorised by an Act of Parliament in 1825. It was to serve as a link between the industrial Midlands and the Port of Liverpool. The project engineer was Thomas Telford, who faced a number of engineering problems during construction, but the canal was finally finished in 1835. It was built as a narrow canal, for boats with a maximum width of 7 ft (2.1m). At its northern end, the canal joined the Ellesmere and Chester Canal, just above the Chester Canal's basin at Nantwich. At the southern end, it joined the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal at Autherley Junction near Wolverhampton, which provided access to the Birmingham network of canals. The length of the canal was 39 miles (62 km) and it required 26 locks to drop the 176 ft (53.7m) from Autherley to Nantwich. These were mainly concentrated in flights, with five locks at Tyrley, another five at Adderley, fifteen at Audlem and two at Hack Green. A stop lock reduced the flow of water between the canals at Autherley Junction, and the main supply of water was from the Belvide Reservoir, on the initial section near to where the canal crossed Watling Street (now the A5 road) on an aqueduct. This was not adequate, and so in 1836 it was doubled in size; it now has a capacity of 70 million cubic metres. This was later supplemented by the outflow from the Barnhurst sewage treatment works which was built near Autherley Junction, to serve the people of Wolverhampton. The company worked closely with the Ellesmere and Chester Canal Company, which owned the canals from Ellesmere Port to Chester and from Chester to Nantwich, in a bid to maintain their profits against competition from the railways. This led to the company being taken over by the Ellesmere and Chester Canal Company in 1845, and the following year the joint company became the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company, by an Act of Parliament which also authorised the taking over of a number of other canals.Shropshire Routes to Roots: Section 8 In 1847, the new Company agreed to the terms of a lease from the London and North Western Railway Company, and so lost its independence after little more than a year, but continued to manage the canals under its control.Shropshire Routes to Roots: Section 9 Operation Despite its rural character, the canal was an important route for trade between two major centres, and so remained profitable long after many canals had become uneconomic. When most of the Shropshire Union system was closed by an Act of Abandonment in 1944, the former Birmingham and Liverpool section and the route onwards to Ellesmere Port remained open, as it was still an important carrier of metal and oil products, and remained so until the mid-1960s. The rural character of the canal is now one of its greatest assets, in the age of pleasure cruising and boating holidays.

The album was recorded immediately upon Estrada signing onto RockSTAR Music Corp in 2007 and slowly released three successful singles within that year: \\"Insataible\\", \\"Ix-Nay\\", and \\"Unlove You\\". Most of the lyrical concepts focus on different stages of relationship and heartbreak. The album's musical range is predominately pop, mixed with elements of rock, urban contemporary and R&B.;. Reception Upon its release, Elise Estrada received generally positive reviews from most critics and has since earned Estrada several accolades, including a nomination for Best R&B;/Soul Recording of the Year in the 2009 Juno Awards. The album peaked at number 98 on the Canadian Album Chart, becoming the only charting album by Estrada. The album produced two number one singles on Canada Top 40: \\"Insatiable\\" for six consecutive weeks and \\"Unlove You\\". \\"Unlove You\\" also became Estrada's most successful single on the Canadian Billboard Hot 100, reaching the Top 20 spot at number 11.

Biography Laverdi√®re was born in Ch√¢teau-Richer, East of Quebec City, on 23 October 1826. His parents, Charles Cauchon, dit Laverdi√®re (Laverdi√®re never used Cauchon as his family name) and Th√©otiste Cauchon, were farmers. He studied at the S√©minaire de Qu√©bec from 1840 onward, and proved brilliant, being promoted to assistant professor of physics and collaborating to the foundation of the student newspaper, through which he published several collections of canticles. He was ordained in 1851. Laverdi√®re never did any parish duty, and would dedicate his life to teaching and scholarly work. Soon after his ordination he was officially appointed to the Seminary, and taught there until he was appointed to the chair of history at Universit√© Laval in 1863, succeeding to Jean-Baptiste-Antoine Ferland (who had just been promoted to dean of the faculty, and died in 1865). In the meantime and in addition to his teaching duties at the seminary, he acted as de facto deputy librarian at the university and, in 1858, actual librarian. Laverdi√®re also had an interest in archeology, though he worked relatively little in that area. Laverdi√®re published a number of works that are recognized for their outstanding quality. He participated in the 1858 publication of the Relations des J√©suites de la Nouvelle-France, for which he contributed a synoptic table of contents. His 1869 Histoire du Canada was used until the end of the century, and was described as \\"very accurate in relation to the historical knowledge of the time\\", but \\"severely judged from a pedagogical and literary point of view\\". It is a rare example of a French- Canadian school manual directly touting its nihil obstat. That same year he edited the second volume of Ferland's Cours d'histoire du Canada. His major works, however, remain the 1870 annotated edition of the compiled works of Samuel de Champlain. ≈íuvres de Champlain attracted considerable attention, and is still considered an important work, although Laverdi√®re's opinion that the Jesuits had falsified the 1632 edition of Champlain remains controversial. Laverdi√®re's other major work was the edition, in collaboration with Henri- Raymond Casgrain, of the Journal des J√©suites. When most prints of an early edition of that work were destroyed, Laverdi√®re commented that it would merely mean that some misprints could be corrected for the next printing. He was abruptly stricken by apoplexy while discussing details of a new edition at a printing house on 10 March 1873. An almost obsessive attention to detail (he could spend an entire day checking a single fact) marked Laverdi√®re's work. An amiable man \\"of medium height, with keen black eyes, tanned complexion and square shoulders,\\" he devoted his life to historical scholarship. His work, alongside that of other historians of the time like Narcisse-Eutrope Dionne and Louis-Philippe Turcotte, marked a revival of interest for history in late 19th century Quebec. Laverdi√®re's papers are part of the collections of the Mus√©e de la Civilisation.

Early life Green was born in Fauquier County, Virginia. In 1836 he and his young bride moved to Lewis County, Missouri where he and his brothers established a sawmill. He became a prominent Democrat and Judge of the Lewis County Court. His brother was Missouri's Democratic Party United States Senator James S. Green. Civil War At the outbreak of the war in 1861, Green was a leading secessionist in Northeast Missouri. Following a July 4 riot at Canton, Missouri Judge Green summoned pro-Southern citizens to a training camp on the Fabius River under the auspices of the district's Missouri State Guard. He formed this mass into a cavalry regiment and Joseph C. Porter served as the lieutenant colonel. Green went on the offensive in Northeast Missouri attempting to scatter David Moore's Union Home Guard regiment. Green's much larger force included some artillery and struck Moore at Athens. Green's raw recruits were repulsed and retreated from the field. Green and his regiment participated in the successful attack on Lexington in September 1861 and at the defeat at Pea Ridge (or Elkhorn Tavern), March 1862. They also were present at the defeats at Iuka and Corinth. Promotion and death Green was commissioned a Confederate States brigadier general from July 21, 1862. He commanded a brigade of Bowen's Division in the Siege of Vicksburg. During the siege he was slightly wounded on June 25, 1863. On June 27, 1863 he was struck in the head and killed by a bullet from a Federal sharpshooter. According to the NPS Confederate Soldier listing at Vicksburg, a footnote remarks he was interred at the George Marshall Lot; reportedly he is buried in Grave # 542 Cedar Hill Cemetery (Vicksburg, Mississippi).

Plot summary On Christmas Eve, department store owner Ben Weaver insists Andy jail moonshiner Sam Muggins. Weaver has brought along a jug of moonshine as evidence of Sam's wrongdoing. Andy complies with Weaver's request but feels it's only fair that Sam's wife Bess and his two young children be incarcerated as well, since they all had knowledge of Sam's moonshining. With the Muggins family in jail, Andy, Barney, Aunt Bee, Ellie, and Opie have their planned Christmas party relocated to the Sheriff's office, bringing a holiday feast with all the trimmings for the family and a Christmas tree to decorate. Peeping at the window, Ben Weaver is touched with the Christmas spirit and tries to get himself arrested in order to join the fun. However, Weaver's initial efforts are unsuccessful due to the others' well-meaning efforts to keep him out of jail on Christmas. Andy only arrests Weaver, finally, after he dumps a garbage can in the alley and the sheriff realizes just what Ben is trying to do.

Independence requires integrity and an objective approach to the audit process. The concept requires the auditor to carry out his or her work freely and in an objective manner. Independence of the internal auditor means independence from parties whose interests might be harmed by the results of an audit. Specific internal management issues are inadequate risk management, inadequate internal controls, and poor governance. The Charter of Audit and the reporting to an Audit Committee generally provides independence from management, the code of ethics of the company (and of the Internal Audit profession) helps give guidance on independence form suppliers, clients, third parties, etc. Independence of the external auditor means independence from parties that have an interest in the results published in financial statements of an entity. The support from and relation to the Audit Committee of the client company, the contract and the contractual reference to public accounting standards/codes generally provides independence from management, the code of ethics of the Public Accountant profession) helps give guidance on independence form suppliers, clients, third parties... Internal and external concerns are convoluted when nominally independent divisions of a firm provide auditing and consulting services.Bob Vause: Guide to Analysing Companies, Fifth Edition; Bloomberg Press, 2009 The Sarbanes- Oxley Act of 2002 is a legal reaction to such problems. This article mostly deals with the independence of the statutory auditor (commonly called external auditor). For the independence of the Internal Audit, see Chief audit executive, articles \\"Independent attitude\\" and \\"organisational independence\\", or organizational independence analysed by the IIA. The purpose of an audit is to enhance the credibility of financial statements by providing written reasonable assurance from an independent source that they present a true and fair view in accordance with an accounting standard. This objective will not be met if users of the audit report believe that the auditor may have been influenced by other parties, more specifically company managers/directors or by conflicting interests (e.g. if the auditor owns shares in the company to be audited). In addition to technical competence, auditor independence is the most important factor in establishing the credibility of the audit opinion. Auditor independence is commonly referred to as the cornerstone of the auditing profession since it is the foundation of the public's trust in the accounting profession.Lindberg, D.L. & Beck, F.D., 2004. Before and After Enron: CPAs' Views on Auditor Independence. The CPA Journal Online. Since 2000, a wave of high-profile accounting scandals have cast the profession into the limelight, negatively affecting the public perception of auditor independence. Types of independence There are three main ways in which the auditor's independence can manifest itself.Mautz, R.K. & Sharaf, H.A. (1961) ‚ÄòThe Philosophy of Auditing‚Äô, American Accounting AssociationDunn, J., 1996. Auditing Theory and Practice. 2nd ed. Prentice Hall. * Programming independence * Investigative independence * Reporting independence Programming independence essentially protects the auditor's ability to select the most appropriate strategy when conducting an audit. Auditors must be free to approach a piece of work in whatever manner they consider best. As a client company grows and conducts new activities, the auditor's approach will likely have to adapt to account for these. In addition, the auditing profession is a dynamic one, with new techniques constantly being developed and upgraded which the auditor may decide to use. The strategy/proposed methods which the auditors intends to implement cannot be inhibited in any way. While programming independence protects auditors‚Äô ability to select appropriate strategies, investigative independence protects the auditor's ability to implement the strategies in whatever manner they consider necessary. Basically, auditors must have unlimited access to all company information. Any queries regarding a company's business and accounting treatment must be answered by the company. The collection of audit evidence is an essential process, and cannot be restricted in any way by the client company. Reporting independence protects the auditors‚Äô ability to choose to reveal to the public any information they believe should be disclosed. If company directors have been misleading shareholders by falsifying accounting information, they will strive to prevent the auditors from reporting this. It is in situations like this when auditor independence is most likely to be compromised. Real independence and perceived independence There are two important aspects to independence which must be distinguished from each other: independence in fact (real independence) and independence in appearance (perceived independence). Together, both forms are essential to achieve the goals of independence. Real independence refers to independence of the auditor, also known as independence of mind. More specifically, real independence concerns the state of mind an auditor is in, and how the auditor acts in/deals with a specific situation. An auditor who is independent 'in fact' has the ability to make independent decisions even if there is a perceived lack of independence present, or if the auditor is placed in a compromising position by company directors. Many difficulties lie in determining whether an auditor is truly independent, since it is impossible to observe and measure a person's mental attitude and personal integrity. Similarly, an auditor's objectivity must be beyond question, but how can this be guaranteed and measurement, but appears independent too. If an auditor is in fact independent, but one or more factors suggest otherwise, this could potentially lead to the public concluding that the audit report does not represent a true and fair view. Independence in appearances also reduces the opportunity for an auditor to act otherwise than independently, which subsequently adds credibility to the audit report. Relationship with the client An auditor earns a living from the fee he is paid. It is therefore automatic that he does not want to do anything to jeopardize this income. This reliance on clients‚Äô fees may affect the independence of an auditor. If the auditor feels this client income is more important than their responsibilities to shareholders he may not perform the audit with the shareholders' interests in mind. The larger the fee income the more likely the auditor is to shirk his responsibilities and perform the audit without independence. This could lead to the manipulation of figures and exploitation of accounting standards. By performing the audit without independence the shareholders may get misled, as the auditor is now reliant on the directors. To encourage auditors to maintain their independence they must be protected from the director's board. If they were able to challenge statements and figures without the risk of losing their job they would be more likely to work with complete independence. Ultimately, as long as the client determines audit appointments and fees an auditor will never be able to have complete economic independence.Auditor Independence - General In most cases it is the directors that negotiate an audit contract with the auditors. This may cause problems. Audit firms on occasions quote low prices to directors to ensure repeat business, or to get new clients. By doing so the firm may not be able to perform the audit fully as they do not have enough income to pay for a thorough investigation. Cutting corners could mean the audit team would be reporting without all the evidence required which will affect the quality of the report. This would bring into question their independence. Under what conditions an auditor is dependent on the client is an open question. It is common for the audit firm of a company to provide extra services as well as performing the audit. Helping a company reduce its tax charges or acting as a consultant for the implementation of a new computer system, are common examples. Having this additional working relationship with the client would result in questions being asked of the independence of the audit firm. If non- audit fees are substantial in retaliation to audit fees suspicions will arise that auditing standards may be compromised. The firm would no longer be unbiased, as it would want the company to perform well so it can continue to earn the addition fee for their consultancy. This would mean the audit firm would be dependent on the directors and they would no longer be working with independence. The structure of the accountancy profession Price competition is a major factor in auditor independence.Baker, R., 2005. The Varying Concept of Auditor Independence: Shifting with the Prevailing Environment. The CPA Journal Online. Prior to the 1970s audit firms were not allowed to advertise their services and take part in bidding competitions for contracts. Competition between the accountancy firms greatly increased when these restrictions were abolished, putting pressure on the audit firms to reduce audit fees. Competitive bidding for contracts has also encouraged the reduction of auditor engagement hours. The pressure to reduce costs may compromise the quality of an audit. If a firm feels threatened by competition they may be tempted to further reduce costs to keep a client. This risks lowering the standard of the audit performed and therefore mislead shareholders. The increased competition between the larger firms means that company image is very important. No audit firm wants to have to explain to the press the loss of a big client. This gives the directors of the large company a commanding position over its audit firm and they may look to take advantage of it. The audit team would feel pressured to satisfy the needs of the directors and in doing so would lose their independence. Independence regulations in the United Kingdom Within the United Kingdom there are various regulations in force regarding auditor independence. The main enforcement of auditor independence is through the Companies Act 1985 and the Companies Act 1989 although the matter is also covered by the professional accounting bodies‚Äô rules of professional conduct and the Auditing Practices Board. It is also of note that regulations (i.e. International Accounting Standards or International Financial Reporting Standards) relating to the preparation of financial statements are also relevant. The Companies Act 1985 dictates that it is the responsibility of shareholders (rather than directors) to appoint the auditor at the annual general meeting (AGM) ‚Äì section 384 of the act refers. The theory behind this is that directors cannot intimidate auditors with the threat of replacement or bribe them by offering reappointment. In practice the existing auditors of a company are generally reappointed for another term at the AGM but the shareholders are free to choose another auditor if they wish to. Directors can only appoint auditors in exceptional circumstances (perhaps to fill a casual vacancy during the year). However, such appointments by directors will expire at AGMs. The Companies Act 1985 (section 386) allows shareholders to eliminate the need to reappoint an auditor each year. If they elect to do so then it is automatically assumed that the existing auditor will be reappointed each year without the matter arising at the AGM. In such circumstances it would take an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) in order to remove the auditor. The Companies Act 1989 (part II) goes further to protect the independence of the auditor in various ways. One of the key ways is that auditors must belong to a recognised supervisory body (RSB) before they can undertake such work. Within the United Kingdom ICAEW, ICAS, ICAI and ACCA have been granted this status. Schedules 11 and 12 of the Companies Act 1989 specify the duties of the RSBs and the strict entry requirements for their members that they must impose. It is intended to ensure that all auditors have the required knowledge and skills in order to carry out their role to an acceptable standard. Section 33 of the Companies Act 1989 allows for professional accountants who have gained their qualification in another country to practice within the United Kingdom although it is necessary for such persons to undertake extra education in British law and accounting practices. In the past this tended to favour those trained in Commonwealth countries but due to the EU directive on mutual recognition of professional qualifications it is now possible for professional accountants within Europe to come and work in the United Kingdom. The safeguards put in place by section 33 (that any foreign professional accountants must have an adequate knowledge of British law and accounting practices) should protect the quality of audits. The Companies Act 1989 also has provisions to prevent employees of firms from becoming auditors of their own companies and subsequently either any subsidiary of their employers or parent companies (section 27 refers). This is intended to prevent the appointment of an auditor with conflict of interest with respect to a company. It is also a requirement that any person barred from acting as an auditor should refuse any such offers of appointment and resign immediately if for whatever reason they become ineligible during their appointment. If for whatever reason an ineligible person carries out an audit then the Secretary of State (under section 29 of the Companies Act 1989) has the power to require a company to appoint a second auditor and bear the brunt of the cost as a result. However, companies are allowed to recover additional fees from the original ineligible auditor. Further to regulations regarding the appointment of auditors the various Companies Acts also contain rules regarding the rights of auditors. The most fundamental of these regulations is section 389A of the Companies Act 1985. This section states that auditors have a right of access at all times to accounting related information from companies and further have the right to demand explanations from companies regarding any accounting related enquiry they may have. Section 389A also covers other matters such as making it illegal for employees of a company to make misleading, false or deceptive statements to auditors regarding any accounting related queries they may have. Subsidiaries of British companies also must provide any accounting related information to the auditor of the parent company should they request it although in general it is usually the same auditor who undertakes the audit of both the parent company and its subsidiaries. Section 389A finally goes on to state that companies must take all reasonable steps to obtain accounting related information for auditors from any overseas subsidiaries it may have. Auditors also have the right to communicate directly with shareholders as dictated in section 390 in the Companies Act 1985. Whilst this legislation prevents directors of companies from limiting the information available to auditors it does not prevent directors from setting tight deadlines for auditors where it may prove difficult to obtain all the necessary information they feel they require for audit. Directors could also attempt to negotiate a fee that would not be enough to cover the costs of a proper audit thereby forcing the auditor to perhaps undercut corners in order to reduce costs. Shareholders are not likely to be sympathetic to auditors in such circumstances either as they may be likely to see auditors as unnecessarily overcharging for their service. Because directors can impose tight deadlines, negotiate low audit fees or perhaps threaten to nominate another auditor to shareholders it could be argued that auditors are not truly independent within the United Kingdom. Whilst there may be some truth to this it would not be fair to say the rules are entirely ineffective as auditors have to consider that if they fail to carry out an audit effectively they will face stiff penalties, they could potentially have to compensate any damages as a result of their failure, they could potentially lose a lot of business and ultimately their credibility would be shattered. Therefore, in reality it is thought that British auditors are only influenced in minor ways and normally over matters of opinion given that an auditor would put retaining its business before the loss of one single client. Independence regulations in the United States Issues of audit have been delegated by the U.S. Congress to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As part of the Sarbanes-Oxley act the SEC has issued Requirements Regarding Auditor Independence.U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission: Strengthening the Commission's Requirements Regarding Auditor Independence; Title 17 CFR PARTS ¬ß210, ¬ß240, ¬ß249 and ¬ß274, final rule, 27 March 2003, https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/33-8183.htm Recently the SEC has followed up on cases where auditor independence is questionable William F. Sullivan, Thomas A. Zaccaro, and Adam D. Schneir (Paul, Hastings, Janofsky, & Walker LLP): The SEC‚Äôs View of Auditor Independence; Bloomberg Law Reports -- Risk and Compliance, Vol.2 No.1, 2009. Possible future developments Service limitations Many have advocated that in order for an auditor to remain strictly independent they should not be allowed to provide audit clients with any other advisory services. This idea was detailed in the EC's Eighth Directive and was designed to remove conflicts of interest arising from audit companies having a high percentage of total revenue staked in the contract of one client. To date this has not been made a requirement. Both auditors and their clients have argued that the knowledge acquired during the audit process can allow other services to be provided less expensively. Peer assessment A review of audit control procedures by another firm is a requirement in the US that must be satisfied once every three years. This has been implemented to ensure external audits are carried out with the utmost professionalism and independence at all times. Such a system has not been accepted by UK auditors; however, it is expected that many large firms already have peer reviews in place which are conducted by audit teams from offices in other parts of the country. Audit committees The recommendation for companies to form an audit committee was first made in the Cadbury Report (1992). A group of three to five non-executive directors from within the company are chosen to provide what is supposed to be a truly objective view on all aspects of the audit: from evaluation of internal control systems to recommendations on audit fee. Since the Cadbury Report, this practice has been implemented yet many still remain unconvinced of the neutrality of non- executive directors. Rotating external auditors Proponents argue either mandatory rotation of audit firm or mandatory rotation of engagement partners could improve auditor independence. It is argued that an incumbent auditor has less incentive to collude with their client if the firm's contract expires in the foreseeable future or that auditors are less likely to forge conflicting relationships with client personnel. http://www.icaew.com/~/media/Files/Library/collections/ICAEW%20archive/mandatory- rotation-of-audit-firms-review-of-current-requirements-research-and- publications ICAEW's review of 6/2002 on Mandatory rotation of audit firms Further, because current auditors will know they are soon to be replaced, they will be inclined to produce audit reports which demonstrate high standards and are an exemplar of true independence, and avoid having any shortcomings exposed by the new audit team. However, empirical evidence is mixed. Most research suggests financial reporting quality is lower when auditor tenure is low. One possible explanation is that it is difficult and costly to obtain the client-specific knowledge required to produce a high quality audit. These costs need to be weighed against the threat of impaired independence, mentioned above. Proposals for a maximum client servicing period of five years have since been dismissed after lobbying by accounting firms and their clients, again stressing that it is vitally important that auditors familiarise themselves with client operations in order to conduct a successful audit. Recent research suggests the relation between partner tenure and audit quality might be more effective for small audit firms, but that five years might be too short a period. There is evidence that the relation between audit partner tenure and audit quality is hyperbolic, with perceived audit quality reduced at the time of rotation but then improving for several years, only to deteriorate again when the audit partner has been incumbent for a fairly long time. This is based on an Australian study, where mandatory audit partner rotation was introduced in 2004 by the CLERP 9 legislation.Azizkhani, A., Monroe, G., & Shailer, G. Audit Partner Tenure and Cost of Equity Capital. Auditing: Journal of Practice & Theory 32(1) 2013: 183-202. The International Federation of Accountants recommends partner rotation but not rotation of firms. The IFAC states in its International Standard on Quality Control (ISQC1 of 15/12/09) that \\"The IESBA Code (International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants) recognizes that the familiarity threat is particularly relevant in the context of financial statement audits of listed entities. For these audits, the IESBA Code requires the rotation of the key audit partner after a pre-defined period, normally no more than seven years, and provides related standards and guidance. National requirements may establish shorter rotation periods\\"http://web.ifac.org/download/a007-2010-iaasb-handbook-isqc-1.pdf In the area of Government Auditing, in its ISSAI 1000 standard (art.66) the INTOSAI also recommends partner rotation: \\"ISQC 1 requires engagement partner rotation for listed entities after a predefined period. In the public sector, this requirement may be applied to significant public interest entities. However, legislation establishing the appointments and terms of office of the Auditor General may make rotation impractical. Supreme Audit Institutions may establish policies and procedures to promote compliance with the spirit of this requirement\\". In the United States, audit partner rotation is recommended in Title II Section 203 Sarbanes Oxley 116 Stat 773 (Audit Partner Rotation) (Audit Partner Rotation) of the Sarbanes‚ÄìOxley Act. The European Commission has issued on 16/5/02 a recommendation: \\"Statutory Auditors‚Äô Independence in the EU, A Set of Fundamental Principles\\". The recommendation only requires partner rotation on listed clients after seven years. It differs in some respects from most national/international requirements, namely:‚Ä¢ it allows a return after two years ‚Ä¢ it applies to ‚Äòpublic interest clients‚Äô, not just listed clients ‚Ä¢ in a group context, extends to key audit partners other than the audit engagement partner. No countries within the EU, with the exception of Italy, currently have a system of mandatory audit firm rotation. In the United Kingdom, the Auditing Practices Board (FRC) has issued a revised Ethical Standard 3: Long Association with the Audit Engagement (applies on 15 December 2009). It can be summarised as follows: Audit engagement partner - maximum rotation period remains at five years, with a minimum of five years not involved in the audit afterwards. However, flexibility of up to an additional two years is permitted.http://www.icaew.com/en/technical/ethics/auditor-independence/apb- amends-rotation-requirements-for-audit-partners-on-listed-entity-audits Law, regulations and the conceptual framework of accounting In the future, issues regarding conflicts of interest may be tackled through legislation which bans audit firms holding shares in client companies. Some financial commentators believe that it is the subjective nature of modern-day accounting which is the main contributor to the ambiguity of auditor independence and suggest this could be clarified through the introduction of a conceptual framework, rather than legislation. They feel a set of agreed definitions on matters which are not encompassed by formal standards would benefit the auditor and, ultimately, remove any doubts over real and apparent independence.

The Church is the oldest Polish church in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Buffalo and holds the title of \\"Mother Church of Polonia\\" for western New York. History The parish was established on June 8, 1873 by Rev. Jan Pitass and the Society of Saint Stanislaus. The original church was a two-story, wood frame church that was built in 1874. That church was converted to a school shortly after the present-day church was completed in 1886. In 1904, the church's parish was among the largest in the U.S. with close to 20,000 parishioners and nearly 2,000 children were enrolled in the school. The church contains an 1893 Johnson & Son pipe organ in the choir loft. There are three carrara marble altars in the sanctuary and the main altar is 34 ft high. In 1889, St. Stanislaus Bishop & Martyr Cemetery was established in nearby Cheektowaga, NY. The cemetery occupies 20 acres of land. In 1965, St. Stanislaus social center was constructed near the church. Church Building Ground breaking began on the present day church on August 10, 1882 and took nearly 4 years to complete. In 1908, the church steeples, bells, Cupolas, and 6.5 ft diameter clocks were installed at a cost of ‚Ç¨40,000. The massive church towers rise to a height of 217 ft. Restoration On November 20, 2000, a storm with severe winds resulted in the removal of the cross and cupola on the left tower of St. Stanislaus. Restoration of the cupola was completed on July 11, 2003 at a cost of $300,000. Of that cost, only one third was covered by insurance. As a result of this restoration, the left and right cupola are no longer matching in color. In 2005, the church underwent its most extensive restoration and renovation in the churches history. The work included 8 new clock faces and 4 new clock bells in the clock towers. Restoration work to the church's 1893 Johnson pipe organ, maintenance to the stained glass and handmade wooden doors, a gold-leaf frieze applied to the vestibule and new lighting for the fountain statue. The total cost approached US$2 million. Present day In 2009 Thaddeus Bocianowski was named only the seventh pastor of the historic parish. As part of the Roman Catholic Church's ongoing downsizing campaign, the church was re-designated \\"a shrine to St. Stanislaus and all Polish martyrs\\" and a Polish cultural center on October 11, 2009, ostensibly due to the declining populace, which had impacted attendance at the church. In 2008, the school on Wilson street was closed after enrollment fell to only 75. The school had lasted 127 years and was staffed by Felician sisters for its entire history.

History It is one of the few significant Faberg√© eggs that were not made for the Russian Imperial family, and it had been in the Rothschild family since it was first purchased. It was one of the most expensive eggs that Faberg√© had ever made and sold. Sale in 2007 It was sold by Christie's auction house on 28 November 2007, for ¬£8.9 million (including commission). The price achieved by the egg set three auction records: it is the most expensive timepiece, Russian object, and Faberg√© object ever sold at auction, surpassing the $9.6 million sale of the 1913 Winter egg in 2002. The egg was bought by Alexander Ivanov, the director of the Russian National Museum. \\"It's one of the most beautiful, valuable and most intricate Faberg√© eggs ever,\\" Ivanov said, as well as adding that \\"We didn't have investors, and this egg will go into the private museum which we are building in downtown Moscow. We will not resell it.\\" The Rothschild egg was eventually displayed at Ivanov's Faberg√© Museum in Baden-Baden, Germany. Subsequent history On 8 December 2014, the Rothschild egg was given to the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia. This occurred during a reception to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the museum. The presentation of the egg was made by Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia, who also gave another item by Faberg√© to the museum. In a speech during the reception, Putin made the following remarks: \\"I would like to present a gift to the Hermitage: a clock created by Carl Faberge, and a clock-egg, another of Carl Faberge‚Äôs works. The first is a clock created for the 25th anniversary of the marriage between Emperor Alexander III and Empress Maria Feodorovna. The second is called the Rothschild-Faberge-Clock-Egg. I hope they will find a place in the Hermitage‚Äôs displays.\\" As of January 2019, the Rothschild egg is on display in Room 302 of the Hermitage's General Staff Building. It has been reported that Ivanov donated the egg to the Russian government in 2014. On 1 December 2014, British and German tax investigators had conducted a search of Ivanov's Faberg√© Museum in Baden-Baden. It appears that this raid was connected to a tax dispute involving the Rothschild egg.

Structure  The MT-TH gene is located on the p arm of the mitochondrial DNA at position 12 and it spans 69 base pairs. The structure of a tRNA molecule is a distinctive folded structure which contains three hairpin loops and resembles a three- leafed clover.  Function  MT-TH is a small 69 nucleotide transfer RNA (human mitochondrial map position 12138-12206) that transfers the amino acid histidine to a growing polypeptide at the ribosomal site of protein synthesis during translation. Clinical significance Mutations in MT-TH can result in multiple mitochondrial deficiencies and associated disorders. MT-TH is associated with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke- like episodes (MELAS), cardiomyopathy, and the MELAS/MERRF overlap syndrome.  Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS)  A small number of people with symptoms of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) have been found to have mutations in the MT-TH gene. MELAS is a rare mitochondrial disorder known to affect many parts of the body, especially the nervous system and the brain. Symptoms of MELAS include recurrent severe headaches, muscle weakness (myopathy), hearing loss, stroke-like episodes with a loss of consciousness, seizures, and other problems affecting the nervous system. MERRF/MELAS overlap syndrome MELAS syndrome may also be accompanied by another mitochondrial disorder called myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers, also known as MERRF syndrome. In addition to symptoms of MELAS syndrome, additional signs and symptoms may include muscle twitches (myoclonus), difficulty coordinating movement (ataxia), and abnormal muscle cells known as ragged-red fibers. The combination of MERRF and MELAS is called the MERRF/MELAS overlap syndrome, which is caused by mutations in the MT-TH gene. It has not been determined how such mutations alter the energy production function of the mitochondria and result in symptoms of such syndromes. A specific mutation of 12147G>A in the MT-TH gene has been found to result in the MERRF/MELAS overlap syndrome. A patient with the mutation exhibited symptoms of migrainous headache and vomiting, left hemiparesis, lateral homonymous hemianopia, and others consistent with the MERRF/MELAS overlap syndrome. The patient exhibited symptoms of MELAS first, then progressed into the overlap syndrome. Cardiomyopathy Mutations in the MT-TH gene may also cause cardiomyopathy, a disorder of the heart characterized by the thickening of the heart, usually in the interventricular septum, which results in a weakened heart muscle that is unable to pump blood effectively. Patients with mutations in the MT-TH gene have been found to exhibit symptoms of cardiomyopathy without other common signs of mitochondrial disease such as neurological abnormalities. It is unclear why such mutations result in the symptoms of isolated cardiomyopathy. A specific mutation of 12192G>A in the MT-TH gene has been found in multiple patients with the disorder. patients exhibited symptoms of cardiomyopathy in different forms. Deafness, Nonsyndromic Sensorineural, Mitochondrial Deafness has also been associated with mutations in the MT-TH gene.

MT-ND5 is one of the seven NADH dehydrogenase mitochondrial genes (yellow boxes). MT-ND5 is a gene of the mitochondrial genome coding for the NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 5 protein (ND5). The ND5 protein is a subunit of NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone), which is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane and is the largest of the five complexes of the electron transport chain. Variations in human MT-ND5 are associated with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) as well as some symptoms of Leigh's syndrome and Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON).  Structure  MT-ND5 is located in mitochondrial DNA from base pair 12,337 to 14,148. The MT-ND5 gene produces a 67 kDa protein composed of 603 amino acids. MT-ND5 is one of seven mitochondrial genes encoding subunits of the enzyme NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone), together with MT-ND1, MT-ND2, MT- ND3, MT-ND4, MT-ND4L, and MT-ND6. Also known as Complex I, this enzyme is the largest of the respiratory complexes. The structure is L-shaped with a long, hydrophobic transmembrane domain and a hydrophilic domain for the peripheral arm that includes all the known redox centres and the NADH binding site. MT- ND5 and the rest of the mitochondrially encoded subunits are the most hydrophobic of the subunits of Complex I and form the core of the transmembrane region.  Function  The MT-ND5 product is a subunit of the respiratory chain Complex I that is supposed to belong to the minimal assembly of core proteins required to catalyze NADH dehydrogenation and electron transfer to ubiquinone (coenzyme Q10). Initially, NADH binds to Complex I and transfers two electrons to the isoalloxazine ring of the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) prosthetic arm to form FMNH2. The electrons are transferred through a series of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters in the prosthetic arm and finally to coenzyme Q10 (CoQ), which is reduced to ubiquinol (CoQH2). The flow of electrons changes the redox state of the protein, resulting in a conformational change and pK shift of the ionizable side chain, which pumps four hydrogen ions out of the mitochondrial matrix. Clinical Significance A small percentage of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) are caused by a G>A mutation at base pair 13513 in the MT-ND5 gene. Mutations in the MT-ND5 gene cause impaired Complex I function of the mitochondrial electron transport system, impairing those tissues that require significant energy input, such as the brain and muscles. Cardiac and renal involvement as well as symptoms such as myopathy and lactic acidosis can also be observed. Those with MT-ND5 mutations can display the major features of MELAS and MERRF in some patients, as well as symptoms of Leigh's syndrome and/or Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) in others.  Interactions  MT-ND5 interacts with Glutamine synthetase (GLUL), LIG4 and YME1L1.

Abnormalities in mitochondrial energy generation result in neurodegenerative disorders like Leigh syndrome, which is characterized by an onset of symptoms between 12 months and three years of age. The symptoms frequently present themselves following a viral infection and include movement disorders and peripheral neuropathy, as well as hypotonia, spasticity and cerebellar ataxia. Roughly half of affected individuals die of respiratory or cardiac failure by the age of three. Leigh syndrome is a maternally inherited disorder and its diagnosis is established through genetic testing of the aforementioned mitochondrial genes, including MT-ND1. The m.4171C>A/MT-ND1 mutation also leads to a Leigh-like phenotype as well as bilateral brainstem lesions affecting the vestibular nuclei, resulting in vision loss, vomiting and vertigo. These complex I genes have been associated with a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, including Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with stroke-like episodes (MELAS), overlap between LHON and MELAS, and the previously mentioned Leigh syndrome. Mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from variants of MT-ND1, MT-ND2 and MT-ND4L have been linked to BMI in adults and implicated in metabolic disorders including obesity, diabetes and hypertension.

There are also more professional fingerboards made of wood. A fingerboard is a working replica (about 1:8 scaled) of a skateboard that a person \\"rides\\" by replicating skateboarding maneuvers with their fingers. The device itself is a scaled-down skateboard complete with graphics, trucks and moving wheels. A fingerboard is commonly about long, and can have a variety of widths ranging from . Skateboarding tricks may be performed using fingers instead of feet. Tricks done on a fingerboard are inspired by tricks done on real skateboards. Professional skateboarder Lance Mountain is widely credited as making the first fingerboard, and his skit in Powell-Peralta's \\"Future Primitive\\" video brought fingerboarding to the skateboarders of the world in the mid-1980s. Around the same time, he wrote an article on how to make fingerboards in TransWorld SKATEboarding magazine. Although fingerboarding was a novelty within the skateboarding industry for years, as skateboarding reached enormous and widespread popularity in the late 1990s, Canadian toymaker Spin Master realized the potential for the toys, specifically for products bearing the logos and branding of real skateboarding brands, and introduced the Tech Deck brand. These fingerboards caught on during this period and the brand has since grown into a widely recognized icon in the toy business. Toy fingerboards like Tech Decks are now available as inexpensive novelty toys as well as high-end collectibles, complete with accessories one would find in use with standard- size skateboards. Fingerboards are also used by skateboarders as 3-D model visual aids to understand potential tricks and maneuvers; many users make videos to document their efforts. Similar to fingerboarding, although less popular, handboarding involves a scaled-down version of a skateboard that a user controls with their hands to achieve more intricate tricks and challenges. History Fingerboards were first created as homemade finger toys in the late 1960s and later became a novelty attached to keychains in skate shops (but were also mentioned as a model for a skateboard). In the 1985 Powell-Peralta skateboarding video \\"Future Primitive,\\" Lance Mountain rode a homemade fingerboard in a double-bin sink. It is widely accepted that this is where the idea for the ramp found in The Search for Animal Chin came from. Some consider this the earliest fingerboard footage available for public viewing. That homemade fingerboard was built from wood, tubes, and toy train axles. Fingerboards have been a peripheral part of the skateboarding industry since the late 1980s and were originally marketed as keychains. Somerville International's Fingerboard brand, established in 1987, was the first to mass- produce fingerboards with licensed-actual skateboard graphics with the introduction of the Pro-Precision board. Since their introduction, the brand has undergone numerous changes in naming convention, product designs, and partnerships. Most notably their partnership with McDonalds to produce fingerboards for Happy Meal toys in the early 2000s. They produced a number of \\"finger sport\\" toys and also created the skateboarding action figure \\"Finger Boy\\" and \\"Finger Girl\\". They are also credited to the first mass-produced wooden fingerboard, utilizing parts from their 2nd generation fingerboards. One of the first companies to design and manufacture fingerboard ramps was Buckledown (Buckledown Products). Instead of a popular toy store, you had to get their products in skateboard equipment catalog such as CCS, or had to hope your local skateshop stocked a few. Buckledown holds the first U.S. Patent to a fingerboard ramp design. Shortly after, a brand called \\"Berzerk\\" by Hobbico produced fingerboard kit ramps out of a coroplast material. These ramps had an eerily strong resemblance to the Buckledown kit ramps. On the back of the Berzerk packaging, a website link that read \\"www.techdeck.com\\". What exactly ensued after their release is unclear, but finding these \\"lawsuit\\" era kit- ramps are few and far between. Shortly after in 1999, Tech Deck, now claimed by X-Concepts hit every toy store across the United States with a redesigned ramp kit, and a more accurate model of a skateboard compared to the Pro- Precision boards. X-Concepts followed Somerville's ideology with licensed pro graphics from major skateboard brands, as well as designs harnessed from entertainment properties such as \\"Speed Racer,\\" \\"Woody Woodpecker,\\" \\"NASCAR,\\" \\"Heavy Metal,\\" and \\"Crash Bandicoot.\\" As fingerboards became more prominent outside the skateboarding community, in 1999 there was a Tech Deck fashion of collecting one of each design similar to the Beanie Baby fad months prior. Entertainment-based fingerboard brands couldn't compete against the urban juggernaut, and eventually disappeared. Skateboard manufacturers also caught on to the opportunity. Think's Super Mini Boards, the Deluxe Finger Banger Boards, and Shorty's Digi Decks to name a few. Skateboard Clothing/Shoe companies such as DC Shoes and ZooYork included a fingerboard with their own branding as an extra when you purchased one of their products in the early 2000s. They thus developed the fingerboard into a collectible toy and the practice into a \\"form of mental skating\\". Fingerboarding is popular in Europe, Singapore, Asia and the United States, and there is growing popularity in Eastern Europe. Besides skateshops and the internet, Fingaspeak, a fingerboard store opened in Steyr, Austria although rumored to be the world's first fingerboard store, it joins a very small list of fingerboard stores that are available. Although the sport of fingerboarding originated in the United States over 25 years ago it has really caught on fire in the European scene. The United States is following and it is estimated that although the popularity seems to be in favor of the Europeans, the American Fingerboard scene has equal sales. This may be due to the flooding of the market and the availability of resources in the United States. Fingerboarding has evolved from a hobby to a lifestyle for some people. Fingerboarders have regular \\"contests, fairs, workshops and other events\\". Example of these events are: FastFingers, and FlatFace Rendezvous. Fingerboard-product sales were estimated at $120-million for 1999. Fingerboarding is a good match for videography as the action can be controlled and framing the activity offers opportunities for creativity. With the rise of the online video business from early 2006, fueled, in part, because the feature that allows e-mailing clips to friends, several thousand finger board and handboard videos can now be found on popular video-sharing sites such as YouTube. Thus even if the weather does not permit a skateboarder to practice outside they could try a potential trick with their scaled-down fingerboard and related items and share the video with whomever they wished. Usage A fingerboard approaching a ramp Fingerboards are used by a range of people from those utilizing them as toys to skateboarding and related sports professionals envisioning not only their own skating maneuvers but for others as well and can include the use for planning out competition courses as skateboarding develops into an international sport. Similar to train enthusiasts building railway models, fingerboard hobbyists often construct and purchase reduced scale model figures that would be considered natural features to an urban skateboarder such as handrails, benches, and stairs they would be likely to encounter while riding. In addition users might build and buy items seen in a skatepark including half-pipes, Patent number: 6350174; Filing date: Aug 3, 2000; Issue date: Feb 26, 2002. quarter pipes, trick boxes, vert ramps, Patent number: 6623367, Filing date: Jul 17, 1999; Issue date: Sep 23, 2003. pyramids, banked ramps, full pipes, and any number of other trick-oriented objects. Patent number: 7261613; Filing date: Dec 10, 2004; Issue date: Aug 28, 2007 These objects can be used simply for enjoyment and also to assist the visualization of skateboarding tricks or the \\"flow\\" from one trick to the next (colloquially referred to as \\"lines\\"). Fingerboarding events feature some of the latest elaborate models and accessories; many of the manufacturers features photos and videos on their websites. Components The parts of a fingerboard are: deck, grip tape (grip, rip tape, rubber tape), trucks, bushings, and wheels. The trucks and decks can easily be modified (modding) to reduce weight, improve smoothness or look better. The trucks are screwed to the deck by means of tiny screws. Modding tutorials can be found online. Decks are the major component of a board and where, on a standard skateboard, one would stand. There is a wide variety of decks with material ranging from wood to plastic, to paper. Most commonly, decks are made out of wood, as this gives it more \\"pop\\" and a more authentic feel. The average deck will have two kicks - a flared end used for leveraging the board - while some old-school models have only one end flared. During the early stages of the fingerboarding scene, decks traditionally had lower kicks like that of a Berlinwood Old Mold or a Tech Deck however, the \\"default\\" shape nowadays has medium kicks and low concave. Some decks have higher kicks, like Aphlikshun's K Deck, and if the kicks are very steep, they are referred to as \\"wall kicks\\". Some companies offer complete custom fingerboards, such as, which type of shape, graphic, or ply they want. Examples: Yellowood, Diamond Decks Fingerboard, Berlinwood, Flatface, and Lowpro. Griptape is the friction tape adhered to the topside of the deck to enable users to more easily maintain control of the board. There are many types of griptape. Some use standard skateboard griptape, although the griptape may wear out faster on fingerboards as they endure more moisture from the sweat and oils of a user's hands. There are also softer alternatives and grippy tape which is less harsh on a user's fingers allowing them to fingerboard for longer periods of time. Examples of this tape are Riptape, FBS Extra Smooth, No Comply Foamy Greatness, and Yellowood's Slim Tape. Most of these are made a thin layer of foam, with adhesive on the reverse. Trucks are the structures attached to the bottom of the deck that house the wheels and bushings. Some trucks are all one molded piece while others are scaled-down versions of regular skateboard trucks. Example: BRR Trucks, Y-Trucks. As fingerboarding has evolved \\"collector\\" and \\"pro\\" versions have emerged with some brands shaped using special instruments to make them lighter and look better. Bushings are pliable material that provide the cushion mechanism for turning a standard skateboard but on a fingerboard help stabilize the trucks thus keeping the wheels in the same position to enable stronger tricks and visual appeal. Collector and \\"pro\\" brand bushings are made from many different types of squishy material, usually rubberized plastic or rubber. The wheels can determine how smooth the ride is thus what kind of \\"flow\\" a user's ride can be. The professional brands are traditionally made out of a variety of different materials, and have small ball-bearings inside the bearings to enhance the smoothness. A couple examples of these wheels, Flatface Wheels, Ywheels, Oak Wheels, and Winkler Wheels. Tech Deck makes hard plastic as well as wooden skateboards and borrows designs from many well-known skateboard manufacturers, such as Blind, Flip, and Element. They use grip tape, and professional graphics on most of their decks. The stock trucks on Tech Decks are made of die-cast metal and have two separate axles for the wheels to roll on. The wheels are made out of plastic along with the bushings. Some fingerboarders prefer the feel and performance of decks made from wood. Wooden decks can be made from 3-7 plies of a given veneer; maple, walnut, and mahogany being the most popular. All of the hole-drilling and shaping is done by hand or with the aid of a machine, thus the price is higher. A wooden deck from a popular company can have a low to high price range usually depending on the quality of the deck one is to purchase, prices range from 10 - US$52. Wooden fingerboard makers are now offering custom designs; the buyer can choose from their line of graphics or send in their own. The wooden boards come in a variety of widths from 26 ‚Äì 32 mm and concave can vary greatly from maker to maker. Some companies offer even more customization options such as the choosing of the plies used to go into the deck, as well as the width/length of the deck. Along with wooden decks, advanced fingerboarders also tend to prefer using wheels modeled on real skateboard wheels, made from sturdy compounds and outfitted with ball-bearings. Companies such as Oak Wheels, FlatFace Fingerboards and Joycult Wheels manufacture and sell bearing wheels that are made from a range of materials, including teflon, urethane, silicon, fiberglass, and even clay. The wheels are usually put into a lathe to ensure the best shape. Once the wheels have been readied, bearings are put into place to increase the smoothness of the wheels rolling on the axle. Tuning screws for the wheels cause the wheels to roll more smoothly. Rather than using the stock axles and kingpins that come on Tech Deck trucks, some more advanced fingerboards use tuning screws, softer 'foam griptape' and custom kingpins to ensure that wheels and hangars are more properly secured. Blackriver Trucks, YTrucks and Dynamic Trucks are three brands that manufacture fingerboard trucks designed to work with more precision, allowing a fingerboarder to pivot quickly and do tricks without worrying that the trucks will come apart. These fingerboard trucks (and other specialty fingerboard products) are often sold at a much higher price compared to Tech Deck products. Board rails can also be added to the deck bottom similar to those used on a standard skateboard. Fingerboards made with plastic are sometimes modified by heating the plastic to shape it, such as making the kicks higher or adding concavity.  Fingersnowboarding, handboards and fingersurfboards  A 181x181px Similar to fingerboarding, fingersnowboarding is snowboarding on a small-scale snowboard controlled with one's fingers. In December 1999 the first-ever World Snowboard Fingerboard Championships was held with a cash prize of C$1,000.00. Sponsored by companies such as Gravity Fingerboards, Transworld Snowboarding and Snowboard Life magazines and others the competition featured twenty competitors utilizing a custom \\"fingerboard snowboard park.\\" Tom Sims, a world champion of snowboarding,\\"Snowboarders Finally in Olympics, But Are Conforming Grudgingly\\", Salt Lake Tribune, February 8, 1998. ended his run by landing his fingersnowboard into a flaming shotglass of Sambuka; he was treated for minor burns and donated his winning prize to Surfrider Foundation's Snowrider Project and to Board AID. Handboards, similar to fingerboards, are a scaled-down version of a skateboard roughly half to a third of the size of a standard skateboard (29 centimeters or 11 in) and utilizes a person's hands rather than just their fingers to control the board and perform tricks and maneuvers. Handboards, because of their larger size, more closely match details of a standard skateboard. For instance a skateboard truck, the wheel structure, would more likely to match part for part an actual skateboard truck rather than be a cast one-piece construction or otherwise simplified. If a user preferred a particular type of wood or decorative style that could also more easily resemble a full-scale skateboard.

Price was signed by the Chiefs as an undrafted free agent on May 8, 2007. He was placed on injured reserve on August 28, 2007. He led all Chiefs' receivers in both receptions and receiving yardage in the 2008 pre-season games, including a touchdown at Chicago in his first NFL game appearance. He made the Chiefs' 53-man roster in 2008, but was waived by the team on September 9, 2008 and re-signed to the Chiefs' practice squad on September 11, 2008. He was then waived from the practice squad on September 19, 2008. Following this release he received attention from many NFL clubs and worked out for three clubs before choosing to sign to the Active roster of the New England Patriots. New England Patriots Price was signed to the 53 man roster by the Patriots on September 24, 2008. He was waived by the team on October 11, 2008, and re-signed to the team's practice squad on October 15, 2008. San Francisco 49ers Price was signed to a future contract by the San Francisco 49ers on January 29, 2009. He was waived on September 5. Calgary Stampeders Price was signed to the practice roster of the Calgary Stampeders on September 14, 2009. Baltimore Ravens Price was signed to the practice squad of the Baltimore Ravens on December 16, 2009. On January 19 Price signed a reserve future contract. Washington Redskins Price was signed to the Washington Redskins' practice squad on December 1, 2010. He was waived on July 30, 2011. Tampa Bay Buccaneers Price signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on August 14, 2011. He was cut on September 3, 2011. Calgary Stampeders Price re-signed with the Calgary Stampeders on February 22, 2012. After showing great promise to become a starter and suffering a broken foot in training camp Price returned in late season to become the leading receiver on the team in the last four games of the regular season. This streak included three games in a row with touchdown reception of 50 yards or more. On October 20 in a home game played in a snowstorm, Price recorded 71 receiving yards on two catches ‚Äì including a 56-yard reception for a touchdown, his first in the CFL. In the first playoff game he again led the team in receptions and yardage with 6 grabs for 127 yards. Maurice Price missed 4 of the first 8 games of the 2013 season due to various injuries. He won Offensive Player of the Week, for Week 10 of the 2013 CFL season, putting up 165 yards receiving and 3 touchdowns. After the 2013 season, Price signed a contract extension with the Stampeders, avoiding pending free agency.Price checked off free agent list; receiver signs extension Price started the 2014 CFL season with a bang, a 102-yard touchdown reception against the Al's. Following that game Price only played in 9 of the remaining 17 games regular season games, missing time due to injury. Aside from the Week 1, 102 yard performance, he only averaged 49.1 receiving yards per game. Maurice Price had 64 receiving yards on 5 catches during the 102nd Grey Cup, his only post- season game that season. The Stamps won the 102nd Grey Cup to conclude the season, giving Price his first Grey Cup championship.  Ottawa RedBlacks  On January 15, 2015, the Ottawa RedBlacks traded LB Jasper Simmons and WR Dan Buckner to the Stampeders in exchange for Maurice Price. Rick Cambell, the head coach of the RedBlacks, had been with Price and the Stamps during the 2012 and 2013 CFL seasons. Ottawa was hoping that Price can provide the offense with some explosiveness which the team lacked during its inaugural season. In his first season with the Redblacks Price did not make as large an impact as some might have expected, finishing 5th on the team in receiving yards. Maurice Price did however manage to play in every game of the 2015 CFL season, something that had troubled him in the past. He set a career best with 58 receptions, accounting for 603 yards with a lone receiving touchdown.  Saskatchewan Roughriders  On January 11, 2016, Price was traded to the Saskatchewan Roughriders along with a sixth round 2016 CFL Draft pick for two late 2016 draft picks.Roughriders acquire Maurice Price from Redblacks Price signed a contract extension the next day.Riders acquire receiver Maurice Price Months after signing a contract with the Roughriders, Price retired.

It was first published in the US in 1962 by Harper & Row and in the UK by Heinemann the following year. It explores, in the phrase of critic Brigid Brophy, \\"the psychology of the self-selected victim\\".Brigid Brophy, Don't Never Forget (Holt Rinehard & Winston, 1967),  Composition  Highsmith wrote The Cry of the Owl between April 1961 and February 1962. She considered it to be one of her weaker efforts, calling its principal character \\"rather square ... a polite sitting duck for more evil characters, and a passive bore\\".Andrew Wilson: Beautiful Shadow ‚Äì A Life of Patricia Highsmith, Bloomsbury, 2003, Highsmith drew on her own experience as a stalker; years before, when employed by a New York City store, she became obsessed with a woman she had waited on. She adapted these events for her novel The Price of Salt (1952). The setting for this book is much like the area where Highsmith was currently living in New Hope, Pennsylvania. The title refers to Jenny's belief that foreboding incidents precede events in her life, which are determined by fate. She considers the owl a harbinger of death. She also believes that, just as years ago an unknown man appeared in her family's house before her younger brother's death, so Robert's appearance foretells a death. Highsmith ended her relationship with Marijane Meaker about the time she started work on this novel, in April 1961. Meaker told an interviewer that Highsmith modeled the character of Nickie after her as an act of \\"retaliation\\". The novel is dedicated only to \\"D.W.\\", an apparent reference to Daisy Winston, Highsmith's former lover and neighbor in New Hope.  Plot summary  Following a painful divorce from his wife Nickie, Robert Forester leaves New York and moves to small-town Langley, Pennsylvania, where he develops an obsession for 23-year-old Jenny Thierolf. He spies on her through her kitchen window, enjoying \\"the girl's placid temperament, her obvious affection for her rather ramshackle house, her contentment with her life\\". He is surprised when she invites him into her house after spotting him one night. Each seems to represent something more for the other than it appears, to embody a larger emotional force than a mere personality. Robert explains to his therapist: \\"'I have the definite feeling if everybody in the world didn't keep watching to see what everybody else did, we'd all go berserk. Left on their own, people wouldn't know how to live.'\\" Jenny sees their chance meeting as an act of fate and breaks off her engagement to hot-tempered Greg Wyncoop, who is resentful and begins spying on the pair; he plans to learn more about Robert so as to find a way to get even with him. Greg picks up information from Nickie as well, and she encourages him to find a way to punish her ex- husband. During the next weeks, Jenny pursues Robert, contacting him at his home and at his job at Langley Aeronautics. Robert is offered a promotion at work that requires him to relocate to another city, and he hopes this will put an end to Jenny's advances, which are making him increasingly uneasy. One night, on a road, Greg starts a fight with Robert that ends when Robert knocks Greg unconscious and leaves him on a river bank. When Greg is reported missing, the police suspect Robert has murdered him, though Robert in fact was the victim of Greg's attack and had last seen Greg alive. The police feel that their suspicions about Robert are confirmed when Nickie tells them that he once threatened her with a weapon. After a newspaper publishes an article about the case, Robert's promotion is withdrawn. A badly decomposed body is found in the river and the police think it is Greg's, but identification proves difficult. Jenny comes to believe that Robert has murdered her former fianc√© and, in spite of loving him, accepts that he represents death and that it is preordained that she should die; she commits suicide. Nickie's new husband Ralph Jurgen informs Robert that Greg is alive, that Greg and Nickie have staged Greg's disappearance in order to frame Robert. Greg then begins stalking Robert at his home and taking shots at him. One of the bullets eventually hits Robert; the police do not seem to believe that Greg is alive and Robert's neighbors condemn him for 'leading a young girl astray' and 'leading her to her death'. The doctor who tends to him invites him to stay at his home to recover. There, Greg fires a shot which wounds the doctor, eventually resulting in the man's death. The police finally see the truth and arrest Greg, but release him on bail. He goes to see Nickie and together they go to Robert's home, which he is about to leave for good, and a final confrontation occurs. Greg tries to knife Robert but instead kills Nickie. Robert will again be front and center in a death investigation. Reception In the New York Times, Thomas Lask wrote that \\"Miss Highsmith starts in low gear and the first fourth of the book marks time as she goes through some preliminary passes. Her characters are only puppets. But once it starts rolling the tale accelerates rapidly, dangers and suspense pile up and the reader goes along very willingly to the conclusion. And a gory one it is, too.\\" In 1967, British writer and critic Brigid Brophy stated that, of the novels written in the last twenty years, five or six stood out, including Highsmith's The Cry of the Owl and Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita.  Film, TV or theatrical adaptations  Highsmith's novel was the premise for the French film Le Cri du hibou (1987) directed by Claude Chabrol and starring Mathilda May. Also in 1987, German writer-director Tom Toelle directed an adaption for German television titled Der Schrei der Eule. A third film adaptation written and directed by Jamie Thraves and starring Julia Stiles and Paddy Considine was released in 2009. German director Wim Wenders sought to buy the rights for a screen adaption in the 1970s, but finding the rights unavailable chose to make Highsmith's Ripley's Game into the film Der Amerikanische Freund. A 4-part radio dramatisation was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2002. Adapted by Shaun McKenna it starred Joanne McQinn, John Sharian and Adrian Lester.

Life Jan√°k studied with Otto Wagner in Vienna between 1906 and 1908, and worked in Prague under Jan Kotƒõra. In 1911, with the publication of an article The Prism and The Pyramid advocating dynamic architectural compositions and destabilizing traditional right-angled buildings, Jan√°k became the leading theoretician of Czech Cubism. Of the three Czech cubists‚ÄîJan√°k, Josef Chochol and Josef Goƒç√°r‚ÄîJan√°k built fewer buildings and produced more theoretical work, but his 1913 Fara House in Pelh≈ôimov is a key work in that style. After 1918 Jan√°k and Goƒç√°r developed Cubism into Czech Rondocubism, with decoration taken from folk and nationalist themes, and then subsequently into a purer functionalism. His 1925 Palace Adria is an unusually late example of integrated sculpture. As the chairman of the Czechoslovak Werkbund he drew up the master plan for the 1932 Baba Werkbund Housing Estate, the last of the European housing exhibitions, and also designed 3 of its 32 houses. He was also responsible for the design for the Hussite Church in Vinohrady.The Prague Vitruvius, Pragitecture.eu. Retrieved 22 October 2019.

Pavel Jan√°k was also associated with the functionalist housing project in Prague known as Baba, the \\"Werkbond\\" inspired housing estate located on the outskirts of Prague. Pavel Jan√°k created the Master Plan for this community, and was also in charge of selecting the architects that would be involved. Although Baba survived the World Wars, it is now in danger of historical extinction due to recent renovations and neglect.

Often categorized as a children's novel, it is a fable \\"partly about life, partly about revolution and lots about hope ‚Äì for adults and others including caterpillars who can read\\". The two focal characters are caterpillars named Yellow and Stripe. They begin their search for meaning by attempting to climb to the top of a caterpillar pillar only to discover another destiny.Hope for the Flowers by Trina Paulus : reviews. hopefortheflowers.com The novel has been translated into Spanish, Dutch, German, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, Korean, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, Hebrew, Arabic, Persian, French, Turkish, and Swahili.Interview with Trina Paulus, Author of Hope for the Flowers. www.psychologytoday.com Plot summary It all starts when Stripe, the main character, first hatches from an egg. He begins his life by eating the leaf he was born on. He realizes that there must be \\"more\\" to life than just eating leaves. He senses there must be a way to get up into the sky. He searches for a way and finds himself at the base of a pillar made up of caterpillars. They are all struggling to get up into the sky as well. Here he meets Yellow who also wants to get up into the sky by climbing to the top of the pillar. But she feels bad about what must be done to achieve this goal. You have to literally step on and climb over all the other caterpillars who are also trying to reach the top of the pillar. The two of them eventually decide to stop climbing and go back down the pillar. They live together for a while. But Stripe's curiosity and unrest overcome him and he decides that he must get to the top of the pillar. Stripe says good-bye to Yellow. He focuses, adapts, and drives to reach the top, and eventually he succeeds at being on the top of the caterpillar pillar. This results in disillusionment, as he takes in a vast vista of other caterpillar pillars. Is this all there is at the top? He has not really gotten in to the sky. He just has a view of other caterpillars struggling to reach the top of their respective caterpillar pillars. Yellow, however, has followed her instincts, continues to eat and then spins a cocoon. She eventually emerges from the cocoon transformed into a butterfly and flies into the sky effortlessly. She has found the real answer to the feeling that there must be more to life than eating leaves, and who caterpillars really are. She is waiting for the disillusioned Stripe as he descends the pillar and eventually reaches the ground again. She shows Stripe her empty cocoon, and he eventually realizes what he needs to do. Stripe makes a cocoon of his own. Yellow waits for him. Stripe emerges transformed into a butterfly, and they fly off together.

PETs allow online users to protect the privacy of their personally identifiable information (PII) provided to and handled by services or applications. PETs use techniques to minimize possession of personal data without losing the functionality of an information system. Goals of PETs The objective of PETs is to protect personal data and ensure the users of technology that their information is confidential and management of data protection is a priority to the organizations who withhold responsibility for any PII - allowing users to take one or more of the following actions related to their personal data sent to and used by, online service providers, merchants or other users. The goal of privacy-enhancing technologies include increasing control over personal data sent to, and used by, online service providers and merchants (or other online users)(self-determination). PETs aim to minimize personal data collected and used by service providers and merchants, use pseudonyms or anonymous data credentials to provide anonymity, and strive to achieve informed consent about giving personal data to online service providers and merchants.The EU PRIME research project's Vision on privacy enhanced identity management In Privacy Negotiations, consumers and service providers establish, maintain, and refine privacy policies as individualized agreements through the ongoing choice among service alternatives, therefore providing the possibility to negotiate the terms and conditions of giving personal data to online service providers and merchants (data handling/privacy policy negotiation). Within private negotiations, the transaction partners may additionally bundle the personal information collection and processing schemes with monetary or non-monetary rewards.Key Facts on Privacy Negotiations PETs provide the possibility to remotely audit the enforcement of these terms and conditions at the online service providers and merchants (assurance), allow users to log, archive and look up past transfers of their personal data, including what data has been transferred, when, to whom and under what conditions, and facilitate the use of their legal rights of data inspection, correction and deletion. Families of PETs Privacy-enhancing Technologies can be distinguished based on their assumption. Soft privacy technologies Where it is assumed that the third-party can be trusted for the processing of data. This model is based on compliance, consent, control and audit. Example technologies are access control, differential privacy, and tunnel encryption (SSL/TLS). Hard privacy technologies No single entity can violate the privacy of the user. It assumes that third-parties cannot be trusted. The data protection goal is data minimization and reduction of the trust in third-parties. Examples of such technologies include onion routing and the secret ballot used for democratic elections. Existing PETs PETs have evolved since their first appearance in the 1980s. At intervals, review articles have been published on the state of privacy technology: * A principal, though fundamentally theoretical overview of terminology and principal anonymization technology is found in Pfitzmann & Hansen's terminology of anonymity.Pfitzmann, Andreas and Hansen, Marit (2010) A terminology for talking about privacy by data minimization: Anonymity, Unlinkability, Undetectability, Unobservability, Pseudonymity, and Identity Management, v0.34, Report, University of Dresden, http://dud.inf.tu- dresden.de/Anon_Terminology.shtml, accessed 09-Dec-2019 * In 1997, a report by Goldberg, Wagner and Brewer at the University of California in Berkeley summarized PETs.Ian Goldberg, David Wagner and Eric Brewer (1997) Privacy-enhancing technologies for the Internet, University of California, Berkeley, https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a391508.pdf, accessed 2019-12-09 * In 2003, Borking, Blarkom and Olk reviewed the technologies from a data protection perspective in their Handbook of privacy enhancing technologies. * In 2007, Fritsch published an historic, taxonomic and practical overview of contemporary privacy-enhancing technology for the Internet for the research project PETWeb.Fritsch, Lothar (2007): State of the Art of Privacy-enhancing Technology (PET) - Deliverable D2.1 of the PETweb project; NR Report 1013, Norsk Regnesentral, , 34 pages, https://www.nr.no/publarchive?query=4589, accessed 2019-12-09 * In 2008, Fritsch and Abie documented the gap between implemented PETs and their successful deployment in a research roadmap for PETs.Lothar Fritsch, Habtamu Abie: Towards a Research Road Map for the Management of Privacy Risks in Information Systems.

A review article by Janic et. al. summarizes the developments. Murmann and Fischer-H√ºbner published in 2017 a review of transparency tools. Example PETs Examples of existing privacy enhancing technologies are: *Communication anonymizers hiding the real online identity (email address, IP address, etc.) and replacing it with a non-traceable identity (disposable / one-time email address, random IP address of hosts participating in an anonymising network, pseudonym, etc.). They can be applied to email, Web browsing, P2P networking, VoIP, Chat, instant messaging, etc. *Shared bogus online accounts. One person creates an account for MSN, providing bogus data for Name, address, phone number, preferences, life situation etc. They then publish their user-IDs and passwords on the Internet. Everybody can now use this account comfortably. Thereby the user is sure that there is no personal data about him or her in the account profile. (Moreover, he is freed from the hassle of having to register at the site himself.) *Obfuscation refers to the many practices of adding distracting or misleading data to a log or profile, which may be especially useful for frustrating precision analytics after data has already been lost or disclosed. Its effectiveness against humans is questioned, but it has greater promise against shallow algorithms. Obfuscating also hides personal information or sensitive data through computer algorithms and masking techniques. This technique can also involve adding misleading or distracting data or information so it's harder for an attacker to obtain the needed data. *Access to personal data: The service provider's infrastructure allows users to inspect, correct or delete all their data stored at the service provider. *Enhanced privacy ID (EPID) is a digital signature algorithm supporting anonymity. Unlike traditional digital signature algorithms (e.g., PKI), in which each entity has a unique public verification key and a unique private signature key, EPID provides a common group public verification key associated with many of unique private signature keys. EPID was created so that a device could prove to an external party what kind of device it is (and optionally what software is running on the device) without needing to also reveal exact identity, i.e., to prove you are an authentic member of a group without revealing which member. It has been in use since 2008. *Homomorphic encryption is a form of encryption that allows computation on ciphertexts. *Zero-knowledge proof is a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that they know a value x, without conveying any information apart from the fact that they know the value x. *Secure multi-party computation is a method for parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private. *Non-interactive zero-knowledge proof (NIZKs) are zero-knowledge proofs that require no interaction between the prover and verifier. *Format-preserving encryption (FPE), refers to encrypting in such a way that the output (the ciphertext) is in the same format as the input (the plaintext) *Blinding is a cryptography technique by which an agent can provide a service to a client in an encoded form without knowing either the real input or the real output. * Differential Privacy: An algorithm is constrained so that the results or outputs of a data analysis can't tell if a certain individuals information is being used to analyze and form the results. This technique focuses on large databases and hides the identity of individual \\"inputs\\" who might have private data and privacy concerns, * Pseudonymization: This technique is a data management technique that replaces an individual's identity or personal information with an artificial identifiers known as Pseudonyms. This de-identification method enables contents and fields of information to be covered up so as to deter attacks and hackers from obtaining important information. These Pseudonyms can be either placed in groups or for individual pieces o information. Overall, they serve to discourage information stealing while also maintaining data integrity and data analysis. Future PETs Examples of privacy enhancing technologies that are being researched or developed includeThe EU PRIME research project's White Paper (Version 2) limited disclosure technology, anonymous credentials such as online car rental, negotiation and enforcement of data handling conditions, and data transaction log. Limited disclosure technology provides a way of protecting individuals' privacy by allowing them to share only enough personal information with service providers to complete an interaction or transaction. This technology is also designed to limit tracking and correlation of users‚Äô interactions with these third parties. Limited disclosure uses cryptographic techniques and allows users to retrieve data that is vetted by a provider, to transmit that data to a relying party, and have these relying parties trust the authenticity and integrity of the data.Gartner IT Glossary Anonymous credentials are asserted properties or rights of the credential holder that don't reveal the true identity of the holder; the only information revealed is what the holder of the credential is willing to disclose. The assertion can be issued by the user himself/herself, by the provider of the online service or by a third party (another service provider, a government agency, etc.). For example: Online car rental. The car rental agency doesn't need to know the true identity of the customer. It only needs to make sure that the customer is over 23 (as an example), that the customer has a drivers license, health insurance (i.e. for accidents, etc.), and that the customer is paying. Thus there is no real need to know the customers name nor their address or any other personal information. Anonymous credentials allow both parties to be comfortable: they allow the customer to only reveal so much data which the car rental agency needs for providing its service (data minimization), and they allow the car rental agency to verify their requirements and get their money. When ordering a car online, the user, instead of providing the classical name, address and credit card number, provides the following credentials, all issued to pseudonyms (i.e. not to the real name of the customer): * An assertion of minimal age, issued by the state, proving that the holder is older than 23 (note: the actual age is not provided) * A driving licence, i.e. an assertion, issued by the motor vehicle control agency, that the holder is entitled to drive cars * A proof of insurance, issued by the health insurance * Digital cash Negotiation and enforcement of data handling conditions. Before ordering a product or service online, the user and the online service provider or merchant negotiate the type of personal data that is to be transferred to the service provider. This includes the conditions that shall apply to the handling of the personal data, such as whether or not it may be sent to third parties (profile selling) and under what conditions (e.g. only while informing the user), or at what time in the future it shall be deleted (if at all). After the transfer of personal data took place, the agreed upon data handling conditions are technically enforced by the infrastructure of the service provider, which is capable of managing and processing and data handling obligations. Moreover, this enforcement can be remotely audited by the user, for example by verifying chains of certification based on Trusted computing modules or by verifying privacy seals/labels that were issued by third party auditing organisations (e.g. data protection agencies). Thus instead of the user having to rely on the mere promises of service providers not to abuse personal data, users will be more confident about the service provider adhering to the negotiated data handling conditions Lastly, the data transaction log allows users the ability to log the personal data they send to service provider(s), the time in which they do it, and under what conditions. These logs are stored and allow users to determine what data they have sent to whom, or they can establish the type of data that is in possession by a specific service provider. This leads to more transparency, which is a pre-requisite of being in control.

The All-Africa Peoples Conference was conceived to include social groups, including ethnic communities and anti-colonial political parties and African organizations such as Labor Unions and other significant associations in the late 1950s and early 1960s both in Africa and the Diaspora such as Europe, North America and South America. The All-Africa Peoples Conference was conceived to represent the position that Africa should be returned to the peoples and groups, such as ethnic communities, from who it was grabbed by colonialism. The idea was mooted in Accra, Ghana, in April 1958 by John Kale from Uganda. This was at the end of first Africa Heads of State Conference in Accra in March 1958. John Kale, then operating from exile in Egypt, who was one of the organizers of the first Africa Heads of State Conference, was already the initiating secretary (and later Chairman) of the African Liberation Committee, the Africa Executive of Afro-Asian Solidarity which had its secretariat in Cairo and shortly after the Africa representative on the World Peace Council on which he was the Vice President. For Kale the main reason of the parallel organization to the then just concluded independent Africa Heads of States was that it had brought together only nine then independent African states, excluding the majority of the African peoples both in the non-independent countries and in the Diaspora. The First All-Africa Peoples' Conference was attended by delegates from independence movements in areas still under European colonial rule, as well as by delegates from the independent African countries, including representatives of the governing parties of some of those countries. In the Conference's own words, it was open to \\"all national political parties and national trade union congresses or equivalent bodies or organizations that subscribe to the aims and objects of the conference.\\"AAPC amended Constitution, Article III. See Gott, Major and Warner, p, 349. The Conference met three times: December 1958, January 1960, and March 1961; and had a permanent secretariat with headquarters in Accra. Its primary objectives were independence for the colonies, and strengthening of the independent states and resistance to neocolonialism. It tended to be more outspoken in its denunciations of colonialism than the Conference of Independent African States, a contemporary organisation which, being composed of heads of state, was relatively constrained by diplomatic caution. Immanuel Wallerstein says that the All- African Peoples' Conference was the \\"true successor to the Pan-African Congresses.\\" The subject matter and attitudes of the Conference are illustrated by the following excerpt from its second meeting: > The Conference Demands the immediate and unconditional accession to > independence of all the African peoples, and the total evacuation of the > foreign forces of aggression and oppression stationed in Africa; > Proclaims the absolute necessity, in order to resist the imperialist > coalition more effectively and rapidly free all the dependent peoples from > foreign oppression, of coordinating and uniting the forces of all the > Africans, and recommends the African states not to neglect any form of co- > operation in the interest of all the African peoples; > Denounces vigorously the policy of racial discrimination applied by > colonialist and race-conscious minorities in South and East and Central > Africa, and demands the abolition of racial domination in South Africa, the > suppression of the Federation of Nyasaland and Rhodesia, and the immediate > independence of these countries; > Proclaims equality of rights for all the citizens of the free countries > of Africa and the close association of the masses for the building up and > administration of a free and prosperous Africa; > Calls on the peoples of Africa to intensify the struggle for > independence, and insists on the urgent obligation on the independent > nations of Africa to assure them of the necessary aid and > support;...\\"Resolutions adopted by the Second All-African Peoples' > Conference\\", Tunis, 30 January 1960. In Gott, Major and Warner, see p. 350. First Conference: Accra, 8‚Äì13 December 1958 The first conference was preceded by a Preparatory Committee composed of representatives from the eight independent African states‚Äîother than South Africa. (They were Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia, and the United Arab Republic.) The conference itself was attended by delegates from 28 African countries and colonies. The number of delegates was more than 300, and the conference claimed that they represented more than 200 million people from all parts of Africa. Tom Mboya, General Secretary of the Kenya Federation of Labour, was elected chairman. One important discussion was over the legitimacy and desirability of using violence against the colonial powers. It was agreed that violence would be necessary in some cases. Concerning the struggle in Algeria, full support was given to the recently proclaimed Provisional Republican Government (Gouvernement Provisoire de la R√©publique Alg√©rienne‚ÄîGPRA). On the Cameroon, the Conference supported the fight of the UPC maquis, demanding full amnesty and UN-sponsored elections. The Conference considered unity and solidarity to be key strategies in the fight against colonialism and economic domination after colonialism; it called for the establishment of Africa-wide organisations, including trade unions youth groups, and a Bureau of Liberatory Movements. It was at this meeting that the decision was made to establish a permanent secretariat at Accra. The first secretary-general was George Padmore, then living in Ghana. The following year, he died and was replaced by Guinea's Resident Minister in Ghana, Abdoulaye Diallo. Prominent persons at the first Conference included:Houser, No One Can Stop the Rain (1989), p. 70. * Kwame Nkrumah, leader of the newly independent Ghana * Patrice Lumumba, who headed the Congolese delegation * Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia * Hastings Banda of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (and later President of Malawi) * Holden Roberto, using the name Rui Ventura, of Angola International observers came from the Soviet Union (within the Soviet Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee) and the People's Republic of China. Congressman Charles Diggs was in attendance, but without support from the US government.Houser, No One Can Stop the Rain (1989), p. 71. Slogans displayed by Ghanaians holding signs during the Conference:Houser, No One Can Stop the Rain (1989), p. 69. * \\"Hands Off Africa\\" * \\"Africa Must Be Free\\" * \\"Down With Imperialism and Colonialism\\" * \\"We prefer independence with danger to servitude in tranquility\\" Wallerstein summarises by saying: \\"The impact of this and subsequent AAPC meetings on political awareness in Africa is difficult to measure, but nonetheless very real. The AAPC brought many African nationalist leaders into contact for the first time with others who had already won independence for their countries or were in active and violent struggle for it.\\"Wallerstein, p. 34. Second Conference: Tunis, 25‚Äì30 January 1960 One feature of the AAPC was tension between conservative and avant- garde elements. Neither Mboya nor Nkrumah, key leaders at the Accra Conference, attended the second conference in Tunis.Houser, No One Can Stop the Rain (1989), p. 75. The conference adopted a proposal by the Algerians and Moroccans for an \\"international corps of volunteers\\" to go to fight in Algeria in the manner of the International Brigade that had gone to Spain in the 1930s. The Algerian War of Independence was a primary focus of the Conference.Houser, No One Can Stop the Rain (1989), p. 74. Participants in the Congress also joined with 200,000-plus Tunisians in a protest of France's atomic tests in the Sahara. The Conference voiced considerable concern over neocolonialism‚Äîthe tendency of the nominally freed states to actually remain subjugated to the imperialist powers because of economic dependency and other factors. This was expressed, for example, in the Economic and Social Resolution: > Economic and Social Resolution Considering the underdeveloped state of > African economies which is a result of the colonial system and foreign > domination; > Considering the tendency of the colonialist countries to substitute > economic for political domination and thus rob the newly won independence of > the African states of its true content; > Considering also the departmentalisation and lack of harmony existing in > the African economies and the inadequacy of technical cadres and finance; > Considering that economic growth and development constitute the surest > guarantee of the freedom of the African continent; > Considering that foreign Powers sometimes use their economic aid as a > means of endeavouring to divide the African territories and isolate the > Independent States from territories that are still under colonial rule; The > Conference Affirms that independence is a prerequisite to all economic > development; > Declares that the peoples of Africa are determined to work for the > economic development and liberation of Africa, for the benefit and under the > control of the masses; > Recommends to the independent African states: I. The intensification of > their efforts to wrest their respective countries from economic dependence > on the imperialist countries....\\"Resolutions adopted by the Second All- > African Peoples' Conference, Tunis, 30 January 1960\\", in Gott, Major and > Warner, p. 351. The general resolution also spoke on this topic: > The Conference ...recommends the African governments to be active in > liquidating the neo-colonialist groups, particularly any foreign military > establishments on their soil; > Considering moreover the important social and economic \\"enclaves\\" created > by the imperialist countries in Africa in the industrial and agricultural > sectors, by the establishment of special monetary, financial, technical and > social institutions entirely controlled by themselves; > Observing these foreign 'enclaves' result in the exploitation of the > human, vegetable and mineral resources of Africa, and that they have been > installed in the service of foreign economic systems; > Observing further that the existence of these \\"enclaves\\" enables the > imperialist countries to bind the economy of certain African countries very > stringently in the domains of customs, finance, trade, currency, etc.; > Considering on the other hand, that the imperialists are aiming at the > organisation of all these new institutions of domination with each African > people taken separately, while they are themselves co-ordinating strictly > their action in order to present a united front against the efforts of > economic liberation on the part of Africa; > The Conference Affirms the absolute necessity of turning the economy of > the African countries to the profit of its peoples, and of acting with unity > in the economic field, as in the political and cultural fields; > Proposes therefore the creation by all the Independent African States, of > common organisations for the conduct of finance and commerce, and of centres > of social and economic research, for the purpose of studying the forms of > technical assistance to Africa and of training the technicians whom Africa > needs to ensure her economic development and her social progress; > Proclaims finally the irrevocable character of the movement towards > African independence, liberty and unity; ...\\"Resolutions adopted by the > Second All-African Peoples' Conference\\", Tunis, 30 January 1960. In Gott, > Major and Warner, pp. 350, 1. The Conference was particularly critical of the French government for taking measures to limit the sovereignty of its territories in North Africa that were being decolonised. > Considering the existence of the French Community, a new form of > imperialist domination, and the present attempts of the French Government to > impose upon countries associated with this community and on the threshold of > independence, bonds of a kind which would deprive them of true national > sovereignty;... Third Conference: Cairo, 25‚Äì31 March 1961 The mood at this conference was more militant than at the second conference, partly because some conservative groups had withdrawn, and partly because the conference occurred during the crisis in the Congo. The Congolese issue was raised by the Secretary-General, Abdoulaye Diallo, in his opening address: > Today there are two forces existing in the Congo; forces which represent the > imperialist interests, and forces which represent the interests of the > Congolese people. The former are led by Messrs. Kasavubu, Tshombe, and their > cohorts; the latter, or in other words ours, are led by Mr. Gizenga, who has > the sympathy of all the people and the support of the immense majority of > the population.Quoted in Wallerstein, p. 51. Later, the Conference adopted a very strong resolution on the Congo: > The Conference denounces the role played by General Kettani in the > degradation of the situation in the Congo and demands the dismissal of Dag > Hammarskj√∂ld equally responsible for the murder of Lumumba.Quoted in > Wallerstein pp. 51, 2. In another clause Kasavubu, Mobutu, Tshombe and Kalonji were denounced for their role. The Conference proclaimed Lumumba the \\"hero of Africa\\". The issue of neocolonialism was again raised by the Conference; its four-page Resolution on Neocolonialism is cited as a landmark for having presented a collectively arrived at definition of neocolonialism and a description of its main features.Wallerstein, p. 52: \\"It attempted the one serious, collectively agreed upon definition of neocolonialism, the key concept in the armory of the revolutionary core of the movement for African unity.\\" Also William D. Graf, review of Yolamu R. Barongo, Neocolonialism and African Politics: a Survey of the Impact of Neocolonialism on African Political Behaviour (1980); Canadian Journal of African Studies, p. 601: \\"The term itself originated in Africa, probably with Nkrumah, and received collective recognition at the 1961 All- African People's Conference.\\" Internal contradictions within the AAPC led to its eventual demise. Wallerstein has described the make up of the AAPC around the time of the Third Congress: > The AAPC had become the meeting ground of three groups: African nationalists > in non-independent countries, whose revolutionary ardor was often tactical > and hence temporary; leaders of the so-called revolutionary African states, > whose militancy was often tempered by the exigencies of diplomacy and the > reality of world economic pressures; African radical-nationalist opposition > movements in independent states, which states were considered by these > opposition movements as clients or \\"puppets\\" of the West. This latter group > (which included the UPC, the Sawaba of Niger led by Djibo Bakary, the > Moroccan Union Nationale des Forces Populaires [UNFP] represented by Mehdi > Ben Barka) was perhaps the most genuinely and the most persistently > militant. It also had the least real power. Therefore, while this third > group often dominated the conferences and gave the tone to the resolutions, > it was the second group (the governments) that dominated the structure and > held the purse strings.Wallerstein, p. 52. The difference between the two groups was to prove fatal to the AAPC, as radical pronouncements by the Conference began to pose difficulties for its governmental members in their diplomatic relations with the more conservative African states. Although it was decided at the 1961 Conference that a fourth Conference be held at Bamako, Mali, in February 1962, that meeting never took place because the host government, Mali, and the Secretary-General's government, Guinea, were reluctant to proceed with it. Wallerstein says that \\"The Casablanca governments were content to let the AAPC disappear quietly in their attempts to come to terms with the other African governments.\\" Notes Sources * Gott, Richard, John Major and Geoffrey Warner (eds), Documents on International Affairs 1960.

It is a part of the Seventh-day Adventist education system, the world's second largest Christian school system.http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2010/1115/For-real- education-reform-take-a-cue-from-the-Adventists\\"the second largest Christian school system in the world has been steadily outperforming the national average ‚Äì across all demographics.\\" The school was founded in 1910, and was previously known as Portland Union Academy, serving grades K-12. The name changed when the elementary section became its own school, Portland Adventist Elementary School in 1975. During the process, the high school section was renamed Portland Adventist Academy. The main building on campus was built in 1963.  History   Legal proceedings over sports  In 1996, Portland Adventist's boys basketball team qualified for the state tournament operated by the Oregon School Activities Association (OSAA). The school requested the OSAA allow the team to avoid playing a game during the Sabbath for their beliefs which runs from sundown on Friday until sundown of Saturday. The OSAA granted the request for scheduling Friday games of the tournament, but informed Portland Adventist that they could not change the schedule for Saturday games and the school would need to forfeit a Saturday game if needed. Portland Adventist won their Friday game and was able to play on Saturday after sundown and won the state championship for the 2a division. The OSAA then received complaints from other schools and refused to accommodate Portland Adventist in later tournaments.Montgomery v. Board of Education, 188 Ore. App. 63, 71 P.3d 94 (2003) Oregon Judicial Department. In 2000, Portland Adventist students and parents, represented by volunteer lawyers from the Oregon affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), filed a discrimination complaint against the OSAA with the Oregon State Board of Education. Oregon Superintendent of Public Instruction Stan Bunn denied the appeal for the State Board of Education in February 2002. The students and parents then asked for judicial review of the State Board of Education's decision that the OSAA did not unlawfully discriminate against Portland Adventist's religious beliefs. In June 2003, the Oregon Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the students and sent the case back to the State Board to reconsider the students' request. The OSAA then reconsidered the request of the Portland Adventist students to not schedule games on their Sabbath. The OSAA determined the request was too much of a hardship, and the State School Board agreed, denying the Portland Adventist students' request once again. The students and their parents again sought court review, and the Oregon Court of Appeals again agreed with them in a March 2006 decision.Nakashima v. Bd. of Educ., 204 Ore. App. 535, 131 P.3d 749 (2006) Oregon Judicial Department. In June 2006, the court again rejected the OSAA's arguments and found the OSAA's denial in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 659.850(2). On December 5, 2006, the Oregon Supreme Court took the case on an appeal from the OSAA.Nakashima v. Board of Education, 342 Ore. 116; 149 P.3d 138 (2006) Oregon Judicial Department. During the 2007‚Äì2008 season, while the principal case was still pending in the appellate courts, the OSAA continued to refuse to allow the Portland Adventist team to enter the state tournament. A number of students and parents filed a new case in an Oregon trial court, along with a motion for temporary restraining order requiring the OSAA to allow the school to enter the tournament. A Multnomah County circuit court judge granted the motion, and the Oregon Supreme Court denied the OSAA's appeal from the temporary relief on February 15, 2008. A decision by the Supreme Court in the principal case was announced on May 8, 2008, in which the court affirmed the Court of Appeals. It held that the OSAA had violated the statute that barred religious discrimination in school activities, and it sent the case back to the State Board of Education to review the OSAA's decision using the correct legal guidelines.Nakashima v. Bd. of Educ., 344 Or. 497 (2008) Oregon Judicial Department. The decision was written by justice Virginia Linder.  Reconstruction  An expansion of the school's campus starting in 2007 was influenced by the extension of TriMet's MAX Light Rail to Clackamas Town Center. A new station near the entrance of the school meant there was a need for a solution for tighter campus security from the heightened crime and unwanted visitor potential.

In this method, cells are collected from milk ducts in the breast. The procedure involves inserting a catheter (tube) into the nipple, which releases a small amount of salt water into the duct. The water picks up breast cells and the entire fluid is then retrieved and sent to be examined for cells, which are checked under a microscope. Apart from clinical breast examination and mammography, ductal lavage can also be used to detect breast cancer.  Procedure  Ductal lavage is a non-invasive screening procedure. It is used to detect precancerous and cancerous cells in the breast ducts. It is a safe and well-tolerated procedure. Some doctors might apply anesthetic cream to numb the nipple area. In ductal lavage, the doctor applies suction to the nipple in order to bring out fluid from the milk ducts that eventually end at the nipple. A micro-catheter is inserted into the milk duct and the fluid is washed into the duct to rinse out the cells. The fluid is then retrieved from the nipple and sent for laboratory evaluation. This procedure is also called a \\"Breast Pap-Smear\\" by some doctors.  Ductal Lavage and Detection for Breast Cancer  There is much controversy around whether or not does ductal lavage actually help detect breast cancer. Earlier researches, in particular, have deemed it has a good tool for risk assessment for breast cancer. Though a 2004 study led by researchers at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, which also appeared in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, argued that ductal lavage might not be an effective method for detecting breast cancer. Seema Khan, M.D., the lead author of the study and the interim director of the Lynn Sage Comprehensive Breast Center and surgeon at Northwestern Memorial Hospital explained, \\"This study raises serious questions about the utility of ductal lavage as a cancer detection test and shows us that women should not be offered ductal lavage as a method of breast cancer detection. Mammography and physical examination remain the most effective methods of early detection. Ductal lavage does remain promising as a method for obtaining more information about the level of breast cancer risk.\\" References  External links  * Ductal lavage entry in the public domain NCI Cancer Dictionary Breast procedures ","title":"Ductal lavage"},{"id":"14389617","text":"Clix is a brand of malt liquor made by the Grand Valley Brewing Company in 1937.

It was the first Santa Fe \\"Chief\\" outside the Chicago‚ÄìLos Angeles routes. The Santa Fe conveyed the Texas Chief to Amtrak in 1971, which renamed it the Lone Star in 1974. The train was taken off in 1979.  History   Santa Fe  The Santa Fe introduced the Texas Chief on April 3, 1948. The train competed with the Texas Eagle (Missouri Pacific Railroad) and the Texas Special (Missouri‚ÄìKansas‚ÄìTexas Railroad/St. Louis‚ÄìSan Francisco Railway). The journey from Chicago to Galveston required 26 hours 15 minutes, ten hours faster the previous service on the route. Service to Dallas, Texas, began on December 5, 1955. Patronage was strong; historian Keith L. Bryant Jr. credited the Texas Chief with causing the withdrawal of the Texas Special. The Texas Chief was the first major train outside the Chicago‚ÄìLos Angeles route to carry the \\"Chief\\" moniker popularized by the Chief and Super Chief.  Amtrak  The general decline in passenger traffic in the 1960s led to cutbacks on the Texas Chief. Service south of Houston, Texas, ended in April 1967. The Dallas section ended on August 4, 1968. Amtrak retained the Texas Chief between Chicago and Houston. Santa Fe was planning to discontinue the service unless it was included in the new national system. In 1973 Amtrak proposed re-routing the Texas Chief to serve Dallas. This new route would use the Southern Pacific between Dallas and Houston. Opposition from the SP killed the plan. In 1974 the Santa Fe withdrew permission to use the name due to a perceived decline in service, so Amtrak renamed it the Lone Star.  Rolling stock  The Texas Chief debuted with new equipment, including coaches, Pullman sleeping cars, a dining car, and a lounge. In 1966 the Santa Fe assigned its 10 new GE U28CG diesel locomotives to the Texas Chief. After 1968 excess Hi-Level coaches from the El Capitan and San Francisco Chief could be found on the Texas Chief, along with Big Dome full-length dome lounges from the discontinued Chief. The Texas Chief featured a wide variety of equipment during its short Amtrak tenure. In addition to ex-Santa Fe equipment such as Hi-Level coaches and Big Domes, Amtrak assigned Vista-Dome dormitory-buffet-lounge-observation cars from the former California Zephyr.

The eastern terminus of NY 146B was in the hamlet of Groom Corners, where it met Miller and Sugarhill roads. NY 146B was assigned and removed . Its former routing is now the western portion of County Route 91 (CR 91). Route description Former western terminus of NY 146B at NY 146 in Rexford NY 146B began at an intersection with NY 146 in Rexford, a small riverside hamlet in the town of Clifton Park. The route headed southeastward on Riverview Road, following the northern bank of the Mohawk River (also part of the Erie Canal) through the town. It passed to the south of the Edison Country Club and remained on the riverbank to an intersection with Grooms Road approximately southeast of Rexford. Here, NY 146B turned eastward to follow Grooms Road to the hamlet of Groom Corners, a community based around the intersection of Grooms, Miller and Sugarhill roads. NY 146B ended at this junction; however, Grooms Road continued eastward to a junction with U.S. Route 9 (US 9) in the town of Halfmoon. History On July 11, 1916, the state of New York let a contract for improving a series of roadways linking Groom Corners to Waite Corners by way of Rexford Flats (now Rexford). Approximately half of the project was complete by 1920, while the remainder was completed by 1926. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, the portion of the Groom Corners‚ÄìWaite Corners highway from Rexford to Waite Corners became part of the new NY 146. The remainder of the highway from Rexford to Groom Corners was designated as NY 146B, a spur route of NY 146, . NY 146B remained unchanged until , when the designation was removed from the highway.

Schultz was a member of the Cleveland Rams team that won the 1945 NFL Championship. During his years after the NFL he worked as a football coach, game official, and automobile dealer in Eureka, California.

As was the case with most football players of his era, Schultz played on both the offensive and defensive sides of the ball, gaining particular accolades for his play as an offensive left guard. Schultz was also named the Beavers' \\"Most Aggressive Lineman\\" following the 1939 season and had his named inscribed at the top of the new Otto Sitton Memorial Plaque as a permanent remembrance of this honor.\\"Schultz Named Most Aggressive Lineman at OSC,\\" Klamath News, vol. 17, no. 168 (June 1, 1940), pg. 8.

In October 1944, Schultz was at the epicenter of a brief player strike that rocked the Card-Pitt team. Together with star halfback Johnny Butler and fullback Johnny Grigas, Schultz was fined $200 by coaches Walt Kiesling and Phil Handler for alleged \\"indifferent play\\" following a loss to the Chicago Bears.\\"Star Back Suspended in Player Strike,\\" Albany Democrat-Herald, Oct. 19, 1944, pg. 8. The trio protested the unfairness of the relatively massive penalty and on October 18 the entire team refused to practice, forcing a meeting between players and club management.

Although he remained a cavalry commander in the Peninsular War between 1811 and 1813, the British commander Wellington became disillusioned with Long's abilities. Wellington's opinion was never expressed directly, though when the Prince Regent manoeuvred his favourite, Colquhoun Grant into replacing Long as a cavalry brigade commander, Wellington conspicuously made no effort to retain Long. Other senior officers, including Sir William Beresford and the Duke of Cumberland, expressed their dissatisfaction with Long's abilities. The celebrated historian, and Peninsula veteran, Sir William Napier was a severe critic of Beresford's record as army commander during the Albuera Campaign; in criticising Beresford he involved Long's opinions as part of his argument. The publication of Napier's history led to a long running and acrimonious argument in print between Beresford and his partisans on one side, with Napier and Long's nephew Charles Edward Long (Long having died before the controversy reached the public arena) on the other.Napier, W.F.P. History of the War in the Peninsula and the South of France 1807-1814, London 1828-1840, Vol. III (2nd Ed.), pp. xxi-xxv, also A Letter to Lord Viscount Beresford in Napier, Vol. VI, pp. xxxv-xxxvi. Recently, Long's performance as a cavalry general has received more favourable comment in Ian Fletcher's revisionist account of the British cavalry in the Napoleonic period.Fletcher, I. Galloping at Everything: The British Cavalry in the Peninsula and at Waterloo 1808-15, Spellmount, Staplehurst (1999). Background and early military career Long was born the elder of twin sons to Jamaican planter Edward Long and his wife Mary at Chichester in 1771. Long received a formal education, attending Dr Thomson's School in Kensington until age nine and then being sent to Harrow School until 18 in 1789. After three years at the University of G√∂ttingen studying military theory, Long was commissioned into the 1st King's Dragoon Guards as a cornet in 1791. With the aid of his family's substantial financial resources, Long had been promoted to captain by November 1793 and served with his regiment in Flanders during the Duke of York's unsuccessful campaign there.Long, Robert Ballard, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, H. M. Chichester, Retrieved 27 November 2007 In the winter of 1794/95, Long had left his regiment and was attached to the staff of General Sir George Don during the retreat into Germany and return to England. Uniform of a colonel of British hussars circa 1807 (A portrait of Henry, Lord Paget, later 1st Marquess of Anglesey) Following his arrival, Long spent time as aide-de-camp to General Sir William Pitt who commanded the defences of Portsmouth and the friendship between the two men served Long well in his future career. By the middle of 1796 Long had again transferred however, joining the Hanoverian Army first as a non-serving officer in the York Rangers and then in command of the Hompesch Mounted Riflemen with a commission he purchased from Baron Hompesch himself for ¬£2,000. This regiment was amongst those dispatched under Sir John Moore in putting down the Irish Rebellion of 1798, Long serving in the town of Wexford. At the conclusion of the rebellion, Long served with the York Hussars, another Hanoverian cavalry unit at Weymouth until the Peace of Amiens. Long spent the peace studying at the Senior Division of the new Royal Military College at High Wycombe, where he became friends with its lieutenant-governor John Le Marchant, and at the return of war joined the 16th Light Dragoons as a lieutenant colonel, transferring to the 15th Light Dragoons in 1805 under the Duke of Cumberland. It was with this regiment that Long caused the first of his many upsets, almost immediately falling out with his superior officer. The situation deteriorated so much that the two both attempted to command the regiment without consulting each other, resulting in years of arguments and hostility between the two. Part of the friction was due to Long's objection to Cumberland's penchant for excessive corporal punishments, such as 'picketing.'In the punishment termed 'picketing' the miscreant, or victim, was suspended by the wrists a short distance above the floor, immediately below his bare feet a wooden stake (picket) sharpened at both ends was driven into the ground. The victim could relieve the pain of suspension only by putting weight on the sharpened stake and was thus given a choice between two agonies. Long was with the regiment for two years during which time it was remodelled as a hussar formation. Eventually the name too changed, becoming the 15th 'King's' Light Dragoons (Hussars).The 7th and 10th Light Dragoons were converted to hussars at the same time as the 15th, the 18th Light Dragoons followed suit somewhat later; the 'conversion' amounted to little more than a change of uniform and the adoption of moustaches. Long is mentioned frequently in the anonymously authored book \\"Jottings from my Sabretasch.\\" The author, a troop sergeant of the 15th Light Dragoons, looked upon Long as a peerless commander. He ascribed virtually all of the superiorities of organisation or training that he claimed for his regiment, over the rest of the British cavalry, to Long's initiatives when in command.Anonymous, Jottings from My Sabretasch, by a Chelsea Pensioner, London (1847). Peninsular War In 1808 with the dispatch of Sir John Moore's army to Spain, Long again applied for a position and was welcomed by his former commander, who by the time of Long's arrival was preparing to fight the desperate rearguard action of the Battle of Corunna amid the ruins of his campaign. Long did not have a command during the battle but instead served on his commander's staff, presumably being present at Moore's death. Returning to England, Long was soon recruited for Lord Chatham's disastrous Walcheren Expedition as adjutant-general. The campaign was an abject failure due to reconnaissance and supply failures, heavy rain, strong French resistance and a devastating epidemic of what was called at the time \\"ague,\\" almost certainly malaria, which killed a large proportion of the men garrisoning the town of Flushing (Vlissingen). William Carr Beresford In 1810 Long returned to active service joining Wellington's army in the Peninsula. He took command of the cavalry (one British brigade, one Portuguese brigade and an unbrigaded British regiment) of the army of Sir William Beresford during the operations surrounding the first Allied siege of Badajoz. Long took command of the cavalry on 21 March 1811, a mere four days before they were to see action. The cavalry clash at Campo Mayor on 25 March 1811, was to become a very controversial action. Beresford considered that Long had lost control of his light cavalry, which had pursued fleeing French cavalry for up to seven miles until they came within range of the fortress guns of Badajoz. The historian Charles Oman later sided with Beresford in calling the Campo Mayor action reckless, though without naming Long.Oman, Charles. Wellington's Army, 1809-1814. London: Greenhill, (1913) 1993. , p. 105. Beresford also claimed that his taking personal command of the heavy dragoons had prevented Long from ordering them to attempt a suicidal charge against French infantry squares . However, the army as whole felt differently and sided with the 13th Light Dragoons who had pursued the French. The pursuit took place after the 13th had made an epic charge causing no less than six enemy squadrons to rout, having only two and a half squadrons themselves. In contrast to Oman's opinion, the historian Sir John Fortescue wrote, \\"Of the performance of Thirteenth, who did not exceed two hundred men, in defeating twice or thrice their numbers single-handed, it is difficult to speak too highly.\\"Fletcher, p. 140. Long was of the opinion, and was subsequently supported in this by the historian Sir William Napier, that if Beresford had released the British brigade of heavy dragoons he would have been able to force the whole French column to surrender.McGuffie, T.H (Ed). Peninsular Cavalry General (1811-1813): The Correspondence of Lieutenant-General Robert Ballard Long, London (1951). Letter to C.B. Long, St. Vicente, near Elvas, 28 March 1811, pp. 73-81. This was the start of the abrasive and acrimonious relationship between Beresford and Long. At the subsequent clash at Los Santos (16 April 1811) Long managed to retain the heavy dragoons under his command and inflicted a reverse on the French cavalry, the French 2nd Hussars suffering considerable losses. On two subsequent occasions, Long was ordered to withdraw from action without engaging whilst still delaying the French through manoeuvre, though Long maintained that he was given orders merely to fall back to a certain position, with no mention being made about delaying the French advance. On each occasion Long withdrew too quickly and gave the French time to respond, apparent failures which frustrated Beresford enough to take advantage of Long's junior rank in relation to allied Spanish cavalry generals to relieve Long of his command, on the day of the Battle of Albuera, and replace him with the more senior general William Lumley.Fletcher (p. 149 - referencing Fortesque) directly attributes the precipitate withdrawal of Long's men back over to the Albuera town side of the river, in the opening stages of the Battle of Albuera, to mistakes made by Beresford's staff officers, two of whom gave conflicting orders to Long. The decision to replace Long, a brigadier, with Lumley, who was a major general, seems to have been made with Long's acquiescence. However, Beresford's timing for this replacement to be made active, during the opening stages of the Battle of Albuera, was taken as a mortal insult by Long. Long subsequently took an honourable part in the battle, though under Lumley's command. Long also served under Lumley at the Battle of Usagre on 25 May 1811, when the British cavalry neatly trapped two regiments of French dragoons at a bridge, inflicting severe casualties. The right-hand figure is a KGL hussar, Long commanded KGL hussars at Elvas and, with greater success, Arroyo dos Molinos Long was given command of a light cavalry brigade in June 1811, following his promotion to major general, these troops were involved in a skirmish near Elvas, where a picket of around fifty men of the 11th Light Dragoons was captured (only one man escaped).The fault behind this loss seems to be shared between a number of participants. The picket was placed in its poor position, in a loop of a river with only one possible direction of retreat, at the order of Sir Stapleton Cotton the commander of the cavalry. Long, as brigadier, made the picket too strong, and was criticised by Wellington on this account, he also did not ensure that the pickets of the 11th LD and the adjoining King's German Legion (KGL) 2nd Hussars remained in contact. The captain commanding the picket of the 11th LD apparently ignored the sounds of the KGL hussars engaged in skirmishing with French cavalry to his right for over an hour. Also he mistook a squadron of French cavalry, moving to cut him off from his supports, for allied Portuguese coming to his assistance. The French were allowed to close with the picket until the British dragoons stood no chance of escaping. See Fletcher, and Gleig, George Robert, The Light Dragoon (the Journals of George Farmer), Henry Colburn, Publisher, Great Marlborough Street, London (1844) reprinted . McGuffie (p. 111) adds further details to the incident, Captain Lutyens who commanded the picket, was a favourite of the Duke of York (his former private secretary) and had been recommended to Wellington as a particularly keen and intelligent officer. This, combined with Wellington being informed about the incident by Benjamin D'Urban, a partisan of Beresford, may have limited the level of criticism directed at Lutyens and Cotton and, therefore, inflated that directed at Long. A soldier of the KGL hussars had deserted to the French just prior to the incident and it seems likely that the French were aware of the position of the picket and its vulnerability. Wellington was present on this occasion and gave Long a strongly worded reprimand which effectively stalemated his career. Long's political friends were, however, too strong at this stage to allow his recall from active service and therefore Long maintained his brigade command. He commanded the cavalry under Sir Rowland Hill at Arroyo dos Molinos, where a whole French infantry division and several regiments of cavalry were trapped and destroyed as fighting units. Long's cavalry charged and broke the French cavalry and captured over 200 of them plus three pieces of artillery (General Bron, commanding the French cavalry, and the Prince of Aremberg, commander of the 27th Chasseurs, were also captured).Beamish, pp. 22-24 Long commanded a brigade (consisting of a single regiment - the 13th Light Dragoons) at the Battle of Vitoria in 1813.Historical Record of the Thirteenth Light Dragoons (1842) John W. Parker (publishers), London. pp. 57-58. He fought at the Battle of the Pyrenees later in the same year. When Marshal Soult's large-scale attack across the Pyrenees was launched, on 25 July 1813, it caught Wellington's forces off guard and in an extended state. Long's brigade was acting as the vital link between the two main bodies of Anglo-allied troops. It was in this situation that Long performed the most important service in his active military career. General Lowry Cole sent a dispatch to Wellington to say that a French army of about 35,000 men had forced him from his defensive position and that he was falling back. The dispatch came into Long's hands and he, upon his own initiative, opened it and made a copy to be sent to his immediate superior Sir Rowland Hill. Hill then forwarded the dispatch to Wellington who had recently moved his headquarters. The original copy of the dispatch went to the location Wellington's previous headquarters and did not reach him that evening. Long's intelligent actions allowed Wellington time to react to Soult's movements; had any appreciable delay occurred before Wellington became apprised of the situation the results could have been disastrous for the allied army.Oman, Vol VI p. 647 The end of active service Memorial in St Laurence Church, Seale Long's final action was in the Siege of Pamplona, after which he was recalled by the Duke of York to England with Wellington's agreement. Long corresponded with Wellington, who assured him that Long's recall was not at his request. Long strongly suspected that the Prince Regent had engineered his recall to vacate the command of his brigade so that Colquhoun Grant (commonly known as \\"The Black Giant\\"), the Prince's favourite, could be made its commander. Grant was also an intimate of the Duke of Cumberland which must have caused Long further displeasure. Long refused the proffered posting as a divisional commander in Scotland and scornfully retired to his estate at Barnes Terrace, Surrey. As an officer on the general list, Long was promoted in retirement; he was promoted to lieutenant general in 1821. Royal recognition was not forthcoming however after his public feuds with two royal princes, and Long was not knighted or offered a title, unlike many of his contemporaries. He died childless in 1825 at his London house in Berkeley Square and was buried in the family crypt at Seale, Surrey. Legacy After his death, his nephew Charles Long, a notable scholar and historian, wrote several pamphlets defending his uncle's reputation and attacking his enemies, especially Beresford; exchanges of pamphlets and letters between Charles Long and his uncle's opponents continued through the 1830s. Robert Long was a conscientious and brave officer, whose reputation suffered as a result of certain character flaws. If his record as a cavalry general was chequered he, nevertheless, contributed substantially to a number of victories, including Los Santos, Usagre and Arroyo dos Molinos. It is to be regretted that he is chiefly remembered for the long-running acrimony generated by the action at Campo Mayor. To his subordinates he appears to have been a popular and respected figure; characteristically he refused to allow Wellington's censure of the 13th Light Dragoons, following Campo Mayor, to be entered in the regiment's official record. From the rank-and-file he gained the affectionate appellation \\"Bobby Long.\\" The officers and men of the 13th Light Dragoons repaid his regard for them when they voluntarily subscribed to the purchase of a set of silver plate for Long when he was replaced in command of his brigade. Unfortunately, Long could not, it seems, avoid entering into vituperative conflicts with his superiors. When the men he made personal enemies of included royal princes (both later to become kings) and a field marshal (albeit in the Portuguese service) Long's career and reputation were bound to be adversely affected. An example of the less attractive side of Long's character is the manner in which he operated a campaign of irritation against Beresford after Campo Mayor. Long harassed Beresford by requesting clarification, to the minutest degree, of virtually every order he was given. Long did not seem to recognise that there were conflicts he had no hope of winning. Beresford was the superior officer with all the advantage of power within the relationship. Long's campaign backfired badly when Beresford, as soon as opportunity allowed, replaced him as the commander of the cavalry. Long was a regular letter writer, particularly to his twin brother Charles. The lively letters he wrote whilst on campaign in the Peninsular War were collected, edited and published in 1951. They provide a valuable insight into the workings of Wellington's army, particularly the cavalry.McGuffie, T.H (Ed).

The natural landscape and the cultural landscape are separate parts of the landscape. However, in the 21st century, landscapes that are totally untouched by human activity no longer exist, so that reference is sometimes now made to degrees of naturalness within a landscape.The European Environment Agency's planned forest naturalness index is an example of an attempt to define one type of natural landscape in Europe. The Agency lists forests in three categories: (1) Plantations; (2) Semi-natural; and (3) Naturally dynamic. The latter are \\"forests whose structure, composition and function have been shaped by natural dynamics without substantial anthropogenic influence over a long period of time\\". In Silent Spring (1962) Rachel Carson describes a roadside verge as it used to look: \\"Along the roads, laurel, viburnum and alder, great ferns and wildflowers delighted the traveler‚Äôs eye through much of the year\\" and then how it looks now following the use of herbicides: \\"The roadsides, once so attractive, were now lined with browned and withered vegetation as though swept by fire\\".Cambridge, Mass.: Riverside Press, 1962, p. 1. Even though the landscape before it is sprayed is biologically degraded, and may well contains alien species, the concept of what might constitute a natural landscape can still be deduced from the context. The phrase \\"natural landscape\\" was first used in connection with landscape painting, and landscape gardening, to contrast a formal style with a more natural one, closer to nature. Alexander von Humboldt (1769 ‚Äì 1859) was to further conceptualize this into the idea of a natural landscape separate from the cultural landscape. Then in 1908 geographer Otto Schl√ºter developed the terms original landscape (Urlandschaft) and its opposite cultural landscape (Kulturlandschaft) in an attempt to give the science of geography a subject matter that was different from the other sciences. An early use of the actual phrase \\"natural landscape\\" by a geographer can be found in Carl O. Sauer's paper \\"The Morphology of Landscape\\" (1925).Carl O. Sauer, \\"The Morphology of Landscape\\". University of California Publications in Geography 2 (2), pp. 19-53. Origins of the term The concept of a natural landscape was first developed in connection with landscape painting, though the actual term itself was first used in relation to landscape gardening. In both cases it was used to contrast a formal style with a more natural one, that is closer to nature. Chunglin Kwa suggests, \\"that a seventeenth-century or early- eighteenth-century person could experience natural scenery ‚Äòjust like on a painting,‚Äô and so, with or without the use of the word itself, designate it as a landscape.\\"Chunglin Kwa, \\"Alexander von Humboldt's invention of the natural landscape\\", The European Legacy, Vol. 10, No. 2, pp. 149-162, 2005 With regard to landscape gardening John Aikin, commented in 1794: \\"Whatever, therefore, there be of novelty in the singular scenery of an artificial garden, it is soon exhausted, whereas the infinite diversity of a natural landscape presents an inexhaustible flore of new forms\\".J. Aikin, M.D., Letters from a Father to His Son, on Various Topics, Relative to Literature and the Conduct of Life. Written in the Years 1792 and 1793, (Philadelphia: Samuel Harrison Smith), p. 148. Writing in 1844 the prominent American landscape gardener Andrew Jackson Downing comments: \\"straight canals, round or oblong pieces of water, and all the regular forms of the geometric mode ... would evidently be in violent opposition to the whole character and expression of natural landscape\\".A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening Adapted to North America. In his extensive travels in South America, Alexander von Humboldt became the first to conceptualize a natural landscape separate from the cultural landscape, though he does not actually use these terms.https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/qnct310.txtChunglin Kwa, Alexander von Humboldt's invention of the natural landscape, The European Legacy, Vol. 10, No. 2, pp. 149-162, 2005 Andrew Jackson Downing was aware of, and sympathetic to, Humboldt's ideas, which therefore influenced American landscape gardening.See Horticulturist, vol.4, no.2, August 1849, which Downing edited. Subsequently, the geographer Otto Schl√ºter, in 1908, argued that by defining geography as a Landschaftskunde (landscape science) would give geography a logical subject matter shared by no other discipline.James, P.E & Martin, G (1981) All Possible Worlds: A History of Geographical Ideas. John Wiley & Sons. New York, p.177.Elkins, T.H (1989) Human and Regional Geography in the German-speaking lands in the first forty years of the Twentieth Century. Entriken, J. Nicholas & Brunn, Stanley D (Eds) Reflections on Richard Hartshorne's The nature of geography. Occasional publications of the Association of the American Geographers, Washington DC., p. 27. He defined two forms of landscape: the Urlandschaft (original landscape) or landscape that existed before major human induced changes and the Kulturlandschaft (cultural landscape) a landscape created by human culture. Schl√ºter argued that the major task of geography was to trace the changes in these two landscapes. The term natural landscape is sometimes used as a synonym for wilderness, but for geographers natural landscape is a scientific term which refers to the biological, geological, climatological and other aspects of a landscape, not the cultural values that are implied by the word wilderness.\\"The Trouble with Wilderness; or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature\\". William Cronon, ed., Uncommon Ground: Rethinking the Human Place in Nature. (New York: W. W. Norton & Co., 1995), pp. 69‚Äì90. The natural and conservation Matters are complicated by the fact that the words nature and natural have more than one meaning. On the one hand there is the main dictionary meaning for nature: \\"The phenomena of the physical world collectively, including plants, animals, the landscape, and other features and products of the earth, as opposed to humans or human creations.\\"\\"Nature\\", New Oxford American Dictionary On the other hand, there is the growing awareness, especially since Charles Darwin, of humanities biological affinity with nature.\\"Animals That Share Human DNA Sequences\\", Seattlepi.com The dualism of the first definition has its roots is an \\"ancient concept\\", because early people viewed \\"nature, or the nonhuman world [‚Ä¶] as a divine Other, godlike in its separation from humans.\\"Gregory H. Aplett and David N. Cole, \\"The Trouble with Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Goals\\" in Beyond Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Stewardshio in an Era of Rapid Change (Washington, DC.: Island Press, 2010), p. 14. They cite William Conron's 1995 essay \\"The Trouble with Wilderness: or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature\\". In the West, Christianity's myth of the fall, that is the expulsion of humankind from the Garden of Eden, where all creation lived in harmony, into an imperfect world, has been the major influence.Joanne Vining, Melinda Merrick and Emily Price, \\"The Distinction between Humans and Nature\\". Human Ecology Review, vol.15, no. 1, 2008, p. 1 Cartesian dualism, from the seventeenth century on, further reinforced this dualistic thinking about nature.Vining, Merrick and Price, p. 1. With this dualism goes value judgement as to the superiority of the natural over the artificial. Modern science, however, is moving towards a holistic view of nature.Maria Kaika, City of Flows: Modernity, Nature, and the City. (New York: Routledge, 2005), p. 4. =America= What is meant by natural, within the American conservation movement, has been changing over the last century and a half. In the mid- nineteenth century American began to realize that the land was becoming more and more domesticated and wildlife was disappearing. This led to the creation of American National Parks and other conservation sites.Gregory H. Aplett and David N. Cole, \\"The Trouble with Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Goals\\" in Beyond Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Stewardshio in an Era of Rapid Change (Washington, DC.: Island Press, 2010), pp. 14-15. Initially it was believed that all that was needed to do was to separate what was seen as natural landscape and \\"avoid disturbances such as logging, grazing, fire and insect outbreaks.\\"Aplett and Cole, p. 15. This, and subsequent environmental policy, until recently, was influenced by ideas of the wilderness.William Cronon, pp. 72-77 However, this policy was not consistently applied, and in Yellowstone Park, to take one example, the existing ecology was altered, firstly by the exclusion of Native Americans and later with the virtual extermination of the wolf population. A century later, in the mid-twentieth century, it began to be believed that the earlier policy of \\"protection from disturbance was inadequate to preserve park values\\", and that is that direct human intervention was necessary to restore the landscape of National Parks to its ‚Äò‚Äônatural‚Äô‚Äô condition. In 1963 the Leopold Report argued that \\"A national park should represent a vignette of primitive America\\".Aplett and Cole, p. 16. This policy change eventually led to the restoration of wolves in Yellowstone Park in the 1990s. However, recent research in various disciplines indicates that a pristine natural or \\"primitive\\" landscape is a myth, and it now realised that people have been changing the natural into a cultural landscape for a long while, and that there are few places untouched in some way from human influence.Aplett and Cole, p. 18 The earlier conservation policies were now seen as cultural interventions. The idea of what is natural and what artificial or cultural, and how to maintain the natural elements in a landscape, has been further complicated by the discovery of global warming and how it is changing natural landscapes.Aplett and Cole, p. 24 Also important is a reaction recently amongst scholars against dualistic thinking about nature and culture. Maria Kaika comments: \\"Nowadays, we are beginning to see nature and culture as intertwined once again ‚Äì not ontologically separated anymore [‚Ä¶].What I used to perceive as a compartmentalized world, consisting of neatly and tightly sealed, autonomous ‚Äòspace envelopes‚Äô (the home, the city, and nature) was, in fact, a messy socio-spatial continuum‚Äù.City of Flows: Modernity, Nature, and the City. (New York: Routledge, 2005), p. 4. And William Cronon argues against the idea of wilderness because it \\"involves a dualistic vision in which the human is entirely outside the natural\\"Cronon, p. 78. and affirms that \\"wildness (as opposed to wilderness) can be found anywhere\\" even \\"in the cracks of a Manhattan sidewalk.\\"Cronon, p. 85. According to Cronon we have to \\"abandon the dualism that sees the tree in the garden as artificial [‚Ä¶] and the tree in the wilderness as natural [‚Ä¶] Both in some ultimate sense are wild.\\" Here he bends somewhat the regular dictionary meaning of wild, to emphasise that nothing natural, even in a garden, is fully under human control. =Europe= The landscape of Europe has considerably altered by people and even in an area, like the Cairngorm Mountains of Scotland, with a low population density, only \\" the high summits of the Cairngorm Mountains, consist entirely of natural elements. These high summits are of course only part of the Cairngorms, and there are no longer wolves, bears, wild boar or lynx in Scotland's wilderness.Murray (1973)Fraser Darling and Boyd (1969) p. 64 The Scots pine in the form of the Caledonian forest also covered much more of the Scottish landscape than today.Steven, H. M. & Carlisle, A. (1959). The Native Pinewoods of Scotland. Oliver and Boyd, Edinburgh The Swiss National Park, however, represent a more natural landscape. It was founded in 1914, and is one of the earliest national parks in Europe. Visitors are not allowed to leave the motor road, or paths through the park, make fire or camp. The only building within the park is Chamanna Cluozza, mountain hut. It is also forbidden to disturb the animals or the plants, or to take home anything found in the park. Dogs are not allowed. Due to these strict rules, the Swiss National Park is the only park in the Alps who has been categorized by the IUCN as a strict nature reserve, which is the highest protection level.Parc Suisse Biosphere Reserve History of natural landscape No place on the Earth is unaffected by people and their culture. People are part of biodiversity, but human activity affects biodiversity, and this alters the natural landscape.National Survey Reveals Biodiversity Crisis American Museum of Natural History Mankind have altered landscape to such an extent that few places on earth remain pristine, but once free of human influences, the landscape can return to a natural or near natural state.YouTube, Professor James Lovelock, We can't save the planet, BBC NEWS, 2010/03/30 Glacier on the border between Alaska, US, and Canada: Kluane-Wrangell-St. Elias-Glacier Bay- Tatshenshini-Alsek park system Even the remote Yukon and Alaskan wilderness, the bi-national Kluane-Wrangell-St. Elias-Glacier Bay-Tatshenshini-Alsek park system comprising Kluane, Wrangell-St Elias, Glacier Bay and Tatshenshini- Alsek parks, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is not free from human influence, because the Kluane National Park lies within the traditional territories of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations and Kluane First Nation who have a long history of living in this region. Through their respective Final Agreements with the Canadian Government, they have made into law their rights to harvest in this region. Examples of cultural forces Cultural forces intentionally or unintentionally, have an influence upon the landscape. Cultural landscapes are places or artifacts created and maintained by people. Examples of cultural intrusions into a landscape are: fences, roads, parking lots, sand pits, buildings, hiking trails, management of plants, including the introduction of invasive species, extraction or removal of plants, management of animals, mining, hunting, natural landscaping, farming and forestry, pollution. Areas that might be confused with a natural landscape include public parks, farms, orchards, artificial lakes and reservoirs, managed forests, golf courses, nature center trails, gardens.

Mercy College caters for 1550 students from kindergarten to Year 12. Mercy College draws on its history as a part of the journey of the Sisters of Mercy, founded by Catherine McAuley. The school was established by the Sisters of Mercy in 1972. The college's aim is to offer a Christian and general education which will provide for the spiritual, intellectual, physical, emotional and social needs of its students. The principal is Julie Hornby. Overview In January 1846 the first Sisters of Mercy arrived in the new colony promising to give their services to the poor, the sick and the uneducated. Within a few years they had built a convent, three schools and two orphanages - one for aboriginal children. In 1888 the sisters established St. Brigid's School in in an area of sand and scrub. By 1896 there were about 500 pupils and in 1928 there were 40 Sisters of Mercy and 600 pupils. As the city and the suburbs grew and spread the sisters from West Perth began new schools at (Aranmore), (St. Brigid's), (St Kieran) and . In 1969 the West Perth Sisters decided to leave West Perth as it was now a busy commercial area, and bought land in Koondoola. Mercy College was built in 1972 for girls in the northern suburbs, and St. Brigid's transferred directly to the new Mercy College as well. The first students were all girls and the first buildings are now part of the Junior Learning Centre on Mirrabooka Avenue. The school expanded rapidly from the first Year 8 - 10 classes in 1972. The primary school (Year 5) began in 1974. Mercy College is now a co-educational school spanning kindergarten to Year 12, and it enrols approximately 1,550 students and employs over 100 staff. The College is separated into three different learning centres: the Junior Learning Centre, catering for students from kindergarten to Year 6; Middle Learning Centre catering for students from Years 7 to 9 and the Senior Learning Centre catering for students from Years 10 to 12.

In total including himself, there were 15 participants representing 15 countries for the one-seater kayak race. Krebs won gold with a time of 46:01.6. The silver medal went to Fritz Landertinger, of Austria, with a time of 46.14.7 and the bronze medal went to Ernst Riedel, of the U.S.A., with a time of 47.23.9. The electric timing apparatus of the firm of L√≤bner was used for time-keeping and there were four timekeepers at the finish line. Prior to and during his canoeing career, he was a competitive cross-country skier and won four German titles with the Bavarian 4x10 km relay at the Nordic Championships from 1928-1932.

A new car was awarded to the writer of the winning slogan. The contest was the brainchild of Alan Pottasch, a PepsiCo advertising executive, and it was won by Appleton, Wisconsin resident, Ellen M. Reimer. Her slogan invited consumers to \\"Come Alive! You're the Pepsi Generation!\\" The original \\"Come Alive\\" jingle was performed by singer Joanie Sommers in her memorable \\"breathy\\" vocal style. Earlier campaigns for Pepsi-Cola had emphasized price competition. Pepsi bottles contained twice as much beverage as standard Coca- Cola bottles, and Coca-Cola was by far the leading brand of soft drink. Pepsi launched a jingle campaign in 1939, \\"Pepsi-Cola Hits the Spot\\": :Pepsi-Cola hits the spot Twelve full ounces, that's a lot! Twice as much for a nickel, too Pepsi-Cola is the drink for you. This 1939 jingle focused on the simple proposition that Pepsi was just as good as Coke, but better value. The Pepsi Generation campaign represented a major shift away from that line of thinking; rather than being just as good as Coke, Pepsi was different from Coke. The Pepsi Generation and its associated jingle -- :You've got a lot to live And Pepsi's got a lot to give. told Pepsi drinkers, now enrolled in the Pepsi Generation, that Pepsi-Cola was taking a stand with the \\"young\\" side of the 1960s-era \\"generation gap\\". Television ads featuring the campaign typically displayed young people pursuing exotic entertainments like motorcycle or watercycle riding or piloting a windship through a desert, while an announcer described Pepsi drinkers as people who saw the \\"young view of things\\". \\"Who is the Pepsi Generation? Livelier, active people with a liking for Pepsi-Cola!\\" Previous Coca-Cola advertisements had featured Norman Rockwell styled images of small towns and nostalgic scenes, as well as traditional figures such as Santa Claus. Pepsi told soft drink consumers that there are Coke people, and there are Pepsi people, and if you're a Pepsi person you are young, and the future's on your side. The original lyrics were: :There's a whole new way of livin' Pepsi helps supply the drive. It's got a lot to give for those who like to live 'Cause Pepsi helps them come alive. It's the Pepsi Generation Comin' at ya, goin' strong... Put yourself behind a Pepsi When you're livin... you belong... You've got a lot to live... and Pepsi's got a lot to give... You've got a lot to live... and Pepsi's got a lot to give... This \\"image campaign\\" inspired Coca-Cola to do a similar \\"hip\\" campaign in 1971, \\"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing (in Perfect Harmony),\\" which also sold the lifestyle rather than the soft drink itself. Pottasch, creator of the campaign, said that \\"For us to name and claim a whole generation after our product was a rather courageous thing that we weren't sure would take off.\\" The \\"Pepsi Generation\\" was one of the first and best known instances of what came to be known as \\"lifestyle marketing\\". It focused on portraying Pepsi drinkers as possessing desirable qualities such as youth, rather than on the characteristics of the product itself. Pottasch said that \\"Pepsi was young, spirited, people doing active things‚Äîplaying volleyball on the beach.... but younger we said in mind, in attitude, in feeling. Young in spirit. Young in heart.\\" Pottasch repeated the themes of the Pepsi Generation with the 1984 campaign, \\"The Choice of a New Generation\\". In 1997, during Super Bowl XXXI, a sequel campaign featured the theme \\"GeneratioNext\\". Many artists have been the voice of the \\"Pepsi Generation\\" commercials including Del Shannon, Michael Jackson & Britney Spears.

His sister, Cornelia, was the first wife of dictator Julius Caesar and he was the maternal uncle of their daughter Julia Caesaris. Cinna was a member of the illustrious gens Cornelia, who were of patrician status. He was suffect consul in 32 BC. Early career In 78 BC, Cinna allied himself with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus in attempting to overthrow the Roman constitution of dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla. Before he left Rome, he sought out the support of Julius Caesar for the rebellion which was not forthcoming. After the defeat and death of Lepidus in Sardinia, Cinna went into exile, accompanying Marcus Perperna Vento to join general Quintus Sertorius in Spain. Caesar was able to recall Cinna from exile back to Rome and used him in the Roman Senate against senatorial opposition. Due to his father‚Äôs association with Marius, under Sulla‚Äôs constitutional reforms he was unable to promote his career. However, when Caesar became dictator, Cinna was soon promoted to the praetorship. Conspiracy against Caesar Although Cinna strongly disapproved of Caesar‚Äôs authoritarian way of governing, he did not become an active participant in the conspiracy that led to his assassination on the Ides of March in 44 BC. The previous day, Cinna had given an inflammatory speech against Caesar, which the people subsequently felt linked him to the plot.Suetonius, \\"The Life of Caesar\\", 85. On the day of Caesar's funeral, a tribune of the plebs, likely Helvius Cinna, was murdered when an enraged mob mistook him for Lucius Cornelius Cinna. At the time of the murder, Cinna was walking in Caesar‚Äôs funeral procession. During the political chaos after these events Cinna did not take advantage of his position to claim a Roman province to govern. Cicero praises him for this act of self-restraint. In 32 BC Cinna served as a suffect consul. Personal life After 47 BC, Cinna married Pompeia Magna, the daughter of the assassinated triumvir Pompey and his third wife Mucia Tertia. This was Cinna's first marriage, and Pompeia's second; her first husband, Faustus Cornelius Sulla, had died in battle. Cinna became a stepfather to Pompeia‚Äôs son from her first marriage. She bore Cinna two children: a son, Gnaeus Cornelius Cinna Magnus, and a daughter, Cornelia Pompeia Magna. Pompeia died before 35 BC.

Biography  Elizabeth Layton was born on 14 June 1917 in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. Her father, a veteran of the First World War suffered from tuberculosis. He was advised because of his health to emigrate to either British Columbia or Australia. The family moved to Canada and settled in Vernon, British Columbia. She attended a London secretarial college in London, before working at an employment bureau. In the summer of 1939, she returned to Canada on holiday. After training in air raid protection, she returned to London, where she obtained work with the Red Cross. It was from here she was sent to Downing Street. In late May 1941 at around 22:30, she first met Winston Churchill. She sat at a silent typewriter where she immediately fell foul of the Prime Minister by making a mistake. He liked his speeches typed in double-spaced lines as he dictated, but she used single spacing. She was ordered from the room as Churchill berated her using the words \\"fool\\", \\"mug\\" and \\"idiot\\". She accompanied Churchill as he travelled abroad in the war years. Layton met President Franklin D. Roosevelt while in Washington D.C. with Churchill at the White House. Another trip saw her as part of the British delegation to the Yalta Conference in the Crimea. Churchill proposed a toast to \\"Miss Layton\\" at a banquet during the conference. She was the only woman present. Her last work in wartime was to take dictation of Churchill's VE-Day speech. She and Churchill wept in his room after his defeat in the 1945 general election. After the loss, Layton told the Churchills of her plans to marry Frans Nel. Frans was a South African soldier who had been released from prison camp following his capture at Tobruk. Churchill and his wife Clementine, upon hearing the news, advised their having four children. Reciting in unison, \\"One for Mother, one for Father, one for Accidents and one for Increase.\\" In 1946, her oldest child was born. In 1958, she released a memoir titled Mr. Churchill's Secretary. Churchill initially objected to the publication, sending a telegram. However, his views softened and he removed his objection when the matter was broached again. After the war, she migrated with her husband to South Africa. In later years, she was invited back to London on several occasions, including in 1990 for the 50th anniversary of Churchill becoming Prime Minister. She also returned in 2005 to join the Queen for the opening of the Churchill museum in the underground Cabinet War Rooms, beneath what is now the Treasury on Horse Guards Road. Family She had two siblings: a brother Michael and sister Alison. Her brother Michael served as a pilot in the Second World War. After the war, she married South African soldier Frans Nel and settled in Port Elizabeth. They had a son and two daughters. Her husband died in 2000. Film depiction She is portrayed in the 2017 British film Darkest Hour by Lily James. In this movie, Nel is portrayed as starting to work as Churchill's secretary already during the Blitz, in 1940. In the film, her brother was said to have died during the retreat to Dunkirk.

Liquidation value is typically lower than fair market value. Unlike cash or securities, certain illiquid assets, like real estate, often require a period of several months in order to obtain their fair market value in a sale, and will generally sell for a significantly lower price if a sale is forced to occur in a shorter time period. Liquidation value may be either the result of a forced liquidation or an orderly liquidation. Either value assumes that the sale is consummated by a seller who is compelled to sell and assumes an exposure period which is less than market normal. The most common definition used by real estate appraisers is as followsDictionary of Real Estate Appraisal, 4th ed., Appraisal Institute, 2002 The most probable price that a specified interest in real property is likely to bring under all of the following conditions: * Consummation of a sale will occur within a severely limited future marketing period specified by the client. * The actual market conditions currently prevailing are those to which the appraised property interest is subject. * The buyer is acting prudently and knowledgeably. * The seller is under extreme compulsion to sell. * The buyer is typically motivated. * The buyer is acting in what he or she considers his or her best interest. * A limited marketing effort and time will be allowed for the completion of a sale. * Payment will be made in cash in U.S. dollars or in terms of financial arrangements comparable thereto. * The price represents the normal consideration for the property sold, unaffected by special or creative financing or sales concessions granted by anyone associated with the sale.

Pieter Jan Herman Fredrik (Wam) Kat (born 23. November 1956, Zeist) is a Dutch political activist and author who now lives in Germany and serves in the city government of Belzig. Biography As child Wam was a longtime member of the Boy Scouts and founded the local branch of the World Wild Life Rangers, the youth organisation of World Wide Fund for Nature. Wam was told by a doctor when he was 18 that he had a year to live and made a conscious choice to live a whole life in a single year; when he did not die, he did not slow down. During his youth and study period he co-founded different organisations and actionsgroups national level for child and youth rights (f.e. Komitee Kindervuist). He was Chairman of the Pacifist Socialist Youth Organisation and Dutch Youth Representative towards the UNESCO in the late 1970s. He was also longtime co-publisher from the first Dutch New Age magazine \\"Waterman\\". Wam was also one of the founders of the Dutch mobile vegetarian kitchen, \\"Rampenplan\\" which supports political activists at extended actions by providing food and other services (since 1981). In 1982 Wam appeared in a Dutch documentary by Hans Fels named: Donkere wolken boven het paradijs: Het offer (Dark clouds over paradise: The sacrifice), telling the story about how he intended to sacrifice himself in protest of the nuclear power plants, by setting himself on fire in the centre of Amsterdam, but got distracted.Donkere wolken boven het paradijs: Het offer Documentary by Hans Fels, 1982 Wam took over the European youth environmental network EYFA (European Youth For(est) Action) from YEE Youth and Environment Europe in 1986 organised to address the effect of acid rain on the regional forests. Wam was instrumental in the rapid growth of the organization and was the principal organizer of the summer festival/university called Ecotopia which was first held in Cologne, Germany in 1989 and moved every subsequent year to a different country. Wam also developed the \\"Eco Rate\\" system which EYFA and other progressive organizations used to equalize access to events and goods by. The Eco rates used a non-market currency conversation system, so that participants from poorer countries would have more favorable rates of exchange than participants from rich countries. Wam is best known for his work during the Yugoslav Wars, co-founder of Za Mir Network (For Peace) and the \\"Zagreb Diaries\\" which he penned at the time, initially as the equivalent of a blog, but ultimately they came out in book form and were translated into several languages. Wam was also co-founder and instrumental in securing funding for the Suncokret Centar (Sunflower) a voluntary humanitary and social organisation during and after the Bosnian war which was with almost 8000 volunteers from all over the world, one of the largest non-governmental efforts to deal with the influx of refugees from the war and was responsible for the free-time activities, schools and social programs in up to 36 refugeecamps in Croatia and Bosnia. In 1993 Kat's work in Croatia and his Zagreb Diary were mentioned, and Kat quoted in an article in The Nation, the oldest continuously published weekly magazine in the United States, about the internet and its future. This July 1993 piece, The Whole World is Talking, was the Nation's first article about the internet.This Is the First Article We Ever Published About the Internet in The Nation by Richard Kreitner, November 19, 2014 Wam later went on to found the Pakrac reconstruction project in the western parts of Slavonia, a region in Croatia. This project used local people from both sides of the regional conflict and international volunteers to rebuild housing which had been destroyed. After leaving Croatia, Wam moved end 1995 to ZEGG intentional community outside of Berlin in Belzig in the Fl√§ming region where he lived and worked for a number of years. In Belzig he started the so-called \\"Info-Cafe Der Winkel\\" (a center for Tolerance and better understanding of different Cultures), which became known as one of Germans best examples of local actions against right-wing violence. Between 1999 and 2001 he shortly moved back to the Balkan, there he was co-founder of Balkan Sunflowers, which still works in Albania, Kosovo and the Republic of Macedonia. In July 2008, he published a political cookbook in Germany, called \\"24 Rezepte zur kulinarischen Weltverbesserung\\" which is roughly translated to \\"24 recipes for culinary world improvement.\\" Wam has been arrested for crimes of conscience in multiple countries. Currently Wam is also serving in the left-wing party Die Linke in the local towncouncil of Belzig. Family Wam Kat is son of Frits Kat, sculptor, and stepson of Pieke Dassen, actor and painter. Kat was married to Ulla Traedmark Jensen and had two children with her, Rik and Pjort, living in Denmark. His older daughter Tyche is from a previous relationship.

It was published by Doubleday and released in hardcover in the United States on January 29, 2008. A paperback edition was released by Delta Publishing on November 18, 2008. Plot Mississippi attorneys Wes and Mary Grace Payton have battled New York City-based Krane Chemical in an effort to seek justice for Jeannette Baker, whose husband and son died from carcinogenic pollutants the company knowingly and negligently allowed to seep into their town's water supply. When the jury awards Baker $3 million in wrongful death damages and $38 million in punitive damages, billionaire stockholder Carl Trudeau vows to do whatever is necessary to overturn their decision and save the company's stocks. Since Mississippi Supreme Court justices are elected rather than appointed, Trudeau plots with Barry Rinehart of Troy-Hogan, a shady Boca Raton firm that deals only in judicial elections, to select a candidate who can defeat the liberal Sheila McCarthy. Their choice is Ron Fisk, a lawyer with no political experience or ambitions. He is naive enough to be impressed by the attention shown him by his backers, and doesn't question his source of funding or his campaign team's underhanded tactics. Rinehart also uses Clete Coley, a clownish third party candidate, to draw support away from McCarthy and then cede it to Fisk when he eventually withdraws from the race. Fisk defeats McCarthy and immediately votes against upholding several large settlements in cases brought before the court on appeal, and the Paytons expect he will do the same when their case comes up for review. What they don't anticipate is Fisk unexpectedly being forced to rethink his stance when his son is seriously injured by a defective product and left permanently impaired by a medical error. The issue of corporate responsibility affects him and his family on a personal level. However, even though Fisk feels that he has been used and tricked, he makes no move to do what is right, and has come to relish his new- found wealth and power. He sides with the big corporation and does not take any action for what happened to his son because he would \\"look silly.\\" Background Grisham has stated that the novel was inspired by the tax evasion and bribery cases involving former Mississippi Supreme Court Judge Oliver E. Diaz Jr.. Mississippi elects judges directly. Grisham appears in the documentary Hot Coffee commenting on Judge Diaz. Grisham's plots closely resembles a real-life decade-long legal battle between West Virginia coal mining competitors. When Don Blankenship, chairman and CEO of A.T. Massey Coal, lost a $50 million verdict in a fraud lawsuit brought by Hugh Caperton and Harman Mining over the cancellation of a long-term coal contract, he contributed $3 million to help Charleston lawyer Brent Benjamin unseat incumbent Judge Warren McGraw. Benjamin won the election, and three years later, when Massey's appeal reached the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, Caperton's lawyers asked him to recuse himself because of Blankenship's financial support. Benjamin declined and cast the crucial vote to reverse the Caperton verdict. Among those who noticed similarities between the case and The Appeal was former West Virginia justice Larry Starcher, who criticized Benjamin for not disqualifying himself. He wrote in an opinion, \\"I believe John Grisham got it right when he said that he simply had to read The Charleston Gazette to get an idea for his next novel.\\" In June 2009, the United States Supreme Court ruled that Justice Benjamin should have recused himself in Caperton v. Massey, sending the case back to the West Virginia Supreme Court. Writing for the majority in the 5 to 4 decision, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy called the appearance of conflict of interest \\"so extreme\\" that the failure to recuse constituted a threat to the plaintiff‚Äôs Constitutional right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. Chief Justice John Roberts' dissent warned that the Court's majority decision would have dire consequences for \\"public confidence in judicial impartiality.\\" Only a minority of states elect judges directly, a controversial system virtually unknown outside the United States. The Appeal has been seen as an attack on this system of selecting judges, since judges have a conflict of interest when ruling on cases involving major campaign contributors.

Its name is sometimes found misspelt as Pecten novaezealandiae. Distribution Pecten novaezelandiae is endemic to New Zealand. It is found in the North Island, South Island, Stewart Island, and the Chatham Islands. Habitat Pecten novaezelandiae is found on sand, silt, and mud from low tide level to over 90 m. Large populations are found at depths of 10 to 25 m. Introduction Pecten novaezelandiae is completely free-living, mobile and somewhat migratory. The two valves are asymmetric. The left valve is convex while the right is flat. The concave valve has approximately 16 ribs. The colour is variable, however the valves are usually a whitish pink, but sometimes can be a dark reddish brown. Natural predators are sea stars and octopus. A colourful young Pecten novaezelandiae Life cycle Sexually mature individuals are hermaphrodites. They are broadcast spawners. The season when the organisms spawn is variable between locations. However, in Tasman Bay, the peak time is from November to March. Fertilisation occurs and a planktonic larva forms. This life stage is conserved for approximately three weeks. Metamorphosis occurs and the larvae changes from planktonic to a benthic existence by attaching itself to suitable substrate on the seafloor. The attachment lasts until the individual is at least five millimetres long. The individual then detaches from the substrate and begins to grow into an adult. Maturity is usually achieved by 18 months. Fisheries The New Zealand scallop is a large industry and export product of New Zealand. The large white adductor muscle is eaten; sometimes, the orange and white gonad is eaten, as well. P. novaezelandiae is considered a fine food and can be expensive to purchase. Recreational and commercial fishing of this species is allowed at particular times of the year, the scallop season. The size and number of scallops which can be caught are under control of the quota management system. In some areas of suitable habitat, such as Tasman Bay, scallop spat is seeded in an attempt to achieve a sustainable fishery.

He was awarded the Goldman Environmental Prize in 1991Goldman Environmental Prize: Samuel LaBudde (Retrieved on November 24, 2007) for his landmark efforts on preserving dolphins and other marine species. He began his career as a biologist by spending six months at sea clandestinely videotaping the practice by tuna fishermen of encircling and killing dolphins. This exposed the largest slaughter of marine mammals in history and sparked a successful consumer boycott, forcing major tuna brands to accept only dolphin-safe fish and prompting the U.S. Congress to enact bans on the encirclement of dolphins by U.S. vessels, and imports of dolphin-deadly tuna. His next and second clandestine project involved a high-seas expedition into the North Pacific with an all-volunteer crew aboard a small wooden sailboat to expose the Asian driftnet fleets, the largest and most destructive fishery in history. This effort resulted in a UN ban on the use of pelagic driftnets. He has also been engaged in exposing the trade in walrus ivory, the illegal trade in tigers, rhinoceros, bears, primates and other species, securing protection for wilderness habitat (including creation of a national park system in Gabon), halting construction of coal-fired power plants and other major polluting industries in the Midwest U.S., and recent successful efforts at the Montreal Protocol to avoid as much as several hundred gigatonnes of CO2e emissions. Career LaBudde earned his B.A. in Biology, Indiana University in 1986 and performed graduate work in evolution and ecology. Since late 2012 he has served as an international climate analyst for the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development (IGSD). His initial focus at IGSD continued efforts begun in association with EIA (see below) to evolve the Montreal Protocol by securing an amendment to enable a global phase-down of hydrofluorocarbons or HFCs. In 2014 LaBudde initiated a parallel effort in concert with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories (LBNL) to significantly increase energy efficiencies within the global cooling sector as a means of doubling or trebling the quantity of avoided CO2e emissions resulting from an HFC phase-down. Since the Montreal Protocol's adoption of an HFC Amendment in November 2016 (Kigali Amendment), LaBudde has continued work to enlarge the effectiveness of the Montreal Protocol in mitigating anthropogenic emissions from halogenated gases and energy consumption in the global cooling sector. From January 2008 to August 2012, LaBudde was the Campaign Director of the Washington, D.C.-based Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA). He was in charge of prosecuting international campaign for oceans, climate and wildlife, and principally efforts to phaseout the manufacture and use of HFCs. During this time he was also responsible for creating the most well funded campaign in EIA's history (on HFCs/Montreal Protocol) and instrumental in challenging the World Bank's ongoing role in distributing hundreds of millions of dollars in payments under the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) to HCFC-22 manufacturers, primarily in China and India. Following the announcement by the EU in March 2012 that they would no longer purchase carbon credits from HCFC-22 manufacturers, and the removal of a major impediment to adoption of an HFC Amendment buy the Montreal Protocol, LaBudde began efforts that he would continue with IGSD to secure accession by India and other developing nations to an HFC Amendment. LaBudde acted as a consultant to ValleyWatch from 2002-2008 where he initiated and organized a campaign blocking construction of the world's largest soybean processing plant by ConAgra Foods. He also assisted in the development and prosecution of regional efforts blocking construction of more than a dozen proposed coal and coal- waste burning power plants in Midwest including a 1500 MW unit by Peabody Coal. During this time, LaBudde also acted as a consultant and wrote numerous white papers and internal documents for executives/ senior management among Fortune 500 companies and others on social, economic and environmental merits of green building & energy efficiency including BP, Siemens, GE, Shell Oil, Microsoft, U.S. Green Building Council, et al. From 1991 to 2004, he was the founder and executive director of the Endangered Species Project and supervised and financed extensive field investigations throughout Asia, Africa and Americas to document illegal trade in bears, tigers, rhinos, primates and other endangered species. Secured international resolutions condemning central involvement of China and Taiwan in the illegal wildlife trade. Conducted investigations and campaign exposing Vietnam as center of SE Asian wholesale wildlife trade. Provided funding, video cameras and other equipment for domestic and international NGO campaigns on wildlife and wilderness protection, and for human rights investigations in Burma, Indonesia and Tibet. Organized and led international campaign to expose Asian tiger trade resulting in domestic legal prohibitions against the trade in China, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan and culminating in implementation of U.S. trade sanctions against Taiwan in 1994 ‚Äî first economic sanctions in history imposed against a country for violations of an international conservation accord. Participated in first Global Tiger Forum in India. Helped establish International Siberian Tiger Sanctuary in Eastern Russia that brought species back from edge of extinction. Researched, co-authored and produced Crime Against Nature, first comprehensive report & video overview on role of organized crime in the illegal wildlife trade. Documented lowland gorilla and other wildlife populations in Gabonese rainforest and wrote and produced comprehensive national ecotourism prospectus for Gabon as part of successful joint effort with WCS and CI to create national park plan comprising 10% of the nation. Testified in several Congressional hearings and worked extensively with Congress, U.S. Interior Department, U.S. National Security Council and other federal agencies, Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, International Whaling Commission, European Community and the NGO community to promote wildlife and wilderness protection. From 1987 to 1992, he was the Staff Biologist/Campaign Director of the Earth Island Institute & Marine Mammal Fund. In 1987 he conducted a six-month undercover investigation exposing the dolphin slaughter by the tuna industry, organized and led domestic campaign resulting in broad industry reforms and reduction of dolphin kills by over 95%. His dolphin video was later seen by a Senate subcommittee and subsequently by packaged tuna manufacturer StarKist, Bumble Bee Foods and Chicken of the Sea. Participated in successful legal and legislative efforts to strengthen and enforce Marine Mammal Protection Act. Member of technical delegation to China to assist in recovery of Baiji or white river dolphin. Helped secure passage of first small cetacean resolutions before International Whaling Commission to protect dolphins and porpoises. Coordinated massive global media campaigns on marine wildlife and fisheries issues. From 1990 to 1993, he was the European Campaign Director of the Humane Society International, where he devised and prosecuted successful efforts to draft/pass EU legislation prohibiting use of driftnets and against use of purse seines on cetaceans by European fishermen. Conducted successful consumer/media campaigns to ban imports of dolphin deadly tuna to remaining EU markets in Italy and Spain. in 1990, as a field investigator for Friends of Animals, he conducted covert investigation in Alaska exposing illegal killing of walrus for ivory trade, polar bears for skin trade. Also documented consequences of Exxon Valdez oil spill on sea otter population. From 1988 to 1990, he was also a field biologist and campaign coordinator of Earthtrust and organized and led first high seas expedition to document use of pelagic driftnets by Asian fishermen.

Early life and education Born in Philadelphia to John Haseltine, a successful businessman, and Elizabeth Shinn Haseltine, an amateur landscape painter, Haseltine studied at the University of Pennsylvania and then at Harvard University, where he received a degree in 1854. Career He first exhibited his paintings the following year at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, after which he sailed to Europe, first joining a colony of American painters who were studying in D√ºsseldorf, then traveling up the Rhine into Switzerland and Italy. In late 1857 he settled in Rome, and in the following months made numerous excursions to draw the landscape around Rome and on Capri. In 1858 Haseltine returned to Philadelphia, and by late 1859 was installed in the Tenth Street Studio Building in New York City, then a central point for American landscape painters; also in the building were Frederic Edwin Church, Albert Bierstadt, and Worthington Whittredge, the latter two having befriended Haseltine in Europe. Though many of his paintings from this time derived from his European sketches, Haseltine also began to paint the oceanside of New England, especially favoring the rockbound coasts of Narragansett, Rhode Island, Nahant, Massachusetts, and Mount Desert Island, Maine. The precision with which he painted these landscapes won critical praise, and Haseltine was elected an Associate of the National Academy of Design in 1860, and a full Academician in 1861. A study of 'The rocks at Nahant' is in Chapter 6 of Rebecca Bedell's 'The Anatomy of Nature'. In 1864 Haseltine's wife died in childbirth. He spent some time training his nephew, Howard Russell Butler, until he married Helen Marshall in 1866 and relocated to Europe. Initially the family considered settling in Paris, but in 1867 they moved to Rome, which would for most of Haseltine's subsequent years serve as his home and point of departure from which to produce views of the European landscape. While his paintings of Capri and Sicily would prove popular with visiting American tourists, Haseltine also traveled and drew in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, summering in Bavaria and the Tyrol in the 1880s and 1890s. In his later years he also returned periodically to the United States, making a final trip to the west in 1899. Haseltine died of pneumonia in Rome in 1900. He is buried at the Protestant cemetery in Rome on Via Caio Cestio, about 5 km from the Episcopal Church of Saint Paul's Within The Walls, of which he was one of the founding members. His son Herbert Chevalier Haseltine became one of the most celebrated sculptors of animals, especially horses. Some of his most famous works were done for clients such as Barbara Hutton and Guy de Rothschild. William's daughter Mildred (Millie), also an artist, married the Roman Prince Ludovico Guardino Carlo Francesco Rospigliosi Pallavicini in Rome in 1904. Above the village of Centrale, hamlet of Zugliano, near Thiene (Vicenza), they built a manor house, named Villa Rospigliosi. After the legal separation Mildred was a benefactor of the country and contributed to the construction of the Cathedral of Thiene with generous donations. There she was also known as Princess Haseltine.

Players can also damage the arcane crystals by destroying all of the opponents units that are on the field. Story In ancient times, before the creation of the worlds, there lived a God. He opened his heart and brought forth a vermilion stone in order to create seven different worlds. Whosoever held the vermilion stone held the power to create worlds, and would reign over the seven worlds as a god, the \\"Lord of Vermilion\\". The seven worlds existed side by side in harmony for millennia, their inhabitants separated by boundaries and unable to interfere with one another... until the \\"Great Collapse\\". The lord of the human world, consumed by ambition, sought to use the forbidden magic of the vermilion stone, called the \\"Arcana\\", in order to become a god. However, he was unable to wield the power and the Arcana was shattered into seven pieces and scattered amongst the seven worlds, destroying their boundaries. The six worlds were drawn into the human world and they merged. With the six races of the six worlds thrust into the human world, chaos and war broke out. Ages later, the world, called the \\"Land of Acheron\\", is still in turmoil. The six \\"Lords\\" of the six races sow strife across the land, warring for each other's Arcana. The player takes the role of a legendary warrior who holds the seventh Arcana and seeks to obtain the Arcana and upset the balance of the world, gathering an army of \\"Familiars\\" who hold faith in the legend of the \\"Lord of Vermilion\\".

The village had a population of 63 around 1940 and has since declined to 0 residents. The town-site is located along Hwy 21 & the historic Red Coat Trail (also known as Hwy 13), about 20 km east of the Alberta-Saskatchewan border and is about 200 km southwest of the city of Swift Current. Demographics Prior to January 1, 1994, Senate was incorporated as a village, and was dissolved into an unincorporated community under the jurisdiction of the Rural municipality of Reno on that date. History Paul Kalmring's family ran a corner store and gas station for most of the time between 1916 and 1983 in the tiny community, named after federal senators of the day when the community was created in 1914. Kalmring's family moved to the area when Paul was two, and his father soon purchased a convenience store and gas station. Senate's population peaked at 63 in the 1940s and was a stopping point for the Canadian Pacific Railway. For a few years, Senate even had its own train ticket agent. The west had just been opened up to waves of European settlers seeking prosperity, and at first, the future appeared promising for Senate and several others along Highway 13, or what is now know today as the Red Coat Trail. During Senate's best years, the community boasted two elevators, a five-room hotel and restaurant, blacksmith shop, lumberyard and Kalmring's general store and gas station. For leisure, the citizens of Senate also built a tennis court and a baseball diamond across the train tracks. But as in most other locales along southwest Saskatchewan, Senate's fortunes declined after the 1940s. Regional farm consolidation, drought and rural depopulation ended all hope for any lasting life at Senate. By the early 1980s, Kalmring sold his store and moved to his farm, three kilometres north of Senate. And in 1983, the community was empty, home only to prairie ghosts. In 1994, with the railway and elevators also gone, rural municipality officials brought in the bulldozers and levelled Senate's remaining dilapidated buildings and dumped part of the debris into a nearby landfill.  Geography  Most cities in Canada and throughout the world have their antipode in the ocean. In the 1940s, Senate was one of only a handful of communities in Canada that has not only land, but a similar size village, in this case Port aux Francais on the Kerguelen Islands, within 10 km of its antipode.
