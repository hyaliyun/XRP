Bennett (June 27, 1938 – January 18, 2013), better known as Bobby Bennett, was an American singer, songwriter, choreographer, comedian,and musician, noted for being a member of the vocal group The Famous Flames from 1958 to 1968. During his time in the group, he served as a singer, songwriter, instrumentalist, comedian, emcee and dancer in the James Brown Revue. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of The Famous Flames in 2012. Biography=Early life and career Bobby Bennett was born Robert J. Bennett on June 27, 1938 in Burlington, North Carolina. The son of Robert and Inez Bennett, he was raised in Burlington's Rauhut Street in Alamance County, where it was called \\"Glencoe Road\\", and graduated from Jordan Sellars High School in 1957. According to his wife, Sandra, Bennett sang with the gospel group, the Harmonizing Five and traveled with them locally and to many East Coast and southern states from Maryland, DC and Virginia all the way to Florida. Following graduation, Bennett received a four-year sports scholarship to attend A&T; University in Greensboro. During his time in college, Bennett majored in Agricultural Studies. In the spring of 1958, Bennett left college for a summer break, finding work in New Jersey to earn funds for the following school year. Following this, he visited New York to see his old friend, J. C. Davis whose band, The Bucket-Heads, was playing for James Brown and The Famous Flames at the Rocklin Place in New York City as Davis had become Brown's first bandleader. Bennett and Davis were school buddies who did shows together while attending high school. Bennett eventually became Davis' valet. The Famous Flames While attending the performance, Bennett found out from Davis that one of the Famous Flames, Robert Gram, was leaving the show to get married and wasn't going to return. Davis insisted that Bennett should try out for the position because Davis felt that Bennett had the voice and talent. Auditions started at the Teresa Hotel in New York City. Bennett beat out twenty other hopefuls to get the position and became a full-fledged member of the Famous Flames in 1958, causing Bennett to permanently drop out of college. During the time Bennett joined, James Brown had not yet established himself as a dominant force in music and was himself considered still just a member of the Famous Flames. Brown's manager, Ben Bart, had caused a rift in the original lineup of the group after suggesting the group perform under the \\"James Brown and The Famous Flames\\" billing following the success of their first hit, \\"Please, Please, Please\\". When Bennett joined, the Famous Flames consisted of Brown, \\"Baby Lloyd\\" Stallworth and Johnny Terry. Contrary to popular belief, The Famous Flames were not backup musicians.They were a singing group. Founder Bobby Byrd, who had left in May 1957, wasn't a member at the time Bennett joined. Byrd's departure caused Brown to take control of the group, with the help of Ben Bart. Byrd would occasionally show up to mentor the act. Under Brown's insistence, Byrd rejoined the group as a member just before they were set to open for Little Willie John at their first appearance at The Apollo Theater on April 24, 1959. One of Bennett's first recordings as a Famous Flames member was with the song, \\"Good, Good Lovin'\\", which became a regional hit. Between 1960 and 1964, Bennett would participate in several hit recordings with the Flames including \\"Think\\", \\"Bewildered\\", \\"I Don't Mind\\", \\"Shout and Shimmy\\", \\"I'll Go Crazy\\", \\"Oh Baby Don't You Weep\\", \\"This Old Heart\\" and others. Despite the frequently incorrect crediting of James Brown as the sole artist on these songs, they were recorded and made hits by the entire group, \\"James Brown and The Famous Flames\\". Bennett, along with the other Famous Flames, also wrote or co-wrote several songs with the group. By the early 1960s, the Famous Flames had established themselves as the top-ranked R&B; group of the time, both on record and on tour. Following their success, it was suggested that the group record a live album. The group's explosive, high energy live performances across America rarely failed in bringing audiences to states of frenzy. Their tight harmonies and explosive dance routines increased their popularity as they performed in venues such as The Regal Theater in Chicago, The Royal Theatre in Baltimore, the Cleveland Arena in Cleveland, the Howard Theatre in Washington, D.C. and the Apollo in New York City. Despite King Records president Syd Nathan's protests that live albums didn't sell, Brown financed his own money to release the Live at the Apollo album in 1963, which eventually reached # 2 on the Billboard Pop Album Chart, and sold over a million copies,a feat unprecedented for a R&B; album at that time. Like most of the material featuring the Famous Flames, they weren't credited with Brown on this album,(but they were included in the album's intro by Fats Gonder), though later reissues in the CD era would credit the group alongside Brown later on. The group started experiencing mainstream success following the Apollo album and by 1965 had appeared in TV shows such as The Ed Sullivan Show, the Dick Clark-hosted shows, American Bandstand and Where the Action Is and other shows, both nationally and regionally. The group also began touring globally, performing in venues such as The Olympia in Paris, Royal Albert Hall in London and also appeared on the UK music show, Ready Steady Go! The group's popularity had become so massive that Bennett later said they couldn't leave their hotels to go sightseeing because \\"we were getting mobbed by people.\\" The group also appeared in two Hollywood motion pictures, The T.A.M.I. Show, which was a 1964 concert film, taped at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium on October 28 and 29, 1964 in which the group upstaged headliners The Rolling Stones; and 1965's Ski Party, a Frankie Avalon vehicle in which James Brown and The Flames were humorously cast as the \\"white bread\\" resort's all-black ski patrol. Both features were filmed by American International Pictures . Bennett contributed along with James and the other Flames on more hit live albums including the Billboard Top 10 Pop hit album Pure Dynamite! Live at the Royal, where Bennett was responsible for the group's comedic stage routines, and James Brown and the Famous Flames Live at the Garden, though the actual show was at Cherry Hill's Latin Casino. Bennett also contributed to studio albums such as Think! and Showtime. The group's last studio recording with Brown was \\"Maybe the Last Time\\", released as the b-side to Brown's rock'n'roll hit, \\"Out of Sight\\" in 1964. In addition to recording for King Records, Bennett (and fellow Famous Flame \\"Baby Lloyd\\" Stallworth) also recorded several solo James Brown-produced singles for other labels, including the now defunct Loma Records, a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Records, where he recorded \\"Soul Jerk Pts. 1 & 2\\", under the billing, Bobby Bennett & The Dynamics. As the group's fortunes increased, however, James Brown began to think in terms of solo success, apart from the Flames, helping to bring dissension within the group, which Bennett confirmed in an interview with the Cleveland Plain Dealer in 2012. Bennett noted the change, stating, \\"in the beginning, we all rode around in a station wagon, with each of us taking turns doing the driving.\\" As the success grew, their mode of transportation changed. While some of the members had moved up to bus, Brown rode around in either by a Cadillac or a Learjet; Bennett noted this as being \\"the beginning of the separation of James Brown and the Famous Flames\\". The group's label, King Records, was of no help as they only posted Brown's image on the covers of their albums instead of the entire group, and also failed to sometimes mention the group's name in covers they did appear in, including the Pure Dynamite and Showtime albums. Brown had also taken control of the group's finances, allegedly taking the lion's share of profits from live performances and studio recordings for himself, while the rest of the group was put under a salary. When the other Flames balked at this process, Brown responded by using them less on his records, later stating that they \\"couldn't sing well\\". The Famous Flames continued to back Brown until further arguments over monies and royalties and the stress of being on the road led to Lloyd Stallworth walking out first in 1966 . Bennett also eventually left the James Brown Show in 1968. With their name on several releases between 1965 and 1968, but no Flames singing on record, much of the public, who had never seen the group perform live, mistakenly believed that the Famous Flames were Brown's band, instead of the vocal group they actually were.. The last single in which the Famous Flames received label credit was \\"Licking Stick\\" (King 6166) in 1968. Only Byrd participated in the recording with Brown, beginning a period in which the duo sung duets on several hits including \\"Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine\\", \\"Soul Power\\", \\"Make It Funky\\", \\"Talkin' Loud and Sayin' Nothing\\" and \\"Get Up, Get into It, Get Involved\\". Byrd didn't receive label credit on these songs. Because of this and other reasons, mainly financial disputes, Famous Flames founder, Bobby Byrd too, finally left for good in 1973. Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction in 2012 On April 14, 2012, Bobby Bennett was inducted retroactively with the rest of The Famous Flames, into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. When the group's lead singer, James Brown, was inducted into the Hall of Fame's inaugural class in 1986, the other members of his group, Famous Flames members Bennett, Bobby Byrd, Johnny Terry, and Lloyd Stallworth, were not inducted. This caused a 26-year controversy, and puzzled many of the group's fans. Finally, in 2012, The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame formed a special committee to discuss certain deserving pioneering groups that were not inducted with their lead singers in the Hall of Fame's initial years of inductions . As a result of this committee's decision, The Famous Flames, including Bennett, were one of the six groups automatically inducted into the Hall of Fame, without the need for nomination and voting, under the premise that they should have been inducted with James Brown back in 1986. Bennett, the sole surviving member of the Famous Flames at age 74, accepted on behalf of the group. In an interview with the Rock Hall on the eve of The Flames' induction, Bobby said: \\"James (Brown) was a Flame. Bobby Byrd was a Flame. Lloyd Stallworth was a Flame, and Bobby Bennett (who's still here), was a Famous Flame also.\\" \\"We performed all over the world. \\"We were the best out there: best dancers, best singers, we were good\\". Everyone else opened for us: The O'Jays, Four Tops, Temptations, Smokey Robinson & The Miracles, Gladys Knight and The Pips, Patti La Belle (and The Bluebelles). Everybody has worked with James Brown and The Famous Flames. We were the stars of every show that was out there\\". The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame awarded Bobby Bennett, and the other members of The Famous Flames, Bobby Byrd, Lloyd Stallworth, and Johnny Terry, posthumously on April 14, 2012. In a 2012 interview with Goldmine, the famous Oldies music magazine, Bobby Bennett, the last surviving member of the Famous Flames, when asked how he'd like the group to be remembered, said: \\"I want (people) to know one thing,” replied Bennett. “We were the Famous Flames… James Brown was a Famous Flame, Bobby Byrd was a Famous Flame, Lloyd Stallworth was a Famous Flame and Bobby Bennett was a Famous Flame…wherever we played, we were the Famous Flames. We were never the band, never. We were the 3 guys who danced (and sang) with him and the 3 guys who performed with him at every concert. We were not no 'band'. We were the group that worked hard on stage and did a wonderful performance on stage for the whole public.\\" Bobby's statement about The Famous Flames being a singing group and not \\"backup musicians\\" was also confirmed by Flames lead singer James Brown in a 1982 interview on The David Letterman Show. Bennett died at his home in Maryland on January 18, 2013, of complications of diabetes, less than one year after the group's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction. Ten days later, on January 28, 2013, The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame website issued an article paying tribute to him. He is survived by his wife of many years, Sandi, and their children. Actor/choreographer Aakomon Jones played Famous Flame Bobby Bennett in the James Brown biofilm \\"Get on Up\\", which opened in U.S.theatres on January 8, 2014. He also served as choreographer for the film. In 2020, Bobby Bennett was posthumously inducted with the rest of The Famous Flames' members Baby Lloyd Stallworth,Bobby Byrd, and Johnny Terry into the National Rhythm and Blues Hall of Fame, some seven years after the induction of Flames lead singer James Brown into the same organization. https://www.facebook.com/201846143194483/photos/a.201874793191618/3364359496943116/?type=3&theater; ReferencesExternal links The Official Facebook Page of The Famous Flames-by Bobby Bennett's widow Sandi Bennett * Washington Post interview with Famous Flame Bobby Bennett * The Cleveland Plain Dealer article: The Famous Flames: James Brown was their leader, but they were R&B; legends, too (Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Class of 2012) By John Petkovic Friday, April 06, 2012 * \\"Keep On Doin'What You're Doin\\" Bobby Byrd, James Brown, and The Famous Flames * The Famous Flames' Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame Induction Site * The Famous Flames on the Future Rock Hall website * Famous Flame Gets His Chance to Shine-from The Burlington Times-News-by Molly McGowan * The Famous Flames- James Brown's Original Singing Group 1953-1968- blog from Charles Crossley's \\"Top of The Charts\\" Yuku website Goldmine Magazine interview with Bobby Bennett, the last surviving member of 2012 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame-inducted vocal group, The Famous Flames- by Bill Gordon James Brown vocalists The Famous Flames members 1938 births 2013 deaths People from Burlington, North Carolina King Records artists Loma Records artists African-American male dancers African-American dancers American male dancers American rhythm and blues singer-songwriters American soul singers American male singers Deaths from diabetes Singers from North Carolina ","title":"Bobby Bennett (The Famous Flames)"},{"id":"36049930","text":"William Walsh (1859-after 1913), Irish piper.

He maintained correspondence with Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler and Giovanni Faber, a pontifical botanist. He is one of the first four observers of Transit of Mercury that happened on 7 November 1631. 385x385px  Biography = Early Life in Thuringia  Johann Ruderauf was born on 22 September 1588 in Herda, near Bad Salzungen in Thuringia (Germany). His father Jeremias Ruderauf (or Rudravius) was a pastor and a schoolmaster. In the Julian Calendar, Johann was baptised as a Protestant on 15 September 1588.Thüringer Pfarrerbuch: Grossherzogtum Sachsen (-Weimar-Eisenach) - Landesteil Eisenach 866, p. 363. He enrolled at the University of Jena in 1605.Herda - Geschichte von Herda und seinen Menschen. In 1607, he observed the passage of a comet, and then wrote a booklet of some fifty pages titled Gründliche Beschreibung des neuen monstrosischen Sternes, welcher anno Christi 1607 …am hohen Himmel geleichtet, (Accurate description of the new monstrous star that shone in the sky from July 27 to mid-October in 1607), where he proposed an astrological interpretation of this \\"sign of God\\". This was actually Halley's comet that did not yet bear the current name. In 1608, he went to Italy. Probably he had never returned to his native country thereafter.  Remus Quietanus in Italy  Johann Ruderauf registered at the University of Padua in 1608 where he studied medicine. There he was also acquainted with Galileo.1619 Remus Quietanus writes to Galileo \\"te ante decennium Patavii cognovi\\". (See Letter online) In Italy, he took up the Latinized name Johannes Remus Quietanus and converted to Catholicism. In 1609, he made a southbound trip to Sicily and Malta. In 1611, he was in Rome where he sent the first letter to Kepler. In the next years, he studied in the Collegio Romano with professor Christoph Grienberger\\"Christophorus Grienbergerus (…) praeceptor meus venerandus…\\", Remus Quietanus, Restitutio universalis Motuum coelestium..., Rome 1615, page 29.. Remus Quietanus was well received by the pontifical circle, he befriended a number of cardinals and Giovanni Faber, secretary of the Accademia dei Lincei. He made astronomical observations, especially solar and lunar eclipses, and wrote two pamphlets on this subject.  Doctor of Habsburg  In 1618, Remus Quietanus went to the court of Archduke Maximilian III of Austria in Innsbruck. There he met Christoph Scheiner. After the death of Maximilian in Vienna on 2 November 1618, Remus Quietanus was appointed the Imperial Doctor, serving Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor, and also his cousin Leopold V, the new Archduke of Austria-Tyrol. In 1619, he met Johannes Kepler in Linz.  Witness of the Thirty Years' War  In his correspondence with Giovanni FaberArchives of Accademia dei Lincei, letters from Remus Quietanus to Giovanni Faber.(1618-1622), Remus Quietanus reported the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War, and military events favorable to Habsburg in Bohemia. But soon after Mansfeld moved the theater of conflict to Alsace. Leopold V, who was also the bishop of Strasbourg, was obliged to go there to defend his possessions. Remus Quietanus joined his entourage. In 1619, Remus Quietanus met Maria Schlitzweck, a young Alsatian lady he would soon marry.  Doctor in Rouffach  He settled in Rouffach around 1620. His wife gave birth to a boy in 1623.The municipal archive of Rouffach, register of birth, marriage and death. Remus Quietanus was named the physician (doctor) of the city. Maria Schlitzweck died on 27 February 1635. Quietanus married again in 1650 to Maria Helena Freudenstehlin, who came from Ensisheim. Remus Quietanus died in Rouffach on 17 October 1654.  Correspondence with Kepler and Galileo  When Remus Quietanus wrote to Kepler in Rome in 1611, the two men did not know each other yet. Quietanus commented on recent astronomical news, yet expressed some reservations on Copernicus' heliocentric system. Kepler answered him point by point in March 1612. This correspondence resumed in 1618 when Quietanus was the doctor of the princes of Habsbourg. Kepler looked forward to a future collaboration, but their partnership was limited to an exchange of 15 letters until 1620. The contact was reestablished from 1628 to 1630, the year when Kepler died. In 1619, Remus Quietanus exchanged three letters with Galileo. Quietanus sent to Galileo his description of the 1618 comet and a copy of Kepler's Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae, which was not circulated in Florence as it was put on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum by the Roman Catholic Church. Because of his position, Quietanus played an intermediary role between the two principal actors of the Copernican Revolution whose relations had already deteriorated.See Kepler et Galilée, une rencontre manquée? Hervé Delime  The Transit of Mercury in 1631  In his Rudolphine Tables published in 1627, Kepler predicted the transit of inferior planets at the end of 1631: 7 November for Mercury and 9 December for Venus. Until then, no one had been able to observe such phenomena. He reiterated his announcement in 1629 by publishing a reminder (Admonitio ad astronomos). Informed by this prediction, Johannes Remus Quietanus observed the transit of Mercury in Rouffach on 7 November 1631 from 9 h 42. He wrote a short report, addressed to the archduke Leopold V.An extract of this letter is included in the 1666 edition of Tycho Brahe's Historia Coelestis, pages 955 and 956 [read online]. This transit of Mercury was also observed by Pierre Gassendi in Paris, by Johann Baptist Cysat in Innsbruck and by an anonymous person in Ingolstadt.Astronomie par M. de Lalande, 1776, Paris, page 578.Pierre Humbet, A propos du passage de Mercure 1631, in revue d'histoire des sciences, année 1950 3-1, [read online].  Publications = Calendars and Diaries  Starting from 1624, Remus Quietanus published regularly (probably every year) calendars containing the ephemerides of planets and weather forecasts. The first known edition is “Neuer Schreibkalender, auff das Jubel Jahr 1625(…)“, Basel 1624, (New Calendar for the Year of Grace 1625(…) Containing the Real Course of the Sun and the Moon, the Sunrise and Sunset, the Lunar Phase and the Planetary Configurations, the Solar and Lunar Eclipses and the Probable Weather Conditions). It is presented in the form of a diary. Extant copies or references of the Schreibkalender can be found for the years of 1624, 1625, 1626, 1627, 1629, 1630, 1631, 1638, 1641, 1650.

Posterity  Apart from the first observation of the Mercury transit, relatively little is known of Remus Quietanus, a privileged witness of the Copernican revolution. But he is not a passive observer. In his correspondence with Kepler, he took part in astronomical debate and asked questions that fitted exactly with the issues of his time: the calculation of longitudes, the nature of comets, the dimension of planets, their distances to the sun and especially the distance from the Earth to the Sun (Astronomical unit). On the last point, he had a better intuition than Kepler who gave an estimation of 3400 of Earth radius. Remus Quietanus proposed 14000.Kepler Gesammelte Werke, Caspar, volume18, letter 1101 from Kepler to Wallenstein, page 384. Not until 1685 did Christiaan Huygens suggest a more accurate estimation (around 23500 of Earth radius).

Plot A nudist site in eastern Germany is sold to Dieter Lohe, a conservative textile manufacturer from Bavaria. He visits his new property with his daughter Natalie, and plans to use the property as a hunting ground. For fear of losing their tenancy agreement, the members of the association adjust to Lohe's presence by walking around dressed. Jakob Steiner, the son of the club's leader, doesn't accept the nudist family tradition and because of this argues with his father. Jacob becomes close friends with Lohe's daughter. Lohe eventually gets wise to the clothed nudists, and after a few complications all of the parties involved come to an arrangement.

The broad-shelled river turtle is one of the oldest maturing and longest living species of freshwater turtles in existence and occurs in wide sympatry with Emydura macquarii and Chelodina longicollis. C. expansa is listed as ‘vulnerable’ in South Australia and ‘threatened’ in Victoria.  Distribution and habitat  Broad-shelled river turtles are found throughout the Murray-Darling River system of South- Eastern Australia. A number of distinctive populations have been located across central and coastal Queensland areas. C. expansa is mostly found in turbid waters at depths of which are greater than three metres. The turtle generally inhabits permanent streams and may occur in rivers, oxbows, ponds in floodplains, backwater, and swamps across its distributed region, however is mostly a river turtle. The broad-shelled river turtle will tend to inhabit environments that are undisturbed and have moderate vegetation cover for nest construction. The turtle has shown a preference of aquatic habitats in structured environments, where submerged logs, root systems and dead trees occur. Factors such as shelter from predators, and food availability may influence the habitat preference of e. Expansa. Seasonal changes including the water levels and flow may also influence the selected the habitat.  Description  The broad-shelled river turtle has a broad, oval and flattened shell with a length of around 50 cm. The carapace length is often longer in females than males. The turtle has a rich brown to blackish-brown above, typically displaying fine dark flecks or reticulations. The turtle has a whitish or creamy coloured underneath. The plastron is narrow and the shell does not display any noticeable expansion anteriorly. The shell is usually twice as long as wide and is broadest at the level of the bridge. The head is broad and highly depressed and the eyes are directly dorsolateral. When extended, the neck may surpass the measurement of the carapace.  Behaviour  The broad-shelled river turtle is mostly active from the Australian spring season (October) through to early autumn (April). The species tends to decrease in movement and feeding over the cooler winter months. C. expansa is described to also show head bobbing and self-grooming actions. Chelodina expansa spends most of its time in water. During periods when water levels are low, C. expansa will traverse over land to find other water sources. The turtle may also bury itself into mud and enter extended periods of aestivation until rain occurs and water levels increase.  Reproduction  C. expansa usually nests during the Australian autumn or in early winter when soils decrease in temperature. It will also sometimes nest during spring. Although the female broad-shelled river turtle will travel up to one kilometre away from the bank to lay her eggs, it is more common for them to nest within 100 m of the waters edge. Along the Murray River nests are often constructed at the top of sandy ridges. In Autumn nestings, the nest temperatures will initially decrease and then remain low during the winter period before slowly increasing during spring to reach a maximum temperature during summer. The female turtle constructs a nest by excavating a nesting chamber with her back legs to a depth of around 20 cm. She then deposits between 5 and 28 eggs before backfilling the nest with soil. The broad-shelled river turtle has shown a ‘body-slamming’ type behaviour when compacting nests. This behaviour results in the formation of a hardened 'plug' which helps to seal the nest. These turtles will nest any time of the day or night with nesting being initiated by rain. Turtles tend to select sites that have higher sun coverage to construct their nests. The selection of nest sites is often a long way from the waters edge and this is seen as a behavioural strategy to minimise the risk of nest flooding. Hatchlings are however exposed to a number of challenges during their travels to the water. and the incubation period is exceptionally long due to inherently slow embryonic development, averaging between 324 and 360 days. The development of the embryo also slows the process as it enters a two distinct diapause stages. The primary diapause stage occurs inside the female, the secondary diapause is triggered through a drop in temperature and occurs after the egg is laid and once a small period of growth has occurred. The young will generally hatch during Spring, Asynchronous hatching is most likely maladaptive in the natural environment Upon hatching from the egg the young remain entombed underground in the nesting chamber, waiting for heavy rain to trigger their release by digging their way out through the hardened soil.  Diet  The broad-shelled river turtle is highly specialised and entirely carnivorous. C. expansa primarily preys upon frogs, crustaceans, aquatic insects, and small fish.  Predators  The introduced red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and ravens (Corvus spp.) are the major threat to the nests of the broad-shelled river turtle. Predation of nests by feral foxes along the Murray River is in excess of 93% which means there is little recruitment of young turtles into an ageing population. As turtles are long lived animals, and adults are still commonly seen in the wild, this can lead people to falsely believe that the population is still healthy. Other nest predators include monitor lizards, ibis and feral pigs. Predation on nests is the main challenge for C. expansa, however it is thought that the turtle becomes aware of predators, mostly from olfactory and visual signs. Once the turtles have hatched and dug their way from the nest chamber they face a variety of predators while they travel overland to water; these can include birds and lizards in addition to feral foxes and cats. Many young turtles also die from dehydration if they fail to reach the water in time, and some are killed whilst trying to cross roads. Once they reach the water they are subject to more predators such as fish. In the disjunct Queensland populations, the main predator of hatchlings is the spotted barramundi.  Threats  The broad- shelled river turtle is infected with parasitic adult worms (D. pearsoni and D. megapharynx). The worms appear to be host specific and live in the intestines of C. expansa.

It was written by Víctor Carrasco, Larissa Contreras, María José Galleguillos and Alexis Moreno. Directed by Vicente Sabatini. Set in the desolate interior of the Atacama Desert in 1934 it classifies both as a historical romance and a working-class melodrama dealing with tyranny, classism and misogyny as principal motives, but given the wide array of characters there are substories centering in themes such as innocence, religious hypocrisy, unrequited love, narcissism, betrayal and prostitution. Plot In the Atacama Desert, lies the saltpeter (Nitrate) mine Pampa illusion, that after years of economic boom, faces an uncertain future due to global crisis. The owner of this office is Mr. William Clark (Héctor Noguera), a despot, bedridden, English-born businessman who refuses to accept the end of his economic prosperity. The daily life and routine in the saltpeter mine is interrupted by the arrival of his daughter Inés (Claudia di Girolamo), a doctor, banished from the family along with her mother when she was a newborn. She will come to discover the reasons for the exile and humiliation suffered by her mother thirty years before, risking her life when her father orders apprehension of any unknown women who enters the office. to avoid detection she takes a double life: by day disguised as a man called \\"Dr. Florencio Aguirre\\" Mr. Clarck's GP and eventual confidant; and by night re-takes her true personality as Inés Clark. Under the shadow of William, lives Manuel (Francisco Melo), his son (and unknowingly, younger brother of Inés), a weak and insecure man that spends his days trying to please and win the approval of his mentally abusive father and hide from him the near bankruptcy of the business. Then there is Jose Miguel Inostroza (Francisco Reyes), Clark's right arm, an exemplary employee who follows Mr. Clark's orders blindly, even if the orders are harmful and abusive to the workers of Pampa Ilusion. His obedience is affected by the arrival of Inés, for whom he falls in love, Forcing him to choose between his loyalty and his principles. Both as \\"Dr. Aguirre\\" and herself, Inés gets involved in the daily lives of the workers and administratives of the mine in the midst of the revolution against her father's oppressive rule, and slowly wins over the loyalty and friendship of the inhabitants both poor and wealthy. Among these are Clara Montes (Blanca Lewin), A wealthy socialité and feminist and Inés's primary confidant, and Alberto Quispe (Juan Falcón), Clara's secret lover and a peruvian miner fighting discrimination against his own.

Written and recorded following a six-month hiatus from band activities, the album was produced by bassist and multi-instrumentalist Chris Taylor. Preceded by the singles, \\"Sleeping Ute\\" and \\"Yet Again\\", an expanded version of Shields, entitled Shields Expanded, was released on November 12, 2013, featuring additional tracks recorded during the sessions, demo recordings and remixes. The eight additional tracks were issued as a separate mini-album, entitled Shields: B-Sides. Shields has been described as the band's most collaborative album, with vocalist and guitarist Daniel Rossen noting, \\"[The band's aim was to] write and make music that is as collaborative as possible, so that we have a product that we all feel a sense of authorship over as a collective.\\" The album received acclaim upon release. Shields reached number seven on the Billboard 200 and number seventeen on the UK Albums Chart. Background After extensive touring in support of the band's third studio album, Veckatimest (2009), Grizzly Bear undertook a six- month hiatus from band-related activities. Vocalist Ed Droste noted, \\"There was such a level of exhaustion that I really needed to pretend I wasn't in the band for a little bit. I needed to be back in my life with my friends and my spouse, and live a day-to-day existence that had nothing to do with music. That was really good for everybody.\\" Vocalist and guitarist Daniel Rossen stated, \\"Those were strange times. [...] I felt a little bit shell-shocked by the touring experience of Veckatimest and part of me was just wondering if there was some other version of a life that I could have that wasn't as heavily involved in the music industry.\\" During the break, bass guitarist and producer Chris Taylor released a solo album, Dreams Come True (2011), under the pseudonym CANT, stating, \\"I can't just take a break. For whatever reason, I'm the kind of person who needs to constantly to work on stuff. When we finished touring, I didn't want to take some time off, I just wanted to go into the studio. But, I really didn't want to book myself in with a band and go record them, so I decided I'd try and make my own record.\\" Daniel Rossen recorded and released a solo EP, Silent Hour/Golden Mile (2012), featuring tracks initially intended for Shields. Recording Regarding the band's eventual return, Ed Droste noted, \\"Coming back together to try to write and record was like being in junior high again – after you go away for the summer, the first couple of weeks are slightly awkward when you get back to school. Then, you get back into the swing.\\" Daniel Rossen elaborated, \\"The whole process with this record felt like starting over. We took enough time off that we... I don't know. My head kind of went out of the game or something. Getting back into it was really confusing. It took a long time.\\" Marfa, Texas, where the band began its initial recording sessions. In June 2011, the band moved to Marfa, Texas to begin recording their fourth studio album, with bassist and multi-instrumentalist Chris Taylor returning to his role as producer. Droste noted, \\"We had passed through before and there is a great arts collective and vibe. We decided to rent a place and make our next album there.\\" The band recorded \\"an album's worth of material\\" in Marfa, but ultimately abandoned the majority of tracks.Iqbal, Nosheen. Interview: Grizzly Bear's Ed Droste and Chris Bear. Time Out. Retrieved September 12, 2012. Vocalist Ed Droste noted, \\"We were like, 'We're ready to do this!' Then, we got there and recorded twelve songs and were like, 'This isn't quite there.'\\" Vocalist and guitarist Daniel Rossen elaborated, \\"We didn't have that unspoken momentum, that unspoken understanding of what everyone is into.\\" Only two songs from these sessions made it onto the finished album; \\"Sleeping Ute\\" and \\"Yet Again\\". Cape Cod and Cape Cod Bay, where the band recorded the majority of the album's material. The band subsequently started afresh in early 2012, returning to Droste's mother's home in Cape Cod, where the band had previously recorded its second studio album, Yellow House (2006).Pareles, Jon. Plugging Into a New Synergy. New York Times. September 13, 2012. Retrieved September 13, 2012. Commenting on the return to Yellow House, Droste noted, \\"It's so funny that we went back there in the end. It's my grandmother's house, we know it, and we can use it for free. And as soon as we got there, things started happening. [...] We just sat by the fire, Dan strumming, me singing, and it happened. Some of the best songs on the record, like \\"Speak in Rounds\\" and \\"Half Gate\\", came out of that. We stayed there in isolation for two months straight.\\" Droste stated that he and Rossen decided to \\"'try writing from the bottom up. We've never done it before.' There's a little bit of fear there because it's a new process we've never tried. We've never sat side by side and said, 'Let's literally, out of the ether, start writing songs together.' A couple of songs came that way, and that's why they're verse me, chorus Dan. [...] Suddenly the synergy hit, and the momentum struck, and then everyone got excited. And that's when the ball started to roll, and then we just started playing around, and people were much more open.\\"\\" Ed Droste described Shields' overall aesthetic as \\"very in-your-face\\", saying that \\"the drums and vocals are clearer and louder. It's not as dreamy and pastoral and sleepy as past efforts, and there's a lot of raw vocal takes, which is something we don't normally do.\\" Rossen elaborated, \\"Previous records were definitely dreamier with lots of layered vocals and we've started paring those back and taking them away, taking them away. That's what we went for on this record: clearer performances and more direct arrangements.\\" Talking about Chris Taylor's production, Rossen stated, \\"Part of his strength is that he pushes us. [...] He enables us to try stranger stuff; he pushes us to that side of ourselves. [...] He's always thinking of the whole palette, I feel, whereas Ed and I might be more worried about a melody or a lyric.\\" The album was mixed by Michael Brauer.Colletti, Justin. Behind The Release: Grizzly Bear Shields. September 13, 2012. Retrieved September 13, 2012. Writing and composition The songwriting process for Shields was more collaborative than on past releases, with vocalist Ed Droste noting, \\"As we get older, more confident, and more mature, we're becoming more comfortable with stepping on each other's toes.\\" Pairs of band members did writing retreats with each other, with band members regularly building off of other members' ideas. Lyrically, Ed Droste described Shields as Grizzly Bear's \\"most verbose album\\" yet, noting, \\"It's funny, because I think back to a song like \\"Colorado\\", where I was basically singing ten words over and over again for five minutes straight – and that's it. There's nothing on this album like that. There's a lot more there, verbally, and it's definitely emotionally charged.\\" Bassist and producer, Chris Taylor stated, \\"For this record, it was really important to us to try and make sure that lyrics had a weight to them and at least some sense of a narrative, even if it was loose. There were lyrics in previous albums that seemed to have no meaning whatsoever. And that always really annoyed me. We agreed it'd be really important and awesome if we could just try and make all the lyrics tell something. [...] I was definitely able to use lyrics as a frame to how I would let the arrangements build and then fall away.\\" Regarding the album's thematic content, Daniel Rossen noted, \\"There's a lot of talk about negotiating distance from people in your life. We were dealing with that in various forms, learning what it means to be alone, learning what it means to be close to somebody, certain things coming to a head. It just feels like a major difficulty in life.\\" Droste elaborated, \\"There's a desire to be autonomous, but there's also this great fear of being alone, and there's this constant feeling of, 'How do you reconcile this?' There's this need for space, but there's also this, 'Come closer come closer.'\\" Artwork and release The album's artwork features paintings throughout by American artist Richard Diebenkorn, with its front cover featuring his 1981 print, Blue Club. Each Diebenkorn piece included features either a spade or club symbol, traditionally found on playing cards.Shields liner notes.

Critical reception Shields received widespread critical acclaim upon its release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 86, based on 36 reviews, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Pitchforks Lindsay Zoladz gave the album a Best New Music designation, writing \\"While there's no question that Grizzly Bear's last two records have sounded gorgeous, critics of the band have wondered if that's enough. Shields, the band's fourth and most compositionally adventurous record, should put those concerns to bed. Though full of baroque, detail-rich production and latticework melodies, Shields also offers an emotionally resonant core.\\" In another positive review, AllMusic's Heather Phares wrote: \\"While it's not as obviously big a statement as Veckatimest was, Shields is plenty ambitious in its own right, and its complexity demands and rewards patient listening.\\" The A.V. Clubs Chris DeVille praised the contributions of Chris Taylor and Christopher Bear, stating, \\"On an album that touches repeatedly on the barriers people build between each other, the members of Grizzly Bear have forged further ahead into sweet synchronicity. Sam Cleeve of Drowned in Sound called Shields \\"[..] [A] warm-blooded record, beholden to analogue gear and flawless mastering — one destined to fit snugly on a turntable rather than to live as ones and zeros on your iPod\\", while PopMatters Robert Alford called it \\"an album that unveils deeper levels of emotional impact and aesthetic dimension for a band that continues to challenge and captivate in ways that are entirely their own.\\" Kevin Liedel of Slant Magazine, on the other hand, gave the album a mixed review, writing \\"But while the band admirably seeks to avoid mimicking Veckatimest's themes, it neither expands on those motifs nor presents anything interesting in their place. Pretty but formless, Shields plays like a calculated retreat into something altogether indistinct and inconsequential.\\" Pitchfork ranked Shields at number 10 on its list of the top 50 albums of 2012, writing: \\"Shields is a magnificent record, where the lights are blazing, but nobody's feeling very much at home.\\" The album was also listed at number 35 on Rolling Stones list of the top 50 albums of 2012, saying \\" Ed Droste and Daniel Rossen have grown into one of indie rock's most sophisticated songwriting teams, melding idiosyncratic approaches to texture and tune into a subtly mind-blowing whole.\\" The album was listed at number 16 on Stereogum's list of top 50 albums of 2012.

In 1991, Berean Bible College moved its campus to Living Way Church in Poway, California. Currently the President of Berean Bible College is Rev. Douglas Balcombe, Senior Pastor Emeritus of Living Way Church. The Dean of the College is Rev. Bobby San-Miguel. In Fall 2012, Berean Bible College's first satellite campus opened in Maui; on-site classes at this campus were subsequently discontinued. Today Berean Bible College offers both on-site education at its Poway campus and distance learning. Classes offered may vary each quarter. Berean Bible College is a small, close-knit community bible college. Classes are held Monday and Tuesday evenings, with a chapel service on Tuesdays. Distance learning courses are accessible at any time to those enrolled in the class. Academics Classes are offered on Monday and Tuesday nights. There are also correspondence elective classes which a full- time student may need to take in order to be classified as full-time. Upon successful completion of the prescribed classes and elective units required to graduate, students are awarded an associate's degree (2nd year student), a certificate of theology (3rd year students), or a bachelor's of theology degree (4th year students). There are four major courses of study offered at Berean Bible College,Programs of Study including a ministerial program designed to prepare individuals for full-time service as a pastor or an evangelist. Training includes preparation in such basic functions of the ministry as homiletics, exegesis, evangelism, pastoral counseling, church administration and conducting various types of worship services and meetings. The missionary degree aims to prepare the individual for full-time service in the mission field. It is similar to the Ministerial course except that it is intended to prepare students for service in missions, both at home and abroad. Special emphasis is placed on practical training on how to establish indigenous churches. The Christian Education degree seeks to prepare the individual for full-time service in the Christian Education program of a local church as an educational director and other related areas. Lastly, the Biblical Counseling degree trains people to view problems in life from God's perspective and will be encouraged to develop a methodology for change in harmony with the Scriptures.

It was named by Alexander Wilhelm Armin Kellner in 1996. In 2003, Kellner defined the clade as a node-based taxon consisting of the last common ancestor of Anhanguera, Pteranodon and all its descendants. The clade Ornithocheiroidea is sometimes considered to be the senior synonym of Pteranodontoidea, however it depends on its definition.Unwin, D. M., (2003): On the phylogeny and evolutionary history of pterosaurs. pp. 139-190. -- in Buffetaut, E. & Mazin, J.-M., (eds.): Evolution and Palaeobiology of Pterosaurs. Geological Society of London, Special Publications 217, London, 1-347 Brian Andres (2008, 2010, 2014) in his analyses, converts Ornithocheiroidea using the definition of Kellner (2003) to avoid this synonymy. A preview that shows the cladogram without clade names Despite the meaning of the group's name, not all pteranodontoids were toothless, the earlier genera such as the istiodactylids and ornithocheirids had teeth that they used to catch prey, and several conclusions had led to the idea that they later evolved into the toothless pteranodontids. Pteranodontoids were also the most diverse group of pterosaurs throughout the Cretaceous period, and therefore the most successful flyers during their time. They were mostly replaced by the larger azhdarchids at the end of the Late Cretaceous however, which resulted in resource and terrain competitions, but even so, pteranodontoids still managed to thrive with them, and genera such as Alcione, Barbaridactylus, Simurghia and Tethydraco lived until the Cretaceous- Paleogene extinction event (commonly known as \\"the extinction of the dinosaurs\\"), around 66 million years ago. Pteranodontoids had similar a similar diet to modern-day soaring birds such the albatross, which mainly consisted of fish. Some genera of this group however, fed mainly on carrion, this can be seen on the earlier genera such as Istiodactylus. They were also known for their proportionally large wingspans, though as mentioned earlier, not as large as those of the azhdarchids, which reached about , while the largest wingspan recorded of any pteranodontoid only reached . History of research=Earliest finds Lectotype rostrum of Pterodactylus giganteus, the first ever known pteranodontoid Several fossil remains were found in the Chalk Formation of England, a chalk pit known for its wide variety of fossils belonging to different animals. British paleontologist James Scott Bowerbank named and described the specimens found as a new species of Pterodactylus, P. giganteus due to its much larger size. The assigning of new pterosaur species to Pterodactylus was very common at the time, since Pterodactylus was the best known pterosaur back then. In 1851, Bowerbank unearthed more specimens in the same chalk pit as P. giganteus, and assigned these specimens to yet another newly named species of Pterodactylus, known as P. cuvieri, in honor of the German naturalist and zoologist Georges Cuvier. Later that year, British paleontologist Sir Richard Owen had also unearthed several fossil specimens in the Chalk Formation, in which he assigned them as Pterodactylus compressirostris during its description.Owen, R. (1851). Monograph on the fossil Reptilia of the Cretaceous Formations. The Palaeontographical Society 5(11):1-118. Owen later unearthed many fossil specimens from a different fossil site called the Cambridge Greensand, he then assigned these specimens into a new species called Pterodactylus simus. With the naming of this new species, British paleontologist Harry Govier Seeley created a new separate genus called Ornithocheirus (from Ancient Greek \\"ὄρνις\\", meaning \\"bird\\", and \\"χεῖρ\\", meaning \\"hand\\"), due to the notion of the time, in which pterosaurs were the direct ancestors of birds. In 1869, Seeley then reassigned Pterodactylus cuvieri into a new species called Ptenodactylus cuvieri, but in 1870, Seeley had realized that the generic name Ptenodactylus had been preoccupied, and therefore he reassigned the species into Ornithocheirus cuvieri. Between these two years, Seeley had also reassigned various species of pterosaurs, including the mentioned P. cuvieri into newly named species of Ornithocheirus, therefore 27 in total. He then published a book called The Ornithosauria (meaning \\"bird lizard\\"), in reference to the relationship of birds and pterosaurs.Seeley, H.G., 1869, Index to the fossil remains of Aves, Ornithosauria, and Reptilia, from the Secondary System of Strata, arranged in the Woodwardian Museum of the University of Cambridge.

Cambridge, 130 pp. Naming of early discovered genera Specimen YPM1177, the type specimen of Pteranodon, now interpreted as a female individual due to its short cranial crest The naming of the different pterosaur species, as well as the genus Ornithocheirus in England resulted in further research in other places. In the United States, American paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh led an expedition to the Smoky Hill Chalk deposits in western Kansas in 1870.Betts, C. W. 1871. The Yale College Expedition of 1870. Harper’s New Monthly Magazine, 43(257):663–671 Marsh unearthed the first ever specimens of pterosaur from North America (specimens YPM 1160 and YPM 1161), which now belong to the genus Pteranodon, and consisted of partial wing remains and a tooth of the fish Xiphactinus, which Marsh had once believed that it belonged to Pteranodon.Marsh, O. C. 1871. Scientific expedition to the Rocky Mountains. American Journal of Science, ser. 3, 1(6):142–143. In 1871, he assigned these specimens to a new species called \\"Pterodactylus oweni\\" (meaning \\"Owen's wing finger\\"),Marsh, O. C., 1871. \\"Note on a new and gigantic species of Pterodactyle.\\" American Journal of Science, ser. 3, 1(6):472 in honor of Sir Richard Owen, but he realized that the name he had chosen had already been used for a different European pterosaur species described by Harry Seeley, so he renamed his discovery as Pterodactylus occidentalis (meaning \\"Western wing finger\\"), in reference to the location were it was found, he then used this name for its publication in 1872. In the same year, Marsh named two additional species, which were based on size differences: Pterodactylus ingens (the largest specimen found), and Pterodactylus velox (the smallest).Marsh, O. C. 1872. Discovery of additional remains of Pterosauria, with descriptions of two new species. American Journal of Science, Series 3, 3(16):241–248. Marsh's bitter rival, American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope had also unearthed several remains of the large North American pterosaur, and based on these remains, Cope named two new species, Ornithochirus umbrosus and Ornithochirus harpyia, in an attempt to assign them to the large European genus Ornithocheirus, but he had missed the 'e' when describing them. The paper naming these species by Cope's paper naming had been published in 1872, just five days after the publication of Marsh's paper. This led to a dispute between the two paleontologists, which both fought over whose names had priority to the published literature, in what was obviously the same species of pterosaur. Meanwhile, in England, controversies between the naming of species and genera also started, with the paleontologists Harry Seeley and Richard Owen fighting over reassignings of different species as well as genera. In 1874, Owen was not pleased with Seeley's publication of his book The Ornithosauria, and he also considered the name Ornithocheirus inappropriate.Owen, R. 1874, Monograph on the fossil Reptilia of the Mesozoic Formations. Palaeontographical Society, London, 14 pp Owen therefore created two new genera: Coloborhynchus (meaning \\"maimed beak\\") and Criorhynchus (meaning \\"ram beak\\"), in reference to their unique convex \\"keeled\\" crests on top, and underside of their snout. Owen then created a type species for Coloborhynchus, C. clavirostris, and sunk three species which were assigned from Ornithocheirus, and Criorhynchus consisted entirely of 5 former Ornithocheirus species, including the type species, O. simus, which was later reassigned by Owen as Criorhynchus simus. In 1881 however, Seeley disagreed with Owen's conclusion, and he therefore assigned the species he named Ornithocheirus simus as the type species of Ornithocheirus. He had also named a new separate species called O. bunzeli in the same year. In 1875, Cope conceded that Marsh's names, (P. occidentalis, P. ingens and P. velox) did have priority over his, but stated that the species he named Ornithochirus umbrosus, which was formerly assigned as Pterodactylus umbrosus by Cope himself, was a distinct species, but not genus, from the ones that Marsh had previously name. Later scientists have re-evaluated and supported Marsh's case, and also found that Cope's assertion of O. umbrosus as a larger and distinct species was most likely incorrect.Cope, E.D. (1875). \\"The Vertebrata of the Cretaceous formations of the West.\\" Report, U. S. Geological Survey of the Territories (Hayden), 2: 302 pp., 57 pls. In 1876, Marsh had described the first skull specimen of Pteranodon, which as unearthed by American paleontologist Samuel Wendell Williston in the Smoky Hill River, located in the Wallace County (now Logan County) of Kansas, USA. Later that year, another skull specimen was found, though this time a bit smaller in size. Soon enough, Marsh recognized a major difference when he described these specimens, they lacked teeth and had bony crests on their skulls. He then described the specimens found as \\"distinguished from all previously known genera of the order Pterosauria by the entire absence of teeth.\\" Marsh then coined the name Pteranodon (meaning \\"wing without tooth\\"), and pointed that the unique characteristics identified warranted a new generic name. Marsh had also reclassified all the previously named North American species from Pterodactylus to Pteranodon, and considered the smaller skull to belong to the reassigned Pteranodon occidentalis based on its size.Bennett, S.C. (2000). \\"Inferring stratigraphic position of fossil vertebrates from the Niobrara Chalk of western Kansas.\\" Current Research in Earth Sciences: Kansas Geological Survey Bulletin, 244(Part 1): 26 pp. He also assigned the larger skull (specimen YPM 1177) to a new species which he named Pteranodon longiceps, and he later thought that this was a medium-sized species, in comparison to the larger P. ingens. Specimens of smaller individuals were later uncovered, and Marsh had also named several additional species: Pteranodon comptus and Pteranodon nanus, based on these distinct and smaller fragmentary skeletons. He then created another separate species called Pteranodon gracilis, which is now based on a wing bone that he previously mistook for a pelvic bone. Marsh soon realized his mistake, and therefore reassigned that specimen he found into a separate genus which he named Nyctosaurus, and the species P. nanus was soon recognized as a Nyctosaurus specimen as well, this is due to the synapomorphies seen in both. Witton, M. (2010). Pteranodon and beyond: The history of giant pterosaurs from 1870 onwards. Geological Society of London Special Publications. 343. 313-323. Holotype specimen (NHMUK R176) of Ornithodesmus latidens, which consisted of a neck vertebra and sternal elements A peculiar discovery was made in 1887 by Seeley in the Isle of Wight, an island off the coast of southern England. Seeley thought that these fossil remains belonged to bird-like creature, which he then named Ornithodesmus cluniculus. Later that year, British fossil collector John Whitaker Hulke suggested that Ornithodesmus was a pterosaur, therefore he found it to be similar to fossils that he had already seen before, but Seeley disagreed with him. Seeley reported another specimen found on the same site, after his first discovery of the animal, it was then acquired in the British Museum in 1882. The specimen had been assigned to Ornithocheirus nobilis by Richard Lydekker in 1888, but Seeley considered it another species of Ornithodesmus, which he now considered a species of pterosaur instead of a bird. Seeley named the new species as O. latidens in 1901, the specific name translates to \\"wide tooth\\". He pressumably assigned this new species to Ornithodesmus due to synapomorphies between their sacra, but his conclusion was not entirely clear. The type specimen, NHMUK R176, is a poorly preserved skeleton consisting of the back of the skull, a neck vertebra, a sternum, a sacrum, both right and left humeri, a notarium, part of the radius and ulna, carpals, metacarpals, as well as wing phalanx bones. Holotype specimen (UALVP 24238) of Pteranodon sternbergi American paleontologist George Fryer Sternberg uncovered several fossil remains from the lower Niobrara Formation beds in 1958, these specimens looked similar to those of P. longiceps, though the crests were set upright, and in a different position. Later, in 1966, American paleontologist John Christian Harksen assigned the specimens found as a new species called Pteranodon sternbergi, due to its distinct upright crest, yet similar to that of P. longiceps. This complicated the situation of Pteranodon species assigning however, which prompted another revision of the genus by Halsey W. Miller in 1971. Miller concluded that all Pteranodon species except P. longiceps and P. sternbergi (the ones based on skulls) must be considered nomina dubia and abandoned because the crest shape for all of the species based on headless skeletons were impossible to determine. The conclusion of Miller however, was mostly ignored at the time, and many paleontologists kept assigning previously found specimens to new species. Jeffrey Eaton had once thought that a skull he found belonged to P. ingens, but was later placed in a new species called P. marshi, and the skull he previously assigned to P. occidentalis was reassigned as P. eatoni, resulting in two new species. Contrary to his first conclusion, Miller had recognized another species based on a skull with a crest similar to that of P. sternbergi, he then assigned its specimen as a new species called P. walkeri.Bennett, S.C. (1994). \\"The Pterosaurs of the Niobrara Chalk\\". The Earth Scientist. 11 (1): 22–25. Revising species Holotype of Ornithocheirus simus (A to D), and holotype of the junior synonym O. platyrhinus (E to H) The disputed controversy of Ornithocheirus was reviewed by British paleontologist Edwin Tulley Newton in 1888, in which he reassigned 13 existing species into Ornithocheirus, interestingly, he also reassigned Cope's Ornithochirus umbrosus and Ornithochirus harpyia into Ornithocheirus, now with the correct spelling (which includes the 'e' that Cope missed).Newton, E. T., 1888, \\"On the Skull, Brain, and Auditory Organ of a new species of Pterosaurian (Scaphognathus purdoni), from the Upper Lias near Whitby, Yorkshire\\", Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, v. 179, p. 503-537 Meanwhile, in the US, Samuel Williston examined the classification of Pteranodon by Marsh in 1892, and he noticed that back in 1871, a mention by Seeley about a partial set of toothless pterosaur jaws from the Cambridge Greensand of England had taken place, which he then named his discovery as \\"Ornithostoma\\". Williston also noted that the primary characteristic Marsh had used to separate Pteranodon from other pterosaurs was its lack of teeth, and because \\"Ornithostoma\\" was toothless, this made Williston conclude that \\"Ornithostoma\\" must be considered the senior synonym of Pteranodon.Williston, S.W., 1892, \\"Kansas pterodactyls, Part II\\", Kansas University Quarterly, 2: 97-81 German paleontologist Felix Plieninger in 1901 however, pointed out that \\"Ornithostoma\\" had never been scientifically described or even assigned to a species name until Williston's conclusion, and therefore had been considered a nomen nudum, which in this case could not beat out Pteranodon for naming priority.Plieninger F., 1901. Beiträge zur kenntnis der Flugsaurier. Palaeontolographica, 53, 209-213. Williston accepted his conclusion, and went back to calling the genus Pteranodon, but both Williston and Plieninger however, were incorrect, because unnoticed by both of them was the fact that in 1891, Seeley himself had finally described and properly named Ornithostoma, assigning it to a new species called O. sedgwicki.Seeley, H.G., 1891, \\"On the shoulder girdle in Cretaceous Ornithosauria\\", Annals and Magazine of Natural History Series 6 7: 237-255 Much later in the 2010s, more research on the identity of Ornithostoma had shown that it was not Pteranodon or even a close relative, but may in fact have been an azhdarchoid pterosaur similar to Quetzalcoatlus, which are also toothless pterosaurs. Later in 1892, Williston had become the first scientist to critically evaluate all of the Pteranodon species classified by Cope and Marsh. He agreed with most of Marsh's reassignings and classifications, but several exceptions were still made. He did not believe that P. ingens and O. umbrosus could be considered synonyms, which even Cope had come to believe, and he also considered both P. velox and P. longiceps to be dubious. Williston's reason was that P. velox was mainly based on non-diagnostic fragments, and P. longiceps was probably a synonym of one of the other previously named species. Williston revised his earlier conclusion in 1903, in which he stated that there were only three species of Pteranodon, instead of seven. He also considered both P. comptus and P. nanus to be specimens of Nyctosaurus, and divided the other species into small (P. velox), medium (P. occidentalis), and large species (P. ingens), based primarily on the shape of their upper arm bones. He also followed his first conclusion of P. longiceps being a synonym of either P. velox or P. occidentalis based on its size.Williston, S. W. 1903. On the osteology of Nyctosaurus (Nyctodactylus), with notes on American pterosaurs. Field Mus. Publ. (Geological Ser.) 2(3):125–163, 2 figs., pls. XL-XLIV. Later that year, paleontologist Jeffrey G. Eaton became the first scientist to publish a more detailed description of the entire skeleton of Pteranodon. He used most of his findings to revise its classification, once again based on a better understanding of the differences in pteranodontian anatomy. Experiments using clay models of bones was conducted by Eaton to help determine the effects of crushing and flattening of the shapes of the arm bones that Williston had used in his own classifications. Eaton concluded that most of the differences in bone shapes could be easily explained by the pressures of fossilization, and concluded that none of the skeletons of Pteranodon had any significant differences from each other besides their size. Therefore, Eaton was left to decide his classification scheme only based on skull differences, in which he assigned them to three different species according to their size. He only recognized three valid species in the end of his description: P. occidentalis, P. ingens, and P. longiceps.Eaton, G. F. 1903. The characters of Pteranodon. American Journal of Science, ser. 4, 16(91):82–86, pl. 6-7.Eaton, G. F., 1904. The characters of Pteranodon (second paper). American Journal of Science, ser. 4, 17(100):318–320, pl. 19-20. Skull elements of the specimens NHMUK R3877 and R176, and the 1913 long-jawed skull reconstruction by Reginald Hooley In 1913, the British amateur paleontologist Reginald Walter Hooley described two more specimens found that belonged to O. latidens, which were collected in 1904 from the sea after a rockfall near Atherfield Point on the Isle of Wight. Specimen NHMUK R3877 was the first to be collected, and consisted of a skull, neck and trunk vertebrae, a shoulder blade, an ischium, and parts of the forelimbs. Specimen NHMUK R3878, was the second to be collected, and includes parts of the pectoral girdle as well as forelimbs. These specimens found represent the most complete remains of Cretaceous pterosaurs in England, more complete than even Ornithocheirus, and specimen NHMUK R3877 was one of the only known three-dimensionally preserved pterosaur skeletons during the 20th century. Hooley also reviewed O. latidens in detail, and placed the genus Ornithodesmus in its own family, Ornithodesmidae. Williston from the US, subsequently reviewed Hooley's article, disagreeing with some of his conclusions about the anatomy and classification of the animal. After the monograph of Hooley about Ornithodesmus, little was written about the animal for the rest of the century, and similar pterosaurs were nowhere to be found for decades. Later in 1993, the British paleontologists Stafford C. Howse and Andrew C. Milner concluded that the holotype sacrum and only specimen of the species O. cluniculus didn't belong to a pterosaur, but instead to a maniraptoran theropod dinosaur. They pointed out that no detailed attempts had been made to compare the sacrum of O. cluniculus with those of pterosaurs, and that the species O. latidens had in effect been treated as the type species of the genus Ornithodesmus in their conclusion. Now as a definite species of pterosaur, \\"O.\\" latidens thus required a new generic name. In 2001, Howse, Milner, and David Martill, reassigned \\"O.\\" latidens to a new genus called Istiodactylus, resulting in a new combination known as I. latidens. The generic name Istiodactylus means \\"sail finger\\", in reference to its proportionally large wings. Howse, Milner, and David Martill had also named a new family called Istiodactylidae after moving \\"O.\\" latidens into Istiodactylus, with Istiodactylus as the only member of the family. In 1914, Hooley had made a brief review of the pterosaur Ornithocheirus, he kept its generic name, but created two new genera: Lonchodectes (meaning \\"lance biter\\"), and Amblydectes (meaning \\"blunt biter\\"), in reference to the shape of their snouts.Unwin, D.M. (2006). The Pterosaurs: From Deep Time. Pi Press:New York, p. 251. . Many paleontologists weren't aware of this reassigning however, and therefore it wasn't used much at the time. The species Pterodactylus compressirostris, uncovered by Owen back in 1851, was formerly transferred to Ornithocheirus in 1870 by Seeley, but it became the type species of Lonchodectes in Hooley's review. This species however, was confusingly regarded, incorrectly, as the type species of Ornithocheirus. Hooley reassigned the species O. crassidens as the type species of Amblydectes, but fossil remains are scarce, so little of the animal is known.Hooley, R.W. (1914). On the Ornithosaurian genus Ornithocheirus with a review of the specimens from the Cambridge Greensand in the Sedgwick Museum, Cambridge. Annals and Magazine of Natural History, series 8, 78: 529-557. Classification Originally defined by Alexander Kellner in 1996, Pteranodontoidea is sometimes considered a synonym of the clade Ornithocheiroidea according to several studies. The name Ornithocheiroidea was originally defined as an apomorphy-based taxon by Christopher Bennett in 1994. In 2003 however, Kellner redefined Ornithocheiroidea to represent the node of Anhanguera, Pteranodon, Quetzalcoatlus and Dsungaripterus, thus making Ornithocheiroidea a more inclusive group.Kellner, A. W. A., (2003): Pterosaur phylogeny and comments on the evolutionary history of the group. pp. 105-137. -- in Buffetaut, E. & Mazin, J.-M., (eds.): Evolution and Palaeobiology of Pterosaurs. Geological Society of London, Special Publications 217, London, 1-347 Later that year, David Unwin suggested a different definition, the node that contains Pteranodon longiceps and Istiodactylus latidens, as a resulting, he considered Pteranodontoidea a junior synonym of Ornithocheiroidea. Brian Andres (2008, 2010, 2014) in his analyses, converts Ornithocheiroidea using the definition of Kellner (2003) to avoid this synonymy. Andres & Myers (2013) presented a phylogenetic analysis that placed Pteranodontoidea within the group Pteranodontia, as the sister taxon of the family Nyctosauridae. In 2018 however, Longrich, Martill, and Andres revisited the classification, and concluded that Pteranodontoidea would be the more inclusive group containing both Ornithocheiromorpha and Pteranodontia. Topology 1: Andres & Myers (2013). Topology 2: Longrich, Martill, and Andres (2018).Longrich, N.R., Martill, D.M., and Andres, B. (2018). Late Maastrichtian pterosaurs from North Africa and mass extinction of Pterosauria at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. PLoS Biology, 16(3): e2001663. Paleobiology=Locomotion Pteranodontoids, like other pterosaurs, are considered to have been skilled fliers as well as adept at moving on the ground. Evidence from footprints shows that most pterosaurs did not sprawl their limbs to a large degree, as in modern reptiles, but rather held the limbs relatively erect when walking, like dinosaurs. While no pteranodontoid footprints are known, it is likely that they also walked erect. Among pterosaurs, pteranodontoids had unusually uneven limb proportions, with the forelimbs much longer than the hind limbs. This would likely have required them to use unique modes of locomotion when on the ground compared to other pterosaurs. It is possible that pteranodontoids ran (but not walked) bipedally, or that they used a hopping gait. Pterosaur researcher Mike Habib has noted that the limbs proportions of pteranodontoids like Anhanguera are consistent with hopping.Habib, M.

Gameplay The game offers sixteen mini-games, consisting of twelve single-player titles (two of which can be played with two players) and four multiplayer-only titles for up to five players. The game exclusively uses the Wii U GamePad with no need for additional Wii U Pro Controllers. During the game, players can earn tokens which can be used in a 'Cluck-a-Pop' capsule machine to unlock additional toys and minigames. Single player titles ;Arrow :Arrow is a single player game in which players control Wario in which he must defend a crop of strawberries from oncoming robots. The GamePad is used as a bow used to launch arrows at opponents. Hitting explosive objects allows players to take out multiple enemies at once. Players can also use limited pepper shakers to fire an explosive shot. If the robots reach the front of the screen, they will launch an attack on the GamePad screen, requiring the player to tap them to stop them stealing their strawberries. ;Shutter :Shutter (Camera in PAL regions) is a photography game hosted by Mona that tasks players with using the GamePad as a camera to take photos of specific individuals amongst a crowd of characters. The TV displays the entire event and the player holds the GamePad upright parallel to the TV to see a zoomed-in portion of the event on the GamePad screen and capture photos of the correct characters. Players earn more points based on how quick they capture photos of all of the desired characters and the quality of the photos. ;Ski :Ski is a single player game in which players control Jimmy T. as he skis down a slope. The game is played with the GamePad held vertically, tilting the controller to steer Jimmy. The television screen shows an action camera of Jimmy's progress. The game has five levels that are single slopes, with the goal of reaching the bottom as quickly as possible, and an endless mode, in which the player has to ski for as long as possible without falling off the slope. ;Patchwork : Patchwork is a game hosted by Kat and Ana in which players use the GamePad's touchscreen to place patchwork puzzle pieces in the correct spots to solve each puzzle. ;Kung Fu :Kung Fu is a platform game hosted by Young Cricket & Master Mantis.

Players can see upcoming platforms and obstacles on the TV screen and guide where Young Cricket lands from looking at the GamePad screen. ;Gamer :Gamer is a single player game in which players control 9-Volt as he decides to play video games in bed. On the GamePad, players are tasked with WarioWare style microgames, featuring simple objectives that must be completed quickly. However, the player must also pay attention to the television screen and be prepared to hide the video game to avoid being caught by 9-Volt's mother 5-Volt. To prevent the player from hiding his video game too often, 9-Volt also has a meter that decreases his awakeness as he hides. The game ends if 9-Volt is caught by 5-Volt, runs out of lives in his game, or ends up falling asleep by hiding for too long. Players can also play the WarioWare minigames on their own by choosing 18-Volt. A stage based on this game is featured in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. This mini game is also a feature in WarioWare Gold for the Nintendo 3DS. ;Design :Design is a game hosted by Dr.Crygor for 1 or 2 players. Using the stylus, players must draw specific shapes on the GamePad screen according to Crygor's instructions, such as drawing lines of a certain length, circles of a specific diameter, etc. At the end of the game, the sketches are realized to be components of a robot and attach to the face of a newly-constructed robot depending on how close the sketches came to the instructions. Higher scores correspond to better built robots, while lower scores correspond to broken down robots. ;Ashley :Ashley is a game hosted by Ashley, in which players tilt the GamePad and use the shoulder buttons to guide Ashley on her broom through a dessert world. Ashley travels to the right and players tilt the GamePad to change her position up and down on the screen to obtain as many collectibles as possible in each level. ;Taxi :Taxi is a game hosted by Dribble & Spitz. Using the GamePad, the player must ferry around passengers whilst fighting off UFOs that are trying to snatch them. ;Pirate : Pirate is a rhythm game hosted by Captain Wario.

The players hold the GamePad vertically, swipe the screen in the direction they intend to bowl, and tilt the GamePad to change the ball's movement. ;Bird :A remake of the Pyoro mini-game from WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgames!, presented in a Game & Watch style presentation on the GamePad and a unique visual style on the TV. Players use Pyoro's elongated tongue to grab fruit falling from the air, trying to keep them from touching the ground, which destroys its footing, or landing on Pyoro's head, which results in a game over. Multiplayer titles ;Disco :Disco is a rhythm game for 2 players, hosted by Mike. Players take it in turns to come up with rhythmic button presses that the other player must bounce back in time to the music. ;Fruit :Fruit is a game for 2-5 players hosted by Penny. One player controls the GamePad and selects a character from several character options to be the thief. Their goal is to discreetly steal multiple fruit amongst a crowd of characters whilst not making their character noticed to the other players viewing the television screen. At various intervals, hints will appear on the TV showing the rough location of the thief. At the end of the game, the guessing players take turns to select who they believed to be the thief. ;Islands :Islands is a game for 2-5 players featuring Fronk. Players take turns using the GamePad to launch their Fronks onto a target board featuring various scoring zones. Players may also try to knock other players' Fronks around in the process. ;Sketch :Sketch (Artwork in PAL region) is a game for 2-5 players hosted by Orbulon. Similar to games like Pictionary, players take turn holding the GamePad and must draw pictures based on certain clues whilst the other players guess what the clue is. Points are awarded for the number of correctly guessed pictures drawn within the time limit. Development The game was initially conceived as a technical demonstration of the Wii U GamePad's features, to be pre-installed on every Wii U system. However, in the summer of 2012 it was decided that the game would be released as full software after the development team felt they had created too many ideas to be pre- installed. After much experimentation, the team decided to release the game with a Wario theme. Some of the games were also used as Wii U technical demonstrations at E3 2011. In May 2013, Nintendo of America launched Crowdfarter, a parody of Kickstarter, to encourage fans to promote the game via social media. Reception Game & Wario received mixed reviews with a current score of 61 in Metacritic. Famitsu gave the game a score of 31/40. IGN gave the game a score of 5.1, criticizing a sparse game selection with only a few excellent ones. GameTrailers gave the game a score of 6.5, stating the clever ideas are overshadowed by uninspired mini-games. GameSpot gave the game a score of 5.0, calling it \\"too uneven and frustrating to wholly recommend.\\" Destructoid gave the game a score of 7.5, stating that despite some unoriginality, all of the games are polished and fun. Game Informer gave the game an 8.0, noting how it \\"showcases the Wii U’s unique features well\\" while calling the number of multiplayer games \\"disappointingly small\\".Kyle Hilliard 21 June 2013 (2013-06-21). \\"Wario Trades Up From Micro To Mini\\". Game Informers. Retrieved 2013-07-23 Eurogamer scored the game a 6 out 10, stating that \\"There's fun to be had, but this isn't the reliable source of brilliant design that it should be. If you expected breezy old Wario to make sense of the Wii U in some fundamental manner, you're going to be disappointed by a game that occasionally seems quietly defeated by its host platform. You'll hope for an epiphany, but in Game & Wario's least inspired moments, what you'll get can feel uncomfortably close to an inquest.\\" The game sold 81,837 physical units in Japan. In the United States, it sold 36,000 units . Combined, the game sold 117,837 units in Japan and the United States.

Sometra, established in 1939, produced non-ferrous metals, particularly zinc and lead, through smelting; production has been suspended since 2009. Carbosin, dating to 1935, specialized in carbon black, and shut down in 1993. The two were the town's principal employers, but combined, they made it among the most polluted places in Eastern Europe. Soot from Carbosin encased Copșa Mică in a black covering, while metals from Sometra suffused the air, water and soil, leading to serious health effects on surrounding residents, vegetation and wildlife. The factories=Sometra Sometra in operation, 2005 Sometra was founded as a private firm in 1939 for the purpose of zinc smelting. Initially, it had three distillation furnaces, with five more added in 1948, the year it was nationalized by the new communist regime. Its initial capacity was 3000 tons of zinc per year, expanded to 4000 tons in 1946. \\"History\\" at the Sometra site; accessed June 5, 2012 Between 1950 and 1960, capacity was gradually expanded to 28,000 tons a year. In 1955, a unit for producing sulfuric acid was inaugurated. The unit was expanded in 1966, a year that also saw the introduction of a system for agglomerating concentrates of zinc and lead. This was the culmination of a four-year program of thorough restructuring and modernization, with the new equipment having a capacity of 30,000 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of lead bullion per year. The 1967-1970 period saw the introduction of an electrolytic lead refining system (capacity 24,000 tons a year); a unit for extracting metallic bismuth for technical and pharmaceutical use from anode sludge, as well as gold and silver alloys and antimony slag; a unit for zinc sulfate production; a unit for zinc and ammonium chloride production; and an air preheater. Capacity was doubled between 1975 and 1984. A second zinc and lead extraction unit, with annual capacities of 30,000 tons (zinc) and 20,000 tons (lead) went online, as well as two thermal zinc refineries and greater cadmium refining. In 1983, metallic antimony production began by extracting the metal from slag, along with sodium thioantimoniate and stibnite. In 1984, a second blast furnace began operation, so that the old components built from 1939 to 1957 were retired. Between 1985 and 1989, zinc powder production began and a system for collecting residual gases was put in place. In 1988, a 250 m high chimney was built. By 1989, the plant was annually generating 43,490 tons of sulfuric acid (against a projected capacity of 126,000 tons), 23,519 tons of electrolytic lead (below the 38,000 tons projected), 29,840 tons of pure zinc, 2,094 tons of zinc powder, 19 tons of cadmium, 29 tons of bismuth and 195 tons of antimony. The communist regime, which considered the factory crucial to the national economy and did not export its products, collapsed in 1989. Starting in 1990, production continuously fell, reaching 25% of its former level. However, output recovered to 1989 levels in some categories in 1995-1996. Starting in late 1992, efforts at updating the plant were made, including better gas purification at the agglomeration unit and blast furnace, completion of the tall chimney and a new dust filtration and water recirculation system. By 1997, some 40% of employees were laid off.Reconstrucția..., p.6 The firm was privatized in 1998 when it was sold to Mytilineos Holdings.Reconstrucția..., p.5 It was the country's only producer of lead and zinc concentrate. In early 2009, due to a major fall in zinc and lead orders brought on by the global financial crisis, 80% of employees or over 700 people were laid off. The remainder were kept on for equipment maintenance, and the factory was temporarily shut down. Including their dependents, this measure affected nearly a third of the town's inhabitants, as well as provoking significant losses to the town budget.

Carbosin Abandoned Carbosin, 1996 Carbosin was founded in 1935, mainly for producing carbon black from methane gas. The government of Czechoslovakia invested in the enterprise in order to develop its defense capabilities, ordering munitions and arms for its infantry.Petre Opriș, \\"Industria românească de apărare înainte de înființarea organizației Tratatului de la Varșovia\\", in Anuarul Institutului de Istorie 'George Barițiu' - Series Historica, Nr. XLIV (2005), p.463-482 In 1939, following the German occupation, the 20% interest of Československá zbrojovka was taken over by the Nazi regime, contributing to the crippling of Romania's efforts to maintain an army outside German control.David Turnock, The Economy of East Central Europe, 1815-1989, p. 255. London: Routledge, 2004, From 1950 to 1970, new units for producing carbon black were set up, as well as for formic and oxalic acid and methyl methacrylate. The company's products were the chief raw materials for various objects made of rubber (tires, transmission belts, conveyor belts, protective clothes and shoes), but were also used in the chemical, pharmaceutical, agricultural and other industries. The output of various types of carbon black amounted to 24,400 tons in 1989 (63,000 tons had been projected), a number that steadily decreased until 1993, when the factory was shut down following lengthy negotiations. Black dust pollution affected a strip of land over 20 km in length and 5–6 km in width, although work was later done to clean this up. Traian Deleanu, \\"Miracolul de la Copșa Mică\\", Evenimentul Zilei, May 11, 2011; accessed June 5, 2012 Environmental impact By the early 1990s, Copșa Mică was among the most polluted towns in Eastern Europe.Elizabeth Economy, The River Runs Black: The Environmental Challenge To China's Future, p.223. Cornell University Press, 2005, Over 60 years of unrestricted emissions led to lower air quality, surface water contamination, soil pollution, contaminated plant products and health risks to farm animals and human inhabitants. Until operations were suspended, Sometra remained the area's chief polluter, its emissions of sulfur dioxide and dust affecting all aspects of the environment.Reconstrucția..., p.6-7 A March 1990 New York Times report describes the town: \\"For about 15 miles around, every growing thing in this once-gentle valley looks as if it has been dipped in ink. Trees and bushes are black; the grass is stained. The houses and streets look like the inside of a chimney. Even the sheep on the hillsides are a dingy gray.\\" Horses could only live there for two years,Celestine Bohlen, \\"Through a Thick Veil of Soot, Romanian City Faces Future\\", The New York Times, March 5, 1990; accessed June 5, 2012 and the only animal life in the immediate area were wildfowl, the meat of which was inedible from the toxins.Peritore, p.195 In 1977, 70 residents had excessive or dangerous lead levels, a figure that had risen to over 400 by 1990, when over half of Sometra employees had above- normal lead. One test of nearly 3000 residents showed over half had lead poisoning. From 1983 to 1993, some 2000 people were hospitalized due to lead- induced anemia or severe lung and stomach pains. Of local children aged two to fourteen, 96% had chronic bronchitis and respiratory problems. Studies of children seven to twelve years old from Copșa Mică and Mediaș found that many showed signs of mental retardation, two-thirds were underweight and 30% of boys and nearly half of girls had high blood pressure.Open Media Research Institute, p.325 Five babies were born with malformed hearts between 1977 and 1983, a number that rose to 16 in 1988 alone. In 1985, a local doctor wrote a detailed report that ended up in the hands of dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu, earning him a visit from the Securitate secret police and leading to construction of the tall chimney that spewed sulfuric emissions toward nearby villages. Residents were dependent on the factory for their livelihood, saw the pollution as part of reality and were reluctant to agitate for change. Effect on vegetation Local authorities became aware of damage to vegetation caused by the factories by the early 1960s, a phenomenon that widened and intensified over time. In 1961, some 100 ha of trees, those in direct proximity to the sources of pollution, were afflicted. This figure had risen to 1650 ha by 1973 and nearly 8000 ha in 1978. Studies in 1988 and 1999 revealed that the entirety of the forests managed from Mediaș were polluted-- 20,110 ha in the earlier study, or 17,247 ha in 1999, following the transfer of two parcels to Dumbrăveni. Starting in 1988, pollution was also observed in neighboring forest districts: Dumbrăveni (947 ha), Agnita (60 ha), Blaj (8,900 ha), so that over 30,000 ha were polluted, a number that remained constant in 1999. The intensity of damage also grew.Reconstrucția..., p.13 In 1973, 120 ha of Mediaș forests fell into the category of most severe damage. This grew to 900 ha in 1978, nearly 2600 ha in 1988 and over 4500 ha in 1999. The Micăsasa and Târnava forests are the most polluted, the Șeica Mică and Boian ones less so, and those at Dârlos the least.Reconstrucția..., p.14 Natural regrowth of forests has been made more difficult in the least polluted areas, while in the severely to moderately polluted zones, it had stopped completely or was trending in that direction by 2008. Planting trees, even with additional costs such as fertilizer, has not always been successful either, due to soil contamination and elevated acidity. For instance, between 1994 and 1998, planting yielded a success rate of between 12 and 95%. Erosion, landslides and repeated fires have taken place, and trees' beneficial effects on climate, water and air quality have been seriously diminished or eliminated.Reconstrucția..., p.14-15 Replanting of intensely polluted soil started in 1988 and by 2008, 644 ha had been replanted,Reconstrucția..., p.16 with the Black Locust proving especially well adapted, among other species.Reconstrucția..., p.18, 20 Upon privatization of Sometra in 1998, the government, in accordance with a 1995 law, stipulated that fourteen steps would have to be taken by 2002. These would lessen the plant's environmental impact by reducing gas and toxic dust emissions. One step was to plant 40-50 ha of trees on the banks of the Târnava Mare River; trees paid for by the company were planted on 35 ha between 2000 and 2003. With Sometra shuttered, the year 2010 marked the first since measurements were taken that air pollution did not exceed legal limits. Plants began to regrow in forests that were shrinking as late as 2001. Whereas moles and hedgehogs had disappeared and rabbits and deer had migrated to cleaner areas, rabbits, foxes, wild boars and deer later returned. Isolated honeybee colonies and other insect species also reappeared.

Nuhn. He described his background as Middle Western of mixed German, Swiss and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.Nuhn, The Wind Blew From the East He lived in various sections of the country, from California to Vermont, and married noted Iowa writer Ruth Suckow in 1929.White, \\"Biography of Ruth Suckow Nuhn.\\" He was a literary critic, teacher, writer, and artist; he and his wife were both active in the Quakers and part of the Conscientious Objectors movement in World War II. After his wife’s death, in 1960, he worked to preserve her literary legacy, founded the Ruth Suckow Memorial Association, remarried Georgeanna (Georgia) Washburn Dafoe, and taught at Claremont College before retiring. He died in 1989 after the death of his second wife, and is buried beside Ruth in Greenwood Cemetery in Cedar Falls, Iowa.Grant, \\"Ferner Nuhn.\\" The 1998 Ruth Suckow Newsletter.  Early life  Nuhn attended Lincoln School through fourth grade, Jefferson (or West) School through sixth and Lincoln again through eighth grade. He graduated from Cedar Falls High School with the class of 1920. Local Historian Dorothy Grant describes his family this way: his father was in banking and real estate while his mother was a homemaker. He had two siblings: Marjorie and Hilde.Grant, \\"Ferner Nuhn\\" The 1998 Ruth Suckow Newsletter. He attended North Central College in Naperville, Illinois, graduating with a B. A. in 1924; he described discovering that he liked English literature during this period of time. His uncle, Dr. Edwin Roll, was the President of North Central College at this time.Grant, \\"Ferner Nuhn\\" The 1998 Ruth Suckow Newsletter He received a fellowship and went on to study at the University of Illinois, where he received an M. A. in English Literature in 1925. He also took several courses at Iowa State Teachers College. Later he taught freshman rhetoric at Urbana. During that time he discovered contemporary American poetry as well as fiction, and especially admired Robert Frost, Carl Sandburg and Vachel Lindsay.Nuhn, \\"The Wind Blew From the East\\"  Writing career begins  Nuhn drove a Yellow Cab in Chicago and used the pseudonym of Yellow to contribute a number of items to the Daily News column run by Keith Preston. He enrolled at Columbia University graduate school, with the idea of continuing an academic career, which ended when H. L. Mencken accepted one of his stories for the American Mercury. Dorothy Grant says that Nuhn said, “I decided I already knew too much,” and stopped taking classes to have more time to write. This led to the publication of a number of stories, reviews, and articles in The New Yorker, The Nation, The New Republic, The American Mercury, The Christian Century, and other magazines, especially Quaker publications.Grant, \\"Ferner Nuhn.\\" The 1998 Ruth Suckow Newsletter Nuhn had been reading the work of Ruth Suckow when, in August 1926, he visited her in Earlville, Iowa. Ruth kept eighty hives of bees in an apiary there while establishing herself as a writer. Dorothy Grant writes that Nuhn described their meeting when he helped to dedicate the Ruth Suckow Memorial Park in Earlville in 1982. He had driven to Earlville from Cedar Falls, they had a long afternoon of good conversation, and then they were invited to a chicken dinner at a neighbor’s house. They enjoyed discussing literature, among other topics. Rebecca Christian wrote a one-woman play about Ruth Suckow, called “Just Suppose,” and to prepare for it, read much of the correspondence of Suckow and Nuhn, now housed in the Special Collections of the University of Iowa’s library, where it fills 56 boxes. Christian wrote, “During this period (of bee keeping) a letter arrived from a young literary critic in Cedar Falls who asked for ‘disposition towards pilgrims visiting you: if or when you are at ‘home.’” She apparently said yes, because he drove his Model T to Earlville, beginning a relationship that lasted both of their lives.Christian, \\"She Wrote of Iowa and Life.\\"Christian, \\"Just Suppose.\\" When they met, Ruth was 36 and Nuhn was 25: the age difference did not seem to bother him, but troubled her at first. They shared a love of cats, and Nuhn once playfully compared Ruth to his cat, Persephone, telling her that he wasn't afraid of her sharp claws: \\"...both of you have sharp claws, though neither of you use them much,\\"qtd. in Grant, \\"Ferner Nuhn.\\" From a Letter, August 27, 1928 Ruth Suckow Papers, Special Collections, University of Iowa. Nuhn and Suckow continued their friendship in New York City, where he attended Columbia University graduate school. His interest in writing was encouraged by the publication of several stories in The American Mercury, edited by H. L. Mencken, in 1927-28.  Marriage and travels  Nuhn and Suckow were married in San Diego, California on March 11, 1929. Ruth wrote to her aunt, “We start out with several things in our disfavor, but a very great deal of love in our favor.” An observer said, “Ferner found an artist who could translate the Midwest, and in Ferner, Ruth found a critic who could understand the translation.”Christian, \\"She Wrote of Iowa and Life\\" Rebecca Christian describes the next seven years of Nuhn and Ruth’s lives together by saying that they traveled extensively: “roosting and writing in cabins, ramshackle old houses or writers’ colonies in places such as the Iowa Mississi river town of McGregor; northern Minnesota; Des Moines; the MacDowell Colony at Peterborough, N. H.; and Washington, D. C. They also visited the writers’ retreat, Yaddo in Saratoga Springs, where Suckow hated the pretentious atmosphere of artsy largesse from people ‘rotten with money’ but loved the quiet and the food.” At Yaddo, each writer had a small cabin and meals were brought on a tray and left at the door, so they could focus on their writing.Christian, \\"Just Suppose\\" At the MacDowell Colony, in Peterborough, New Hampshire, Nuhn began a series of oil character sketches he later called “Figures of the Thirties.” They included John Cowper Powys, Charles Wakefield Cadman, Robert Frost, Henry Wallace – and Charles Hearst, of Cedar Falls, The collection has been exhibited at the University of Northern Iowa. Dorothy Grant provides a more extensive explanation: Ruth and Ferner were at a writers’ workshop when he decided to sketch some of the people in the group. He wrote comments about the people he had sketched, and made copies of the booklet. Eventually, copies of the booklet were given to the Hearst Center, while the original is in the Special Collections Department at the University of Iowa library in Iowa City. Nuhn's collection of sketches showed his interest in people and their occupations. He wrote, “Most of the persons portrayed in this collection were fellow colonists of myself and my wife, Ruth Suckow, in the early 1930s, at Yaddo, the art colony near Saratoga Spring, New York....Included in the list are the names of some nationally-known artists, playwrights, poets, essayists, composers, and novelists as well as the name of Henry A. Wallace, who is described as “Agriculturist, Author, Statesman.” Dorothy Grant notes that the collection provides valuable insights into the political scene as well as the Arts during the 1930s. Others on the list of people he sketched include: * William Rose Benet—poet and playwright * Charles Wakefield Cadman—composer * Carl Carmer—novelist, editor, and conservationist * Leo Fisher—sculptor * Felix Fox—composer * Frances Frost—poet, fiction writer * Robert Frost—poet * Horace Gregory—poet, critic, and editor * Albert Halper—novelist * Roy Harris—composer * Charles Hearst—Iowa farmer * Jeffrey Levy—painter * John Cowper Powys—novelist, poet, essayist * Evelyn Scott—poet, novelist * Ruth Suckow—novelist * John Brooks Wheelwright—poet, critic * Henry A. Wallace—agriculturist, author, statesmanFerner Nuhn's booklet qtd. in Grant Two other paintings remain of Nuhn’s, now housed at the Ruth Suckow Library in Earlville. One is of Ruth’s cottage, while the other one shows one of their cats (always white). Nuhn also designed a bookplate for Ruth, including a cat.rant, \\"Ferner Nuhn.\\" The 1998 Ruth Suckow Newsletter. Nuhn wrote for a number of publications, including The Nation; one of his articles is available online.“The Farmer Learns Direct Action,” Nation 136 (March 8, 1933): 254–256 He describes witnessing a forced farm sale in Iowa in the 1930s. The article begins with the comment that “Some may think of farmers as conservative, but that view ignores a long tradition of rural radicalism in the United States. In the early years of the Great Depression, that radicalism found powerful expression in the subverting of farm foreclosures and tax sales. The technique was simple—when a farm was foreclosed for overdue taxes or failure to meet mortgage payments, neighbors would show up at the auction and intimidate any potential buyers. Then the farm and equipment would be purchased at a token price and returned to the original owner.”Nuhn, Ferner. “The Farmer Learns Direct Action,” Nation 136 (March 8, 1933): 254–256. History Matters. “Like a Thick Wall”: Blocking Farm Auctions in Iowa In 1934 Nuhn was invited to Washington, D. C. to work as a writer in the Agricultural Adjustment Administration under Henry A. Wallace. He served there for two years, enjoying learning something about the workings of the federal government. During part of this time he worked with Henry Wallace in the writing of Wallace’s book, Whose Constitution.Nuhn, \\"The Ice House.\\" In the fall of 1936, Nuhn and Ruth returned to Cedar Falls because his father was sick. They lived at 2215 Grand Boulevard until 1942, then at 1223 West Second Street. Nuhn helped his father manage his business property. On the death of his father, Nuhn continued in this role.Grant, \\"Ruth and Ferner.\\" The 1998 Ruth Suckow Newsletter. Nuhn and Ruth were both active in the community and enjoyed being part of the literary and social life of Cedar Falls. Dorothy and Martin Grant became acquainted with Ruth and Nuhn at this time. The two couples were part of a circle of friends who enjoyed many dinners and “fun and game” evenings. Furthermore, she writes that Ruth and Nuhn enjoyed watching the Waterloo, Cedar Falls, and Northern Trolley (W. C. F. & N.) trundle by. They rode it often and became such familiar passengers that the motorman would let them off right in front of their house rather than at the regular corner.Grant, \\"Ruth and Ferner.\\" The 1998 Ruth Suckow Newsletter Nuhn was interested in art, Dorothy writes, because his sister Marjorie was a talented artist. He founded the Cedar Falls Art League in the early 1940s and his mother, Anna, let him have a large upstairs room over the Miller Shoe store at 319 1/2 Main Street for the exhibits. This was an active organization, offering art classes for children and adults, displaying artwork in exhibits, and sponsoring receptions. Nuhn was its President for six years: Dorothy and her husband were charter members. The organization sought to encourage the showing and purchase of original paintings and other art by local and area artists. The present Hearst Center for the Arts grew out of that earlier organization. Nuhn came back to Cedar Falls to exhibit his sister Marjorie’s paintings in the old downtown high school. Marjorie was already in a nursing home, but appreciated his efforts. Dorothy remembers that Nuhn was a fine host and that he gave all of her remaining paintings to the Hearst Center, along with money for the Marjorie Nuhn Conservation Room. Dorothy Grant also notes that Nuhn enjoyed carpentry work and built a solid walnut desk for Ruth while they lived in Cedar Falls; she used the desk until they moved to Arizona. Later, the Grants purchased the desk in 1949 and donated it to the Ruth Suckow Memorial Library in Earlville in 1991. While living in Cedar Falls, Nuhn helped found the Supper Club, sometimes called The No Name Club, or Town and Gown. Dorothy S. Grant, wife of one of the other founders, Martin, describes it this way in her self-published booklet, The Cedar Falls Supper Club (June 1993). Not very long after Bill Reninger’s arrival in Cedar Falls, he and Jim Hearst, Paul Diamond, and Ferner Nuhn talked about organizing a discussion type club. By the fall of 1940, basic plans had been put together. There would be twelve members, half town, half Gown, with a wide range of interests. Meetings would be once a month in a place where a meal would be served in a private room. There would be a minimum of business, with no officers except a secretary who notified the members of the coming meeting, requested, and made reservations for the dinner. Each member would be assigned a certain month to give his paper and be responsible to inform the secretary of the title. Dorothy later describes Nuhn’s first talk, by recounting an interview done with Iver Christofferson, then 94. He remembered Nuhn’s talk as one of the most controversial Iver experienced in his years in Supper Club. Nuhn talked about Conscientious Objectors.Grant, \\"The Cedar Falls Supper Club.\\" This certainly fits with what we know about his wife, Ruth Suckow. Rebecca Christian writes that Suckow established contact with the conscientious objectors to World War II in 1943. (She had found World War I profoundly disturbing and her relationship with her father had been damaged by his activities supporting the war.) In 1944 she traveled to the West Coast to visit six Civilian Public Service camps and one mental hospital. She spoke on writing and literature, read manuscripts, and encouraged young men. Over the years Nuhn published work in a number of magazines, including The American Mercury, The Nation, New Republic, Christian Century, New Yorker, and other magazines. In 1942, Harper Brothers published his critical work, The Wind Blew from the East: a study in the orientation of American culture. It was reprinted in 1967 by Kennikat Press.Nuhn, Biographical note, \\"The Ice House.\\"  Retirement to California and death  In 1947, because of Ruth’s health problems, Nuhn and Ruth moved to Tucson, Arizona; Ruth had rheumatoid arthritis, while Nuhn had asthma and allergies, so they hoped to find relief in a warmer climate. Later, in 1952, they moved to Claremont, California. They lived in a small house at 420 West 8th Street and were active in the Society of Friends (Quakers). They returned to Iowa for visits. Nuhn taught at Claremont College in California. Ruth continued to write until her death, on January 23, 1960. After Ruth’s death, Nuhn remained active with the Claremont Religious Society of Friends. He wrote for Quaker periodicals and published several booklets on various topics relating to the Quaker faith, including Friends and the Ecumenical Movement (Philadelphia, 1970). He also worked to ensure that his wife’s literary legacy would remain strong; in 1964 the Earlville Library was renamed the Earlville-Ruth Suckow Memorial library, in the community where they had first met.Grant, Ferner Nuhn.\\" The 1998 Ruth Suckow Newsletter. Nuhn married Georgeanna (Georgia) Washburn Dafoe, who was a cousin of Ruth Suckow, in 1965. Her husband had died a decade earlier. The following year, 1966, he and Georgia worked with a group of people to form the Ruth Suckow Memorial Association (RSMA). Nuhn and Georgia gathered and organized Ruth's papers and donated them to the Special Collections at the University of Iowa. Georgia also created an exhibit for the Suckow Library in Earlville, donated a bookcase from Ruth's Father, and helped gather mementos to display in a glass case. Georgia led the efforts to preserve the cottage where Ruth once kept her bees and wrote; however, the structure was not in good condition, so the decision was made to tear it down and create a park in its place. So, in 1982 the RSMA established the Ruth Suckow Park in Earlville at the site of her former home. Nuhn and Georgia spoke at the dedication ceremony, held on June 12. It was Georgia's last visit to Earlville. She died May 28, 1984 and Nuhn wrote a moving tribute to her life and work in the Fall 1984 issue of the Ruth Suckow newsletter. He remembered her role in the efforts to establish the park: \\"The event was a fitting climax to Georgia's long labor of love in memory of Ruth Suckow.\\"Nuhn, \\"Tribute to a Founder...: The Fall 1984 Ruth Suckow Newsletter. Two years after Georgia's death, Nuhn moved to the Santa Rosa retirement facility in 1986. Three years later, at age 85, he died—on April 15, 1989, having been in frail health for some time. There was a local memorial service. His body was then sent to Cedar Falls, Iowa so that he could be buried next to his beloved wife, Ruth, in Greenwood Cemetery in Cedar Falls, Iowa. However, it was not until 2009 that a headstone was erected to mark the spot; members of the Ruth Suckow Memorial Association worked with his remaining family members to correct the oversight. Ruth is now buried between the two men who so strongly influenced her: her father, William Suckow, and her husband, Ferner Nuhn.  Literary legacy  While Nuhn was not the prolific writer that Ruth was, he was a critic, scholar and accomplished writer. He captured the plight of the Midwestern farmers during the Great Depression in his essay for the Nation about farm sales. In addition, he is credited with writing about the Society of Friends (Quakers). Furthermore, without his efforts to establish the Ruth Suckow Memorial Association and related activities to reprint some of her books, it is not certain that the current generation of readers would be able to read some of Ruth Suckow’s books. Two of Suckow's earlier books were reprinted, largely due to his advocacy and the establishment of the Ruth Suckow Memorial Association. The University of Iowa Press, in Iowa City, Iowa released The Folks (1992) and New Hope (1998). In addition, A Ruth Suckow Omnibus came out in 1988; this contained eleven of her short stories. It also included an introductory essay by Suckow Scholar Clarence A. Andrews, a longtime member of the RSMA. In the meantime, some of his work can still be enjoyed online: a collection of his short stories, book reviews, and articles can be viewed at Unz.org.Ferner Nuhn on Unz.org. In addition, he wrote several booklets published by Historical Societies and the Quakers.  References  Further reading  * Christian, Rebecca.

Second World War The squadron was formed on 22 February 1943. Post war The squadron reformed on 30 March 1949. Helicopter-only squadron From 28 August 1959 the squadron only used helicopters. 737 NAS was assigned to operate from Helicopter Support Ship RFA Engadine and later, from the flight decks of the eight County Class guided missile destroyers, including HMS Glamorgan (D19), HMS Antrim (D18) and HMS Norfolk (D21). 737 Squadron supported flights on these destroyers in addition to providing aircrew training at RNAS Portland. In their ship-borne, anti-submarine role, the HAS.3s could carry two Mark 44 torpedoes or Mark 46 torpedoes (with parachutes) or four Mk.11 Depth Charges in addition to their Plessey dipping Sonar. They could also be fitted with a door-mounted Machine gun and act as a self-contained unit, handling all operations of Anti-submarine warfare(ASW). Throughout the late 1970s most of the Wessex HAS.3 helicopters at RNAS Portland were being replaced by Westland Sea Kings, which could carry more torpedoes or depth charges and had the security of twin engines, with greatly extended endurance. Falklands War A few HAS.3s, remained in service until after the Falklands War period in 1982. One of these, XP142, was seriously damaged near San Carlos Water, was replaced by XM328, on HMS Antrim, in November 1982. XM328 then sailed with HMS Antrim (D18) on her second deployment to the South Atlantic. HMS Antrim was the Flagship of Operation Paraquet, the recovery of South Georgia in April 1982. Her helicopter, the Westland Wessex HAS.3 XP142, nicknamed \\"Humphrey\\", was responsible for the remarkable rescue of 16 SAS men from Fortuna Glacier and the subsequent detection and disabling of the Argentinian submarine Santa Fe.

There are several theories emphasizing different factors which may shape citizens' voting behavior. Many influential theories ignore the possible influence of individuals' networks in forming vote choices and focus mainly on the effects of own political attitudes – such as party loyalties or party identification developed in childhood proposed by the Michigan model, or on the influence of rational calculations about the political parties’ ideological positions as proposed by spatial and valence theories.Bartels, L. M. (2010). The Study of Electoral Behavior. In: Leighley, J. E. (ed.) The Oxford Handbook of American Elections and Political Behavior. New York: Oxford University Press, 239-261.Sanders, D., Clarke, H. D., Stewart, C. M., & Whiteley, P. (2011). Downs, Stokes and the Dynamics ofElectoral Choice. British Journal of Political Science, 41: 287-314. These theories offer models of electoral behavior in which individuals are not analyzed within their social networks and environments. In a more general context, some authors warn that the hypothesis testing done mainly based on sample surveys and focused on individuals’ attributes without looking at relational data (relations among individuals) seems to be a poor methodological instrument.Savage, M., & Burrows, R. (2007). The Coming Crisis of Empirical Sociology. Sociology, 41(5): 885-899. However, models emphasizing the influence of individuals’ social networks in shaping their electoral choices have been also present in the literature from the very beginning.  Theories emphasizing the relevance of networks  There are three main (theoretical and empirical) approaches emphasizing the importance of networks in shaping electoral decisions: using surveys to measure actors’ (in this case voters’) attitudes (Columbia Studies), measuring collective patterns of social groups on an aggregate level as supplementary information (Contextual analysis) and focusing on interpersonal dynamics among individuals.Boudourides, M. A. (2004). A Review of Network Theories on the Formation of Public Opinion. Electronic Journal of Communication, 14:1-19.  Columbia Studies  The relevance of networks in individuals' electoral choices was first identified by Lazarsfeld and his colleagues in The People's Choice: How the Voter Makes Up His Mind in a Presidential Campaign and in Voting: A Study of Opinion Formation in a Presidential Campaign. Their findings were mainly based on a survey gathered in 1940 in Erie County, Ohio and on a survey collected in 1948 in Elmira, New York. The model proposed by them is usually referred to as the model of Columbia Studies. Individuals' perception of the political world is conceptualized in network terms according to this model. The main argument of these books is that the interpersonal influence of their families, friends and co-workers form voters’ political views. Voters’ choices are shaped through interpersonal communication networks. These horizontal networks have a stronger effect on individuals’ political decisions than the opinions and viewpoints presented and framed in the media. Social categories – such as religion and class – may also explain individuals’ choices. A businessman with friends and co-workers from that class is more likely to vote for a Republican candidate than a blue-collar worker.Knoke, D. (1990). Political Networks. The Structural Perspective. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. The findings may be concluded in the following way: \\"they (voting decisions) are relatively invulnerable to direct argumentation and vulnerable to indirect social influences”.Berelson, B., Lazarfeld, P.F., & McPhee, W.N. (1954). Voting: A Study of Opinion Formation in a Presidential Campaign. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.p. 331 Major criticisms of this model were developed on their data collection methods. Respondents were asked about the possible opinions of their three best friends and three closest co-workers. However, not the actual opinions of these individuals, rather respondents' perceptions of their opinions were collected. This is why some authors think that the Columbia Studies can not be regarded as a predecessor of social network analysis.Eulau, H. (1980). The Columbia Studies of Personal Influence: Social Network Analysis. Social Science History, 4(2): 207-228.  Contextual analysis  The main claim of the literature on contextual analysis is that individuals live in a social environment that should be taken into account when one analyzes their political orientations. The particular social or political context (which may be institutional, occupational or residential for instance) someone lives in shapes his/her interpersonal interactions and thus his/her political behavior.Johnson, M., Shively, W. P., & Stein, R. M. (2010). Contextual data and the study of elections and voting behavior: Connecting individuals to environments. Electoral Studies, 21(2): 219-233. Coming back to the previous example blue-collar workers are more likely to support a Republican candidate if they live in a neighborhood where most of the residents are white-collar workers than those blue-collars workers who live in neighborhoods with a higher percentage of blue-collar worker residents. One may see that the logic of this approach is very close to that of the Columbia Studies but is more focused on communities and contains a lower explicit emphasis on interpersonal networks.  Interpersonal dynamics  The third approach focuses on interpersonal interactions with the assumption that individuals are members of networks in which political information spreads through communication. Information with higher quality spreading through the communication channels probably has a stronger effect on political choices.  Empirical data on the relevance of networks in electoral choices  Although there are several possible research designs to analyze networks in political context, the relevance of networks in shaping electoral choices has been approached in three main manners – all being observational research designs.Nickerson, D. W. (2011). Social Networks and Political Context. In.: Druckman, J., Green, D. P., Kuklinski, J., & Lupia, S. (eds.) Handbook of Experimental Political Science. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 273-288. Firstly, most of the authors follow the data gathering technique and research design of Columbia Studies. It means that the randomly chosen respondents within a limited area are asked about their closest friends/relatives/co-workers (sometimes also about the closeness of this particular relationships) and about their possible political orientations. One famous example was done by Laumann in 1973 in Detroit in which he shows that the closer the ties are for a respondent, the greater the political homogeneity the network has.Laumann, E. O. (2006). A 45-year Retrospective on Doing Networks. Connections 27(1): 65-90.Wellman, B. (1993). An Egocentric Network Tale: Comment on Bien et al. (1991). Social Networks, 15: 423-436. Another example could be the work by Knoke (1990) which uses a very similar research design but is based on a national sample (the General Social Survey). He shows that both the extent to which respondents' environments are politicized and the frequency of political discussions they have influence their party choices. These studies may be done in either a cross-sectional design at one time point or in a panel design through the repeated measurement of the same individuals. Secondly and thirdly, the contextual analysis approach has come up with slightly different research designs. One way to incorporate information about respondents’ communities is to include aggregate level neighborhood characteristics in the individual level data. Another way to detect respondents’ communities is based on the snowball survey technique. Similarly to the research designs done by the Columbia Studies authors, respondents are asked about their closest friends. However, unlikely to those studies, in this case these friends are directly surveyed as well – thus not only the perception of their opinion is gathered.

St Saviour's Chapel was relocated from West Lyttelton to Christchurch's Cathedral Grammar School in the 1970s. Following the earthquakes and the demolition of Holy Trinity Church, Lyttelton, St Saviour's was returned to Lyttelton to the site of Holy Trinity in 2013. History Damage inside Holy Trinity Church in Lyttelton, which was later demolished and replaced by St Saviour's Chapel Benjamin Woolley Dudley (1805–1892) was the first vicar of Lyttelton, having arrived on the Cressy in 1850. In 1883, Dudley, by now Archdeacon of Rangiora, proposed that the parish of Lyttelton be split and a new church founded to minister both to residents of West Lyttelton and visiting seafarers. Dudley provided an endowment to assist with building and the provision of a minister. The parish of West Lyttelton was formed and a curate appointed in 1885. Cyril Mountfort was chosen as the architect for the chapel. It is built in Early English Gothic Revival style and constructed of timber, with a steeply pitched roof and narrow lancet windows. During construction, sections of the building were transported onto the chosen site (the corner of Simeon Quay and Brittan Terrace in West Lyttelton) and bolted together. St Saviour's was consecrated on 29 October 1885 by Bishop Harper. The design allowed for three further sections to be added later, but the predicted growth of the congregation did not happen and the chapel was not extended. Robert Falcon Scott and crew worshipped here prior to the Discovery and Terra Nova expeditions. Scott and his polar party reached the South Pole on the latter expedition but died on their return journey. In 1964, the urban area of Lyttelton was united into one parish, and over time, St Saviour's became secondary, with the focus being on Holy Trinity Church at 17 Winchester Street. In 1975, the parishioners offered the building to the Christchurch Diocese and the decision was made to give the chapel to Cathedral Grammar School. The chapel was dismantled into its sections and transported by truck to a site on the corner of Chester Street West and Park Terrace in Christchurch Central City. The chapel was erected on the school grounds in January and February 1976. Its Lyttelton site was used for housing for the elderly. The original altar was given to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) for use in the Antarctic and is now in the Chapel of the Snows at McMurdo Station. St Saviour's Chapel itself suffered only light damage in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, but land damage means that it would be necessary to remove the chapel from its site so that ground remediation could be carried out. Paul Kennedy, the headmaster of Cathedral Grammar School, offered the chapel to the Christchurch Diocese, with Bishop Victoria Matthews in turn deciding that of the three applicants, the chapel be given to Lyttelton as a replacement for Holy Trinity Church, which had been demolished after the earthquakes. Christchurch City Council gave a heritage incentive grant of NZ$143k in July 2013 towards the relocation costs. The foundation for the new church was laid on 18 August 2013 by Bishop Matthews. The St Saviour's building was cut into ten pieces, and in September 2013 moved, through Gebbies Pass, to its new home. Renamed St Saviour's at Holy Trinity, it was consecrated by Bishop Matthews on 7 June 2015. Anglicans have worshipped on the site since 1850 and St Saviour's is the third church building there. The main structure is largely St Saviour's but it has been turned around on its axis so that what was originally the sanctuary is now the nave at the west end. The porch of Holy Trinity was added to St Saviour's and the altar and other features re-used. A notable element saved from the former church on the site is the William Butterfield-designed stained glass window in the sanctuary. The 1865 organ from Holy Trinity has been refurbished by the South Island Organ Company. Heritage registration The church was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a Category II heritage building on 24 June 2005 with registration number 1929. It became Category I on 1 May 2017.

He was the son of a deacon Sigvard Andreas Tvedt (1876–1965) and Martha Carens Kruse (1882-1966) and married to physical therapist Inger Torgersen (b. 1924). He was nephew to the pastor Just Kruse (1886–1962), and cousin to Colonel Erling O. Kruse (b. 1922) and physiotherapists Astrid E. Kruse Andersen (b. 1926). Tvedt grew up in Bergen, Norway, and after the completion of examen artium in 1930, he went to Germany and was trained as a physiotherapist. He then studied medicine at the University of Oslo, and was MD in 1942. After the fire in University Hall in November 1943, he fled to Sweden and came to Uppsala. There he worked for a period as a doctor for Norwegian refugees and he got to work for a sports and work physiologist, Professor Torgny Sjöstrand. After the Second World War, sports and work physiology was his main interest. He was a doctor for the Norwegian athletes at several world championships and Olympic Games. As a sports physician, his caught interest in strain disorders, and put a lot of effort into such problems. In 1946 he was connected to the Oslo Orthopedic Institute as a teacher and was later education leader until the state took over the institute in 1966 and called it the Norwegian School of Physiotherapy. He ran the department together with Dr. Otto Holmboe until Holmboe's death. Then he was responsible for the main teaching of Norwegian physiotherapists. As a teacher Tvedt was a pioneer who used very unorthodox methods of teaching. It meant that he was controversial, but his strong point was never drawn into question. As a physiotherapist, his mantra was motion. Under the leadership of Tvedt, people in various professions was filmed, then the employees together with Tvedt studied the video to learn how to see how they could improve their working position. When Erling Stordahl started his health sports center at Beitostølen, Tvedt was in place as an active consultant. The Director of Health Karl Evang was of the opinion that Tvedt with his ideas about physical activity was 20 to 30 years ahead of its time. Tvedt was for years associated with the Police Academy and was an active promoter of Norwegian police officers' physical education. He was also special medic for many years at the Oslo Police District's occupational health.

Pearce (1817–1887) was a politician and African Methodist Episcopal (AME) minister in Florida from 1865 until his death. An African American missionary, he helped bring the AME Church to Florida and worked to build its congregation during and after the Reconstruction Era. It was the first independent black denomination in the United States. Pearce was born into slavery in Maryland and bought his freedom then moved North to New Haven, Connecticut, where he was ordained, and later to Canada, where he served as a preacher and became a British citizen. In 1868 Pearce was elected as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention of 1868 of Florida. Later that year he was elected to the state legislature from Leon County, Florida. He served numerous terms in the legislature, working to gain support for public education for all Floridians. Early life, education and career as minister Pearce was born into slavery in 1817 in Queen Anne's County, Maryland. As a young man, he purchased his freedom by saving his portion of earnings from being \\"hired out.\\" He moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where he studied and was ordained as a minister in the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church. Founded in 1816 by free blacks in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, this was the first independent black denomination in the United States. Pearce later moved to Canada and became a British citizen, as it was still a colony. An estimated 20,000 -30,000 refugee African Americans from the United States had settled there to gain freedom from slavery. He preached there until 1865. AME missionary to the South In 1865, after the Civil War, Pearce moved to Florida as an AME missionary. Based in the North, the church sent numerous missionaries to the South to aid the freedmen and plant new churches. Pearce settled in Tallahassee and Leon County, Florida. Pearce said, \\"A man in this State, cannot do his whole duty as a minister except he looks out for the political interests of his people.\\"Canter Brown Jr., Florida's Black Public Officials, 1867-1924, (Tuscaloosa: The University of Alabama Press, 1998), p. 4 Pearce became a prominent black officeholder in the Reconstruction era, a time when threats, the KKK, and white animosity to freedmen was high.Dorothy Dodd, \\"'Bishop' Pearce and the Reconstruction of Leon County\\", Apalachee (1946), p. 6. White insurgents formed paramilitary groups to disrupt elections and intimidate black voters, in an effort to suppress the Republican Party. Political career While helping establish new congregations of the AME Church, Pearce also joined the Republican Party and built political power through these networks. Most freedmen joined the Republicans. Pearce was elected to the Constitutional Convention of 1868 of Florida. He was expelled by moderate Republicans because of his British citizenship. Later in 1868, Pearce was elected as a Republican to the Florida Senate, serving one term until 1870. He was elected again in 1872, and served to 1884. In this period, during the Reconstruction Era, he was considered the political boss of Leon County, Florida, where the freedmen constituted the majority of the population. Pearce was influential in his support (and, in some cases, opposition to others seeking office or in office). Pearce also helped establish educational institutions, including the predecessor to what became Edward Waters College in Jacksonville, Florida, which was affiliated with the AME Church.History Edward Waters College. He also gained state legislative support of education for all Floridians.Larry E. Rivers, Canter Brown Jr.Laborers in the Vineyard of the Lord: The Beginnings of the AME Church in Florida, 1865-1895, University Press of Florida, 2001portrait In an act of political payback, in November 1876 Pearce was challenged and disqualified as an elector for the Republican Rutherford B. Hayes and William Wheeler ticket, at the time that votes for electors were still being tallied from various counties. He had been convicted by a circuit court in 1870 of a felony for offering a bribe. Although he was pardoned on April 29, 1872 by Acting Governor Samuel T. Day and E. M. Randall, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, as certified in December 1876 by the Secretary of State in Florida, votes cast for him in the presidential election were not accepted. His opponents noted there was no provision under Florida law to allow a convicted felon, even though pardoned, to regain his right to vote or serve as an elector.Congressional Edition, Volume 1733, pp. 14 and 387 Through the waning years of Reconstruction, white conservative Democrats made other efforts to dispute and prevent the seating of black electors, or voting by blacks for other Republican candidates, and there was considerable violence and intimidation at the elections. Pearce also had rivals within the AME church and among the leaders of the black Baptist Church in Florida. Many of the latter had quickly established independence with their congregations after the war from the white-dominated Southern Baptist Church.

It was named by Harry Seeley in 1870 as a family that contains Ornithocheirus and its relatives. The name was emended to Ornithocheiridae, to match the requirements of the ICZN Code that a family-ranked clade should end with an -idae suffix. Brian Andres (2010) in his review of pterosaur phylogeny, defined the name Ornithocheirae phylogenetically, as a node-based taxon consisting of the last common ancestor of Anhanguera and Ornithocheirus and all its descendants. Thus Ornithocheirae is defined to include two families, the Anhangueridae and the Ornithocheiridae, following the opinion of Alexander KellnerKellner, A. W.

He was a founding member of the Department of Anthropology at the University of California, San Diego, where he served as a member of the faculty for 36 years. During his career, Swartz was a founding member of the Society for Cultural Anthropology, former chairman of the American Society for Political Anthropology, a life member of the American Anthropological Association, a fellow of the Royal Anthropological Institute and a member of the National Geographic Research board of editors. Swartz conducted extensive field research among indigenous peoples in highland Tanzania (the Bena), in Kenya (coastal Swahili, and on Chuuk atoll (formerly known as Truk) in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. In each case he was accompanied and assisted by his wife of 58 years, Audrey. Swartz dedicated his career to the study of the influence of culture over various aspects of human interaction, including the sources and maintenance of political power, social status, aggression, sexuality and medical beliefs. “He believed that human cultures were defined by common understandings that were shared, transmitted, prescriptive and morally forceful. He disputed the casual use of the word ‘culture’ to refer to artifacts or behaviors. To him, culture was what’s in your head,” said David K. Jordan, UC San Diego professor emeritus of anthropology and a longtime friend and colleague to Swartz.

The Phoenicians established a foothold around 650 BC.Ibiza and Formentera’s Heritage, a Non-clubber’s Guide; by Paul R. Davis. Barbury Press, 2009, On this site archaeologists have discovered the remains of simple stone buildings. The discovery is so important that the site has been designated a World Heritage Site. History and Location The Phoenicians began arriving on the island of Ibiza around 650 BC and constructed this settlement on the rocky headland at Sa Caleta.The Rough Guide to Ibiza and Formentera; by Ian Stewart. Rough Guides Ltd, 2003, This large Phoenician settlement was uncovered by archaeologists during the 1980s and 1990s under the auspices of the Consell Insular d’Eivissa i Formentera. The site was declared a World Heritage Site in December 1999. The site consists of an urban area with streets and a small square, conventionally referred to as ‘neighbourhoods’. The Phoenicians who first settled here had arrived from the Iberian coast and settled here progressively until all the usable space on this headland had become a veritable urban center and once covered a surface area of 4 hectares. Economic Activities A factor in the choice of the location was its proximity to the natural salt marshes of the island. The Phoenicians exploited this valuable natural commodity. The shallow pools of seawater within the marsh evaporated under the hot summer sun enjoyed by the island, leaving a gleaming crust of salt crystals. The Phoenicians collected these deposits and so began the first commercial enterprise of the island. The settlers also engaged in other activities which included fishing, baking, weaving and metalworking, all of which was used to trade to supplement the meager local produce of the island. Visiting Sa Caleta is located on the south west coast of the island about 10 kilometers from Ibiza town. The site is preserved behind tall iron railings behind which are the restored and preserved footings of several dwellings. The remains have been designated the ‘southern quarter’ of the settlement by the archaeologists who have excavated the site. Most of the buildings, of which there are half a dozen, are grouped around narrow streets and courtyards. The main construction of these buildings would have been built from stone and mud-brick with flat clay roofs supported on timber rafters. Most of the buildings consisted of just one room and were a combination of living space, workshops and store rooms. There is one building in the centre of the site which has multiple rooms and may have been a structure of some importance in its day. The plan of this house is comparable to other Phoenician dwellings excavated in other parts of the Mediterranean, and is not dissimilar to the layout of the traditional house built on Ibiza until recent times. The excavations on the central area near the top of the headland revealed an orderly arrangement of building in the form of a terrace, although this area has not been conserved for public viewing. The site would have been larger, but many of the buildings to south have been lost to coastal erosion. To the North of the site much of the archaeology was destroyed during the Spanish civil war when concrete gun emplacements, tunnel and huts were constructed on the headland as part of the islands elaborate defense system set up to guard against any Republican attack during mid 1937.. This construction was built with no regard for the delicate archeology in the area. The small cove on the east side of Sa Caleta was once the busy natural harbor of the Phoenician settlers. It is still used today by a few local fishing boats and the occasional pleasure craft.

It was also released as a single and reached No. 31 on the Billboard Hot 100, spending five weeks on the chart. It also reached No. 27 in Canada. Writing and recording According to Scholz, the lyrics for \\"A Man I'll Never Be\\" came to him quickly after he completed the music. Brad Delp sang the lead and backing vocals and Scholz played lead and rhythm guitar, organ and piano. The only other musician on the recording was drummer Sib Hashian The song was mostly recorded at Scholz's Hideaway Studio, although the piano part was recorded by engineer Dave Butler at Northern Studio in Maynard, Massachusetts,https://www.discogs.com/artist/1305291-Dave-Butler-6 allegedly because Hideaway was too small to fit the piano. Lyrics and music \\"A Man I'll Never Be\\" is a change of pace from the songs on Boston's debut album and some of the other songs on Don't Look Back. AllMusic critic Tim Sendra claimed that the song reveals \\"a reflective side that was nowhere to be found on Boston\\". Paul Grein of Billboard commented on the song's \\"religious feel\\", describing it as \\"the softest cut on the album\\" and noting that \\"it may well be a strong single.\\" Grein also commented on the song's \\"moody organ solo\\" and \\"ponderous ballad sound\\". Pete Prown and Harvey P. Newquist described Scholz's guitar solo as long and dramatic. Ultimate Classic Rock critic Michael Gallucci described the song as \\"an introspective ballad\\", unlike the band's typical material. Rolling Stone critic Ken Emerson compared \\"A Man I'll Never Be\\" to Led Zeppelin's lengthy classic song \\"Stairway to Heaven\\". On Boston's official site, David Wild described the song as \\"a slowburning power ballad reflecting real grown-up concerns and lived-in reality\\". Craig Rosen of Billboard also described the song as a power ballad. Greil Marcus, writing in New West magazine, described the song's subject as \\"how hard it is to live up to a girl's image of a boy\\". Marcus cited the bravery of the lyrics, in which the singer acknowledges his inadequacy, and described the theme of the song as \\"the wimp redeemed\\". He further explained that the singer sounds \\"trivial\\" and \\"insufferable\\" at first, but as the guitars in the background build, he achieves a measure of glory in his suffering with the lines \\"You look up at me/And somewhere in your mind you see/A man I’ll never be\\". Marcus concluded that although the singer never achieves the peace of mind he is seeking, \\"he is allowed a sense of self, of justification, and one comes away convinced that existence, no matter how miserable, is not meaningless\\". Emerson similarly saw the theme of the song to be apprehension \\"with failing to be a man.\\" He noted that the lyrics sometimes contradict the lyrics of other songs on Don't Look Back. For example, a line in the title track says \\"I'm much too strong not to compromise\\", but one from \\"A Man I'll Never Be\\" says \\"I can't get any stronger\\". \\"A Man I'll Never Be\\" also has a line stating that \\"Emotions can't be satisfied\\", which contradicts the title of its follow-up single, \\"Feelin' Satisfied\\". Emerson concluded that the song \\"both distills and expands upon this knot of despair, which contrasts with the architectural magnificence of the song's musical accomplishments\\". Release \\"A Man I'll Never Be\\" was released in late 1978 as the follow-up single to \\"Don't Look Back,\\" which had reached No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100. The single did not perform as well as its predecessor, peaking at No. 31 in January 1979. It performed slightly better in Canada, peaking at No. 27. \\"A Man I'll Never Be\\" was later included on Boston's Greatest Hits (1997). Reception Marcus rated the song as one of three masterpieces on Don't Look Back, along with the title track and \\"Used to Bad News\\". Billboard similarly rated the song as one of the best cuts on Don't Look Back. Billboard called it \\"a slick ballad with searing guitars and Brad Delp's fluid lead vocal highlighting.\\" Gallucci and Craig each rated it as Boston's 10th greatest song. Los Angeles Times critic Jon Matsumoto called the song \\"a grandiose guilty pleasure\\". According to Paul Elliot, the song is a favorite of Def Leppard bass guitarist Rick Savage. On the other hand, Milo Miles of Boston Phoenix called it a long stretch \\"of immaculate self-abuse\\". Live performances Boston played \\"A Man I'll Never Be\\" live on the tour supporting their first album in 1977 before recording it for Don't Look Back. Delp played the keyboards for these performances. Ottawa Journal critic Mike Volsin stated that the song's slow melody showed that Boston \\"can settle into the slower mood without any difficulty\\". Referring to a live performance of the song prior to its release, Peter Robb stated that Delp's voice \\"stood out like a shining light\\". Cover versions DGM covered the song on their 2007 album Different Shapes. Extreme covered the song live. After Delp's death, Tommy DeCarlo used the tune to record a song \\"A Man I'll Always Be\\" as a tribute to Delp. That recording and several Boston covers he recorded separately led to his getting the job as Boston's new lead singer.

The Bank Policy Institute was formed in July 2018 by the merger of two older lobbying groups, the Financial Services Roundtable and the Clearing House Association. Former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty had been head of the Financial Services Roundtable; Clearing House Association president Greg Baer (formerly of JPMorgan Chase) remained and became head of the Bank Policy Institute. History In 1912, the Association of Reserve City Bankers was formed, with 102 charter members. In 1958, the Association of Registered Bank Holding Companies was formed, in response to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. In 1993, these two entities merged to form the Bankers Roundtable. In 2000, the name of the organization was changed to the Financial Services Roundtable, to reflect a decision to broaden the organization's mission to include representing integrated financial service providers. In July 2018, Financial Services Roundtable merged with the Clearing House Association to form the Bank Policy Institute. Parts  In 1996, the newly-created BITS (Business Innovation Technology and Security division) under the former Bankers Roundtable, allowed collaboration on technological issues faced by the financial services industry.

Another part of the Roundtable, the Bankruptcy Coalition, lobbied for changes to the bankruptcy code in 2005. There are numerous other parts of the Roundtable. One part, Agents for Change, was described as helping move forward the \\"modernization\\" of insurance regulation. Another part tries to officially improve working communities of the financial services industry and creating partnerships with non-profits and politicians. The Housing Policy Council and 34 member companies, another part of the Roundtable are engaged in an \\"effort to prevent foreclosures and preserve homeownership.\\" In addition to these sections of the Roundtable, there are three initiatives pushed: InFact (provide Americans with \\"information...important to the financial services industry), ITAC (non-profit that fights identity theft) and www.MyMoneyManagement.net (providing consumers with \\"financial education\\").

Most of the revenue (65%) coming into the Roundtable was from membership dues of participating organizations. Lobbying Lobbying has always been a focus of the Roundtable. From 1998 to 2000, less than a million dollars was spent on lobbying. But, by 2001 after the creation of the Roundtable, more than $1.1 million was spent. For the next five years, the amount of money spent on lobbying increased. In 2006, less than $6.2 million was spent on lobbying. The next two years, more money was spent on lobbying than in 2006: $6,380,000 was spent in 2007, and $7,760,000 was spent in 2008. The next year, the Roundtable spent about $6.9 million on lobbying in Washington, DC with more than $900,000 going to outside lobbying firms. The Center of Responsive Politics showed a continuation of this trend. From 2008 to 2011, an average of about $7.5 million was spent on lobbying each year. A good number of lobbyists representing the Roundtable have been involved in the revolving door between industry and government. Nine of them are part of the revolving door and one is a former congressman. Political contributions Even before its founding, the money contributed toward federal candidates has been spent. The Center for Responsive Politics notes that in the election cycles of 1990, 1992, 1994, 1996, and 1998, less than $90,000 was spent each year, with the highest amount in 1992 with about $85,200 spent. However, in the 2000s, the amount spent went up exponentially. An upward tick in the amount spent reached a high of $615,808 in the 2010 election cycle. Even with this increase, the money spent in the 2012 election cycle dropped almost by half. The money spent from the 1990s to the present has not been given to just one party, but to both major parties in Washington, Democrats and Republicans. In the three election cycles from 1990 to 1994, Democrats were given more money than Republicans. In the late 1990s, that changed with more money being given to Republicans than Democrats (1996 and 1998 election cycles). This only increased in the 2000s, with more contributions being given than ever before, with a height of more than $266,200 given to Republican Party candidates in the 2008 election cycle. Still, Democrats were the runner-up, and were given the highest amount of money in the same election cycle: more than $214,400. In the 2012 election cycle, $46,000 went to House Democrats, $122,000 to House Republicans and $36,500 to Senate Democrats and $38,000 to Senate Republicans. Such recipients include Speaker of the House John Boehner, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, Maryland Congressman Steny Hoyer, Congressional Progressive Caucus member Xavier Becerra, senior Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Senate Majority Whip Jon Kyl and many others.

The team was founded as Inception Motorsports which fielded a single No. 30 team in the Cup Series in 2011 and 2012 before being purchased by Swan Energy CEO Brandon Davis late in 2012. The team was headquartered in Mooresville, North Carolina in the United States. David Stremme was the team's original driver, before being replaced by rookies Cole Whitt and Parker Kligerman at the end of 2013. The team expanded to two teams in 2014 for Whitt and Kilgerman, attempting and qualifying for every event that season until the woes of sponsorship kicked in following the eighth race of the season. The team shut down in April 2014; its owners points, employees, and most of its assets moved to Xxxtreme Motorsport and BK Racing, though Parker Kligerman remained under contract through year's end.  Team history  The team was established as Inception Motorsports in April 2011 in Mooresville, North Carolina by Inception Investment Group CEO Timothy McSweeney with David Stremme as the driver of the No. 30. The following year, Inception Motorsports switched from Chevrolet to Toyota. Before the 2012 Talladega fall race, McSweeney sold the team to 33-year-old Brandon Davis, a racing enthusiast and CEO of independent petroleum company Swan Energy. Davis vowed to change the team's reputation as a start and park entry, and instead run full races. The team utilized engines from Triad Racing Technologies, hired former crew chief Steve Hmiel to be the competition director, and switched names to Swan Racing Company (Swan Racing for short). On January 31, 2013, former NFL linebacker Bill Romanowski became a minority owner of Swan Racing. His health supplement company, Nutrition53 (Romanowski wore the No. 53 during his 16-year playing career) was a primary sponsor for ten races and an associate sponsor for the remaining 26. Prior to the fall race at Richmond in 2013, the team announced that it was releasing driver David Stremme following that weekend's event, and planned to run several young drivers in preparation for the 2014 season. The move blindsided Stremme, who had helped found the team out of his own race shop and was integral in Davis' purchase of the organization in 2012. Stremme also held a profit stake in the team, though it had yet to make a profit. On December 3, 2013, the team announced that Cole Whitt and Parker Kligerman would compete for Rookie of the Year honors for them in 2014, as the team expanded to two full-time cars with the No. 26 and No. 30. On January 13, 2014, Anthony Marlowe from Iowa City Capital Partners was announced as a minority owner. On February 4, 2014, it was announced that rapper 50 Cent's headset company SMS Audio will serve as Swan Racing's associate sponsor. On April 17, 2014, team officials announced that they would be reviewing the team's future due to lack sponsorship, though co-owner Anthony Marlowe stated he intended to run Whitt for the rest of the season. On April 23, the team announced it had sold off both entries, with Whitt, Marlowe, and the No. 26 entry moving under the BK Racing banner. The owners points of the No. 30 team were sold to Xxxtreme Motorsport, which fielded a No. 30 car at Richmond before switching to their usual No. 44. Swan Racing's shop in Statesville, North Carolina was also sold to Xxxtreme Motorsport. On July 10, 2018 former Swan Racing crew chief Steven Lane formed On Point Motorsports in the NASCAR Gander Outdoors Truck Series running the No. 30 as a reference to Swan, the team currently competes full-time in the truck series with driver Brennan Poole Car No. 26 history On February 13, 2013 NASCAR approved a temporary number change for the Daytona 500 to allow Swan Racing to compete using the number 26, as a charity effort in honor of the 26 who died during the Sandy Hook shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. Two-time Daytona 500 winner and fellow Toyota team owner Michael Waltrip drove the car, with regular driver David Stremme recruiting Waltrip to \\"further [the team's] relationship with Toyota.\\" Waltrip was also reunited with former Dale Earnhardt, Inc. crew chief Tony Eury Jr. Waltrip drive the car to a 22nd-place finish.Michael Waltrip To Honor Sandy Hook Victims In Daytona 500 The team ran the No. 30 for the rest of the year. On January 7, 2014, Swan Racing announced that their new second full-time team would be numbered 26. Former Red Bull Racing and JR Motorsports driver Cole Whitt was hired to drive the 26, after running seven late season races for the team in 2013. New investor Anthony Marlowe was listed as the owner. The car was sponsored by Speed Stick GEAR in the 2014 Daytona 500, and several other early-season races. Whitt qualified for each of the first eight races, and recorded a single top-20 (at Auto Club Speedway). After Darlington, he No. 26 team was sold to former Swan Racing minority partner Anthony Marlowe, who in turn merged his ownership of the team with BK Racing. Car No. 30 history The team's 2011 car under Inception Motorsports The No. 30 team made its debut in the 2011 Crown Royal 400 at Richmond International Raceway with David Stremme as the driver, qualifying 16th in their first attempt at competition. Steve Lane was the crew chief. Throughout the season, the team attempted 18 races, but failed to qualify for five, including the 2011 Brickyard 400. Inception Motorsports finished 43rd in the 2011 Sprint Cup Series team owners' standings. For the 2012 Sprint Cup Series season, the team ran the full 36 race schedule with Stremme driving in all races except the two road course races, where Brian Simo and Patrick Long drove respectively. They made the field on qualifying speeds for the 2012 Daytona 500, taking the third of three guaranteed starting positions for teams not in the top 35 in owner points. The team later acquired the 2011 owners' points from the defunct TRG Motorsports No. 71 team, which had finished 36th in the owner standings and shut down at the end of 2012. The team qualified for each of the first six races of the season, with a best finish of 28th at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, before failing to qualify for the season's seventh race at Texas Motor Speedway. Having failed to reach the top 35 in owners points, the team began to start and park due to a lack of sponsorship, eventually parking in 20 out of 28 races. The team did finish six races and its best 2012 finish was 24th at Indianapolis. The team's 2013 car at Richmond International Raceway Following Michael Waltrip's run in the 2013 Daytona 500, Stremme returned to drive for the newly rechristened Swan Racing, with Tony Eury Jr. taking over crew chief duties for the team. The team only recorded four top 20s in the first 26 races. Stremme was released following the September race at Richmond International Raceway, being replaced by Cole Whitt for four races. Whitt finished 39th at Chicagoland Speedway. Four-time Chili Bowl Midget Nationals winner Kevin Swindell ran the No. 30 at New Hampshire Motor Speedway with local sponsor Genny Light, finishing 38th after an accident. Whitt wound up running seven races for the team, while Parker Kligerman started two races at Texas and Homestead-Miami, with sold finishes of 18th and 25th respectively. Overall, the team had five DNF's all season and failed to reach the halfway point of a race only once, when Whitt crashed at Phoenix in November. On January 7, 2014, Parker Kligerman, a former development driver for Team Penske and Kyle Busch Motorsports, was confirmed as the driver of the No. 30 for 2014. Unfortunately, Kligerman struggled mightily through eight races, with a best finish of 29th at Daytona, where he crashed out of the race on Lap 193. He also failed to finish at Phoenix (engine), Auto Club (crash), and Texas (radiator), suffered a non-terminal electronic fuel injection problem at Las Vegas and a first lap wreck at Martinsville. The owners points of the No. 30 were later sold to Xxxtreme Motorsport with driver J. J. Yeley due to Swan's financial struggles, with the No. 30 crew following. However, Kligerman continued to remain under contract.

Although the South African cabinet had assented to the passage of His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936 by the Parliament of the United Kingdom at the time of the abdication in December 1936, the South African act was passed in February 1937 to resolve legal uncertainties. The Statute of Westminster 1931 gave the dominions, including the Union of South Africa, full legislative independence from the United Kingdom, and provided that no act of the British Parliament would apply in a dominion unless the dominion requested and consented that it do so. The preamble of the statute also stated that any changes to the succession to the throne would require the assent of the parliaments of all of the dominions. After Edward signed the Instrument of Abdication on 10 December 1936, the British government communicated with the Dominion governments, who agreed to the passage of the Abdication Act by the British Parliament. Only the Canadian government formally \\"requested and consented\\", however, while the Australian, New Zealand and South African governments merely \\"assented\\" to the legislation. The legal position in South Africa was further complicated by the provisions of the Status of the Union Act, 1934. Section two of that act provided that no act of the British parliament would apply in South Africa without an act of the South African parliament making it applicable; this was a stricter requirement than the \\"request and consent\\" requirement of the Statute of Westminster. On the other hand, section five of the Status of the Union Act defined the succession to the throne by reference to the law of succession applicable in the United Kingdom. To resolve this confusion, the South African parliament enacted in February 1937 its own Abdication Act. It contained the same provisions as the British act, declaring the accession of George VI to the throne, excluding Edward VIII and his descendants from any right to the throne, and excluding them from the provisions of the Royal Marriages Act. However, the South African act declared the abdication and accession to have occurred on 10 December when Edward signed the Instrument of Abdication, rather than 11 December when the Abdication Act had come into force in the UK. It also declared that actions taken in the name of Edward VIII after the abdication but before the passage of the South African act were deemed to be valid. The act was repealed by the South African Constitution of 1961 when South Africa became a republic.

Silverwood was set up in 1965 to preserve coastal chaparral and riparian woodland habitats. It is also a nature education facility for San Diego area schoolchildren and adults, and functions as part of a wildlife migration corridor. Geography  The Silverwood Wildlife Sanctuary is located in Lakeside, California, USA, about 20 miles northeast of the city of San Diego. Its geographic coordinates are 116.88 degrees west longitude and 32.92 degrees north latitude. The topography consists of gentle to steep slopes, ranging in elevation from about 1,500 feet to 3,177 feet. There are frequent granitic boulder outcrops, and two seasonal streams. History The first 85 acres of Silverwood were donated to the San Diego Audubon Society by Society member Harry Woodward in 1965.Silverwood Offers Excellent Education  Utsandiego.Com Mobile Since then a resident naturalist and manager has lived on the site; the first was botanist Frank F. Gander (1899–1976). In 2013 it has grown through acquisitions to 757 acres, one hundred of which were lands transferred to SDAS from the federal Bureau of Land Management. The sanctuary is operated by a standing committee of the SDAS. Artifacts found in the Sanctuary indicate that Kumeyaay Indians have lived in and around the site for thousands of years. Immediately north of Silverwood is the Barona Indian Reservation. Biological importance Silverwood is located in a chaparral biological community. It is maintained as a pristine example of this habitat which is in decline in Southern California. As of 2013, 340 species of plants have been recorded on the Sanctuary.Silverwood: Audubon Society's Sanctuary in S.D. : 'As undisturbed a place as you can find . . . where you can get out and see the plants and wildlife.' - Los Angeles Times Silverwood served as a research area for the San Diego Natural History Museum’s book on the Flora of San Diego County. Along the two wet-season streams on the Sanctuary are riparian woodlands and a small cienega (seasonal wetland), which provide botanical diversity to the sanctuary. Mammals observed in the Silverwood Sanctuary include Bobcat, Mountain Lion, Ringtail, Coyote, Merriam Chipmunk, Mule Deer, Gray Fox, and some smaller mammals. About 160 species of birds have been recorded, and many nest there; the sanctuary is a popular bird-watching area. Reptiles include the threatened San Diego Horned Lizard and rare Lyre and Night snakes. Many species of both flora and fauna are designated as threatened, rare, or declining. Three naturalists who researched at Silverwood,Frank F. Gander (1899–1976), Dr. Gerald Cosgrove and Dr. Andrew Olson, have had species of flora and fauna named for them, including Cylindropuntia ganderi, Lepechinia ganderi, Cryptantha ganderi, Caligus olsoni, Leuresthicola olsoni, Thaumameris cosgrovei.

Fire-following birds such as Lazuli Bunting and Black-chinned Sparrow also soon arrived. By 2008, the various natural habitats at Silverwood had completely regenerated themselves following the fire.New Life After Fires At Silverwood Wildlife Sanctuary  East County Magazine Nature education Nature education, especially for schoolchildren, has been a major function of Silverwood since its creation in 1965. Silverwood is open to the public at no charge, with free nature education hikes offered every Sunday.Take a Sunday tour of the Audubon Society's Silverwood Wildlife Sanctuary near Lakeside.  San Diego Reader In 2011, a fourth-grade nature education program was begun in cooperation with several of the local school districts. Except for the period immediately after the 2003 Cedar Fire, thousands of County residents have visited the Sanctuary every year to participate in its nature education programs. A nature trail network of more than four miles (6.4 km) has been created at Silverwood. Two of the trails are marked with plant identification signs, and there is also a short ethnobotany trail, showing how various plants were used by Native Americans for food and medicinal purposes. Several of the trails include panoramic views. The Frank Gander Nature Education Center contains flora and fauna displays, historical items, a reference library, and a collection of taxidermied wildlife.

She is an associate professor in the Department of Teaching, Learning and Sociocultural Studies at the University of Arizona. She is also a member of the National Association of Chicana/o Studies, the American Educational Research Association, and the American Anthropological Association. Her research looks at the embodied practices of resistance in homeless LGBT youth communities, violence and youth, problems in testimonio methods, and the school-to-prison pipeline. She is also interested in decolonial feminist theory, community-based learning, race and schooling, and U.S. Third World feminism.  Education  Cindy Cruz received her bachelor's degree in literature at Scripps College in Claremont, California. She attained her master's degree and Ph.D. in education in 2006 at the University of California, Los Angeles.  Contributions to the field  Cruz's work focuses on the embodied practices of resistance that queer youth of color utilize. She outlines the forms of new identities that are emerging among lesbian and gay youth of color through practices/praxical thinking that is grounded in the writing and theorizing of women of color. From these ideas Cruz developed the concept of an “epistemology of a brown body” which acknowledges the multiple and often oppositional intersections of sociopolitical locations that the brown body appropriates and negotiates. “For the educational researcher, understanding the brown body and the regulation of its movements is fundamental in the reclamation of narrative and the development of radical projects of transformation and liberation.” In her article “Toward an Epistemology of a Brown Body” she focuses her writing on her experiences as a Chicana lesbian. ::“I had always thought that among my endless number of relatives I had the only queer story to tell. No matter about the one in ten statistic for lesbians and gay men (homosexuals make up at least 10 percent of the population), I could not even imagine there was another lesbiana in our family until the day of my grandmother’s funeral.” Other Chicana/Latina and African American feminists that frame their work in the form of lived experiences are Audre Lorde, Chela Sandoval, M. Jacqui Alexander, Maria Lugones, Gloria Anzaldúa, Cherrie Moraga, and the Combahee River Collective, who have strongly influenced Cruz's work.  LGBTQ youth and forms of resistance  Another area of study that Cruz focuses on is in the forms of resistance enacted by homeless LGBTQ youth. In her journey of understanding the brown body she centralizes her research in testimonio methodologies and critical ethnographic practice. “In my ethnography of LGBTQ street youth, I learned to read the subtle signs of their identities – the small rainbow bracelets, the body language between students, a movement of the hands, the coded languages – wherein the body became a sign.”  Publications  In “LGBTQ Street Youth Talk Back: A Meditation on Resistance and Witnessing”, Cindy Cruz argues that, \\"despite the regulation and containment of their bodies, queer street youth consistently create spaces of resistance that move them away from the tropes of infection, contamination, and deservedness that are inscripted onto the bodies of queer youth\\". Following the parallels of the work by feminist philosopher Maria Lugones, this essay integrates a framework for resistance researchers with the traditional sense of social research. In other words, it may be seen as an alternative perspective from the researcher, where the researcher becomes inundated in the environment as a witness, rather than an \\"other\\". Cruz elaborates that \\"the tropes of contamination and irresponsibility intersect many of the experiences of LGBTQ street youth in ways that implicate not only LGBTQ street youth, but also other marginalized bodies\\". In that, Cruz suggests that intersections of poverty and race give way to new dimensions of marginalization, which are exclusive not only to LGBTQ street youth. Cindy Cruz’ “Notes on Immigration, Youth, and Ethnographic Silence”, published in the journal “Theory into Practice”, \\"is a two-year ethnography of a public school that serves LGBTQ young people\\". Cruz advocates that teachers create safe spaces in schools where they may recognize ethnographic silence and omitted dialogue. By doing so, Cruz argues that such safe space will allow for LGBTQ migrants students, as well as other marginalized students, to feel comfortable about expressing and confronting their identities without negative social consequences. Such publication serves to challenge the traditional sense of the classroom into a space that may foster students in relation to their construction of self. In “The Locker Room : Eroticism and Exoticism in a Polyphonic Text”, Cindy Cruz \\"collaborates with Greg Tanaka to inject story-telling into legal scholarship in order to deconstruct and then reconstruct knowledge\\". The authors encourage education researchers to steer away from methodologies and systems of analysis that are rooted on white liberal discourse, which serve to uphold the status-quo. This publication utilizes polyphonic dialogue in the first half, then transitions into an analytic discussion of the polyphonic dialogue to decipher and reconstruct the matter of knowledge. This process exercised by the authors allows one to identify multiple identities through the dialogue as relative to one another. In “Toward an epistemology of a brown body” from the “International Journal of Qualitative Studies in Education”, Cindy Cruz examines how \\"the absence and elusiveness of the body in educational research defines and delineates any consideration of how new identities, particularly the emerging identities of Latina/o lesbian and gay youth, are being invented within a contestation of dominant discourses of race, class, gender, and sexuality\\". By reevaluating the writings of Chicana theorists Cherrie Moraga and Gloria Anzaldúa, Cruz determines the brown body as the required central role in the negotiation of multiple, and often conflicting, ideas and identities. To create new knowledge, Cruz deems it imperative to maintain the brown body in centrality when compromising for identity at an intersection of sociopolitical and ethnic roles. This publication is unique in that it implicitly prioritizes the appearance of ethnicity as a starting point in the search for one's construction of identity.  Awards  Cindy Cruz's contributions to the field have been of great benefit to the research in many different fields for example, Chicano/a Studies, Queer Studies, Education, Feminism, and other interdisciplinary fields. Her work has been recognized through several prestigious awards. More specifically her article “LGBTQ Street Youth Talk Back: A Meditation on Resistance and Witnessing” has earned her two important awards in 2012. One of the awards was for Article of the Year from the American Educational Research Association (AERA) through the Queer Studies Special Interest Group. She also received the Antonia I. Casteneda Prize from the National Association of Chicana and Chicano Studies (NACCS).  Activism  Along with other UCSC professors, Cindy Cruz has demonstrated substantial support for student-led, non-violent protests on the UCSC campus. The UCSC General Assembly, a general strike led by students to restore state funding to the UC system, took place on March 1, 2012 and effectively shut down both main entrances to the University of California, Santa Cruz. Following initial reports of protesters carrying clubs and knives, smashing a car windshield with a metal pipe, denying a resident of faculty/student housing the right to exit the campus, and keeping a campus health care worker from getting to work, several UCSC professors, including Cindy Cruz, responded to the initial reports by asserting that clubs, metal pipes and knives were nowhere to be seen at either entrance to the campus. Also, they contested that residents of faculty/student housing were indeed allowed access through the demonstration which shut-down the entrances. In addition, they applauded the efforts made by the students involved to organize and educate themselves and others about the state of the California budget and the increasing privatization of the UC system and public education in California. Additionally, many UCSC professors, including Cindy Cruz, wrote a \\"UCSC Faculty Letter of Solidarity\\" to exemplify their support for the UCSC General Assembly. In their letter, they cite the UCSC General Assembly as a protest which correlates with national and global movements against inequality and privatization of public resources. The faculty also called on the UC to re-affirm its commitment to serve the public good, to reset its priorities to put students first, to reverse the growth in administration and foster instruction and research, and, by taking all of these actions, to restore its role as the university of the people of California.

Rudy Buttignol works from within the Canadian media system to improve and protect it. He has published criticisms of the governance of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.[17][18][19]. Buttignol has moved beyond policy on public broadcasting to Canadian federal policy governing the cultural industries. He has raised the alarm about the gradual dismantling of the Canadian media industry in the face of ever-increasing dominance by a handful of powerful American corporations. Buttignol has gone on the record against the Silicon Valley Internet giants (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, and especially Netflix) being allowed to operate in Canada, and other countries, free from regulation and taxation. https://calgaryherald.com/opinion/columnists/daphne+bramham+knowledge+antidote+perils/15019534/story.html http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/netflix-investment- canada-1.4312716 https://nationalpost.com/entertainment/in-the-era-of-netflix- what-do-we-want-canadian-content-to- behttp://povmagazine.com/articles/view/netflix-sets-its-own-rules From 1975 to 1993, Buttignol worked as an independent filmmaker creating film and video works.

Only two generations of the family are known. In 1194 the family helped found the Cisterian St. Urban's Abbey. The family became extinct in the early 13th century, though much of their land was inherited by the Grünenbergs. History The House of Langenstein had their family seat on the Grünenberg Castle hill above the village of Melchnau. Archeological digs on the site have found evidence of a 10th or 11th century wooden castle, below later stone castles. This wooden castle was the first High Medieval fortification on the hill.Jufer 1999: pg. 55 (the site was originally dated from the 9th or 10th century, though this was later found to be too early). The name of the family likely came from the long stony crest of the hill and may have originally been langer Stein or long stone in English. The family owned land in the Rot (a tributary of the Murg river) and Langete river valleys. The family may have settled in the valley to begin colonizing the empty forest between the County of Burgundy in the west and the Alamannia territories in the east.Jufer 1999: pg. 41. The first time the Langenstein family appears, is in an unconfirmed record from 1148, when they supposedly founded an Augustinian Canons Regular.Haeberle 1964: p.32 First generation The first recorded generation of the Langenstein family consisted of five siblings; Ulrich the knight, the two clergymen Lütold and Werner I. and two sisters Willebirk (Willbirgis) and Adelheid. Ulrich was mentioned in 1191 as the owner of a church in Rot, now in the hamlet of Chlyrot in Untersteckholz. His brothers were both clergymen at that church, Werner I was the head of the canons and Lütold was the priest. Ulrich's wife was Mechtild, the widow of Baron Werner II of Signau, who died in 1178. Willebirk (mentioned 1197) was married to the Baron and Knight Arnold of Kapfenberg (who was mentioned in 1200). Her sister, Adelheid (mentioned 1197-1239) had Baron Burkhard of Balm (mentioned by 1201) for a husband. Between 1191-1194 the three Langenstein brothers founded a Cistercian monastery. Diethelm of Krenkingen, Bishop of Constance, confirmed the donation and that it was accepted by the General Chapter of the Order at Citeaux in 1194. The mother monastery, Lützel Abbey, sent twelve monks under the Abbot Konrad to establish an Abbey on the Langenstein lands. However, the first location in the Rot valley proved inadequate and in 1195, the monks moved about down the valley to establish St. Urban's Abbey. Second generation Baron Ulrich died in 1212. He left several children, including a daughter, Anna (1197–1224) and two sons, Werner II (mentioned before 1212-1214) and Heinrich (first mentioned before 1212 and died after 1234). The existence of another son named Cuno is uncertain.Genealogical Notes of the Lucerne city clerk Renward Cysat. Pluss 1900, p 9, note 6 Ulrich's daughter Anna is probably the wife of the knight Ulrich I (mentioned from before 1218 to before 1224) from the highly respected family of Grünenberg. The majority of the Langenstein descendants had already founded their own families, such as the Balm family, a generation before. Therefore, Anna became the primary heiress to the Langenstein lands. With her marriage to Ulrich of Grünenberg, she brought the Langenstein lands into the Grünenberg family. Anna died seven days after the death of her husband, but not before her and her sons made a large donation to the Abbey of St. Urban.Jufer 1994: p 128; Plüss 1900. pg. 7 During the second half of the 13th century, another member of the Langenstein family, Iddah of Langenstein and her husband Heinz of Luternau were involved in a bloody struggle for supremacy in the market town of Langenthal.Jufer 1994: p 134; Plüss 1900. P. 11, note 3 The bloody conflict, which devastated the Abbey of St. Urban, had the descendants of Iddah and Heinz fighting against the main branch of Langenstein descendants, Heinrich II and Markwart I of Grünenberg. Coat of arms There are several different versions of the insignia of the Barons of Langenstein. One appears only in the 14th century and features a pacing red lion on a transversely divided blue-white field. From in Tschudis Wappenbuch, Pluss after 1900. Page 5, footnote 2 In the Zurich Wappenrolle it is completely different; Argent, an eagle gules charged on its tail with a crown azure.Streifen II, Vorderseite 10, the coat of arms LANGENSTAIN (Langenstein) accessed 11 June 2012Zurich Roll accessed 11 June 2012 Reichenau ministeriales The Barons of Langenstein are not to be confused with the Ministerialis (unfree knights in the service of a feudal overlord) family of Langenstein, who were in the service of Reichenau Abbey. This family consisted of Arnold I of Langenstein (mentioned 1271 and 1272) and his sons Hugo the Younger (mentioned before 1271 and after 1298), Berthold, Arnold and Frederick II. In 1271, they granted the island of Mainau, which they were holding as a fief for the Abbey, to the Teutonic Order. In 1272, the Order established a Commandry and allowed Hugo and another of his brothers to live there. Hugo was a Middle High German poet and he wrote an extensive poem about the life and martyrdom of Martina of Rome. This family took their name from Langenstein Castle in Hegau in southern Germany.

With his \\"Modell 370\\" (1987) he introduced the world's largest piano. In 2012, a digital version of the Modell 370 was published as a software instrument under the name \\"The Giant\\".  Life  In 1945, David Klavins's parents, Paulis and Zeltite, arrived as refugees from Latvia in Germany. David is the third of eight children. His mother played the piano and his father was a violinist. After finishing middle school in 1971, David Klavins started an apprenticeship as a piano maker at the Wilhelm Schimmel Pianofortefabrik in Braunschweig. In 1976, he started his own business, the \\"Klavierhaus Klavins\\" in Bonn. He mainly restored and sold used home and grand pianos. In 1980, he became a master craftsman, which, in Germany, meant that he could officially train apprentices.  Modell 370  David Klavins's two-floor-tall piano \\"Modell 370\\". Detail of Modell 370, top floor. While restoring and studying the architecture of grand pianos, Klavins became a critic of the traditional way to construct these instruments.The Organ, Musical Opinion, 1990, p. 199-202 He stated that the materials used in common piano making are outdated and don't reflect the current status of materials science. With this in mind, Klavins designed a piano with a size, shape and interior construction based on modern knowledge of acoustics – rather than the historical construction guidelines used in traditional piano making. In November 1987, he presented the \\"Klavins Klavier Modell 370\\" to the public in the German city of Bonn. It had its name from its height: 370 centimetres. In contrast to horizontally built grand pianos, the Modell 370 is laid out vertically. It weighs two tons and stretches over two floors. The piano player sits on the bench in the top floor, while the main part of the strings and the resonance body continue below his feet. Due to this construction, the sounding board, responsible for the acoustic breadth of the instrument, is of double size of an ordinary concert grand piano. This leads to a rich sound and a larger spectrum of overtones. The lowest bass string is 3.03 meters long – about three times longer than in a standard piano.Edwin M. Good: Giraffes, Black Dragons, and Other Pianos: A Technological History from Cristofori to the Modern Concert Grand. Stanford University Press 2002, p. 306. James Parakilas: Piano Roles: A New History of the Piano. Yale University Press, 2002, p. 57. As of 2012, the Modell 370 is the largest piano worldwide. The instrument was first played to the public by the classical pianist Cyprien Katsaris. Today it is stored in the Pfleghofsaal of the Institute Of Music Science, University of Tübingen. Klavins never intended to produce the instrument in series. Many pianists asked Klavins for a (horizontally built) grand piano with his construction technique. This led to the \\"Modell 408\\", which was scheduled to enter production in the summer of 2014. In May 2012, the Berlin music software developer Native Instruments introduced the Modell 370 as a software instrument, sampled by Uli Baronowsky, under the name \\"The Giant\\".http://www.native- instruments.com/en/products/komplete/keys/the-giant/  Una Corda  Klavins tunes his Una Corda piano On June 7, 2014, working closely with Nils Frahm, the Una Corda piano was released. The construction was inspired by building a portable upright piano similar to Model 370, which features an open design with no cabinet, and 64 individually stringed keys, altogether weighing at 100 kg. This further led to a live showcase on June 10, 2014 with Nils Frahm in Michelberger Hotel, Berlin.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R49faHgWW9w On December 12, 2015, Uli Baronowsky and Galaxy Instruments collaborated with Native Instruments releasing a fully realized virtual instrument that closely captures the original Una Corda.http://www.native- instruments.com/en/products/komplete/keys/una-corda/  Music label  In order to publish music played on the Modell 370, David Klavins, in 1988, founded his own record label, \\"Klavins Music\\", which was later bought by \\"Elite Music\\" in Taiwan and BMG-Asia. Among the concert pianists performing on that label were Michael Ponti, Thomas Duis, Joachim Arnold, Gülsin Onay, Michael Denhoff, Simon Nabatov and Wadik Polyonow.  Years of travel  In 1988 David Klavins moved to Latvia, the birth country of his parents, and worked in politics. In July 2006 he traveled to Orange County, California, where he entered into a partnership with Liana Marie Sive, to pursue his piano research. In August 2006 Sive and Klavins moved their research operations to Woodbridge, Connecticut. In October 2007 Sive and Klavins formally organized their research activities as PianoTectonics, Inc. Mr. Klavins was appointed Chief Operating Officer of the company, and for the next three years he engaged in intensive research that led to the development, among other things, of the technology for the Una Corda and M450 pianos. In 2011 he moved to Balingen, Germany and since late 2016 has resided in Vác, Hungary.

The badaud is an important urban type from 18th and 19th-century French literature, one that has been adapted to explain aspects of mass culture and modern experience. The term badaud (plural, badauds) comes from the French and has the basic meaning of \\"gawker\\", or more neutrally, \\"bystander\\". The term usually carries the connotation of idle curiosity, gullibility, simpleminded foolishness and gaping ignorance. It was an old inheritance, but was elaborated as an urban type in the eighteenth and nineteenth century to describe the street crowds that were an essential feature of the Parisian landscape. Like the flâneur, to which it has been frequently contrasted, the badaud has been construed as an emblematic figure of the modern, urban experience and of mass culture. The term badauderie (though not frequently used) refers to the act of gathering in a street crowd or gawking. Origins & Definition Badaud was in usage from the 16th century, if not earlier, a French adaptation of the old Provençal \\"badau\\". From the beginning the term described frivolous curiosity and ignorance. The Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe siècle (1867) defined the term in this way: \\"The badaud is curious; he is astonished by everything he sees; he believes everything he hears, and he shows his contentment or his surprise by his open, gaping mouth.\\"Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXème siècle, s.v. \\"badaud\\" (1867) The term came frequently to describe the crowds that gathered in the street at any remarkable sight. From the 17th century and after, the term was associated with Parisians. It is most frequently rendered in English as \\"gawker\\" or \\"bystander\\". Various Explanations of the Concept Antoine Furetière's Dictionnaire universel of 1690 defined the term and noted its association with Parisians. \\"It is an insulting nickname that has been given to the inhabitants of Paris, for they gather and amuse themselves to see and admire everything they find in their path, provided that it seems out of the ordinary\\".Antoine Fureitère, Dictionnaire universel (1690) Half a century later, Voltaire wrote: \\"If the people of Paris are most readily described as badauds, it is only because there are more people in Paris than elsewhere, and consequently more useless people. They gather at the first unfamiliar sight, to contemplate a charlatan, or two women of the people arguing, or a driver whose cart has overturned... There are badauds everywhere, but the first place has been given to those of Paris.\\"Voltaire, Dictionnaire philosophique, s.v. \\"Badaud\\" (first published 1770), in Œuvres complètes de Voltaire, vol. 17 (1878), p. 527 Louis-Sébastien Mercier (in 1782) noted that Parisians were often described as \\"perfect badauds,\\" enraptured by any strange sight.Louis- Sébastien Mercier, Tableau de Paris (Amsterdam, 1782), vol. 1, p. 74f. He described a wide variety of crowds in the city of Paris. An early nineteenth- century observer of the city (V-J Etienne de Jouy) described badauderie as the one ineffable trait of the Parisian character. \\"In Paris, everything becomes an event: a train of wood being floated down the river, two coaches running into each other, a man dressed differently from others, an armored car, a dog fight, if they are noticed by two people, there will soon be a thousand, and the crowd will always grow, until some other circumstance, just as remarkable, pulls it away.\\"V.-J. Etienne de Jouy, L'Hermite de la Chaussée d'Antin, ou observations sur les moeurs et les usages parisiens au commencement du XIXe siècle vol. 1 (Paris, 1997; orig. 1815), p. 140. The Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe siècle (1867) shows the badaud at work. \\"One is constantly jostled by a crowd of individuals who leave their houses each morning to kill time in city squares, intersections and on the boulevards; they have ten hours to dispose of, and when they return home in the evening, they want to have something to recount: an accident, a poor devil who falls from a bus into the street or faints from hunger, an old dog drowned in the Seine, etc., etc.; and when one of these Tituses of the pavement has seen nothing, observed nothing, he cries: I have lost my day!\\" This misfortune, we are told, rarely happens. \\"For when the street has nothing to offer, the badaud always can rely on the Morgue, the Jardin des Plantes, the cemetery at Père La Chaise, and in a last resort, there are the street performers of the place de la Bastille, or the puppeteers of the Champs-Elysées.\\"Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXème siècle, s.v. \\"badaud\\" (1867) In his drawings and engravings from the 1890s, Félix Vallotton presented a taxonomy of Parisian street crowds, demonstrators, pedestrians, and bystanders.Félix Vallotton et al, Badauderies parisiennes. Les Rassemblements. Physiologie de la rue, (Paris, 1896). The Badaud and the Flâneur The badaud was often contrasted with the flâneur. Auguste de Lacroix, Les Français peints par eux-mêmes (The French Described By Themselves, 1842) explained: \\"The flâneur is to the badaud what the gourmet is to the glutton... The badaud walks for the sake of walking, is amused with everything, is captivated by everything indistinctly, laughs without reason and gazes without seeing.\\"Cited in Christopher Forth, Masculinity and the Dreyfus Affair, 107. Victor Fournel, in Ce qu'on voit dans les rues de Paris (What One Sees in the Streets of Paris, 1867), made the distinction perfectly clear. \\"The flâneur must not be confused with the badaud; a nuance should be observed here. […] The simple flâneur […] is always in full possession of his individuality. By contrast, the individuality of the badaud disappears, absorbed by the outside world, which ravishes him, which moves him to drunkenness and ecstasy. Under the influence of the spectacle that presents itself to him, the badaud becomes an impersonal creature; he is no longer a man, he is the public, he is the crowd.Victor Fournel, Ce qu'on voit dans les rues de Paris (Paris, 1867), 263. Walter Benjamin (following Fournel) contrasted the two figures: \\"In the flâneur, the joy of watching is triumphant. It can concentrate on observation; the result is the amateur detective. Or it can stagnate in the gaper; then the flâneur has turned into the badaud.\\"Walter Benjamin, The Paris of the Second Empire in Baudelaire, 62.

The facility’s mission is to make remote-sensing data accessible Its work is central to polar processes research including wetlands, glaciers, sea ice, climate change, permafrost, flooding and land cover such as changes in the Amazon rainforest. History The Alaska Satellite Facility began as a single-purpose receiving station known as the Alaska Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Facility located in the Geophysical Institute (GI) at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. The interest in space-borne SAR observations began in the U.S. with the success of the Seasat mission in 1978. (There is information below under \\"Data Center\\" about the facility's 2013 release of newly processed Seasat SAR data.) After Seasat’s premature demise, scientists from the federally funded Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Geophysical Institute developed the concept of a ground station in Fairbanks, Alaska, to receive data from foreign satellites. In 1986, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory requested and approved a quotation for the integration of a receiving ground station, the Alaska SAR Facility, at UAF. The Alaska SAR Facility was marked at a ribbon-cutting ceremony on April 24, 1991. Later that year, the facility began down-linking European Remote Sensing Satellite-1 (ERS-1) data. The expected data volume for the station was 45 minutes total from ERS-1, JERS-1 and RADARSAT. In the operations stage, data flow rapidly increased due to changing requirements from flight agencies and government sponsors, and storage of online data and demand for SAR data was expected to rapidly exceed capacity. The Satellite-Tracking Ground Station launched in 1990, and in 1994 a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between NASA and UAF formed the ASF Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC). The facility was renamed the Alaska Satellite Facility in 2003. The ASF DAAC is one of 12 DAACs funded by NASA to support earth observations from ground-based, in-situ, airborne, and space borne sensors. The ASF DAAC processes, distributes, and archives data products as assigned by NASA. The ASF DAAC archive now offers more than a dozen synthetic aperture radar (SAR) datasets. Tasking and missions have been added or deleted from the MOA when deemed appropriate by NASA program managers, Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) personnel, and ASF management. NASA, on behalf of the Canadian Space Agency, launched RADARSAT-1 in November 1995. At this point, ASF was handling data from the original three satellite missions that spurred the science community into envisioning this facility. The launch of ADEOS-1 resulted in ASF simultaneously supporting four active missions until the loss of the two Japanese missions (ADEOS-1 in 1996 and JERS-1 in 1998), and the deactivation of ERS-1 with the launch of ERS-2 in 1996. In November 2002, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) appointed UAF as agent for the data acquisition, processing, and distribution to support the Japanese Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) mission, which featured Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR). With the successful launch of ALOS in January 2006, ASF’s Americas ALOS Data Node (AADN) became operational in October that same year when the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) declared the ALOS mission operational. The satellite functioned for five years. Data center The ASF DAAC provides production, archiving and distribution to the scientific community of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data products and tools from active and past missions. The facility is one of 12 theme-based National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) earth science data centers in the nation known as NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs). The DAACs are major components of the Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS), which in turn is part of NASA’s Earth Science Data Systems Program. The Alaska Satellite Facility is the only DAAC that focuses on SAR. It is also the U.S. archive for Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B (a European Space Agency mission), European Remote Sensing Satellite 1 and 2 (ERS 1/ERS 2), the Japanese Earth Resources Satellite 1 (JERS 1), RADARSAT 1 and the Japanese Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) mission, which featured Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR). Due to the agreements with many of the foreign agencies involved, at first much of the foreign-source DAAC data was restricted distribution to NASA-approved scientists only. But in 2015, the ALOS PALSAR data became unrestricted, and the Sentinel-1 data is also unrestricted. In June 2013, the Alaska Satellite Facility released newly processed, 35-year-old data from the 1978 Seasat satellite mission. Before this release, only 20 percent of the Seasat SAR data had been processed digitally. Satellite-tracking ground station As a receiving station for satellite data, the facility now operates three antennas on behalf of NASA: two 11-meter S/X band antennas and one 9-meter S/X-band. The second antenna was installed in 1994, in anticipation of the launch of the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite-1 (ADEOS-1) by Japan. The second 11-meter antenna was installed in 1995 on University-owned land within walking distance from the Geophysical Institute, and the 9-meter antenna replaced the original ground- station antenna in 2017. The ground station's prime polar location in Fairbanks enables the facility to service high-inclination, polar-orbiting, Earth-imaging spacecraft. The systems operate 24 hours a day, 7 days per week. The facility has evolved over the past 20 years into a full-service station, providing telemetry downlink, uplink, command and two-way coherent tracking services as one of 15 major members of the international Near Earth Network, which is managed by NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. The facility processes, and distributes raw data from remote-sensing satellites, servicing NASA and foreign agency satellites in support of scientific and operational research and applications. GeoData center  The Alaska Satellite Facility managed the Geophysical Institute's GeoData Center for many years. In 2016, management of the center was transferred out of the Alaska Satellite Facility. Its new website is here.

Oil on canvas; 85 × 59 cm. Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin Lise with a parasol, 1867 In Summer (French: En été) is an 1868 oil-on-canvas painting by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, a portrait of Lise Tréhot aged about 20. The subject Tréhot was Renoir's companion from about 1866 to 1871. He painted her at least 23 times,Jiminez, Jill Berk (2013). Dictionary of Artists' Models. Routeledge. pp. 526-528. . including Lise with a parasol, painted in 1867, Renoir's first significant critical success which was admired at the Paris Salon in 1868. This success may have inspired Renoir to paint her again, this time in a more informal style. Description The painting measures by and is a half-length frontal portrait of a young woman, dressed informally, sitting on a chair beside a wall, possibly on a balcony, with greenery behind. The female figure is carefully finished, but the background is sketched out roughly with bold dashes of colour in broad brushstrokes suggesting sunlit foliage. A thin red hairband pulls her hair back from her face, with dark wavy tresses falling loosely over her shoulders and white bodice. The right strap of the bodice has fallen off her shoulder, creating a very deep neckline. She has a distant expression, gazing to the right of the viewer. Her bare arms lie in her lap, resting on a skirt with red and white stripes, with a few green leaves held in her right hand. The painting is signed \\"A. Renoir\\" on part of the chair to the lower left. Influences and style The painting takes inspiration from the Romantic paintings of Eugène Delacroix, particularly his 1823 painting Orphan Girl at the Cemetery in which the subject's bodice also hangs off on one shoulder, and also the Realist works of Gustave Courbet. It is an example of a transition in Renoir's style from more formal studio painting to a looser Impressionist style. It was exhibited at the Salon de Paris in 1869 under the title En été, étude, with the word \\"étude\\" (French for \\"study\\") added to deflect criticism of the loose, impressionistic style of the background, which was not as highly finished as a completed salon painting (or tableau), such as his 1867 painting of Lise with a parasol. Provenance It is not known who purchased the painting from Renoir, but it was acquired from an unnamed art dealer by the art critic Théodore Duret in March 1873, and was acquired by collector François Depeaux (1853-1920). It was auctioned in 1906, and acquired in 1907 by the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin using funds donated by Mathilde Kappel, wife of the banker Marcus Kappel.

The Li family belonged to the northwest military aristocracy prevalent during the Sui dynasty and claimed to be paternally descended from the Daoist founder Laozi (whose personal name was Li Dan or Li Er), the Han dynasty General Li Guang, and Western Liang ruler Li Gao. This family was known as the Longxi Li lineage (隴西李氏), which includes the Tang poet Li Bai. The Tang Emperors also had Xianbei maternal ancestry, from Emperor Gaozu of Tang's Xianbei mother Duchess Dugu. On the other hand it has also been suggested that evidence indicates a matrilineal Xianbei origin of this clan. Northern Zhou General Li Xian, who claimed to have the same ancestor as the imperial family of the Tang, was in fact of Xianbei origin. Genealogical records of the house seem to have been extensively modified during the rule of the Tang dynasty to conceal their Xianbei heritage. The Tang imperial family preserved many Xianbei customs. The Tang Imperial family was watched over by the Zongcheng si (宗正寺). Longxi Li were claimed by the Tang Emperors as their ancestors. The bigger Longxi Li lineage outside of the Tang Imperial family had prominent members like Li Jiongxiu, Li Yiyan, Li Kui (chancellor), Li Wei (Tang dynasty), Li Fengji, Li Zhongyan, Li Jing (general), Li Zhaode, and Li Bai. The Tang Imperial Longxi Li lineage also included sub lineages like the Guzang Li (姑臧李), from which Li Zhuanmei (李專美) came from, who served the Later Jin. During the Tang dynasty the Li family of Zhaojun (赵郡李氏), the Cui clan of Boling, the Cui clan of Qinghe, the Lu clan of Fanyang, the Zheng family of Xingyang (荥阳郑氏), the Wang family of Taiyuan (太原王氏), and the Li family of Longxi (隴西李氏) were the seven noble families between whom marriage was banned by law.f The Tang dynasty included in their imperial family the title of Kaghan of the Yenisei Kirghiz, because the Tang dynasty family asserted Li Guang as their ancestor, and one of Li Guang's grandsons, Li Ling, was asserted as ancestor by the Kaghan of the Yenisei Kirghiz. Some of the Tang dynasty Imperial family's cadet branches ended up in Fujian. The branch founded by Li Dan (李丹) became prominent during the Song dynasty, as did another founded by Li Fu (李富). Descendants of the Tang Emperors now live in Chengcun village near the Wuyi Mountains in Fujian. There were dukedoms (二王三恪) established for the offspring of the royal families of the Zhou dynasty, Sui dynasty, and Tang dynasty during the Later Jin (Five Dynasties). The Hu family of Xidi are descended from Hu Shiliang, from Wuyuan, who was a descendant of Hu Changyi, a son of Emperor Zhaozong of Tang who was adopted by the Wuyuan Hu family.

She was purportedly the granddaughter of Francisco Barreto, Portuguese governor of India. Isabel Barreto married Alvaro de Mendaña, Spanish navigator, patron of several expeditions to the Pacific Ocean, and European discoverer of the Solomon Islands and the Marquesas Islands. Life Isabel accompanied her spouse on his last expedition from Peru to the Pacific. In the Santa Cruz Islands, she replaced Mendaña and her brother, Lorenzo Barreto, as Adelantada and Governor after their death. She and the main pilot Pedro Fernández de Quirós arrived at Manila, in the Philippines, with the 100 survivors of the expedition in the only remaining ship (at the beginning 378 men and women in four ships), after a terrible voyage of twelve weeks from the settlement of Santa Cruz (Nendö). Doña Isabel was honoured in Manila, and Quirós was commended for his service; with both absolved of any responsibility for the results of the expedition. Isabel, accused of cruelty by the crew, demonstrated a strong personality with great leadership and great determination. She had an uncompromising attitude and managed to maintain severe discipline of the crew of tough and adventurous men, always willing to conspire and mutiny. She remarried to general Fernando de Castro, again crossing the Pacific Ocean to Mexico, and then settled in Buenos Aires, where they lived for several years, before returning to Peru. It is said that Isabel crossed the Atlantic Ocean for the last time to Spain to defend her rights over the Solomon Islands, because the King had granted the right to colonize the islands to Pedro Fernández de Quirós. She may be buried in Castrovirreyna (Peru) or in Galicia (Spain), in 1612.

The Snettisham Jeweller's Hoard is a collection of Romano-British jewellery and raw materials, found during the construction of a house in the Norfolk village of Snettisham in 1985. The hoard is thought to be the working stock of a jeweller, buried in a single clay pot around 155 AD. The finds include the working tip of a quartz burnishing tool (its handle has not survived), partially or fully completed items of jewellery, and raw materials: mainly silver coins, scrap silver items and silver ingots, but also six pieces of scrap gold, and many engraved gemstones to be set in rings. The presence of scrap gold and silver and absence of base metals indicates that the jeweller dealt mainly with high-status customers. The high pot in which the hoard was found is local grey-ware, spherical with relatively narrow opening and base, with a capacity of around . Some items – such as bracelets – had to be bent to fit through the opening. Within the pot were found: * 110 coins: 83 silver denarii and 27 bronze coins; 74 of the silver coins are from the third issue by Domitian (81–96 AD), one with a relatively high silver content. There are also some posthumous coins of the deified Empress Faustina I (dated to 154–155 AD) which give a terminus post quem for the burial of the hoard. The silver coins are probably raw materials; the bronze coins may be the jeweller's own petty cash. * 117 engraved carnelian gemstones, of which only 7 stones are mounted in finger rings. Most have simple wheel-cut intaglio engravings with symbols of good luck, including deities such as Fortuna, Bonus Eventus, and Ceres. Stylistic differences indicate that the gemstones were produced by at least three different engravers. * A variety of completed rings, illustrating the range of variation available to a provincial jeweller, some set with gems, but many snake-rings, with a snake's head stamped in low relief at either end of a silver ribbon which would then be bent into shape. * Snake-bracelets, like the snake-rings, produced by stamping with a hammer and dies. * Silver chain necklaces with crescent pendants and wheel clasps, possibly representing the moon and the sun. * Quartz burnishing tool; its handle has not survived, but traces of gold on the tool show that it was used to polish gold. * Two rare scraps of Roman linen, one attached to a coin and another to a ring. The silver finds were covered in a layer of silver chloride corrosion, and some items including copper were covered with green copper carbonate verdigris. The finds are held by the British Museum.

History=Origins Hjortholm Mill, a copper mill, was built at the site in 1650. The site was acquired by Frederick III in 1668, renaming it Frederiksdal (Frederick's Valley). The king had plans to build a large maison de plaisance in the grounds but died in 1670 and his son Christian V abandoned the project. Frederick IV ceded the estate to his sister, Princess Sophia Hedwig, who began the construction of a house on the land which for unknown reasons bore a striking resemblance with Ørholm Manor on the island of Funen, but it was never completed. The current house Johan Sigismund Schulin The town of Bagsværd was separated from the Frederiksdal estate in 1735, and in 1739 Frederiksdal was put at the disposal of Johan Sigismund Schulin, a close friend of the royal family who had been ennobled by the crown and received a number of prominent appointments since Christian VI's ascend to the throne in 1730. On 30 December 1743, Schulin was granted the property from the king as a New Year present. He charged royal architect Niels Eigtved with the design of a summer residence which was completed in 1747. Schulin was created Count in 1750 but died later that same year. Schulin's eldest son, Frederik Ludvig Schulin. was only two years old when his father died. The estate was therefore managed by his mother, Catarine Marie Schulin (née von Møsting), who carried out alterations on the building in 1752 and 1753 with the assistance of the architect Johann Gottfried Rosenberg. During her tenure the naturalist Otto Friedrich Müller made and published the observations of protists and flora found on the estate that made his reputation. She was later involved in a love affair with the exiled Swedish count Adolph Ribbing who later continued to Paris. Frederik Ludvig Schulin The grown-up Frederik Ludvig Schulin has been described as lazy, incompetent and dissolute and it has therefore been speculated that Frederiksdal only remained in the hands of the Schulin family as a result of his early death in 1781. Sophie Hedevig Schulin Frederik Ludvig Schulin's son, Sigismund Schulin, was only three years old when his father died. The Frederiksdal estate was therefore managed by his mother until 1808. Sigismund Schulin was intended for a career as a civil servant at the royal court in Copenhagen but it ended when he was accused of high treason in 1807-08. Architecture Christian Tilemann-Petersen: Guest room at Frederiksdal, 1925 The house seen from the garden Frederiksdal is credited with being the earliest example of a maison de plaisance in Denmark. It stands in white-dressed masonry with sandstone decorations above the windows and two corner risalits on the main facade. The house originally had a hipped roof while the mansard roof is the result of alterations carried out by Johann Gottfried Rosenberg between 1752 and 1753. The interior features a combination of large and small rooms symmetrically arranged around the main axis' vestibule and conservatory. There are rich Rococo stucco decorations, particularly in the Garden Hall, executed by Carlo Enrico Brenno and Giovanni- Battista Fossati. Frederiksdal today The property is currently owned by the seventh generation of the Schulin family. The main building plays host to an annual series of classical concerts. The estate covers 328 hectares of land of which circa 200 hectares are forest.

Vicinius, traditionally the first bishop of Sarsina, is supposed to have been a native of Liguria. Shortly before the great persecutions of Diocletian and Maximinus II, he withdrew as a hermit to a mountain about six kilometres from Sarsina which is now named after him (Monte San Vicinio, in the present commune of Mercato Saraceno). Here he followed a life of prayer and penitence. While the priests and people of Sarsina were assembled to choose a bishop, a divine sign appeared over the mountain top. In this way the solitary Vicinius was appointed bishop, from the beginning of the fourth century (about 303) to his death in 330. Even after his election Vicinius periodically withdrew to the mountains in solitary retreat. The Collar of Saint Vicinius During his life he had a reputation as a miracle-worker, with a particular ability to expel demons and to heal the faithful of physical and mental illness by means of an iron chain or collar weighted with a stone which he wore round his neck as a penance, in the form of two arms joined by a double clasp and terminating in two interlocking rings.Il collare di San Vicinio. La costituzione della catena According to a scientific study carried out by the University of Bologna, the collar, of uncertain origin, is either contemporary with or slightly earlier than the life of the saint. Today the collar is used for blessings. It is said to be the hand of the saint who by his powerful intercession with God gives grace to all those who make pilgrimage to his altar.San Vicinio. Collare di San Vicinio The exorcisms are carried out inside the basilica of San Vicinio (the former Sarsina Cathedral) by priests specially authorised by the bishop Cult In Sarsina Cathedral is the Chapel of Saint Vicinius. Here are kept the saint's relics and the miraculous collar, the reputation of which still brings pilgrims seeking the saint's aid in healing illness and possession. The feast of Saint Vicinius is celebrated on 28 August. NotesSources * Vita s.

The mural was painted over with silver paint before the fair opened, probably due to official objections, but other reasons have been suggested. Warhol and nine (originally ten) other artists were commissioned in 1962 to create works to decorate square spaces at the New York State Pavilion. The nine others were Peter Agostini, John Chamberlain, Robert Indiana, Ellsworth Kelly, Roy Lichtenstein, Alexander Liberman, Robert Mallary, Robert Rauschenberg, James Rosenquist; the eleventh was Claes Oldenburg. Warhol's large mural was intended to hang on the outside of the Theaterama, a circular cinema in diameter. Intending to depict \\"something to do with New York\\", and taking inspiration from Marcel Duchamp's 1923 work Wanted, $2,000 Reward (in which Duchamp put his own photograph in a wanted poster), Warhol decided to print large-scale copies of images from a booklet published on 1 February 1962 by the New York Police Department, entitled \\"The Thirteen Most Wanted\\", showing 22 head-and-shoulder mug shots of the wanted men. Silkscreens for the panels of the mural were created in early 1964, printed in silkscreen ink on Masonite panels, and the completed 5-by-5 square of front and side views (including three blank frames) was installed at the site by 15 April. Warhol stated that the work cost $4,000 to create. Government officials quickly objected to the images and on 16 April - two weeks before the fair was due to open - Philip Johnson, the architect of the pavilion, told Warhol that he must remove or replace the work within 24 hours. The stated reason was that the Governor of New York Nelson Rockefeller was concerned that the images - mostly depicting men of Italian descent - would be insulting to an important segment of his electorate. Other reasons later reported for the work being painted over included Warhol's dissatisfaction with the work, or with the way it had been hung, or his concern at possible legal liability as one of the men had been pardoned. Warhol's suggestion that he could replace the mural with 25 portraits of Robert Moses, president of the World's Fair from 1960 until 1966, was not taken up, so on 17 April he gave his permission for it to be painted over, and it had been obliterated with aluminium house paint before the fair opened to the public. Some critics have seen the monochrome silver square painted over the mural as a separate artwork, as a form of ironic comment on images of the \\"most wanted\\" men not being desired at the World's Fair. It could also be interpreted as a critique to abstract expressionism, as done by the artist constantly throughout his oeuvre, silencing the painting into abstract monochromy. Later commentators have also suggested that the title \\"wanted\\" bears a double meaning, referring to homosexual desire, with the mugshots rearranged so many of the men were looking at each other. Warhol used the same silkscreens to create a series of smaller diptych paintings on canvas that were exhibited at the Sonnabend Gallery in Paris, and then in Cologne and London, in 1967-68 The work may have partly inspired two compilations made from his Screen Tests series of 16mm films, 13 Most Beautiful Women and 13 Most Beautiful Boys, made in 1964-5. For the 50th anniversary of the World's Fair, the Queens Museum in New York put on an exhibition of related items from April to September 2014. The exhibition moved to the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh from September 2014 to January 2015.

Her memoirs were published posthumously as Teaching Arabs, Writing Self: Memoirs of an Arab-American Woman (Boston: Olive Branch Press, 2014). She is remembered on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail, and the Arab American Book Award nonfiction prize was renamed in her honor. Career Shakir grew up in West Roxbury, the younger of two children. She graduated in 1956 from Girls’ Latin School in Boston, and received a bachelor's degree from Wellesley College, where she studied English. Dr. Shakir received a master’s from Harvard and a doctorate from Boston University. Dr. Shakir taught writing for many years at Bentley University in Waltham, where she was a professor emerita, and also taught at other colleges, including Northeastern and Tufts universities. A senior Fulbright scholar, she taught in the Middle East at the University of Bahrain and the University of Damascus. Publications In 1997, Shakir published Bint Arab, for which she interviewed Arab-American women and added to their experiences the histories of her mother, Hannah Sabbagh Shakir, and her grandmothers. In part, Dr. Shakir used the book to chronicle the gradual shift among children of immigrants, principally from Lebanon and Palestine, as they moved from trying to erase their heritage through assimilation to adding the word Arab when describing themselves as American. Shakir's short story collection Remember Me to Lebanon: Stories of Lebanese Women in America is set in various eras, from the 1960s to the present and occasionally hark back even to the turn of the twentieth century. Protagonists range in age from a teenager who resists her father’s understanding of honor, to an elderly woman who returns from the grave for one last try at whipping her family into shape. Most of the stories dramatize personal issues involving negotiation between generations and cultures. But others have a political dimension—one is set against the backdrop of the Lebanese civil war; another is a response to 9/11, narrated by a woman who keeps watch all day on the Arab family next door.Harvard University Center for Middle Eastern Studies http://cmes.hmdc.harvard.edu/node/751  Books  (posthumous)  References  1938 births 2010 deaths American women writers Wellesley College alumni Harvard University alumni Boston University alumni Northeastern University faculty Tufts University faculty University of Bahrain faculty Damascus University faculty Fulbright Scholars People from West Roxbury, Boston ","title":"Evelyn Shakir"},{"id":"36052361","text":"John Merritt Young (March 16, 1922 – April 16, 2008) was an American jazz pianist.

Together with her husband John Whiting, she was a key figure in the Harvard Department of Social Relations and a pioneer in the cross-cultural study of childhood and child development. Born on Staten Island in 1914, she received her B.A. from Bryn Mawr College in 1935. She then studied anthropology at Yale. In 1943, she became one of the first women to receive a PhD from that department for her fieldwork among the Paiute Indians of Oregon. Her dissertation advisor was anthropologist George Murdock.Whiting, Beatrice Blyth. The role of sorcery in social control: A study of the Harney Valley Paiute. Yale University, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 1942. Beatrice Whiting did much of her work in collaboration with her husband John Whiting, also an anthropologist at Harvard. Often they did fieldwork together, with Beatrice focusing on the experience of women and girls and John focusing on the experience of men and boys. Beatrice Whiting joined the Harvard faculty in 1952. In 1954, she and her husband began the Six Cultures Study of Socialization, a project that involved field studies in Mexico, India, Kenya, Okinawa, the Philippines and the United States. The project continues to be regarded as one of the most ambitious comparative studies of child development and family life. In 1966, the Whitings founded the Child Development Research Unit at the University of Nairobi to conduct more intensive studies in Kenya. She became one of the first women to receive tenure at Harvard University when she was named professor at the graduate school of education in 1974. In the 1980s, after their retirement from Harvard, the Whitings turned their attention to older children, directing the Comparative Adolescence Project.

Here the cyclops is the last survivor of species who once fought the Roman Army and ends up in the Circus Maximus. Plot The film is set in Ancient Rome during the reign of Emperor Tiberius. In the countryside, a group of travelers come across some sheep and kill some for food. They are interrupted by their owner, a ferocious cyclops, the last of his kind, which kills them all but one who escapes back to Rome. There he sends word to the Emperor that a cyclops has been sighted. He sends his best commander Marcus Romulus (played by Kevin Stapleton) to capture the mankiller. Though it costs him some of his men, Marcus succeeds and takes the cyclops back to Rome. Emperor Tiberius needs a new beast for his circus. When he sees how much attention the cyclops attracts, the emperor decides to use him instead of expensive lions. A group of defiant slaves learn they are about to become cyclops fodder. They flee but in spite of all efforts the fugitives are caught rather soon. Although Marcus leads the contingent which captures them, he is against slavery and argues with the emperor's main consultant Falco (Craig Archibald). The infuriated Tiberius Caesar punishes Marcus for his insubordination by sporting him as a gladiator. Marcus does well in the arena and discovers he can teach the cyclops words and simple ideas while the swift giant is in his cell. Finally the emperor promises the cyclops freedom in return for killing Marcus. Yet the cyclops decides otherwise and kills the emperor, only to be killed in return by Falco. Marcus avenges the cyclops and becomes the liberator of Rome.

The family was active from the middle of the 12th century until the 15th century in the Swiss Plateau, mostly in the Bernese Oberaargau. There were two major branches, the Grimme and Schnabel lines which then further divided into other branches. Some of these branches owned land in Alsace and in southern Bavaria, especially in the Markgräflerland and in Breisgau. About one hundred members of the family are known today. The family name comes from Grünenberg Castle in Melchnau in the Canton of Bern. History The family was probably descended from the Langensteins. The earliest known members of the family were Walther I and Heinrich I, both of whom died before 1224. The two branches of the family were created in 1224. The founder of the younger Schnabel line, Markwart I, received the southern part of the family lands. Both branches of the family were allied with the Counts of Kyburg probably until the extinction of the Kyburg male line in 1264. The family gained some lands from the Kyburg inheritance as well as fiefs from the Habsburgs who inherited the majority of the Kyburg land. Both branches of the family remained supporters of the Habsburgs during the 13th and 14th centuries while the neighboring Old Swiss Confederation fought with the Austrian Habsburgs over land in the Swiss Plateau. The Grimme line was further divided between the descendants of Johann the Grimme I and Arnold I though eventually the descendants of Johann became the main line. Through marriage they were related to a number of other noble families in the area including the Counts of Aarburg, Balm, Wolhusen and Aarwangen. The two branches of the Grimme line acquired towns, villages and churches throughout the region during the 14th century. However, by the late 14th century the Austrians had lost their power in Oberaargau and Bern was expanding rapidly. In 1407 Wilhelm Grünenberg accepted citizenship in the city of Bern and sold some of the estates to the city. In 1414 the Schnabel line died out with Hermann. In 1432 Wilhelm sold Aarwangen to Bern, gave up his citizenship in Bern and received Rheinfelden as a Habsburg imperial fief. He was an advisor to the Emperor Frederick III. He joined the Old Zürich War on the side of the Habsburgs. When he died by 1454, male line of the Grünenberg family ended. Coat of arms The coat of arms is an example of canting arms, since the name Grünenberg means Green mountain, it always included green mountains. Normally there were six rounded mountains arraigned in a triangle with one then two then three mountains. As a crest it often had feathers and sometimes a small hut appeared on the mountains.

It was created by merging Caprivi Game Park and Mahango Game Reserve.Ministry of Environment and Tourism, Namibia 2011. State of Protected Areas in Namibia It is situated in the Zambezi and Kavango East regions, extending along the Caprivi Strip. It is bounded by the Okavango River to the west and the Kwando River to the east. Angola lies to the north and Botswana to the south. The area is an important migration route from Botswana to Angola for African elephant and some other game species. It is an unusual Protected Area as about 5,500 people live in the park. The Namibian government involves park residents and neighbours in planning and managing the park.  History  The area was first proclaimed as Caprivi Nature Park in 1963. It became the Caprivi Game Reserve in 1966 and upgraded to the Caprivi Game Park in 1968. The South African Defence Force occupied it during Namibia’s war of liberation. Conservation officials were not permitted to enter or manage the park due to military operations. The Defence Force left the area shortly before Namibia obtained Independence from South Africa in 1990. The Namibian Government commissioned a study to assess the fauna and flora and developed plans to accommodate both biodiversity protection and the 5,500 park residents. Mahango Game Reserve, to the west of the Park, was proclaimed in 1989. The Caprivi Game Park, Mahango Game Reserve and an unproclaimed area along the Cuando River were united to become Bwabwata National Park in 2007. The wreckage of LAM Mozambique Airlines Flight 470 was found in the park in November 2013.  Geography and access  The park is 40 km north to south and 190 km from west to east. Bwabwata is situated in the Caprivi and Kavango regions, extending along the Caprivi Strip. It is bounded by the Okavango River to the west and the Kwando River to the east. Angola lies to the north and Botswana to the south. The main road between the towns of Rundu and Katima Mulilo, the Trans-Caprivi Highway (B8), runs through Bwabwata, linking Namibia to Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe. A minor road (C48) dissects Mahango in a north-south direction and connects Namibia to Botswana. At either end of the Park are small settlements – Kongola in the east and Divundu in the west. The park is largely unfenced, but the southern boundary with Botswana has three veterinary standard fences. These prevent the spread of cattle diseases, such as Foot-and-mouth disease.  Biology and ecology  Bwabwata is located in the Tree and Shrub Savanna biome. Vegetation types include North-eastern Kalahari Woodland, Caprivi Mopane Woodland, Riverine Woodlands and Islands, Okavango Valley, Caprivi Floodplains. The landscape consists of low vegetated sand dunes with old drainage lines (Omiramba) in between. Bwabwata forms a crucial trans-boundary link for wildlife movement between Angola, Botswana, Namibia and Zambia.  Flora  Typical trees include Zambezi teak (Baikiaea plurijuga), wild seringa (Burkea africana), African teak (Pterocarpus angolensis), manketti (Schinziophyton rautanenii), false mopane (Guibourtia coleosperma), camelthorn tree (Acacia erioloba), jackalberry (Diospyros mespiliformis) and makalani palm (Hyphaene petersiana).Mannheimer, CA and Curtis, BA (eds) 2009. \\"Le Roux and Muller Field Guide to the Trees and Shrubs of Namibia\\". Windhoek: Macmillan Education Namibia  Fauna  Several rare large mammal and bird species are found in Bwabwata. Elephants regularly move between Namibia, Angola, Botswana and Zambia. Other species found are Cape buffalo, hippopotamus, roan antelope, sable antelope, tsessebe, zebra, wildebeest, common reedbuck, red lechwe, sitatunga and crocodile. Main predators are lion, leopard, cheetah and spotted hyena. The Mahango Area and Kavango River in western Bwabwata are listed as an internationally Important Bird Area supporting globally threatened species and is an avian diversity hotspot. Species include black-winged pratincole, slaty egret, wattled crane, African skimmer, African pygmy-goose, coppery-tailed coucal, white-backed night heron, rufous-bellied heron, Allen's gallinule, Dickinson's kestrel, black-faced babbler, swamp boubou, collared palm thrush, Meves's starling, southern ground hornbill, barred owlet, Bennett's woodpecker, wood owl, various warblers and cisticolas.BirdLife International (2012) Important Bird Areas factsheet: Mahango Game Reserve and Kavango River. Downloaded from on 26/11/2012  Fires  Fires occur almost annually and are mainly caused by humans and lightning. Although fires are a natural phenomenon in these savannas, too frequent or infrequent fires may negatively affect vegetation and fauna. A managed burning programme aims to reduce the frequency and intensity of fires.  Recreation  Visitors travelling off the main road need a permit and must drive only on designated roads. Several sandy roads, suitable for all-wheel drive vehicles, are found near the Kwando and Okavango rivers. Bwabwata has three community-operated campsites within the park, namely Nǁgoabaca, Nambwa and Bum Hill. Local communities, organised into communal area conservancies, earn revenue from these campsites. Several lodges are situated outside Bwabwata on its borders. Tour operators offer game drives, boat trips and walks in the Park. Kavango–Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area Angola, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe have agreed to manage trans-boundary conservation through the Kavango–Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (KaZa TFCA). Bwabwata is situated in the centre of the KaZa TFCA and forms a corridor for elephant movement from Botswana into Angola and Zambia.  Park management  To accommodate Bwabwata’s resident people, the Namibian Government has adopted integrated park management. The park is zoned into core areas for conservation and farming. Three areas are designated for special protection and controlled tourism – Kwando (), Buffalo (), and Mahango (). A large Multiple Use Area () is zoned for community-based tourism, trophy hunting, human settlement and farming. Park residents are mostly from the Khwe San bushmen minority group. Most residents live in Omega village in the central part of the park and several smaller settlements. Residents have formed the Kyaramacan Association to represent them. Kyaramacan manages income from tourism (the Nǁgoabaca campsite and a small lodge), from trophy hunting and the sale of devil’s claw (Harpagophytum procumbens), a plant sold internationally to reduce pain and fever. The Namibian Government, through the Ministry of Environment and Tourism, works with local communities to manage Bwabwata National Park. A technical committee, consisting of representatives from other Government departments, conservancies, community forests and non-governmental organisations, advises the Minister of Environment and Tourism. Community game guards work with the Ministry of Environment and Tourism staff to prevent poaching.Ministry of Environment and Tourism, Namibia. Bwabwata management plan (draft) 2011  Park development  Bwabwata is one of five national parks in north-eastern Namibia. It is managed as a unit with Mangetti, Khaudom National Park, Mudumu National Park and Nkasa Rupara (formerly Mamili National Park). Since 2006, the NamParks Project (formerly BMM Parks Project), co- funded by the Federal Republic of Germany through KfW has helped develop management and tourism plans and constructed new park offices and staff housing in Namibia’s north-eastern parks, including Bwabwata. The Project has helped introduce park-friendly land-uses in the surrounding areas and collaborative management structures. Management priorities include the conservation of important habitats, safeguarding corridors for regional wildlife migration; providing income for rural residents and developing tourism.

The station's platforms walls have a decoration that resembles the architecture of the mentioned bridge. The Line 2 station was opened on 15 September 1987 as the northern terminus of the extension of the line from Los Héroes. On 8 September 2004 the line was extended to Cerro Blanco. The Line 3 station was opened on 22 January 2019 as part of the inaugural section of the line, from Los Libertadores to Fernando Castillo Velasco.

That red wall that can be seen is clearly provisional, it isn't totally solid, as well as the unions with the concrete ceiling that is notably not coincident. Recently some metro offices have been built in that site. Also, it is possible to see some metal partitions that are yellow in color in to staircases (of the two platforms) towards the superior mesanine of the station. Supposedly, it hides some possible ways of access (stairs) towards the platforms of the line 3. The platforms that will be destined to the construction of the future station and that were built jointly with the now operational, will not be used. Metro modified the location of the work, placing it a few meters to the west (in direction vespucio Norte-La Cisterna), by the fact that the line 3 will go underneath Calle Bandera and not by the axis Puente-Ahumada (according to the original project) also that the fact that the trains that will be used (AS-2014) will be of broad loading gauge, unlike the NS-74 trains of the epoch.

These may have been the same vessel on sequential contracts. The first lugger Nile The first lugger Nile had a burthen of 176, and was armed with two 6-pounder guns and ten 12-pounder carronades. She served on a contract from 23 March 1799 to 21 November 1801. From 1799 to 1800 Nile was under the command of Lieutenant Ricard Whitehead. On 12 January 1800 Nile was under the command of her master, Stephen Butcher (or Bucher), Lieutenant Whitehead being ill on shore, when she captured the French privateer lugger Moderé. Modere was armed with four 4-pounder guns and had a crew of 42 men. She was only six hours out of Boulogne and hand not taken anything. As Nile was boarding her prize, came up. Captain Baker, of Nemesis took Moderé in charge and took her, as well as another captured privateer, Renard, and a recaptured brig, and took them into the Downs. Before leaving, Baker sent Nile to watch the port of Calais to try and intercept some other privateer luggers known to be out, and any captured British ships. Nile shared in the proceeds of Moderé and Renard with Nemesis and the cutter Stag. On 6 February Nile brought into Deal two recaptured West Indiamen, one, Elizabeth, had sailed from Jamaica.London Chronicle, 6–8 February 1800, p.156. At some point in early 1800, Nile and the hired armed cutter Earl Spencer recaptured Molly, which was in ballast. This was probably Molley, which had been sailing from Exeter to Newcastle when a French privateer had captured her. Molley came into Deal on 14 February.London Chronicle, 15–18 February 1800, p.165. Nile was among the many British vessels that shared in the proceeds of the capture of the French frigate Désirée, which HMS Dart, under Patrick Campbell, captured on 8 July in the Raid on Dunkirk. Nile, under Butcher, performed a useful service by laying as a leading mark at Gravelines Hook. Nile then brought the news of the action into Dover the next day.London Chronicle, 8–10 July 1800, p.40. While under Bucher's command, Nile captured Marie. On 25 July 1800 Nemesis was part of a squadron that also included Terpsichore, , , and Nile, when it encountered the Danish frigate HDMS Freja, which was escorting a convoy of two ships, two brigs and two galliots. Baker hailed her and said that he would send a boat to board the convoy. The Danish captain refused, and said that if a boat approached he would fire on it. Baker sent a midshipman and four men in a boat, and the Danes fired several shots, which missed the boat, but one of which killed a man on Nemesis. Nemesis then opened fire with her broadside. After an engagement of about 25 minutes, Freja, much damaged, struck. She had suffered eight men killed and many wounded; both Nemesis and Arrow each suffered two men killed and several wounded.London Chronicle, 26–29 July 1800, p.104. The British brought Freya and her convoy into the Downs on 6 March.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 4, p.157. They later released her, and presumably the rest of the convoy. This incident led to strained relations with Denmark, and, in order to anticipate any hostile move from Copenhagen, the British government despatched Earl Whitworth in August on a special mission to Copenhagen. The Danes not being ready for war, his mission staved off hostilities for about a year. In 1807, after the second battle of Copenhagen, the British captured Freja and took her into the Royal Navy as HMS Freya. Much less momentously, on 27 October, Nemesis and Nile captured five fishing vessels. On 1 November Nile captured the French privateer Renard off Folkestone. Lieutenant Whitehead was again sick on shore so Nile was under the command of Mr. Butcher. Renard was armed with two 3-pounder guns, and had a crew of 13 men under the command of Michael Bernard Hamelin. She had left Calais at 4pm the previous afternoon and when she was captured she was alongside a merchant ship. Second lugger Nile The second lugger Nile had a burthen of 170, was armed with fourteen 12-pounder carronades, and had a crew of 50 men. She served on a contract from 26 April March 1804 to 25 October 1806. The Admiralty paid an annual charge of £4576 for her hire.\\"Answers\\" (1911) Mariner's Mirror. Vol. 1, №6, pp.187-8. She may have been the lugger Nile of 174 tons, fourteen 12-pounder guns, and 55 men under the command of John Blake, that received a letter of marque on 21 July 1803.Letter of Marque In 1805 Nile was under the command of Lieutenant John (or George) Fennell (or Fennel). In March she captured the French chasse maree Deux Freres and the brig St François. On 17 June Nile captured the French brig Jeune Nanine. Fennel was still in command of Nile at the battle of Cape Finisterre (Calder's Action). Though the cutter Frisk and Nile stayed out of the fight and suffered no casualties, as per regulations they shared in the proceeds for the capture of the Spanish ships Firme and San Rafael. Fennel died in 1805 and his replacement, in September, was Lieutenant Symonds (or Simmonds).Naval Chronicle, Vol. 14, p.261. On 2 May 1806 Nile was in company with two Jersey privateers, the Success and the Phoenix, when they captured the Spanish brig Santa Alodias, or Alvalia. Nile may also have been the lugger Nile, of 175 tons (bm), ten 12-pounder guns, and 40 men, whose master, Thomas Butcher, received a letter of marque on 30 December 1808.

He was celebrated for his work in both France and India, earning the French Légion d'honneur in 2005. Personal life Pierre Ceyrac was born in Meyssac, Corrèze into a middle-class Catholic family. The second oldest of six children, he studied at St. Joseph Boarding School in Sarlat, along with all his brothers, including Francois Ceyrac, who would later go on to be president of the National Council of French Employers from 1972 to 1981. Career Ceyrac was attracted to a religious vocation early in life and in October 1931, became a novice of the Society of Jesus. At the age of 23, he earned a degree in Classical Letters and Philology from Sorbonne. He then chose to follow in the footsteps of his uncle Charles Ceyrac, who had been a Jesuit missionary in Southern India. In 1937, he sailed from Marseilles to India, where he would spend the rest of his life. He earned a degree in Tamil and Sanskrit from Pachaiyappa’s College where he also studied Vedanta and the Upanishads. He was ordained as a priest in 1945 at the Jesuit Seminary in Kurseong, West Bengal and finished his tertianship in 1947. Soon after, he was named as the chaplain to St. Joseph's College in Tiruchirappalli. In 1955, he became chaplain of the All India Catholic University Federation, a post he held until 1967. Inspired by Mohandas Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, he began working towards improving living conditions for the poorest Indians, notably the Untouchables. His first major project began in 1957, when he and groups of students worked to help the poor in a village near Pondicherry. They built roads, houses, and clinics in a place they called \\"Cherian Nagar\\" where 20,000 Hindus, Muslims, and Christians lived. With the help of donations from abroad as well as European and Indian volunteers, his organization was able to help thousands more across Southern India. In 1969, he established a cooperative farm in Manamadurai, Tamil Nadu that provided thousands of villagers with food and a place to work, helping over 250,000 people. Then, in the villages around the farm he started the \\"Thousand Wells\\" (Mille puits) campaign that taught the villagers how to farm previously unusable land. Following a call in 1980 from Father Arrupe, Superior General of the Jesuits and founder of the Jesuit Refugee Service, he volunteered to help the thousands of Cambodians entering Thailand, fleeing the Khmer Rouge. He taught at the Khao-I-Dang and Site Two refugee camps, where he learned the Khmer language. He ended his work there in 1992, and returned to India. After his return to Chennai, he created the Ambukarangal Centres near Tindivanam, Tamil Nadu. Taking their name from a word meaning \\"open hands,\\" these are places where orphans and children from very poor families can receive shelter, food, health care and education, as well as love and emotional support. Father Ceyrac continued his work well into his nineties, coming to the aid of fishing villages affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. He spent the last years of his life teaching at Loyola College in Chennai. Throughout his life, he campaigned for the rights and dignity of the Dalits and was an advocate for human rights. He died 30 May 2012, at the age of 98 in Chennai.FR.

Recent studies have shown that this condition, affecting between 1% and 3% of the general population, seems to have a genetic origin. Focal hyperhidrosis is sometimes referred to as The Silent Handicap, as it has a significant impact on the quality of life, affecting the individual socially, psychologically, emotionally and professionally. Indeed, the disease is accountable for more than of the cases of social anxiety disorder. Moreover, 20% of the patients suffering from focal hyperhidrosis were not able to pursue the career of their choice, and finally 71% of them endure an important lack of self-confidence (with nearly half of them suffering from depressions). Genetics In 2006, researchers uncovered that primary palmar hyperhidrosis, referring to excess sweating on the palms of the hands and feet, maps to the gene locus 14q11.2-q13. After this discovery, further research was conducted to examine if primary focal hyperhidrosis maps back to the same locus. In addition, researchers wanted to see if other previously unknown genes were responsible for different phenotypes among individuals with hyperhidrosis. Based on previous research using mice and rats, researchers looked towards the role of aquaporin 5 (AQP5), a water channel protein, in human individuals with primary focal hyperhidrosis. AQP5 has been identified as a candidate gene in many hyperhidrosis studies. Using a family that had members with primary focal hyperhidrosis, researchers found that there was no connection between primary focal hyperhidrosis and AQP5. There was also no significant connection between the gene 14q11.2-q13 locus, which was linked to primary palmar hyperhidrosis, and primary focal hyperhidrosis in this family. Due to the inconclusive findings in the study, the question as to what are the genes and proteins that play a significant role in primary focal hyperhidrosis still remains. The expression of the AQP5 protein and AQP5 mRNA was significantly higher in a patient group in comparison to the control group. In 2011, using a control group (individuals without primary focal hyperhidrosis) and a patient group (individuals with primary focal hyperhidrosis) researchers found that there was no difference between the number of sweat coils in the axillary sweat glands. This indicates that there is nothing morphologically different between individuals with and without primary focal hyperhidrosis. The discrepancies between the studies above call on further studies to confirm or deny the role of AQP5, and the role of other proteins, in hyperhidrosis. Beyond looking at the genes and individual proteins that play a role in primary focal hyperhidrosis, researchers have looked at the patterns of heredity for this trait. In a 2003 study, using multiple families, researchers found that primary focal hyperhidrosis was not a sex-linked gene, since male-to-male transmission was seen in multiple families. Instead evidence supported an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with an incomplete disease penetrance. 21 patients in this study reported a positive family history of hyperhidrosis (62%). Researchers were able to uncover this by creating pedigrees of all the participants in the study. Not every member of the pedigree exhibited forms of hyperhidrosis, which allowed the researchers to track the patterns of inheritance. The findings in this study indicated that primary focal hyperhidrosis is typically an hereditary disorder. Diagnosis Typical regions of excessive sweating include the hand palms, underarms, the sole of the foot, and sometimes groin, face, and scalp. Indeed, profuse sweating is present mostly in the underarms, followed by the feet, palms and facial region. Sweating patterns of focal hyperhidrosis are typically bilateral or symmetric and rarely occur in just one palm or one underarm. Night sweats or sweating while sleeping is also rare. The onset of focal hyperhidrosis is usually before the age of 25 years. This is in contrast to generalized hyperhidrosis which tends to occur in an older age group. Evidence demonstrates that a positive family history is also present (see the Genetics part). Treatments The Canadian Hyperhidrosis Advisory Committee has published a comprehensive set of guidelines which outlines key aspects of treatment related to this condition. Topical hyperhidrosis gels containing aluminum chloride hexahydrate are usually first choice treatments for this condition. Topical agents for Focal hyperhidrosis therapy include Formaldehyde lotion, topical anticholinergics... These agents reduce perspiration by denaturing keratin, in turn occluding the pores of the sweat glands. They have a short-lasting effect. Contact sensitization is increased, especially with formalin. In addition to topical antiperspirants (whose main active ingredients usually are aluminum or zirconium salts) treatment options include: iontophoresis (hands, feet), onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) injections (underarms, hands, feet, and other localized areas), electromagnetic/microwave energy thermolysis of underarm sweat glands (miraDry), laser-assisted removal of the sweat glands (underarms), other local procedures such as liposuction and curettage of the sweat glands (underarms), medications of the anticholinergic type that are taken by mouth, and sympathectomy surgery for sweating of the hands or head that can't be controlled by other means.

Speyer was a well-known figure on Wall Street and the firm of Speyer & Co. was well respected. It closed in 1939. Speyer was actively involved with many social, educational and cultural organizations in New York City. The House of Speyer was the third largest investment banking firm at its peak in 1913, when it managed $2.443 billion, the equivalent of $ billion. Biography Speyer was born to a Jewish family from Germany, the son of Gustav Speyer. He was educated in Frankfurt, Germany, and entered the Frankfurt branch of the Speyer family's banking house, Lazard Speyer-Ellissen, in 1883. He was subsequently connected with the Paris and London branches of the firm before returning to New York in 1885 to join Speyer & Co., the branch of the family firm there. He became the head of the family firm in 1899 and was an officer in many other banks and trust companies. In 1897, he married Ellin Lowery. Speyer was one of the founders of the Provident Loan Society and a trustee of the Teachers College at Columbia University, to which he in 1902 presented the Speyer School. He was also a trustee of the Museum of the City of New York. He was actively connected with the defeat of the Tammany Hall organization in 1894. While initially a substantial financial powerhouse, Speyer & Co. began a decline when World War I started in 1914. Speyer was pro- German, and the London office had to close. During the interwar period, the decreasing value of rail stocks, the United States' rise as a creditor nation, and official anti-Semitism in Germany contributed to further decline of the Speyer interests. Speyer's one-man-show management style was also a factor in the decline as well as his varied interests, which limited the time he gave to his banking concern. He retired in 1938, and the New York branch of the Speyer banking family, Speyer & Co,. ceased operations in 1939. At the turn of the 20th century, Speyer was deeply invested in railroads. He was financial agent for the railroad activities of Collis P. Huntington, helping him acquire bonds to buy out Charles Crocker and Leland Stanford's interests in the Central Pacific Railroad. By 1899, Speyer had de facto control of both the Central and Southern Pacific Railroads, control that allowed him to block Collis' nephew Henry from the presidency of the Southern Pacific following Collis' death and ultimately to force the younger Huntington to sell his interests in the SP to E. H. Harriman. Speyer also worked alongside J. P. Morgan (Burlington Northern Railroad) and William K. Vanderbilt (New York Central Railroad), and worked with rail interests in Mexico, London, and the Philippines. Speyer also helped to found the Economic Club of New York in 1907 and the American Museum of Safety in 1911. He was one of the founders of the University Settlement Society of New York, the first settlement house in the United States. As treasurer he raised funds for the Society's building which was erected in 1895 and he later served as the Society's president. During World War I, Speyer and his wife formed the Aqueduct Guard Citizen's Committee to aid the troops guarding the Croton Aqueduct from the Catskills to New York City. Much of this activity was centered at Waldheim, their country home at Scarborough-on- Hudson, along which property ran a portion of that aqueduct. (The estate was sold in 1947, and subdivided into building lots for modest-priced single- family homes; while the original buildings no longer exist, a large part of the original property was home to the US headquarters of Philips Research, from 1965 to 2015.)1930: Tammany, the Democratic Boss Cat of New York's City Hall Speyer was also the initiator and founder of the Museum of the City of New York. Among the other philanthropic and civic organizations served by Speyer were the Ellin Prince Speyer Hospital for Animals (founded in 1910 by Mrs. Speyer), the United Hospital Fund and the New York World's Fair Finance Committee.James Speyer papers, New York Public Library Archives In 1937, Speyer received The Hundred Year Association of New York's Gold Medal Award \\"in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York.\\" Speyer was an active opponent of prohibition, and was an officer in the Association Against Prohibition. This interest interfered with his work on behalf of the Salvation Army, which was unalterably opposed to liquor in any form.

It was published on May 12, 2009 by St. Martin's Press. The story is told from the perspective of Kyra Carlson, the protagonist, and focuses on how she deals with living in a polygamist society. Plot Kyra Carlson is a thirteen-year- old girl who has grown up in an isolated community. She has always ignored the fact that her father has three wives, and that she has twenty siblings, and two more on the way. The people of the community follow the rules and commands of The Prophet, believing that he is the son of God Himself. However, Kyra has many secrets that she has hidden from her family; she secretly reads books that she borrows from a mobile library (even though reading is forbidden) and she has been secretly romancing with a boy named Joshua (even though a man is supposed to be chosen for her). One day, while The Prophet is eating dinner with the Carlson family, he announces that Kyra shall marry her sixty-year-old Uncle Hyrum, who already has six wives. Kyra rebels, as she is in love with Joshua, but her family is unable to help her. When the two young lovers plead with The Prophet, he has them both whipped and abused. Kyra then enlists the help of Patrick, the owner of the mobile library. Patrick tries to help her escape from the community, but he is shot and killed, while Kyra is dragged back and abused once more. Since The Prophet had ordered for Joshua to be banished from the community and left to die (since he is a \\"culprit\\"), Joshua escapes the community with two other boys after telling Kyra that he will come looking for her later. In her demise, Kyra tries to escape once more and has almost gotten away when she notices the sheriff chasing her. She calls the police and help arrives.

The 2012 National Reconnaissance Office space telescope donation to NASA was the declassification and donation to NASA of two identical space telescopes by the United States National Reconnaissance Office. The donation has been described by scientists as a substantial improvement over NASA's current Hubble Space Telescope. Although the telescopes themselves are being given to NASA at no cost, the space agency must still pay for the cost of instruments and electronics for the telescopes, as well as the launch of the telescopes. On February 17, 2016, the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) was formally designated as a mission by NASA, predicated on using one of the space telescopes.  Background  While the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s Hubble Space Telescope has collected a large amount of astrophysical data, has outlived all expectations, and has been described as one of the space agency's most successful missions, the instrument will soon succumb to the extreme environment of space. In addition, with the James Webb Space Telescope costing at least US$9 billion, the agency's astrophysics budget is extremely strained. As a result, NASA's other astrophysics missions have been delayed until funding becomes available. In January 2011 the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) revealed to NASA the existence of two unneeded telescopes, originally built as reconnaissance satellites, and available to the civilian agency. NASA accepted the offer in August 2011 and announced the donation on 4 June 2012. The instruments were constructed between the late 1990s and early 2000s, reportedly for NRO's unsuccessful Future Imagery Architecture program; in addition to the two completed telescopes, a primary mirror and other parts for a third also exist. While NRO considers them to be obsolete, the telescopes are nevertheless new and unused. All CCDs and electronics have been removed, however, and NASA must add them at its own expense. When the telescopes' specifications were presented to scientists, large portions were censored due to national security. An unnamed space analyst stated that the instruments may be a part of the KH-11 Kennen line of satellites which have been launched since 1976, but which have now been largely superseded by newer telescopes with wider fields of view than the KH-11. The analyst stated, however, that the telescopes have \\"state-of-the art optics\\" despite their obsolescence for reconnaissance purposes.  Potential uses  The early consensus for the usage of the telescopes was to follow the NASA Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey of 2010, which lists the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) as its highest priority. Observing in the infrared section of the electromagnetic spectrum, WFIRST will be used to study the role of dark energy in the Universe, as well as to directly image Jupiter-sized extrasolar planets. The NRO telescope design has several features which make it useful for WFIRST and superior to the Hubble. The NRO instrument's 2.4m primary mirror is the same size and quality as the Hubble's. With double the mirror diameter of the original WFIRST design, it allows for up to twice the image resolution and gathers four times the light. Unlike civilian telescopes, the NRO instrument also has a steerable secondary mirror for additional precision. The telescope has a much wider field of view than Hubble due to its shorter focal length, allowing it to observe about 100 times the area at any given time as Hubble can. This has led to the donated telescopes' characterization as \\"Stubby Hubbles\\". Their obstructed design, however, may make imaging extrasolar planets more challenging, and would be unsuitable for imaging the most distant galaxies at its longest infrared wavelengths, which requires cooling beyond the original NRO design temperature range. Whether using the NRO telescopes would save NASA money is unclear. While each is worth at least $250 million, their larger size compared to the proposed WFIRST design would require a larger rocket and camera. According to one NASA estimate using an NRO telescope would raise the cost of WFIRST by $250 million above its $1.5 billion budget. Another estimate states that NASA would save up to $250 million. The agency's deputy acting director for astrophysics Michael Moore states that using both telescopes may ultimately save NASA $1.5 billion. David Spergel estimates that using an NRO telescope would add about $100 million to WFIRST's cost, but would prefer to spend another $200 million for a coronagraph to improve its direct-imaging capability. Due to the budgetary constraints arising from the continued construction of the James Webb Space Telescope, NASA has stated that WFIRST may not be launched until 2024 at the earliest, despite early speculation that by using an NRO telescope the mission might launch by roughly 2020, at about the same time as the European Space Agency's Euclid. In addition, the availability of a telescope is believed to increase the probability that the mission will be launched at all. While the first telescope is planned for use as the basis for WFIRST, NASA currently does not have plans or funding for the usage of the second. Astronomers have begun to study possible additional uses, and NASA is considering dozens of proposals; the only prohibition is Earth observation, a condition of the NRO donation. Possibilities include observing Earth's aurora and ionosphere, or asteroids and other faint objects within the solar system. NASA has also suggested that the telescope could be sent to Mars, photographing the surface with a resolution about four times finer than the current Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's HiRISE instrument. From Martian orbit the telescope could also view the outer Solar System and the asteroid belt.

Produced by Ulver, the album was recorded live in Crystal Canyon Studios, Oslo, over two sessions, in autumn 2008 and summer 2011, and issued in May, 2012 on Jester Records under exclusive license to Kscope. The album is a collection of covers of \\"60s psychedelic chestnuts,” a reinterpretation of mostly obscure 1960s psychedelia, intended by Ulver as a reflection on lost innocence. In a Kscope video interview, Kristoffer Rygg commented, “I grew up with parents who were still listening to music from the time, so it informed my childhood, and it has become an ever increasing geeky sort of fetish since then.“ Adding, “My feeling is that most people's knowledge sort of limits itself to The Doors. The Doors were cool, but there was so much else going on… in the underground, records that got lost and didn't get as much recognition as they deserved in my opinion. We wish to be ambassadors for things that we love and we sort of hope that we can open some gates with the record.” The album includes versions of songs by The Pretty Things, The Byrds, Bonniwell's Music Machine, We the People, Jefferson Airplane, Gandalf, The Electric Prunes, The 13th Floor Elevators, The Troggs, The Left Banke, The Beau Brummels, Common People, Music Emporium, Curt Boettcher, The Fleur de Lys, and The United States of America. The cover features a photograph by Hoang Van Danh of Phan Thi Kim Phuc fleeing a napalm attack by the Republic of Vietnam Air Force in 1972. A music video for \\"Magic Hollow\\", directed by Justin Oakey, was released in April 2012. Background Frontman Kristoffer Rygg explained that Childhood's End was \\"one of those projects I'd been meaning to do for some time. In my 20s I found myself coming up short with new things to like. It wasn't until the late '90s when I discovered a true fascination with psychedelic music, and even prog. That was when '60s and '70s music really took hold, and I've been more and more into it ever since. I listen to a lot more stuff from that era than I do modern music.\\" Rygg spent considerable time \\"digging around\\" to find the right songs to cover and explained that \\"[t]here's a missionary aspect to all this too, to make an exclamation mark to the fact that there are fucking golden nuggets before your Black Sabbaths.\\" Rygg describes the album as connected to the themes of Ulver's 1998 album, Themes from William Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, in that both explore \\"the same idea of shattered illusions and a lost childhood\\". He elaborated this by explaining that the 1960s were \\"sort of a cultural movement... that became disillusioned and quite dark. I was thinking of a kind of Blakean strain, a loss of innocence. I've always thought that this particular era and the spirituality of it was very childlike in many ways. Suddenly there was Altamont and Charles Manson, cocaine and heroin, then Watergate later\\". The album was recorded in two sessions. The first, in autumn 2008, featured Lars Pedersen on drums. For the second session, in summer 2011, Tomas Pettersen drummed. Reception The album received generally favourable reviews. Ben Ratliffe, writing for The New York Times, praised Childhood's End for its treatment of the original music, commenting that \\"these cover versions reward the ambition of the original songs, draping them with stateliness\\". Placing the album in the context of Ulver's discography, Ratliffe noted that Childhood's End is \\"the most straight-ahead Ulver record ever, but still strange\\". Natalie Zina Walschots wrote similarly in Exclaim!, describing the album as \\"deceptively simple\\", featuring an \\"achingly familiar\\" set of songs that, \\"rather than evoking fondness or nostalgia, conjure the unsettling shadow versions of themselves\\". David Fricke, with Rolling Stone magazine, wrote that the album \\"is more than hip-covers fun\\" that \\"darken[s] the apocalypse in acid-Sixties relics\\". Stating that Ulver's choice of covers possesses a kinship with the band's own creative ambitions, Sound and Visions Michael Berk observed that Childhood's End \\"is not so much a departure as a literature review; drawing the connections between Ulver's own experimentalism and the psych bands who, possibly without a clear idea of what they were doing, pushed the boundaries of rock in the '60s further than any of their mainstream contemporaries\\". Dayal Patterson, writing for Record Collector, said “Ulver are nothing if not unpredictable and ever-evolving. With a contemporary edge that occasionally removes the furry ambiguities of the originals and replaces them with a dark sense of the epic, the album bears enough of Ulver’s touch (particularly thanks to founder Kristoffer Rygg’s vocals), meaning that this should be palatable for fans of the band new to garage and psychedelic music. Others will find this rewarding – if perhaps a little unnecessary – and there’s little questioning the delivery or attention to detail here. Probably not at the top of the wish list for most followers of the group, but a pretty successful deviation nonetheless.” Track listing Personnel  ;Ulver *Kristoffer Rygg - vocals, programming, producer *Tore Ylwizaker - keyboards, programming, producer *Jørn H.

He is portrayed by Dylan Minnette. The character first appeared in \\"Pilot\\" and last appeared in \\"Turtles All the Way Down\\". He appears in Michael's green reality (where Hannah is dead from the car crash). This is because it is his favorite color. Rex was created and designed by series creator and executive producer Kyle Killen after he created and developed the series Lone Star for the Fox network; Killen had been called in to pitch a new drama for NBC after the cancellation of Lone Star. As a teenager, Rex is the only son and child of Michael and Hannah. He is currently a teenager at school.  Role in Awake  Rex Britten is the son of Michael and Hannah. He is the only child in the family, and is featured in Michael's green reality (where Hannah is dead from the car crash). He is currently an American teenager at school. He has had a number of remarkable experiences in many episodes.  Character = Creation  Kyle Killen (pictured) created Rex after developing Lone Star for the Fox network. Kyle Killen conceived of Rex and the rest of the family and series in 2011 after a report that NBC had purchased the series from the creator Killen, under the original name REM. Killen had been called in to pitch a new drama for NBC, after Jennifer Salke, the president of the entertainment division of NBC, encouraged Killen to conceive a concept for a new drama television series after the cancellation of Lone Star on the Fox network. Within a few weeks, Killen sent a rough draft of the script to his agent Marc Korman. \\"It was 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning, and I remember I was so freaked out by the script that I went upstairs to our guest bedroom where my wife was sick with the flu and I got into bed with her,\\" recalled Korman. \\"I called Jen and said: 'I'm telling you, this script is remarkable. I've never read a pilot like this, and for a guy who has never written a procedural show in his life, he's actually making two cases work\\". Initially, Salke and Korman looked to sell acquisition rights to Fox. Rex made his debut with the rest of the Britten family on March 1, 2012, in \\"Pilot\\" on NBC. He marked his last appearance on May 24, 2012, in \\"Turtles All the Way Down\\" on the same network as in first episode.  Casting  Dylan Minnette (pictured) obtained the role of Rex Britten in March 2011, alongside five other members. In March 2011, Dylan Minnette obtained the role of the character. Minnette commended the episode's script, and noted the auditioning sequence was fast. He stated, \\"The process of getting the job actually went by really fast because the first audition Kyle Killen [...] was in the room, Jason [Isaacs] was in the room, the cast director was in the room and the director was in the room. David Slade. And they were all there, for the first audition and I was like 'Wow! Okay.'\\" Minnette received the role two weeks after his audition. According to an interview, Dylan Minnette himself is a fan of the character and series.  Personality  Since his mother's death in the \\"green reality\\", he has been very emotional and angry. He had a tennis racket which he put in his bag after his mother died: his friend Cole accidentally broke it, in \\"Oregon\\". Rex and his friend Cole also claim to be going to the beach, although they are really going to work on their motorbike, a bike Rex had worked on for years. He doesn't like \\"cereal and oatmeal night\\", which is their dinner for the night, he criticized it, claiming that his mother \\"cooked actual food\\".  Reception = Analysis  Dylan Minnette' role as Rex has been met with praise by many television commentators, who felt he effectively embodied the characteristics of the lead role. Kelly West of Cinema Blend praised his role. He claimed that \\"Laura Allen and Dylan Minnette also deliver strong performances as Michael’s wife and son respectively. As do Wilmer Valderrama and Steve Harris, who play Michael's partners\\". Rex's motorbike was praised by TV Fanatic Lindey Kempton called it \\"a nice touch\\", \\"personal\\", \\"not unrealistic\\", and \\"it helped start developing his character a little bit\\".

It leaked from the oil refinery at Duque de Caxias (REDUC) operated by Petrobras. Petrobas the company at the center of the oil spill immediately moved into gear and hired a cleanup crew to assess the damages and start the process to cleaning up the affected areas. This catastrophic accident had a damaging effect on marine life in the ocean, fishes, as well as, other existing areas surrounding the bay area. Many fishes were washing up on the shore dead or covered in oil. The fishing industry took a nose dive and the fishermen's livelihood was gravely affected. As a matter of fact, the fishing industry was brought to a halt giving rise to economic downfall. There was astronomical cost to be incurred with the clean-up process and the stakeholders were in a state of growing panic. Large areas of mangrove forests were killed and had not grown back ten years later. The tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis) dolphin species inhabit the bay but were able to avoid the primary effects of the oil spill. The oil spill was a catalyst for the passage of new environmental law in Brazil. Effects There were affects to society and to the marine life and environment at large. The fishing industry suffered tremendously. The fishes and crabs could not get oxygen and as a result, they succumbed to death.Harvard Business Review on Greening Your Business Profitably. Boston, Mass: Harvard Business Review Press, 2011Print. Hofer, Tobias. Marine pollution: new research. New York: Nova Science Publishers, 2008 The aquatic plant life e.g. (The mangrove in the bay) began to wither and die because of the oil being trapped on the surface of the water.\\"Brazil Suffers Second Big Oil Spill in Two Weeks.\\" Standard - Freeholder: 8.

ABI/INFORM Complete; OxResearch; ProQuest Central; ProQuest Criminal Justice; ProQuest Education Journals; ProQuest Health Management; ProQuest Research Library; ProQuest Social Science Journals. Web. 5 Mar. 2013 . One major concern that the fishermen had was concerning the fish that survived the oil spill. They had no aquatic plants to feed because the plant life in the ocean became non-existent as the oil settle itself on the ocean surface. The fishermen, who relied on fishing for their livelihood, could not have a catch to depend on, and soon the industry resorted to lost of employment for fishermen, trading lost among crab vendors, and loss of revenue for families who depended on fishing as their primary means of survival. Even a decade of efforts by the Petrobras refinery was not enough to restore the Bay to its original condition. Clean-up costs The cost of the clean-up and the drastic effect the spill had on the fishing industry remained for many years to come. The Petrobras refinery who were responsible for the spill in the first place, accepted liabilities and promised to execute the cleanup process. Among the affected areas were the beaches, mangrove mashes, and the surrounding areas leading to the beach front (pathways and tunnels). There were also, dead birds and fishers along the shoreline of the front. The actual cleanup process cost Petrobras over $100,000,000. The process of recovery, environmental cleaning and compensation for damages took a significant toll on the company's expenditures, which resulted in great profit loss for Petrobras. Their years of efforts was overwhelming, but the result did little to justify the labor extended to the task. Economical impact of the Guanabara Bay Oil Spill on Brazilian society The spill impacted the Brazilian society and the overall economy on a hold. The massive death and extinction of many species of fish prompted a significant decrease in the number of fish that supported the bay. A total of about 4000 of the total 6000 fishermen in the Guanabara Bay had resorted to alternative sources of income and jobs, because of the decline in the fishing industry. According to some fishermen in the region one can hardly obtain ten kilos of catch, a scenario which was contrary to the previous period before the spillage when the fishermen could obtain a catch of 100 kilos or more. The quality of the fish from the bay area had also been a source of concern. Research findings have shown that the fish surrounding the bay area was contaminated; therefore the prices in the region were valued at half the price because of quality. In addition, the Petrobas refinery company also lost a substantial amount of money through fines from the Brazilian Government, as well as, compensation and other strict environmental conservation concerns. To combat this growing onslaught Petrobas developed some environmental conservation strategies by putting strict methods and policies in place to offset its critics. However, these measures proved to be extremely costly, putting a dent in the company's fiscal stability. Stakeholders affected from disaster Greenpeace (an environmental bureau set up by the government ) challenged Petrobras on its demand to observe dramatic changes on corporate policies. They questioned their ability to execute the environmental conservation mandate and were very vocal in their disapproval of their handling of the situation. To gain some ground Petrobras argued that the spill was caused, not by dumping of oil, but by a broken pipeline, a mere accident that did not result in customer's being revengeful or unaccommodating.The Petroleum Economist. London: Petroleum Press Bureau, 1974. Print. Wang, Zhendi, and Scott A. Stout. Oil Spill Environmental Forensics: Fingerprinting and Source Identification. Amsterdam: Elsevier/Academic Press, 2007. Internet resource The other affected stakeholders were the government of Brazil, the local authorities, the fishermen in the region, the local business people and the Petrobras refinery company. The fishermen were affected by the decreased in the number of fishes that influenced their daily catch, as well as, the fish quality. There was a high level of contamination in the fishes that occupied the bay area. The local authorities were also affected by the spillage, since it led to the halt of the activities at the coast that would attribute to government revenue collection. The government was first affected by the challenge the event caused on its policies and they had to make immediate re-adjustment. New policies had to be adopted to cater for future tragedies of this nature. Petrobras Refinery Company was the hardest hit, since they had to pay huge fines of over 28 million dollars for the damages caused as a result, of the oil spill. Compensation was also paid out to affected citizens within the bay area and adjacent to it.International Environment Reporter: Current Report. Washington: Bureau of National Affairs,1978. Print. Perry, Chris, and Kevin Taylor. Environmental Sedimentology. Malden, MA: Blackwell Pub,m 2007. Print. Changes in government regulations Changes and regulatory policies became the order of the day for the government following the oil spill. Transforming the way government performed its regulatory measures were address. One of the main changes that occurred was the enhanced precision by which the governing and the oil industries handle the environmental requirements for incidents such as this oil spill. The government changed their regulations and demanded Risk Management and an Emergency Plan to be put in place. Every oil institution must execute “oil Pollution Risk Assessment”.\\"THE AMERICAS Brazil Discovers New Leak Near Oil Refinery.\\" Orange County Register: 0. Jan 30 2000. ABI/INFORM Complete; National Newspapers Premier; OxResearch; ProQuest Central; ProQuest Criminal Justice; ProQuest Education Journals; ProQuest Health Management; ProQuest Research Library; ProQuest Social Science Journals. Web. 4 Mar. 2013 . This law demanded an inclusive policy manual on the avoidance of oil pollution accident. The “Emergency plan” had to take effect during an oil spill and must have the official endorsement of the environmental bureau (Greenpeace). In order to drive home the seriousness of the situation the Government established a task force (in addition to Greenpeace) to regulate and enforce the plans that were laid out by the environmental bureau. This was done in the form of an auditing team. This team must be independent and not be affiliated with any of the immediate parties (government or oil company). Oil industries were given strict guidelines to observe these regulations, by creating higher standards within their institution. This was a very challenging experience for the oil companies, who had suffered enormous financial loss during this period. Complying with the regulation was a must, but the effect it had on the oil companies was tremendous.Buckley, Stephen.\\"Brazil Fights Giant Oil Spill; Damage Appears Checked; State-Owned Firm Faces 2nd Major Fine this Year The Washington Post: 0.

Company changes as a result Immediate work was done to ensure that Government policies were adhered to:  Immediate replacement of storage tanks as well as, underground piping facilities was done to avoid any more disaster. A compulsory replacement plan was put in place to ensure that compliance was followed and adhered too.  Transportation method was another important aspect of change that had to be address. The policy demanded a merit based approval of the transportation vessels to minimize or eliminate spillage.  There had to be strict approval policies that required stable channels and vessels for the transportation of oil within the environment.

Gold was discovered at the site of Charters Towers in late 1871 by a prospecting party composed of Hugh Mosman, George Clark, James Fraser and an Aboriginal boy called Jupiter who worked for Mosman. By early 1872 a rush was in progress with an estimated 4,500 on the field by the end of the year. In 1874, following goldfield regulations, a business area was marked out in an area believed to be non-auriferous. In 1877 when Charters Towers petitioned for incorporation as a municipality (the Borough of Charters Towers), this business area was defined as covering one square mile, measured as a half mile in each compass direction from the intersection of Gill and Mosman Streets. This area was the key business and social centre of the town. The economics of Charters Towers were closely bound up with the geology of the field. The gold was not alluvial, but in the form of reefs of gold-bearing ore. This meant that equipment to extract it and to dig shafts was needed from the start. There were several major reefs and they sloped downwards with loops and branches. The ore near the surface was extracted first. Later, deeper and deeper shafts were necessary to find and extract the gold. At first, small syndicates of miners, crushing mills and local business men financed the mines. As the lodes ran deeper, more capital was needed to exploit them than was available locally. In 1885 several Mining Agents formed themselves into a Mining Exchange. This made speculation through the buying and selling of mine shares possible. In 1886, a display featuring ore samples from the Charters Towers mines was set up at the Colonial and Indian Exhibition in London. At the time, some mines were producing extraordinary quantities of gold. The response from British investors resulted in a speculation boom. This did not hold, collapsing in 1888, but as the fabled Brilliant Reef was discovered in the following year, the fortunes of the field were not depressed for long. The boom had encouraged a number of local businessmen to replace their timber buildings with more substantial brick structures. Alexander Malcolm, who had been on the field since the early 1870s was one of these, replacing his Malcolm's Buildings in Mosman Streets with an elegant arcade of shops and offices. The arcade was designed for him by Sydney architect Mark Cooper Day and was named the Royal Arcade. left In 1890 the Stock Exchange reformed along better organised lines and looked for new premises. The Royal Arcade was a wise choice, being centrally placed in the main business area and close to agents and banks. The Exchange signed an initial three year lease for the use of an office and the courtyard for their evening call at a rent of ten pounds a month. To begin with, two calls a day were made, one at noon and another, open to the public, in the evening. Public interest was such that this evening call was attended by crowds. In 1892 the introduction of the McArthur-Forrest cyanide process boosted gold production for the field which peaked in 1899 at . The population also peaked in this year at around 26,500. Charters Towers was now the second most important city in Queensland and an internationally noted goldfield. leftAfter 1899, the yield of Charters Towers mines gradually diminished and increasing costs, due to the great depths at which gold was being mined, saw the return to investors falling. In 1912 the Warden reported that the extreme depth for profitable mining had been reached. The population fell sharply, as many people moved to coastal towns. In 1916, with little interest in new ventures from investors, the stock exchange closed. Falling real estates values and vacant buildings allowed a number of private schools to establish themselves, providing a new economic life for Charters Towers as an educational centre. Lack of pressure for expansion and development in Charters Towers meant that many of the buildings dating from the period when it was a world famous goldfield survived remarkably intact. However, the arcade was too large and grand for the reduced population and the type of business that they supported. The cost of maintenance eventually exceeded income from the building and it fell into disrepair. In 1971 it was acquired by the Charters Towers City Council as trustee for the Charters Towers and Dalrymple Historical Society. It was restored in conjunction with the National Trust of Queensland and when a National Trust Branch was formed in Charters Towers, ownership of the arcade was transferred to the National Trust. The first stage of the conservation repaired the section facing the street, completed in 1972. The second stage conserved the rest of the building in 1975. The building is now used for offices and shops. The art gallery which occupies the upper floor is named for architect Don Roderick, who has strong associations with Charters Tower and worked on a voluntary basis with the builder, Bob Aitken, to carry out the urgent work which saved the building and made it usable again.  Description  Glazed vaulted roof (seen from the rear of the building), 2012 The Stock Exchange Arcade is a masonry arcade of small offices on both sides of a central court covered with a glazed vault which is supported by steel trusses with decorative inset webs. It is now glazed with modern wired glass. The arcade floor is tessellated tiles. It is entered through a two storey structure which has offices on the upper floor and shops at street level. The central entrance is protected by a barrel-vaulted portico which projects out from the second storey over the pavement and is supported on timber posts. The vault is clad with galvanised iron and glazed in at the front with a variety of coloured glass incorporating cast iron panels. It is flanked on the upper storey by pairs of windows and by a metal awning supported by posts to the street on the lower floor. The facade is topped by a stepped, balustraded parapet. The shop fronts facing the street and within the arcade incorporate large timber framed windows with coloured glass above and cast iron vents above and below. Most of the joinery to the shop fronts is reconstructed. The original timber stairs lead up to the rooms at first floor level which are linked by a bridge with a cast iron balustrade. The wrought iron fence thought to have originally been at the rear of the arcade is now located at the front. A large, single storey brick assay house with a galvanised iron roof which contains a small collection of mining artefacts is attached to the rear on one side and a modern toilet block to the other. The back of the property is grassed with a chain wire fence to the land behind. The lamp standard is not original.  Heritage listing  Stock Exchange Arcade was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Stock Exchange Arcade is emblematic of the importance of the discovery of gold to the development of north Queensland. It was one of only two stock exchanges outside the capital, both of which were on goldfields (the other being the Gympie Stock Exchange). Its grand architecture illustrates the wealth and confidence of Charters Towers in the nineteenth century. The abrupt finish to the arcade, which appears to be uncompleted, evokes the rise and fall of fortunes typically connected with goldfield towns. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. It is a rare, early example of an arcade in Queensland and has aesthetic value as a work of architecture that is well liked by the community for its scale, landmark barrel vault entrance, traditional shop fronts, material and detail. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.

It was formed in December 1941, and graduated its first course in March 1942. Responsible for intermediate and advanced instruction of pilots under the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS), the school was based at RAAF Station Bundaberg, Queensland, and operated Avro Anson aircraft. It spawned two maritime patrol squadrons in early 1943, raised in response to increased Japanese submarine activity off Australia's east coast. Some of the school's aircraft were also attached to the Australian Army in 1944–45. No. 8 SFTS completed its final training course in December 1944, and was disbanded in July 1945. History RAAF aircrew training expanded dramatically following the outbreak of World War II, in response to Australia's participation in the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS). The Air Force's pre-war flight training facility, No. 1 Flying Training School at RAAF Station Point Cook, Victoria, was supplanted in 1940–41 by twelve Elementary Flying Training Schools (EFTS), eight Service Flying Training Schools (SFTS), and Central Flying School (CFS).Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 67–70Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942, p. 111 While CFS turned out new flight instructors, the EFTS provided basic training to prospective pilots who, if successful, would go on to an SFTS for further instruction that focussed on operational (or \\"service\\") flying.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942, p. 97 The course at SFTS typically consisted of two streams, intermediate and advanced, and included such techniques as instrument flying, night flying, advanced aerobatics, formation flying, dive bombing, and aerial gunnery.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942, p. 109 The total duration of training varied during the war as demand for aircrew rose and fell. Initially running for 16 weeks, the course was cut to 10 weeks (which included 75 hours flying time) in October 1940. A year later it was raised to 12 weeks (including 100 hours flying time), and again to 16 weeks two months later. It continued to increase after this, peaking at 28 weeks in June 1944.

No. 8 SFTS received its first aircraft in January 1942: 27 Avro Ansons released by other units. The same month, No. 12 EFTS transferred to its permanent home at RAAF Station Lowood. The standard intake of pilots at No. 8 SFTS each month was 50, and the initial course of students graduated in March 1942. By July that year, the total number of aircraft operated by the school had increased to 87. Flying accidents were commonplace at training establishments and No. 8 SFTS was no exception; taxiing collisions, crash landings in the surrounding cane fields, and runway overshoots were regular occurrences. At least two aircraft were damaged each month in the early part of 1942. The school's first fatality, however, was from drowning, when staff were called out to assist victims of local flooding in February, and an aircraftman died during an attempted rescue.

With the lessening of Japanese submarine activity towards the end of 1943, the staff and aircraft of No. 66 Squadron were judged to be more urgently needed for training purposes; the unit was disbanded on 6 January 1944 and its assets divided between No. 8 SFTS and No. 1 Operational Training Unit at RAAF Station East Sale, Victoria, as well as No. 71 Squadron. No. 71 Squadron was itself disbanded on 28 August 1944 at Coffs Harbour. One of the flying school's graduates in August 1944 was David Evans, who went on to become Chief of the Air Staff.Evans, Down to Earth, pp. 9, 235 His passing-out parade was delayed by a month because, as Evans later discovered, the British government had peremptorily decided in April that it no longer required graduates from Australia, leaving the RAAF with a surplus of some 7,000 aircrew.Evans, Down to Earth, pp. 12–13 With training at No. 8 SFTS winding down, in October 1944 a civil operator, Aircraft Pty Ltd, began using Bundaberg for its flights between Brisbane and Rockhampton. The following month, six of the school's Ansons were detached to the Australian Army, carrying out exercises with I Corps at Mareeba until March 1945. The last course to graduate at No. 8 SFTS did so on 13 December 1944; all pilots still under instruction were transferred to No. 6 Service Flying Training School at RAAF Station Mallala, South Australia, to finish their course. The school spent the next few months preparing the base to be handed over to elements of the Netherlands East Indies Air Force before disbanding on 25 July 1945.

From his North Queensland property, Adel's Grove, de Lestang supplied seeds and plants to botanical gardens around the world. In 1946 he supplied seeds of a rare white-flowered water lily that the botanical world had been chasing since 1852. The seeds were sent to Kew Gardens but forwarded to Texas for propagation. The lily was originally referred to as a form of Nymphaea gigantea but is currently identified as a new species N. carpentariae. The cultivar 'Albert De L'Estang' is thought to be a different species, N. immutabilis. Born in Argentina to French-speaking parents, Albert de Lestang travelled around the world before settling in outback Queensland in the Gulf Country around 1920 taking up a freehold property in that region. Although there is no official confirmation, it is believed he was commissioned by the Queensland Government to experiment with the growing of tropical fruits and trees along Lawn Hill Creek. He used the creek for the supply of water for his project, pumping water to wells through canals near his plantings. Water also had to be transported in kerosene tins.priest, Del \\"A Man with a Dream\\" unpublished article CTADFHA Library Collection By 1939 he had a list of over 1000 species introduced to his property. This list was forwarded to the Government Botanists C. T. White and W. D. Francis. His gathering of seeds for identification extends from 1925 with most being collected between 1938 and 1953. Brisbane Botanic Gardens has a collection of 536 different seed species provided by de Lestang. He also provided seeds to overseas contacts including Kew Gardens in England. It appears he had good relationships with the local aborigines employing them as seed gatherers. A small portion of his botanical oasis and some remains of his irrigation system still exist at Adel's Grove, \\"The Frenchman's Garden\\" now a tourist camping site surrounded by Lawn Hill Station. The name is made up form the initial letters of his own name. His origins are unclear. In a newspaper article in 1946 Mr. Trickett of Kew Gardens is quoted as saying De Lestang advised him that he ran away from his home in England following an argument with his father after a quarrel over a girl. The Brisbane Courier of 8 January 1914 contains an advertisement where A. De Lestang requests a position with horse breeders and dealers advising he had 15 years experience with horses and mules throughout Spain, France and Argentina. An article in the Cairns Post of 10 October 1923 carries a letter from the geologist Edward Grey advising he is part of an private expedition under the leadership of De Lestang making a crossing of the Australian continent collecting scientific data. He also ran a store at Adels' Grove for passing travelers. Unfortunately sometime in the 1950s, floods and native animals damaged his trees (believed to number 2000 by then.) Soon after, while he was absent from his home, fire destroyed his dwelling, possessions, his research and further damaged his botanical collection. Disheartened, suffering the effects of old age he eventually entered Charters Towers Eventide Home for the Aged where he spent his final years. Despite his attempts to find someone to take over the garden, it eventually succumbed to neglect, becoming a miners camp.

In contrast, the Schrödinger picture uses the position or momentum representations (see also position and momentum space). The two key features of the phase-space formulation are that the quantum state is described by a quasiprobability distribution (instead of a wave function, state vector, or density matrix) and operator multiplication is replaced by a star product. The theory was fully developed by Hilbrand Groenewold in 1946 in his PhD thesis, and independently by Joe Moyal, each building on earlier ideas by Hermann Weyl and Eugene Wigner. The chief advantage of the phase-space formulation is that it makes quantum mechanics appear as similar to Hamiltonian mechanics as possible by avoiding the operator formalism, thereby \\"'freeing' the quantization of the 'burden' of the Hilbert space\\". This formulation is statistical in nature and offers logical connections between quantum mechanics and classical statistical mechanics, enabling a natural comparison between the two (see classical limit). Quantum mechanics in phase space is often favored in certain quantum optics applications (see optical phase space), or in the study of decoherence and a range of specialized technical problems, though otherwise the formalism is less commonly employed in practical situations. The conceptual ideas underlying the development of quantum mechanics in phase space have branched into mathematical offshoots such as Kontsevich's deformation-quantization (see Kontsevich quantization formula) and noncommutative geometry. Phase-space distribution The phase-space distribution of a quantum state is a quasiprobability distribution. In the phase-space formulation, the phase-space distribution may be treated as the fundamental, primitive description of the quantum system, without any reference to wave functions or density matrices.C. Zachos, D. Fairlie, and T. Curtright, \\"Quantum Mechanics in Phase Space\\" (World Scientific, Singapore, 2005) . There are several different ways to represent the distribution, all interrelated. The most noteworthy is the Wigner representation, , discovered first. Other representations (in approximately descending order of prevalence in the literature) include the Glauber–Sudarshan P, Husimi Q,Kôdi Husimi (1940). \\"Some Formal Properties of the Density Matrix\\", Proc. Phys. Math. Soc. Jpn. 22: 264–314. Kirkwood–Rihaczek, Mehta, Rivier, and Born–Jordan representations.; . These alternatives are most useful when the Hamiltonian takes a particular form, such as normal order for the Glauber–Sudarshan P-representation. Since the Wigner representation is the most common, this article will usually stick to it, unless otherwise specified. The phase-space distribution possesses properties akin to the probability density in a 2n-dimensional phase space. For example, it is real-valued, unlike the generally complex-valued wave function. We can understand the probability of lying within a position interval, for example, by integrating the Wigner function over all momenta and over the position interval: :\\\\operatorname P [a \\\\leq X \\\\leq b] = \\\\int_a^b \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} W(x, p) \\\\, dp \\\\, dx. If is an operator representing an observable, it may be mapped to phase space as through the Wigner transform. Conversely, this operator may be recovered by the Weyl transform. The expectation value of the observable with respect to the phase-space distribution is :\\\\langle \\\\hat{A} \\\\rangle = \\\\int A(x, p) W(x, p) \\\\, dp \\\\, dx. A point of caution, however: despite the similarity in appearance, is not a genuine joint probability distribution, because regions under it do not represent mutually exclusive states, as required in the third axiom of probability theory. Moreover, it can, in general, take negative values even for pure states, with the unique exception of (optionally squeezed) coherent states, in violation of the first axiom. Regions of such negative value are provable to be \\"small\\": they cannot extend to compact regions larger than a few , and hence disappear in the classical limit. They are shielded by the uncertainty principle, which does not allow precise localization within phase- space regions smaller than , and thus renders such \\"negative probabilities\\" less paradoxical. If the left side of the equation is to be interpreted as an expectation value in the Hilbert space with respect to an operator, then in the context of quantum optics this equation is known as the optical equivalence theorem. (For details on the properties and interpretation of the Wigner function, see its main article.) An alternative phase-space approach to quantum mechanics seeks to define a wave function (not just a quasiprobability density) on phase space, typically by means of the Segal–Bargmann transform. To be compatible with the uncertainty principle, the phase-space wave function cannot be an arbitrary function, or else it could be localized into an arbitrarily small region of phase space. Rather, the Segal–Bargmann transform is a holomorphic function of x + ip. There is a quasiprobability density associated to the phase-space wave function; it is the Husimi Q representation of the position wave function. Star product The fundamental noncommutative binary operator in the phase space formulation that replaces the standard operator multiplication is the star product, represented by the symbol ★. Each representation of the phase-space distribution has a different characteristic star product. For concreteness, we restrict this discussion to the star product relevant to the Wigner-Weyl representation. For notational convenience, we introduce the notion of left and right derivatives. For a pair of functions f and g, the left and right derivatives are defined as : \\\\begin{align} f \\\\overleftarrow {\\\\partial}_x g & = \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x} \\\\cdot g \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] f \\\\overrightarrow{\\\\partial}_x g & = f \\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\partial g}{\\\\partial x}. \\\\end{align} The differential definition of the star product is where the argument of the exponential function can be interpreted as a power series. Additional differential relations allow this to be written in terms of a change in the arguments of f and g: :\\\\begin{align} (f \\\\star g)(x,p) &= f\\\\left(x+\\\\tfrac{i \\\\hbar}{2} \\\\overrightarrow {\\\\partial }_{p} , p - \\\\tfrac{i \\\\hbar}{2} \\\\overrightarrow {\\\\partial }_{x}\\\\right) \\\\cdot g(x,p) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= f(x,p) \\\\cdot g\\\\left(x -\\\\tfrac{i \\\\hbar}{2} \\\\overleftarrow{\\\\partial }_{p} , p + \\\\tfrac{i \\\\hbar}{2} \\\\overleftarrow{\\\\partial }_{x}\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= f\\\\left(x +\\\\tfrac{i \\\\hbar}{2} \\\\overrightarrow{\\\\partial }_p, p\\\\right) \\\\cdot g\\\\left(x -\\\\tfrac{i \\\\hbar}{2} \\\\overleftarrow{\\\\partial }_p, p\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= f\\\\left(x , p - \\\\tfrac{i \\\\hbar}{2} \\\\overrightarrow{\\\\partial }_x\\\\right) \\\\cdot g\\\\left(x , p + \\\\tfrac{i \\\\hbar}{2}\\\\overleftarrow{\\\\partial }_x\\\\right). \\\\end{align} It is also possible to define the ★-product in a convolution integral form, essentially through the Fourier transform: :(f \\\\star g)(x,p) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi^2 \\\\hbar^2} \\\\, \\\\int f(x+x',p+p') \\\\, g(x+x,p+p) \\\\, \\\\exp{\\\\left(\\\\tfrac{2i}{\\\\hbar}(x'p-xp')\\\\right)} \\\\, dx' dp' dx dp ~. (Thus, e.g., Gaussians compose hyperbolically, : \\\\exp \\\\left (-{a } (x^2+p^2)\\\\right ) ~ \\\\star ~ \\\\exp \\\\left (-{b} (x^2+p^2)\\\\right ) = {1\\\\over 1+\\\\hbar^2 ab} \\\\exp \\\\left (-{a+b\\\\over 1+\\\\hbar^2 ab} (x^2+p^2)\\\\right ) , or : \\\\delta (x) ~ \\\\star ~ \\\\delta(p) = {2\\\\over h} \\\\exp \\\\left (2i{xp\\\\over\\\\hbar}\\\\right ) , etc.) The energy eigenstate distributions are known as stargenstates, ★-genstates, stargenfunctions, or ★-genfunctions, and the associated energies are known as stargenvalues or ★-genvalues. These are solved, analogously to the time- independent Schrödinger equation, by the ★-genvalue equation, where is the Hamiltonian, a plain phase-space function, most often identical to the classical Hamiltonian. Time evolution The time evolution of the phase space distribution is given by a quantum modification of Liouville flow. This formula results from applying the Wigner transformation to the density matrix version of the quantum Liouville equation, the von Neumann equation. In any representation of the phase space distribution with its associated star product, this is :\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial t} = - \\\\frac{1}{i \\\\hbar} \\\\left(f \\\\star H - H \\\\star f \\\\right), or, for the Wigner function in particular, :\\\\frac{\\\\partial W}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\\\\\{\\\\\\\\{W,H\\\\\\\\}\\\\\\\\} = -\\\\frac{2}{\\\\hbar} W \\\\sin \\\\left ( {\\\\frac{\\\\hbar }{2} (\\\\overset{\\\\leftarrow}{\\\\partial_x} \\\\overset{\\\\rightarrow}{\\\\partial_p}-\\\\overset{\\\\leftarrow}{\\\\partial_p}\\\\overset{\\\\rightarrow}{\\\\partial_x})} \\\\right ) \\\\ H =-\\\\\\\\{W,H\\\\\\\\} + O(\\\\hbar^2), where is the Moyal bracket, the Wigner transform of the quantum commutator, while { , } is the classical Poisson bracket. This yields a concise illustration of the correspondence principle: this equation manifestly reduces to the classical Liouville equation in the limit ħ → 0. In the quantum extension of the flow, however, the density of points in phase space is not conserved; the probability fluid appears \\"diffusive\\" and compressible. The concept of quantum trajectory is therefore a delicate issue here. See the movie for the Morse potential, below, to appreciate the nonlocality of quantum phase flow. N.B. Given the restrictions placed by the uncertainty principle on localization, Niels Bohr vigorously denied the physical existence of such trajectories on the microscopic scale. By means of formal phase-space trajectories, the time evolution problem of the Wigner function can be rigorously solved using the path-integral method and the method of quantum characteristics, although there are severe practical obstacles in both cases. Examples=Simple harmonic oscillator The Wigner quasiprobability distribution for the simple harmonic oscillator with a) n = 0, b) n = 1, and c) n = 5. The Hamiltonian for the simple harmonic oscillator in one spatial dimension in the Wigner-Weyl representation is ::H=\\\\frac{1}{2}m \\\\omega^2 x^2 + \\\\frac{p^2}{2m}. The ★-genvalue equation for the static Wigner function then reads :\\\\begin{align} H \\\\star W = {} & \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2} m \\\\omega^2 x^2 + \\\\frac{p^2}{2m}\\\\right) \\\\star W \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[4pt] = {} & \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2}m \\\\omega^2 \\\\left( x+\\\\frac{i \\\\hbar}{2} \\\\stackrel{\\\\rightarrow }{\\\\partial }_{p} \\\\right)^2 + \\\\frac{1}{2m}\\\\left(p - \\\\frac{i \\\\hbar}{2} \\\\stackrel{\\\\rightarrow }{\\\\partial }_x \\\\right)^2\\\\right) ~ W\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[4pt] = {} & \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{2}m \\\\omega^2 \\\\left(x^2 - \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{4} \\\\stackrel{\\\\rightarrow }{\\\\partial }_p^2 \\\\right) + \\\\frac{1}{2m}\\\\left( p^2 -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{4} \\\\stackrel{\\\\rightarrow }{\\\\partial }_x^2 \\\\right) \\\\right) ~ W\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[4pt] & {} + \\\\frac{i \\\\hbar}{2} \\\\left(m \\\\omega^2 x \\\\stackrel{\\\\rightarrow }{\\\\partial }_p - \\\\frac{p}{m} \\\\stackrel{\\\\rightarrow }{\\\\partial }_{x}\\\\right) ~ W \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[4pt] = {} & E \\\\cdot W. \\\\end{align} Consider, first, the imaginary part of the ★-genvalue equation, ::\\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2} \\\\left(m \\\\omega^2 x \\\\stackrel{\\\\rightarrow}{\\\\partial_p} - \\\\frac{p}{m} \\\\stackrel{\\\\rightarrow}{\\\\partial_x}\\\\right) \\\\cdot W=0 This implies that one may write the ★-genstates as functions of a single argument, ::W(x,p)=F\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2} m \\\\omega^2 x^2 + \\\\frac{p^2}{2m}\\\\right)\\\\equiv F(u). With this change of variables, it is possible to write the real part of the ★-genvalue equation in the form of a modified Laguerre equation (not Hermite's equation!), the solution of which involves the Laguerre polynomials as :F_n(u) = \\\\frac{(-1)^n}{\\\\pi \\\\hbar} L_n\\\\left(4\\\\frac{u}{\\\\hbar \\\\omega}\\\\right) e^{-2u/\\\\hbar \\\\omega} ~, introduced by Groenewold in his paper, with associated ★-genvalues ::E_n = \\\\hbar \\\\omega \\\\left(n+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\right)~. For the harmonic oscillator, the time evolution of an arbitrary Wigner distribution is simple. An initial evolves by the above evolution equation driven by the oscillator Hamiltonian given, by simply rigidly rotating in phase space, :W(x,p;t)=W(m\\\\omega x \\\\cos \\\\omega t - p \\\\sin \\\\omega t , ~ p \\\\cos \\\\omega t + \\\\omega m x \\\\sin \\\\omega t ;0) ~. Typically, a \\"bump\\" (or coherent state) of energy can represent a macroscopic quantity and appear like a classical object rotating uniformly in phase space, a plain mechanical oscillator (see the animated figures). Integrating over all phases (starting positions at t = 0) of such objects, a continuous \\"palisade\\", yields a time-independent configuration similar to the above static ★-genstates , an intuitive visualization of the classical limit for large action systems. Free particle angular momentum Suppose a particle is initially in a minimally uncertain Gaussian state, with the expectation values of position and momentum both centered at the origin in phase space. The Wigner function for such a state propagating freely is :W(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{p};t)=\\\\frac{1}{(\\\\pi \\\\hbar)^3} \\\\exp{\\\\left( -\\\\alpha^2 r^2 - \\\\frac{p^2}{\\\\alpha^2 \\\\hbar^2}\\\\left(1+\\\\left(\\\\frac{t}{\\\\tau}\\\\right)^2\\\\right) + \\\\frac{2t}{\\\\hbar \\\\tau} \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{p}\\\\right)} ~, where α is a parameter describing the initial width of the Gaussian, and . Initially, the position and momenta are uncorrelated. Thus, in 3 dimensions, we expect the position and momentum vectors to be twice as likely to be perpendicular to each other as parallel. However, the position and momentum become increasingly correlated as the state evolves, because portions of the distribution farther from the origin in position require a larger momentum to be reached: asymptotically, :W \\\\longrightarrow \\\\frac{1}{(\\\\pi\\\\hbar)^3}\\\\exp\\\\left[-\\\\alpha^2\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{p}t}{m}\\\\right)^2\\\\right]\\\\,. (This relative \\"squeezing\\" reflects the spreading of the free wave packet in coordinate space.) Indeed, it is possible to show that the kinetic energy of the particle becomes asymptotically radial only, in agreement with the standard quantum-mechanical notion of the ground-state nonzero angular momentum specifying orientation independence:J. P. Dahl and W. P. Schleich, \\"Concepts of radial and angular kinetic energies\\", Phys. Rev. A,65 (2002). :K_\\\\text{rad}=\\\\frac{\\\\alpha^2 \\\\hbar^2}{2m}\\\\left(\\\\frac{3}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{1+(t/\\\\tau)^2}\\\\right) :K_\\\\text{ang}=\\\\frac{\\\\alpha^2 \\\\hbar^2}{2m}\\\\frac{1}{1+(t/\\\\tau)^2}~. Morse potential The Morse potential is used to approximate the vibrational structure of a diatomic molecule. Wigner function time-evolution of the Morse potential U(x) = 20(1 − e−0.16x)2 in atomic units (a.u.). The solid lines represent level set of the Hamiltonian H(x, p) = p2/2 + U(x). Quantum tunneling Tunneling is a hallmark quantum effect where a quantum particle, not having sufficient energy to fly above, still goes through a barrier. This effect does not exist in classical mechanics. Wigner function for tunneling through the potential barrier U(x) = 8e−0.25x2 in atomic units (a.u.). The solid lines represent the level set of the Hamiltonian H(x, p) = p2/2 + U(x). Quartic potential Wigner function time evolution for the potential U(x) = 0.1x4 in atomic units (a.u.). The solid lines represent the level set of the Hamiltonian H(x, p) = p2/2 + U(x). Schrödinger cat state Wigner function of two interfering coherent states evolving through the SHO Hamiltonian. The corresponding momentum and coordinate projections are plotted to the right and under the phase space plot.

It was written and produced by series creator and executive producer Kyle Killen, and was directed by Sarah Pia Anderson. \\"Kate Is Enough\\" was well received by television critics, who praised its storylines. Commentators noted that the script was well written and that the episode was \\"enjoyable\\". Upon airing, the episode garnered 4.73 million viewers in the United States and a 1.2 rating in the 18–49 demographic, according to Nielsen ratings. It ranked second in its timeslot of the night, behind The Mentalist on CBS. The show centers on Michael Britten (Jason Isaacs), a police detective living in two separate realities after a car accident. In this episode, Michael deals with a case where a girl is found after on a hotel top in which she was pushed or jumped from. He sees Kate Porter (Brianna Brown) in both realities, after her sister died. In one life, Kate is a successful investment banker, while in the other she is a cocaine addict. Meanwhile, Rex's (Dylan Minnette) racket is broken by his best friend Cole (Logan Miller), which was an accident. Rex is angry because it belonged to his mother, Hannah (Laura Allen).  Plot  The episode opens with Rex (Dylan Minnette) and his best friend Cole (Logan Miller) fighting over a tennis racquet, which Cole broke, which was Hannah's before the car accident. Rex's tennis coach Tara (Michaela McManus) tries to stop the fight, but Rex had accidentally hit her in the face. Michael (Jason Isaacs), Rex's father, is called to the school, when Rex tells Michael and Tara that he quit. He is very emotional due to Hannah's (Laura Allen) death, according to Dr. Judith Evans (Cherry Jones). Later in the \\"red reality\\", Efrem Vega (Wilmer Valderrama), Michael's partner in the reality, and Michael are called on a new case at a hotel room, where a woman falls into a lake from the hotel. They speak to Cameron Fuller (Eddie Matos) and Darin Knox (Eric Lange) about the case. Fuller and Knox noted that they Fuller dumped the lady, and she was \\"making a fool of herself\\", because she was so drunk. Fuller thought that he \\"shouldn't have left her alone\\". Soon after, as they walking away, Michael sees Rex's former babysitter Kate Porter (Brianna Brown). Michael doesn't introduce Vega to her. Later in his \\"green reality\\", Bird (Steve Harris), Michael's partner in this reality, works on a case where a man named Charlie Simmons, who is known to party and take drugs, was murdered. They speak to Dora (Angela Elayne Gibbs) about the case, she leads them to Kate Porter's house in the \\"green reality\\". Rather than a successful investment banker, she is a drug addict. She gets some papers and inhales cocaine up her nose in front of the detectives. Dr. Jonathan Lee (BD Wong) noted that the \\"red reality\\" is real because she shows up in that world first, and in the other the next day. Dr. Evans helps Michael with the case in the \\"green reality\\", while Lee insisted that the picture Evans noted is fake. Michael and Hannah speak about Kate in the \\"red reality\\", when he finds out that her sister had died earlier. Michael thinks that she must be on the cocaine because of that. He shows Rex what they use to do together, Rex is depressed and mad, while Rex walks off claiming that he is studying for a Spanish test at school. Later, they go to a man's house who has a video camera at his house. This helps Michael with the case in the \\"green reality\\". Vega and Michael continue on the case, and Michael goes to the house. Vega says nothing is there, while Michael thinks to his \\"green reality\\", and looks in the bathroom for evidence, which was shaving cream in the cabinet. They speak to Cameron Fuller and Darin Knox, who committed the crime. Evidence was that a drink was dropped on the person who had fallen in the lake. Soon after, Dr. Wild finds evidence from the camera that Kate and her friend had done the crime. She finally confesses to it. They speak in both realities about the story of how it came to the current life. Michael speaks to Rex, again. Rex claimed that he was mad because the racquet was Hannah's, and that it helped him deal with her death in the \\"green reality\\". Rex goes to the tennis court and apologized to Cole who forgives him.  Production  Series creator and executive producer Kyle Killen (pictured) wrote and produced the episode. The episode was written and produced by series creator and executive producer Kyle Killen, and was directed by Sarah Pia Anderson; it was Killen's third writing credit, after previously writing \\"The Little Guy\\", the second episode aired on March 8, 2012. It was Anderson's first directing credit on the series. This is the only episode that aired out of production order, with the production code being \\"1ATR08\\", but aired fourth due to NBC's decision to change the broadcasting order. It was teasingly suggested that Isaacs prove his devotion to Kermode and Mayo's Film Review by having his character say \\"ukulele\\" onscreen, which was a case of \\"Challenge accepted!\\" The line, \\"He's not going to be playing the ukulele in heaven\\", was uttered, while examining a corpse whose fingers had been badly mangled. \\"When I did that I got a note from the editing room going, 'What the f— are you talking about?'\\" says the actor. \\"I said, 'You have to keep the line in. If I can ever wield my big stick as a producer, I'm telling you I want the ukulele line left in!'\\" The line was kept in the episode.  Casting  The episode guest performances from Logan Miller, who was cast as Cole, Rex's best friend. Chris McGarry as Dr. Banks. Brianna Brown, as Kate Porter, who was Rex's former babysitter, Eric Lange, who played as Darin Knox, Eddie Matos as Cameron Fuller. Geoff Meed as Mark Hudson.

Gabriel Wyath (Billy Lush) is the one causing the situation. He demands to see his sister Christie. However, she was murdered in a dispute with an ex- boyfriend. Gabriel created a separate world where she was not murdered, but rather kidnapped by Dr. Wild. Later, Dr. Lee explains what they are dealing with. Gabriel allows Michael to come in the hospital, but nobody else. Michael enters the building and realizes that he has a \\"dead man switch\\", meaning that if Wyath is shot, then the whole building will blow up. Gabriel goes up near the window to handle a man who is screaming, and the police are prepared to shoot him. However, to prevent Gabriel from using his switch, Michael jumps at him, causing him to divert his path. Gabriel knocks him out, and shortly after injects him with ketamine. Michael suddenly wakes up in his \\"green reality\\". Michael is looking for a ring, which is Dr. Wild's. He sees a hallucination of a penguin, caused by the drugs. The penguin tells him that Rex has the ring. He calls him down, and Rex reveals that he stole it for his girlfriend, Emma (Daniela Bobadilla). Michael meets Emma and gets the ring back. Dr. Evans (Cherry Jones) claims that he is \\"having a nightmare about madness\\". He wakes up in the \\"red reality\\" and sees Dr. Lee helping him. The police are coming in to shoot him.

Written by Leonard Chang and co-executive producer Davey Holmes, \\"Nightswimming\\" was watched by 2.8 million viewers, including 0.9 percent of those aged between 18 and 49 in Nielsen ratings, upon its initial broadcast in the United States. Directed by executive producer Jeffrey Reiner, this episode received generally mixed reviews. Awake centers on Michael Britten (Jason Isaacs), a detective living in two separate realities after a car crash. In one reality, in which he wears a red wristband, his wife Hannah (Laura Allen) survived the crash, and in another reality, in which he wears a green wristband, his son Rex (Dylan Minnette) survived. In this episode, Michael helps Accountant Marcus Ananyev (Elijah Alexander) and his wife Alina (Ayelet Zurer) start a new life in the Witness Protection Program after a gang member attempts to kill Marcus in the \\"green reality\\". In the \\"red reality\\", Michael and Hannah prepare for a new life in Oregon after deciding to move there. They go swimming at a college pool to celebrate their love. Many commentators praised the storylines of the \\"red reality\\", but criticized the arcs of the \\"green reality\\". This episode marked the first absence of Rex, as well as the show's two therapists: Dr. Jonathan Lee (BD Wong) and Dr. Judith Evans (Cherry Jones). Although it was the eighth broadcast episode, it was scheduled to be the fifth episode. The music featured in this installment was by Otis Redding. Michael is seen shirtless in two scenes of this episode, one of which was filmed at an actual campus swimming pool. During filming, a woman who was near the swimming pool confronted Isaacs about his nudity. Several of the episode's themes have been critically examined. It was filmed in Los Angeles, California, while eight guest actors starred in this episode.  Plot = Background  The Brittens are involved in a fatal car crash. As a result, Michael, a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) detective, begins to live in two separate realities. In one reality, in which he wears a red wristband, his wife Hannah (Laura Allen) survives the crash, and in the other reality, in which he wears a green wristband, his son Rex (Dylan Minnette) survives. Michael does not know which reality is real, and uses the wristbands to differentiate the two. Michael sees two separate therapists: Dr. Jonathan Lee (BD Wong) in the \\"red reality\\", and Dr. Judith Evans (Cherry Jones) in the \\"green reality\\". Meanwhile, in the \\"red reality\\", Michael and Hannah continue with their plan to move to Oregon. Michael works with Detective Isaiah \\"Bird\\" Freeman (Steve Harris) in the \\"green reality\\" and with Detective Efrem Vega (Wilmer Valderrama) in the \\"red reality\\" after the crash.  Events  In the \\"red reality\\", two police officers are sitting in a car talking when they receive a report of a break-in at a local college swimming pool. They see Michael running naked from the pool and chase him; when they tell him to stop running, Michael identifies himself as a detective. Meanwhile, in the \\"green reality\\", Accountant Marcus Ananyev (Elijah Alexander) exits his house and makes a phone call. Marcus then walks over to his car and tries to start it, but notices a bomb in the car's engine and runs away shortly before it explodes. Soon after, at the police station, Michael and Bird tell Marcus that they will protect him. Marcus' wife, Alina (Ayelet Zurer), comes into the station, where Marcus explains what has happened. Shortly after talking with Marcus and Alina, Michael and Bird take the couple to a hotel for temporary shelter. In the \\"red reality\\", Michael notices Hannah cleaning up and packing items before they move to Oregon. Soon after, Michael takes Vega to meet his confidential informant (CI), Jake (Steve Lawrence), with whom he will work after Michael leaves. Jake does not want to work with Vega for an unknown reason, but gives the pair a tip about a warehouse. That night, Michael, Vega and the SWAT team watch the warehouse but no one shows up; Vega wonders if Jake had given incorrect information. Back in the \\"green reality\\", Michael goes to the hotel, since Alina had left in the middle of the night. Once there, Marcus warns Michael and Bird that if they do not find her, Marcus will give himself up to Maxim Basayev, his mobster boss. Back at the station, after looking at evidence, Michael decides to talk to the hotel staff where Alina and Marcus are staying, with Bird, rather than Alina's friends. Later, Michael and Bird go to the home of Greg Hollander (Ron Melendez), one of Alina's friends, but do not find Greg, the person they would like to question regarding Alina's whereabouts. Hollander, who is tied up, kicks down a table as the detectives leave, notifying the cops that he is in there. As the criminals run away, Bird and Michael break into the house; Bird and Michael enter the house, while Bird shoots the two gang members. After that, they speak to Greg, who tells them that Alina constantly talks about how she and her husband have grown apart. Michael goes to search for Alina at a beach and finds her there. The two talk about Marcus and everything that happened previously. Michael explains that she has a chance to start over and takes her back to the hotel. In the \\"red reality\\", at Jake's home, Jake says he and Vega can have dinner alone to get to know each other. That night, Michael and Hannah go nude swimming at the college pool.

Although it was the eighth broadcast episode, it was scheduled to be the fifth episode, until NBC decided to change the broadcasting order. The entry's production code was \\"1ATR06\\". \\"Nightswimming\\" marked the first absence of Rex, as well as the show's two therapists: Dr. Lee and Dr. Evans. Eight cast members guest starred in this entry. Actress Laura Innes returned to the episode as Captain Tricia Harper, while Lawrence made his first and only appearance as Jake. Alexander, Zurer, Melendez, Blackman, Holden and Todorov also made their first and only appearances as Marcus, Alina, Hollander, Vasily, Shapiro and Alexander, respectively. This entry featured , a song by Otis Redding, which was played during one of a number of scenes where Michael is seen shirtless. The installment was filmed and set in Los Angeles, California, as were all other Awake episodes. During filming of the installment, Isaacs thought it would be funny to moon down the stairs during a scene in which Hannah and Michael go nude swimming, but stated that it would probably break the Standards and Practices law. Filming of the episode commenced at an actual campus swimming pool for one scene. A lady present during filming asked if Isaacs was naked. Isaacs replied that he was not completely naked, but had a \\"small piece of material taped over [his] genitals\\"; the lady said \\"That's naked,\\" adding \\"I can see your butt crack.\\" In response, Isaacs \\"taped a piece of material over [his] butt crack\\". When the last scene was filmed that day, he ran up the stairs, causing the material—which had been secured only by a piece of sealing tape—to fall off. The woman was \\"furious\\". Isaacs thought that the team of Awake would have to withdraw the footage, but was happy to see that part was included in the finished episode.  Themes  alt=A man with short black hair and a black shirt, who is smiling. Although it did not directly impact the ongoing storyline of Awake, \\"Nightswimming\\" introduced and continued key thematic elements of the series. It was described as a \\"long, roundabout\\" episode that is \\"bent on making [Michael] fully commit to moving to Oregon with Hannah\\" by Matt Fowler from IGN. Fowler thought that, since Rex was not in the episode, the \\"green reality\\" seemed more like a dream. In a review of the following episode, \\"Game Day\\", he admitted that he thought Alina was behind Marcus' car bomb, since he thought that this story would have an arrest by the end. Writing for HitFix, Alan Sepinwall opined that Michael is \\"coming to grips with Hannah's desire to move because he loves her that much\\". However, the Brittens later decided not to move in \\"Slack Water\\", the series' tenth episode, owing to personal concerns. Sepinwall noted that he could see \\"the obvious parallels to Michael's personal situation\\" in this installment, while The A.V. Club editor Zack Handlen said that Awake \\"continues to connect routine procedural storylines and find new ways to give them deeper meaning\\". Screen Rant writer Kevin Yeoman said that this episode was about \\"bringing two people who have drifted apart back together\\" and that \\"Nightswimming\\" has \\"balanced the series' larger mystery with grief and a twinge of optimism\\" on a \\"smaller scale\\" compared to other entries of the program. He claimed that the installment was designed to \\"introduce us to what makes Hannah and Michael so special\\", adding that \\"For most of the series, there hasn't been much chemistry between the two\\". In his real reality check, a prediction on which reality is real by the end of the particular episode, Nick McHatton, a TV Fanatic writer, chose the \\"red reality\\", because it was \\"nice to see why Hannah and Michael love each other\\", while Handlen claimed that \\"the show has done a fine job at largely standalone episodes\\", but each episode \\"feels like its own separate story\\". He assumed that \\"there's little feel of rising intensity or greater danger\\", \\"given the hints of conspiracy and the ever intensifying threat of Oregon\\". Caroline Preece of Den of Geek initially assumed \\"this random nakedness will tie in to the show's central mythology\\", though she later found out Michael was just swimming nude with Hannah. Preece thought that Hannah and Michael \\"reconnected\\" in the episode, as did McHatton. Due to Rex's absence, she thought that this episode allowed viewers to get to know Hannah.  Broadcast and reception  \\"Nightswimming\\" originally aired on NBC on April 19, 2012, and was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on Sky Atlantic on June 22, 2012. According to Nielsen ratings, an audience measurement system that determine the audience size and composition of television programming, the episode's initial broadcast in the United States was viewed by approximately 2.8 million viewers and earned a 0.9 rating/2 percent share in the 18–49 demographic, meaning that it was seen by 0.9 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds and 2 percent of 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. In the United Kingdom, the episode obtained 287,000 viewers, making it the second most-viewed program for that channel behind Hit & Miss. Note: Information is in the section titled \\"w/e 24 Jun 2012\\", listed under Sky Atlantic alt=A teenage boy is standing up, with his arms crossed. This episode received generally mixed reviews from critics. Sepinwall was disappointed with the overall storyline of the \\"green reality\\"; he claimed that if the episode was only based on the \\"red reality\\", the entry would have been \\"perfectly fine\\". Meanwhile, Handlen thought that if the arcs of the \\"red reality\\" were not included in this installment, it would not work as an episode. While Sepinwall called the \\"green reality\\" storyline \\"boring\\", Handlen thought that the storylines of Marcus and Alina did not \\"matter\\"; according to Handlen, the episode should not have gotten into the details of the guest stars. Sepinwall and Handlen were disappointed that Rex did not appear in the episode; Handlen praised Rex, calling him a \\"likable teenage boy\\" who deserves more running time. Handlen thought that Michael sounded \\"reasonable\\", and Sepinwall said \\"Awake...[has previously done] a good job of making the guest characters involved in [Michael]'s cases interesting enough that I care about what happens in each investigation.\\" He thought that until this episode the writers had been wise on guest stars and on not focusing on them too much; he also wrote that actors Lawrence and Valderrama did not seem to match each other. Handlen was rather impressed with the storylines of the \\"red reality\\" and gave the episode a \\"B+\\", writing that \\"Jake reminded [him] of Al Pacino's aging [gang member] in Donnie Brasco.\\" Sepinwall liked Jake's actor, Lawrence, praising his appearance on the Awake episode. Fowler showed disappointment as the entry gave no \\"twists\\" or \\"problems\\" regarding Michael, or his therapy sessions. He compared \\"Nightswimming\\" to other Awake episodes, claiming that other entries offer more \\"plot\\" and \\"emotional\\" problems, while Preece called the entry \\"strange\\". She thought that the storylines of the \\"red reality\\" were more \\"interesting\\" than the \\"green reality\\" storylines, and Fowler was disappointed with the song choice for the installment, claiming that the R.E.M. song \\"Nightswimming\\" should have been played instead. Preece described the \\"Nightswimming\\" episode as a \\"dull procedural episode\\" that is devoid of any mythology or forward motion; she called the installment \\"flat\\". Despite saying that she was \\"losing patience\\" with Awake, Preece said that she was still \\"keen\\" to see more. While Preece wrote that the episode was missing key elements from previous episodes, Fowler criticized the installment, since the first fifteen minutes of the entry were about Marcus and Elena and their lives. Despite this, Fowler praised the final scene of the episode, and Preece called Michael and Hannah's relationship \\"lovely\\". Fowler gave this a \\"7.5\\" \\"good\\" rating, the lowest score for an Awake episode at that time. Preece thought that the episode made \\"little mistakes\\", which Awake could not afford to make. McHatton said that \\"Nightswimming\\" contains \\"No conspiracies, no killers, not even murders\\", just a \\"procedural case that mirrored [Michael]'s life at home\\". Despite this, he praised Michael and Hannah's relationship, claiming that \\"it's nice to watch as they reconnect with each other\\"; he gave it a \\"4.5\\" rating out of \\"5.0\\".

Critics were largely positive in their reviews of the installment. Awake centers on Michael Britten (Jason Isaacs), a detective living in two separate realities after a car accident. In one reality, in which he wears a red wristband, his wife Hannah (Laura Allen) survived the accident, and in another reality, in which he wears a green wristband, his son Rex (Dylan Minnette) survived. In this episode, Michael and Isaiah \\"Bird\\" Freeman (Steve Harris) are investigating what seems to be a case of gang violence.

This episode marked the second absence of Rex, as well as the show's two therapists: Dr. Jonathan Lee (BD Wong) and Dr. Judith Evans (Cherry Jones). It was filmed in Los Angeles, California, while sixteen guest actors starred in this episode. Plot=Background The Brittens are involved in a fatal car accident. As a result, Michael, a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) detective, begins to live in two separate realities. In one reality, in which he wears a red wristband, his wife Hannah (Laura Allen) survives the accident, and in the other reality, in which he wears a green wristband, his son Rex (Dylan Minnette) survives. Michael does not know which reality is real, and uses the wristbands to differentiate the two. Michael sees two separate therapists: Dr. Jonathan Lee (BD Wong) in the \\"red reality\\", and Dr. Judith Evans (Cherry Jones) in the \\"green reality\\". Meanwhile, in the \\"red reality\\", Michael and Hannah continue with their plan to move to Oregon. Michael works with Detective Isaiah \\"Bird\\" Freeman (Steve Harris) in the \\"green reality\\" and with Detective Efrem Vega (Wilmer Valderrama) in the \\"red reality\\" after the accident. Events In the \\"red reality\\", Michael informs Hannah of Emma's (Daniela Bobadilla) pregnancy with Rex's baby. Pondering Emma's plans of raising the baby, Michael and Hannah conclude that they need to take part. Meanwhile, Michael awakens in the \\"green reality\\", and is assigned with Bird to the shooting of a drug dealer, Dion Driggs. Bird opines that the shooter broke in, killed the dealer, and ran off with his drugs, computer, and EVO Smart Console. Michael and Bird then realize that the shooter also took the life of Maya King, a seasoned resident. Back in the \\"red reality\\", Vega alerts Michael that he will not be hosting a farewell party for him, and Tricia Harper (Laura Innes) informs the two that gun and drug dealer, Simpson Trujillo has arrived in Los Angeles. Harper returns home where Carl Kessel (Mark Harelik) alerts her of his inability to relocate his heroin. Hannah and Michael visit Angela (Kelly Wolf) and Joaquin (Carlos Lacámara), Emma's parents, who inform them that the baby will be put up for closed adoption; Hannah deems Emma to not be at peace with her parents' decision. Back in the \\"green reality\\", Michael and Bird travel to a pawnshop; the shooter sold the drug dealer's possessions here. The shop's owner (Leonard Kelly-Young) provides them with the shooter's address and name, Perry Jenkins (Patrick Cox). The two capture Jenkins, but he denies having commit a crime; they believe him. Meanwhile, in the \\"red reality\\", Emma meets Hannah at a bookstore, and informs her that she does in fact want to give the baby up for adoption. During the celebration of Vega prosecuting Trujillo, Michael notices that the latter's house is synonymous with the one in Driggs' video game. In the evidence room, Michael speaks with username 'SVENgali69' (Thor Knai), a player of the video game. After coming to the conclusion that Driggs' prerogative was to kill King, Bird talks to her friend Miss Pearl (Phyllis Applegate). Production \\"Slack Water\\" was written by staff writer Noelle Valdivia, her third writing credit for the series. She previously co-wrote episode six, \\"That's Not My Penguin\\", with series creator Kyle Killen, and later co-wrote the story for the series finale, \\"Turtles All the Way Down\\". The episode was directed by Nick Gomez, his only directing credit for the series. Broadcast and reception \\"Slack Water\\" originally aired on NBC on May 3, 2012, and was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on Sky Atlantic on July 1, 2012.

Note: Information is in the section titled \\"w/e 1 July 2012\\", listed under Sky Atlantic Laura Innes' performance was critically acclaimed. Writing for HitFix, Alan Sepinwall deemed a scene from the previous episode, \\"Game Day\\", \\"more powerful\\" than Emma's storyline in \\"Slack Water\\". He called the personal and police stories in this episode \\"predictable\\", adding: \\"It was clear, for instance, that Hannah was right and the other adults were wrong about what Emma wanted.\\" Speaking of the guest stars, Sepinwall praised Innes' \\"excellent\\" performance, calling it \\"the episode's strongest moment\\". He also appreciated the cultural reference to The X-Files, but observed that \\"none of the episode titles shown were from actual X-Files installments\\". The A.V. Club Zack Handlen was largely critical of the episode, but commented that Bobadilla portrays Emma well, saying she is \\"low-key and pleasant\\". Despite this, Handlen was not appreciative of the character's pregnancy plot, because it was handled in a \\"crass or blatantly exploitative way\\". He was critical of the shooter storyline, calling it a \\"bland, utterly impersonal murder mystery which basically wraps up ten minutes early and then has to play for time.\\" Handlen appreciated the reference to The X-Files as well, and concluded of the episode: \\"While 'Slack Water' was well-acted, and had some well-observed exchanges, it came off as flat in the worst possible way, exposing not just the flaws in its own script, but the potentially insurmountable difficulties which face this series in the weeks ahead.\\" Largely positive of the episode, Matt Fowler of IGN opined that Michael's two reality storyline was \\"undiscussed\\", in turn lacking the \\"emotional and thematic connector between the two worlds; making them feel totally separate and not part of an individual's enclosed psyche.\\" While Fowler appreciated the \\"green reality\\" being in a \\"suitable and satisfactory manner\\", he \\"didn't care all that much about [it]\\". He was disappointed with the absence of Michael's \\"thriving\\" therapy sessions in this episode. Fowler was more positive of the \\"red reality\\"; he too appreciated the character of Emma, though he found her moving in with the Brittens \\"wonky\\". He concluded that he liked the \\"ambient, new- agey\\" background music, and said \\"while 'Slack Water' was a good episode, it also wasn't the best that this show can do\\". Writing for Screen Rant, Kevin Yeoman enjoyed this episode more than the previous one; he opined that \\"Slack Water\\" puts an emphasis on characters. Despite this, he commented that the episode felt \\"dull\\" due to the \\"noticeable absence of not only Rex, but also Dr. Lee (B.D. Wong) and Dr. Evans (Cherry Jones)\\". Yeoman wrote, overall: \\"Even though the last two weeks have felt strangely sub par with the rest of the season, the episodes themselves have remained entertaining in large part to the fantastic performances of everyone involved – though special consideration must go to Isaacs and Allen, for obvious reasons.\\" Nick McHatton of TV Fanatic gave the episode 4.0 stars out of 5.0, and said \\"Slack Water\\" was \\"one of the poorer episodes\\", calling the \\"green reality\\" \\"underwhelming\\" and the \\"red reality\\" \\"awkward\\". Den of Geek Caroline Preece was highly critical of the episode, writing: \\"The central mystery has all but ironed out by the show's events and producer's comments, and the character of Michael has become little more than a casual observer of his own life.\\" Preece opined that this episode may have led to the show's cancellation, though she appreciated the acting, adding: \\"While I think the acting on the show is quite fabulous, and the weekly case as good as the best police procedurals on TV, the use of the show's unique dual reality format has been underwhelming, and the unfolding of its mystery far too slow.\\" Preece was also more positive of the \\"red reality\\", though she was \\"not entirely sure where the writers are heading with [the pregnancy] storyline\\".

It explains the origin in the Nahuan languages of the phoneme which is not found in any of the other languages of the Uto-Aztecan family. The existence of in Nahuatl had puzzled previous linguists and caused Edward Sapir to reconstruct a phoneme for Proto-Uto-Aztecan based only on evidence from Aztecan. In a 1937 paper published in the journal American Anthropologist, Whorf argued that phoneme was a result of some of the Nahuan or Aztecan languages having undergone a sound change changing the original */t/ to in the position before */a/. The sound law has come to be known as \\"Whorf's law\\" and is still considered valid, although a more detailed understanding of the precise conditions under which it took place has been developed. The situation had been obscured by the fact that often the */a/ had then subsequently been lost or changed to another vowel, making it difficult to realize what had conditioned the change. Because some Nahuan languages have /t/ and others have , Whorf thought that the law had been limited to certain dialects and that the dialects that had /t/ were more conservative. In 1978, Lyle Campbell and Ronald Langacker showed that in fact, Whorf's law had affected all of the Nahuan languages and that some dialects had subsequently changed to /l/ or back to /t/, but it remains evident that the language went through a /tɬ/ stage. In 1996, Alexis Manaster Ramer showed that the sound change had in fact also happened before the Proto-Uto-Aztecan high central vowel *//, not just before */a/. Today, the best known Nahuan language is Nahuatl.

Its use started even before the creation of Pakistan, during the later phase of the Pakistan Movement. The slogan became a battle cry and greeting for the Muslim League, which was struggling for an independent country for the Muslims of South Asia, when World War II ended and the independence movement geared up. During the partition the slogan was shouted when trains transporting Muslims entered Pakistan. Pakistan Zindabad is the national slogan of Pakistan. Etymology The slogan is a use of the standard Urdu and Persian suffix Zindabad (Long Live) that is placed after a person or a country name. It is used to express victory, patriotism or as a prayer. In literal translation, Pakistan Zindabad means \\"Long Live Pakistan\\"; it also is rendered as \\"Victory to Pakistan\\". History The Pakistan Zindabad slogan was first raised during the Pakistan Movement. Muslims at that time often wrote the slogan on handkerchiefs or pillowcases. The slogan was equally heard as Jai Hind during a visit by a British parliamentary delegation led by Robert Richards to Delhi, after the British government decided to leave India. On 23 December 1940, the Bihar Muslim Student Federation passed a resolution to adopt Pakistan Zindabad as their national slogan at every meeting, conference or gathering. In 1941, during the days of the Pakistan Movement, Muhammad Ali Jinnah on a visit to Ootacamund was received by a crowd of Muslims chanting Pakistan Zindabad; among them was a young boy of about 10 years age, who was scantily clothed. Jinnah called him and asked, \\"You were shouting Pakistan Zindabad, what do you know about Pakistan?\\" The boy replied, \\"I do not know very much about Pakistan. I only know that Pakistan means Muslim rule where many Muslims live, and Hindu rule where Hindus live,\\" to which Jinnah observed that his message had reached the people and remarked that now the struggle for Pakistan was unstoppable. During the fight for an independent Pakistan the cry of Pakistan Zindabad was raised by the locals to welcome the refugees coming to Pakistan. The refugees also raised the cry in jubilation when they crossed the border. The slogans of Pakistan Zindabad and its counterpart, Hindustan Zindabad, notably found negative usage in communal riots associated with the fight for independence. On 14 August 1947, Muhammad Ali Jinnah's motorcade was welcomed by shouts of Pakistan Zindabad, Quaid-e-Azam Zindabad and flower petals all along his way from the Governor General's residence to the Constituent Assembly building and back, where he attended the Proclamation of Independence and a hoisting ceremony of the Pakistan flag. Battle cry In 1947, during the First Kashmir War, an outpost of the Jammu and Kashmir State force that were under the operational control of Indian Army reported cries of Pakistan Zindabad coming from Haji Pir Pass. Assuming that the pass was invaded and occupied by Pakistanis, the Jammu and Kashmir State forces withdrew from the area and burnt a strategically important bridge. They later discovered it was a false alarm; the men were friendly forces of the Indian Army occupying the pass, who were cut off from Poonch after the bridge was blown away.  Notable usage = Political  The Saudi King Abdullah Bin Abdul Aziz in a meeting with Chief of Army Staff Ashfaq Pervez Kayani repeatedly raised the slogan to show his friendship with Pakistan, during his visit to the country in 2009. =Use in India= On 6 July 1948, the Indian Police raided a brass merchant's shop in Moradabad, after being informed that the shop had utensils with \\"Pakistan Zindabad\\" markings on them. During the Muharram Processions in 1956, following communal discord Muslim youths raised the slogan; later in the same year it was heard during a procession organized by students of the Aligarh Muslim University, in protest against a book Religious Leaders published by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan; however, raising of any anti-nationalism slogan was denied by Maulana Abul Kalam Azad in the Indian parliament. The slogan has also been raised in Indian-administered Kashmir continuously.). In 1985, a Kashmiri was detained by the local police on a number of charges including raising of the slogan \\"Pakistan Zindabad\\", which was called an anti-national and provocative slogan. On 13 October 1983, during a limited over cricket match between West Indies and India at Sher-i-Kashmir Stadium, Srinagar, spectators, including a group of spectators consisting of members of the Jamait-Tuleba, the student wing of the Jamaat-e-Islami, cheered India's defeat with cries of Pakistan Zindabad.  National days  *Independence Day slogans – closely related to independence. The slogan is used in speeches and rallies carried out on this day across the world, where Pakistanis celebrate the day.  Sports  *Pakistani cricket matches. The slogan is used during Pakistan's cricket matches to support the team and also in jubilation if the team wins, especially big tournaments; historical examples include the 1992 Cricket World Cup, 2009 ICC World Twenty20.

While the brain has a limited capacity for regeneration, endogenous neural stem cells, as well as numerous pro- regenerative molecules, can participate in replacing and repairing damaged or diseased neurons and glial cells. Another benefit that can be achieved by using endogenous regeneration could be avoiding an immune response from the host. Neural stem cells in the adult brain During the early development of a human, neural stem cells lie in the germinal layer of the developing brain, ventricular and subventricular zones. In brain development, multipotent stem cells (those that can generate different types of cells) are present in these regions, and all of these cells differentiate into neural cell forms, such as neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. A long-held belief states that the multipotency of neural stem cells would be lost in the adult human brain. However, it is only in vitro, using neurosphere and adherent monolayer cultures, that stem cells from the adult mammalian brain have shown mutipotent capacity, while the in vivo study is not convincing. Therefore, the term \\"neural progenitor\\" is used instead of \\"stem cell\\" to describe limited regeneration ability in the adult brain stem cell. Neural stem cells (NSC) reside in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the adult human brain and the dentate gyrus of the adult mammalian hippocampus. Newly formed neurons from these regions participate in learning, memory, olfaction and mood modulation. It has not been definitively determined whether or not these stem cells are multipotents. NSC from the hippocampus of rodents, which can differentiate into dentate granule cells, have developed into many cell types when studied in culture. However, another in vivo study, using NSCs in the postnatal SVZ, showed that the stem cell is restricted to developing into different neuronal sub-type cells in the olfactory bulb. It is believed that the various spatial location niches regulate the differentiation of the neural stem cell. Neurogenesis in the central nervous system Santiago Ramon y Cajal, a neuroscience pioneer, concluded that the generation of neurons occurs only in the prenatal phase of human development, not after birth. This theory had long been the fundamental principle of neuroscience. However, in the mid-20th century, evidence of adult mammalian neurogenesis was found in rodent hippocampus and other region of the brain. In the intact adult mammalian brain, neuroregeneration maintains the function and structure of the central nervous system (CNS). The most adult stem cells in the brain are found in the subventricular zone at the lateral walls of the lateral ventricle. Another region where neurogenesis takes place in the adult brain is the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus. While the exact mechanism that maintains functional NSCs in these regions is still unknown, NSCs have shown an ability to restore neurons and glia in response to certain pathological conditions. However, so far, this regeneration by NSCs is insufficient to restore the full function and structure of an injured brain. However, endogenous neuroregeneration, unlike using embryonic stem cell implantation, is anticipated to treat damaged CNS without immunogenesis or tumorigenesis. Neurogenesis in subgranular zone Progenitor cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus migrate to the nearby location and differentiate into granule cells. As a part of the limbic system, new neurons of the hippocampus maintain the function of controlling mood, learning and memory. In the dentate gyrus, putative stem cells, called type 1 cells, proliferate into type 2 and type 3 cells, which are transiently amplifying, lineage-determined progenitor cells. Type 1 cells in the hippocampus are multipotent in vitro. However, although there is evidence that both new neurons and glia are generated in the hippocampus in vivo, no exact relationship of neurogenesis to type 1 cells is shown. In the hippocampus, newly formed neurons contribute only a small portion to the entire neuron population. These new neurons have different electrophysiology compared to the rest of the existing neurons. This may be evidence that generating new neurons in the SGZ is part of learning and memorizing activity of mammals. Several studies have been performed to explain the relationship between neurogenesis and learning. In the case of learning, that related to the hippocampal function, a significantly increased number of neurons are generated in the SGZ and survival of the new neurons is increased if they are required for retention of memory. In addition to learning and memorizing, neurogenesis in the SGZ is also affected by mood and emotion. With constant, inescapable stress, which usually results in emotional depression, there is a significant decrease in neurogensis, the effect of which can be reversed by treatment with fluoxetine. Neurogenesis in subventricular zone The largest NSC population in the brain is found in the SVZ. The SVZ is considered a micro-environment called a \\"stem cell niche\\" that retains the NSC's capacity of self-renewing and multipotency. Basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), Notch-1, sonic hedgehog (SHH), noggin, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and a soluble carbohydrate-binding protein, Galectin-1, are reported as factors that maintain such properties of NSC in stem cell niche. Like stem cells in SGZ, progenitor cells in SVZ also differentiate into neurons and form an intermediate cell called a transiently amplifying cell (TAC). A recent study revealed that beta-catenin signaling, Wnt β-catenin, regulates the differentiation of TAC. NSCs in the SVZ have a distinct capacity to migrate into the olfactory bulb in the anterior tip of the telencephalon by a pathway called the rostral migratory stream (RMS). This migration is unique to new neurons in the SVZ that embryonic neurogenesis and neurogenesis at other region of the brain are not able to perform. Another unique neurogenesis in the SVZ is neurogenesis by astrocytes. A study done by Doetsch (1999) showed that astrocytes in the SVZ can be dedifferentiate and differentiate into neurons in the olfactory bulb. Among four types of cells in the SVZ (migrating neuroblasts, immature precursors, astrocytes, and ependymal cells), migrating neuroblasts and immature precursors are silenced with the anti- mitotic agent and astrocytes are infected with a retrovirus. In the result, neurons that have the retrovirus are found in the olfactory bulb. Factors affecting neurogenesis Neurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain is affected by various factors, including exercise, stroke, brain insult and pharmacological treatments. For example, kainic acid-induced seizures, antidepressant (fluoxetine), neurotransmitters such as GABA and growth factors (fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), epidermal growth factor (EGF), neuregulins (NRGs), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and pigment epithelium- derived factor (PEDF) induce formation of neuroblasts. The final destination of NSCs is determined by \\"niche\\" signals. Wnt signaling drives NSCs to the formation of new neurons in the SGZ, whereas bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) promote NSC differentiation into glia cells in the SVZ. However, in the case of brain injury, neurogenesis seems insufficient to repair damaged neurons. Thus, Cajal's theory was accepted for a long time. In actuality, in the intercranial physiological condition, many neurogenesis inhibitors are present (for example, axon growth-inhibitory ligands expressed in oligodendrocytes, myelin, NG2-glia, and reactive astrocytes in the lesion and degenerating tracts, and fibroblasts in scar tissue). The inhibitory ligands bind to growth cone receptors on a damaged neuron, which causes repulsion and collapse of the growth cone in the damaged regions. Among inhibitory factors, oligodendrocyte and myelin-derived inhibitory ligands are membrane-bound, meaning that, in the case of injury, those factors are not upregulated or overexpressed, rather it is from direct contact between intact or degraded myelin (or oligodendrocytes) and newly forming neurons. Nevertheless, with scar formation, many cell types in the brain release growth-inhibitory ligands such as basal lamina components, inhibitory axon guidance molecules and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. Inhibitory action of such factors may be a protection of the brain from inflammation. Okano and Sawamoto used an astrocyte-selective conditional Stat3-deficient mice model to examine the role of reactive astrocytes. The result was increased widespread CD11b-positive inflammatory cell invasion and demyelination. Application Brain damage itself can induce endogenous regeneration. Many studies have proven endogenous regeneration as a possible treatment of brain damage. However, the inhibitory reaction of the surrounding tissue of damaged region must be overcome before the treatment produces significant improvement. Traumatic brain injury In the study of the endogenous regeneration of the brain done by Scharff and co-researchers, damaged neurons in a songbird brain are regenerated with the same neuronal types where regeneration occurs (in the case of the study, the hippocampus). However, in places where normal regeneration of the neuron does not occur, there was no replacement of damaged neurons. Thus, recovering brain function after a brain injury was supposed to have limitations. However, a current study revealed that neurons are repaired to some degree after damage, from the SVZ. The migrating ability of progenitor cells in the SVZ form chain- like structures and laterally move progenitor cells towards the injured region. Along with progenitor cells, thin astrocytic processes and blood vessels also play an important role in the migration of neuroblasts, suggesting that the blood vessels may act as a scaffold. Other factors that contribute of the migration are slit proteins (produced at the choroid plexus) and their gradient (generated by the flow of cerebrospinal fluid). However, only 0.2% of new neurons survived and functioned in this study. Enhancing neurogenesis can be done by injecting growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and epidermal growth factor (EGF). However, enhanced neurogenesis also have the possibility of epilepsy resulting in prolonged seizures. Parkinson's Disease Although endogenous regeneration methods are showing some promising evidence in treating brain ischemia, the current body of knowledge regarding promoting and inhibiting endogenous regeneration is not sufficient to treat Parkinson's disease. Both extrinsic and intrinsic modulation of pathological and physiological stimulation prevent the progenitor cell from differentiating into dopamine cells. Further research must be done to understand factors that affect progenitor cell differentiation in order to treat Parkinson's disease. Despite the difficulties in replacing compromised dopamine neurons through endogenous sources, recent work suggests that pharmacological activation of endogenous neural stem cells or neural precursor cells results in powerful neuronal rescue and motor skill improvements through a signal transduction pathway that involves the phosphorylation of STAT3 on the serine residue and subsequent Hes3 expression increase (STAT3-Ser/Hes3 Signaling Axis).

It is characterized by an inability of the body to respond to luteinizing hormone (LH), a gonadotropin which is normally responsible for signaling Leydig cells of the testicles to produce testosterone and other androgen sex hormones. The condition manifests itself as pseudohermaphroditism (partially or fully underdeveloped genitalia), hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (decreased or lack of production of sex steroids by the gonads despite high circulating levels of gonadotropins), reduced or absent puberty (lack of development of secondary sexual characteristics, resulting in sexual infantilism if left untreated), and infertility. Leydig cell hypoplasia does not occur in biological females as they do not have either Leydig cells or testicles. However, the cause of the condition in males, luteinizing hormone insensitivity, does affect females, and because LH plays a role in the female reproductive system, it can result in primary amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea (absent or reduced menstruation), infertility due to anovulation, and ovarian cysts. A related condition is follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) insensitivity, which presents with similar symptoms to those of Leydig cell hypoplasia but with the symptoms in the respective sexes reversed (i.e., hypogonadism and sexual infantilism in females and merely problems with fertility in males). Despite their similar causes, FSH insensitivity is considerably less common in comparison to LH insensitivity. Symptoms and signs The symptoms of Leydig cell hypoplasia include pseudohermaphroditism, i.e., feminized, ambiguous, or relatively mildly underdeveloped (e.g., micropenis, severe hypospadias, and/or cryptorchidism [undescended testes]) external genitalia, a female gender identity or gender variance, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (hypogonadism despite high levels of gonadotropins), delayed, impaired, or fully absent puberty with an associated reduction in or complete lack of development of secondary sexual characteristics (sexual infantilism), impaired fertility or complete sterility, tall stature (due to delayed epiphyseal closure), eunuchoid skeletal proportions, delayed or absent bone maturation, and osteoporosis. Cause A 46,XY (genetically \\"male\\") woman with complete insensitivity to LH, resulting in fully feminized genitalia at birth. Puberty appears to have commenced, likely due to estrogen replacement therapy. Leydig cell hypoplasia is caused by genetic mutations in LHCGR, a gene which encodes the LH/hCG receptor. LH normally acts through the LH/hCG receptor to stimulate the growth of Leydig cells in the testicles and the production of androgens such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by these cells. In Leydig cell hypoplasia however, there is a reduced capacity for the LH/hCG receptor to respond to LH. This results in hypoplasia or absence of Leydig cells, testicular atrophy, and lower than normal androgen levels. In the most severe form of the condition in which there is a complete lack of response of the Leydig cells to LH, androgen production by the testicles is virtually negligible and secondary sexual characteristics entirely fail to develop at puberty. Diagnosis Since the Sertoli cells are not affected by Leydig cell hypoplasia, anti-Müllerian hormone is secreted normally and so there are no Müllerian structures. Wolffian structures, such as the prostate, vasa deferentia, and epidydimides are present. In type I, abdominal testes are revealed on ultrasound; in type II testes may be descended or undescended. People with Leydig cell hypoplasia type I display no response to the hCG stimulation test; there is no increase in serum levels of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. Leydig cell hypoplasia type II can display either a pronounced rise of testosterone levels or no rise. In any case, the diagnosis is confirmed on biopsy of the testes, revealing either absent or hypoplastic Leydig cells. The inside of the testis will be grayish and mucous, displaying arrested spermatogenesis and the presence of Sertoli cells. The diagnosis can also be confirmed by looking for mutations in the gene for the LH receptor. A diagnosis of Leydig cell hypoplasia is usually made in the neonatal period, following the discovery of ambiguous genitalia, or at puberty, when secondary sex characteristics fail to develop. Puberty is the most common time for Leydig cell hypoplasia to be diagnosed. Treatment Patients with Leydig cell hypoplasia may be treated with hormone replacement therapy (i.e., with androgens), which will result in normal sexual development and the resolution of most symptoms. In the case of 46,XY (genetically \\"male\\") individuals who are phenotypically female and/or identify as the female gender, estrogens should be given instead. Surgical correction of the genitals in 46,XY males may be required, and, if necessary, an orchidopexy (relocation of the undescended testes to the scrotum) may be performed as well.

Lachmund (27 March 185320 February 1928) was an American classical pianist, teacher, conductor, composer, and diarist. He was a student of Franz Liszt for three years, and his detailed diaries of his time with Liszt provide an invaluable insight into that composer’s teaching methods and some aspects of his character. He founded the Lachmund Conservatory in New York and ran it for 22 years, and he founded the Women's String Orchestra, conducting it for 12 seasons.  Biography  Carl Valentine Lachmund was born in Boonville, Missouri in 1853,Some sources give his year of birth as 1854 or 1857. One source gives his place of birth as St. Louis, Missouri. but spent most of his early life in Iowa. His parents Gustav Otto Lachmund and Sophia née Schmidt were immigrants from Germany. His musical talent was recognised early. He went to Europe at the age of 16 and studied for six years, graduating in 1875 from the Cologne Conservatory, where his teachers were Ferdinand Hiller, Adolf Jensen, Friedrich Gernsheim and Isidor Seiss. He continued his studies in Berlin with Moritz Moszkowski, Friedrich Kiel (Paderewski was a fellow student), and Xaver and Philipp Scharwenka. In 1877 he founded the German Conservatory of Music in Clinton, Iowa. He accompanied the violinist August Wilhelmj on his 1880 European tour. In 1882 Lachmund went to Weimar to study under Franz Liszt, with whom he remained until 1884. His wife Carrie studied the harp in Weimar during this time. Lachmund kept a diary that eventually ran to some 750 pages, and it gives one of the most exhaustive accounts of Liszt's keyboard instruction. It is the single most valuable English-language source of information on Liszt's pedagogical style. After World War I, Lachmund decided to turn his diary into a book. He approached more than 200 people who had been in contact with Liszt to share their memories, to obtain more background information. Many did so, but the book was not published in Lachmund's lifetime. On his death, all of these and other papers were deposited in the New York Public Library. The Liszt scholar Alan Walker has edited, annotated and drawn extensively on the Lachmund papers in his research for his 3-volume biography of Liszt. Carl Lachmund seems to have been held in special favour by Liszt. He was the only American student to ever have a testimonial letter from the composer. He was also given Liszt's diary for 1876, and the manuscript of the 2nd Mephisto Waltz. In addition, he retained various of Liszt's personal items, such as a box of strands of his shoulder-length hair, five of his cigar stubs, a cognac glass, two pencils Liszt used for correcting and annotating manuscripts, and a linen handkerchief embossed with his initials. Liszt had a habit of writing out two copies of his letters longhand, signing both copies, mailing one and keeping the other. Lachmund owned a number of these letters. There was also a sliver of wood from Schiller's deathbed and some leaves from Goethe's grave. Lachmund was present at the premiere of Parsifal by Liszt's son-in-law Richard Wagner in 1882, and was invited by Wagner's wife Cosima to attend a reception in her husband's honour. After leaving Liszt, Lachmund taught at the Klindworth-Scharwenka Conservatory, then toured in Germany and the United States on his return. He was based in Minneapolis between 1885 and 1891. He accompanied the contralto Marianne Brandt on her 1887 American tour. He then settled in New York City, where he set up the Lachmund Conservatory, of which he was the director for 22 years. By 1912 it had become largely devoted to the training of voices for opera. In 1896 he founded the Women's String Orchestra, and conducted it for twelve seasons. Their concerts included one at the request of President William McKinley for the survivors of the battleship USS Maine, whose sinking in Havana Harbour in 1898 was instrumental in the fomenting of the Spanish–American War. He was an Instructor of Piano and Theory and Acting Director at the University of Oregon in Eugene from 1912 to 1913. He had moved there because of bronchial problems. He set up his own private teaching practice in Portland in 1914 but continued teaching at the university for a further year. He returned to New York later in 1914 and had a studio in Steinway Hall. He died in 1928 in Yonkers, New York, aged 74.  Students  Carl Lachmund's students included: * Felix Arndt * J. Bodewalt Lampe * Charles Gilbert Spross (1874–1961), and * Homer Czar Nearing.  Compositions  * Italian Suite (orchestra) * Japanese Overture (conducted by Theodore Thomas in 1887, and by Anton Seidl in New York, and by the Boston Philharmonic Orchestra) * several other overtures * Trio for Harp, Violin and Cello (played in the Berlin Philharmonic Concert in 1884) * Valse Impromptu, Op. 12 * Woodland Lullaby * Concert Étude (ed.

Personal life  Carl Lachmund's first wife was Caroline (Carrie) Josephine Culbertson (23 April 1854 – 28 March 1889), a harpist. They married on 8 May 1877. Their children were Helen Reed (August 1878 – 2 February 1922), Franz Culbertson (26 July 1885 – ??), and Otto C. A year after Carrie's death, in 1890 Lachmund married Mathilde Filbert, with whom he had three more children: Arnaud Filbert, Marjorie (sometimes seen as Marjoire) Gleyre, and Thalia. Arnaud (later known as Arno) Lachmund was employed by the Duo-Art Piano Roll company and worked with Felix Arndt, a student of his father's. He later worked for Ampico, and may have changed his name again to Arnold Lackman. Despite Arno's involvement in the recording industry, Carl Lachmund did not make any discs or piano rolls.  Posthumous award  On 9 May 2012, Carl Lachmund was awarded a posthumous Liszt Medal, the highest award presented by the American Liszt Society. The award was presented at the 2012 Festival of the American Liszt Society on 19 May.

Some, like pottery and basketry, have existed relatively intact since the pre Hispanic period, while others have gone through significant changes in technique and design since the colonial period. Today, much of the production is for sale in the state's major tourism centers, Acapulco, Zihuatanejo and Taxco, which has influence the crafts’ modern evolution. The most important craft traditions include amate bark painting, the lacquerware of Olinalá and nearby communities and the silverwork of Taxdo. History Petates from the state for sale at a fair in Mexico City Evidence of art and handcraft production in the state dates back to about 300 BCE, with the earliest showing Olmec influence. In the 7th century, the Mezcala people established themselves in the region, introducing stone sculpture and ceramics, of Teotihuacan heritage. The Aztecs conquered much of the region, with some handcraft production becoming important tribute items, for example, gold worked into pieces for nobility and priests. After the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, European techniques, designs and materials were introduced, which drastically changed how a number of products were made, and some indigenous products disappeared completely.López, Rick Anthony. Crafting Mexico: Intellectuals, Artisans, and the State after the Revolution. Durham [NC: Duke UP, 2010. Print. Many of the colonial period handcrafts, such as palm frond, metal and basket making, continue to the present day, buoyed to a large extent by tourism. In 1988 the state established an agency to preserve and preserve Guerrero's culture, including its handcrafts. Overview The handcrafts of the state reflect its socio-economic situation. The handcraft tradition is important not only culturally, but also because it provides much of the state's income, especially in small, isolated indigenous communities, which rely on it for most or all of its income.Mastache, Flores Alba Guadalupe., and Sánchez Elia Nora. Morett. Entre Dos Mundos: Artesanos Y Artesanías En Guerrero. México, D.F.: Instituto Nacional De Antropología E Historia, 1997. Print. For this reason, Guerrero's handcrafts show a strong indigenous nature, although European and even Asian influence can be seen in its aesthetics and techniques. Modern handcraft production in the past decades has been strongly influence by sales in the state's three main tourist centers, Acapulco, Zihuatanejo and Taxco. The main handcraft market within the state is Acapulco, both for goods made in Guerrero and other parts of the country. While there are locations selling high-quality wares, most are of low quality, especially those made from seashells. Because of the mix of cultural influences, past and present, some crafts, such as pottery, show a wide range of styles and decorative motifs. Craft types=Paintings One of the state's better known crafts is the painting of images onto amate (bark) paper, done in Nahua communities such as Ameyaltepec, Maxela, Xalitla and San Agustin de las Flores. One reason for its prominence is that it is very popular with tourists. It is popular with artisans as well, as the paintings yield a higher income than pottery. Although more colorful, the paintings are based on the sepia designs of certain traditional pottery, which in turn have roots in pre Hispanic codices. However, since it is a new craft, it is still evolving Initially the motifs were of animals and plants but then human figures began to appear, placed in scenes and landscapes. The amate paper is not made in the state of Guerrero, but rather it is from the state of Puebla, in particular from San Pablito in the Sierra Norte region. The paintings have become a characteristic of the state's handcraft tradition. Painters have been commissioned to create murals both in Mexico and abroad. and a number have taken the work to canvas, but still mostly sold in tourist markets. Lacquerware Lacquered boxes from Olinalá Another important product is lacquerware, part of a larger Mesoamerican craft tradition. Most is produced in Olinalá, but there are also production in nearly Acapetlahuaya and Temalscacingo. Lacquer work dates back to the pre Hispanic period, when it was used to preserve and decorate wood objects, gourds and more. It survives mostly intact, with changes only in decorative motifs through the colonial period to modern times. Until recently, most wood items were made from a fragrant species called linaloe, but over exploitation has made it scarce and expensive. While historically both chia seed oil and a waxy substance from an insect larva were both used, today only chia seed oil is used, mixed with mineral or vegetable pigments. Most Guerrero lacquerware is distinguished by the use of a “scratch” (rayado) technique for decoration, although pieces with inlay or painted motifs are also made. The rayado technique has its origins from Asian pieces brought by the Manila Galleon, but the current incarnation became popular in the 20th century. The technique consists of two or more layers of lacquer of different colors. When the new layer is added on top of the old, it is scraped with a tool such as a quill before it is dried to expose the color underneath in areas. The designs appear to be in relief. The color is generally over a base of red, white or black. The items that are lacquered today include boxes, chests, gourds. Silver and other metals Silver set in Taxco The working of silver and gold date from the pre Hispanic period, when these metals, especially gold, was an important tribute item. The metals were worked into ceremonial and decorative objects reserved for the nobility and priests. Today, the best known work of this type is the silver objects, especially jewelry, produced in the mountain town of Taxco, about three hours from Mexico City. During the colonial period, the area was rich in silver, making one man, Jose de la Borda, particularly wealthy. However, the mines eventually dried up and the working of this metal was down to one old silversmith by 1931, when American William Spratling arrived. Believing that the handcrafting of silver should be done where the metal has a history, Spratling convinced two young gold smiths in Iguala to move to Taxco to help him open a shop. He also believed that the role of designers, was to “utilize and dignify” the material, which was a new ideal for craftsmen at the time. Spratling's shop was not only a success, he attracted apprentices who then went on to open their own shops, including noted artisans Antonio Castillo and Antonio Pineda. These new generations of silversmits have also rescued a forgotten technique of combining different metals, which has a pre Hispanic origin, called “wedded metals.” The craft remains important in Taxco, buoyed by the town's status as a tourist attraction, as well as the National Silver Fair (Feria Nacional de la Plata) and competition in the last week of November. Most of the town's production is sold to tourists, and is taken out of Mexico. One challenge to the silver industry has been the price of silver, which can be prohibitive to its working in small, family shops. Gold is worked in several locations such as Iguala, Ciudad Altamirano, Cocuya de Catalan and Arcelia Ometepec, generally shaped into traditional colonial period designs. The most common type of gold used is “Huetamo”, which comes in several shades. Iron and steel working takes place in locations such as Ayutla, Tixtla, Chilapa, Cualac, which are particularly noted for their machetes. Tin objects are made in Tlacotepec, Tlalchipa and Cuetzala del Progreso. Palm frond weaving/basketry The working of palm fronds was promoted in the state by friar Juan Bautista de Moya in the early colonial period. Today, it is one of the more ubiquitous and varied crafts of the state, in part because the raw material is abundant. The fronds are worked into items traditionally used by rural farm people, such as bags of various types, fans, petates and especially sombreros. The best known of these is the Tlapehuala style, named after one of the towns that make them, in both a “regular” and fine variety. However, some of these products are also sold to tourists, especially carrying bags, sombreros and small animal or human figures. Much of the raw material comes from mountain regions in communities such as Atlixtac, Zapotitlan Tablas, Ahuacoutzingo and Copanatoyac. However, not all palm weaving centers are where the palms grow. Chilapa and Zitlala also are noted for their wares. Tlapehuala is known for the sombrero named after it, which is also produced in Chilapa, Zitlala, Zapotitlán Tablas, Tlapa and Copanatoyac. In addition to palm fronds, reeds are worked in several parts of the state to make baskets, toys, roofing for homes, bird cages and more. Corn husks are used to make decorative items, such as artificial flowers, along with toys. Pottery Pottery pieces for sale at a roadside stand on the highway between Mexico City and Acapulco The creation of pottery is one of the oldest crafts of the state and is one of the most widely practiced. Many are utilitarian items such as water coolers, utensils, plates, bowls, candle holders but decorative pieces such as animal and human figures. Religious items such as nativity scenes are also made. Pottery techniques are still mostly indigenous, including the continued practice of mixing cotton fiber into the clay to make it stronger. The best work comes from the central region, especially the towns of Zacoalpan, Nuitzalpa, Atzacualoya, Tixtla, Zumpando de Neri and Hitzuco. Often the pieces are colorfully painted. Pottery communities tend to specialize. For example, the San Juan neighborhood in Chilapa specializes in geographic motifs over glazed ceramics, and the town of Acatlan specializes in toys and figurines. The potters of Ometepec are noted for the creation of unglazed cantaro storage containers decorated in white lines and floral patterns. Most pottery is low- fire ware, which is traditional, but catering to the tourist and international markets has put pressure on artisans to incorporate more modern techniques. One of these is the increasing use of glaze. Wood working Wood parquet chairs for sale in Ixcateopan Wood is used to make furniture, toys, houses, ships and paper. Furniture for everyday use is commonly made throughout the state. In some areas, reproductions of rustic colonial furniture is made, such as in Taxco and Ixcateopan. Thiese pieces can include leather or palm frond components, and can include pieces made in finer woods such as cedar. In Venta Vieja, on the highway between Iguala and Chilpancingo, they make and sell living room and dining room sets, along with animal figures. Areas that made better-quality furniture in general include Chilpancingo, Iguala, Teloloapan and Ciudad Altamirano. In Teloloapan, Chilapa and Ayahualulco wooden masks and figures are also made, with lyres and various toy instruments made in Paraíso and Tetipac. In the lacquerware producing communities such as Olinalá, local carpenters make the boxes, chests, bowls and other items to be lacquered. Textiles Woman from Chilapa de Alvarez embroidering a blouse Textiles in the state are distinguished by the weaving and embroidery traditions of its indigenous peoples. The most distinctive of these is clothing items, but tablecloths, napkins and other wares are also made. Many Mixtec, Amuzgo and Nahua women still wear traditional dress, often made with hand woven cloth, with the finished product hand-embroidered. The main communities for this activity include Tlacoachistlahuaca, Xochistlahuaca, Yoloxochily, Huahuetónoc and Acatlán (Chilapa municipality). Both weaving patterns and embroidery designs can be intricate and adorn items such as blouses, shirts, pants and robes. The most distinctive indigenous clothing garment is the huipil (a kind of loose blouse or dress), which is produced by several cultures, such as the Mixtec, Tlapanec and Amuzgo. Backstrap looms are used in Mixtec and Tlapaneca communities to make sarapes and gabanes (a kind of overcoat) which are somewhat crude, dyed with natural or commercial dyes in contrasting patterns. The best sarapes are made in Amoltepec and the best gabanes are the try with red stripe variety made in Malinaltepec. Another distinctive garment is the enredo nahuatl (a kind of wrap belt), made of cotton dyed blue with three white stripes, over which there is embroidery with floral, religious, patriotic human and animal motifs. The community best known for this work is Acatlán. In Zitlala and Acatlán, women sew traditional dresses, blouses and skirts, all embroidered. In Ometepec they create white blouses embroidered with sequins, with designs depicting fantastic animals, vegetation, geometric patterns and even people. Rebozos are still woven in the state but are disappearing. Chilapa still makes some. Another popular item made for tourists is clothing items, which while not authentic, do contain elements in cut or decoration from indigenous dress. Other crafts Precious and semi- precious stones are worked, often with pre Hispanic motifs in location such as Taxco, Chilpancingo, Ixcateopan and Buena Vista de Cuellar. Various kinds of jewelry are made in Acatlán and Chilapa in family workshops. One particular item is brooches in various colors and materials. Various types of jewelry is made with fine gold wire in Ciudad Altamirano. Leatherworking is found in San Jerónimo (Costa Grande); Chilpancingo, Tixtla and Quechultenango in the center of the state; Arcelia and Coyuca de Catalán in the Tierra Caliente; and Buena Vista de Cuellar, whose work has won national competitions. Leather working in the state includes cattle, pig and goat hides to make shoes, jackets, coats, bags, holsters, belts, wallets and more. Patricio Ocampo Giles of San Martin Pachivia uses animal skulls and some other bones to create a unique craft. Using those of farm animals such as cattle, sheep and goats as a base, he creates masks and other images of old men, witches, shamans and more by covering the base with clay. While there is influence from the pre Hispanic period, the works are purely decorative, not religious. The coastal areas make a number of crafts, mostly as souvenirs for tourists. Many of these are made of seashells but with very limited artistry or quality. It is similar with items made with coconut shells, especially in Costa Grande region. However, there is one artisan, Gilberto Abarca Galeana, who has taken this work to a higher level, noted for creativity and craftsmanship, making masks, jewelry, tortilla holders, picture frames, key chains and more. Hammocks are made mostly in coastal communities such as Pénjamo, between Acapulco and Zihuatanejo, for both local and tourist sales.

The names of the states and ocean areas are stencilled. The painting measures by . Johns was inspired by a gift from Robert Rauschenberg of some mimeographed outline maps of US states, of the sort that can be colored in by schoolchildren. Johns was attracted to an image that is ubiquitous but \\"seen and not looked at, not examined\\", effectively a found object. He copied the outlines to a large canvas, to which he added bright splashes of red, yellow, and blue, sometimes mixed, with accents of black and white. His rough brushwork resembles an Abstract Expressionist style or the late works of Cézanne. Although the outlines of the states are recognisable, the colors do not always respect state borders, perhaps suggesting the blurring of boundaries and homogenisation of post-war American society, reinforced by the mass-produced effect of the stencilled names. It has been suggested that the painting may be a visual pun, as Johns \\"deliberately put American painting on the map\\" in the 1950s.Lanchner, p.20 Johns considered that he was painting a map, not making a painting of a map. The painting was donated by Mr. and Mrs. Robert C. Scull to the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.

India  In India the graduation ceremony is commonly known as convocation. At the universities and institutes, the graduation ceremonies are formal affairs, which include an academic procession by both the academic heads and the students. The students usually get dressed up in a formal attire, wear a form of academic dress - usually a gown that is worn open in the front, sometimes accompanied by a square hat. They will have a procession of the academic staff and graduands, a valediction and then they are handed the certificates by the chief guest.  Japan =Elementary and secondary schools Underclassmen, parents, and teachers are seated first. The vice principal leads in the local officials and special guests. The teachers all stand and bow to them as they enter. When the graduates enter, they are led by their homeroom teachers. Everyone walks very slow and deliberate. They walk in straight lines and make 90 degree turns if turning is necessary. The students line up next to their chairs and wait for the home room teacher to signal and they all sit at once. The homeroom teacher then joins the rest of the teachers. The head of ceremonies asks everyone to stand and bow towards the Japanese flag. This is coordinated by playing three chords on the piano. 1st-prepare, 2nd-bow, 3rd-return upright. Singing has a large part in the Japanese schools curriculum and is also a big part of graduation. The first song is Japan's national anthem, followed by the city song and the school song. The latter two are usually printed in the program. This is the last time the graduating class will sing the school song together with the rest of the school. At this point, or after diplomas, the lower class sings to the graduating class, and the graduating class to the lower class. Then everyone sings together. Some of the possible songs are: Tabidachi no Hi ni :ja:旅立ちの日に, Sayonara, Until the World is One by Ya-Ya-Yah, Sakura by Naotaro Moriyama :ja:さくら (森山直太朗の曲), Aogeba Tōtoshi and Hotaru no Hikari (sung to the tune of Auld Lang Syne). After singing has finished the principal, wearing a Japanese style tuxedo or black tie goes to the podium. Usually a female teacher wearing a hakama brings out diplomas on a large tray. The homeroom teacher for each class calls out the names of his or her students in gender- split alphabetical order. Recently some schools have discontinued splitting the class by gender. Students stand and say \\"はい\\" (hai), Japanese for \\"yes\\". Large classes may only have their names called. Smaller classes might have each student go to the stage and receive their diploma. They queue up, walking in straight lines, 90 degree turns, at a deliberately slow pace. At some elementary schools the students give a short speech about what they want to do at Junior High before receiving their diplomas. The principal reads the diploma out loud once to the first student in each class. The diploma is handed over full size in an open cover (not rolled-up). The principal rotates the diploma to face the student and hands it to them. The student receives the diploma by using their left hand first, and then their right hand before pulling it towards them. The student steps back and exchanges bows with the principal. The student then slowly closes the diploma and folds it under their left hand before turning and walking away. Returning to their seats, students stop and bow to the special guests. After all the students are seated again the principal makes a speech. The speeches are written vertically from top to bottom, right to left on a fan folded piece of paper. The principal's speech is followed by the head of the PTA. At junior high school an underclassmen may give a speech thanking the graduating students for things like being good senpai. And this is followed by a student speech from the student president. Students may give set group speeches, as if a dialogue between the lower class and upper class. Students take turns yelling out parts of the dialogue sometimes being accompanied by everyone or a few other students in unison. This might happen before, in-between and/or after the songs. After ceremony students may get a final address by their homeroom teacher. A few moments later, the graduates are free to roam around the school, in and out of the teachers’ office. At Junior High school, students take everything with them on the last day and may do school cheers with the underclassman in front of the school. The school calendar does not end with graduation. The next business day after the ceremony 1st and 2nd year students continue classes until spring break officially starts. Philippines Graduation is the award or acceptance of an academic degree or diploma. For Filipinos, the term “graduation” usually refers to the graduation ceremonies undergone by graduates who have finished a level of education. Some view a person as having truly graduated only if they have “marched” onstage to accept their diploma during the graduation ceremonies. Thus, graduation may be also considered a coming-of-age ritual for young Filipinos. Graduation ceremonies are held at the end of March or, in some cases, the beginning of April of every year. Filipinos take part in a graduation ceremony every time they complete an educational level. These ceremonies are usually held for graduation from kindergarten, elementary school, high school, vocational school or college, and graduate school. Attire In past decades, elementary school and high school graduates usually wore white: white dresses for girls and white polo shirts and black pants for boys. The same went for kindergarten “graduates” except that girls usually wore identical dresses in a style and color agreed upon by the parents. Recent trends call for togas and mortarboards as standard graduation attire. The Department of Education also recently called for austerity measures, prohibiting extravagant spending and requiring students to wear only their school uniforms under their togas. Graduates of vocational schools and colleges usually wear togas and mortarboards or caps. These are usually black, except for those colleges and universities who have togas made in the school colors. Underneath, the graduates wear formal clothes which may range from “Sunday best” to party attire. Those who finish post-graduate studies usually wear slightly different togas from those who finish undergraduate degrees. They also wear hoods banded with the color associated with their particular post-graduate course. All graduates usually wear corsages pinned on the left lapel or left breast of their clothing. Baccalaureate Mass High school graduation ceremonies usually have a baccalaureate mass before the actual graduation ceremonies begin. This is especially true if the school is Catholic. Elementary school and college/post-graduate school graduations may or may not have baccalaureate masses. Universities and colleges usually celebrate the baccalaureate mass and baccalaureate ceremonies on a separate day, usually the day before the graduation ceremonies. This is especially true if the school is Catholic. On this day, the awards for extra-curricular and co-curricular activities are given out, leaving only the major academic awards to be given on the graduation day itself. Awards The giving of awards for extra-curricular, co-curricular and academic activities are not the same throughout the country. Schools may give out all the awards on graduation day itself, or may do so on a separate day before the graduation ceremonies. Schools with a small student population usually opt to give out all awards on graduation day itself. However, bigger schools may give out lesser awards on the day before, which is called Recognition Day or Baccalaureate Day. These awards include those for extra-curricular and co-curricular activities like Athlete of the Year and Dancer of the Year, as well as “good conduct” awards such as \\"Most Behaved\\" and \\"Most Neat and Clean\\". The number and name of the awards may vary from school to school, depending on whom the teachers wish to honor. The major academic awards given out on graduation day for elementary and high school are the awards for valedictorian, salutatorian and honorable mention. Many schools give awards to their top five graduates as follows: valedictorian, salutatorian, and first, second and third honorable mentions. The other awards are usually the Leadership Award and the awards for those who topped the different subjects. The latter are usually referred to as the “Bests”, since they start with the words “Best in...” such as, for example, “Best in Math”. College and post-graduate schools usually award the following awards: summa cum laude (with highest honors), magna cum laude (with high honors), and cum laude (with honors). Unlike the awards given in elementary and high schools which depend on class ranking, undergraduate and post- graduate awards are given based on grade point averages, so that there may be more than one graduate with the same award, or in many cases, none at all. Awards are usually given in the form of ribbons on which are printed the name of the award, or medals with the name of the award engraved on the back, as well as certificates. Ceremony Although ceremonies vary from school to school, certain basic elements are usually the same. A typical graduation ceremony starts with the processional, which in some cases consists of the graduating class and their parents who formally walk side by side into the venue for the ceremony. Some schools have the students leave their parents at their designated seats. Boys then go up on the stage from the left and girls from the right. The two lines meet in center stage and go down the front steps, each pair bowing to the audience just before they reach the top step. After the processional comes the invocation, which may either be spoken or sung by a choir or by the graduates themselves. Then, the national anthem is sung and the salutatorian gives their salutatory address which serves as the welcome address or opening remarks. The keynote speaker is then introduced. This speaker may be a notable person, a person of some authority or influence, or even a former student who has made good in their chosen field and whom the school feels should be an inspiration to the graduates. After the keynote address, the school principal, or chancellor in the case of universities, presents the graduates to the representative of the appropriate government institution by having them stand up. The representative in turn declares the students graduates. After this declaration, the graduates are then awarded their diplomas. The actual diplomas usually are not awarded during the ceremonies; the graduates get their diplomas and other pertinent papers after they have complied with their clearance. In the past, schools usually handed out rolls of paper tied with a ribbon, symbolizing the diplomas. A graduate came on stage when their name was called, accepted the diploma with their right hand, then transferred it to their left hand and shook the hand of the person awarding the diploma. The graduate then went front and center, held the roll of paper at a slant between their hands, left hand at the bottom and right hand at the top, and bowed, then went down the steps and back to their seat. Present trends, however, are for schools to give out leatherette diploma holders during the ceremony, thus eliminating the need for the formal bow and expediting the ceremony. After the awarding of diplomas, the class valedictorian then gives their valedictory address and leads the school pledge of loyalty. The graduates then sing their graduation song and the awards for outstanding graduates are then given out. After the awards, the school principal then gives the closing remarks and the graduates may sing their closing song. The students and parents then exit the area with a formal recessional. However, they then usually return to have their souvenir pictures taken on the stage. Candlelight ceremonies are usually held during high school junior-senior (JS) proms. However, some elementary schools in the provinces made candlelight ceremonies part of the graduation rites. In the original candlelight ceremony for proms, the senior class president usually lit a large ceremonial candle on the stage, then lit their own candle from this flame and symbolically “passed the flame” to the junior class president. The member of the senior class nearest the stage then went up to light their candle and went down to pass the flame to the other seniors, who would then give their lit candles to the juniors. For elementary school graduation rites, the graduating class sings “One Little Candle” while the class valedictorian lights the ceremonial candle then passes the flame to the other graduates. The graduates blow out the flame together when they are declared graduates. The graduation song is a vital part of the ceremony. It is considered a symbol of the graduating class and is usually chosen by the graduates, although in some cases the class adviser or the teachers may choose the song themselves. The graduates usually try to choose a song that will express their feelings about graduation. Some songs have been chosen over and over as graduation songs and in many cases have defined a generation. The Diana Ross song “If We Hold On Together”, for example, became the graduation song in many Philippine schools in the early 1990s. Other songs that Filipino students have chosen to sing during their graduation rites are “Farewell” by Raymond Lauchengco, “The Journey” by Lea Salonga, and “High School Life” by Sharon Cuneta. “Garlands” are essential to graduations in the Philippines. These are usually made from ribbon, shaped into a lei and adorned with “flowers” made from the same material. Fresh flowers are never used for graduation garlands, except for everlasting flowers. Some people create special garlands by tying individually wrapped candies end to end; these are usually popular with kindergarten and elementary school graduates. Recently, garlands made of seashells have also been given at graduation rites. Many high schools now place stands beside the stage and hang garlands on them. When the graduates exit the stage after getting their diplomas, lowerclassmen usually put garlands on each of them. After the recessional, family and friends also place garlands around the necks of the graduates. Some people also give graduation gifts during this time; however, garlands are de rigueur. South Africa At the University of the Witwatersrand (WITS), the graduation ceremonies are formal affairs, which include an academic procession by the faculty staff. The WITS choir is always present, and as a fun twist once the academic procession has left the hall, the song \\"I Got You (I Feel Good)\\" by James Brown is played over the loudspeakers. Sweden In Sweden a high school graduation ceremony is celebrated as a tradition. The graduating students wear a student cap and celebrate the graduation ceremony. The students gather with their parents and well wishers, and rally on roads celebrating the high school graduation ceremony. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, unlike the United States, students do not usually 'graduate' from school below university level. They will normally leave secondary school or a sixth form college (if applicable) with specific qualifications, such as General Certificate of Education GCSEs and A-levels, Scottish Qualification Authority Standard Grades and Higher national courses or, less frequently, other certificates such as the International Baccalaureate. However, these are not usually presented in a formal ceremony. Many university graduation ceremonies in the United Kingdom begin with a procession of academics, wearing academic dress. This procession is accompanied by music, and a ceremonial mace is often carried. After this, an official reads out the names of the graduates one by one, organized by class of degree and/or by subject. When their names are called, the graduates walk across the stage to shake hands with a senior official, often the university's Chancellor or the vice-chancellor. This may be followed by the conferring of an honorary doctorate to a highly accomplished guest where a citation is usually read by a member of staff of the relevant faculty/school/department. Graduands wear the academic dress of the degree they are receiving. A speech by the chancellor/vice-chancellor towards the graduates is delivered at the start or towards the end of the ceremony. The actual degree certificate is typically not given to the graduand during the ceremony itself and is instead sent by post to the graduand's home address. Some of the older universities may hold their graduation ceremonies in Latin, even though few students understand this language. The Latin section of the ceremony may include a rendition of an anthem, sometimes called the unofficial anthem of all universities, the De Brevitate Vitae, also known as The Gaudeamus. Member institutions of the University of Wales hold their graduation ceremonies almost entirely in the Welsh language.  King's College London  King's College London graduands wearing academic dresses without caps At King's College London, the graduands shake the hand of the university's President & Principal (normally equivalent to a UK university's vice-chancellor). In addition, the hand of the Chairman of the King's College London Council, instead of its Chancellor (the senior official of University of London) is shaken. After being vested the power to award its own degrees from the University of London in 2006,http://www.kcl.ac.uk/aboutkings/governance/about/index.aspx graduates since 2008 wear an academic dress that does not feature a hat, designed by Dame Vivienne Westwood. With the influence of the University of London's tradition, being the first university in the world to devise a system of academic dress based on faculty colours,Groves, N. et al. (2011). \\"Shaw's Academical Dress of Great Britain and Ireland\\". Burgon Society. the gowns and hoods have been designed with colours that reflect the university's faculties/schools/institutes of study and the level of the degree.http://alumni.kcl.ac.uk/page.aspx?pid=792 Owing to its unique shape, the hood cannot be folded flat.Groves classification system  University of Oxford  At the University of Oxford graduands wear the dress of their status before graduating (their previous degree, or undergraduate academic dress), afterwards changing into the dress of the degree they have just received. Serving members of the armed forces may wear their military uniform underneath.  University of Cambridge  At the University of Cambridge, graduands are presented in the Senate House college by college. During the graduation ceremony, officially called a Congregation, graduands are brought forth by the Praelector of their college, who takes them by the right hand, and presents them to the vice-chancellor for the degree they are about to take. After presentation, the graduand is called by name and kneels before the vice-chancellor and proffers their hands to the vice-chancellor, who clasps them and then confers the degree. The graduate then rises, bows, and leaves the Senate House through the Doctor's door into Senate House passage, where they receive their diploma. Graduands wear the academical dress to which they were entitled immediately before graduating, including the hood. If this dress does not itself include a hood (e.g. they are undergraduates becoming Bachelors of Arts), they wear the hood of the degree to which they are about to be admitted. Thus a Master of Arts (M.A.) about to become a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) wears the dress of an M.A. A graduate of another university who is not yet a Cambridge graduate wears a B.A. status (for those aged under 24) or M.A. status (24 or over) gown i.e. their previous academical dress, plus the hood of a Ph.D.  University of St Andrews  The degree ceremony at the University of St Andrews is conducted through a meeting of the Senatus Academicus in the Younger Hall, and dates back to the early antecedents of the University. The graduation is similar to many others, commencing with an academic procession (juniores priores/in reverse order of seniority) of the masters, Principal, the maces, and Chancellor, during which the graduands and their guests sing The Gaudeamus. Much of the ceremony is conducted in Latin. Once seated, the Prayer is read by the Dean of Divinity/Principal of St Mary's College. After this graduands are called forward individually by the Dean of the Faculty within which they are a member (Arts, Divinity, Medicine, and Science). The graduand comes to the graduation desk before the Chancellor (or in his absence, the Principal, acting in the capacity of Vice-Chancellor), proffering the hood of the degree that they are about to receive to the Bedellus, and kneels. The Chancellor then says: :\\"Te ad gradum Magistri Artium/Baccalaurei Scientiae/Baccalaurei Sacrosanctae Theologiae/Baccalaurei Scientiae Medicinae promoveo, cuius rei in symbolum super te hoc birretum impono.\\" (\\"I promote you to the Degree of Master of Arts/Bachelor of Science/Bachelor of Divinity/ Bachelor of Medical Science, as a symbol of which I place this cap upon you.\\") Succeeding graduates to the same degree receive the formula \\"Et super te\\" (and upon you also). The Chancellor then touches the graduand's head with the graduation cap, and the Bedellus steps forth and places the hood of the degree to be conferred over the newly promoted graduate. The graduate then rises and bows to the Chancellor, and exits the stage to collect their diploma, before joining their fellow graduates in the main hall. Once the ceremony is complete the Benediction is read, again by the Dean of Divinity, and the academic procession leaves the hall seniores priores/in order of seniority, with the new graduates joining the end as a sign of the accession to the academic community. The procession continues down North Street to the quadrangle of the United College of St Salvator and St Leonard, where it dissolves. After each afternoon graduation, the General Council hosts a garden party for the new graduates and their guests, usually on the Lower College Lawn.  The Open University  Due to the large number and geographical dispersion of students, unlike most UK universities, degree ceremonies at the Open University are not the occasion on which degrees are formally conferred. This happens in absentia at a joint meeting of the University's Council and Senate (\\"congregation\\") on an occasion prior to and entirely separate from the ceremony - it is not unusual for Open University graduates to attend their degree ceremony some months (or even years) after they have formally graduated. The University's ceremonies – or \\"Presentations of Graduates\\" – occur Britain and Ireland throughout the year, usually in two batches; March to June, then September to November. United States The 2008 commencement ceremony for Cornell University In the United States, besides \\"commencement,\\" the term \\"graduation\\" is also used in schools below university level such as the high school, middle school, and even kindergarten and preschool ceremonies. The American Council on Education (ACE) is the authority on academic regalia in the US, and has developed an Academic Ceremony Guide that is generally followed by most institutions of higher learning. The ceremony guide and the related Academic Costume Code provide the core of academic ceremony traditions in the US. The ACE code addresses college and university dress: high school and other lower school gown colors vary from institution to institution. At many large US institutions, where many hundreds of degrees are being granted at once, the main ceremony (commencement) involving all graduates in a sports stadium, amphitheater, parade ground or lawn, or other large – often outdoor – venue is usually followed, but sometimes preceded, by smaller ceremonies (diploma ceremony) at sites on or around campus where deans and faculty of each academic organization (college, academic department, program, etc.) distribute diplomas to their graduates. Another means of handling very large numbers of graduates is to have several ceremonies, divided by field of study, at a central site over the course of a weekend instead of one single ceremony. At large institutions the great number of family members and guests that each graduating student wishes to attend may exceed the capacity of organizers to accommodate. Universities try to manage this by allocating a specified number of graduation tickets to each student that will be graduating. Traditional hat toss celebration at a graduation ceremony at the United States Air Force Academy At most colleges and universities in the US, a faculty member or dean will ceremoniously recommend that each class of candidates (often by college but sometimes by program/major) be awarded the proper degree, which is then formally and officially conferred by the president or other institutional official. Typically, this is accomplished by a pair of short set speeches by a senior academic official and a senior institutional official: :\\"Mr. President, on behalf of the faculty of Letters and Science, I hereby declare that these candidates have met all the requirements for the degree of ... and request that such degree be conferred upon them.\\" \\"Under the authority vested in me by the State of (?) and the Trustees of ? College, I hereby confer upon these candidates the degree of ...\\" Many colleges and universities include a Hooding Ceremony in their commencement program, in which the students wear a hood. Most American institutions reserve this to advanced degrees though technically all graduates are entitled to wear a hood of the appropriate scheme and size. Candidates traditionally have the hood placed upon them at the podium, while other schools allow graduates to put on the hood by themselves en masse after the head of the university confers the degree upon them from the podium. This is called 'to self-hood'. Doctoral graduates are nearly universally hooded at the podium. The hood is a part of traditional academic dress whose origins date back many centuries. Today, the hood is considered by some to be the most expressive component of the academic costume. Today’s hoods have evolved from a practical garment to a symbolic one. An academic hood is a symbolic garment, which is worn draped around the neck and over the shoulders, displayed down the back with the lining exposed. The hood’s length signifies the degree level; with the institution's colors in the lining and a velvet trim in a standardized color that signifies the scholar’s field. Graduation speech George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton at the University of New Hampshire's 2007 commencement A graduation or commencement speech, in the U.S., is a public speech given by a student or by alumnus of a university to a graduating class and their guests. Common themes of the graduation speech include wishing the graduates well in the \\"real world\\", cautioning that the world of academe is a special place where they were taught to think (a common variation contradicts this view). More recently, the trend has been to find a celebrity or a politician to deliver the speech. Notable exceptions are Columbia University, Davidson College, and Belmont University, where the tradition has been that only the current university president gives the commencement address. Though there is only one commencement, individual colleges and schools of Columbia often invite a speaker at separate graduation ceremonies held earlier or on another day, however. Special graduation ceremonies Many homeschooling groups hold their own graduation ceremonies, as it is uncommon (and often not permitted) for homeschool graduates to participate in their local school district's official graduation ceremony. Some GED testing centers hold graduation ceremonies for those who take the GED and pass. The parents and students of the class of 2009 in Centerburg, Ohio held their own unofficial graduation ceremony at the local park when the school board decided to cancel the official graduation ceremony, in response to a cheating scandal, even though only one person out of the entire 97-student graduating class was ever proven guilty of cheating. The school board's response was criticized by most media outlets in Ohio and even gained nationwide media coverage in the United States. The parents' and students' decision to hold their own graduation ceremony was cheered by many local businesses, and received mixed views, mostly through later letters to the editor of the Columbus Dispatch and other newspapers in the area.  Behaviour and decorum issues  It is common for graduates not to receive their actual diploma at the ceremony but instead a certificate indicating that they participated in the ceremony or a portfolio to hold the diploma in. At the high school level, this allows academic administrators to withhold diplomas from students who are unruly during the ceremony, or whose friends and family disrupt the proceedings. Some schools have banned the sounding of bull horns by the relatives of graduating students. High schools often inform guests at the start of a graduation ceremony that cheering for individual students should be reserved until all the student's names have been read, and their certificates collected. At the college level, this allows students who need an additional quarter or semester to satisfy their academic requirements to nevertheless participate in the official ceremony with their cohort before receiving their degree. In addition, with large numbers of students receiving diplomas and often no specific order they walk in, it is impossible for their actual diplomas to be given to them at the ceremony, thus them receiving simply a blank diploma to be filled later. Graduation parties People often throw graduation parties to celebrate the event. These parties can be more general ones, or they can also be themed. Games can be present, as well as music. Flower leis can also be incorporated into celebrations for graduating students, particularly in Hawaii. Parties can also have a food truck rented out for them.

It leaked from the oil refinery at Duque de Caxias (REDUC) operated by Petrobras. Petrobras estimated that a leaking pipeline released 600,000 liters (160,000 US gal) of oil into the bay, but according to Sindipetro - the petroleum industry's union - it was 2,000,000 liters (530,000 US gal) of oil that had been spilled.Taam, Mauricio (undated). \\"The Guanabara Bay Oil Spill Incident – “The Brazilian Exxon Valdez” An Institutional Perspective\\". United States Environmental Protection Agency. Retrieved 5 June 2012. The incident also had a large damaging effect on marine life in the ocean; as well as, other existing areas surrounding the bay area. Many fish suffered tragic deaths as they were washed up on the shore dead or covered in oil. In addition, the fishing industry suffered a great downfall and local fishermen were unable to work or fish in the bay.  Effects  Following the oil spill there were many negative after effects on the Brazilian fishermen, on the marine life and the environment. The fishing industry suffered tremendously as survival for the marine animals grew more difficult. Marine animals such as, the fish and crabs were unable to get oxygen and as a result were not able to survive.International Environment Reporter: Current Report. Washington: Bureau of National Affairs,1978. Print. Perry, Chris, and Kevin Taylor. Environmental Sedimentology. Malden, MA: Blackwell Pub,m 2007. Print. In addition, the aquatic plant life had also begun to die off and become non existent due to the oil resting on the surface of the water. This resulted in a loss of food for the marine animals as they had no aquatic plants to feed upon.[2] The fishermen - who relied heavily on fishing in the bay for their own survival - were faced with tragic times, as it became more difficult to catch fish. This resulted in a downfall in the demand for fishermen and lead to a loss of employment for such individuals.  Cleanup costs  The cost of the clean-up exceeded just monetary value as it also affected the individuals that relied on the welfare of the bay. The Petrobras refinery took all responsibility and vowed to execute a cleanup process. In addition to the Guanabara Bay, the contaminated areas included the beaches, and the surrounding areas leading to the beaches such as, the pathways and tunnels. The company experienced great losses in the cleaning up process as they had to compensate for damages and were fined heavily by the Brazilian government. [1]  Economic impact  The oil spill had a dangerous impact on the Brazilian society and the overall Brazilian economy. There was a drastic decrease in the number of fish species living in the bay after the spill, because the bay no longer remained a habitable environment. Almost 4000 fishermen - more than half - that had previously been employed to fish at the Guanabara Bay had to resort to alternative methods of income and working odd jobs to support their families.\\"Case study: An oil stained legacy - Greenpeace do Brasil versus Petrobras S.A.\\" in Tulder, Rob Van; Zwart, Alex Van Der (2006-01-20). International Business-Society Management: Linking Corporate Responsibility And Globalization. Routledge. . Retrieved 6 June 2012. It was unlikely that after the spill one would be able to catch more than 10 kilos of fish, where in comparison to before the spill, the average of catching fish was almost 100 kilos. [3] In addition, the quality of the fish from the bay area had also been an issue as many buyers claimed that the quality of the fish had decreased because it was now contaminated. As a result, the fish had been valued less and the prices had been reduced to about half.

Reed, who was the last surviving original member of the group, which he co-founded with four other musicians in 1953, is credited with creating The Platters' name. Reed thought of the group's name after noticing that DJs in the 1950s called their records, \\"platters\\". Reed was raised in poverty in Kansas City, Missouri, and moved to Los Angeles when he was fifteen years old. He moved to the Boston area during the 1970s, after the success of The Platters. He was the only member of The Platters who sang on all of the approximately 400 songs recorded by the group. His background vocals can be heard on The Platters' biggest hits, including Smoke Gets in Your Eyes, The Great Pretender, Twilight Time and My Prayer. He is lead vocalist on Sixteen Tons, Singin' in the Rain, In a Little Spanish Town, Sleepy Time Gal, Darktown Strutters' Ball, Blues in the Night and On the Top of My Mind. As the last surviving original member of The Platters, Reed waged a long, but successful, federal court battle over the rights to the name, The Platters. The courts ruled that Reed was the only heir to the group's name. In 2012, Reed said in an interview, \\"It's not right to have someone steal your name. It's just not right. We were cheated back then, but that's how things were done...It's theft, and I have to fight it so that no other artist faces this.\\" Reed toured throughout his career.

The French assault failed and the attackers withdrew. Girona (spelled \\"Gerona\\" in Castilian) is located about halfway between the Franco-Spanish border and Barcelona on the Autovía A-7. The action occurred during the Peninsular War, part of the Napoleonic Wars. As part of his plan to overthrow the Spanish ruling family, Emperor Napoleon ordered his soldiers to seize Barcelona in February 1808. The city's fortress was successfully occupied, but a few weeks later the Spanish people rebelled against Imperial French rule. Duhesme and his soldiers soon found themselves in difficulties. Hemmed in by Catalan militia and regular Spanish troops, the French general attempted to capture Girona in order to open up a secure supply line from France to Barcelona. The Franco-Italian force attempted to storm the city but they were repulsed by the city militia and two small battalions of Irish regular infantry in Spanish service. Duhesme fell back to Barcelona, but he returned to mount the Second Siege of Gerona five weeks later. Background As part of his plan to seize his ally the Kingdom of Spain in a military coup, Emperor Napoleon ordered several key points, including Barcelona, to be captured in February 1808.Gates (2002), 10–11 On 29 February, General of Division Giuseppe Lechi's troops were moving through Barcelona. Lechi ordered a military review, and, as his soldiers marched past the main gate of the citadel, they suddenly veered left and rushed into the fortress. Without bloodshed, the Imperial troops hustled the stunned Spanish garrison out of the fortifications and occupied the place. Among other strong places, the French also seized San Sebastian, Pamplona and Figueras.Rickard (2008), Barcelona On 2 May, the Spanish people rose in revolt against the French occupiers.Gates (2002), 12 By the summer of 1808, a 12,710-man French corps commanded by Guillaume Philibert Duhesme was based at Barcelona. General of Division Joseph Chabran led the 1st Division with 6,050 soldiers in eight battalions, while Lechi commanded the 2nd Division with 4,600 men in six battalions. The 1,700 cavalrymen in nine squadrons were under Generals of Brigade Bertrand Bessières and François Xavier de Schwarz. There were also 360 gunners.Gates (2002), 482 This modest-sized force was tasked with putting down the insurrection in Catalonia, sending help to Marshal Bon-Adrien Jeannot de Moncey in his bid to capture Valencia, and keeping control of Barcelona. In view of the seriousness of the revolt, these orders were completely unrealistic. Duhesme attempted to comply with his instructions by sending Chabran and 3,000 troops to join Moncey and directing Schwarz with another column to seize Lerida. Schwarz left Barcelona on 4 June and immediately ran into trouble. In the first of the Battles of the Bruch swarms of Catalan miquelets (militia) kept his soldiers from crossing the pass. He called for help and Duhesme diverted Chabran to assist him. But the two generals were unable to force their way through the pass on 15 June.Gates (2002), 59 After suffering 400 casualties in the second battle, the French, Italians, and Swiss retreated. The Catalan irregulars tried to oppose Chabran's withdrawing force in the plains but were easily driven off. The frustrated French and their allies then brutally plundered every village along their route back to Barcelona.Smith (1998), 260 Battle Alarmed at being isolated, Duhesme decided to clear his line of communications back to France. As he headed northeast toward Girona with a division-sized force, he encountered a large force of miquelets at Mataró. There were an estimated 10,000 Catalans with three or four cannons. On 17 June, the miquelets were easily defeated by the 5,963 Imperial soldiers and their eight artillery pieces. The Imperial troops celebrated their triumph by sacking Mataró for an entire day.Smith (1998), 260–261 As the Franco-Italian force continued on its way to Girona, the miquelets reoccupied the countryside and blocked all communication between Duhesme and Barcelona. Guillaume Duhesme In the expedition, Duhesme's force included General of Brigade Andrea Milossevich's 2,133-man brigade, Schwarz's 2,163-strong brigade, and 1,517 cavalry. Milossevich commanded the 2nd Battalions of the 2nd and 5th Italian Line Infantry Regiments and the 3rd Battalion of the 4th Italian Line Infantry. Schwarz directed the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 1st Neapolitan Line Infantry Regiment and the 1st Battalion of the Italian Velites. There were 409 troopers in the 3rd Provisional Cuirassier Regiment, 416 sabers in the 3rd Provisional Chasseurs à Cheval Regiment, 504 cavalrymen in the Italian Chasseurs à Cheval, and 388 men in the Neapolitan Chasseurs à Cheval. In 1808, the Onyar River divided Girona into eastern and western portions. The smaller part of the city, called the Mercadal, was then on the west bank. Since it was unprotected by any natural defenses, the military engineers had provided it with five Vauban-type bastions. The larger east side of the city was defended by a line of forts on a ridge, the most important of which was the Montjuich citadel. The city was ringed by a high wall dating to the Middle Ages.Rickard (2008), Gerona The Franco-Italians arrived in front of Girona on 20 June. After his demand for surrender was declined, Duhesme decided to attack the city's defenses.Gates (2002), 61 Girona was defended by 350 regular soldiers in two battalions of the Ultonia Infantry Regiment. The unit was recruited from Irishmen and led by Lieutenant Colonels O'Donovan and O'Daly. Girona was also defended by 1,600 city militiamen and a handful of gunners, for a total of 2,000 defenders. Another source states that the city militia may have numbered as many as 2,000. Duhesme directed his main attack at the Carmen gate on the east bank. The weakest part of the defenses, this gate was located on the south side. One battalion was sent against the Capuchins fort while other troops attacked two bastions on the west bank. The main attack started while Duhesme's aide-de- camp was still negotiating with the defenders. The French guns were quickly suppressed by Girona's artillery and the assault failed. The French commander tried again that night, ordering Schwarz's brigade against the Santa Clara bastion on the west bank. The attack was a surprise and the Italians gained a foothold atop the walls. In the darkness, some of the scaling ladders went astray, so the attackers were unable to reinforce the successful party quickly enough. A savage counterattack by the Ultonia Regiment erased the Italians' lodgement. In the morning, Duhesme directed his third assault against one of the bastions. But this charge melted away in the face of intense fire from the alert defenders. Altogether, the Franco-Italians suffered 700 killed, wounded, and missing. Spanish losses were described as light. Result Duhesme retreated to Barcelona, leaving Chabran and a brigade to hold Mataró. Soon after, Duhesme attacked a force of miquelets along the Llobregat River and drove them away. Chabran tried to entice the Catalan militia into battle but was unsuccessful. Finally becoming aware of Duhesme's troubles, Napoleon earmarked a newly formed division under General of Division Honoré Charles Reille to reinforce him. Reille moved out with an advanced guard and soon relieved the garrison of Sant Ferran Castle at Figueras. After assembling his whole division, Reille moved against the port of Roses, but was rebuffed by its defenders and the British battleship , which landed its marines to help.Smith (1998), 262 Hearing about the division of reinforcements, Duhesme prepared for a new attempt on Girona. The next action was the Second Siege of Gerona.

Such a reformulation is necessary since without it, as shown by Nakanishi, the Bethe–Salpeter equation possesses negative-norm solutions arising from the presence of an essentially relativistic degree of freedom, the relative time. These \\"ghost\\" states have spoiled the naive interpretation of the Bethe–Salpeter equation as a quantum mechanical wave equation. The two-body Dirac equations of constraint dynamics rectify this flaw. The forms of these equations can not only be derived from quantum field theory they can also be derived purely in the context of Dirac's constraint dynamics P.A.M. Dirac, Can. J. Math. 2, 129 (1950)P.A.M. Dirac, Lectures on Quantum Mechanics (Yeshiva University, New York, 1964) and relativistic mechanics and quantum mechanics.P. Van Alstine and H.W. Crater, Journal of Mathematical Physics 23, 1697 (1982). Their structures, unlike the more familiar two-body Dirac equation of Breit, which is a single equation, are that of two simultaneous quantum relativistic wave equations. A single two- body Dirac equation similar to the Breit equation can be derived from the TBDE. Unlike the Breit equation, it is manifestly covariant and free from the types of singularities that prevent a strictly nonperturbative treatment of the Breit equation. In applications of the TBDE to QED, the two particles interact by way of four-vector potentials derived from the field theoretic electromagnetic interactions between the two particles. In applications to QCD, the two particles interact by way of four-vector potentials and Lorentz invariant scalar interactions, derived in part from the field theoretic chromomagnetic interactions between the quarks and in part by phenomenological considerations. As with the Breit equation a sixteen-component spinor Ψ is used. Equations For QED, each equation has the same structure as the ordinary one-body Dirac equation in the presence of an external electromagnetic field, given by the 4-potential A_\\\\mu. For QCD, each equation has the same structure as the ordinary one-body Dirac equation in the presence of an external field similar to the electromagnetic field and an additional external field given by in terms of a Lorentz invariant scalar S. In natural units: those two-body equations have the form. :[(\\\\gamma_1)_\\\\mu (p_1-\\\\tilde{A}_1)^\\\\mu+m_1 + \\\\tilde{S}_1]\\\\Psi=0, :[(\\\\gamma_2)_\\\\mu (p_2-\\\\tilde{A}_2)^\\\\mu+m_2 + \\\\tilde{S}_2]\\\\Psi=0. where, in coordinate space, pμ is the 4-momentum, related to the 4-gradient by (the metric used here is \\\\eta_{\\\\mu u}=(-1,1,1,1)) :p^\\\\mu = -i{\\\\partial\\\\over\\\\partial x_\\\\mu} and γμ are the gamma matrices. The two-body Dirac equations (TBDE) have the property that if one of the masses becomes very large, say m_{2}\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty then the 16-component Dirac equation reduces to the 4-component one-body Dirac equation for particle one in an external potential. In SI units: :[(\\\\gamma_1)_\\\\mu (p_1-\\\\tilde{A}_1)^\\\\mu+m_1c + \\\\tilde{S}_1]\\\\Psi=0, :[(\\\\gamma_2)_\\\\mu (p_2-\\\\tilde{A}_2)^\\\\mu+m_2c + \\\\tilde{S}_2]\\\\Psi=0. where c is the speed of light and :p^\\\\mu = -i\\\\hbar{\\\\partial\\\\over\\\\partial x_\\\\mu} Natural units will be used below. A tilde symbol is used over the two sets of potentials to indicate that they may have additional gamma matrix dependencies not present in the one-body Dirac equation. Any coupling constants such as the electron charge are embodied in the vector potentials. Constraint dynamics and the TBDE Constraint dynamics applied to the TBDE requires a particular form of mathematical consistency: the two Dirac operators must commute with each other. This is plausible if one views the two equations as two compatible constraints on the wave function. (See the discussion below on constraint dynamics.) If the two operators did not commute, (as, e.g., with the coordinate and momentum operators x,p ) then the constraints would not be compatible (one could not e.g., have a wave function that satisfied both x\\\\Psi=0 and p\\\\Psi=0). This mathematical consistency or compatibility leads to three important properties of the TBDE. The first is a condition that eliminates the dependence on the relative time in the center of momentum (c.m.) frame defined by P=p_1+p_2=(w,\\\\vec 0). (The variable w is the total energy in the c.m. frame.) Stated another way, the relative time is eliminated in a covariant way. In particular, for the two operators to commute, the scalar and four-vector potentials can depend on the relative coordinate x=x_1 - x_2 only through its component x_{\\\\perp } orthogonal to P in which : x_\\\\perp^\\\\mu =(\\\\eta^{\\\\mu u }-P^\\\\mu P^ u /P^2)x_ u, \\\\, : P_\\\\mu x_\\\\perp^\\\\mu =0. \\\\, This implies that in the c.m. frame x_\\\\perp =(0,\\\\vec{x}=\\\\vec{x}_1 -\\\\vec{x}_2), which has zero time component. Secondly, the mathematical consistency condition also eliminates the relative energy in the c.m. frame. It does this by imposing on each Dirac operator a structure such that in a particular combination they lead to this interaction independent form, eliminating in a covariant way the relative energy. :P\\\\cdot p\\\\Psi =(-P^0p^0+\\\\vec P\\\\cdot p)\\\\Psi=0. \\\\, In this expression p is the relative momentum having the form (p_1 - p_2)/2 for equal masses. In the c.m. frame ( P^0=w,\\\\vec P=\\\\vec 0), the time component p^0 of the relative momentum, that is the relative energy, is thus eliminated. in the sense that p^0\\\\Psi=0. A third consequence of the mathematical consistency is that each of the world scalar \\\\tilde{S}_i and four vector \\\\tilde{A}_{i}^{\\\\mu } potentials has a term with a fixed dependence on \\\\gamma _{1} and \\\\gamma _{2} in addition to the gamma matrix independent forms of S_i and A_i^\\\\mu which appear in the ordinary one- body Dirac equation for scalar and vector potentials. These extra terms correspond to additional recoil spin-dependence not present in the one-body Dirac equation and vanish when one of the particles becomes very heavy (the so-called static limit).  More on constraint dynamics: generalized mass shell constraints  Constraint dynamics arose from the work of Dirac and Bergmann. This section shows how the elimination of relative time and energy takes place in the c.m. system for the simple system of two relativistic spinless particles. Constraint dynamics was first applied to the classical relativistic two particle system by Todorov,I. T. Todorov, \\" Dynamics of Relativistic Point Particles as a Problem with Constraints\\", Dubna Joint Institute for Nuclear Research No. E2-10175, 1976I. T. Todorov, Annals of the Institute of H. Poincaré' {A28},207 (1978) Kalb and Van Alstine,M. Kalb and P. Van Alstine, Yale Reports, C00-3075-146 (1976),C00-3075-156 (1976),P. Van Alstine, Ph.D. Dissertation Yale University, (1976) Komar, and Droz-Vincent. With constraint dynamics, these authors found a consistent and covariant approach to relativistic canonical Hamiltonian mechanics that also evades the Currie-Jordan-Sudarshan \\"No Interaction\\" theorem. That theorem states that without fields, one cannot have a relativistic Hamiltonian dynamics. Thus, the same covariant three-dimensional approach which allows the quantized version of constraint dynamics to remove quantum ghosts simultaneously circumvents at the classical level the C.J.S. theorem. Consider a constraint on the otherwise independent coordinate and momentum four vectors, written in the form \\\\phi _{i}(p,x)\\\\approx 0. The symbol\\\\approx 0 is called a weak equality and implies that the constraint is to be imposed only after any needed Poisson brackets are performed. In the presence of such constraints, the total Hamiltonian \\\\mathcal{H} is obtained from the Lagrangian \\\\mathcal{L} by adding to the Legendre Hamiltonian (p\\\\dot{x}-\\\\mathcal{L}) the sum of the constraints times an appropriate set of Lagrange multipliers (\\\\lambda _{i}). :\\\\mathcal{H}=p\\\\dot{x}-\\\\mathcal{L}+\\\\lambda _{i}\\\\phi _{i}, This total Hamiltonian is traditionally called the Dirac Hamiltonian. Constraints arise naturally from parameter invariant actions of the form :I=\\\\int d\\\\tau \\\\mathcal{L(\\\\tau )=}\\\\int d\\\\tau ^{\\\\prime }\\\\frac{d\\\\tau }{d\\\\tau ^{\\\\prime }}\\\\mathcal{L(\\\\tau )=}\\\\int d\\\\tau ^{\\\\prime }\\\\mathcal{L(\\\\tau }^{\\\\prime }\\\\mathcal{)}. In the case of four vector and Lorentz scalar interactions for a single particle the Lagrangian is :\\\\mathcal{L(\\\\tau)}=-(m+S(x))\\\\sqrt{-\\\\dot{x}^{2}}+\\\\dot{x}\\\\cdot A(x) \\\\, The canonical momentum is :p=\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{x}}=\\\\frac{\\\\mathcal{(}m+S(x))\\\\dot{x}}{\\\\sqrt{-\\\\dot{x}^{2}}}+A(x) and by squaring leads to the generalized mass shell condition or generalized mass shell constraint : ( p-A)^2 + (m+S)^2 =0. \\\\, Since, in this case, the Legendre Hamiltonian vanishes :p\\\\cdot \\\\dot{x}-\\\\mathcal{L}=0, \\\\, the Dirac Hamiltonian is simply the generalized mass constraint (with no interactions it would simply be the ordinary mass shell constraint) :\\\\mathcal{H=\\\\lambda }\\\\left[ \\\\left( p-A\\\\right)^2 + (m+S)^2 \\\\right] \\\\equiv \\\\lambda (p^{2}+m^{2}+\\\\Phi (x,p)). One then postulates that for two bodies the Dirac Hamiltonian is the sum of two such mass shell constraints, : \\\\mathcal{H}_i=p_i^2+m_i^2+\\\\Phi_i (x_1,x_2,p_1,p_2)\\\\approx 0, \\\\, that is :\\\\mathcal{H} =\\\\lambda_1[p_1^2+m_1^2+\\\\Phi_1(x_1,x_2,p_1,p_2)] + \\\\lambda_2[p_2^2 + m_2^2+\\\\Phi_2(x_1,x_2,p_1,p_2)] : =\\\\lambda_1 \\\\mathcal{H}_1 + \\\\lambda_2 \\\\mathcal{H}_2, \\\\, and that each constraint \\\\mathcal{H}_i be constant in the proper time associated with \\\\mathcal{H} :\\\\mathcal{\\\\dot{H}}_i=\\\\\\\\{\\\\mathcal{H}_i,\\\\mathcal{H\\\\\\\\}\\\\approx }0 \\\\, Here the weak equality means that the Poisson bracket could result in terms proportional one of the constraints, the classical Poisson brackets for the relativistic two-body system being defined by : \\\\\\\\{O_1,O_2\\\\\\\\}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial O_1}{\\\\partial x_1^\\\\mu} \\\\frac{\\\\partial O_2}{\\\\partial p_{1\\\\mu}} -\\\\frac{\\\\partial O_1}{\\\\partial p_1^\\\\mu} \\\\frac{\\\\partial O_2}{\\\\partial x_{1\\\\mu}} +\\\\frac{\\\\partial O_1}{\\\\partial x_2^\\\\mu} \\\\frac{\\\\partial O_2}{\\\\partial p_{2\\\\mu}} -\\\\frac{\\\\partial O_1}{\\\\partial p_2^\\\\mu} \\\\frac{\\\\partial O_2}{\\\\partial x_{2\\\\mu}}. To see the consequences of having each constraint be a constant of the motion, take, for example : \\\\mathcal{\\\\dot{H}}_1 = \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathcal{H}_1,\\\\mathcal{H\\\\\\\\}=}\\\\lambda _1 \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathcal{H}_1, \\\\mathcal{H}_1\\\\mathcal{\\\\\\\\}+}\\\\\\\\{\\\\mathcal{H}_1,\\\\lambda_1\\\\mathcal{\\\\\\\\} \\\\mathcal{H}}_2\\\\mathcal{+\\\\lambda}_2\\\\\\\\{\\\\mathcal{H}_2,\\\\mathcal{H}_1 \\\\mathcal{\\\\\\\\}+}\\\\\\\\{\\\\mathcal{\\\\lambda }_2,\\\\mathcal{H}_1\\\\mathcal{\\\\\\\\}H}_2. Since \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathcal{H}_1,\\\\mathcal{H}_1\\\\\\\\}=0 and \\\\mathcal{H}_{1}\\\\approx 0 and \\\\mathcal{H}_2 \\\\approx 0 one has :\\\\mathcal{\\\\dot{H}}_{1}\\\\approx \\\\mathcal{\\\\lambda }_{2}\\\\\\\\{\\\\mathcal{H}_{2}, \\\\mathcal{H}_{1}\\\\\\\\}\\\\approx 0. \\\\, The simplest solution to this is :\\\\Phi _1 =\\\\Phi _2 \\\\equiv \\\\Phi (x_\\\\perp ) which leads to (note the equality in this case is not a weak one in that no constraint need be imposed after the Poisson bracket is worked out) : \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathcal{H}_2,\\\\mathcal{H}_1\\\\\\\\}=0 \\\\, (see Todorov, and Wong and Crater ) with the same x_\\\\perp defined above.  Quantization  In addition to replacing classical dynamical variables by their quantum counterparts, quantization of the constraint mechanics takes place by replacing the constraint on the dynamical variables with a restriction on the wave function :\\\\mathcal{H}_{i}\\\\approx 0\\\\rightarrow \\\\mathcal{H}_{i}\\\\Psi =0, :\\\\mathcal{H} \\\\approx 0\\\\rightarrow \\\\mathcal{H}\\\\Psi =0. The first set of equations for i = 1, 2 play the role for spinless particles that the two Dirac equations play for spin-one-half particles. The classical Poisson brackets are replaced by commutators :\\\\\\\\{O_1,O_2\\\\\\\\}\\\\rightarrow \\\\frac{1}{i}[O_1,O_2]. \\\\, Thus : [\\\\mathcal{H}_2,\\\\mathcal{H}_{1}]=0, \\\\, and we see in this case that the constraint formalism leads to the vanishing commutator of the wave operators for the two particlein. This is the analogue of the claim stated earlier that the two Dirac operators commute with one another.  Covariant elimination of the relative energy  The vanishing of the above commutator ensures that the dynamics is independent of the relative time in the c.m. frame. In order to covariantly eliminate the relative energy, introduce the relative momentum p defined by P+p\\\\,,}} P-p\\\\,,}} The above definition of the relative momentum forces the orthogonality of the total momentum and the relative momentum, :P\\\\cdot p=0, which follows from taking the scalar product of either equation with P. From Eqs.() and (), this relative momentum can be written in terms of p_{1} and p_{2} as :p=\\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon _{2}}{\\\\sqrt{-P^{2}}}p_{1}-\\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon _{1}}{\\\\sqrt{ -P^{2}}}p_{2} where :\\\\varepsilon _{1} =-\\\\frac{p_{1}\\\\cdot P}{\\\\sqrt{-P^{2}}}=-\\\\frac{ P^{2}+p_{1}^{2}-p_{2}^{2}}{2\\\\sqrt{-P^{2}}} :\\\\varepsilon _{2} =-\\\\frac{p_{2}\\\\cdot P}{\\\\sqrt{-P^{2}}}=-\\\\frac{ P^{2}+p_{2}^{2}-p_{1}^{2}}{2\\\\sqrt{-P^{2}}} are the projections of the momenta p_{1} and p_{2} along the direction of the total momentum P. Subtracting the two constraints \\\\mathcal{H} _{1}\\\\Psi =0 and \\\\mathcal{H}_{2}\\\\Psi =0, gives Thus on these states \\\\Psi :\\\\varepsilon _{1}\\\\Psi =\\\\frac{-P^{2}+m_{1}^{2}-m_{2}^{2}}{2\\\\sqrt{-P^{2}}} \\\\Psi :\\\\varepsilon _{2}\\\\Psi =\\\\frac{-P^{2}+m_{2}^{2}-m_{1}^{2}}{2\\\\sqrt{-P^{2}}} \\\\Psi . The equation \\\\mathcal{H}\\\\Psi =0 describes both the c.m. motion and the internal relative motion. To characterize the former motion, observe that since the potential \\\\Phi depends only on the difference of the two coordinates :[P,\\\\mathcal{H}]\\\\Psi =0. (This does not require that [P,\\\\lambda _{i}]=0 since the \\\\mathcal{H} _{i}\\\\Psi =0.) Thus, the total momentum P is a constant of motion and \\\\Psi is an eigenstate state characterized by a total momentum P^{\\\\prime }. In the c.m. system P^{\\\\prime }=(w,\\\\vec{0}), with w the invariant center of momentum (c.m.) energy. Thus and so \\\\Psi is also an eigenstate of c.m. energy operators for each of the two particles, :\\\\varepsilon _{1}\\\\Psi =\\\\frac{w^{2}+m_{1}^{2}-m_{2}^{2}}{2w}\\\\Psi :\\\\varepsilon _{2}\\\\Psi =\\\\frac{w^{2}+m_{2}^{2}-m_{1}^{2}}{2w}\\\\Psi. The relative momentum then satisfies :p\\\\Psi =\\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon _{2}p_{1}-\\\\varepsilon _{1}p_{2}}{w}\\\\Psi, so that :p_{1}\\\\Psi =\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon _{1}}{w}P+p\\\\right) \\\\Psi , :p_{2}\\\\Psi =\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon _{2}}{w}P-p\\\\right) \\\\Psi , The above set of equations follow from the constraints \\\\mathcal{H}_{i}\\\\Psi =0 and the definition of the relative momenta given in Eqs.() and (). If instead one chooses to define (for a more general choice see Horwitz), :\\\\varepsilon _{1} =\\\\frac{w^{2}+m_{1}^{2}-m_{2}^{2}}{2w}, :\\\\varepsilon _{2} =\\\\frac{w^{2}+m_{2}^{2}-m_{1}^{2}}{2w}, :p =\\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon _{2}p_{1}-\\\\varepsilon _{1}p_{2}}{w}, independent of the wave function, then {w}P+p\\\\right), }} {w}P-p\\\\right), }} and it is straight forward to show that the constraint Eq.() leads directly to in place of P\\\\cdot p=0. This conforms with the earlier claim on the vanishing of the relative energy in the c.m. frame made in conjunction with the TBDE.\\\\ In the second choice the c.m. value of the relative energy is not defined as zero but comes from the original generalized mass shell constraints. The above equations for the relative and constituent four-momentum are the relativistic analogues of the nonrelativistic equations :\\\\vec{p} =\\\\frac{m_{2}\\\\vec{p}_{1}-m_{1}\\\\vec{p}_{2}}{M}, :\\\\vec{p}_{1} =\\\\frac{m_{1}}{M}\\\\vec{P}+\\\\vec{p}, :\\\\vec{p}_{2} =\\\\frac{m_{2}}{M}\\\\vec{P}+\\\\vec{p}.  Covariant eigenvalue equation for internal motion  Using Eqs.(),(),(), one can write \\\\mathcal{H} in terms of P and p :\\\\mathcal{H}\\\\Psi =\\\\\\\\{\\\\lambda _{1}[-\\\\varepsilon _{1}^{2}+m_{1}^{2}+p^{2}+\\\\Phi (x_{\\\\perp })]+\\\\lambda _{2}[-\\\\varepsilon _{2}^{2}+m_{2}^{2}+p^{2}+\\\\Phi (x_{\\\\perp })]\\\\\\\\}\\\\Psi where :b^{2}(-P^{2},m_{1}^{2},m_{2}^{2})=\\\\varepsilon _{1}^{2}-m_{1}^{2}=\\\\varepsilon _{2}^{2}-m_{2}^{2}\\\\ =-\\\\frac{1}{4P^{2}} (P^{4}+2P^{2}(m_{1}^{2}+m_{2}^{2})+(m_{1}^{2}-m_{2}^{2})^{2})\\\\,. Eq.() contains both the total momentum P [through the b^{2}(-P^{2},m_{1}^{2},m_{2}^{2})] and the relative momentum p. Using Eq. (), one obtains the eigenvalue equation so that b^{2}(w^{2},m_{1}^{2},m_{2}^{2}) becomes the standard triangle function displaying exact relativistic two-body kinematics: :b^{2}(w^{2},m_{1}^{2},m_{2}^{2})=\\\\frac{1}{4w^{2}}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ w^{4}-2w^{2}(m_{1}^{2}+m_{2}^{2})+(m_{1}^{2}-m_{2}^{2})^{2}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}\\\\,. With the above constraint Eqs.() on \\\\Psi then p^{2}\\\\Psi =p_{\\\\perp }^{2}\\\\Psi where p_{\\\\perp }=p-p\\\\cdot PP/P^{2}. This allows writing Eq. () in the form of an eigenvalue equation :\\\\\\\\{p_{\\\\perp }^{2}+\\\\Phi (x_{\\\\perp })\\\\\\\\}\\\\Psi =b^{2}(w^{2},m_{1}^{2},m_{2}^{2})\\\\Psi \\\\,, having a structure very similar to that of the ordinary three-dimensional nonrelativistic Schrödinger equation. It is a manifestly covariant equation, but at the same time its three- dimensional structure is evident. The four-vectors p_{\\\\perp }^{\\\\mu } and x_{\\\\perp }^{\\\\mu } have only three independent components since :P\\\\cdot p_{\\\\perp }=P\\\\cdot x_{\\\\perp }=0\\\\,. The similarity to the three-dimensional structure of the nonrelativistic Schrödinger equation can be made more explicit by writing the equation in the c.m. frame in which :P =(w,\\\\vec{0}), :p_{\\\\perp } =(0,\\\\vec{p}), :x_{\\\\perp } =(0,\\\\vec{x}). Comparison of the resultant form with the time independent Schrödinger equation makes this similarity explicit.  The two-body relativistic Klein–Gordon equations  A plausible structure for the quasipotential \\\\Phi can be found by observing that the one-body Klein-Gordon equation (p^{2}+m^{2})\\\\psi =(\\\\vec{p }^ {2}-\\\\varepsilon ^{2}+m^{2})\\\\psi =0 takes the form (\\\\vec{p} ^ {2}-\\\\varepsilon ^{2}+m^{2}+2mS+S^{2}+2\\\\varepsilon A-A^{2})\\\\psi =0~ when one introduces a scalar interaction and timelike vector interaction via m\\\\rightarrow m+S~and \\\\varepsilon \\\\rightarrow \\\\varepsilon -A. In the two-body case, separate classical and quantum field theory arguments show that when one includes world scalar and vector interactions then \\\\Phi depends on two underlying invariant functions S(r) and A(r) through the two-body Klein-Gordon-like potential form with the same general structure, that is : \\\\Phi =2m_{w}S+S^{2}+2\\\\varepsilon _{w}A-A^{2}. Those field theories further yield the c.m. energy dependent forms : m_{w}=m_{1}m_{2}/w, and : \\\\varepsilon _{w}=(w^{2}-m_{1}^{2}-m_{2}^{2})/2w, ones that Tododov introduced as the relativistic reduced mass and effective particle energy for a two-body system. Similar to what happens in the nonrelativistic two-body problem, in the relativistic case we have the motion of this effective particle taking place as if it were in an external field (here generated by S and A). The two kinematical variables m_{w} and \\\\varepsilon _{w} are related to one another by the Einstein condition : \\\\varepsilon _{w}^{2}-m_{w}^{2}=b^{2}(w), If one introduces the four-vectors, including a vector interaction A^{\\\\mu } :\\\\mathfrak{p} =\\\\varepsilon _{w}\\\\hat{P}+p, :A^{\\\\mu } =\\\\hat{P}^{\\\\mu }A(r) : r =\\\\sqrt{x_{\\\\perp }^{2}}\\\\,, and scalar interaction S(r), then the following classical minimal constraint form :\\\\mathcal{H=}\\\\left( \\\\mathfrak{p-}A\\\\right) ^{2}+(m_{w}+S)^{2}\\\\approx 0\\\\,, reproduces Notice, that the interaction in this \\"reduced particle\\" constraint depends on two invariant scalars, A(r) and S(r), one guiding the time-like vector interaction and one the scalar interaction. Is there a set of two-body Klein-Gordon equations analogous to the two-body Dirac equations? The classical relativistic constraints analogous to the quantum two-body Dirac equations (discussed in the introduction) and that have the same structure as the above Klein-Gordon one-body form are :\\\\mathcal{H}_{1}=(p_{1}-A_{1})^{2}+(m_{1}+S_{1})^{2}=p_{1}^{2}+m_{1}^{2}+\\\\Phi _{1}\\\\approx 0 :\\\\mathcal{H}_{2}=(p_{1}-A_{2})^{2}+(m_{2}+S_{2})^{2}=p_{2}^{2}+m_{2}^{2}+\\\\Phi _{2}\\\\approx 0, :p_{1} =\\\\varepsilon _{1}\\\\hat{P}+p;~~p_{2}=\\\\varepsilon _{2}\\\\hat{P}-p~. Defining structures that display time-like vector and scalar interactions :\\\\pi _{1} =p_{1}-A_{1}=[\\\\hat{P}(\\\\varepsilon _{1}-\\\\mathcal{A}_{1})+p], :\\\\pi _{2} =p_{2}-A_{2}=[\\\\hat{P}(\\\\varepsilon _{2}-\\\\mathcal{A}_{1})-p], :M_{1} =m_{1}+S_{1}, :M_{2} =m_{2}+S_{2}, gives :\\\\mathcal{H}_{1} =\\\\pi _{1}^{2}+M_{1}^{2}, :\\\\mathcal{H}_{2} =\\\\pi _{2}^{2}+M_{2}^{2}. Imposing :\\\\begin{align} \\\\Phi _{1} & =\\\\Phi _{2}\\\\equiv \\\\Phi (x_{\\\\perp }) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & =-2p_{1}\\\\cdot A_{1}+A_{1}^{2}+2m_{1}S_{1}+S_{1}^{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & =-2p_{2}\\\\cdot A_{2}+A_{2}^{2}+2m_{2}S_{2}+S_{2}^{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & =2\\\\varepsilon _{w}A-A^{2}+2m_{w}S+S^{2}, \\\\end{align} and using the constraint P\\\\cdot p\\\\approx 0, reproduces Eqs.() provided :\\\\pi _{1}^{2}-p^{2} =-\\\\left( \\\\varepsilon _{1}-\\\\mathcal{A}_{1}\\\\right)^{2}=-\\\\varepsilon _{1}^{2}+2\\\\varepsilon _{w}A-A^{2}, :\\\\pi _{2}^{2}-p^{2} =-\\\\left( \\\\varepsilon _{2}-\\\\mathcal{A}_{2}\\\\right)^{2}=-\\\\varepsilon _{2}^{2}+2\\\\varepsilon _{w}A-A^{2}, :M_{1}{}^{2} =m_{1}^{2}+2m_{w}S+S^{2}, :M_{2}^{2} =m_{2}^{2}+2m_{w}S+S^{2}. The corresponding Klein-Gordon equations are :\\\\left( \\\\pi _{1}^{2}+M_{1}^{2}\\\\right) \\\\psi =0, :\\\\left( \\\\pi _{2}^{2}+M_{2}^{2}\\\\right) \\\\psi =0, and each, due to the constraint P\\\\cdot p\\\\approx 0, is equivalent to :\\\\mathcal{H\\\\psi =}\\\\left( p_{\\\\perp }^{2}+\\\\Phi -b^{2}\\\\right) \\\\mathcal{\\\\psi }=0. Hyperbolic versus external field form of the two-body Dirac equations  For the two body system there are numerous covariant forms of interaction. The simplest way of looking at these is from the point of view of the gamma matrix structures of the corresponding interaction vertices of the single paraticle exchange diagrams. For scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, pseudovector, and tensor exchanges those matrix structures are respectively : 1_{1}1_{2}; \\\\gamma _{51}\\\\gamma _{52}; \\\\gamma _{1}^{\\\\mu }\\\\gamma _{2\\\\mu }; \\\\gamma _{51}\\\\gamma _{1}^{\\\\mu }\\\\gamma _{52}\\\\gamma _{2\\\\mu }; \\\\sigma _{1\\\\mu u }\\\\sigma _{2}^{\\\\mu u }, in which : \\\\sigma _{i\\\\mu u }=\\\\frac{1}{2i}[\\\\gamma _{i\\\\mu },\\\\gamma _{i u }]; i=1,2. The form of the Two-Body Dirac equations which most readily incorporates each or any number of these intereractions in concert is the so- called hyperbolic form of the TBDE . For combined scalar and vector interactions those forms ultimately reduce to the ones given in the first set of equations of this article. Those equations are called the external field- like forms because their appearances are individually the same as those for the usual one-body Dirac equation in the presence of external vector and scalar fields. The most general hyperbolic form for compatible TBDE is :\\\\mathcal{S}_{1}\\\\psi =(\\\\cosh (\\\\Delta )\\\\mathbf{S}_{1}+\\\\sinh (\\\\Delta ) \\\\mathbf{S}_{2})\\\\psi =0\\\\mathrm{,} where \\\\Delta represents any invariant interaction singly or in combination. It has a matrix structure in addition to coordinate dependence. Depending on what that matrix structure is one has either scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, pseudovector, or tensor interactions. The operators \\\\mathbf{S}_{1} and \\\\mathbf{S}_{2} are auxiliary constraints satisfying :\\\\mathbf{S}_{1}\\\\psi \\\\equiv (\\\\mathcal{S}_{10}\\\\cosh (\\\\Delta )+\\\\mathcal{S} _{20}\\\\sinh (\\\\Delta )~)\\\\psi =0, in which the \\\\mathcal{S}_{i0} are the free Dirac operators \\\\gamma _{5i}(\\\\gamma _{i}\\\\cdot p_{i}+m_{i})=0, }} This, in turn leads to the two compatibility conditions : \\\\lbrack \\\\mathcal{S}_{1},\\\\mathcal{S}_{2}]\\\\psi =0, and : \\\\lbrack \\\\mathbf{S}_{1},\\\\mathbf{S}_{2}]\\\\psi =0, provided that \\\\Delta =\\\\Delta (x_{\\\\perp }). These compatibility conditions do not restrict the gamma matrix structure of \\\\Delta . That matrix structure is determined by the type of vertex-vertex structure incorporated in the interaction. For the two types of invariant interactions \\\\Delta emphasized in this article they are :\\\\Delta _{\\\\mathcal{L}}(x_{\\\\perp }) =-1_{1}1_{2}\\\\frac{\\\\mathcal{L}(x_{\\\\perp }) }{2}\\\\mathcal{O}_{1},\\\\text{scalar}\\\\mathrm{,} :\\\\Delta _{\\\\mathcal{G}}(x_{\\\\perp }) =\\\\gamma_{1}\\\\cdot \\\\gamma_{2}\\\\frac{\\\\mathcal{G}(x_{\\\\perp }) }{2}\\\\mathcal{O}_{1},\\\\text{vector}\\\\mathrm{,} :\\\\mathcal{O}_{1}=-\\\\gamma _{51}\\\\gamma _{52}. For general independent scalar and vector interactions : \\\\Delta (x_{\\\\perp })=\\\\Delta _{\\\\mathcal{L}}+\\\\Delta _{\\\\mathcal{G}}. The vector interaction specified by the above matrix structure for an electromagnetic- like interaction would correspond to the Feynman gauge. If one inserts Eq.() into () and brings the free Dirac operator () to the right of the matrix hyperbolic functions and uses standard gamma matrix commutators and anticommutators and \\\\cosh ^{2}\\\\Delta -\\\\sinh ^{2}\\\\Delta =1 one arrives at \\\\left( \\\\partial _{\\\\mu }=\\\\partial /\\\\partial x^{\\\\mu }\\\\right) , : \\\\big(G\\\\gamma _{1}\\\\cdot \\\\mathcal{P}_{2}-E_{1}\\\\beta _{1}+M_{1}-G\\\\frac{i}{2} \\\\Sigma _{2}\\\\cdot \\\\partial (\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\beta _{2}\\\\mathcal{-G}\\\\beta _{1})\\\\gamma _{52}\\\\big)\\\\psi =0, in which : G =\\\\exp \\\\mathcal{G}, :\\\\beta _{i} =-\\\\gamma _{i}\\\\cdot \\\\hat{P}, :\\\\gamma _{i\\\\perp }^{\\\\mu } =(\\\\eta ^{\\\\mu u }+\\\\hat{P}^{\\\\mu }\\\\hat{P}^{ u })\\\\gamma _{ u i}, :\\\\Sigma _{i} =\\\\gamma _{5i}\\\\beta _{i}\\\\gamma _{\\\\perp i}, :\\\\mathcal{P}_{i} \\\\equiv p_{\\\\perp }-\\\\frac{i}{2}\\\\Sigma _{i}\\\\cdot \\\\partial \\\\mathcal{G}\\\\Sigma _{i}, i=1,2. The (covariant) structure of these equations are analogous to those of a Dirac equation for each of the two particles, with M_{i} and E_{i} playing the roles that m+S and \\\\varepsilon -A do in the single particle Dirac equation : (\\\\mathbf{\\\\gamma }\\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{p-}\\\\beta (\\\\varepsilon -A)+m+S)\\\\psi =0. Over and above the usual kinetic part \\\\gamma _{1}\\\\cdot p_{\\\\perp } and time-like vector and scalar potential portions, the spin- dependent modifications involving \\\\Sigma _{i}\\\\cdot \\\\partial \\\\mathcal{G}\\\\Sigma _{i} and the last set of derivative terms are two-body recoil effects absent for the one-body Dirac equation but essential for the compatibility (consistency) of the two-body equations. The connections between what are designated as the vertex invariants \\\\mathcal{L},\\\\mathcal{G} and the mass and energy potentials M_{i},E_{i} are : M_{1} =m_{1} \\\\cosh \\\\mathcal{L} +m_{2}\\\\sinh \\\\mathcal{L}, :M_{2} =m_{2} \\\\cosh \\\\mathcal{L} +m_{1} \\\\sinh \\\\mathcal{L}, :E_{1} =\\\\varepsilon _{1} \\\\cosh \\\\mathcal{G} -\\\\varepsilon _{2}\\\\sinh \\\\mathcal{G}, : E_{2} =\\\\varepsilon _{2} \\\\cosh \\\\mathcal{G}-\\\\varepsilon _{1}\\\\sinh \\\\mathcal{G }. Comparing Eq.() with the first equation of this article one finds that the spin-dependent vector interactions are : \\\\tilde{A}_{1}^{\\\\mu } =\\\\big((\\\\varepsilon _{1}-E_{1})\\\\big )\\\\hat{P}^{\\\\mu }+(1-G)p_{\\\\perp }^{\\\\mu }-\\\\frac{i}{2}\\\\partial G\\\\cdot \\\\gamma _{2}\\\\gamma _{2}^{\\\\mu }, :A_{2}^{\\\\mu } =\\\\big((\\\\varepsilon _{2}-E_{2})\\\\big )\\\\hat{P}^{\\\\mu }-(1-G)p_{\\\\perp }^{\\\\mu }+\\\\frac{i}{2}\\\\partial G\\\\cdot \\\\gamma _{1}\\\\gamma _{1}^{\\\\mu }, Note that the first portion of the vector potentials is timelike (parallel to \\\\hat{P}^{\\\\mu }) while the next portion is spacelike (perpendicular to \\\\hat{P}^{\\\\mu }). The spin-dependent scalar potentials \\\\tilde{S}_{i} are : \\\\tilde{S}_{1} =M_{1}-m_{1}-\\\\frac{i}{2}G\\\\gamma _{2}\\\\cdot \\\\partial \\\\mathcal{L} , :\\\\tilde{S}_{2} =M_{2}-m_{2}+\\\\frac{i}{2}G\\\\gamma _{1}\\\\cdot {\\\\partial }\\\\mathcal{ L}{.} The parametrization for \\\\mathcal{L} and \\\\mathcal{G} takes advantage of the Todorov effective external potential forms (as seen in the above section on the two-body Klein Gordon equations) and at the same time displays the correct static limit form for the Pauli reduction to Schrödinger-like form. The choice for these parameterizations (as with the two-body Klein Gordon equations) is closely tied to classical or quantum field theories for separate scalar and vector interactions. This amounts to working in the Feynman gauge with the simplest relation between space- and timelike parts of the vector interaction,. The mass and energy potentials are respectively : M_{i}^{2} =m_{i}^{2}+\\\\exp (2\\\\mathcal{G)(}2m_{w}S\\\\mathcal{+}S^{2}), :E_{i}^{2} =\\\\exp (2\\\\mathcal{G(A))(}\\\\varepsilon _{i}-A)^{2}, so that : \\\\exp (\\\\mathcal{L}) =\\\\exp (\\\\mathcal{L}(S,A))=\\\\frac{M_{1}+M_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} , :G =\\\\exp \\\\mathcal{G=}\\\\exp (\\\\mathcal{G(}A\\\\mathcal{))=}\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1}{(1-2A/w) }}. Applications and limitations  The TBDE can be readily applied to two body systems such as positronium, muonium, hydrogen-like atoms, quarkonium, and the two-nucleon system. These applications involve two particles only and do not involve creation or annihilation of particles beyond the two. They involve only elastic processes. Because of the connection between the potentials used in the TBDE and the corresponding quantum field theory, any radiative correction to the lowest order interaction can be incorporated into those potentials. To see how this comes about, consider by contrast how one computes scattering amplitudes without quantum field theory. With no quantum field theory one must come upon potentials by classical arguments or phenomenological considerations. Once one has the potential V between two particles, then one can compute the scattering amplitude T from the Lippmann- Schwinger equation J. J. Sakurai, Modern Quantum Mechanics, Addison Wesley (2010) :T+V+VGT=0, in which G is a Green function determined from the Schrödinger equation. Because of the similarity between the Schrödinger equation Eq. () and the relativistic constraint equation (),one can derive the same type of equation as the above :\\\\mathcal{T}+\\\\Phi +\\\\Phi \\\\mathcal{GT}=0, called the quasipotential equation with a \\\\mathcal{G} very similar to that given in the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. The difference is that with the quasipotential equation, one starts with the scattering amplitudes \\\\mathcal{T} of quantum field theory, as determined from Feynman diagrams and deduces the quasipotential Φ perturbatively. Then one can use that Φ in (), to compute energy levels of two particle systems that are implied by the field theory. Constraint dynamics provides one of many, in fact an infinite number of, different types of quasipotential equations (three-dimensional truncations of the Bethe-Salpeter equation) differing from one another by the choice of \\\\mathcal{G}. The relatively simple solution to the problem of relative time and energy from the generalized mass shell constraint for two particles, has no simple extension, such as presented here with the x_{\\\\perp} variable, to either two particles in an external field or to 3 or more particles. Sazdjian has presented a recipe for this extension when the particles are confined and cannot split into clusters of a smaller number of particles with no inter- cluster interactions Lusanna has developed an approach, one that does not involve generalized mass shell constraints with no such restrictions, which extends to N bodies with or without fields. It is formulated on spacelike hypersurfaces and when restricted to the family of hyperplanes orthogonal to the total timelike momentum gives rise to a covariant intrinsic 1-time formulation (with no relative time variables) called the \\"rest-frame instant form\\" of dynamics, See also * Breit equation * 4-vector * Dirac equation * Dirac equation in the algebra of physical space * Dirac operator * Electromagnetism * Kinetic momentum * Many body problem * Invariant mass * Particle physics *Positronium * Ricci calculus * Special relativity * Spin * Quantum entanglement * Relativistic quantum mechanics  References   Various forms of radial equations for the Dirac two-body problem W.

The general notion of coherence was developed by , as a generalization of the proof by Frobenius of the existence of a Frobenius kernel of a Frobenius group and of the work of Brauer and Suzuki on exceptional characters. developed coherence further in the proof of the Feit–Thompson theorem that all groups of odd order are solvable. Definition Suppose that H is a subgroup of a finite group G, and S a set of irreducible characters of H. Write I(S) for the set of integral linear combinations of S, and I0(S) for the subset of degree 0 elements of I(S). Suppose that τ is an isometry from I0(S) to the degree 0 virtual characters of G. Then τ is called coherent if it can be extended to an isometry from I(S) to characters of G and I0(S) is non-zero. Although strictly speaking coherence is really a property of the isometry τ, it is common to say that the set S is coherent instead of saying that τ is coherent. Feit's theorem Feit proved several theorems giving conditions under which a set of characters is coherent. A typical one is as follows. Suppose that H is a subgroup of a group G with normalizer N, such that N is a Frobenius group with kernel H, and let S be the irreducible characters of N that do not have H in their kernel. Suppose that τ is a linear isometry from I0(S) into the degree 0 characters of G. Then τ is coherent unless *either H is an elementary abelian group and N/H acts simply transitively on its non-identity elements (in which case I0(S) is zero) *or H is a non-abelian p-group for some prime p whose abelianization has order at most 4N/H2+1. Examples If G is the simple group SL2(F2n) for n>1 and H is a Sylow 2-subgroup, with τ induction, then coherence fails for the first reason: H is elementary abelian and N/H has order 2n–1 and acts simply transitively on it. If G is the simple Suzuki group of order (2n–1) 22n( 22n+1) with n odd and n>1 and H is the Sylow 2-subgroup and τ is induction, then coherence fails for the second reason. The abelianization of H has order 2n, while the group N/H has order 2n–1. Examples In the proof of the Frobenius theory about the existence of a kernel of a Frobenius group G where the subgroup H is the subgroup fixing a point and S is the set of all irreducible characters of H, the isometry τ on I0(S) is just induction, although its extension to I(S) is not induction. Similarly in the theory of exceptional characters the isometry τ is again induction. In more complicated cases the isometry τ is no longer induction. For example, in the Feit–Thompson theorem the isometry τ is the Dade isometry.

In Zambia, it separates the Lufilian Belt to the northwest from the Zambezi Belt to the southeast. It is associated with a sinistral strike slip movement. The Mwembeshi Shear Zone lies between the Congo craton to the NW and the Kalahari craton to the SE, to the west (in today's orientation) of the Mozambique Belt, which is on the north and east side of the Kalahari Craton. It was formed during the Pan-African orogeny when \\"North\\" and \\"South\\" Gondwana were amalgamated along the Kuunga orogeny zone between 580 Ma and 480 Ma. The date of around 550 Ma for the Mwembeshi shear zone is based on U-Pb zircon ages of syntectonic granites from the Hook massif and of associated hypabyssal rhyolite. During the amalgamation there was sinistral transpression along the boundary between the Kalahari craton and the Congo and Tanzanian cratons (which had already amalgamated), which is now expressed as the Mwembeshi Shear Zone. The sinistral sense shows that, in modern coordinates, the Congo-Sao Francisco Craton approached the remainder of southwestern Gondwana from the north, although at the time southwestern Gondwana was oriented about 90 degrees clockwise of today's orientation, and the Congo Craton approached from the east. There was little vertical displacement, but Mwembeshi is a major sinistral transcurrent shear zone. The shear zone accommodates a change in the structural vergence between the Zambezi Belt and the Lufilian Arc. Further to the southwest, the shear zone extends along part at least of the Damaran belt. There are known to be basic connections between geological terranes and mineralization models, so understanding the Mwembeshi Shear Zone is important to understanding where mineral resources may be found in the region. Despite this, as of 1990 there had been relatively little exploration.

He was one of the principal expert witnesses at two trials which examined the quality of the water supply in Jersey City, New Jersey, and which evaluated the safety and utility of chlorine for production of \\"pure and wholesome\\" drinking water. The second trial verdict approved the use of chlorine to disinfect drinking water which led to an explosion of its use in water supplies across the U.S. Early life and education John L.

Along with other physicians, he founded the outpatient clinic at Paterson General Hospital in 1887 and worked there until 1892. In 1888, he married Amy Arrowsmith and their only son, Graham, was born within the year. Leal's career in Paterson city government continued with his appointment as Health Inspector in 1891 and Health Officer in 1892. As Health Officer, Leal was responsible for the identification of epidemics of communicable diseases and for the disinfection of the homes of the afflicted. He also oversaw the public water supply and was responsible for constructing the growing network of sewers to remove domestic and industrial wastes from the City. To prevent the spread of contagious diseases, he was responsible for building an Isolation Hospital in Paterson in 1897, which, at the time, was considered a model facility.Leal, John L. (1897). “Isolation Hospitals.” Public Health Pap Rep. 1896'.' 22: 200–206. He published several papers during his tenure as Health Officer including one that described the cause of a waterborne typhoid fever outbreak in Paterson.Leal, John L. (1900). “An Epidemic of Typhoid Fever Due to an Infected Public Water Supply”, Public Health Pap Rep. 1899; 25: 166–171. In 1899, Leal left the city's service and became the sanitary adviser to the East Jersey Water Company. His decision to focus on matters of public health and the safety of drinking water was driven in part by his personal experiences and from the influence of Garret Hobart, who became the 24th Vice President of the United States in 1896. Toward the end of his life, Leal was President of the Board of Health for the City of Paterson. Professional associations Leal belonged to a large number of professional associations. In 1884, he was elected a member of the Medical Society of New Jersey, and he was an active member of the Passaic County Medical Society. In 1900, he was Vice President of that organization. Despite his concentration on water treatment affairs after 1899, he was still involved in the Passaic County Medical Society, serving on the Legislative Committee in 1900 and in 1901 he was President.Nelson, William, and Charles A. Shriner. (1920). History of Paterson and Its Environs Vol. 2, New York: Lewis Historical Publishing Company, 45, 432.

Jersey City water supply In 1899, Jersey City entered into a contract with Patrick H. Flynn to build a water supply to replace the one that was significantly contaminated by sewage. A large dam was built on the Rockaway River which resulted in the formation of Boonton Reservoir that had a capacity of over 7 billion gallons of water. During construction, the project was taken over by the Jersey City Water Supply Company (JCWSC), which was a private water company that employed John L. Leal as its sanitary adviser. Included in Leal's responsibilities was the removal of illegally constructed privies and other obvious sources of sewage contamination from the watershed above Boonton Reservoir. The dam, reservoir and 23-mile pipeline was completed and on May 4, 1904, water from the project was first delivered to Jersey City. As was common at this time, no treatment of any kind was provided to the water supply. City officials were not pleased with the project as delivered by the JCWSC and filed a lawsuit in the Chancery Court of New Jersey. Among the many complaints by Jersey City officials was the contention that the water served to the city was not \\"pure and wholesome\\" as required by the contract.McGuire, Michael J. (2013).

On May 1, 1908, Vice Chancellor Stevens issued a 100-page opinion that supported many of the contract claims made by the JCWSC but, most importantly, found (for the plaintiffs) that two to three times per year, water that could not be considered \\"pure and wholesome\\" was delivered to Jersey City from the Boonton Reservoir water supply. In his final decree dated June 4, 1908, Stevens ordered the JCWSC to pay for the construction of sewers to remove contaminants from the Rockaway River watershed or create \\"other plans or devices\\" which could be used instead to produce water of the required purity. The JCWSC was given three months to come up with \\"other plans or devices\\" and to present them to a special master, Justice William J. Magie. As a physician who was trained in bacteriology, Leal knew that chlorine killed bacteria. As Health Officer for Paterson, Leal used solutions of chloride of lime (calcium hypochlorite) to \\"disinfect\\" homes where scarlet fever, diphtheria and other communicable diseases were found. He was also aware of previous efforts to use chlorine in drinking water supplies. In 1897, high concentrations of chlorine derived from chloride of lime were used to disinfect the reservoir and pipelines of Maidstone, England, after an outbreak of typhoid fever. In 1905, Dr. Alexander Cruickshank Houston devised a crude sodium hypochlorite feed system to kill typhoid bacteria in the water supply of Lincoln, England, that was being treated with an inadequate filtration system. During Leal's testimony in the second trial, he made extensive references to the Lincoln example. He also stated in the trial that he had conducted laboratory disinfection experiments using chlorine as early as 1898. On June 19, 1908, Leal hired George W. Fuller to construct a chlorination plant at Boonton Reservoir to disinfect the water for Jersey City as a representation of \\"other plans or devices\\".Leal, John L. (1909). “The Sterilization Plant of the Jersey City Water Supply Company at Boonton, N.J.” Proceedings American Water Works Association, 100-9. At the time, Fuller was, perhaps, the most respected sanitary engineer in the U.S. In 99 days, Fuller designed the chlorination plant and supervised its construction. Dilute solutions of chloride of lime were accurately fed by gravity to the water being treated.Fuller, George W. (1909). “Description of the Process and Plant of the Jersey City Water Supply Company for the Sterilization of the Water of the Boonton Reservoir”, Proceedings American Water Works Association 110-34. Fuller based his design on the successful aluminum sulfate feed system that he had built at the Little Falls Water Treatment Plant in 1902. The chlorination plant at Boonton Reservoir treating an average of 40 million gallons per day went on-line on September 26, 1908. Since then, water from this source has been continuously chlorinated, making it the water supply with the longest history of disinfection. The second trial began on September 29, 1908, before Justice William J. Magie. The purpose of this trial was to determine if the chloride of lime system that had been installed by JCWSC was effective in controlling harmful bacterial levels and capable of providing water that was \\"pure and wholesome\\". Over 38 days, dozens of witnesses were heard and hundreds of exhibits were submitted. More than three thousand pages recorded the testimony of expert witnesses for both sides including William T. Sedgwick, George C. Whipple, Earle B. Phelps, Charles-Edward A. Winslow and a number of other experts for the plaintiffs and John L. Leal, George W. Fuller and Rudolph Hering (among others) for the defendants. Justice Magie issued his ruling on May 9, 1910, which was a victory for the defendants. Chlorine was an acceptable treatment for the removal of pathogens from drinking water and for making the water \\"pure and wholesome\\" for human consumption. “I do therefore find and report that this device is capable of rendering the water delivered to Jersey City, pure and wholesome, for the purposes for which it is intended, and is effective in removing from the water those dangerous germs which were deemed by the decree to possibly exist therein at certain times.”Magie, William J. (1910). In Chancery of New Jersey: Between the Mayor and Aldermen of Jersey City, Complainant, and the Jersey City Water Supply Co., Defendant. Report for Hon. W.J. Magie, special master on cost of sewers, etc., and on efficiency of sterilization plant at Boonton, Press Chronicle Co., Jersey City, New Jersey, (Case Number 27/475-Z-45-314), 1-15. The ruling by Justice Magie was supported on appeal by the New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals and the New Jersey Supreme Court. Legacy Death rates for typhoid fever in the U.S. 1906–1960 Leal's application of chlorine disinfection technology and his defense of the chemical's use, contributed significantly to the eradication of typhoid fever and other waterborne diseases in the U.S.. On September 26, 1908, only the Jersey City water supply was disinfected using chlorine. A survey of water utilities showed that by 1914, over 21 million people were being served chlorinated water in the U.S.Longley, Francis F. (1915). “Present Status of Disinfection of Water Supplies”, Journal American Water Works Association',' 2: 679-92. By 1918, more than 1,000 North American cities were using chlorine to disinfect their water supplies, which served approximately 33 million people.Race, Joseph. (1918). Chlorination of Water. New York: Wiley, 12. Statistics on the typhoid fever death rate in the U.S. showed a dramatic decrease in deaths due to this dreaded disease after the wide introduction of chlorine for disinfection. Filtration of water supplies contributed to the decrease in the typhoid fever death rate but chlorination is generally acknowledged as having a major impact on increased life expectancy in the U.S.Jedckie, Peter. (2007). Scientific American: Great Inventions of the 20th Century. New York: Infobase Publishing.“The 100 Events (That Changed the World)”, Life (Fall 1997), 14-134. Unfortunately, Leal is seldom given credit for his pioneering work in the disinfection of drinking water. George A. Johnson was a plant operator and laboratory technician who worked on the chlorination plant at Boonton Reservoir. His later writings gave no credit to Leal and, by inference, Johnson took the credit for the decision to use chlorine on the Jersey City water supply. The record shows that Leal came up with the idea to disinfect the water supply of Jersey City and he should be given the credit for this major advance in public health.Baker, Moses N. (1981).

Biography Fernshaw: A Bush Symphony, 1900, National Gallery of Victoria While still a teenager, he began his studies at the Royal Scottish Academy in Edinburgh and exhibited his first works shortly after turning twenty. In 1872, he followed his family to Melbourne, where he remained for three years, but returned to Scotland when he found that the local art instruction did not meet his needs for further development. Once back, he came under the influence of the Glasgow School and held numerous exhibitions, in Liverpool and Manchester as well as throughout Scotland. As his reputation grew, he was able to join the prestigious Savage Club in London. In 1884, he decided to return to Australia and, except for one short visit home, would remain there for the rest of his life. It was then that he became primarily known as a landscape painter. Paterson renewed his friendship with the Swiss-born landscape painter Louis Buvelot, one of the founders of the Heidelberg School (as in Heidelberg, Victoria), whose en plein air methods suited Paterson. Otherwise, his Romantic style was at odds with the more Impressionistic approach of the Heidelbergers and his exhibitions with the group were only moderately successful. Together with several other well-known artists, he broke away from the Victorian Academy of Art to help create the Australian Art Association, which eventually joined with other organizations to become the Victorian Artists Society. In 1902, Paterson became its President. In the same year he was appointed a trustee of the public library, museums and National Gallery of Victoria. During economic downturns, he would support himself by poultry farming. Although well-liked and outgoing, he never married and died, suddenly, at home. His niece, Esther Paterson, was an illustrator and cartoonist and his nephew, Louis Esson, was a poet and playwright.

They are used by public agencies in the United States in formulating guidelines in assessing toxicity hazards, in particular from trace metals or organic contaminants. The ERL and ERM measures are expressed as specific chemical concentrations of a toxic substance in sediment. The ERL indicates the concentration below which toxic effects are scarcely observed or predicted: the ERM indicates that above which effects are generally or always observed.Long, Edward R., Donald D.

Accessed: May 3, 2012. They are not regulatory criteria in any way and are not intended to be used as such. Derivation  NOAA originally calculated ERL/ERMs using existing toxicity data compiled from completed toxicity assays with varying endpoints, including effects on commonly tested organisms, particularly at sensitive life stages. The process is considered a \\"weight of evidence approach\\", in which results are based on a large database of previously conducted studies. The studies used included synoptically collected sediment chemical analyses and toxicity effects data. Using data already collected (\\"data mining\\") has the advantage of being able to quickly and inexpensively make an assessment with a large dataset that would otherwise require much more time-consuming and costly specific toxicity assays. Compiled data sets include a variety of endpoints including mortality, reproduction, growth rate, and juvenile survival in sediment toxicity data sets for all organisms for which tests have been conducted. Studies are screened, and only those assays using standardized methods and resulting in significant effects are used for the determination of ERL/ERM guidelines. In summary, the key links between the compiled studies are the testing of a specific analyte - toxicity assays used are for sediment, and a significant effect must be determined. The data is arranged by ordering the concentrations from lowest to highest. After ranking, both the 10th and 50th percentile concentrations are determined over the range of endpoint concentrations. The 10th percentile of the ranked data is identified as the ERL, and is considered indicative of concentrations below which adverse effects (relatively) rarely occur. The 50th percentile of the ranked data is identified as the ERM, and is indicative of concentrations above which adverse effects (relatively) frequently occur. Government agency use  Sediment Quality Guidelines (SQGs) are used by US federal agencies, state agencies, and environmental consulting firms to characterize toxic levels of chemicals in marine and freshwater sediment. Following here is a summary of how the ERL/ERM guidelines are used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, United States Geological Survey (USGS), and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). NOAA NOAA scientists use SQGs as a way to estimate if a concentration of contaminant in a sediment sample may have toxicological effects. The original intent of using SQGs was to rank order areas that may need further toxicological testing and potential chemicals of concern. Across the United States, NOAA has used these guidelines in regional surveys to determine the degree of contamination relative to other areas, and to identify if the concentration of a chemical exceeded guidelines, indicating a possible adverse effect. NOAA also reports ERLs and ERMs, along with other guidelines, on tables known as Screening Quick Reference Tables (SQuiRT) cards. These tables offer values that may be used in the preliminary screening of sediment or other media for toxic hazards.Buchman, M. F. NOAA Quick Screening Reference Tables. NOAA OR&R; Report 08-1 Seattle WA, Office of Response and Restoration Division, National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration (2008): 34 pages. USGS The USGS makes use of both ERL and ERM on a case-by-case basis. During a study involving the concentration of heavy metals, pesticides, and semi-volatile organic compounds in stream sediments from the Schuylkill River within the Valley Forge National Historical Park, the USGS used the ERL and ERM to determine locations that could potentially pose a threat to living organisms.Reif, A., Sloto, R. Metals, Pesticides, and Semi-Volatile Organic Compounds in Sediment in Valley Forge National Historic Park, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. United States Geological Survey. Water Resources Investigations Report (1997): 97-4120. The USGS has also integrated ERL and ERM values into an Alert Range Table, a table that provides ranges of contaminant concentrations that predict the likelihood of adverse effects occurring in benthic organisms for the Lake Pontchartrain Basin in Louisiana.United States Geological Survey. 2002. Lake Pontchartrain Basin: Bottom Sediments and Related Environmental Resources. http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/p1634j/html/fm_range.htm. Accessed June 4, 2012. Both the ERL and ERM have proven to be useful guideline values for predicting toxicity during studies conducted by the USGS. EPA The EPA uses ERL and ERM values as a type of sediment “benchmark”. They define a benchmark as a concentration that, when exceeded, has the potential to cause harm or significant risk to humans or animals in the environment. The EPA has also used ERL and ERM values for sediment contamination studies. Assessment categories defining the condition of sampled sediments have been used by the EPA in the past. Categories have been characterized as “good” for zero ERL exceedances, “intermediate” if there are ERL exceedances but zero ERM exceedances, and “poor” for any ERM exceedance.EPA. 2012. Sediment Contamination. http://www.epa.gov/emap/maia/html/docs/Est5.pdf Accessed: May 24, 2012. The EPA credits the ERL and ERM as valuable benchmarks that assist in providing a uniform context for evaluating contaminant levels within estuaries. Reliability Long and colleagues, using both \\"effects\\" and \\"no effects\\" data, determined measures of the accuracy of the guidelines by calculating the percent incidence of effects occurring within the ranges delineated by ERL/ERM. The percent incidence of effects was calculated by dividing the number of effects entries by the total number of entries and multiplying by 100. For trace metals, the guidelines for copper, lead, and silver were the most accurate - below the ERL concentration, there was less than a 10% incidence of effects. A steady increase was seen between the ERL and ERM concentrations, and above the ERM, the incidence of effects was greater than 83%. The organic contaminant guidelines also appeared to be very accurate for all classes of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and most of the individual PAHs. The incidence of effects was 25% or below when the concentrations were below the respective ERL value, with only (fluorene as an exception, while the incidence of effects was 75% or greater at concentrations above the respective ERM, excepting dibenzo(a,h)anthracene, p,p’-DDE, total dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), and total Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Importantly, one hundred percent effects were seen in concentrations above the ERM for acenaphthylene, 2-methyl naphthalene, and low-molecular weight PAHs, and ninety percent or greater effects in this range were seen for chromium, lead, silver, benz(a)anthracene, and fluoranthene. Contaminants that were reported as having low accuracies included nickel, mercury, chromium, total PCBs, p,p’-DDE, and total DDT. Comparison to other SQGs (case studies) Multiple case studies have been conducted to compare different sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) and their ability to predict sediment toxicity. The original intent of NOAA in developing ERL/ERMs was to create a ranking system for sediment site toxicity in order to compare one site to another.O’Connor, Thomas P. \\"The Sediment Quality Guideline, ERL, Is Not a Chemical Concentration at the Threshold of Sediment Toxicity.\\" Marine Pollution Bulletin 49.5-6 (2004): 383-85. Although not the original intent, these guidelines have been compared to other SQGs to assess their ability to predict sediment toxicity in different organisms. Long and co-workers also Long, Edward R., L. Jay Field, and Donald D. MacDonald. \\"Predicting Toxicity In Marine Sediments With Numerical Sediment Quality Guidelines.\\" Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry 17.4 (1998): 714. conducted a meta-analysis using 1068 sediment toxicity assays to evaluate the predictive ability of the ERL/ERM, PEL (predicted effects level), and TEL (threshold effects level) sediment quality guidelines. They found that the ERL most accurately predicted no-effects toxicity in benthic organisms. Furthermore, it was shown that as the number of SQGs exceeded increased, the resulting toxicity of the sediment increased as well, providing strong evidence that SCGs are useful in predicting sediment toxicities. It was noted, however, that when chemicals existed in mixtures, the toxicity of sediments increased, possibly at concentrations lower than the ERL and TEL. Vidal and Bay Vidal, Doris E., and Steven M. Bay. \\"Comparative Sediment Quality Guideline Performance For Predicting Sediment Toxicity In Southern California, USA.\\" Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry 24.12 (2005): 3173. showed that the ERM performed better than the AET (apparent effects threshold) and EqP (equilibrium partitioning) at predicting a non-toxic sediment concentration, and in general was more conservative in its estimates than the SQGQ1 (sediment quality guideline quotient) and MECq (moderate effects concentration). The purpose of their study was to compare common SQGs used for site assessments in California. Both of these studies suggested using multiple SQGs, and gave guidance on selecting the best method based on site characteristics and the contaminants of immediate concern. Drawbacks to the ERL/ERM approach ERLs and ERMs must be used with caution. Overestimating the ability of these values to signal whether or not sediment may be toxic can lead to poor decisionmaking. Certain considerations must be made, and the weaknesses of these values understood, so that ERL and ERM screening levels are used properly. The ERL and ERM are not threshold values to determine whether toxicity will occur - they are relationships between bulk chemical concentrations and toxicity effects that are expressed along a continuum. There is no concentration above which toxicity will occur and below which toxicity will not occur. This fact may be overlooked by some users of ERL/ERM's, and do so could mislead the decisionmaking process. The derivation of ERL and ERM can also cause further misconceptions - since only effects data is used in determining an ERL/ERM, there are also overlapping concentrations where there is no co-occurrence of toxicity. Concentrations that did not elicit a significant effect are left out of the calculation when determining the 10th and 50th percentile values (ERL and ERM respectively). Therefore, within the ranges delineated by the ERL and ERM values, concentrations exist that were found to not have a significant biological effect. Many substances that are found to be very toxic do not have SQGs associated with them. The ability of an SQG to predict toxicity when other substances, without SQGs, are present, is currently unknown. Particle size also plays an important role in chemical concentrations, and this factor is ignored in calculating the ERL and ERM. When using these values for screening contaminated sediment, it is likely that the ERL will be exceeded more often when the sediment contains a larger proportion of fine-grained material. This is due to the inverse relationship between chemical concentration and particle size. Due to sediment concentrations being measured on a dry weight basis, other geochemical factors of sediment that may also influence contaminant bioavailibility are not considered. Another consideration is that effects to wildlife and humans from bioaccumulation are not considered in ERL and ERM measurements. Furthermore, Vidal and Bay noted that the use of ERMs when DDT is present resulted in a less accurate predictive level. The authors suggested that this provides evidence that other methods could prove more protective in cases where mixtures of organics are present.

He is the president of sporting club Mohammedan SC Limited. He was indicted in many corruption charges and sentenced to 5 years, 13 years, and lifetime imprisonment on different corruption cases. Career The Orion Group was founded by Obaidul Karim during 1985 when he started with Orion Laboratories Ltd. The Group's early growth was driven organically through operations in pharmaceuticals & LVPs and toiletries & cosmetics. In 1993 Orion acquired the then ailing Kohinoor Chemical Co Ltd, manufacturer of the major line of 'Tibet' brand toiletries and beauty care products. Orion has been a producer in the Pharmaceuticals, Cosmetics and Toiletries sectors since 1985 in Bangladesh. More recently, Orion has been focused on Infrastructure Development and Power Generation businesses through major investments and joint ventures. One contribution in the country is the implementation of a 10 km elevated expressway (flyover) in Dhaka. The Orion Group divides their operations into number of Strategic Business Units with multiple subsidiary companies in Agro Products, Cosmetic & Toiletries, Construction and Allied, Energy Sector, Hospitality Management, Infrastructure Development, Pharma & healthcare, Power Generation, Real Estate, Sports & Events and Textiles & Garments. Power operations In December 2011, the Bangladesh Power Development Board announced the signing of three agreements with Orion Group Bangladesh for setting up coal-fired power plants with total capacity of 1,200 megawatt. Orion will build two plants in Khulna and Chittagong with the capacity of 282.67 MW each and one in Munshiganj of 522MW capacity as part of a $1.7 Billion. All three plants will use imported coal to generate electricity. Orion's current HFO fuelled power generation projects of 300MW in the country contribute significantly in mitigating acute power crisis in the country. Infrastructure Orion Group's subsidiary companies are completing the Mayor Mohammad Hanif flyover in Dhaka. The dual carriageway flyover includes 11 slip roads or ramps (exit and entries) and will stretch from the Dhaka- Chittagong highway to Palashi. The contract is estimated to be completed by the end of 2014. City Center Orion has also developed City Center, a major skyscraper in the Dhaka and the tallest building in the country. The City Center project is a 39-storied commercial complex cum car parking in the business area of Dhaka city set to be the highest building in Dhaka.  Controversy = Rise through political contacts  He is said to have succeeded in business because of his closeness to former Prime Minister of Bangladesh Begum Khaleda Zia. Karim acquired two profitable state-owned enterprises (Kohinoor Chemical Industries and Mala Chemical Industries a.k.a Orion Infusions) in the 1990s. In 1996, before the stock market collapsed later in the year, Orion announced large dividends and bonuses for their shareholders, pushing up their stock prices. However, after the market collapsed, the company did not produce any dividends or bonuses for their shareholders. After this happened, the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission filed a case against him which was ineffective. Investigations showed that between 2001-2006, Karim large businesses and projects and also got involved in many financial scams. Most of the contracts won were awarded to him by the BNP government by manipulating tenders and violating rules.  Corruption  He initially won the contract to construct the Gulistan- Jatrabari flyover through his construction firm Belhasa Accom and Associates. However this fell apart because there were better offers on the market. Yet the contract was returned to Karim because of his close connections with Khaleda Zia and Tarique Rahman. Huge bribed were given to many well known politicians including a luxury SUV which was \\"gifted\\" to Harris Chowdhury, personal secretary of Khaleda Zia. He also gave a house in the USA to a top government politician. In June 2008, Karim was sentenced to 13 years of rigorous imprisonment on charges of amassing wealth illegally and hiding information on his assets. He was fined Tk. 1 million and had assets worth Tk. 50.92 crore confiscated.  Oriental Bank scam  In December 2007, Karim was sentenced to life imprisonment by a special court for misappropriating Tk 6.7 crore from the Oriental Bank (presently ICB Islamic Bank). He was fined the same amount or two years of extended jail time if he failed to pay the fine. Karim, who was one of the banks sponsors, had the assistance of two bank officials. They opened a fake account in 2005 at Oriental Bank's principal branch with a deposit of Tk. 75 thousand. The account was opened under the name of a certain Bellal Hossain. After an investigation it was revealed that nobody named Bellal Hossain existed and it was actually a dummy account. In total, Karim and his associated in the bank embezzled around Tk. 700 crore from the Oriental Bank. Most of the money was embezzled through One Denim Mills and One Entertainment, both of which were owned by Giasuddin Al Mamun.

It opened on 16 December 1897 to serve the wharves and industries along the western bank of the Bulimba Reach of the Brisbane River at Newstead and Bulimba (which at the time straddled both sides of the Brisbane River). Even after the parts of Bulimba on the northern side of the river became the suburbs of Teneriffe and New Farm, it continued to be known as the Bulimba Branch until closure in 1990. Route The branch ran from a junction at Brunswick Street station and ran parallel to the North Coast line to near the original site of Bowen Hills railway station. A junction known as Bulimba Junction at the south end of Bowen Hills was added in 1914. It ran to the Brisbane City Council Power House Siding, serving 23 industries and wharves along the way (increasing to 24 in 1913 and 27 in 1950). Closure Newstead Wharves were closed in 1977 and the sidings removed. Brown and Broad Siding was removed in 1980. The line was closed south of Commercial Road on 1 November 1989 and the remainder back to Bulimba Junction closed on 30 April 1990.

The show has typically aired in the late afternoon time slot on weekdays, currently (as of 2020) from 6pm to 7pm. Daily podcasts of each show are made available as well as show content being shared on social media pages and the Triple M website. History The show commenced in April 2010, initially only airing Tuesday to Thursday each week, with Dave 'Higgo' Higgins anchoring the show, along with numerous other Triple M anchors taking over throughout the years. Regular guests that visit the show from time to time have included Wayne Carey, Damien Barrett, Jason Dunstall, Danny Frawley, Brian Taylor, Chris Judd, Nathan Brown and Brigitte \\"Top Flight\\" Duclos In 2011, the show was expanded to run from Monday to Friday, after Roy and HG's departure freed up time slot space. Over the years the length of the show and the airtime has been changed, with various time slots consisting of 3pm to 5pm, 4pm to 5pm as well as 4pm to 6pm. In 2018, the show moved to a 2pm to 4pm time slot, to accommodate the new Kennedy Molloy show, which airs from 4pm to 6pm. The 2020 season saw the show shortened to 60 minutes and move to the 6pm - 7pm time slot. Regular segments The show centers around several regular segments, current events discussion (especially involving sports) and celebrity interviews (usually AFL footballers, past and present.)  Topics Brownless / Brayshaw  JB or Billy comes up with a question or topic of discussion, and invites listeners to call in and give answers or tell their story, with prizes being given to the best responses. Billy is known for usually ending his topic questions with \\"...unusual?!\\" e.g. \\"What have you eaten, unusual?!\\" Billy's Bake A segment where Billy rants about an issue that has been annoying him of late. The rant is usually full of profanities and is presented in an exaggerated manner. The Idiot File The self-proclaimed favourite segment of the show's listeners, this segment features a supercut of all of Billy's on-air incorrect use of grammar, mispronunciations and stuff-ups from the previous week. Usually airs towards the end of Friday shows. More recently, the clips have been integrated into a song. Damo's Recovery Session On Mondays, Damian Barrett helps to dissect the previous weekend's round of AFL. The Mid Week Rub Towards the end of the show on Wednesdays, Damian Barrett and another guest, usually Brian Taylor, Jason Dunstall or Nathan Brown talk about the latest AFL news and share opinions. Friday Brag Artist A regular segment on Fridays, where listeners are asked to call in and explain why their chosen personal achievement should be celebrated. A snippet of \\"Unbelievable\\" by EMF gets played after each response.

Across all three campuses, the 2300 students are supported by approximately 300 staff. The College is run and administered by the New South Wales Department of Education. The College Principal is Ms Kylee Owen and each campus has a principal.  History  A 1999 analysis of School Certificate and Higher School Certificate results and other data including demographic studies, enrolment and exit destination statistics at the Jesmond High School, Wallsend High School and Waratah High School, revealed many similarities and patterns of results. Following consultation with parents, citizens, staff and students, the Government of New South Wales made a decision to merge the three schools and establish Callaghan under a collegiate structure. The Waratah Campus was originally occupied by Newcastle Boys' High School, a selective single sex high school for boys that operated on the site from 1934 to the end of 1976. At the beginning of 1976 the school became non-selective and co-educational for students in years 7–11, and in 1977 changed its name to Waratah High School. Later the name was changed to Waratah Technology High School, which persisted until the change to Waratah Technology Campus in 2000 upon the formation of Callaghan College. It changed names again in 2020 to just Waratah Campus. Despite numerous other changes, the school retains the original Newcastle Boys' High School house names of Hannell Devils (red), Hunter Tigers (yellow), Shortland Vipers (green), and Smith Sharks (blue). At the start of 2020 a rebranding occurred. The old 3 ring logo was replaced with 3 white or navy blue circles. The campus main colours were changed: Jesmond - black to yellow, Wallsend - Dark blue to a brighter blue and Waratah - Maroon to a brighter red.

It fundamentally means translating the meaning of each whole sentence before moving on to the next, and stands in normative opposition to word-for-word translation (also known as literal translation). History Jerome, a Roman Catholic priest, theologian, and historian coined the term \\"sense-for-sense\\" when he developed this translation method when was tasked by Pope Damasus to review the existing translations of the Gospel and produce a more reliable Latin version. He described this method in his \\"Letter to Pammachius\\", where he said that, \\"except of course in the case of Holy Scripture, where even the syntax contains a mystery,\\" he translates non verbum e verbo sed sensum de sensu: not word for word but sense for sense.Douglas Robinson, ed., Western Translation Theory from Herodotus to Nietzsche (Manchester, UK: St. Jerome, 1997, 2ed 2002), 25. He adopted a framework that corrected the mistakes of previous translators as well as the alterations of critical scholars and the errors made by careless copyists by collecting the oldest Greek manuscripts, which he compared with the Old Latin versions, and translated the scripture into a version that is close as possible to the original meaning. Jerome did not invent the concept of sense-for-sense translation. It is believed that it was first proposed by Cicero in De optimo genere oratorum (\\"The Best Kind of Orator\\"). In this text, he said that in translating from Greek to Latin, \\"I did not think I ought to count them out to the reader like coins, but to pay them by weight, as it were.\\"Robinson, ed., Western Translation Theory, 9. Cicero did not mention sense-for-sense in his works but it is considered to be a type of \\"segmental\\" theory, which is attributed to him and Horace. This translation approach is based on segmentation, which considers the how long a segment (word, phrase, or sentence) is before moving on to the next. Jerome was not the originator of the term \\"word-for-word\\" either. It has possibly also been borrowed from Cicero as well, or possibly from Horace, who warned the writer interested in retelling ancient tales in an original way Nec verbo verbum curabit reddere / fidus interpretes: \\"not to try to render them word for word [like some] faithful translator.\\"Robinson, ed., Western Translation Theory, 15. Some have read that passage in Horace differently. Boethius in 510 CE and Johannes Scotus Eriugena in the mid-9th century read it to mean that translating literally is \\"the fault/blame of the faithful interpreter/translator,\\" and fear that they have incurred it. Burgundio of Pisa in the 1170s and Sir Richard Sherburne in 1702 recognize that Horace is advising not translators but original writers, but still assume that he is calling all translation literal. Finally, John Denham in 1656 and André Lefevere in 1992 take Horace to be warning translators against translating literally.For Boethius, Eriugena, Burgundio, and Denham, see Robinson, ed., Western Translation Theory, 35, 37, 42, and 156. For Sherburne, see T. R. Steiner, English Translation Theory, 1650–1800 (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 1975), 89. André Lefevere's translation of Horace appears in Lefevere, ed., Translation/History/Culture: A Sourcebook (London and New York: Routledge, 1992), 15: \\"Do not worry about rendering word for word, faithful translator, but render sense for sense.\\" This of course not only makes Horace's advice for the writer into advice for the translator, but anachronistically imports Jerome's coinage back into Horace's dictum, which actually preceded it by four centuries. For discussion, see also Douglas Robinson, Who Translates (Albany: SUNY Press, 2001), 170–174. Similar concepts= Paraphrase  John Dryden by Sir Godfrey Kneller In John Dryden’s 1680 preface to his translation of Ovid's Epistles, he proposed dividing translation into three parts called: metaphrase, paraphrase and imitation.Lawrence Venuti, The Translation Studies Reader. 3rd ed. (New York: Routledge, 2012.), page 38. Metaphrase is word-for- word and line by line translation from one language into another.Venuti, The Translation Studies Reader, 3rd ed., 38. Paraphrase is sense-for-sense translation where the message of the author is kept but his words are not so strictly followed as his sense, which too can be altered or amplified.Venuti, The Translation Studies Reader, 3rd ed., 38. Imitation is the use of either metaphrase or paraphrase but the translator has the liberty to choose which is appropriate and how the message will be conveyed.Venuti, The Translation Studies Reader, 3rd ed., 38.  Leaving the reader in peace  In 1813, during his “Über die Verschiedenen Methoden des Übersetzens” lecture,Yves Gambier, Luc Van Doorslaer, Handbook of Translation Studies, (Amsterdam: John Benjamins Pub., 2010.), 40. Friedrich Schleiermacher proposed the idea where “[E]ither the translator leaves the author in peace, as much as possible, and moves the reader towards him, or he leaves the reader in peace, as much as possible, and he moves the author towards him”.Gambier, Handbook of Translation Studies, 40.  Dynamic equivalence  In 1964, Eugene Nida described translation as having two different types of equivalence: formal and dynamic equivalence.Lawrence Venuti,. The Translation Studies Reader. (New York: Routledge, 2000.), page 129. Formal equivalence is when there is focus on the message itself (in both form and content);Lawrence Venuti, The Translation Studies Reader. (New York: Routledge, 2000.), page 129. the message in the target language should match the message in the source language as closely as possible.Venuti, The Translation Studies Reader, 129. In dynamic equivalence, there is less concern with matching the message in the target language with the message in the source language;Venuti, The Translation Studies Reader, 129. the goal is to produce the same relationship between target text and target audience as there was with the original source text and its audience.Venuti, The Translation Studies Reader, 129.  Communicative translation  In 1981, Peter Newmark referred to translation as either semantic (word-for-word) or communicative (sense-for-sense).Peter Newmark, Approaches to Translation, (Oxford: Pergamon Press, 1981) He stated that semantic translation is one that is source language bias, literal and faithful to the source text and communicative translation is target language bias, free and idiomatic.Newmark, Approaches to Translation, 31 A semantic translation's goal is to stay as close as possible to the semantic and syntactic structures of the source language, allowing the exact contextual meaning of the original.Newmark, Approaches to Translation, 39 A communicative translation's goal is to produce an effect on the readers as close as possible to that as produced upon the readers of the original.Newmark, Approaches to Translation, 39  Idiomatic translation  In addition to these concepts, in 1990, Brian Mossop presented his concept of idiomatic and unidiomatic translation.Brian Mossop, \\"Translating Institutions and “Idiomatic” Translation.\\" Meta: Journal des traducteurs 35, no. 2 (January 1990) Idiomatic translation is when the message of the source text is conveyed the way a target language writer would convey it, rather than staying to the way in which it was conveyed in the source text.Mossop, “Translating Institutions,”, 343 Unidiomatic translation is innovative and translates individual words.Mossop, “Translating Institutions,”, 343 Lawrence Venuti  Domesticated translation  In 1994, also in modern Translation Studies, Lawrence Venuti introduced the concepts of domestication and foreignization, which are based on concepts from Friedrich Schleiermacher's 1813 lecture.Gambier, Handbook of Translation Studies, 40. Domestication is the adaption of culture-specific terms or cultural context, where as foreignization is the preservation of the original cultural context of the source text (in terms of settings, names, etc.).Gambier, Handbook of Translation Studies, 40. Venuti also described domestication as being fluent and transparent strategies that result in acculturation,Gambier, Handbook of Translation Studies, 40. where “a cultural other is domesticated, made intelligible”.Lawrence Venuti, \\"Genealogies of Translation Theory: Schleiermacher.\\" TTR : Traduction, Terminologie, Rédaction 4, no. 2 (1991) Schleiermacher's distinction between \\"bringing the author to the reader\\" (domestication) and \\"taking the reader to the author\\"Douglas Robinson, ed. Western Translation Theory From Herodotus to Nietzsche. (Manchester: St. Jerome., 2002) (foreignization), dealt with a social concern and Venuti's distinction between domestication and foreignization deals with ethical principles.Gambier, Handbook of Translation Studies, 40.

Etymology Miangas means \\"exposed to piracy\\", because pirates from Mindanao used to visit the island. In the 16th century, the island was named in Spanish Isla de las Palmas, and in Portuguese Ilha de Palmeiras. In the Sasahara language, the island is called Tinonda or Poilaten in Minahasan which mean \\"people who live separated from the main archipelago\\" and \\"our island\\" respectively. History According to local tradition, there were a number of kingdoms in the area. Sangir, Talaud and Sitaro belonged to two kingdoms, Tabukan and Kalongan. To justify their sovereignty over Miangas, the Dutch argued that the island had been under the domination of the princes of Sangir.M. P. H. Roessingh, \\"Dutch relations with the Philippines:a survey of sources in the General States Archives, The Hague, Netherlands\\", Asian Studies 5, No. 2, pp. 377-407 First Europeans Giolo (real name Jeoly) of Miangas, who became a slave in Mindanao, and bought by William Dampier together with Jeoly's mother, who died at sea. Jeoly was exhibited in London in 1691 for money as a one-man human zoo, until he died of smallpox three months later.https://www.esquiremag.ph/long-reads/features/the-true-story-of-the- mindanaoan-slave-whose-skin-was-displayed-at-oxford-a00029-20171102-lfrm2 In October 1526, Garcia Jofre de Loaísa, Spanish sailor and researcher, was the first European to visit the island. The island was used as a defense site by Talaud people when under attack from the Sulu Sultanate. The island was affected by the outbreak of cholera in 1885, causing hundreds of the inhabitants to move to Karakelang Island. In 1895, E. J. Jellesma, Oud- resident of Manado, visited Miangas to praise the residents and kapiten laut for rejecting the Spanish flag. Jellesma gave them a medal and a Dutch flag. With Jellesma was Pastor Kroll, who baptized 254 residents as Protestants. After Jellesma's visit, a Tahuna assistant resident and Pastor Pannings visited the island in April and October 1909. Island of Palmas Case According to the Treaty of Paris, the Philippines area was all areas within a large geographic box. Miangas lay inside the southern boundary of the box. On 21 January 1906, General Leonard Wood, Governor General of Moro, officially visited the island for the first time. He found the Dutch flag already flew there and that the island was claimed as part of the Dutch East Indies. When Wood returned to Zamboanga, he reported it to the United States Military Secretary, on 26 January 1906. The United States government referred the matter to the Netherlands through their embassy in The Hague on 31 March 1906. On 17 October 1906 the Netherlands Foreign Ministry responded with reasons why the island was included in the Dutch East Indies. On 23 January 1925 the Netherlands and the United States brought the case to the Permanent Court of Arbitration, under a sole arbitrator Max Huber of Switzerland. On 4 April 1928 Huber decided that the island \\"forms in its entirety a part of Netherlands territory\\". It was reported in 2003 that Philippine congressman Harry Roque argues that Spain could not have legally ceded Palmas or any part of the Philippines to the United States because Filipinos had already established the Republic of the Philippines on June 12, 1898 before the Treaty of Paris was signed on Dec. 10, 1898. Post Indonesian independence On 4 July 1956, Indonesia, represented by Ambassador Soehardjo Wirjopranoto, and the Philippines, represented by Ambassador Jose T. Fuentebella, signed the Agreement on Immigration Between the Republic of the Philippines and the Republic of Indonesia, that allowed border residents in Sangihe, Talaud, Nunukan, Balut, and Sarangani, who had a laissez-passer, to cross the border to trade, visit family, worship, and travel. On 16 September 1965, Jusuf Ronodipuro of Indonesia and Leon T. Garcia of the Philippines signed a Directives and Guidelines on the Implementation of the Immigration Agreement on Repatriation and Border Crossing Arrangement Between Republic of Indonesia and the Republic of the Philippines, which clarify the first agreement, making Marore, Miangas, Mabila, and Balut the checkpoints. In 1972, the island was hit by a tsunami, and 90 householders were moved by the government to Bolaang- Mongondow Regency as a result. In 2005, the Indonesian government refused a shipping line from Miangas to Davao (part of the Philippines). In the same year, Miangas Village Secretary Jhonlyi Awala died from a beating at the hands of the Chief of Police of Miangas. About 200 people, dressed in black, demonstrated to express their outrage at the senseless death and the island's neglect by the Indonesian state. They lowered the Indonesian flag at the Miangas pier and instead raised the Philippine flag. Talaud Regent Elly Engelbert Lasut, who arrived from Manado, de-escalated the situation. According to Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Indonesia), Philippine Tourism Authority in February 2009 published a map which included Miangas into the Philippines' territory. A monument, named Monumen Patung Santiago (Monument Statue of Santiago), was built on the island in 2010 to commemorate Santiago who defended the island from the Dutch colonials. In 2011, the island could be reached by ship operated by Pelni. In 2014, both the governments of the Philippines and Indonesia officially demarcated their maritime borders, with Miangas recognized as within the waters of Indonesia. Starting from 12 March 2017, a flight from Manado serves this island once a week. The flight, operated by Wings Air, lands at Miangas Airport every Sunday. Geography Miangas is located from Manado, the capital of North Sulawesi and from Davao City in the Philippines. It also lies southeast of Mindanao. It is long and wide, with an area of 3.15 km2. Miangas, which lies to the north of the Nanusa Islands, forms a separate district within the Talaud Islands Regency. The island is mainly lowland, about 1.5 metres above sea level. The highest point, called Gunung Batu, is 111 metres high, located in the northeast part of the island. This area is covered with coconut palm. In the northeast corner of the island, there is a cliff, with the northeast shore fringed by a reef. Transportation Miangas Airport was opened by President Joko Widodo. For transportation, Miangas inhabitants once relied on their homemade sailboats. During the New Order, however, they started using motorboats. These are now the main sources of transportation. In October 2016, Miangas Airport inaugurated by the President Joko Widodo. An inaugural flight serves this airport several months later. Economy Miangas inhabitants derive their main income from fishing. Women also weave mats from pandan leaves. Demography As at the 2010 Census, the island's population was 728 people. Miangas inhabitants speak Indonesian and Bisaya; the older generation usually also speak Tagalog. The island has a police station and two military posts. There are also a market, a harbor office and a bank office.

The rebellion took place in the central part of the archipelago. Background The Huilliches of Chiloé had already taken action against their Spanish lords back in 1600. In that year a group helped the Dutch corsair Baltazar de Cordes attack the Spanish settlement of Castro. Unlike in continental Chile, the indigenous population of Chiloé grew from 1700 onwards. By 1712 indigenous peoples made up around 50% of the population of the archipelago. The encomiendas of Chiloé were the largest of Chile and the administration of this form of labor more abusive than on the mainland. Moreover, the encomenderos did not fulfill their obligations; they did not register tribute nor salaries. Encomenderos often did not pay legal salaries or salaries at all and did not observe the \\"free time\\" of Indians in the encomienda laws. The encomienda activities in Chiloé included the Indians traveling to the continental coast to log for alerce wood. In retrospect, the Huilliches considered the abuses of José de Andrade a trigger of the rebellion, in particular the whipping of Martín Antucan, an Indian he tied to an apple tree and then flogged his genitals with nettles, to be then covered in tow and set afire. According to testimonies gathered in 1725 José de Andrade judged wrongdoings himself, did not pay salaries, and tortured those who did not work due to illness. His son is reported to have had similar behaviors and his majordomo kidnapped children to send them to continental Chile. During a meeting on 26 January 1712 the Huilliches set 10 February as the date of their uprising. The objective of the rebellion was not the end of Spanish rule but vengeance for perceived injustices. Rebellion The strategy of the rebellion focused on attacking Castro, the political and economic center of the islands which was also where most Spaniards lived and where most encomiendas were. On the night of 10 February, houses and haciendas of Spaniards in central Chiloé were attacked; Spaniards were killed and buildings set afire. Some Spaniards managed to fortify themselves in Castro while they were surrounded by rebels. Spanish women and children were taken as prisoners. On the first night of rebellion only notable Spaniards died, no Spaniards of low social standing or mestizos, friars or priests were attacked. Other Spaniards survived hidden in the forests. The same day Spanish captains Juan de Aguilar and Diego Telles de Barrientos began to crush the rebellion. They subsequently fought in different places of Chiloé for eight days. Also on 10 February a Spanish militia began to kill Huilliches and were only stopped by the intervention of Jesuits. Following the crushing of the rebellion a small group of Huilliches departed to the Guaitecas Archipelago to avoid harsh Spanish reprimands. Other insurgents sought refuge from the Spanish reprisal with Father Manuel del Hoyo in the Mission of Nahuel Huapi across the Andes. Aftermath José Marín de Velasco, the Royal Governor of Chiloé, was suspended from his duties after the rebellion. However, he later obtained the approval of the King of Spain and returned to rule Chiloé in 1715, aiming to put the encomienda system under the rule of law. Indigenous complaints to the Spanish authorities increased after the rebellion. The encomienda system was abolished in 1782 in Chiloé, the rest of Chile in 1789, and in 1791, the whole Spanish Empire.

The compound can be found in celery, garden angelica, parsnip, fruits and in the rind and pulp of limes. Several studies have looked into the effects of isopimpinellin and other furanocoumarins (such as bergamottin and imperatorin) as anticarcinogens. These studies have shown possible inhibition of 7,12-Dimethylbenz(a)anthracene, which are initiators of skin tumors. Evidence has also been reported that links these compounds to the inhibition of breast cancers.

Believing the general store's safe contained a mining payroll of $7,000, they timed the robbery incorrectly and were only able to steal between $800 to $3,000, along with a gold watch and jewelry. During the robbery, members of the gang killed four people, including a lawman and a pregnant woman. Six men were convicted of the robbery and murders. John Heath, who was accused of organizing the robbery, was tried separately and sentenced to life in prison. The other five men were convicted of murder and sentenced to hang. Unsatisfied with Heath's sentence, a lynch mob forcibly removed Heath from jail and hanged him from a telegraph pole on February 22, 1884. The other five men were executed on March 28, 1884. They were the first criminals to be legally hanged in Tombstone. The graves of the five murderers is part of the popular Boothill Graveyard tourist attraction in Tombstone.  Background  John T. Heath was born in Texas in 1855 to John and Sarah Heath. His family moved to Louisiana while he was young. The family eventually returned to Texas and in 1875 Heath married Virginia Tennessee “Jennie” Ferrell. In 1882, Heath left Texas, settling first in Clifton, Arizona, where he opened a saloon. In November 1883, Heath moved to Bisbee with James \\"Tex\\" Howard. Along the way, Heath and Howard met friends of Howard: Dan \\"Big Dan\\" Dowd, Omer W. \\"Red\\" Sample, and Daniel \\"York\\" Kelly. As an adult, Heath was indicted for cattle rustling, robbery, burglary, and running a house of prostitution. Bisbee didn't have a bank, and it was common knowledge that the $7,000 cash payroll (or about $ today) for the Copper Queen Mine was delivered to the Goldwater & Castaneda Mercantile store one or two days in advance of the company's payday on the 10th of each month. Heath was later convicted of arranging for Cowboys Daniel W. \\"Big Dan\\" Dowd, Omer W. \\"Red\\" Sample, Daniel \\"York\\" Kelly, William E. \\"Billy\\" Delaney, and James \\"Tex\\" Howard to rob the store and payroll. Before the robbery, Heath allegedly accompanied Howard and the three other men to Buckles' ranch, about outside Bisbee, although no witnesses were later found to corroborate Heath's role. Heath and Howard continued on to Bisbee on November 20, 1883. Heath immediately partnered with a local man named Nathan Waite and prepared to open a new dance hall. Howard returned to the Buckles' ranch and waited with his confederates. Heath and Waite opened their dance hall behind the Goldwater & Castaneda Mercantile general store on December 8, 1883, the day the Copper Queen Mine payroll usually arrived.  Robbery and murders  The Letson Loft Hotel (Letson Loft Block) located on 26 Main Street was where the Goldwater–Castaneda Mercantile Store was originally located. The building is listed in the National Register of Historic Places on July 3, 1980, as part of the Bisbee Historic District, reference #80004487. On the evening of December 8, 1883, the five outlaws rode into Bisbee. They tied their horses near the Copper Queen Mine smelter at the end of Main Street and walked to the Goldwater and Castaneda store. At the store, three of the men, including \\"Tex\\" Howard, who wasn't wearing a mask, entered the store while the other two remained outside. They leveled pistols at the store owner and persuaded him to open the safe, only to find that the payroll had not yet arrived. The robbers took some cash and a gold watch in the safe and robbed all of the employees and customers in the store. Accounts differ as to how much money they stole, but it was reported they took between $800 and $3,000 in cash along with the gold watch and jewelry. While three Cowboys were inside looting the safe and robbing the customers, two Cowboys outside were confronted by citizens who recognized that a robbery was in progress. When assayer J. C. Tappenier exited the Bon Ton Saloon next door, they ordered him to go back in. He refused and the robbers, armed with Winchester repeating rifles, killed him with a shot to the head. Cochise County Deputy Sheriff D. Tom Smith was having dinner with his wife across the street at the Bisbee House. He ran onto the street and the robbers ordered him to go back inside. Smith refused, and told them he was an officer of the law. One of the bandits reportedly said, \\"Then you are the one we want!\\" and killed him. He fell beneath a freight wagon. Annie Roberts, who was pregnant, came to the door of the Bisbee House restaurant, which she and her husband owned. The Cowboys shot her and the bullet shattered her spine, mortally wounding her. John A. Nolly, a local freighter, was standing near his wagon when he was shot in the chest. A local man, known only as \\"Indian Joe,\\" was wounded in the leg as he was trying to escape the shooting. Roberts and Nolly died later that evening.Tombstone Republican February 10 and 23, 1884 The robbers exited the store and ran for their horses, firing at anyone they saw. Deputy Sheriff William \\"Billy\\" Daniels, who had come from his saloon when he heard the shooting commence, emptied his revolver at the fleeing outlaws, but missed. The bandits mounted their horses and rode back up Main Street, over Mule Pass, and out of town. At Soldier's Hole, a site east of Bisbee, they divided the money and went their separate ways.  Posse captures suspects  The Copper Queen Mine offered a reward of $2,000 for the arrest and conviction of the Cowboys. Since four of the robbers wore masks, it was at first difficult to trace them. Riders from Bisbee immediately left for the county seat in Tombstone to notify Cochise County Sheriff Jerome L. Ward. Deputy Daniels immediately formed two posses. The first posse immediately left in pursuit of the murderers. It included John Heath who was later convicted of planning the robbery. He rode with Nathan Waite and Henry Frost (a local gambler and acquaintance of John Heath). Waite and Heath were deputized by Daniels. The second posse rode out after daybreak on December 9. Daniels' posse soon caught up with Heath's posse. During the manhunt, Heath noticed that the outlaws' tracks separated with three horsemen going east and the two others going south. Heath brought this to Daniel's attention, but Daniels didn't believe Heath. Heath, Waite, and Frost followed the southbound tracks and finally lost the trail of their quarry outside Tombstone. Daniels doggedly followed the other tracks and eventually lost that trail. He returned to Bisbee empty-handed. Exhausted, the three men spent the night in Tombstone. Since Sheriff Ward was absent, they met with Under-Sheriff Wallace, and then returned to Bisbee. Heath and Waite were arrested the following day. Waite was released, but Heath was held in jail as a suspected accomplice.The Tombstone Republican 23 February 1884The Tombstone Epitaph 17 February 1884 When Heath was tried for his role in the robbery, Daniels testified that Heath was trying to mislead the posse when he pointed out that the trail had split. Because he had neglected to wear a mask, \\"Tex\\" Howard was quickly identified as one of the robbers. After further investigation, Deputy Daniels was able to determine the names of the other four men suspected of being involved. Suspicion fell upon Heath as he was acquainted with Howard and had been seen in the company of the other four men at Buckles' ranch. The first of the outlaws to be apprehended was Daniel \\"York\\" Kelly. Kelly was caught near Deming, New Mexico. \\"Tex\\" Howard and \\"Red\\" Sample made the mistake of returning to their old haunts in Clifton, Arizona. While there, the outlaws visited with bartender Walter Bush. After the two men left town, Bush notified authorities. A posse was assembled and within a matter of days, Howard and Sample were captured and placed in jail. Daniel W. Dowd and William E. Delaney had, as Heath had seen by their horse tracks, left the others outside Bisbee and traveled to Sonora, Mexico. Dan Dowd was captured by Deputy Daniels across the Mexican border in Los Corralitos, Sonora. William Delaney was apprehended by Deputy Daniels with the aid of Deputy Sheriff Robert Hatch in the town of Minas Prietas, Sonora where he had been detained after getting in a brawl with a local mine foreman.Tombstone Republican 19 January 1884 Given the reward, Mexican authorities were glad to release him to the Americans.  Five Cowboys convicted  On February 6, the grand jury \\"found indictments against Dowd, Kelly, Sample, Howard and Delaney\\". The men appointed as their legal counsel included James B. Southard, Col. Stanford, Thomas J. Drum, F. V. Price, and Col. William Herring (father of Sarah Herring Sorin, one of Arizona's first female attorneys). The trial of the five suspected killers began in Tombstone on February 17, 1884. The evidence against the men was fairly conclusive. Four of the five of them had been recognized either during the robbery or as they ran from the mercantile. Additionally, there was a chain of physical and circumstantial evidence linking the men to the crime. The trial lasted only three days. After an hour's deliberation the jury brought back a verdict of guilty of first-degree murder. On hearing the verdict, Daniel Kelly was reported to have remarked, \\"Well boys, hemp seems to be trumps\\". On February 18, after their motions for a new trial were quashed by Judge Daniel Pinney, the five outlaws were sentenced to be hanged by the neck until they were dead.The Tombstone Epitaph 12 February 1884The Tombstone Republican. 16 February 1884  John Heath convicted  The lynching of John Heath on February 22, 1884 At his request, John Heath was tried separately beginning on February 12, 1884. He was represented by Colonel William Herring. The prosecutors could not produce a witness who could tie Heath to the robbery. Certainly he had known the outlaws previously, but proving he had conspired with them was problematic. Unable to produce a witness, County Attorney Marcus Aurelius Smith found a prisoner to testify against Heath. Sergeant L. D. Lawrence, of the 3rd Cavalry, had been indicted for killing two men during a saloon brawl in Willcox, Arizona, and had been incarcerated with Heath and the others since their arrest. Sgt. Lawrence swore he had heard Heath and the outlaws discuss the robbery and how and why their plan had failed. Heath's attorney questioned Lawrence as to whether he had made a deal with County Attorney Smith to testify against Heath in exchange for a lighter sentence in his own case. Lawrence swore he had not but three months later, in May 1884, he was represented in his murder trial before Judge Pinney by Smith's private law firm. He was found guilty of the lesser crime of manslaughter and sentenced to only two years in the Yuma Territorial Prison.The Tombstone Epitaph. 17 February 1884\\"Territory of Arizona vs. L. D. Lawrence. Case 170\\"The Arizona Weekly Citizen 17 May 1884 The jury, which split several times over the verdict, with some calling for conviction and some calling for acquittal, finally chose a \\"compromise verdict\\" and convicted Heath of second- degree murder The Tombstone Epitaph 20 February 1884 Judge Pinney sentenced him to life at the Yuma Territorial Prison.  Heath lynched  Some men of Cochise County were not satisfied. On February 22, a large lynch mob, reported as 50 to 150 men, mostly miners, armed themselves. They appointed a committee of seven men to enter the county jail in the Tombstone Courthouse and get Heath out. The jailer thought their knock was the Chinese cook bringing breakfast, and the seven men forced the sheriff and guards at the point of their guns to release Heath to them. The mob took Heath from the jail, leaving his five convicted associates who were scheduled to be executed in March. As the mob exited the courthouse with the prisoner, Sheriff Ward attempted to intervene. The mob pushed him aside.The Arizona Weekly Citizen, 1 March 1884 The mob took Heath down Toughnut Street and lynched him from a telegraph pole at the corner of First and Toughnut Streets. Heath's last words were: His executioners agreed. Heath was then blindfolded and the noose was placed around his neck. Members of the mob then pulled the rope until Heath was suspended beneath the pole, where he slowly strangled to death. When the body finally came to rest, someone placed a placard on the telegraph pole bearing the inscription:  Newspaper accounts  The lynching at Tombstone was covered nationally, reported by The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune as well as by western newspapers. The February 24, 1884 issue of the Times reported: Heath restated his innocence before the crowd put the rope around his neck and hoisted him off his feet.\\"Bisbee Massacre Historical Text\\" - Page 2 , \\"How An Arizona Mob Disposed Of One Of The Bisbee Murderers\\", The New York Times, 24 February 1884, at Legends of America website, accessed 18 August 2014 The mob left Heath \\"hanging for half an hour, when he was cut down\\". After his death, Heath was described as \\"a notorious gambler, burglar, horse and cattle thief\\" on February 28, 1884, by The Kaufman Sun in his home town of Terrell, Texas.\\"Bisbee Massacre Historical Text\\" - Page 2 , The Kaufman Sun, 28 February 1884, at Legends of America website  Coroner's verdict  The grave marker for John Heath at the Boothill Graveyard in Tombstone, Arizona Dr. George E. Goodfellow, who had witnessed Heath's hanging, was County Coroner and responsible for determining the cause of death. His conclusion reflected the popular sentiment of the town. He ruled that Heath died from \\"...emphysema of the lungs which might have been, and probably was, caused by strangulation, self-inflicted or otherwise, as in accordance with the medical evidence.\\" While a grave marker for John Heath is currently located in the Tombstone Boothill Graveyard, his body was returned to his family in Terrell, Texas, where he was buried at the Oakland Cemetery in an unmarked grave.  Remaining five executed  After the trial and conviction of the five bandits, residents celebrated the day of their execution in March 1884. Sheriff Ward sent out invitations to a select number of people to view the hanging, In addition, a local businessman erected a grandstand of his own outside the jailyard and began selling tickets at $1.50 per seat. Nellie Cashman, a local philanthropist, was disgusted when she learned of these plans. She protested to Sheriff Ward, but he would not act. On the day before the executions, she and others she recruited chopped up the grandstand. During this row, seven people were injured, one breaking a leg and another an arm. According to the Tombstone Epitaph, about 1,000 persons witnessed the hangings. A special gallows was built that could accommodate all five of the outlaws. On the morning of their execution, they were shaved and dressed in matching black suits. Sheriff Ward allowed them to walk unfettered to the gibbet and to wear their hats. Once on the platform, the men were bound again. Each of the bandits protested his innocence and that of Heath, who had been lynched a month earlier. A plaque at the Tombstone Courthouse State Historic Park listing the names of the men hanged in Tombstone Having converted to Catholicism during their tenure in the county jail, the outlaws asked for their bodies to be delivered to the local Roman Catholic priest, Father Gallagher. Their hats were then taken from them and black hoods pulled down over their heads. The nooses were subsequently adjusted around their necks. It was then that Daniel \\"York\\" Kelly, his voice muffled by the hood which covered his features, said, \\"Let her go!\\" On March 28, 1884, at 1:18 p.m. James \\"Tex\\" Howard, Dan \\"Big Dan\\" Dowd, William Delaney (or DeLaney), Omer W. \\"Red\\" Sample, and Kelly were executed. They were dropped together and, except for Dowd, died quickly. Dowd's body was seen to twitch and jerk for several minutes as he strangled to death. The bodies of the Bisbee bandits were allowed to hang there in the early spring air for a full half-hour before they were officially pronounced dead. Then, at 1:45 p.m. the corpses were cut down and “placed in neat but plain coffins” and conveyed to the city morgue, where they were each identified in turn by Gallagher.\\"Dancing on Air\\". The Tombstone Republican. March 28, 1884. Learning that a medical school intended to exhume the bandits' corpses for research, Cashman intervened, hiring two miners to guard the graves of the bandits for ten days.

After many months of silence, Shadie Elnashai released a statement on his personal website denying all charges. Elnashai cited the investigation's lack of findings as proof of his innocence. However, the board of directors at Cinefamily did not released the findings of the investigation, so this is not verifiable.

History Poema del Iguazú was written in 1943, and is the last of three orchestral \\"poems\\" by Williams. Its earlier companions are Poema de las campanas, op. 60 (Poem of the Bells, 1913), and Poema de los mares australes, op. 88 (Poem of the Southern Seas, 1925). The first was originally composed for the piano in 1912, and was later joined by a series of eight more cycles of piano poemas, written between 1920 and 1933. After this time, Williams turned his attention mainly to the orchestra, composing in addition to the third symphonic poem six of his nine symphonies and two sets of orchestral milongas, opp. 107 and 117 . Up until 1910, Williams's nationalism had been focused on the pampas and the gauchesco literature of the 19th century, epitomised by José Hernández's epic poem Martin Fierro (1872/79). In his later works he expanded his geographical attention to encompass all parts of the country . The piano poemas systematically cover the length and breadth of Argentine geography, from the Tierra del Fuego and Antarctica in the south—in the Poema fueguino, op. 86, and Poema antártico, op. 87, both composed in 1925—to the tropical north in the last two poemas: the Poema de la selva primaveral, op. 93 (Poem of the vernal rainforest, 1933) for piano, and the orchestral Poema del Iguazú (; ). The northernmost border between Argentina and Brazil is marked partly by the Iguazu River, which drops over the edge of a plateau to form the spectacular Iguazu Falls shortly before reaching the Paraná River. These falls are the subject of Williams’s orchestral work. Form and style La garganta del diablo The Poema is in four movements: # Las selvas dialogan con las cataratas (The Forests Converse with the Falls) # Barcarola del Iguazú (Barcarole of the Iguazú) # La luna ilumina las cascadas: Nocturno (The Moon Illuminates the Falls: Nocturne) # La garganta del diablo (The Devil's Throat) (The Devil's Throat is the long and narrow chasm containing the highest and deepest of the falls.) The work belongs to Williams's late phase, in which he expanded his Franckian harmonic vocabulary with a whole range devices from French Impressionism: parallel harmonies and consecutive fifths, pedal points, successions of unresolved seconds, superimposed tonalities, and, especially, episodes featuring whole-tone scales . Reception The national movement initiated by Williams in 1890 had become the dominant trend in Argentina by the 1930s when Alberto Ginastera—who would become the leading figure of Argentine nationalism during the early part of his career—was a student at the conservatory bearing Williams's name. Despite this strong influence, Ginastera remembered that Williams's often exaggeratedly literal and localistic titles, such as \\"Icebergs Rocked by the Waves\\" or \\"Penguins Swimming\\" (the first two movements of the Poema fueguino) provoked mirth amongst his fellow students .

Australian Fighter Aces 1914–1953, pp.31–32 His younger brother, John Hampshire (1916–1990), also commanded RAAF squadrons in both the Pacific and Europe. Early life The Hampshire family had an agricultural background and Keith was born at Portsea, Port Macquarie, New South Wales,Sydney Morning Herald, \\"Family Notices\\", 19 September 1914, p12. to Gladys May Hampshire and Percy George Hampshire. The family moved to Perth, Western Australia (WA), where Percy Hampshire took up a position as State Dairy Expert and later became a cattle breeder.The Daily News (Perth), 20 December 1947, p14. Keith attended Scotch College, where he obtained a Junior Certificate. Hampshire then attended Muresk Agricultural College, worked as a wool classer and gained a pilots' licence in his spare time.Sunday Times [Perth], 5 March 1939, p4. A keen surfer and track and field athlete, Hampshire was a member of the WA team at the 1935 national surf life saving carnival in Sydney,The West Australian, 17 February 1936, p8. and during the same period was also chief instructor at Cottesloe Surf Life Saving Club. He joined the RAAF on 18 January 1937 and had the service number of \\"147\\" throughout his career. In 1939, Hampshire completed a specialist signals course in England at RAF Cranwell, as the war was breaking out. He was initially posted to signals duties in Australia. Hampshire was promoted to temporary squadron leader in 1941 and returned to flying, commanding maritime patrol squadrons: No. 6 Squadron RAAF at RAAF Richmond, and then No. 23 Squadron RAAF in Queensland. He was promoted to temporary wing commander in October 1942. War service=Pacific theatre In December 1942, Hampshire received a front-line command: No. 22 Squadron RAAF, flying Douglas Boston Mk III light bombers in New Guinea. Aviation historian Hank Nelson described Hampshire's approach to operations as \\"aggressive\\", accompanied by a concern for his squadron's facilities and morale. Hampshire worked closely in 22 Sqn with Flight Lieutenant Bill Newton and it was Hampshire who recommended Newton for the posthumous award of a Victoria Cross. (In March 1943, Newton was shot down and taken prisoner during a mission over Japanese positions near Salamaua and subject to summary execution by a Japanese officer.) 22 Sqn played a key role in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea. On the morning of 5 March 1943, to hinder Japanese air support, Hampshire led six Bostons in an attack on the major airbase at Lae. As he began the squadron's attack run, Hampshire was seriously wounded in the leg by shrapnel and suffered severe blood loss, but carried out the attack and piloted his Boston back to base. Before the wound had fully healed, Hampshire resumed combat operations. As a result of his conduct since joining 22 Sqn, he was awarded the DSO, on 27 April 1943 (see the Citation opposite). In mid-1943, the RAAF transferred Hampshire to the UK. He travelled via the United States and in New York City the US Army Pictorial Service filmed Hampshire at the Empire State Building, in conversation with former members of the US 3rd Bombardment Group – discussing their respective roles during the Battle of the Bismarck Sea. The footage appeared in the documentary feature Appointment in Tokyo (1945).Jack Hively (director), 1945, (Access: 7 June 2012.) Europe In the UK, Hampshire undertook a fighter conversion course, and in late 1943, he assumed command of No. 456 Squadron, an Article XV RAAF night fighter unit, at RAF Fairwood Common, in Wales. The squadron was converting at the time to the De Havilland Mosquito NF Mk. XVII, which carried AI Mk X on-board radar. In the words of Nelson, Hampshire proved to be a \\"demanding leader who enforced the division between the officers and non-commissioned aircrew... drove the squadron hard, and [ensured] it was well prepared for front-line duties. In March 1944, in response to Unternehmnen Steinbock (\\"Operation Ibex\\"), a German Luftwaffe intruder offensive against targets in southern England, 456 Sqn relocated to RAF Ford, in Sussex. According to aviation historian Martin W. Bowman, Hampshire and his navigator, Flt Lt Tom Condon most often flew Mosquito HK286 (squadron code \\"RX-A\\"). > The pair experienced great success in this aircraft, starting with two Ju > 88s shot down on [the night of] 27/28 February 1944 off the south-west coast > [of England].

As D-Day approached, 456 Sqn switched to intruder and ground attack sorties over occupied Europe. The squadron primarily attacked trains and other ground targets in France, while also diverting the Luftwaffe from major Allied bomber operations. Near Le Havre on D-Day + 1 (7 June 1944), 456 Sqn intercepted a formation of four-engined Heinkel He 177 heavy bombers, belonging to KG 40, each armed with two glide bombs, approaching the Allied beachheads.Martin J. Bollinger, 2010, Warriors and Wizards: The Development and Defeat of Radio- Controlled Glide Bombs of the Third Reich, Annapolis, Naval Institute Press, p152. Hampshire shot down one of the heavy bombers and 456 Sqn destroyed four in all. 456 Sqn also destroyed more than 20 V-1 flying bombs. While 456 Sqn had shot down only six enemy aircraft before Keith Hampshire assumed command, it was credited with 38 kills by the time he departed. By 1944, Hampshire's brother John was also commanding a RAAF unit in the UK, No. 461 Squadron RAAF. The parallel military careers of the brothers attracted publicity, as did their recreational interests, including participation in a surf carnival reputed to be the first held in England. At around this time, Australian official war artist William Dargie made Hampshire the subject of a portrait (later acquired by the Royal Air Force Museum).William Dargie,Group Captain Keith Hampshire DSO, DFC, MA (Cantab) (oil on canvas, 91.5 cm x 76.5 cm, 1945); (6 June 2012). Hampshire ceased combat duties in November 1944, after which he was posted to No. 300 Group, RAF Transport Command. This was part of the Allied preparations for the final stages of the war against Japan.The West Australian, 22 November 1944, p4. On 18 February 1945, Hampshire was awarded a Bar to his DSO, as a result of his service with 456 Sqn (see the citation opposite). He was discharged from the RAAF in Australia on 29 April 1946, by which time he had achieved the substantive rank of group captain. Later life Nelson said of Hampshire's post-war life, that his \\"confidence, even arrogance, in decision-making, his courage, skill, competitiveness and acceptance of the loneliness of command that had served him well in the air war did not transfer easily into business.\\" He never married. Hampshire worked for the British Aviation Insurance Group in Australia and Asia, as well as fields such as farming, oil exploration, aircraft sales and importing. During the 1960s, he attended Trinity College, Cambridge, from which he received a Bachelor of Arts (1963) and a Master of Arts in economics (1970). While visiting the United States, on or about 17 November 1982, Hampshire died from injuries following a fall from a beach cliff at Palos Verdes, California.

Topel Airport or formerly Cengiz Topel Air Base, is a Turkish Navy air station located east of İzmit in Kocaeli Province, Turkey. The airport is in joint use for military and civil. Restructured in 1976, it hosts the Turkish Naval Aviation Command with two flying units, the 301st Squadron of fixed-wing aircraft and the 351st Squadron of rotorcrafts. The facility, formerly a base of the Turkish Air Force, is named after the Air Force fighter pilot Capt. Cengiz Topel, whose F-100 Super Sabre was shot down on August 8, 1964 during Turkey's military intervention in Cyprus. He ejected safely over land, but was promptly captured after landing and lynched by members of the Cyprus National Guard. He was the first Turkish pilot ever killed in action.  History  Topel Airport was originally a Turkish Air Force facility. Following the re-establishment of the aviation branch of the Turkish Navy in 1968, the first naval helicopter pilots were trained by the Turkish Army Aviation Command's flight school at the Güvercinlik Army Air Base in Etimesgut, Ankara Province. The unit, formed in 1972 at the same base, was transferred on 19 May 1973 from Ankara to Cengiz Topel Air Base due to its location close to Gölcük Naval Base in Kocaeli Province following a protocol signed with the Turkish Air Force two weeks before. That day, Turkish Navy's first rotorcraft unit was renamed 351st Naval Helicopter Squadron. The 301st Naval Air Squadron, formed in 1971 at Etimesgut Air Base in Ankara Province as the fixed wing aviation unit of the Navy, was transferred on 4 August 1972 to Bandırma Air Base to join the 6th Air Force Wing. With its four maritime patrol aircraft and twelve anti-submarine warfare (ASW) aircraft of type S-2 Tracker, the unit was then relocated to Cengiz Topel Air Base on 14 July 1976. The base, in joint use since 1973 by the air force and the navy, was transferred to the Turkish Navy Command on 14 July 1976 following the order of the Turkish General Staff. Finally, the Naval Air Station Command was established on 4 August 1976. The base was assigned to NATO on 28 October 1981. In 1983, helipads in Istanbul and Çanakkale were put in service so that helicopters of the air station could use them also. In 2011, the airport was opened to public air traffic.

This survey technique is commonly used in health research for its ease of use and its power in measuring health. Single question Self-rated health measures the present general health and gives answer choices, typically structured like a Likert Scale. The self-rated health question may take different forms. It may be formulated as “in general, would you say that you health is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?” as the first question in the SF-36 questionnaire. It may also be formulated as “In general, how would you rate your health today,” with the possible choices being “very good” (1), “good” (2), “moderate” (3), “bad” (4) or “very bad” (5)” as used by the World Health Organization. All questions do not necessarily have five answer choices; it can be more or less. The self-rated health question is purposely vague so as to seize people’s own assessment of health according to their own definition of health. Although the answer to the self-rated health question is based on what people think—and thus is subjective—it is a statistically powerful predictor of mortality in the general population and has also been shown to predict morbidity. Methodological strengthValidity= The strong association between self-rated health and mortality is used as proof that this measurement is valid, because mortality is considered as the most objective measurement of the general health of an individual. =Reliability= The self-rated health question has been found to be a reliable measurement of general health since respondents rated the same general health assessment within a period where their health was unlikely to change. Despite the reliability of the measurement, the self-rated health question “in general, would you say that you health is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?” is particularly vague. Thus, this measurement has low level in reliability test than other self-rated measurements that assess a more specific aspect of health. Questionnaires Self-rated health, as measured by a questionnaire, attempts to measure health in all its dimensions. In such a questionnaire, participants answer a series of questions which are typically structured using a Likert Scale. The SF-36 questionnaire is an example of tool for self-assessed overall health. The SF-36 questionnaire addresses several dimensions of physical and mental health. Uses of self-rated health Considering that self-reported health is a powerful predictor of mortality and considering its easy application, this subjective measure of health is often used in health research and large-scale surveys. This measure helps follow the evolution of health across time and between populations.

Recent research, however, raises the question whether he ever really existed. He is said to have been born circa 1580 in County Antrim and to have died circa 1653 at Eglinton Castle. Background All current knowledge about O'Cahan is based on anecdotes by the harper Arthur O'Neill, retold by Edward Bunting (1840), Charlotte Milligan Fox (1911), and Francis O'Neill (1913). Captain Francis O'Neill explained the uncertainty concerning his lifetime, stating he lived c.1570 to 1650 and that he was active during the first half of the 17th century. According to Arthur O'Neill, unlike the vast number of travelling musicians, O'Cahan was a gentleman by birth, his sept being hereditary allies of the O'Neill dynasty. Their territory was Keenaght (barony), now part of County Londonderry in Northern Ireland. Reflecting his origins, O'Cahan \\"traveled into Scotland attended by the retinue of a gentle man of large property, and when in Scotland, according to the accounts preserved there also, he seemed to have traveled in the company of noble persons.\\"Francis O'Neill: Irish Minstrels and Musicians: With Numerous Dissertations on Related Subjects (Chicago: Regan, 1913; reprinted Cork: Mercier Press, 1987), p. 60. Compositions O'Cahan's best-known composition is Give Me Your Hand (Irish: Tabhair dom do Lámh, Latin: Da mihi manum), published originally under its Latin title.http://www.earlygaelicharp.info/tunes/damihimanum/; retrieved 1 May 2020. There is an anecdote about its composition: > \\"Proud and spirited, he resented anything in the nature of trespass on his > dignity. Among his visits to the houses of Scottish nobility, he is said to > have called at Eglinton Castle, Ayrshire. Knowing he was a harper, but being > unaware of his rank, Lady Eglinton commanded him to play a tune. Taking > offence at her peremptory manner, O'Cahan refused and left the castle. When > she found out who her guest was her ladyship sought and effected a speedy > reconciliation. This incident furnished a theme for one of the harper's best > compositions. Tabhair Damh do Lámh (or Give Me Your Hand). The name has been > Latinized into Da Mihi Manum. The fame of the composition and the occasion > which gave birth to it reaching the ear of King James the Sixth, induced him > to send for the composer. O'Cahan accordingly attended at the Scottish court > and created a sensation.\\" > \\"His performance so delighted the royal circle that King James I familiarly > laid his royal hand on the harper's shoulder. When asked by one of the > courtiers if he realized the honour thus conferred on him, to their > consternation Rory replied: 'A greater than King James has laid his hand on > my shoulder'. Who was that man?' cried the King. 'O'Neill, Sire', proudly > answered Rory standing up.\\" In the late 20th century, the piece was wedded to Raggle Taggle Gypsy in a version by Planxty and has since enjoyed a huge resurgence. Other compositions Bruce Armstrong attributed the following pieces to O'Cahan: * Lude's Supper * The Terror of Death * The Fiddler's Content * Rorie Dall's Sister's Lament * The Derry Air O'Neill thought that Port Athol, Port Gordon, and Port Lennox, were all O'Cahan's. Seabhac Bheal Atha Seanaigh/The Hawk of Ballyshannon, celebrating the wedding of Charles O'Donnell, son of Manus of Rosturk Mulranny, County Mayo, to a Miss More, composed to a tune by Rory Dall O'Cahan is printed in Bunting (1840, p. 13).Edward Bunting: The Ancient Music of Ireland (Dublin: Hodges and Smith, 1840; reprinted Dublin: Walton's, 1969). Death O'Neill reports that he died in Scotland: > \\"It is a curious coincidence that after spending many years with McLeod, of > Dunvegan, in the Isle of Skye, O'Cahan should die at Eglinton Castle about > the year 1653. In some inaccountable way during his long sojourn in Scotland > he became known as Rory Dall Morrison, and this has so clouded his origin > and identity as to involve his very nationality in question.\\" O'Neill was, > however, mistaken as their lives didn't even overlap, Morrison being born on > the Isle of Lewis around 1656 while O'Cahan was born in Antrim in the 1580s. > Rory Dall Morrison is buried in Dunvegan on the Isle of Skye while O'Cahan > is buried in Sleat, also on Skye, having spent most of his life in the > Scottish Highlands. Maybe this is what confused O'Neill. Doubts about O'Cahan's existence In 2017, the Scottish researcher Keith Sanger explained at length his reasons for believing that Rory Dall O'Cahan never existed and was instead made up by Arthur O'Neill. He takes up the most thorough biographical research on O'Cahan to date, which was first published by Colm Ó Baoill in 1971 and repeated in 2007.See Bibliography. Ó Baoill stated that \\"while Arthur cannot be contradicted on present knowledge, the known history of the O Cathain family does not support his account in any way\\"Colm Ó Baoill: \\"Some Irish Harpers in Scotland\\" (1971–72), p. 145; see Bibliography. By 2007, Ó Baoill wrote, \\"the argument is based on no real evidence, and until some is found we must conclude that the only relic we have of Ruairi Dall Ó Catháin is his music”. Sanger, having revisited the sources for the music (the \\"Straloch manuscript\\" of about 1627–1629) states that this has gone missing in 1845. He concludes \\"But overall the evidence, or rather the lack of any, for a Rorie Dall O'Cathain does not provide much of a base on which to build his character.\\"Keith Sanger: \\"Mapping the Clarsach in Scotland\\", published 31 May 2017 on wirestrungharp.com, pp. 16–18; retrieved 1 May 2020.

The megalithic tomb with Sprockhoff No. 508 was built between 3500 and 2800 B. C. in the New Stone Age as a megalithic site of the Funnelbeaker culture (TBK). According to Ingrid Schmidt, \\"Neolithic monuments are an expression of the culture and ideology of New Stone Age communities. Their creation and function are features of social development\\". J. Müller In: Varia neolithica VI 2009 p. 15  Construction  The burial chamber has two side walls each formed from three large supporting stones. On these supporting uprights there were originally two capstones, only one of which has survived. On surviving capstone, 27 shallow depressions, so-called cup marks (German: Schälchen for \\"little bowls\\") may be seen. The burial chamber, which is oriented in an east-west direction, was originally completely covered by an earth mound and only accessible via a narrow passage at one end. The passage, which points to the southwest, is made of red sandstone slabs. The opposite end of the chamber to the entrance is formed by a single large stone. At comparable burial sites there is often a trapezoidal frame of individual standing stones surrounding the whole site, known as a Hünenbett. This is missing at Goldbusch, although there may have been one initially. The chamber was probably originally buried under an earth mound covered in turn with boulders.  History  The grave site was constructed in the New Stone Age by the agricultural peoples of the Funnelbeaker culture and used for several centuries. The dead would have been laid out for extended periods outdoors. The bones were laid down together with the grave goods in the chamber. In the local area around the Goldbusch tomb was a large number of similar sites. On the Hagenow Map of 1829, forty three megalithic tombs are shown within and area little more than two kilometres long between Altensien and Seedorf. Of these, only the Goldbusch site, which is close to the shore of Lake Sellin has partly survived.  Results of the excavation  In 1969, an excavation of the Goldbusch tomb was carried out, led by Ewald Schuldt. The burial chamber was, at that time, already badly damaged. It was found that the supporting stones of the chamber were not sunk into the ground, but just rested on the surface and were fixed with stone wedges and clay, indicating a late construction, since the uprights of the early tombs were sunk deep into the ground. The capstone had slipped down into the grave chamber. Only remnants of the original grave goods were found. As well as flint arrowheads, six axes of the same material, a gouge, various shards of pottery and two decorated pottery jars were found.

Immigration to France from the United States date back to the 19th century and according to the American embassy in Paris, as of 2015, there are about 150,000 to 200,000 American citizens residing in France. History=19th Century Unofficial figures indicate that up to 50,000 free blacks emigrated to Paris from Louisiana in the decades after Napoleon sold the territory to the United States in 1803. Paris was the art capital of the world in the nineteenth century and has attracted painters, sculptors, and architects from around the world including the United States.\\"Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History - Americans in Paris, 1860–1900\\", The Metropolitan Museum of Art In the decades following the American Civil War, hundreds of Americans joined the throngs headed to Paris. American artists, who formed the largest contingent of foreign painters and sculptors in Paris, were only one segment of the capital's extensive American colony, which also included writers, businessmen, diplomats, and others in more-or-less permanent residence. Many American artists stayed together, and enclaves of them developed on the Left Bank, along the rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs and near the École des Beaux-Arts and the Académie Julian's headquarters. Although some lived in Paris for long periods—even the rest of their lives—most insisted on identifying themselves as American. 20th to 21st CenturyWorld War I and the Aftermath= Officers of the American Expeditionary Forces and the Baker mission During the United States campaigns in World War I the American Expeditionary Forces fought in France alongside British and French allied forces in the last year of the war, against Imperial German forces. The first 14,000 U.S. infantry troops landed in France at the port of Saint Nazaire and by May 1918 over one million U.S. troops were stationed in France, half of them being on the front lines.Pershing, My Experiences in the World War (1931) In the aftermath of World War I, when about 200,000 were brought over to fight, Paris began to have an African-American community. Ninety per cent of these soldiers were from the American South. France was viewed by many African Americans as a welcome change after incidents of racism in the United States. Beginning in the 1920s, U.S. intellectuals, painters, writers, and tourists were drawn to French art, literature, philosophy, theatre, cinema, fashion, wines, and cuisine. It was during this time that jazz was introduced to the French and black culture was born in Paris. =American expatriates in Paris, 1918–1940= With the defeat and dismantling of Austria at the end of World War I, Paris replaced Vienna as the cultural capital of Europe, if not of the world. Many foreigners settled in Paris during this period, some briefly and some long-term, some exiles and some voluntary, because of Paris's tolerance for unorthodox sexuality, politics, and art. The movement built on itself, as the more intellectuals and artists moved to Paris, the more attraction it had for others. Among the Americans living in Paris during this period are Paul Bowles, Aaron Copland, Ernest Hemingway, Henry Miller, Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, and Alice B. Toklas. =World War II= When France officially declared war on Germany in September 1939, as a response to the Third Reich's invasion of Poland, an estimated 30,000 Americans lived in or near Paris.\\"Americans in Wartime Paris\\", Bonjour Paris Although that declaration was followed by roughly nine-months of what often was called the \\"phony war\\" or \\"drôle de guerre,\\" the inevitability of coming conflict led most of those expatriates to leave France while they could. In June 1940, the inevitable occurred with massive German attacks and after scarcely three weeks of battle, Nazi troops marched uncontested through the gates of Paris and some 5,000 Americans still were in the French capital. For various reasons, such as family ties and professional obligations, they had chosen to remain in Paris. At that moment, the United States was not at war, however, and not militarily allied with anyone. It was still a neutral nation. German occupying forces were legally obligated to treat U.S. citizens better than French nationals even though many were bi-nationals with French passports as well as American ones. Americans who stayed in the capital endured most of the shortages and hardships of their French neighbors but to some extent for nearly a year and a half they were not imprisoned by German occupying authorities. However, their lives were not easy and often tragic, in particular for African-Americans and Jewish Americans who were frequently singled out by the Nazis for harsher than normal treatment. Because the United States still remained neutral, the German occupying forces at first allowed long-standing institutions in the French capital such as the American hospital, the American library, the American church, the American Chamber of Commerce as well as various others of a commercial or charitable nature to remain open. When the United States entered the war, it led to a clamp down on U.S. citizens in German-occupied northern France. Many were rounded up and sent to internment camps. Those who were not still were obligated to report regularly to German occupying authorities or French police. Internments applied initially only to men although, in September, 1942, German authorities began to intern American women as well. =Aftermath of the War to Present Day= Many American students have been flocking to France for further education following the aftermath of the Second World War. In 2007-2008, more than 17,000 Americans studied in France as undergraduate and graduate students, a number which represented a 46 percent increase since 2001.\\"Study in France - Why France? \\", Campus France For majority of Americans, France is the country that first comes to mind when retiring abroad. Among the reasons were the scenery and the climate as well as France being a cultural leader of the world.\\"Paris Unraveled\\", Study Abroad Guide, January 2011 Religion The American Church in Paris is the first American church established outside the United States. It started in 1814, when American Protestants started worshipping together in different homes around Paris.

The battle took place in August 1237, pitting the forces of the Crown of Aragon, under the command o Bernat Guillem I d'Entença, against the forces of the Taifa of Valencia, under the command of Zayyan ibn Mardanish. The battle resulted in a decisive Aragonese victory and the conquest of Valencia by the crown of Aragon.  Context  The Almohades had successfully integrated the Emirates of the Iberian Peninsula together with those in North Africa into a somewhat unstable political entity. The Almohad governors of Balansiya, Zayd Abu Abd Allah Muhammad and Zayd Abu Zayd were able to act with complete autonomy, including giving titles of kingship. They never exercised this right by coined money or renouncing their fealty to the Almohad Caliphate or to its emperor. After the Almohad defeat at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa, the empire disintegrated and fractured in smaller kingdoms called taifas. The most important of these were the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada or Emirate of Granada, the Hafsid Taifa of Tunisia, the Banu Zian Taifa of Algeria, and Marinid controlled Morocco. In 1224, James I of Aragon called on his nobles from Aragon and Catalonia to initiate the conquest of Muslim controlled Balansiya, entering the area through Teruel. Zayd Abu Zayd promptly asked the Aragonese monarch for a truce which he accepted in return for one fifth of the income from Balansiya and Mursiyya. During the summer of 1225, James I attempted to take the castle at Peñíscola by laying siege to it. That siege was ultimately unsuccessful as the Aragonese nobles abandoned it. By 1228, an indigenous Valencian-Muslim rebellion led by Ibn Hud, gained enough support to take the city of Madina Mursiyya and to dominate the regions of Orihuela, Dénia, Gandia, Xàtiva, and Al-Yazirat Suquar. The rebellion further laid siege to Balensiya itself, albeit unsuccessfully due to the menace of a relief force from the Kingdom of Castile. Ibn Hud retired to Madina Mursiyya without taking Balensiya. The pact between the Christian king and Abū Zayd caused many Muslims to switch their allegiance in favor of Zayyan ibn Mardanish, the grandson of Abu al-Hajjaj, thinking that Abū Zayd had betrayed them and abandoned Islam. Abū Zayd fled Valencia and headed north while Zayyan triumphantly entered the city in the winter of 1229 without proclaiming himself king. From Madina Mursiyya, the anit-Almohad rebel, Ibn Hud, laid siege to Valencia, pressuring Zayyan into abandoning the city. James I of Aragon, who had recently conquered Majorca in 1229, decided to try once again to conquer the Taifa of Valencia.  The Campaign for Valencia  In 1235, the Crown of Aragon was conducting attacks in the area around Balansiya at Albalat and Cullera, but the Christian army was forced to retire. On 25 June 1235, James I of Aragon laid siege to the castle at Foios on the outskirts of Balansiya. The Muslims fighting for Zayyan ibn Mardanish, who were forced to retire to the south, destroyed the fortifications at El Puig. James I met with the dethroned Emir Abū Zayd in Teruel to establish a new pact between them. Instead of his signature, the document was stamped with Abū Zayd's crest, an eagle and the Castilian motto: Sciello de Ceit Buceit nieto de [Emir al] Momenin. The date was set at 28 May 1236 and it stipulated that a fourth of the territory of Valencia would go to Abū Zayd upon the conquest and that Abū Zayd and his descendants would declare themselves the vassals of James I and of any children he had with Violant of Hungary. It was at this time that Abu Zayd had converted to Christianity and adopted the name Vicens Bellvis. He married a woman from Zaragoza named María Ferrandia. Some sources incorrectly cite one \\"Dominga López\\". In the documents from 1236, the Catalan and Aragonese forces are already preparing for their eventual attack on Balensiya. On 13 October 1236, the cohorts of Monzón attempted the conquest. On a document dated to 28 October issued in Lérida, James I proclaimed that once the city of Valencia was conquered, he would donate to its church, saying: \\"apud Montesonum in curia generali quam convocavimus pro facienda exercitus contra mauros\\". The same day he promised to turn the city's central mosque into a Catholic church. On 13 November, James I issued a decree stating that once the city was taken, the church of Valencia would become a dependent of the See of Tarragona. In further preparation for Valencian life after the conquest, James I decreed that the provincial master for the Order of the Temple would have the power to mint coinage in its territories.  The Campaign in Palancia  After the Siege of Burriana and the Siege of Cullera, James I of Aragon positioned himself for the final push into the Province of Valencia. He gathered his forces at Monzón on 28 October 1236 where he gained approval from Pope Gregory IX to name the conquest an official Crusade by order of Papal Bull on 2 February 1237. After encamping in Montpellier from the end of 1236 through the beginnings of 1237, the army concentrated on Teruel and followed the Palancia River, taking La Vall d'Uixó, Nules, and Almenara.LA Enciclopedia, Almenara They further took the towns of Bétera, Paterna, Moncada, and finally El Puig on 25 June 1237 which was situated close to the city of Balensiya. The Aragonese forces rebuilt the fortifications of El Puig, building a wall of mud and stone that stretched all the way to the sea. After two months, the defensive works were ready and the castle was occupied by a garrison of 100 knights and many more peasants commanded by Bernat Guillem I d'Entença, a relative of the king. According to the Muslim historian Ibn Khaldun, from 16 September to 4 September 1236, the Christians had attacked the Saracens, building seven encampments, two of which were concentrated against Balansiya, Al-Yazirat Suquar, and Xàtiva. While Castilian forces took the city of Córdoba under the command of the Castilian king, James I took power over the majority of the Castilians in his area of operations. After building a castle at Enesa to facilitate his besieging of Balansiya, he returned home. Chronological map of the conquest of Valencia. The battle Zayyan ibn Mardanish mustered the people of Xàtiva and the Júcar and advanced towards El Puig. According to the chronicles of James I, his force numbered around 600 cavalry units and 11,000 peasants or foot soldiers. He attacked the Aragonese forces on 15 August 1237. According to the Muslim historian Ahmed Mohammed al-Maqqari, the attack occurred shortly after James I had left El Puig for Huesca. Ibn al-Abbar, who had been Abū Zayd's secretary when he presided over Valencia, became Zayyan's scribe after Aby Zayd left the city. He recorded the battle as having happened around noon. The Muslim Almohad forces under Zayyan were routed, and a great many of their soldiers were slain in the action. Amongst the Almohad dead was the preacher Aburrebii ibn Salim Elcolaí \\"the wise\\". When news reached James I of Aragon of the victory, he traveled to the site of the battle, where he remained a few days, after which time he returned to Aragon. This decisive Aragonese victory had a great influence over the overall fight for the control of Balensiya. After the battle, the number of Christian forces in the region swelled, forcing many Muslims to flee south.  Consequences  Whilst James I of Aragon was in Aragon, the commander of the Aragonese army at El Puig, Bernat Guillem I d'Entença, died of wounds received during the action. This greatly disheartened the nobles, especially those of Aragon. At the council of magnates, Blasco I of Alagonia, speaking on behalf of many other barons, voiced that it would be better to evacuate El Puig and temporarily abandon the gains made during that portion of the campaign. James I refused to follow the advice of the nobles and proceeded to continue the campaign. The king again returned to El Puig de Santa Maria on 24 January 1238, bringing with him the son of Bernat Guillem d'Entença, Guillem d'Entença who was about 10 to 11 years of age at the time. In front of all the nobles present and the representatives of the military orders, the king knighted Guillem and pronounced him the heir to all the titles and lands of his father. He further provisionally appointed Berenguer de Entenza as a captain of the castle. The gestures made by the king did little to halt the opposition to the continuation of the campaign. On the contrary, once knowing that the king was en route, a large portion of the garrison at Puig met secretly and agreed to abandon their position. One of the Dominican friars who resided in the garrison denounced the plot against the king. The following day, he gave a sermon to the nobles of the castle who there after promised to continue the fight until victory. Once back at the Puig, James I received a message from Zayyan offering all the castles from the Turia River to Tortosa and Teruel, the construction of a lavish palace for the king in Saïda Province and the payment of ten thousand besantes annually in return for James' promise to abandon his attack of the capital. James I of Aragon responded negatively to the offer, citing the changed circumstances, and proceeded with his conquest.

The mission of Grupo Folklórico Los Mejicas is to conserve the traditional Mejicas style; to teach the Mexican culture and historical aspects of the nation through art and interpretation in their dance. The Mejicas use history and art to bring together students and community members.\\"http://www2.ucsc.edu/mejicas/history.html\\"  History  Grupo Folklórico Los Mejicas is one of the oldest student organizations on the UC Santa Cruz campus. It was initiated at Merrill College in 1972 by a small group of students who taught each other dances.\\"http://www2.ucsc.edu/mejicas\\" Since then, the group has grown and branched out. To this day, Los Mejicas has over 60 active members. Los Mejicas has been dedicated to the preservation and continuation of Mexican folkloric culture. Here, both students and community members learn a variety of dances and repertoires that change every year. The group is self-taught by elected student members and also learns dances from the occasional guest-instructor. Instructors include Maestros from neighboring groups, student members who have learned dances at different dance conferences, and instructors who have previously been in the group. Los Mejicas is committed to group retention and preservation, and serves as more than just a dance group and student organization; it provides a safe space and is a community of peers bound together by the love of dance, and of Mexican culture.  Baile Folklórico  Baile Folklórico is a form of traditional dance in many Latin American countries. Though its physical presence in Latin America is prevalent, its presence in literature and research is very limited. However, Mexican Folklórico is one of dances that has had some research. Olga Najera-Ramirez, a notable Anthropologist professor at UC Santa Cruz, is a key contributor to the literature of Mexican Folklórico dance. Professor Nájera- Ramírez teaches courses on folklore theory, expressive culture, dance, cultural performances, and Greater Mexico.\\"http://anthro.ucsc.edu/faculty/singleton.php?&singleton;=true&cruz;_id=olga\\" She also wrote, directed, and produced two bilingual documentaries; the most recent being Danza Folklórica Escénica: El Sello Artístico de Rafael Zamarripa (Mexican Folkloric Dance: Rafael Zamarripa’s Artistic Trademark), which tells the story of this vibrant art form through the life and work of the internationally acclaimed artist and choreographer, Rafael Zamarripa. In her undergraduate career at UCSC, Najera-Ramirez was also a committed member of Los Mejicas and currently acts as their faculty advisor.  Cultural Representation  Folklórico groups like Los Mejicas act as a public symbol for Mexican culture.\\"Olga Nájera Ramírez, Social and Political Dimensions of Folklorico Dance: The Binational Dialectic of Residual and Emergent Culture Western Folklore, Vol. 48, No. 1 (Jan., 1989), pp. 15-32.JSTOR\\" The performance and dance of folkloric dance display the richness of the Mexican heritage.\\"http://losmejicas.wordpress.com/regions/\\" Each dance performed by Los Mejicas consists of representing different regions in Mexico and historical periods of Mexican culture through dance. There are over 21 regions in Mexico that have their own cultural traditions and performances of Baile Folklórico.\\"Stanley L. Robe Contemporary Trends in Folklore Research Latin American Research Review, Vol. 2, No. 2 (Spring, 1967), pp. 26-54.JSTOR\\" Los Mejicas have performed regions such as: Chihuahua, San Luis Potosi, Guerrero, Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Sinaloa, Jalisco, Nayarit Costa, Colima, Durango, Puebla, Tabasco, Veracruz, Sonora Bronco, Yucatán, Baja Norte, Aguascalientes, Chiapas, and many more from past years. Mexican folkloric dance was used to represent a cultural symbol of national unity in post revolutionary Mexico. Mexican folkloric dance is unique to the Mexican culture by representing dances that originated in the indigenous areas of Mexico. Mexican folk dancing varies from region to region. In Guadalajara, the Jarabe Tapatia, or Mexican hat dance, is popular. The Jarabe is a courting dance and also the national dance of Mexico. In Guerrero, many folk dances mimic animal movements-the Iguana is a popular dance. The national sense of unity of folkloric dance is thus a result of each region's distinct performance. Cultural Significance The mission of Los Mejicas is derived from the folkloric reasoning of promoting the Mexican heritage. The Mejicas wish to celebrate and preserve the beauty of Mexican heritage and culture through dance. Their well known slogan, \\"Once a Mejica, Always a Mejica\\", acts not only as motto, but also as a statement of a sense of identity and as a sense of belonging. It is a tagline that holds both literal and symbolic meaning, one that represents more than the simple association of having once participated in the group; it indicates something deeper, an acknowledgement of where one has come from, and the promise to take that knowledge into the future.\\"http://www.gtweekly.com/index.php/santa-cruz- arts-entertainment-lifestyles/santa-cruz-arts-entertainment-/3875-viva-los- mejicas.html\\" A UCSC student and Mejica, Edgar Ontiveros, says as he was growing up in Tijuana, Mexico he was always surrounded by folklórico: “It was just something that I took for granted, but when I came here to university and I realized that I was kind of far away from home, I started getting in touch with folklórico as a way to feel connected with Mexico,” he says. And the group continues to be an avenue that connects that culture with campus life. “The group provides a space where you can feel welcome at this university,” he says. For Latino students and non-Latino students alike, Los Mejicas provides the opportunity to connect to and learn more about Mexican culture.  Costumes  Traditional folkloric costume varies across each Mexican region. The attire in the Federal District of Mexico reflects the traditional Spanish influence while the Yucatán region reflects indigenous traditions.\\"The JVC/Smithsonian Folkways video anthology of music and dance of the Americas: Volume 6 Central and South America. Dir. and Prod. Ohta, Horoaki, Katsumori Ichikawa, Yuji Ichihashi and Nihon Bikuta Kabushiki Kaisha. Videocassette. Multicultural Media, 1995.\\" Northern Mexico folkloric costumes also have their unique style—the costumes from the Jalisco region in Mexico have women wear brightly colored ruffled skirts that are trimmed with ribbons and ornate hair pieces. The region of Veracruz instead has women wear beautiful white dresses that are full of lace. The coastal region of Mexico, specifically Sinaloa, has women wear lighter and more colorful dresses. Generally, male dancers wear black slacks; a black, wide brimmed hat (sombrero); and a red belt and tie. The Mejicas incorporate the different styles each Mexican region represents in their costume attire for performances. Based on what region the members of Los Mejicas will perform, they create their own choreography. Each costume is unique and is used in different ways depending on the region.  Membership  Los Mejicas comprises both students of the University of California, Santa Cruz and Santa Cruz community members. It has a set of Core Members who are voted in by Mejicas members at the end of each academic year. Core consists of two co-directors, two costume directors, an events coordinator, a finance coordinator and a historian. Los Mejicas accept dancers of all levels of experience. Los Mejicas functions as a student organization and club, but also functions as a class where students can enroll through the Latin American and Latino Studies or through the Anthropology department for class credit and fulfillment of an arts general education requirement. It is open to students of all cultural and ethnic backgrounds.\\"http://losmejicas.wordpress.com/about-2/ \\"  Events  Los Mejicas performs at a myriad of cultural events on campus at UC Santa Cruz, but also off campus in the Santa Cruz community. Events include things such as Spanish Camp, ORALE “Brought to you by MECHA”, Danzantes Unidos Festival “Carnaval de Muertitos\\", Womyn of Color Conference 2011 “Celebrating Our Stories: Breaking Traditional Constraints and Striving for Empowerment”, UCSC Day by the Bay Celebration, Cinco de Mayo Celebration at Santa Cruz High School, Cinco de Mayo Celebration at Soledad Prison, Relay For Life 2011, Multi-cultural Festival “MCF\\", Baile Folklórico Stanford Annual Concierto de la Primavera at Stanford University and finally at the end of the year spring show celebrating their 40th anniversary: Mejicas, hoy y siempre – Mejicas, now and forever.

As descendants of Timur, they are also members of the Timurid Dynasty, and therefore were connected to other royal families in the Mediterranean, Middle East, and Far East. So, the Mughal Empire has descended from the two most powerful dynasties. Babur was also directly descended from Genghis Khan through his son Chagatai Khan.

History  In his 1906 book American Character, author Brander Matthews mentions the idea of a \\"league of nations\\" and a \\"planetary consciousness\\", believing it would be created by American politicians in the coming centuries. Key planetary consciousness events of the 20th century include the creation of the League of Nations, the signing of Kellogg-Briand Pact, the creation of the United Nations, and the creation of the Bretton Woods system. Democratic globalization advocate Abhay Kumar points to the International Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) board of directors election in 2000, which were conducted globally, as the first example of global democracy. In September 2001, Ervin László and the Dalai Lama wrote an essay titled \\"Manifesto on Planetary Consciousness\\", which was adopted at a meeting at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in Budapest. Its introduction begins: Andreas Bummel, CEO of the Committee for a Democratic UN, says, \\"The first step into the direction of a world parliament would be the establishment of a Parliamentary Assembly at the United Nations\\". Concept Advocacy for the idea of planetary consciousness is based on the technological advancements made by the mankind in the fields of transport and telecommunications during the 20th century and in the first decade of the 21st century. Kumar claims that these technological advancements have turned the whole planet into an interdependent economic, political and communication community. He specifically cites the invention of the Internet and the mobile phones as key technological achievements of the 20th century which brought humans into more continuous interconnected communication. He believes that these inventions will lead to a second Renaissance and global democracy, just as the Gutenberg press in 1439 led to the first Renaissance, the Age of Enlightenment, and Nation states. Bummel describes planetary consciousness as integral, insofar as it does not conflict with other levels of social identity, but instead is a holistic perspective on humanity and the planet as a whole. Steven Kull writes that while nation states are reluctant to work cooperatively, individuals seem more willing. Author Shashi Tharoor argues that an Earth Anthem sung by people across the world can inspire planetary consciousness and global citizenship among people.Indian diplomat pens anthem for earth The New Indian Express 5 June 2013 See also * Earth Anthem * Global citizenship  References  Consciousness Society Global politics Political movements Globalism Global citizenship ","title":"Planetary consciousness"},{"id":"36055391","text":"Barrow Raiders are an English rugby league club who have had numerous notable players throughout their history.

Friedman and Eric Maskin from back cover of the book \\"Oligopoly pricing\\" He is currently Chaired Professor of Regulation, Competition and Public Policies, and academic director of the Public-Private Sector Research Center at IESE Business School in Barcelona. Biography A native of Barcelona, after obtaining his bachelor's degree from the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB), received a doctorate from UC Berkeley under the supervision of Gérard Debreu, and moved to the University of Pennsylvania as an Assistant Professor. In 1987 moved back to Spain and headed for ten years the Institute for Economic Analysis (CSIC) in the decade of the 1990s. In 2001 he moved to the business school INSEAD in Paris and in 2005 went back to Barcelona with a research professorship at ICREA-UPF (Pompeu Fabra University). He also taught at UAB and held visiting positions at Harvard University, the University of California at Berkeley and New York University. He served as Director of the Industrial Organization Program of the Center for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) in 1991-1997. He was editor of the International Journal of Industrial Organization in 1993-1997, editor-in-chief of the European Economic Review (1998–2002) and of the Journal of the European Economic Association (2003–2008). Currently he is editor of the Journal of Economic Theory and co-editor of the Journal of Economics & Management Strategy. Since 2014 he is member of the Identification Committee of the European Research Council. He has participated extensively in the policy debate in Europe with contributions to a substantial number of reports published by CEPR and CESifo networks as well as columns in The Financial Times, The Wall Street Journal and the Spanish press. From 2011 to 2014 he was Special Advisor to the Vice President of the European Commission and Commissioner for Competition, J. Almunia. Research contributions Vives' research concentrates on microeconomics and ranges from industrial organization, information economics, and game theory to banking and finance. Specifically, his most recent contributions have been related to topics such as dynamic rivalry, innovation and competition, and competition policy among others.IESE Business School. “Xavier Vives  Economics & Financial Management.” IESE, www.iese.edu/faculty-research/faculty/xavier-vives/. His contributions started with seminal research in oligopoly theory and the study of price and quantity competition providing canonical models and results on price formation and competitiveness.“Price and Quantity Competition in a Differentiated Duopoly” (with N. Singh), The RAND Journal of Economics, 15, 4, 1984, 546-554.“On the Efficiency of Bertrand and Cournot Equilibria with Product Differentiation”, Journal of Economic Theory, 36, 1, June 1985, 166-175.“On the Strategic Choice of Spatial Price Policy” (with J.F. Thisse), American Economic Review, 78, 1, March 1988, 122-137. The research extended to the interaction between private information and strategic behavior with the early study of information sharing among firms.“Duopoly Information Equilibrium: Cournot and Bertrand”, Journal of Economic Theory, 34, 1, October 1984, 71-94.“Information Sharing Among Firms”, in The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics, New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2008 This research has served as a basis for extensive theoretical and applied developments in industrial organization and international trade among other fields, as well as having implications for competition policy. A path breaking contribution was the pioneer application of lattice-theoretic methods to analyze games of strategic complementarities (or supermodular games), and in general complementarities, in economics.“Nash Equilibrium with Strategic Complementarities”, Journal of Mathematical Economics, 19, 3, 1990, 305-321.“Complementarities and Games: New Developments“, Journal of Economic Literature, 43, 2, 2005, 437-479.“Supermodularity and Supermodular Games”, en Game Theory, S.

Van Zandt), Journal of Economic Theory, 134, 2007, 339-360. His contribution opened the gates to numerous applications in a wide range of fields including macroeconomics and finance. Further work has studied incomplete information economies and the mechanisms of information aggregation and transmission in markets and learning by traders formalizing the ideas of Hayek. This work provides a bridge between the rational expectations and the herding literatures.“Aggregation of Information in Large Cournot Markets”, Econometrica, 56, 4, July 1988, 851-876. \\"How Fast Do Rational Agents Learn?\\", Rev.

Little is known about his life, though through his son Sultan Abu Sa'id Mirza, he was the great-grandfather of Babur, founder of the Mughal Empire of India. Life Muhammad Mirza was the sixth son of Miran Shah, himself the third son of Timur. According to Abu'l Fazl, the Grand Vizier of his descendant Akbar, Muhammad Mirza's mother was Mihr Nush of the Fulad Qiya tribe. Orientalist Henry Beveridge states that, while he does not know of this tribe, the fact that Muhammad Mirza is described as always living with his brother Khalil Sultan suggests that the two were likely full-siblings. This would imply that 'Mihr Nush' was an alternate name for Khalil Sultan's mother Khanzada Begum, the daughter of Aq Sufi Qunqirat of Khwarezm and granddaughter of Jani Beg, Khan of the Golden Horde. Muhammad Mirza was at some point appointed governor of Samarqand and married Shah Islam, daughter of Suhrab Kurd. She was a relative of Izz al-din Shir, the Kurdish ruler of Hakkâri and a former adversary of Timur. By this marriage he had two sons: Manuchihr Mirza (d. 1468) and Abu Sa'id Mirza. Death The date of Muhammad Mirza's death is not recorded. The Zafarnama does not include his name among the thirty-six sons and grandsons of Timur who were alive as of 807 Hijri (1404 – 1405). This, along with the fact that he was not mentioned by Clavijo during his 1404 visit to Timur's court, led Henry Beveridge to theorise that Muhammad Mirza had by this point already died, predeceasing his father and grandfather. However, this contradicts that he was living with Khalil Sultan in 1410, during the reign of their uncle Shah Rukh. During his fatal illness, Muhammad Mirza was visited by his cousin Ulugh Beg, with whom he had shared a close relationship. The dying prince entrusted to Ulugh Beg the guardianship of his son Abu Sa'id Mirza, who was then raised under his care.

O'Brien played all over the north of England, in taverns, picnics, and fairs. He was especially fond of Yorkshire and Lancashire, but was known to wander as far south as Devon. Captain Francis O'Neill tells of him: \\"While sauntering along a highway one day he came to a fine-looking mansion, and, being thirsty, he went up to the hall door and rang the bell. An old lady, whose head was crowned with a wealth of snow-white hair, responded. When O’Brien announced the object of his call she asked him where he came from.\\" > \\"On learning that he was an Irishman she further inquired if he knew a place > called Ballinamuck. Of course he did, for it was close to his birthplace. > Then the mystery of her interest in Irish topography was revealed.\\" > \\"Her son, an officer in the English army, was killed in that vicinity a > little while before the battle of Ballinamuck, in September, 1798. When the > Irish and French troops were marching towards the town, followed closely by > the English.\\" > \\"A French soldier dropped out of the ranks, too ill to proceed farther, and > crawled behind a stone wall to die. Seeing the English force marching by a > short time later, he took deliberate aim at an officer and shot him dead. > The victim was the whitewhaired lady’s son.\\" > \\"Notwithstanding a bereaved mother’s cherished grief, O’Brien’s thirst was > assuaged with a beverage stronger than water.\\" He relocated to the United States in the early 1860s, disembarking at Portland, Maine and proceeding from there to all Irish communities in the state before going on to Boston, Massachusetts. In 1875, he settled in Chicago, staying at the home of Roger Walsh (formerly of Portland). Here he made the acquaintance of Captain Francis O'Neill, who in 1913 wrote \\"Many a pleasant hour the present writer spent listening to “Jimmy’s” delightful music and memorizing his tunes, many of which were not in circulation until given publicity through our efforts.\\" After his death in 1885, his pipes were held by John Doyle, and after his passing, to Sergeant James Early.

Biography  Bernat Guillem d’Entença was born in 1226. Bernat was a member of the House of Entença. He was the son of Bernat Guillem de Montpeller, also known as Bernat Guillem I d'Entença, and Jusiana d'Entença who were the respective uncle and aunt of James I the Conqueror. His father, Bernat Guillem de Montpeller, participated in the Conquest of Majorca and Valencia during the Reconquista, and died after the Battle of the Puig in 1238. Bernat Guillem d'Entença, who was 10 or 11 years old, inherited his possessions and was also called to war. Due to his young age, his relatives Berenguer d'Entença and Gombau d'Entença fought in the name of House of Entença instead of him during the rest of the campaign. After the defeat of the moors in Valencia, the House of Entença achieved important territorial gains. He would marry Alamanda de Sant Martí in 1242, the daughter of an important noble family of New Catalonia, offering her as dowry the towns of Castellnou and Rafals. This increased the social status of his house and reinforced his presence in Valencia. Between 1250 and 1260 he assisted the Kingdom of Castille with their fight against the moors and he also delimited the border between the Kingdom of Castille and the Crown of Aragon. In 1264 he tried to claim the territory of Montpellier but failed. He participated in the Conquest of the Kingdom of Murcia from 1265 to 1266 and, in 1273, he protected the border established by the Treaty of Almizra from the Kingdom of Castille. In 1284 he fought in the Siege of Albarracín (1284). He would also participate in the peace treaty between Alfonso II the Chaste and the King Castille in 1289.

Efforts to strengthen diplomatic relations between the two countries was hindered by mutual distrust between the two countries, with the Philippines being a key ally of the United States, the Soviet Union's main rival in the Cold War. Anti-communist sentiment among many Filipinos was also an obstacle.Asiaweek, 10 August 1986  Overview  Since 1967, the Philippines became more active in improving ties with the Eastern Bloc countries. Even as the Philippines began softening ties with the Soviet Union and its allies, the Philippines remained cautious and suspicious toward the Soviet Union approaching the union with a \\"backward-forward\\" style of diplomacy. The Philippines has been wary to the Soviet Union due to ideological differences and past links to underground movements.Thambipillai, Pushpa, and Daniel Mutuszewski ed. The Soviet Union and the Asia-Pacific Region: Views from the Region. New York: Praeger Publishers, 1989. The Soviet Union, also showed mistrust towards the Philippines due to its strong ties with the United States. Any development that would lead towards the eroding of the ties between the Philippines and the United States would be welcomed by the union, but the Soviet Union itself admitted that those developments would be limited.  History  It took 20 years after the formation of the Soviet Union would the Philippines consider to establish ties with the former. Salvador P. Lopez proposed a review of relations with the Soviet Union and its allies, reduce dependence on the United States and an Asian policy that would take account China's emergence as a power of Asia. The administration of Diosdado Macapagal rejected the proposals.Salvador Lopez, New Directions in Philippine Foreign Policy (Quezon City:U.P. Law Center 1975), 18. It was during the presidency of Filipino president Ferdinand Marcos, that the relations between the Philippines and the Soviet Union reached its peak. In a Foreign Policy statement released in January 1967, Marcos acknowledged the need to pursue more vigorously for establishment of Philippine ties with the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.Manila Times, 25 January 1967, 22A Also in the same month, Foreign Affairs secretary Narciso Ramos spoke of possible relaxation on the ban against trading with socialist states.Benjamin Domingo, The Making of Filipino Foreign Policy (Manila, Foreign Service Institute, 1983), 224. As part of Marcos' foreign policy, the Philippines sent missions to the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, East Germany and Bulgaria. Formal diplomatic relations between the two countries was established on June 2, 1976.  Economic ties  The Soviet Union composed of 1–2 percent of the Philippines total trade. The two states granted each other most favored nation status on custom duties, internal taxes and the issuance of import and export taxes.Brillante, 135-140 The most exported products of the Philippines were food products, manufactured goods and alcohol products such as beer, rum and gin while the Soviet Union exported industrial equipment, minerals, tools, machinery, coal and oil to the Philippines. During the 1972–1984 period the Philippines recorded a favorable balance of trade with the Soviet Union but in 1985 onwards the Philippines exports of traditional products to the Soviet Union were insufficient. A feasibility study was conducted in 1982 as part of a joint venture of the Philippines and the Soviet Union for the construction of a 1 million ton per year cement plant that would significantly add to the current annual output level of 4 to 4.5 million tons enabling the Philippines to export cement. The project was discontinued due to financial constraint. It would have been the first Soviet industrial project in the Philippines.  Factors affecting bilateral relations  The Philippines has long been plagued by poverty and agrarian issues which caused the rise of communist and secessionist movements in the country. The Philippines is a Catholic majority nation which is an important factor because the Catholic Church is against Communism which associates it to atheism, violence and dictatorship. Filipinos were also hostile to atheists, and up until 1986 atheism was a crime worth 10 years in jail. The United States and Japan's economic aid to Southeast Asian nations, complicates relations. The Red Scare and the intensified insurgency made the Filipinos suspicious towards the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union remained distrustful of the Philippines due to its ties with the United States, with the Philippines assisting the United States in both the Korean War and the Vietnam War which the Soviet Union was involved to.  Alleged Soviet sponsored terrorism Reports of the New People's Army and radical labour groups being sponsored by the Soviet Union circulated.Manila Bulletin, 11, 15–16 July 1987. The Philippine Senate urged an investigation of Soviet aid to labour groups and insurgents, and the sighting of submarines allegedly belonging to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Ambassador to Manila, Vadim Shabalin denied Soviet involvement and such allegations were \\"flagrantly distorting\\" to the Soviet Union's foreign policy towards the Philippines.

Background Olmius was the only son of John Olmius, of Braintree, Essex, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, and his wife Elizabeth Clarke, daughter and heiress of Thomas Clarke, a London merchant. He was the grandson of a wealthy Dutch merchant who had settled in England. He acquired New Hall near Boreham, Essex, in 1737.

He was returned as MP for Colchester instead at the 1741 British general election but was unseated on petition on 26 February 1742. He was a supporter of Walpole and later Newcastle and Pelham.

Abu Zayd, who had converted to Christianity, fled the city and became a vassal of the Aragonese king, James I.

Zayyan personally commanded troops various battles throughout the campaign, including the Siege of Burriana and the Battle of the Puig, where the Muslim troops were decisively defeated, marking the inevitability of the Aragonese take over. After the Battle of the Puig, Zayyan defended the city of Valencia until it fell in 1238. The Muslim hand was forced into surrender due to a lack of aid that was expected from the Sultan of Tunisia.

Such methods include formal languages, formal grammars and first-order logical expressions. Formal linguistics also forms the basis of computational linguistics. Approaches=Semiotic Methods of formal linguistics were introduced by semioticians such as Charles Peirce and Louis Hjelmslev. Building on the work of David Hilbert and Rudolf Carnap, Hjelmslev proposed the use of formal grammars to analyse, generate and explain language in his 1943 book Prolegomena to a Theory of Language. In this view, language is regarded as arising from a mathematical relationship between meaning and form. The formal description of language was further developed by linguists including J. R. Firth and Simon Dik, giving rise to modern grammatical frameworks such as systemic functional linguistics and functional discourse grammar. Computational methods have been developed by the framework functional generative description among others. Dependency grammar, created by French structuralist Lucien Tesnière, has been used widely in natural language processing. Psychological Analytical models based on semantics and discourse pragmatics were rejected by the Bloomfieldian school of linguistics whose derivatives place the object into the verb phrase, following from Wilhelm Wundts Völkerpsychologie. Formalisms based on this convention were constructed in the 1950s by Zellig Harris and Charles Hockett. These gave rise to modern generative grammar. It has been suggested that dependency relations are caused by a random mutation in the human genome. Generative models of formal linguistics, such as Head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG), have been widely studied and used in natural language processing.

The battle pitted the Umayyad forces of the Emirate of Cordoba under Abi-Abda against the troops of the Kingdom of Leon under Ordoño II of León. The battle resulted in a Leonese victory.  Context  In 912, Ordoño II ordered the repoblación of San Esteban de Gormaz as the city had been one of the borderline cities in between the Moorish and Christian zones of the Iberian Peninsula. This region had become depopulated early in the Muslim takeover and acted as a buffer zone between the two groups. The battle Upon hearing of Ordoño II's efforts to repopulate and take control of the city, Abi-Abda ordered a siege of the city in 917. Ordoño II was able to successfully come to the city's aid and routed the Muslim forces. Abi-Abda himself was captured during the fray and executed by decapitation. His head was put on display on the city's ramparts as a warning to the Muslims.  Aftermath  A similar battle would take place in 919 where the Muslims were repulsed, however by 920 the city was again in Muslim hands. The city would change hands multiple times until 1054 when the town was permanently retaken by the Christian forces under the command of Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar, also known as el Cid.

He directed many television programs for the BBC in the 1960s and 1970s, and also worked as manager for musical artists including David Bowie and Tom Jones. He was one of the pioneers of cut editing and rapid perspective changes in BBC television programming, and was a major force behind the creation of Israeli television in the 1970s. Professional career=Early career Upon reaching 18 years old during the closing years of World War II, Barry Langford was called for service in the British Army. His family had a long history as professional entertainers (including musicians, whistlers, and stuntmen) and this saw his talents being channeled into the Entertainment National Service Association ENSA Entertainments National Service Association, providing entertainment to the British Army during his period of service. Barry's father, Louis Langford (originally surname was Lelyveld, his family being natives of the Netherlands) had run the family silver business during the war years. After the war, Louis retired, putting the collection in the London Silver Vaults Barry took over the family silver business after his father's retirement. He entered a small, niche industry, with only 3–4 dealers present at the vaults at the time, mostly trading with other dealers. Barry opted to take the silver business in a new direction. His enormous flair for publicity and concerted efforts to market the Chancellery Lane silver vaults to Americans paid off, with the business becoming highly successful as it became more retail-oriented. Success saw the business moving to Charles Street, the new shop proving a good business headquarters for the Langford silver business. Celebrities such as Elizabeth Taylor, Liberace, and Ava Gardner were drawn to and became customers of the Langford silver business. Over time, Barry's talents for publicity and entertainment saw him beginning to produce shows at Brighton Theatre. He also was featured as one of five citizens of London in the documentary Citizen 63 directed by John Boorman. His activities eventually caught the attention of entertainment mogul Lew Grade. The two eventually met, with Barry and Lew sharing similar tastes in entertainment style and direction. Lew guided Barry and set him on his course as a TV director, recognizing in Barry a natural talent for publicity and style. British television and music industry With the guidance of Lew Grade and his innate stylistic talents, Barry became a highly successful and innovative television program director despite having no previous professional experience. He directed \\"The Beat Room\\", a highly popular British pop program as well as other successful British pop shows, including the Juke Box Jury, \\"Dad, you're a square\\", \\"Exit, It's The Way Out\\", \\"Gadzooks, It's All Happening\\", and the Tom Jones BBC TV series. While producing in the music industry, he discovered David Bowie and helped launch Tom Jones' career, managing them both for a time. He also managed the American singer P.J. Proby. Barry Langford was involved in the discovery of the Who, featuring them on the Beat Room and other programs he produced or directed. Later in his career, he acted in or did screenwriting for various Israeli-made films. Personal life Langford was born 7 February 1926 in London, England. He is the older brother of Lawrence Langford, who created one of the world's largest collections of marine antiques and model ships. He was married to Shirley Irene Hale (born Hersheson)Shirley Irene Hale with whom he had two children, Jeremy and . He was a first-class bridge player, having played professional for Australian teams as well as becoming one of Israel's top players. He died on 25 July 2012 in Israel. Childhood Growing up in the UK, Langford lived a happy childhood with his younger brother Lawrence. Barry had shown an interest and knowledge of music even at an early age. His passion for music would one day guide him towards becoming involved in the music industry. The Langford family moved repeatedly during Barry's childhood, his father Louis moving the family as he traveled from business to business. Louis avoided telling other people the Langford family was Jewish, in light of antisemitic stereotypes of the time. Barry's education suffered as a result of switching school several times, his grades being poorly affected by this. This caused classmates to underestimate his keen intelligence, which manifested itself well in social situations. Largely self-educated, Barry adapted to the many changes in his early life quickly, a valuable skill that would service him well in later life. Adult life Before his directing and producing career began, while still working in the Langford family silver business, Langford met Shirley Hale, the daughter of another silver dealer. The two, having many similarities, soon married. After leaving the silver business, the family traveled together, moving back and forth twice between Australia and the United Kingdom in 1965, 1967, and 1969, before finally moving and settling in Israel in 1972. At the age of 45, Langford and his family settled in Israel. Becoming involved in the Israeli television and music industry, he lived and worked in Israel until retiring. Later in life, he and Shirley Hale divorced. Political activism After being released from military service after World War II, Barry Langford became one of the early members of the 43 group, along with Vidal Sassoon. The 43 Group was originally composed of 43 young British Jewish ex-servicemen who opposed the political organization and activities of Oswald Mosley & the Union Movement, Jeffrey Hamm's British League of Ex-Servicemen, and other British fascist organizations. Activities ranged from protests, breaking up far-right meetings, infiltrating different fascist parties and groups, to street fighting.

Long live Hindustan) is a Hindustani phrase and battle cry most commonly used in India in speeches and communications pertaining to or referring to patriotism towards India. It translates to \\"Long Live India\\". It is a nationalistic slogan, and has been used in nationalist protests such as radical peasant movements in post-colonial India. Other variations of the slogan are Jai Hind and India Zindabad. Such slogans are common while cheering the Indian team in cricket matches.  Etymology  The word Hindustan generally refers to the Republic of India since 1947. It is conventionally believed to be derived from the Old Persian word Hindu, which in turn is derived from Sindhu, the Sanskrit name for the Indus River. Old Persian refers to the people living beyond the Indus as Hinduš. This combined with the Avestan suffix -stān (cognate to Sanskrit \\"sthān\\", both meaning \\"place\\") results in Hindustan, as the land on the other side (from Persia) of the Indus. Zindabad (may [idea, person, country] live forever) is a typical Urdu and Persian suffix that is placed after a person or a country name. It is used to express victory, patriotism or as a prayer.  Use in episodes of violence  The slogan Hindustan Zindabad, and its counterpart, Pakistan Zindabad, were used during the partition of India in episodes of sexual violence against women: the slogans were often tattooed on the bodies of victims of collective rapes.  In popular culture  The slogan became popularized in recent times as it was used in the film Gadar: Ek Prem Katha, where the protagonist, Tara Singh (Sunny Deol), is asked to shout Hindustan Murdhabad (death to India) in Pakistan as a condition to receiving approval from his father-in-law for the marriage of his wife, but he defiantly proclaims Hindustan Zindabad instead and then uproots a hand pump and kills a few attacking locals belonging to a mob angered from his remarks. In real life, Deol, as a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party, had used the same dialogue and slogan in a speech in a rally prior to Indian independence day in 2019.https://www.republicworld.com/india-news/general-news/sunny-deol-chants- hindustan-zindabad-in-a-patriotic-speech-in-nagpur-gets-fervent-response-from- crowd.html  See also  *Jai Hind *Indian Nationalism *Inquilab Zindabad *Vive, Viva *Bangladesh Zindabad *Pakistan Zindabad  References  Battle cries Nationalism in India Indian political slogans Urdu words and phrases Indian independence movement Political catchphrases Hindi words and phrases Bengali words and phrases ","title":"Hindustan Zindabad"},{"id":"36056318","text":"Welford Road railway station was a railway station built by the London and North Western Railway to allow their staff to collect passenger tickets from LNWR trains entering Leicester from the south.
