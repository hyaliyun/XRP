She was famous in contemporary Europe for her beauty and adventurous life. During the Russo- Turkish War (1787–1792) she was the lover of the Russian commander prince Grigory Potemkin and acted as an agent in Russian service.Simon Sebag Montefiore (2006). Potemkin och Katarina den stora – en kejserliga förbindelse (Potemkin: Catherine the Great's Imperial Partner) (in Swedish). prisma. . Compatriots of her time wrote: \\"She was beautiful as a dream, a child of southern countries. All those who have seen her admire her beauty, igniting a fire in the hearts of men and envy in the eyes of women.\\" Life =Early life= Potocka was born in 1760 January 1 (11 January, New Style) in the Turkish city of Bursa to Constantine Clavone, a poor Greek cattle merchant, and Maria Clavone. In 1772, when Zofia was 12 years old, she moved to the Greek district of Phanar in Constantinople with her parents and sisters. Around 1775, when Zofia was 15 years old, her father Constantine died under mysterious circumstances. Her mother married an Armenian, who also died. During the great fire in Constantinople, their house burned down. In this difficult time for them, her mother Maria sought support from foreign embassies. In May 1777, when Zofia was not yet 17 years old, Maria sold her two daughters to the Polish Ambassador, Karol Boscamp-Lasopolski. The ambassador was known to procure girls for the Polish king. Learning about their supposed noble origin and seeing the beauty of the girls, the Ambassador agreed to help. The sister were claimed to descent from the noble aristocratic family of Pantalis Mavrocordatos, who was related by blood to the rulers of Byzantium. Zofia and her sister settled in his palace and was given lessons in French. Reportedly, the ambassador kept her as his mistress for a time, and then prostituted her. Boscamp-Lasopolski arranged for her sister to be sold as a wife to a Turkish Pasha, but he promised her mother to arrange marriage for Zofia in Europe. The Polish Count Major Józef Witt learned the purpose of the trip and her ancient lineage. He made an offer, bought her from Boscamp- Lasopolski and married her in 1779. Józef Witt was the son of the commandant of the fortress Kamianets, and the couple lived a year in Kamianets-Podilskyi, before departing for Europe in 1781. =Europe= Zofia reportedly made a sensational success when being introduced to the aristocracy by her spouse in the drawing room receptions of Europe in the palaces of Berlin and Hamburg, Vienna, Rome, Venice and, most famously, in Paris. She was celebrated as \\"The most beautiful woman in Europe\\" and known for her expression: \\"My eyes aches\\". Her beauty and admired ability to improvise herself out of difficult situations resulted in an admiration and love affairs with several of the most powerful personalities of Europe at the time, which attracted a lot of attention. She was regarded as fashionable decoration at every party in high society in the cities they visited and was courted by monarchs and ministers. At the beginning of their European tour, the couple visited Warsaw. In early March 1781, she was called to court to be introduced to King Stanisław II Augustus. After Warsaw, they visited Berlin, where Zofia was introduced to the King of Prussia Frederick II. In the resort town of Spa, Zofia was introduced to the Austrian Emperor Joseph II, who was reportedly so fascinated and impressed by her that he ordered Mozart to compose music on the Turkish harem theme. In one of his letters to his sister, the French queen Marie Antoinette, Joseph II recommended the Witte couple to her. Zofia saw Marie Antoinette at Petit Trianon, which at that time was being rebuilt in a landscaped park. This was possibly what Zofia was inspired to create a similar park. Reportedly, Marie Antoinette was charmed by her and spoke of her as her adopted daughter. During her stay in Paris, Zofia became the lover of both of the French king's brothers; the Count of Provence, later King Louis XVIII, and the Comte d'Artois, the future French king Charles X respectively. On 17 November 1781 Zofia gave birth in Paris to a son. When this news reached the Polish king, she personally visited Kamianets and congratulated her father-in-law Josef Witt with the birth of a grandson, promoted him to the rank of Lieutenant General and volunteered to be the godfather of the newborn. =Russia= In 1782, the couple returned to Kamianets visiting Vienna, Moravia, Northern Hungary and Galicia on the way. In 1785, her spouse Joseph Witte succeeded his father as commandant of Kamianets-Podilskyi, making Zofia first lady of Podolia. During the Russo-Turkish War (1787–92), she entered a relationship with the Russian Prince Potemkin, the commander of Catherine the Great, which lasted until his death. At least during the Siege of Khotyn, her spouse managed Potemkin's net of agents in Southern Poland and his spy contacts within Chotin: in practice, however, these contacts were likely managed by, or at least with the assistance of Zofia, whose elder sister was married to the Turkish pasha of Chotin. Potemkin appointed her spouse governor of Cherson, and gave Zofia the informal task of managing the Turkish-Polish relations. In 1791, she accompanied Potemkin to Saint Petersburg, where she was introduced to the nobility as his official mistress. =Later life= In February 1796, Zofia arrived in Uman and announced her divorce from Jozef De Witte. On 17 April 1798, in Tulchyn, she remarried Stanisław Szczęsny Potocki, who had divorced his wife in order to marry her. The wedding ceremony was conducted with the participation of the Orthodox priest and Catholic priest in an Orthodox Church. During her second marriage, Zofia had three sons; Alexander (born in 1798), Mieczyslaw (born in 1800) and Boleslaw (born in 1805), and two daughters; Sophia, and Olga (1802-1861). During the marriage, she also had an affair with her stepson, Szczęsny Jerzy Potocki, who may have been the biological father of her son Boleslaw. She also had an affair with the Russian governor, Nikolai Novosiltsov. Stanisław Szczęsny Potocki indulged in mysticism and came under the influence of Polish \\"Illuminati\\" and died on 15 March 1805, without having time to say goodbye to her. As a widow, she was by law only entitled to her dowry and a small portion of the fortune of her late spouse, which would have had a bad effect on her economy as she had brought no dowry to the marriage; however, she managed to inherit almost all of the fortune of her late spouse with the assistance of her stepson and the Russian governor, both of whom were her lovers. As a widow, Zofia reportedly occupied herself with the upbringing of her children and charitable activities. Looking back on her time in Russia, she described Potemkin as a brother. =Death= In the early 1820s, she experienced a deteriorated health. Reportedly, the mysticism of the Polish Illuminati was suspected to have affected her health. She left for Berlin to consult German doctors, where she died. She left instructions to be buried Uman. Zofia's embalmed body was clothed in a beautiful dress and placed in a carriage, in one hand a bouquet and in the other a fan. Her body was transported in such a way across the border. In Uman, an elaborate funeral ceremony was conducted out of respect pfor the charity of her last years. When the Zofia's coffin was carried 10 miles along the road, barrels of resin were placed for lighting torches, lighting the way as the procession passed the night before a huge crowd. Zofia was buried in the crypt under the Basilian church. In 1877, the body was disturbed as the church was badly damaged by an earthquake. Zofia's remains were reburied in Talne with those of her youngest daughter Olga, where they still rest in the crypt of the church. Zofia Potocka died in on 24 November 1822, aged 62.

He was an early lithographer in Malacca, Macao, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong, possibly the first Chinese to master the craft. Name Wat's name was ,. which is now romanized as . in pinyin. \\"Wat Ngong\\" is one way of writing the Cantonese pronunciation of the same characters. It is also variously romanized as , ,. or ', , ,. or ; as . or \\"A-gong\\";. and as or . Life Wat was born in 1785. The missionaries later reported that his life before meeting them had been \\"improvident\\", having abandoned his wife and child \\"entirely\\" and wandering without any regular employment. He apparently visited England \\"several times\\" before 1816. Wylie records that he was \\"connected with the London Mission as a printer, almost from its first establishment\\", but he passes unmentioned in Robert Morrison's journals of his early years in Macao and Guangzhou (then romanized as \\"Canton\\"). Morrison, the first Protestant missionary in the Qing Empire, undertook translation and adaption of the 1714 Kangxi Dictionary alongside his translation of the Bible into Chinese. Through his comprador Yong Sam-tak, he either hired trained printers or trained his hired servants to cut the wooden type and operate the presses needed. He also asked his employees to attend Sunday services and daily meetings at his home... Wat was noted by the Chinese Recorder as having received his initial Christian instruction not from Morrison but from William Milne,. which would have occurred after he had (illegally) left Guangdong for Malacca around 1815. In Malacca, he worked for Milne at the Anglo-Chinese College along with Liang Fa, who instructed him in the art of printing and successfully converted him to belief in Christianity. As Liang's assistant, he helped print Morrison and Milne's Bible. His son Ahe also worked as a typesetter for Morrison's dictionary. He was baptized by Morrison on Macao on 21 February 1830. In addition to his studies with Milne and Liang, he had received additional instruction from Morrison in the months leading up to this.. Following his baptism, he reconciled with his family despite the difficulty occasioned by his wife's devotion to \\"idols\\". He endured persecution for his faith, association with foreigners, and travels abroad. The same year, he accompanied Liang on a roughly journey to distribute Christian literature through the interior of Guangdong southwest of Guangzhou. They distributed about 7,000 tracts—some hundreds of pages long—which they had written and printed themselves. They joined the entourage of one of the imperial examiners and passed from prefecture to prefecture, proselytizing among the scholars who assembled for the tests. In 1831, Wat was engaged by the London Missionary Society as a Native Assistant and, in 1833, he is noted as having regularly attended Morrison's daily meetings. There are unclear references to some long- standing dispute between Wat and Liang that was eventually resolved; they worked together in Malacca and again to continue the mission with another native worker after Morrison's death in 1834.. In the early 1830s,. Morrison's son John trained Wat to use the mission's recently imported Albion press and in the art of lithography, which reduced the effort, time, and expense of printing. From this, Wat has been called the first Chinese to master the craft,. although his work is often overlooked by Chinese scholars. He busied himself with printing at Macao, distributing his works among his family and acquaintances and explaining their content. He ran Medhurst's printshop in Guangzhou after 1832, Morrison probably having removed the lithographic machine there from Macao. He used it to print \\"scripture sheets, tracts, &c.;\\" Britain's 1833 Government of India Act ended the East India Company's legal monopoly on the Canton trade. Amid the diplomatic crisis occasioned by the uptick in opium smuggling and Lord Napier's resort to force to assert his right to act as the British consul in Guangzhou, the Emperor personally expressed disbelief that westerners were responsible for the Chinese-language magazines and broadsides being distributed by the British. Qing subjects were forbidden to teach to the language, and a crackdown was ordered. In 1835, a warrant was issued for Wat's arrest after it was made known to the authorities that he was printing for the British. He had advance warning and fled to the English ships at Lintin Island, whence he returned to Malacca in 1836. His son Ahe was tricked into leaving Morrison's house and arrested in the street; as the boy proved a ready informant, he was kept a long time but treated well.. While in Malacca, Liang and Wat caused a \\"spike\\" in conversions, netting more than thirty converts in a span of months. When many of these new converts later abandoned the faith, it prompted disputes within the LMS about the meaning and requirements for baptism. When James Legge moved from Malacca to Hong Kong in 1843 to supervise the establishment of its new theological seminary, Wat accompanied him, along with He Futang and He Yasan.. Wat worked with Legge at the Medical Missionary Hospital on Morrison Hill.. Liang Fa also joined them.. In 1853, during the early stages of the Taipings' victories in central China, Legge sent Wat and Wu Wenxiu to Shanghai to negotiate with them for the entrance of Protestant missionaries to occupied Nanjing. After six months in the city, the two men considered the embassy a failure and returned to Hong Kong. Wat died in 1867. Works In addition to the works by Morrison, Milne, Liang, and others that Wat assisted with editing and printing, he was directly responsible for various Chinese-language tracts.

He may have compiled the preface, but it was his grandson, the historian Khvānd-Amīr (1475–1534), who continued the main portion of this volume and to whom also a part of the appendix must be ascribed. =Manuscripts, editions and translations= There are various different Persian manuscripts in Iran, Vienna, Paris, and London.

The site has seven moai, all of equal shape and size, and is also known as a celestial observatory that was set up around the 16th century. The site is located inland, rather than along the coast. Moai statues were considered by the early people of Rapa Nui as their ancestors or Tupuna that were believed to be the reincarnation of important kings or leaders of their clans. The Moais were erected to protect and bring prosperity to their clan and village. A particular feature of the seven identical moai statues is that they exactly face sunset during the Spring Equinox and have their backs to the sunrise during the Autumn Equinox. Such an astronomically precise feature is seen only at this location on the island. Geography Ahu Akivi, aligned in an east–west direction, is located on the flank of the southern slope of Maunga Terevaka at Rapauni and it is surrounded by fairly flat agricultural land. It is inland in the non coastal zone and is at an elevation of . Ahu Vai Teka is at a distance of from Ahu Kavi which is considered as part of the Ahu Akivi- Ahu Kavi complex. From Hanga Roa, an inland road leads to the site via the volcanic cone of Terevaka ( peak level). The coast road is via Playa Anakena. On this road there are many moai statues lying scattered and un restored. There are paths branching off to Puna Pau, which is a quarry of low volcanic crater with red coloured rocks known as scoria, which has been used to carve 70 of the \\"top hat\\" of the statues known as pukao which could be cylindrical top knot of hair or grass hat or turban. Further on, the site of Ahu Akivi is reached. The site is located to the Northeast of Hanga Roa, the capital city of Easter Island, about to its north. The Rano Raraku quarry from where the statues were made is at least away and free access is through the land route held by the clans. History Ahu Akivi is part of the Ahu Akivi-Vai Teka complex which was built up by the Rapa Nui people in two phases. In the first phase, during the 16th century a central rectangular platform was created on a leveled surface. It had wings projecting to the north and the south directions. An approach ramp was also part of this platform which led to the ceremonial plaza stretching towards the west of the central platform. A cremation ground existed behind the central platform. The second phase of construction was elaborately planned and implemented in the early years of the 17th century when the platform was modified, a ramp was created, seven statues of equal size were erected. Another crematorium was also built. A cave in which people used to reside was also used as tomb during historic times. The other Ahu in the complex is the Ahu Vai Teka, which is a much smaller platform of length made up of rough lava stone blocks. There is no statue now, though one is believed to have existed initially. Both the ahus were believed to have been aligned astronomically with respect to the Sun. Both are located in the territory of the Miru, the highest ranking clan and the western confederacy, and both were contemporary. It is also conjectured that the seven statues were placed at Ahu Akivi at least 150 years before the first Europeans found the island when the clan was functional at that time. It is also evident that their culture existed for 250–300 years with economic prosperity with political stability. In 1955, Thor Heyerdahl recruited American archaeologist William Mulloy and his Chilean associate, Gonzalo Figueroa García-Huidobro, who restored the statues to their original position; they had found them in knocked down condition in 1960. Mulloy's work on the Akivi-Vaiteka Complex was supported by the Fulbright Foundation and by grants from the University of Wyoming, the University of Chile and the International Fund for Monuments. Ahu Akivi also gives its name to one of the seven regions of Rapa Nui National Park. Legend The statues on the island invariably faced the village as a protective mana, but in the case of the Ahu Akivi statues they face towards the sea. There is a legend narrated for this positioning of the seven statues. It is conjectured that the Rapanui people did it to propitiate the sea to help the navigators. However, according to an oral tradition, Hotu Matu’s priest had a dream in which the King's soul flew across the ocean when the Rapa Nui island was seen by him. He then sent scouts navigating across the sea to locate the island and to find people to settle there. Seven of these scouts stayed back on the island waiting for the king to arrive. These seven are represented by the seven stone statues erected in their honour. Features Closer view of Ahu Akivi statues The architectural features of an Ahu platform were discerned by archaeologists, depending on its length under five categories. These are: A central platform of varying length; platform made of crude masonry in its rear wall or with fine masonry in the rear wall; with or without wings; with one or more statues; a red scoria top knot (headgear), ramp, a crematoriums plaza pavement, crafted front retaining wall, a cornice made of red scoria. In the case of the Ahu Akivi all these features have been noted except that the rear part of the platform is made of crude masonry wall. Another feature of the foundation of the platform is that the stones used to make it are not from the island but were brought as ballast in the 19th century in a ship. Apart from the above, archeologists also unearthed stone disks, small statues, and fish hooks made of stones and bones indicative of burial ceremonies that were performed at the site. The seven moai statues are located with absolute astronomical precision. Thus, the sacred observatory and sanctuary with all the seven moai look exactly towards the point where the sun sets during the equinox and which also aligns with the Moon. Each one is of height and weighs about 18 tons, and its length is . During the excavations done here, the archaeologists also found tree root moulds, indicative of vegetative cover in the past. Restoration In 1960, when the American archaeologist and his associate carried out restoration, it took them one month to rise and fix the first moai in place. They used a stone ramp and two wooden levers to carry out this operation. However, they took less than a week to raise the seventh one.

She first became known as an 11-time winner on the Professional Women's Bowling Association (PWBA) Tour, which included the first of her six U.S. Women's Open titles in 1996, before that organization suspended operations in 2003. Since the rebirth of the PWBA in 2015, Johnson has won ten more PWBA Tour titles, including five more majors, for a total of 21 PWBA titles. She won six additional professional titles during the PWBA Tour's hiatus, becoming a member of the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) and the PBA Women's Series. Johnson was elected to the United States Bowling Congress Hall of Fame in December 2014, and was officially inducted on April 29, 2015. On November 18, 2017, Johnson became the second female bowler (after Kelly Kulick who won the 2010 PBA Tournament of Champions) to win an event on the national PBA Tour, the third woman to defeat a man in a televised championship bowling match (the first was Lynda Barnes at the 2008 Clash of Champions, an event not hosted by the PBA Tour) and the first to win a non-major (standard) PBA Tour title. Johnson is currently a pro staff member for Storm Bowling, Turbo Grips, High 5 gear and Master bowling products. Personal life Born in Cheektowaga, New York, Johnson was a standout youth softball player, playing the sport from age eight through her high school graduation at Niagara- Wheatfield High School in Sanborn, New York. Primarily a pitcher, she won 60 games during her high school years. Shortly after high school, she won the 1992 Coca-Cola Youth Bowling Championships in the Girls' Scratch division. Johnson then bowled at Morehead State University, earning both Rookie of the Year and Collegiate Bowler of the Year honors in 1993, but stayed in college only one year, as she was determined to make bowling her career. She claims that bowling is the only job she's ever had. She worked in her local bowling center early on, and has held various pro shop and pro staff positions in addition to earning a living on the lanes. In 2018, she married her girlfriend Kasia Kaufman. She currently resides in Palatine, Illinois. PWBA career (1995–2003) Johnson qualified for Team USA and joined the PWBA Tour shortly after leaving college. On the pro circuit, she started strong, capturing Rookie of the Year honors and a major tour victory at the U.S. Women's Open in 1996. She won a second PWBA major at the 2001 Hammer PWBA Players Championship. Another PWBA career highlight came in 2001, shortly after the terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C. In an emotional event held on September 14 — the first professional sporting event to resume after the attacks — Johnson bowled the third televised perfect 300 game in PWBA history to defeat Carolyn Dorin-Ballard in the final match of the Paula Carter Classic. Competing in the PBA Not to be denied the opportunity to bowl in professional competition, Johnson became a member of the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) — generally regarded as the \\"men's tour\\" — in 2004. Early in the 2004–05 season, she made history by becoming the first woman to qualify for a standard PBA tour event, making the Round of 64 at the 2004 Uniroyal Tire Classic. Later that season, she raised the bar even higher by becoming the first woman to make the televised finals of a PBA event (2005 Banquet Open). In this event, she also became the first woman to ever defeat a man in a PBA Tour broadcast, winning her semifinal match over Wes Malott by a score of 235–228. She was unable to complete the quest for a title, falling 219–192 to eventual PBA Player of the Year Tommy Jones in the final match. Johnson posted another \\"first\\" in the summer of 2005 — becoming the first woman to win a PBA event, as she captured the title in a PBA Regional Tour stop (2005 East Region Kingpin Lanes Open). To win that tournament, she had to defeat four- time PBA titlist Ryan Shafer in the semifinal, and PBA tour veteran Mike Fagan in the finals. On November 18, 2017, Johnson won the PBA Chameleon Championship at the 2017 World Series of Bowling in Reno, Nevada, her first win on the national PBA Tour and the second victory ever recorded by a female on the Tour. Kelly Kulick was the first woman to accomplish this feat, at the 2010 PBA Tournament of Champions. She also is the third woman to defeat a man in a televised bowling championship match. Lynda Barnes was the first woman to do so by defeating Sean Rash in the 2008 USBC Clash of Champions, but this event was not part of the PBA Tour. Kulick became the second woman to defeat a man on a televised title bowling match, but the first to do so in a PBA Tour event. Johnson became the first woman to win an open, non-major PBA Tour title. Major Wins and PBA Women's Series (2004–14) Johnson won the 2007 U.S. Women's Open over close friend and tour roommate Shannon O'Keefe at the National Bowling Stadium in Reno, Nevada. The event returned in 2007 from a three-year hiatus when its rights were acquired by the United States Bowling Congress (USBC). Liz also won the 2007 PBA Ladies and Legends tournament (with partner Roger Kossert), which was part of that season's PBA Senior Tour. Johnson's first PBA Women's Series title came in the Don and Paula Carter Mixed Doubles event, where she partnered with Norm Duke for the victory on January 6, 2009. In the Baker Doubles format, Johnson threw five of the ten frames in the final match, and had a strike in every frame.\\"Johnson, Duke Nearly Perfect in Winning PBA Mixed Doubles Title\\", pba.com, February 1, 2009.

It was Johnson's second USBC Queens title and sixth career major championship. Johnson continued her dominance in 2015, winning her fourth U.S. Women's Open on September 6, 2015. As in her 2007 U.S. Women's Open win, Johnson defeated Shannon O'Keefe in the final match to take the $50,000 top prize. Johnson became one of only two women to have won the U.S. Women's Open at least four times (with Marion Ladewig being the other). She is also the first player to successfully defend a U.S. Women's Open title since Dottie Fothergill in 1968–69. Liz was named PWBA Player of the Year for 2015. At the December 2015 World Women's Championship (WWC) in Abu Dhabi, Johnson bowled 300 as the anchor bowler in the team event finals, as Team USA won the Gold Medal in the WWC team(-of-five) competition.

She made the televised finals in all four majors, and tied Player of the Year runner-up Kelly Kulick by cashing in 13 tournaments. =2018 season= Johnson won her 20th PWBA title on July 29, 2018 at the Storm PBA/PWBA Striking Against Breast Cancer Mixed Doubles championship. She teamed with PBA professional E. J. Tackett in this annual event held in Houston, Texas. Johnson received praise from her partner for her bold move to play the extreme outside angle on one lane and an inside line on the other. Said Tackett: \\"There was not a single person in this building who could have done what she did in that last game. It was absolutely amazing watching her play outside on one lane, inside on the other. There are only two people in the world who can do what Liz did – her and Norm Duke. That's one reason she is the greatest woman bowler of all-time.\\" Johnson won her 21st PWBA title and second of the 2018 season on August 18 at the PWBA Columbus Open. =2019 season= On January 6, 2019, Johnson won the World Bowling Tour Women's Finals, a non-title event in which the finalists are based on performance in global events throughout the previous season. This was Johnson's first ever win in the event, having made the finals five previous times without winning. Style Johnson's bowling style is considered to be mechanically sound and consistent, not flashy. A 2005 bowling.com article stated, \\"If you were to compare Major League Baseball superstar Roger Clemens and his 95 mile-per-hour fastball to Tommy Jones' mega-hook power game in bowling, you could compare Johnson's game to another 300-game winner: Chicago Cubs pitcher Greg Maddux, who throws an 85 mph fastball but almost never walks enemy batters because of his pin-point accuracy.\\"Article: \\"Liz Johnson becomes first woman to win a PBA title\\", bowl.com, August 22, 2005.

The majority of the gold work is made in tumbaga alloy, with 30% copper, which imparts meaningful color tonalities to the pieces. History Pre-Columbian cultures of Southwestern Colombia. The Quimbaya culture is marked with number 1 The Quimbaya inhabited the areas corresponding to the modern departments of Quindío, Caldas and Risaralda in Colombia, around the valley of the Cauca River. There is no clear data about when they were initially established; the current best guess is around the 1st century BCE. The Quimbaya people reached their zenith during the 4th to 7th century CE period known as The Quimbaya Classic. The culture's the most emblematic piece comes from this period, a form of poporo known as the Poporo Quimbaya, on exhibit at the Bogotá Gold Museum. The most frequent designs in the art pieces are anthropomorphic, depicting men and women sitting with closed eyes and placid expression, as well as many fruits and forms of poporos. Most of the retrieved items are part of funeral offerings, found inside sarcophagi made of hollow trunks. The gold represented a sacred metal and the passport for the afterlife. Around the 10th century the Quimbaya culture disappeared entirely due to unknown circumstances; studies of the archeological items point to an advanced cultural development and the political structure of a cacicazgo with separated groups dedicated to pottery, religion, trade, gold work and war. Economy Living in the temperate tropical climate of the coffee belt, they were able to cultivate a wide variety of products: corn and cassava, as a food base, avocados, guava. They were also nourished by fishing and hunting, and they were excellent farmers, with what the land gave them. They were also intense hunters. The hunt provided them with rabbit and deer meat in abundance, but also, as far as is known, they hunted opossums, tapirs, armadillos, foxes and peccaries, among other animals whose remains have been found. Mining was mainly gold. They developed advanced metallurgy techniques to process gold in a way that is full of aesthetics and fine finishes. The name \\"quimbaya\\" has become a traditional generic term to refer to many of the productions and objects found in this geographical area, even if they do not come rigorously from the same ethnic group and come from different epochs in time. Quimbaya technical skill extended beyond the production of goldsmith's pieces, including in the manufacture of oil for lighting, and in textiles, although given the poor geological conditions necessary for their preservation, few examples of textiles have survived. The manufacture of cotton blankets was, in fact, their main industry. As merchants, they exchanged their pieces of metalwork, blankets, textiles and gold, with towns in neighboring regions and beyond. They also produced and traded salt, extracted from the rivers though a technique involving boiling river water using fire and lava. Culture and customs It is discussed if the Quimbaya practiced ritual cannibalism with their war enemies, in festivities or very special celebrations. This cannibalism would have symbolic meanings related to the defeat and revenge of its enemies or to the appropriation of the spirit of the person. However, in the case of the Quimbaya, the chronicles referred to in cannibalism are based on a single testimony about two alleged cases. They displayed human heads as trophies hanging from reeds in the plaza. During the conquest they intensified this practice to instill fear in the conquerors. They paid much attention to their funeral practices, and the constructions of Quimbaya tombs bear witness to this affirmation since, in truth, they elaborated an enormous variety of different tombs according to the specifications of each funeral, in which the offerings that would accompany were always included. The deceased carried these on his way to the next life, including food and weapons to make it easier. In the tombs they also buried most of the pre-Columbian gold objects, personal elements of the dead and some other sacred elements. They believed that all bodies would be resurrected. One of the most famous activities he has done to the Quimbaya is his luxurious goldsmith shop, which enjoys an incredible beauty as well as a perfect technique. They developed metallurgy systems to combine copper with gold that was not abundant in their region (unlike other areas of the country). This combination of gold and copper, called \\"tumbaga\\", would not detract from the attractiveness, brightness and durability of its magnificent pieces, of a spectacular vivacity. One of them, very popular, is the famous poporos. His goldsmithing is one of the most important in America given the exquisite beauty of the pieces expressed by very well developed metallurgical methods. Its culture the way to melt the gold to obtain the exact grade of gold and copper to maintain a high purity, it is still unknown how such quality was achieved since they would need kilns that would reach a thousand degrees Celsius to melt these pieces. Another of the mysteries of the Quimbaya Culture are the Quimbaya artifacts, formerly called \\"Pájaros del Otún\\", since the former was found near the banks of the Otún River in the province of Risaralda. Engravings and petroglyphs of the Quimbayas can be found in the Natural Park of Las Piedras Marcadas, also known as La Marcada. They are located in the path Alto del Toro in the municipality of Dosquebradas Risaralda (Colombia). The stones are a mystery since no one knows exactly their antiquity or its true meaning. They are granitic stones of great hardness and onto their surface is carved spirals, stars, constellations, planets and other strange symbols; it may be some message from the gods that was left for posterity on the hard rock. The Park of the Marked Stones is one of the most unknown and despised parks by the scholars of the Colombian tribes, more interested in the goldsmith and clay works than in the lithic art. Others have related the marks with constellations and even they are related to the Quimbaya artifacts, and their mysterious origin; It is not really known why some were found on the banks of the Otún River when others have been found on the banks of the Cauca or the Magdalena.

It is endemic to Western Australia, occurring near Esperance. The seeds are consumable when prepared correctly and was an important resource to people of the region, but the plant is otherwise toxic to many species. Taxonomy  First described by Ferdinand von Mueller, the current combination as a species of the Australian genus Macrozamia was published by Charles Gardner in 1930. The previously established name, djeeri, is derived from the Nyungar language. Description  A cycad with a large above ground trunk, taking the form of a tree. The foliage is deeply keeled with wide leaflets, and the reproductive cones are narrow and extended. Ecology The species is found in coastal heath on sand in which jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) is absent, restricted in range to the eastern Recherche section of the Esperance Plains bioregion. The seeds of djeeri formed an important part of the human diet, the earliest record of this is the preparation of seed at a cave in Cape Le Grand national park dated at thirteen thousand years old. Investigation of the site revealed a mordak, the instrument used to detoxify the sarcotesta that surrounds the seeds. This seeds were placed in a depression lined with leaf bases of the plant paalaq, Xanthorrhoea platyphylla, another crucial resource in the local culture. The sarcotesta and seeds remains buried for several weeks to become detoxified and consumable, the food product, known as querning, still contains toxins at the centre of the seeds. The distribution of the plant has been correlated to sites of long term human habitation, close to lakes or springs, and freshwater points at granitic outcrops of the kwongan, although the intervention of other consumers, birds and mammals, complicates a postulate that inadvertent or intentional cultivation is the primary factor in seed dispersal. Animals species involved in dispersal of the plant include birds such as the emu and mammalian species Trichosurus vulpecula, a common possum known locally as quumarl. The toxins macrozamin and cycasin are produced by cyanobacteria engaged in nitrogen fixing at their roots.

He was elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Bolton at the 1880 general election along with John Kynaston Cross in the double member constituency, signifying a great victory as two liberals were elected for the first time since 1852. He served for 5 years, when he lost his seat owing to the Home Rule split. He became a Liberal Unionist, although he returned to the Liberal fold eventually. Biography Born on 19 May 1841, third child of Thomas Thomasson and Maria Pennington, he was born into a well known family of Bolton Quakers. In about 1862,he entered the cotton spinning firm founded by his grandfather at Mill Hill, in the Haulgh, Bolton, where he helped run the business of four cotton mills, with great success until 1871, when the partnership was dissolved and he continued with No. 3 mill under the old name of John Thomasson and Son. In 1867 he married Katharine Lucas, a niece of John Bright, and daughter of Margaret Bright Lucas. They lived at Alderly Edge, Cheshire, and had three children, Lucas (1868), Beatrice (1870) and Franklin Thomasson (1873). He was, like his father, an advanced Liberal. In 1873 he was invited to contest the Bolton constituency, but declined. He followed his father in many public benefactions. By 1876 he had given 100 scholarships to the value of £25 each for three years. In 1881 he financed the building of the Haulgh Board School, gave £1,000 towards the founding of the Chadwick Museum, and built the Folds Road gymnasium. In all it is calculated that he gave over £30,000 to the cause of education in the borough. In 1890 he gave Mere Hall, formerly the residence of Sir Benjamin Dobson, to the town as a public park, together with £5,000 towards alterations. This became the original Bolton Art Gallery. As a memorial of his work and in recognition of his services to the borough, the Thomasson Memorial School was erected on Devonshire Road. The school, for blind and deaf children was approved in February 1907. He was made a freeman of the borough in 1902. He died at Heaton, Greater Manchester on 16 May 1904 aged 62.Obituary, The Times, Tuesday, 17 May 1904, p. 10 He was a Unitarian, and a keen supporter of Bank Street Chapel, and his enlightened outlook is proved by the fact that he was an early supporter of the Women's suffrage movement.

Academic quarter exists to a varying extent in many universities, especially where the campus is spread out over a larger area, necessitating the need for fifteen minutes for the students to walk from one building to another between classes. In the German university system, lectures scheduled at a certain hour, with or without the addition \\"c.t.\\" (cum tempore, Latin for \\"with time\\"), usually start 15 minutes after the full hour. If this is not the case, usually \\"s.t.\\" (sine tempore, Latin for \\"without time\\") is added to indicate that the lecture will begin at the exact time. In Polish the phrase kwadrans akademicki refers to an unspoken rule allowing students and lecturers to arrive up to 15 minutes late to a lecture; the students can skip the lecture without repercussions should the lecturer not arrive within that time  Examples  At Uppsala University, the academic quarter was officially abolished in 1982 by Rector Martin H:son Holmdahl, and since then lectures are officially scheduled one quarter after the full hour, e.g. the scheduled starting time of morning lectures is 8:15. In the student social life at Uppsala University and Lund University, a double-quarter (Swedish: dubbelkvart (dk) or dq) also exists. At Uppsala, it refers to the thirty minutes between the full hour and the official time when a banquet or other semi-official party or sit-down dinner starts. During this half-hour, guests mingle and make sure they know where their seats are. At Lund, times are commonly stated meaning single-quartered during daytime and doubly-quartered in the evening after 6 pm and on weekends. Double-quarter means here that the event starts thirty minutes after the posted time. When a starting time is supposed to be exact, it is marked as prick (\\"exact\\" in Swedish), or prickprick for times after 18:00. At KTH the academic quarter is applied to lectures but not to labs. At UC Berkeley, classes generally start 10 minutes after the posted starting time. This is informally known as \\"Berkeley time\\". At the ETH Zurich, classes generally start 15 minutes before or after the posted starting time or on the exact time, depending on the campus on which the classes take place.

It is endemic to New South Wales, Australia. Etymology Macrozamia montana is a distinct species that was named by Ken Hill in 1998 based on its attribute of growing on the sides of mountainous areas, slopes and steep ridges. The Latin specific epithet montana refers to mountains or coming from mountains.Archibald William Smith Description Macrozamia montana is usually a subterrestrial woody stem but sometimes a short developing trunk whose bright green young fronds become dark green and bent when fully grown. During development, the female cones of M. montana have the tendency to change to a horizontal position or completely rest on the ground. It has short petioles of about 6–15 cm long. M. montana plants can have up to a maximum of 70 fronds and glossy leaves of about 100–204 cm long. Relationships Macrozamia montana is part of the genus Macrozamia but is isolated from the rest of the genus. It is more closely related to larger M. communis plants in New South Wales, Australia than the smaller M. communis plants on the north of Newcastle. The petioles of the M. communis however, grow to about 10–40 cm long which is far longer than those of the M. montana. Habitat conditions Macrozamia montana grows under a eucalypt canopy, in wet sclerophyll forests on well-drained soils.

It is endemic to southwest Australia and often occurs in jarrah forests. It may only attain a height of half a metre or form an above trunk up to two metres with long arching fronds of a similar length. The giant cones amidst the crown of palm-like fronds contain edible seeds surrounded by red sarcotesta. The seeds are consumed by birds and animals, and can be a favoured part of the human diet when prepared correctly. M. riedlei benefits from a close association with bacteria that fix nitrogen, which also produce substances found throughout the plant that are toxic to some animals when consumed. The species is cultivated for ornamental use in urban and domestic environments. Description Macrozamia riedlei grows as a tree or trunkless low growing cycad (but is usually trunkless) attaining a height between . Between 12 and 30 glossy mid- to dark-green leaves emerge from its crown, each reaching long and bearing 92–150 pinnae. The leaves are palm-like, each frond having a thickened mid-rib with the pinnae evenly arranged at either side. The flowering period occurs between September and October. The dioecious genus is noted for the large size of the reproductive structure, and this species is remarkable in several of those aspects. The female cone measures wide and long, and the weight has been recorded up to ; the eggs and spermatozoids are visible to the naked eye. The cones persist on the plant for many months, the smaller pollen-bearing cone remaining green and the larger female cone becoming prominently red. Spores are contained in small box-like structures on the underside of the leaf until ripe, a similar structure at the receptive cone is reduced to two seeds that remain attached to the leaf. It differs from other West Australian macrozamias in that it is generally trunkless, smaller, has fewer and glossier flat leaves, and has smaller cones. Taxonomy  The first species description was published as Cycas riedlei by Friedrich Ernst Ludwig von Fischer, based on a specimen collected at King George Sound and held at the Paris museum.Published in:Gaudichaud-Beaupre, C. (1829), Voyage Autour du Monde ... sur les Corvettes de S.M. l'Uranie et la Physicienne. Botanique 11: 434 The species name honours French gardener Anselme Riedlé. An orthographic variant—M. r _ei_ dlei— was used by the revising author, Charles Gardner, when assigning it to the genus Macrozamia and citing specimens obtained near Collie, Manjimup, Bow Bridge, and other sites south of Perth. The colonists applied the term zamia and zamia palm to the once common plant, this continued to be given in some listings and guides. The names in the local language for the plant are baian, djiriji, koondagoor and quinning. Different names are applied to various parts of the plants and its products, most of which has had some application as food or material resource.  Distribution  Occurring on lateritic soils, often in Jarrah forest, it is an endemic species of southern Western Australia. It is found from the southwestern coast east to Dwellingup and Albany. The species also occurs at the west of the Esperance Plains and on the Swan Coastal Plain.  Ecology  The 'nuts' from this plant have been successfully used as food by Indigenous Australians after proper processing; however, when eaten by European explorers they incurred poisoning: The Willem de Vlamingh incident, the earliest episode of a European poisoning themselves with an Australian plant, was recorded as an unsigned entry in the ship's journal, the officer being one of several who ventured to eat the seeds while exploring the Swan River area. Ingestion of the unprepared seed induced vomiting after several hours, that was described as putting those afflicted as so bilious there \\"was hardly any difference between us and death\\". The incident was further embellished in a second-hand report published in Amsterdam, portraying men incapacitated by involuntary movements. The poisoning of the crew on the disastrous La Perouse expedition was noted by Governor PhillipCited in Barton, G.B., 1889. History of New South Wales from the records as resulting in the same violent vomiting. Some crew members of the circumnavigation expedition led by Matthew Flinders made a similar error, consuming the toxins of M. riedlei while anchored at the south coast. At the founding of the Swan River Colony in 1829 Captain Fremantle was the first to taste three of the 'ground nuts' found at a local camp-fire, describing the taste as inoffensive and similar to 'roast potato'. He awoke the next morning with the symptoms of poisoning and recovered later that day after taking tea as an emetic and a period of sleep. Charles Fremantle testily records that despite witnessing and being informed of the consequences of eating the same, many of the men and two officers did just that and some suffered severe reactions. The misadventure of George Grey's party occurred 13 April 1839, while undertaking a journey to Perth after being shipwrecked on Gantheaume Bay at Kalbarri. The party was lightly supplied with rations and overlooked the harvest of food resources as they scrambled on their 300 km journey. They had been shown and fed a small amount of prepared seed, and later sought and found fresh seed. Not having been properly prepared, the meal temporarily debilitated them. The species known as by-yu and djiriji was an important plant to the Nyungar people once processed, the flesh around the seeds a staple food; this is comparable with the use of many cycads around the world. The stem also provides starch that was used by colonials as 'bush flour', a substitute for flour derived from introduced grains. Evarist (1979) notes that early settlers observed aboriginal practices and used the starch from the pith of the trunk (for food) \\"after drying, shredding, soaking in water for several hours, filtering, settling, washing several times, drying slowly and powdering. Aside from finding the foodstuff at Nyungar camps, or offered it when hungry, early visitors and colonists recorded people harvesting the fruit. In 1832, the newcomer Henry Camfield noted the elder Midgegoroo and others gathering the nuts where he had settled at Burswood, Western Australia. The preparation of the seeds is a method known to the people as mordak, an excavation at a cave in Cape Le Grand national park of a nearly intact example was dated at thirteen thousand years old.The archaeological survey identified an intact mordak with seeds of Macrozamia dyeri, another harvested species of Southwest Australia. The ripe and unprepared seed of M. riedlei is known as pauyin, this is able to be harvested toward the end of March, after the austral summer. The informal names 'wobbles' and 'rickets' were used by the settlers, describing the effect on cattle allowed to graze on them. This affliction of the introduced mammal, the result of ingesting the leaves, began with paralysis of the rear quarters and resulted in their death, leading the settlers to attempt eradication of the species where they grazed. The toxins contained in the cone and other parts of the plant, macrozamin and cycasin, are produced in coralloid roots by nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria. The coralloid root system is a symbiosis of the cycad's roots and cyanobacteria of the genera Nostoc and Calothrix. In M. riedlei the nitrogen (N2) capture is most active in wet seasons and nitrogen content is doubled within 8–11 years. Examination of the response to recent burns found the weight ratio of coralloid roots to the bole increased and the concentration of nitrogen at the roots was higher, suggesting nitrogen fixation met the need of rapid leaf regrowth that occurs after these events. Avian and mammalian species are attracted to the reproductive cone structure, insects are involved in the pollination of the female plant. The birds include a western rosella subspecies (moyadong, Platycercus icterotis icterotis) which eat the fleshy part of the seed cone, other birds known to eat the seeds include the emu, common bronzewing pigeon (Phaps chalcoptera), white-tailed black cockatoo, and common species silvereye, grey butcherbird and raven (wodang; Corvus coronoides). Mammal species recorded at the plant are the western grey kangaroo (Macropus fuliginosus), western brush wallaby (Macropus irma), quokka (Setonix brachyurus), common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) and western quoll (Dasyurus geoffroii). The Catholic Church of Western Australia has substituted the fronds for those of palm trees on Palm Sunday. The ancient form of the plant inspired the poet Judith Wright to pen the lines, { align=\\"center\\" - style= \\"font-size: 87%; \\" Among the complicated birds and flowers They seem a generation carved in stone. — Wright, J. } Cultivation Macrozamia riedlei has horticultural potential as a large container plant or specimen plant. It grows in well-drained soil and is sensitive to fungal attack. Large specimens can be transplanted. Seed germinates in 12 to 18 months. Cultivated specimen at Parque Terra Nostra in Furnas, on the island of São Miguel in the Azores Most of the genus Macrozamia are cultivated and M. riedlei is one of the better known species. The plant is well suited to rockeries and containers (Wrigley & Fagg, 2003). The trunk may reach two metres in cultivation, the pinnate fronds, dark green and palm-like, also reach or exceed two metres as specimens advance in age. The urban garden plant resembles the size of those seen in the field, one or two metres in height, although they are slow growing in their native habitat; container planting tend to produce smaller sized specimens. They respond well to applications of a general fertiliser, and favour full sun or partial shade. They are a recommended indoor plant, being tolerant of low light and temperature, slow growing and able to remain in a container indefinitely. The distribution of the zamia in the southwest has been correlated to sites of long term human habitation, close to lakes or springs, and freshwater points at granitic outcrops of the kwongan, although the intervention of other consumers, birds and mammals, complicates a postulate that inadvertent or intentional cultivation is the primary factor in seed dispersal. Animals species involved in dispersal of the plant include birds such as the emu and mammalian species Trichosurus vulpecula, a common possum known locally as quumarl. The fruiting cone begins to fully ripen and break apart during the local season bunura, which occurs between February and March, and is ready to harvest.

It is endemic to New South Wales in eastern Australia, where it is found in sclerophyll forest on low-nutrient soils. Plants generally lack a trunk and have 2–12 leaves that range up to 100 cm (40 in) in length. Taxonomy Richard Anthony Salisbury described this species as Zamia spiralis in 1796, from a collection made somewhere in the vicinity of Port Jackson (Sydney); however, no type specimen is extant. Dutch botanist Friedrich Anton Wilhelm Miquel gave it its current name in 1842. Meanwhile, Joseph Dalton Hooker described M. corallipes from a plate in 1872. For many years, the name M. spiralis was applied to the large common cycad from the Sydney region, while its smaller relative was known as M. corallipes. In 1959, New South Wales Herbarium botanist Lawrie Johnson examined the species descriptions and determined that Salisbury's original description was in fact of the smaller species, and renamed the familiar burrawang as Macrozamia communis. Description This cycad is acaulescent; the 8–20 cm (3.2–8 in) diameter stem does not generally grow above ground level. Plants have 2–12 leaves that range from 35 to 100 cm (14–40 in) in length. Each compound frond has 45–120 simple pinnae that are 12–20 cm (4.5–8 in) long at the leaf's greatest width. Each pinna is 0.5–1 cm (0.2–0.4 in) wide.

A male plant develops 1 to 4 male (or pollen-bearing) cones, which are fusiform (spindle-shaped), and measure 15–20 cm (6–8 in) high by 5–6 cm (2-2.4 in) wide. The female plant produces a single oval female (seed) cone, which is 12–20 cm (4.5–8 in) high and 6–9 cm (2.4–3.5 in) wide. The orange to red fleshy seeds have been reported to be ripe in April and May. Plants do not reproduce until 10 to 20 years of age and are thought to live over 60 years. They regrow from the ground after bushfire. Seedlings of Macrozamia spiralis have a tuber and coralloid roots that rise up above the ground containing cyanobacteria. These exist in a symbiotic relationship with their cycad host by nitrogen fixation. Field work done on roots of 74 cycads from diverse genera in 2010 showed that the relationship between cycad and cyanobacterium species is not exclusive; the most common genera of cyanobacteria isolated from cycads were those of Nostoc (which was isolated from M. spiralis) and Calothrix. Distribution and habitat Macrozamia spiralis is found in central New South Wales, from Dunedoo and the Goulburn River valley eastwards over the Blue Mountains and into the Sydney Basin south to Waterfall, and Wallacia, and north to Maroota and Putty. Conservation areas that it is protected in include Werakata National Park, Windsor Downs Nature Reserve, Agnes Banks Nature Reserve, and Castlereagh Nature Reserve, where it is common. Scattered plants grow on clay, sandy or gravelly low-nutrient soils in sclerophyll forest, under such trees as narrow-leaved apple (Angophora bakeri) and broad-leaved red ironbark (Eucalyptus fibrosa). Macrozamia spiralis was rated as endangered in 2003. Cultivation Macrozamia spiralis is suitable for growing in pots or in the ground, though requires good drainage and benefits from extra water in dry periods. It can be grown under established trees. It can be propagated by seed, though germination takes 12 to 18 months.  Uses  The plant has been used to produce alcohol, adhesive pastes, and laundry starch.

The episcopal see is located in the city of Moulins. The diocese comprises all of the department of Allier in the region of Auvergne. History The diocese was created in 1788, but the new bishop, Étienne-Jean- Baptiste-Louis des Gallois de la Tour, although appointed by King Louis XVI on 29 May 1789, had not been approved (preconized) by Pope Pius VI before the outbreak of the French Revolution in July 1789.Fisquet, p. 165. Under the Civil Constitution of the Clergy (12 July 1790) there was erected a diocese of Allier, with a Constitutional Bishop resident at Moulins. The French government, however, did not have the canonical power to erect dioceses, and therefore this new diocese was in schism with Rome. The first Constitutional Bishop, Msgr. François-Xavier Laurent, had been a curé in the diocese of Autun before becoming a member of the Estates General; after his election by the voters of Allier, he was consecrated in Paris on 6 March 1791 by Constitutional Bishop Gobel. In 1793 he abdicated and married. Laurent died in 1796, Fisquet, p. 166. or 10 May 1821.Pisani, p. 97. The appointment and consecration of Laurent, as well as the erection of the Diocese of Allier, were annulled by Pope Pius VI. Laurent's consecration was labelled blasphemous and schismatic. Under the Concordat of 11 June 1817 the diocese of Moulins was re-established, from parts of the dioceses of Autun, Bourges, and Clermont- Ferrand, to cover the department of Allier. The implementation of the Concordat was delayed, however, by various circumstances brought about by the Hundred Days and the occupation of France by the Allies, as well as by the lack of funds both on the part of the French monarchy and the Papacy, to say nothing about the machinations of ministers and diplomats. On 6 October 1822, Pope Pius VII issued a bull which created fourteen dioceses in France, including Moulins. The first bishop was appointed in 1822, and in the same year the medieval collegiate church at Moulins was established as the Cathedral of Notre-Dame, the seat of the diocese. The diocese of Moulins was made a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Sens. This situation continued until 8 December 2002, when a major reorganization of the French diocesan structure made Moulins a suffragan of the Archbishop of Clermont.David M. Cheney, Catholic-Hierarchy.org, Diocese of Moulins, retrieved: 2017-01-29. The current bishop is Laurent Jean Lucien Marie Percerou, appointed in 2013.

During his exile, he became Almoner to the Duchess of Angoulême. He returned in 1801. When the Concordat of 1817 was finally put into effect by papal action in 1822, Pons was appointed Bishop of Moulins by King Louis XVIII on 6 January 1822. His appointment was confirmed (preconized) by Pope Pius VII on 16 May 1823, and a royal ordinance of 2 July 1823 permitted Pons to receive the bulls for his consecration and installation. He was consecrated in Paris on 13 July by the Archbishop of Paris, Hyacinthe-Louis de Quelen, and took possession of his diocese by proxy on 29 July 1823.

Williams. The film was written and directed by Craig Bolotin, and produced by Kenneth \\"Babyface\\" Edmonds and his wife Tracy Edmonds. The film follows six teenage high school seniors who hold a wounded police officer hostage and barricade themselves inside the school. Plot summary In an urban Queens high school students, senior Lester DeWitt (Usher Raymond), who lost his father, his best friend, 15-year-old artist Zacharias 'Ziggy' Malone (Robert Ri'chard), hard- working senior Stephanie Williams (Rosario Dawson), criminal Rodney J. Templeton (Fredro Starr), rebellious pregnant Lynn Sabatini (Sara Gilbert), and hustler Robert Tremont a.k.a. \\"Rivers\\" (Clifton Collins, Jr.), attend the history class of the caring Ken Knowles (Judd Nelson). Police officer Dante Jackson (Forest Whitaker) tries to arrest Lester after a misunderstanding when the classroom's windows are broken by rocks. Mr. Knowles takes them to the principal's office, where Principal Allen Armstrong (Glynn Turman) tells Knowles to take them \\"anywhere\\". Since there is no space anywhere in the school, Knowles and the kids go to a local diner, where a robbery takes place. Knowles confronts the robber, who was a former student that dropped out of school. Principal Armstrong is infuriated by what Knowles has done, and puts him on administrative leave. Lester, Stephanie and Ziggy are at the main office as Knowles leaves the school. Stephanie is disgusted that Principal Armstrong has ignored that he told Knowles to \\"take the class anywhere\\" and confronts him about this. In response Principal Armstrong suspends Rivers, Ziggy, Stephanie and Lester from the school and calls in Officer Jackson to remove all of them. Ziggy decides to leave but Officer Jackson restrains him. This event is witnessed by other students at the school and soon everything turns into a small riot. Lester tries to resist Officer Jackson and loses, but Ziggy picks up Officer Jackson's dropped Glock 19 pistol and says \\"I [Ziggy] cannot go home.\\" The reason for this, is because Ziggy has been physically abused by his father for many years. Officer Jackson tries to restrain Ziggy but gets accidentally shot in the leg as he grabs for his gun. Principal Armstrong tells school security to call an ambulance and the N.Y.P.D. in order to arrest Ziggy. Lester then grabs the gun and orders everyone to evacuate the school. This finally forces the N.Y.P.D. detectives to come in, led by Detective Audrey McDonald (Vanessa L. Williams) as a negotiator. In the middle of all of this, there is a subplot in which Lynn berates Stephanie for being a \\"goody-two shoes\\", and a fight in the school's library that includes Rivers and Rodney, as well as Officer Jackson fleeing from Rodney and the others after knocking him out to use the bathroom. Another notable subplot was Ziggy showing everyone his artistic talents, such being a mural of himself and others on a classroom wall. Still waiting after a couple of hours, the group continues to hold Officer Dante Jackson against his will. Lester tells everybody, including Stephanie and Dante about how his father (Robert Lee Minor) who was gunned down during a wrongful arrest. In the next few scenes, Rivers, Lynn, Rodney, Ziggy, Stephanie, and Lester, a.k.a. \\"The Lincoln 6\\", are all becoming infamous across New York City, as they are exposed and identified on such networks such as BET, VH1, NBC, NY1 and CBS, as well as MTV, as well being announced on radio. Debate continues as the events taking place, until Detective McDonald and her colleague (Vic Polizos) debate on getting the kids something, which after several hours of stalling, the electricity being shut down at the school and the SWAT team storming in on the others as Lester takes Officer Jackson on top of the roof. There, Lester tells Officer Jackson that he resents all policemen for what has happened to his father, and Jackson tries to reassure him. Lester surrenders and Jackson consoles him. The comforting moment is short lived when Rodney grabs Officer Jackson from behind to finish the job and Lester trying to talk him out of it. In the midst of all this, Captain Monroe orders a sniper on a helicopter to take out Lester. Things go horribly wrong when Ziggy rushes onto the roof and is shot down by a sniper aimed for Lester. Lester runs to Ziggy's aid and comforts him while waiting for help. A dying Ziggy tells Lester he finally stood up and makes Lester promise him to tell everyone why they did what they did. Lester promises and Ziggy dies in his arms. The next day the remaining 5 students are arrested and taken into custody. As the film reaches its climax, the narrator (Ziggy) talks about what happened to the kids and the officer: Officer Jackson testified in court that the events did not happen as the media have portrayed them, thus giving the kids a less sentence. Lester spent two years in state prison and has gone off to a city college to study law. Stephanie spent one year in prison and went to study at St. John's University. Lynn was sentenced to one year in prison, but was released earlier due to having her baby boy (named after Ziggy) and is never heard from again. Rodney spends an unknown amount of time in prison and becomes a Muslim, Rivers is forced to join the military, due to the judge having him spend years in prison due to his priors or join the army. Mr. Knowles has been rehired back to the school and still teaches history. Lester kept his promise to Ziggy and comes back to Lincoln every year to tell other students their story and how what they did and Ziggy's death changed Lincoln forever. The end also shows Lester and Stephanie looking a painting that was crafted by Ziggy, who is forever remembered as the next Jean-Michel Basquiat a.k.a. \\"The Radiant Child\\".

It was formerly known as Saint-Gengoux- le-Royal. History Church in Saint-Gengoux-le-National Historic house in Saint-Gengoux-le-National In the 10th century, the church of Saint-Gengoux was given to the abbey of Cluny. In the 12th century, the abbot of Cluny requested king Louis VII install a lord of the manor with Saint-Gengoux in order to ensure the safety of the city. At the revolution, Saint-Gengoux-le-Royal took the name of Saint-Gengoux-le-National. It reverted to Saint-Gengoux-le-Royal is 1834, Saint-Gengoux-le-National in 1848, Saint-Gengoux-le-Royal in 1852 before finally settling on Saint-Gengoux-le-National in 1881. Geography The river Grosne forms part of the commune's south-eastern border. Notable buildings The church was built in 1120 by the Benedictines of Cluny. It measures 41 m in length and 16 m wide. It was plundered several times and has been heavily restored. The most recent enhancement has been the replacement of the metal bridge between the towers with a wooden one, more in keeping with the Burgundian style. In 1802, three vaults contiguous to the church were destroyed to build a corn exchange on their site. There are many historic properties from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Transport The railway station buildings in Saint-Gengoux-le-National The railway station at Saint-Gengoux-le-National was opened in 1880 on the Chalon-sur-Saône to Mâcon railway line. After the closure of the railway, in 1996 the 44 km of trackbed from Givry to Cluny has been paved and converted into a cycle route known as the Voie Verte.

Leaf Almost extinct species of this tree has been rediscovered after a gap of 180 years from a sacred grove in Kollam district. Scientists at the Jawaharlal Nehru Tropical Botanic Garden and Research Institute (JNTBGRI) have identified the tree as Madhuca diplostemon (family Sapotaceae), a threatened species of the Western Ghats whose specimen was first collected in 1835. The lone mature tree was located at the Koonayil Ayiravilli Siva temple at Paravur, Kollam, Kerala. Locally it was believed to be the common attilippa. Shailaja Kumari, one of the authors of this paper, had collected a specimen and brought it to the JNTBGRI two years ago as part of her Ph.D. dissertation. Survey in other sacred groves in Kollam district failed to find another tree of the species. Since the species is represented by only one specimen in a single locality, it is eligible to be categorized as 'Critically Endangered' by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature), the JNTBGRI has noted.

Sir George Pretyman Tomline, 5th Baronet (born George Pretyman; 9 October 1750 – 14 November 1827) was an English clergyman, theologian, Bishop of Lincoln and then Bishop of Winchester, and confidant of William Pitt the Younger. He was an opponent of Catholic emancipation. Early life He was born George Pretyman in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk to a family claiming to have been influential in the region as far back as the fourteenth century. His father, also George Pretyman (1722–1810) was a landowner and wool merchant. His mother, George's wife, was Susan née Hubbard (1720/1721–1807). Pretyman attended Bury St Edmunds Grammar School and then Pembroke College, Cambridge, graduating in 1772 as senior wrangler and Smith's prizewinner. He was elected a fellow of Pembroke in 1773. He was ordained deacon in 1774 and priest in 1776: by Philip Yonge, Bishop of Norwich at his Palace's chapel on 14 August 1774 and by John Hinchliffe, Bishop of Peterborough at Trinity College, Cambridge on 16 June 1776. William Pitt the Younger was sent to Pembroke in 1773, at the age of fourteen, and Pretyman became his tutor and gradually his friend and confidant.Hague (2005) p27 When Pitt unsuccessfully stood for election as Member of Parliament for Cambridge University in the 1780 British general election, Pretyman supported him. Pitt became Prime Minister of Great Britain in December 1783 when the Fox-North Coalition fell but it remained for him to win the 1784 British general election. On his 1784 victory, Pitt made Pretyman his private secretary, though the title was thought inappropriate for a clergyman. Pretyman's mathematical ability was soon called upon in advising Pitt on the sinking fund and other technicalities of fiscal policy. On 3 September 1784, Pretyman married Elizabeth Maltby (died 13 June 1826), cousin of Edward Maltby, the future Bishop of Chichester and himself eighth wrangler, and appointed Edward his domestic chaplain.Varley, E. A. (2004) \\"Maltby, Edward (1770–1859)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, accessed 11 Aug 2007 (subscription required) George and Elizabeth were well-matched and he constantly consulted her on church and political issues. On 17 March 1785 Tomline was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Bishop of Lincoln In 1787, Pitt appointed Pretyman Bishop of Lincoln, having to overcome the opposition of George III who objected to Pretyman's youth. Having already become Dean of St Paul's (he was instituted to the Portpoole prebend by Robert Lowth, Bishop of London on 21 February 1787), his election was confirmed by John Moore, Archbishop of Canterbury, at St Mary-le-Bow on 10 March 1787 and he was consecrated a bishop by Moore (assisted by William Ashburnham, Bishop of Chichester; Shute Barrington, Bishop of Salisbury and Beilby Porteus, Bishop of Chester) at Lambeth Palace chapel on 11 March 1787. Pretyman maintained on close terms with Pitt, though Lincoln duties kept him from frequent visits to London, and shared Whig attitudes. In a sermon to the House of Lords on 30 January 1789, Pretyman condemned Charles I, executed by parliament in 1649, and praised his political opponents. John Wesley wrote to Pretyman in 1790 accusing him of driving the 'people called Methodists' out of the established church.http://wesley.nnu.edu/john-wesley/the-letters-of-john- wesley/wesleys-letters-1790a Pretyman continued to advise Pitt on finance and on Pitt's Ecclesiastical Plan. Pretyman was an opponent of Catholic emancipation and was against Pitt's 1801 decision to resign when he failed to effect the changes promised to the Irish Catholics in the compromises made over the passage of the Act of Union 1800. Henry Addington's regime was still less to Pretyman's taste and his anti-Catholic sentiments strengthened. However, he remained on good terms with Pitt and was ready to help him out of his debts. Pitt's second ministry Already wealthy, in 1803 he inherited extensive property from the unrelated, Marmaduke Tomline, and took the name Tomline. Pitt returned to government in 1804 and, much to Tomline's satisfaction, promoted Tomline as Archbishop of Canterbury, even though there was an earlier provisional agreement with the King that Charles Manners-Sutton should be appointed. However, the King was not to be manœuvred and exercised his royal prerogative to appoint Manners-Sutton. Tomline was offered the post of Bishop of London in 1813 but declined because he thought the duties too onerous. He was translated to Bishop of Winchester by the confirmation of his election (by Manners-Sutton) on 15 August 1820. Family and death Memorial in Winchester Cathedral Tomline had inherited further property before he died of apoplexy at Kingston Hall, near Wimborne, Dorset and his estate was worth £200,000 (). He was buried in Winchester Cathedral. His monument was sculpted by Richard Westmacott (the younger).Dictionary of British Sculptors 1660–1851, Rupert Gunnis Tomline and his wife had three sons but they relinquished their claim to the baronetcy: *William Edward Tomline (1787–1836),Gooding (2003) MP for, successively, Christchurch, Truro, and Minehead. *George-Thomas Tomline, became Chancellor of Lincoln and prebendary of Winchester. *Richard Tomline, his third son, became precentor of Lincoln. Works Tomline published the following works: *Elements of Christian Theology (1799), 2 vols., with the 12th and last edition printed in 1826. It was designed for candidates for ordination. Henry Stebbing published a revision, in 1843. *A Refutation of Calvinism (1803), the 8th and final edition printed in 1823. This was a controversial work, causing a debate that involved Thomas Scott, Edward Williams, John Chetwode Eustace, and some anonymous writers. *Memoir of the Life of the Right Honorable William Pitt, 2 vols. (John Murray, Albemarle- Street, London, 1821). It goes no further than 1793. Personality He was an able administrator to his diocese, conducting eleven visitations during his thirty three years tenure. Though he appeared somewhat aloof in public, Tomline was a devoted family man and genial enough given the right company. From 1806, he was conservative as to his attitudes to church and state but was well respected by someone of as different an outlook as Samuel Parr.

He was the first concertmaster of the London Symphony Orchestra for nearly 20 years, having stepped down in October 2017 to concentrate on directing and teaching. Born in a music loving family Gordan Nikolitch began playing the violin when he was seven. He studied at the music conservatory in Basel, Switzerland, with Jean-Jacques Kantorow. He also met and worked with Walter Levin, Wytold Lutoslavsky, György Kurtág, Hans Werner Henze etc, cultivating an interest in contemporary music. As a violinist, he participated and was awarded in many competitions, the Tibor Varga competition, Paganini competition at Genoa, Italy, Brescia and Vaclav Hummel competition Zagreb. In 1989, he became concertmaster of Orchestre d'Auvergne,post he held until 1999. Nikolitch has been as well the leader of the Orchestre de Chambre de Lausanne and the Chamber Orchestra of Europe. Prince consort professor at the Royal College of Music in London, giving masterclasses at Guildhall School of Music and Drama, he also teaches Master since 2005 at the CODARTS, Rotterdam Conservatory of Music and since 2017 he is Professor at the Hochschule für Musik Saarbrücken. In 2004 he was named artistic director of the Netherlands Chamber Orchestra, Amsterdam, a group created in the 50es by Szymon Goldberg, the great concertmaster of the Berlin Philharmonic from the times of their conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler. It was more than natural to take the same approach of directing from the concertmaster position and the hundreds of concerts played in the Concertgebouw Amsterdam have been oriented towards the most flexible interaction of all musicians involved. Playing in the hall of the Royal Concertgebouw with this profoundly motivated group of great musicians became a constant source of inspiration that helps greatly define the (ever moving) platform of ideas on music making. 2006-2011 he was Musical Director of St George Strings, an orchestra based in Belgrade, Serbia. Since 2007 Musical Director of BandArt orchestra, considered by many as one of the most interesting orchestras today with among other performances of operas Gluck’s Orpheo, and Mozart’s Idomeneo, in festivals of Peralada, Ludwigsbourg, Luzern. The latest collaboration with OSCyL, with on the programme the Schubert “unfinished” and Bruckner 9th symphonies has been again one of the highlights saluted by an enthusiastic public and reviews. Nikolitch shares his experience by directing many other orchestras, among them Orquesta Nacional d'España, Orquesta d'opera Madrid, Orchestre National D'ile de France, London Symphony Orchestra, Orchestre de chambre de Geneve, Antwerp Symphony Orchestra, Tapiola Sinfonietta, Australian Chamber Orchestra, Manchester Camerata, Radio Simfonijski orkestar Slovenija, OSCyL etc. He plays violins by Paul Belin fecit anno 2016 and a Petrus Guarnerius Venice offered graciously to use by a generous sponsor, bows by F.X.

The 12-page one-act was written in 1930 while Williams was a freshman at University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri and submitted to a contest run by the school's Dramatic Arts Club.Spoto (1985). p. 33. Beauty was staged in competition and became the first freshman play ever to be selected for citation (it was awarded honorable mention); the college paper noted that it was \\"a play with an original and constructive idea, but the handling is too didactic and the dialog often too moralistic.\\". The play tells the story of a South Pacific missionary, Abelard, and his wife, Mabel, and \\"both endorses the minister's life and corrects his tendency to Victorian prudery.\\" =Why Do You Smoke So Much, Lily?= Why Do You Smoke So Much, Lily? was written in February 1935. In it, Lily, a frustrated chain-smoking young woman, is hounded by her mother. After being discovered in the papers left to the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, \\"Lily\\" was first produced by the Chattanooga Theatre Centre (Chattanooga, TN) as part of the Fellowship of Southern Writers' Conference on Southern Literature, a biennial event that was hosted by the influential Arts and Education Council of Chattanooga. =Cairo! Shanghai! Bombay!= Cairo, Shanghai, Bombay! was Williams' first produced play. He wrote it in 1935 while he was staying in the Midtown, Memphis home of his grandparents. It was first performed July 12, 1935, by the Garden Players community theater in Memphis, Tennessee.Kimberly Richard and Christina Rossini. Theatre Three, Inc. The Education Zone. Author Biography — Tennessee Williams. (Thomas Lanier Williams III). 2006. Regarding this production, Williams wrote, \\"The laughter ... enchanted me. Then and there the theatre and I found each other for better and for worse. I know it's the only thing that saved my life.\\"Tennessee State Historical Marker 2 May 2008. =The Magic Tower= The Magic Tower was written quickly by Williams in April 1936 in order to meet the deadline for a one-act play contest sponsored by the Webster Groves Theatre Guild in St. Louis, Missouri.Leverich (1995). p. 167. Williams won first place and The Magic Tower was performed by the Guild on October 13, 1936, to positive reviews.Leverich (1995). p. 185. The play tells the story of a young artist and his ex-actress wife living in a slum that they refer to as their \\"magic tower,\\" following them as their optimism gradually fades. =Summer at the Lake= Written in 1937 under the title Escape, Summer at the Lake was unproduced until November 11, 2004, when it opened at the New York City Center in a collection of rarely seen Williams one-acts titled Five by Tenn. The autobiographical play tells the story of Donald Fenway, a sensitive teenager who feels trapped by his self-absorbed Southern mother and his shoe-company executive father, who wants him to abandon his plans for college and find a menial job. The play was interpreted by several critics as \\"an early snapshot\\" of the characters and themes that later appeared in Williams' breakthrough 1944 play The Glass Menagerie, which also focused on a combative mother and a dreamy son bent on escape. =The Palooka= The Palooka is a 1937 one-act about an old has-been boxer. The characters are The Palooka (Galveston Joe), The Kid and The Trainer. The Kid is nervous about his first fight, and The Palooka relieves the Kid's anxiety by telling about the fictional life he wanted to lead after he retired as Galveston Joe. Its world premiere was presented by the Chattanooga Theatre Centre (Chattanooga, TN) as part of the Fellowship of Southern Writers' Southern Writers Conference in 2000, and was later performed on October 2, 2003, by the Hartford Stage Company in Hartford, Connecticut. =The Fat Man's Wife= The Fat Man's Wife was written by Williams in 1938 but remained unproduced until November 11, 2004, when it opened at the New York City Center in a collection of rarely seen Williams one-acts titled Five by Tenn. The play tells the story of Vera Cartwright, a sophisticated Manhattan society lady who is forced to choose between her boorish husband, a theatrical producer, and a young playwright who has become her admirer. The Fat Man's Wife received the sharpest criticism of any of the five exhumed plays; in The New Yorker, John Lahr called it a \\"heterosexual fantasy awash with false emotion and bad writing,\\" and The New York Times noted that \\"Williams is obviously attempting to write in a style entirely alien to him, trying on a faux-urbane manner that fits him like a rented tuxedo in the wrong size.\\" =Adam and Eve on a Ferry= Adam and Eve on a Ferry was written in 1939. It contains three characters: D.H. Lawrence, his wife Frieda, and a female visitor named Ariadne. Ariadne comes seeking D.H. Lawrence because she had a run-in on a boat with a man, and wants romance and sex advice from Lawrence. The setting is described as \\"The sun porch of a villa in the Alps Maritimes.\\" The only things mentioned on the stage are numerous potted plants, two wicker chairs, and \\"a banner bearing the woven figure of a phoenix in a nest of flames.\\" Ariadne is described as plain and \\"spinsterish looking,\\" and she wears a hat, while Lawrence sports a \\"gold satin dressing robe with a lavender shawl.\\" 1940s =The Parade, or Approaching the End of a Summer= The Parade, or Approaching the End of a Summer is a short autobiographical play that was written in 1941. The Parade is set on the wharfs of Provincetown, Massachusetts, and tells the story of a young playwright named Don dealing with his unrequited homosexual love for another man. The situations and characters in the play were \\"clearly drawn from a very autobiographical foundation,\\"Sanderson, Jordan, and Raymond W. Wachter. \\"Something Cloudy, Something Clear\\" (fee required), Literary Encyclopedia, 2005-03-03. Retrieved on 2007-05-30. with Don's dilemma reflecting a relationship Williams had in Provincetown with \\"his actual lover for [one] summer, Kip Kiernan.\\" The Parade was written after a fight with Kiernan, and Williams reflected in 1962 that \\"[the version of Kip in that play] is very, in fact completely different from Kip as he was. When someone hurts us deeply, we no longer see them at all clearly. Not until time has put them back in focus.\\"Leverich (1995). p. 364. That year, Williams retitled and expanded The Parade into a full-length play that was produced in 1981 as Something Cloudy, Something Clear. The Parade was not performed until 2006, when it opened on October 1 in Provincetown as part of the First Annual Provincetown Tennessee Williams Festival by Shakespeare on the Cape. Original cast members: Ben Griessmeyer, Vanessa Caye, Elliot Eustis, Megan Bartle, David Landon. Co-Directed by Jef Hall-Flavin and Eric Powell Holm. =The Long Goodbye= The Long Goodbye is a 1940 one-act that deals with the male main character's memories of his life from when his family consisted of four people through his father leaving the family, his mother's death, and his sister's fall from grace. The scheme of the play consists of the main character moving out of the apartment he grew up in while experiencing extreme flashbacks of both terrible and glorious moments in his past. =Auto Da Fé= Auto Da Fé was written in 1941. The plot concerns a young postal worker, Eloi, whose sexuality is repressed by a rigidly moralistic mother. =The Lady of Larkspur Lotion= The Lady of Larkspur Lotion was written in 1941. It depicts the conflict between a dreamy, delusional heroine (à la Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire) and her brusque, practical landlady, who wants to kick her out of her apartment. A 1973 summer production was staged by Producer, William T. Gardner, at the Academy Playhouse, Lake Forest, Illinois, Directed by José Quintero. =At Liberty= At Liberty was written in 1941 and tells the story of a once-successful actress who retreats to her childhood home in Mississippi, with fantasies of resuscitating her career. =Portrait of a Madonna= In January 1941, Williams completed a one-act play centering on \\"a deranged spinster living in poverty and with her memories of a former lover.\\"Spoto (1985). p. 87. Variously titled Port Mad and The Leafless Block, he revised the play in 1944 and renamed it Portrait of a Madonna. After seeing Jessica Tandy's performance in a 1947 West Coast production of Madonna, Williams decided to cast her in the original production of A Streetcar Named Desire. He later wrote, \\"It was instantly apparent to me that Jessica was Blanche [DuBois].\\"Williams (1975). p. 132. =Moony's Kid Don't Cry= Moony's Kid Don't Cry originated as an eight-page melodrama titled Hot Milk at Three in the Morning, which Williams wrote in 1930 at the University of Missouri. Hot Milk was produced at MU in 1932, and was revised and titled Moony's Kid Don't Cry in 1941, when it was published in Margaret Mayorga's Best One Act Plays of 1940.Spoto (1985). p. 89. It was the first of Williams' plays to be published. In both versions of the play, a poor young married couple get into an argument over their child and, eventually, their relationship. =The Strangest Kind of Romance= The Strangest Kind of Romance was written in 1942. The play takes place in a boardinghouse run by the Landlady, who welcomes a new, but troubled, tenant known only as \\"Little Man\\". He develops a strange attachment to a cat named Nitchevo, the pet of the previous tenant. =The Purification= The Purification is the only verse play Tennessee Williams wrote; Williams recalled that it was written in the summer of 1940, although his biographer Lyle Leverich thought it more likely written in spring 1942. It was published in 1944 in the anthology New Directions 1944 under the title Dos Ranchos, or the Purification (in later publications, this was shortened to The Purification). Set on a ranch in the mid-19th century, the play deals with an incestuous brother/sister relationship and a murder trial.Leverich (1995). p. 447. The Purification had its New York debut off- Broadway at the Theatre de Lys on December 8, 1959. =Ten Blocks on the Camino Real= Ten Blocks on the Camino Real is a one-act play that was written in early 1946 and published in Williams' 1948 play collection American Blues; in 1952, the playwright expanded it into a full-length play, Camino Real.Williams (2000.) p. 1033-1034. Williams directs the reader to use the Anglicized pronunciation \\"Cá-mino Réal\\" =This Property Is Condemned= This one-act play was written in 1946. In 1966, the play was expanded into the film of the same name, which starred Natalie Wood and Robert Redford. =27 Wagons Full of Cotton= 27 Wagons Full of Cotton is a 1946 one-act play that Williams referred to as \\"a Mississippi Delta comedy.\\" Jake, a middle-aged, shady cotton gin owner with antiquated equipment burns down the mill of Silva Vacarro, a rival in the cotton business. Being of Sicilian descent, and thus a community outsider, Vacarro, who knows what happened but cannot prove it, seeks revenge by raping Jake's young and voluptuous but childlike and naïve wife Flora. Elia Kazan's controversial 1956 film Baby Doll, which Williams described as a \\"grotesque folk comedy\\", was based on this play and The Unsatisfactory Supper, which has two similar main characters. The name and character of Silva Vacarro is used in Baby Doll. =The Long Stay Cut Short, or The Unsatisfactory Supper= This play was first copyrighted in 1946. Archie Lee and his Baby Doll Meighan, who parallel Jake and Flora in 27 Wagons Full of Cotton, are reluctantly providing a home to Aunt Rose, an elderly relation who has been passed around among the family. An \\"unsatisfactory supper\\" cooked by Aunt Rose brings the issue to a head. Rose was the name of Tennessee Williams' sister. Elia Kazan's controversial 1956 film Baby Doll was based on this play and 27 Wagons Full of Cotton, which has two similar main characters; the names Archie Lee and Baby Doll are used for the main characters in Baby Doll. =The Last of My Solid Gold Watches= The Last of My Solid Gold Watches was written in 1946, and centers on a Mississippi shoe salesman named Charlie Colton \\"whose time has passed and who pathetically echoes himself\\"; Williams is thought to have drawn on aspects of his father, a traveling salesman, in his portrait of Colton.Leverich (1995.) p. 488. =Hello from Bertha= Hello from Bertha is a 1946 one-act, about the dramatic life and death of a prostitute in a low-class bordello. It is very strong and very poetic as Bertha imagines events and allusions to her last moments. There are three characters in the play: Lena, a young prostitute who listens to Bertha, and Goldie the old lady of the house who wants to evict Bertha. A production was staged by Producer, William T. Gardner, in the summer of 1973 at the Academy Playhouse, Lake Forest, Illinois Directed by José Quintero =Lord Byron's Love Letter= Written in 1946, Lord Byron's Love Letter takes place in New Orleans in the late 19th century during Mardi Gras. A Spinster and an Old Woman advertise that they have one of Lord Byron's love letters (written to her grandmother). A Matron stops by to look at it and drags her partially inebriated Husband along. As the spinster reads from her grandmother's diary, it becomes apparent that the grandmother and the old woman are one and the same. According to the two women, the grandmother met Lord Byron in Greece, shortly before his death, and they had a summer filled with romance. After he died, the grandmother retired from the world and remained in complete seclusion as an honor to his memory (this does not prevent her from commenting on the spinster's every action). The Matron and her Husband aren't permitted to read the letter, only to look at it from a distance. 1950s =I Rise in Flame, Cried the Phoenix= I Rise in Flame, Cried the Phoenix presents a fictionalized version of the death of English writer D. H. Lawrence on the French Riveria; Lawrence was one of Williams' chief literary influences.Williams (2000.) p. 288. The play was completed in 1941, but was not published until 1951, when New Directions Publishers released it in a limited edition.Williams (2000.) p. 1030. https://tnabughawr.blogspot.in/2016/09/i-rise-in-flames-cried- phoenix.html?spref=fb&m;=1 =Talk to Me Like the Rain and Let Me Listen= Talk to Me Like the Rain and Let Me Listen was written in 1953 as part of a series of one-acts Williams wrote in particular for community theatre. Unlike the large scenic demands of his larger works (i.e. A Streetcar Named Desire) Talk Like The Rain... features a small-scale, bare-room situation. It involves an unnamed Man and Woman who are bound together in an endless cycle by their hopeless poverty. Major William's themes are explored in the Man's alcoholism and the Woman's desperation. Although not specified, the one-act can be worked in a more surrealist fashion. Monologues for both sexes, with the Woman's being substantially longer, spanning several pages. =The Dark Room= The Dark Room was written in c. 1939, and published in 1958. =The Case of the Crushed Petunias= The Case of the Crushed Petunias was written in 1941 and is the story of Dorothy Simple, a woman trapped in her job at a prim and proper shop in Massachusetts. Her complacent existence is interrupted by a visit from a tall man who works for LIFE Inc. who, she discovers, trampled her petunias the night before. With offers of poetry and packets of seeds, he helps her break free from her dreary life. =A Perfect Analysis Given by a Parrot= A Perfect Analysis Given by a Parrot was written in 1958. =Suddenly Last Summer= Suddenly Last Summer was written in New York in 1957 and debuted as part of a double bill of one-act plays by Williams, titled Garden District. [23] Williams, Tennessee. Plays 1957–1980. Mel Gussow and Kenneth Holditch, eds. New York: Library of America, 2000, p. 973 (The other one-act play was Something Unspoken.) Garden District premiered Off-Broadway at the York Playhouse on January 7, 1958. =Something Unspoken= Something Unspoken was written in London in 1951 and debuted as part of a double bill of one-act plays by Williams, titled Garden District. [24] Devlin, Albert J., ed. Conversations with Tennessee Williams. Jackson, Miss.: University Press of Mississippi, 1986, p. 52 (The other one-act was Suddenly Last Summer.) Garden District premiered Off-Broadway at the York Playhouse on January 7, 1958. The title Garden District is a misnomer, because while Suddenly Last Summer takes place in the Garden District of New Orleans, Something Unspoken takes place in Meridian, Louisiana. =And Tell Sad Stories of the Deaths of Queens ...= And Tell Sad Stories of the Deaths of Queens ... (A Play in Two Scenes) was initially written in 1957 and worked on as late as 1962. It was published in 2005 by New Directions in Mister Paradise and Other One-Act Plays (NDP1007). A slightly different version was first published in Political Stages: Plays That Shaped a Century (Applause Theatre & Cinema Books, 2002). The play concerns the private life of \\"Candy\\" Delaney, a successful interior decorator and landlord who is also transgender. It was first performed by the Shakespeare Theatre Company on April 22, 2004, at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. 1960s =Slapstick Tragedy= The Mutilated The Mutilated was written in 1966, and debuted as part of a double-bill of one-act plays written by Williams titled Slapstick Tragedy (the other one-act was The Gnädiges Fräulein.) Slapstick Tragedy premiered on Broadway at the Longacre Theatre on February 22, 1966. The Gnädiges Fräulein The Gnädiges Fräulein was written in 1966, and debuted as part of a double-bill of one-act plays written by Williams titled Slapstick Tragedy (the other one-act was The Mutilated.) Slapstick Tragedy premiered on Broadway at the Longacre Theatre on February 22, 1966. =Confessional= Confessional was written in 1967 and published in 1969 in the Williams anthology Dragon Country. It is set in a seedy bar in Southern California and centers on the confessions of four of its habitués of the bar. The staging creates the sense that the characters are confessing privately to the audience rather than to each other. The play premiered in July 1971 at the Maine Theatre Arts Festival in Bar Harbor in a double bill with Williams's I Can't Imagine Tomorrow. Williams later expanded Confessional to a two-act play Small Craft Warnings which premiered in 1972. Confessional was revived in 2016 for its British premiere at London's Southwark Playhouse.Kolin, Philip C. (2004). The Tennessee Williams Encyclopedia, p. 46. Greenwood Press. Heintzelman, Greta and Howard, Alycia Smith (2014). Critical Companion to Tennessee Williams, p. 71. Infobase Publishing. Bennion, Chris (8 October 2016). \\"Confessional is a Tennessee Williams play that should have been left to the academics\\". Daily Telegraph =Now the Cats with Jewelled Claws= Now the Cats with Jewelled Claws was written in 1969. Set in the anteroom of Hell, it was described by Williams biographer Donald Spoto as \\"gruesome....a tale of madness, depravity and death.\\"Spoto (1985). p. 353. 1970s =I Can't Imagine Tomorrow= I Can't Imagine Tomorrow was a two- character play written for television, broadcast with Talk To Me Like The Rain And Let Me Listen under the collective title \\"Dragon Country\\" on WNET-TV in 1970. Kim Stanley plays a lonely but spirited spinster being courted by a pathologically shy teacher, played by William Redfield. \\"Dragon Country\\" is available on DVD as part of the Broadway Theatre Archive. =The Frosted Glass Coffin= Written in 1970, The Frosted Glass Coffin follows a group of retirees living at a hotel in Miami, Florida. In his memoirs, Williams wrote that he believed the \\"rather depressing\\" work to be \\"one of [his] best short plays.\\"Williams (1975). p. 150. =The Demolition Downtown= The Demolition Downtown was written in 1970. =A Lovely Sunday for Creve Coeur= Written in 1976, A Lovely Sunday for Creve Coeur introduces Bodey, a hard-of-hearing 50-something, sharing her flat with Dorothea, 'Dottie', a Blanche DuBois-like 40-something civics teacher, smitten with the social-climbing principal of the school where she works, having already been taken advantage in the back seat of his car. =Kirche, Küche und Kinder= Kirche, Küche und Kinder was written in 1979. The title translates as \\"Church, Kitchen and Children\\" and is a reference to a well-known German slogan. It was first performed by The Jean Cocteau Repertory Company as a work-in-progress in September, 1979, at the Bouwerie Lane Theatre in New York City, where it ran in repertory until January, 1980. The play is subtitled (An Outrage for the Stage). It was published in 2008 by New Directions in The Traveling Companion & Other Plays (NDP1106). =Lifeboat Drill= Lifeboat Drill was written in 1979. 1980s one-acts =The Chalky White Substance= The Chalky White Substance was written in 1980.

Biography Born in Modena, Pietro Abbati descended from a 16th-century noble family who were related to the Marescotti local family. In acknowledgment of his mathematical and artistic distinction, and in return for his services managing the water and street systems of Modena, Abbati was permitted in 1818 to add the name Marescotti to his own surname. He was born in Modena and received a superior education in mathematics at the university there, studying with Luigi Fantini, Paolo Cassiani and Giovan Battista Venturi. In an 1802 letter to his friend Paolo Ruffini, Abbati extended the proof to the unsolvability of equations of degree greater than five. In 1807 he was named as an advisor to Francis IV, Duke of Modena. Three years later, he became ministry of state economics and education, with particular responsibility for waterworks and streets. In 1824 he published On a problem of Daniel Bernoulli and Lagrange. In 1826 he was named a member of the Accademia nazionale delle scienze detta dei XL (\\"National Association of the Sciences\\", also known as \\"Academy of the Forty\\"), a learned society composed of forty eminent Italian scientists.  Mathematics  He was friends with Paolo Ruffini his entire life, and engaged in mathematical research with him (although without any official recognition), especially in the areas of algebraic equations, probability, and group theory. Indeed, it appears that Abbati suggested the idea of group theory to Ruffini, who subsequently expanded it. Abbati's investigations and exchanges with Ruffini also examined diophantine equations, prime numbers, the specification of the number of imaginary roots as compared with the results of P. Paoli, the relation among the roots and the coefficients of an equation, the Cartesian rule for incomplete equations, the properties of permutations of the roots of quartic and quintic equations, the equation of differences, rational functions of roots, resolution by approximation and the related Lagrange multipliers. The thirty letters which Abbati wrote to Ruffini are now housed in the Ruffini Archive of the Biblioteca Estense in Modena. All the letters remain unpublished except one published by E. Bortolotti in an edition of Ruffini's correspondence.

It has served as something of a signature tune for the artist and recounts her feelings of grief in the years following the death of country rock star and mentor Gram Parsons. Early in her career, Harris toured with Gram Parsons and sang on his two solo albums GP and the posthumously released Grievous Angel. The song is known for its chorus \\"I would rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham/I would hold my life in his saving grace/I would walk all the way from Boulder to Birmingham/If I thought I could see, I could see your face.\\" Harris did not write again about Parsons' death in such a direct way until \\"The Road\\", a track from her 2011 album Hard Bargain. Bill Danoff recorded the song with his group, the Starland Vocal Band, on their self-titled debut album. A version of the song was a hit in New Zealand for The Hollies, reaching number ten there, and later appeared on their album A Crazy Steal. A version was recorded in 1975 by Scott Walker and The Walker Brothers on their No Regrets album. In 2012, American alternative rock band, The Fray, released a cover of the song featuring Harris as a bonus track on their record, Scars & Stories.  Cover versions  Dolly Parton included a cover on the song on her 1976 All I Can Do album. Joan Baez cut a live version of the song and it originally appeared on her 1976 live album From Every Stage; the track later appeared in the compilation Joan Baez: The Complete A&M; Recordings (released September 23, 2003). The song also appeared in a 1984 episode of The Dukes of Hazzard titled \\"Play It Again, Luke\\" in which it was sung by actor Tom Wopat as Luke and guest star Roberta Leighton as country singer and a former flame of Luke's named Candy Dix.

Musical career =House of Krazees (1992-1997, 2013-present)= Methric started his musical career in 1992 as an original member of House of Krazees under the pseudonym Hektic. Along with Mr. Bones and The R.O.C., the original House of Krazees released five albums between 1993 and 1996. Problems with the group's label, Latnem Entertainment, led House of Krazees to leave the label, and the group disbanded after its 1996 album Head Trauma. However, they reunited on the song \\"Monstrosity\\" off of Twiztid's A New Nightmare EP in 2013 and they plan on releasing new music in 2018 =Solo career (2004-present)= In 2004, Methric released his first solo LP called Chainsmoker LP. =Twiztid (1997–present)= After receiving an offer from Insane Clown Posse to join Psychopathic Records in 1997, Spaniolo and Methric accepted and reemerged as Twiztid. Upon signing with the label, the duo revamped their image, and set out to prove themselves to the Juggalo fanbase. Twiztid opened shows for Insane Clown Posse, most of the time receiving boos from the crowds and occasionally getting into fights with them. In 1997, Twiztid's debut album, Mostasteless, was released. With the release, a shift in reaction toward Twiztid occurred, and Juggalos slowly began to receive the duo well. Twiztid, however, continued to open for Insane Clown Posse and appear with them at in-store tours, improving their rapport with the fanbase. In 1999, Insane Clown Posse persuaded Island Records to sign Twiztid. During Twiztid's brief stint with the label, Mostasteless was pulled from shelves and re-released under Island Records. The following year, the duo went back to Psychopathic Records and released Freek Show. Freek Show debuted at #51 on Billboard charts, and Twiztid's fan base grew immensely. Twiztid has remained with Psychopathic Records until 2012 with the formation of Majik Ninja Entertainment. They have helped to sign artists Blaze Ya Dead Homie, Young Wicked and The R.O.C among others to the new label. The duo's 2009 album, W.I.C.K.E.D., peaked at #11 on the Billboard 200. With the position, Spaniolo says that \\"it shows relevance. It shows that [we're] not just a sideshow act. It shows that we're not just protoges, we're not just coattail riders. We are here.\\" On December 12 it was announced via Twiztid's official Twitter that Twiztid has left Psychopathic Records. =Dark Lotus (1999-2017)= Formed in 1999, Dark Lotus consists of Joseph Bruce and Joseph Utsler of Insane Clown Posse, Jamie Spaniolo and Paul Methric of Twiztid, and Chris Rouleau. Each member is said to \\"act as a 'petal' of the lotus,\\" and it was announced that there would be six members. After switching between two different \\"sixth members,\\" Marz and Anybody Killa, Dark Lotus decided to keep the group to only five. =Psychopathic Rydas (1999-2017)= Psychopathic Rydas formed in 1999, and consists of Psychopathic Records-associated rappers performing under alternate stage names in the style of mainstream gangsta rap. The group's lineup consisted of Bruce (Bullet), Utsler (Full Clip), Methric (Foe Foe), Spaniolo (Lil' Shank), Rouleau (Cell Block) and David Hutto (Yung Dirt). Although, Twiztid has left Psychopathic, they are still a part of the Rydas. Psychopathic Rydas reuses the beats of popular rappers within the genre without paying to license the original songs or requesting permission from copyright owners to use the music, effectively making their albums bootlegsInsane Clown Posse (1999). The Amazing Jeckel Brothers. Liner notes. Island/Psychopathic. and resulting in the releases becoming difficult to find in some markets. Style and influences Methric's interests in both horror movies and tobacco has had a major influence on his music. In an interview with psychopathictraders.com Methric credited the music of Tupac Shakur as a very heavy influence in his music with his favorite tupac album being Me Against The World. Spaniolo describes the work of Twiztid \\"as if there was a Halloween or Friday the 13th on wax and Jason and Michael Myers could actually rap.\\" Methric's stage name is an allusion to the carbon monoxide that comes from cigarettes. The title of his solo album, Chainsmoker LP, is taken from the practice of chain smoking. Wrestling career =Beginning (1999)= In 1999, Insane Clown Posse began a stint in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). The duo brought Spaniolo and Methric along with them to shows backstage, being fans of wrestling themselves. After Insane Clown Posse left the WWF, they started a wrestling tour called the \\"Hellfire Wrestling\\" tour. Again, both Spaniolo and Methric were brought along backstage. =Professional wrestling (1999-2003)= On December 19, 1999, both Spaniolo and Methric participated in the first \\"Juggalo Championshit Wrestling\\" event. As Jamie Madrox and Monoxide Child, they were featured in a 20-man battle royal to crown the first JCW Heavyweight Champion, which was won by Evil Dead. Spaniolo and Methric continued to sporadically wrestle for JCW until 2003. Both are untrained and have had several wrestlers show them moves backstage at shows. When asked in a 2009 interview if they were planning on returning to wrestling, Spaniolo replied, \\"No, we're not wrestlers. Every time we step into the ring, something bad happens. Either somebody gets hurt, or we get hurt ... There are things in life that you're good at, and not good at. [We're] not good at [wrestling].\\" He added that they will stick to simply watching wrestling. Personal life Along with Spaniolo, Methric is a fan of horror movies. As children, the two often watched The Evil Dead. Methric also enjoys the use of supernatural styles in films. He himself has an interest in getting into acting as well, and currently has gigs booked as typecasted and background characters. Methric is also an avid fan of both video games and tobacco. He plays Xbox 360 online with the gamertag \\"infamousballer,\\" and has cited Madden NFL 10 as one of his favorite games. Twiztid's internet radio show for WFKO is called Ashtrays and Action Figures, alluding to Methric's love of cigarettes and Spaniolo's passion for collector items and memorabilia. Methric is a fan of professional wrestling. He is a playable character in Eidos Interactive's video game Backyard Wrestling: Don't Try This at Home as Monoxide Child.

He was born the son of John Rempston at Rempstone, Nottinghamshire, where the family had long been settled. In 1381 he was Knight of the Shire for Nottinghamshire, which he also represented in the parliaments of 1382, 1393, and 1395 and served as Sheriff of Nottinghamshire for 1393. In 1398 he adopted the cause of Henry, Earl of Derby, who had been exiled by Richard II, and in the following year made his way to France to join the earl. He was one of the fifteen lances who embarked with Henry at Boulogne and landed at Ravenspur in July 1399. In Shakespeare's Richard II (act ii. scene i. 298) his name is given as Sir John Ramston, probably to suit the metre. On 7 Oct. he was appointed Constable of the Tower, and in this capacity had custody of Richard II; he was present at Richard's abdication, and was one of the witnesses to the form of resignation signed by the king. In February 1400 he was on a commission to inquire into treasons in London and the neighbourhood, and shortly after was appointed admiral of the fleet from the Thames eastwards; in August he was made a knight of the Garter, and about the same time steward of the king's household. In 1401 he was made admiral of the fleet from the Thames westwards, and was placed on a commission to deal with infractions of the truce with France, and to settle the question of the still unpaid ransom of the late King John. He was summoned to the great council held in that year. In December 1402 he was negotiating with the Duke of Orleans, and, after prolonged negotiations, concluded a treaty with the French at Lůllingen on 17 June 1403. In 1404-5 he was made a member of the privy council, and was recommended by parliament to Henry IV as one of those whose services merited special recognition; in the same year he was employed on a mission to the Duke of Burgundy. Early in 1406 he was captured by French pirates while crossing the Thames from Queenborough to Essex, but was soon released ; in the same year he was vice-chamberlain to the king. He was drowned in the Thames, close to the Tower, on 31 Oct. 1406. Rempston was the founder of his family's fortunes; he acquired extensive property in Nottinghamshire, including the manor of Bingham, which he made his seat. He married Margaret, daughter of Sir Simon Leeke, and widow of Sir Godfrey Foljambe; by her he had several children, including a notable son, Thomas Rempston.

Boeing 234 N245CH (left) and Boeing Vertol 107 C-FHFW (right) rest on the company pad in Aurora, Oregon. Columbia Helicopters, Incorporated (CHI) is an aircraft manufacturing and operator company based in Aurora, Oregon, United States. It is known for operating tandem rotor helicopters; in present times, exclusively the Boeing Vertol 107 and Boeing Vertol 234. These helicopters are used in stream restoration and forestry including heli-logging, aerial firefighting, oil exploration, construction, government support, film production, disaster response and many other activities. In addition the company operates a large FAA repair station supporting customers around the world. History =Founding and early days= Columbia Helicopters was founded on April 24, 1957 by Wes Lematta with a single Hiller 12B helicopter. With help from his brothers, he supported his young company with many odd jobs ranging from carrying Santa Claus to trapeze acts. He performed most of his flying on the weekends while still working as a truck driver during the week. Lematta gained great notoriety on September 15, 1957 by rescuing 15 sailors from a sinking dredge near Coos Bay, Oregon. For his heroic actions the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers awarded him the Army Air Medal. =Direct Visual Observational Control= After purchasing the more powerful Hiller 12E, Lematta began to operate more lift jobs. One of these large jobs was working on the John Day Dam on his company's namesake, the Columbia River. Here Lematta began performing precision lift jobs by using a longer than average cable. The concept was that the pilot could lean out the side of the aircraft and see directly where the load would be placed. A few years later, Wes' brother Jim was flying a Sikorsky S-61 in the Colorado Rockies. He was so cold he was forced to land. To fill the need for an enclosed cockpit, Columbia developed the first pilot bubble window. =\\"First in Heli-Logging\\"= Jack Erickson, of Erickson Air-Crane fame, and Lematta were able to demonstrate the first financially successful run of helicopter logging, or \\"heli-logging\\", in 1971. This was done with Lematta's Sikorsky S-61, registration number N318Y, on a U.S. Forest Service log sale near Taylorsville, California in the Plumas National Forest. The following year the 107s were used. Since the project used Lematta's helicopter and Erickson had purchased the timber, both Columbia Helicopters and Erikson Air-Crane claim to be the first successful \\"heli-loggers\\". Another unusual feat was pulling a hoverbarge on snow, ice and water in 1982.\\"Happy birthday to Columbia Helicopters!

The film had two sequels: The Further Adventures of the Wilderness Family (1978, also known as Wilderness Family Part 2) and Mountain Family Robinson (1979). The filming location was the Gunnison National Forest in the state of Colorado. Plot Skip Robinson is a construction worker who lives with his family in Los Angeles, California. Concerned about his daughter's health and the welfare of his family, as well as despising his job, Skip grows tired of the city life and decides to move his family to the Rocky Mountains with no plans to ever return due to the smog and congestion. After moving his wife Pat and two children, eleven-year-old Jennifer and seven-year-old Toby to the wilderness and then building their own cabin near a large lake, they settle in to find out that their new environment isn't always as peaceful as it may appear. From the start, the Robinson family seemed to be adjusting to their new life in the Colorado wilderness. A few days after finishing building their new cabin, Toby and Skip go out hunting one morning with their dog Kress, and succeed in catching a grouse for the family dinner. Later that day, while climbing along the rocky slopes of a large hill, Skip and his son almost get caught in a deadly landslide. They later find a pair of young grizzly bear cubs who have lost their mother to the same landslide they got caught in. The cubs are quickly adopted into the Robinson family, but Pat and Skip tell their children that sooner or later the cubs would have to be released back into the wild when they are fully grown. During the next few weeks, the Robinson family slowly adapt to their new life in the mountains. In addition to the two young bear cubs and their family dog, Skip and his family also befriend a raccoon that they find living near their cabin and name him Bandito. While Jenny and Toby are collecting flowers, they encounter cougar cubs near their den. The family receive numerous letters and packages from friends and family back in Los Angeles. Pat receives several letters from her mother and Jenny and Toby are given numerous schoolbooks from the Los Angeles schoolboard. Skip continues hunting for small game and fishing in the nearest creek to provide food for his family, while his wife works around the house and their two children work on their schoolwork. One day, while fishing for some trout down by the creek with the two grizzly cubs, Skip and the cubs are scared by a large black bear that was roaming along the creekbed. Jenny and Toby had gone out for a walk with their dog Kress, to which they later encounter the same bear that their dad saw down by the creek. While Toby heads back to the cabin to get his parents, Jenny goes after Kress, who has managed to scare the bear away. Skip is informed by Toby of what happened, and he heads out with his rifle to find his daughter. While trying to find their way back to the cabin, Jenny and Kress are attacked by a pack of gray wolves who chase them down to a nearby lake and almost attack Jenny. Kress is able to fend the wolves off long enough for Skip to arrive in the nick of time and drive the pack away. Despite this frightening encounter, Jenny quickly recovers from the shock of what had happened and is brought home safe and sound. The next day, Skip and his family meet a friendly aging mountain man who introduces himself as Boomer. Boomer informs them that he had been a longtime partner and friend to Ol' Jake, Skip's uncle who lived in the same area where the Robinsons had built their cabin. Ol' Jake had been known to take extremely good care of the local wildlife in the area, including a friendly black bear named Samson he raised from a cub to a massive adult that was the same black bear that Skip and his family had encountered a few times before. Boomer also warns Skip and his family to keep a watchful eye for Three-Toes, a locally notorious grizzly bear that has been known to invade the properties of humans who are living in the mountains. Boomer is then forced to leave when the two bear cubs accidentally frighten away Boomer's mule Flora. Later on, while the family was out gathering a large bear walks into their cabin. Seeing it's a black bear, the children decide it must be Samson. Taking a risk, Skip follows Boomer's advice and \\"introduces himself\\". Thankfully it pays off and the bear, who turns out to be Samson, befriends the family and joins them for dinner. The family settles in further to their new life, gathering from the surrounding forests and spending time with their new animal friends and Boomer. One day, while Pat and Jenny are picking berries, they encounter Three-Toes; Kress manages to fend off Three-Toes while Pat retrieves Jenny, who suffered a massive shock. Skip goes to find Kress while tracking down Three-Toes. The following morning, Jenny's condition has gotten worse, Skip tries to call for help but the radio's batteries are dead, so he has to walk to get help. During a windstorm, Three-Toes tries to break into the cabin, but Pat tries to fend him off. Samson comes to the family's defence and engages Three-Toes in a brawl as Pat reloads the gun. Samson manages to hold the grizzly off long enough and Pat manages to shoot Three-Toes, killing him. Skip returns with a doctor, saying that Jenny's health is improving. Pat is still hesitant about staying but she agrees to adapt as this is a better life for her and her family. Boomer then shows up and comically loses his animal again, and the children run off to help him. Main cast *Robert Logan ... Skip Robinson *Susan Damante-Shaw ... Pat Robinson *Hollye Holmes ...

Liszt's intent, according to musicologist Hugh MacDonald, was for these single-movement works \\"to display the traditional logic of symphonic thought.\\" In other words, Liszt wanted these works to display a complexity in their interplay of themes similar to that usually reserved for the opening movement of the Classical symphony; this principal self-contained section was normally considered the most important in the larger whole of the symphony in terms of academic achievement and musical architecture. At the same time, Liszt wanted to incorporate the abilities of program music to inspire listeners to imagine scenes, images, or moods. To capture these dramatic and evocative qualities while achieving the scale of an opening movement, he combined elements of overture and symphony in a modified sonata design. The composition of the symphonic poems proved daunting. They underwent a continual process of creative experimentation that included many stages of composition, rehearsal and revision to reach a balance of musical form. Aware that the public appreciated instrumental music with context, Liszt provided written prefaces for nine of his symphonic poems. However, Liszt's view of the symphonic poem tended to be evocative, using music to create a general mood or atmosphere rather than to illustrate a narrative or describe something literally. In this regard, Liszt authority Humphrey Searle suggests that he may have been closer to his contemporary Hector Berlioz than to many who would follow him in writing symphonic poems.Searle, Orchestral, 283. Background Goethe and Schiller in front of the Deutsches Nationaltheater and Staatskapelle Weimar, where many of Liszt's symphonic poems premiered.Walker, Weimar, 301-302. According to cultural historian Hannu Salmi, classical music began to gain public prominence in Western Europe in the latter 18th century through the establishment of concerts by musical societies in cities such as Leipzig and the subsequent press coverage of these events.Salmi, 50. This was a consequence of the Industrial Revolution, according to music critic and historian Harold C. Schonberg, which brought changes to the early 19th-century lifestyles of the working masses. The lower and middle classes began to take an interest in the arts, which previously had been enjoyed mostly by the clergy and aristocracy.Schonberg, Conductors, 68. In the 1830s, concert halls were few, and orchestras served mainly in the production of operas--symphonic works were considered far lower in importance.Schonberg, Conductiors, 68. However, the European music scene underwent a transformation in the 1840s. As the role of religion diminished, Salmi asserts, 19th-century culture remained a religious one and the attendance of the arts in historical or similarly impressive surroundings \\"may still have generated a rapture akin to experiencing the sacred.\\"Salmi, 54. Schonberg, cultural historian Peter Cay and musicologist Alan Walker add that, while aristocrats still held private musical events, public concerts grew as institutions for the middle class, which was growing prosperous and could now afford to attend.Cay, 229; Schonberg, Conductors, 69; Walker, Weimar, 306. As interest burgeoned, these concerts were performed at a rapidly increasing number of venues.Bonds, New Grove (2001), 24:834; Cay, 229. Programs often ran over three hours, \\"even if the content was thin: two or more symphonies, two overtures, vocal and instrumental numbers, duets, a concerto.\\" Roughly half of the presented music was vocal in nature.Schonberg, Conductors, 70. Symphonies by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Joseph Haydn or Ludwig van Beethoven usually opened or concluded concerts, and \\"while these works were revered as models of great music, they were ultimately less popular than the arias and scenes from operas and oratorios that stood prominently in the middle of these concerts.\\"Weber, New Grove (2001), 6:227. Meanwhile, the future of the symphony genre was coming into doubt. Musicologist Mark Evan Bonds writes, \\"Even symphonies by [such] well-known composers of the early 19th century as Méhul, Rossini, Cherubini, Hérold, Czerny, Clementi, Weber and Moscheles were perceived in their own time as standing in the symphonic shadow of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, or some combination of the three.\\"Bonds, New Grove (2001), 24:836. While many composers continued to write symphonies during the 1820s and 30s, \\"there was a growing sense that these works were aesthetically far inferior to Beethoven's.... The real question was not so much whether symphonies could still be written, but whether the genre could continue to flourish and grow as it had over the previous half-century in the hands of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. On this count, there were varying degrees of skepticism but virtually no real optimism.\\"Bonds, New Grove (2001), 24:837. The crux of the issue, Bonds asserts, \\"was never really one of style ... but rather of generic conception.\\" Between his Third and Seventh Symphonies, Beethoven had pushed the symphony well beyond the boundaries of entertainment into those of moral, political and philosophical statement. By adding text and voices in his Ninth Symphony, he not only redefined the genre but also called into question whether instrumental music could truly be superior to vocal music. The Ninth, Bonds says, in fact became the catalyst that fueled debate about the symphony genre. Hector Berlioz was the only composer \\"able to grapple successfully with Beethoven's legacy.\\" However, Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann and Niels Gade also achieved successes with their symphonies, putting at least a temporary stop to the debate as to whether the genre was dead.Bonds, New Grove (2001), 24:838. Regardless, composers increasingly turned to the \\"more compact form\\" of the concert overture \\"as a vehicle within which to blend musical, narrative and pictoral ideas\\"; examples included Mendelssohn's overtures A Midsummer Night's Dream (1826) and The Hebrides (1830). The Altenburg, Liszt's residence in Weimar (1848-1861), where he wrote the first 12 of his symphonic poems. Franz Liszt, a Hungarian composer, had attempted to write a Revolutionary Symphony as early as 1830; however, his focus for the early part of his adult life was mostly on his performing career. By 1847, Liszt was famous throughout Europe as a virtuoso pianist.Walker, Weimar, 6. \\"Lisztomania\\" swept across Europe, the emotional charge of his recitals making them \\"more like séances than serious musical events\\", and the reaction of many of his listeners could be characterized as hysterical.Walker, Virtuoso, 289. Musicologist Alan Walker says, \\"Liszt was a natural phenomenon, and people were swayed by him.... With his mesmeric personality and long mane of flowing hair, he created a striking stage presence. And there were many witnesses to testify that his playing did indeed raise the mood of an audience to a level of mystical ecstasy.\\" The demands of concert life \\"reached exponential proportions\\" and \\"every public appearance led to demands for a dozen others.\\" Liszt desired to compose music, such as large-scale orchestral works, but lacked the time to do so as a travelling virtuoso. In September 1847, Liszt gave his last public recital as a paid artist and announced his retirement from the concert platform.Walker, Virtuoso, 442. He settled in Weimar, where he had been made its honorary music director in 1842, to work on his compositions. Weimar was a small town that held many attractions for Liszt. Two of Germany's greatest men of letters, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller, had both lived there. As one of the cultural centers of Germany, Weimar boasted a theater and an orchestra plus its own painters, poets and scientists. The University of Jena was also nearby. Most importantly, the town's patroness was the Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna, the sister of Tsar Nicholas I of Russia. \\"This triple alliance of court, theater and academia was difficult to resist.\\" The town also received its first railway line in 1848, which gave Liszt relatively quick access from there to the rest of Germany. Inventing the symphonic poem Liszt desired to expand single-movement works beyond the concert overture form. As he himself said, \\"New wine demands new bottles,\\"As quoted in Walker, New Grove (2000), 14:772 and Weimar, 309. and as Alan Walker points out, the \\"language of music was changing; it seemed pointless to Liszt to contain it in forms that were almost 100 years old.\\"Walker, New Grove (2000), 14:772. The music of overtures is to inspire listeners to imagine scenes, images, or moods; Liszt intended to combine those programmatic qualities with a scale and musical complexity normally reserved for the opening movement of Classical symphonies.Spencer, P., 1233. The opening movement, with its interplay of contrasting themes under sonata form, was normally considered the most important part of the symphony.Larue and Wolf, New Grove (2001), 24:814-815. To achieve his objectives, he needed a more flexible method of developing musical themes than sonata form would allow, but one that would preserve the overall unity of a musical composition.Searle, New Grove (1980), 11:41.Searle, Works, 61. According to musicologist Norman Demuth and others, César Franck wrote the first symphonic poem. Liszt found his method through two compositional practices, which he used in his symphonic poems. The first practice was cyclic form, a procedure established by Beethoven in which certain movements are not only linked but actually reflect one another's content. Liszt took Beethoven's practice one step further, combining separate movements into a single-movement cyclic structure.Searle, \\"Orchestral Works\\", 281. Many of Liszt's mature works follow this pattern, of which Les préludes is one of the best-known examples. The second practice was thematic transformation, a type of variation in which one theme is changed, not into a related or subsidiary theme but into something new, separate and independent. Thematic transformation, like cyclic form, was nothing new in itself; it had already been used by Mozart and Haydn.MacDonald, New Grove (1980), 19:117. In the final movement of his Ninth Symphony, Beethoven had transformed the theme of the \\"Ode to Joy\\" into a Turkish march.Walker, Weimar, 310. Weber and Berlioz had also transformed themes, and Schubert used thematic transformation to bind together the movements of his Wanderer Fantasy, a work that had a tremendous influence on Liszt.Searle, Music, 60-61. However, Liszt perfected the creation of significantly longer formal structures solely through thematic transformation, not only in the symphonic poems but in other works such as his Second Piano Concerto and his Piano Sonata in B minor. In fact, when a work had to be shortened, Liszt tended to cut sections of conventional musical development and preserve sections of thematic transformation.Walker, Weimar, 323 footnote 37. Between 1845 and 1847, Belgian-French composer César Franck wrote an orchestral piece based on Victor Hugo's poem Ce qu'on entend sur la montagne. The work exhibits characteristics of a symphonic poem, and some musicologists, such as Norman Demuth and Julien Tiersot, consider it the first of its genre, preceding Liszt's compositions.Ulrich, 228.Murray, 214. However, Franck did not publish or perform his piece; neither did he set about defining the genre. Liszt's determination to explore and promote the symphonic poem gained him recognition as the genre's inventor.MacDonald, New Grove (2001), 24:802, 804; Trevitt and Fauquet, New Grove (2001), 9:178, 182. Until he coined the term \\"symphonic poem\\", Liszt introduced several of these new orchestral works as overtures; in fact, some of the poems were initially overtures or preludes for other works, only later being expanded or rewritten past the confines of the overture form.Shulstad, 206-7. The first version of Tasso, Liszt stated, was an incidental overture for Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's 1790 drama Torquato Tasso, performed for the Weimar Goethe Centenary Festival.Shulstad, 207. Orpheus was first performed in Weimar on 16 February 1854 as a prelude to Christoph Willibald Gluck's opera Orfeo ed Euridice.Shulstad, 208. Likewise, Hamlet started out in 1858 as a prelude to the Shakespearean tragedy.Searle, \\"Orchestral Works\\", 298. Liszt first used the term \\"Symphonische Dichtung\\" (symphonic poem) in public at a concert in Weimar on 23 February 1854 to describe Les préludes. Later he used the term \\"poèmes symphoniques\\" in a letter to Hans von Bülow to describe Les préludes and Orpheus. Composition process Particularly striking in his symphonic poems is Liszt's approach to musical form.Walker, Weimar, 308. As purely musical structures, they do not follow a strict presentation and development of musical themes as they would under sonata form. Instead, they follow a loose episodic pattern, in which motifs--recurring melodies associated with a subject--are thematically transformed in a manner similar to that later made famous by Richard Wagner.MacDonald, New Grove (1980), 18:429. Recapitulations, where themes are normally restated after they are combined and contrasted in development, are foreshortened, while codas, where pieces of music generally wind to a close, are greatly enlarged to a size and scope that can affect the listener's concept of the themes.Walker, Weimar, 309. Themes shuffle into new and unexpected patterns of order, and three- or four-movement structures roll into one in a continual process of creative experimentation.Walker, Weimar, 304. Liszt conducting. \\"I needed to hear [my works]\\", he would write, \\"in order to get an idea of them.\\" Part of this creative experimentation was a trial-and- error approach. Liszt constructed compositions with varying sections of music not necessarily having distinct beginnings and ends.Mueller, 329, 331f. He sketched sections, sometimes without fully completing them, on a small number of staves with some indication of the orchestration.Walker, Weimar, 199.Searle, Music, 68. After an assistant--August Conradi from 1848 to 1849, Joachim Raff from 1850 to 1853--had realized Liszt's ideas and provided a score of an acceptable standard,Searle, Music, 68-9. Liszt would then make further revisions;Walker, Weimar, 199, 203.Searle, Music, 69. he moved sections to form different structural relationships, and modified connective materials or composed them anew, completing the piece of music. The score was copied, then tried out in rehearsals with the Weimarian Court orchestra and further changes made in the light of practical experience.Walker, New Grove (2001), 14:772. Many years later, Liszt reminisced how his compositional development hinged on hearing an orchestra perform his works: \\"I needed to hear them in order to get an idea of them.\\" He added that it was much more for this reason, and not simply for securing a public for his own works, that he promoted them in Weimar and elsewhere. After many such stages of composition, rehearsal and revision, Liszt might reach a version where the musical form seemed balanced and he was satisfied. However, it was his habit to write modifications to already printed scores. From his perspective, his compositions remained \\"works in progress\\" as he continued to reshape, rework, or add and subtract material. In some instances, a composition could exist in four or five versions simultaneously.Mueller, 329.Walker, Virtuoso, 306. Tasso, based on the life of sixteenth-century Italian poet, Torquato Tasso, is a perfect example of both Liszt's working method and his achievements based on restless experimentation. The 1849 version following a conventional overture layout, divided into a slow section (\\"Lament\\") and a fast one (\\"Triumph\\"). Even with this division, the entire work was actually a set of variations on a single melody—a folk hymn sung to Liszt by a gondolier in Venice in the late 1830s.Searle, \\"Orchestral Works\\", 287. Among the most significant revisions Liszt made was the addition of a middle section in the vein of a minuet. The theme of the minuet was, again, a variant of the gondolier's folk hymn, thus becoming another example of thematic transformation. Calmer than either of the outer sections, it was intended to depict Tasso's more stable years in the employment of the Este family in Ferrara.Searle, \\"Orchestral Works\\", 288. In a margin note, Liszt informs the conductor that the orchestra \\"assumes a dual role\\" in this section; strings play a self-contained piece based on the original version of the gondolier's hymn while woodwinds play another based on the variation used in the minuet. This was very much in the manner of Italian composer Pietro Raimondi, whose contrapuntal mastery was such that he had written three oratorios--Joseph, Potiphar and Jacob--which could be performed either individually or together. Liszt made a study of Raimondi's work but the Italian composer died before Liszt could meet him personally.Walker, Weimar, 317, 319. While the minuet section was probably added to act as a musical bridge between the opening lament and final triumphal sections,Searle, New Grove (1980), 11:42. it along with other modifications \\"rendered the 'Tasso Overture' an overture no longer\\". The piece became \\"far too long and developed\\" to be considered an overture and was redesignated a symphonic poem. Raff's role When Liszt started writing symphonic poems, \\"he had very little experience in handling an orchestra ... his knowledge of the technique of instrumentation was defective and he had as yet composed hardly anything for the orchestra.\\" For these reasons he relied first on his assistants August Conradi and Joachim Raff to fill the gaps in his knowledge and find his \\"orchestral voice\\". Raff, \\"a gifted composer with an imaginative grasp of the orchestra\\", offered close assistance to Liszt. Also helpful were the virtuosi present at that time in the Weimarian Court orchestra, such as trombonist Moritz Nabich, harpist Jeanne Pohl, concertmaster Joseph Joachim and violinist Edmund Singer. \\"[Liszt] mixed daily with these musicians, and their discussions must have been filled with 'shop talk.'\\" Both Singer and cellist Bernhard Cossmann were widely experienced orchestral players who probably knew the different instrumental effects a string section could produce--knowledge that Liszt would have found invaluable, and about which he might have had many discussions with the two men.Walker, Weimar, 316-317. With such a range of talent from which to learn, Liszt may have actually mastered orchestration reasonably quickly. By 1853, he felt he no longer needed Raff's assistance and their professional association ended in 1856.Walker, Weimar, 202. Also, in 1854 Liszt received a specially designed instrument called a \\"piano-organ\\" from the firm of Alexandre and fils in Paris. This huge instrument, a combination of piano and organ, was basically a one-piece orchestra that contained three keyboards, eight registers, a pedal board and a set of pipes that reproduced the sounds of all the wind instruments. With it, Liszt could try out various instrumental combinations at his leisure as a further aid for his orchestration.Walker, Weimar, 77. Joachim Raff, who made claims about his role in Liszt's compositional process. While Raff was able to offer \\"practical suggestions [in orchestration] which were of great value to Liszt\\", there may have been \\"a basic misunderstanding\\" of the nature of their collaboration. Liszt wanted to learn more about instrumentation and acknowledged Raff's greater expertise in this area. Hence, he gave Raff piano sketches to orchestrate, just as he had done earlier with Conradi--\\"so that he might rehearse them, reflect on them, and then, as his confidence in the orchestra grew, change them.\\"Walker, Weimar, 203. Raff disagreed, having the impression that Liszt wanted him on equal terms as a full collaborator. While attending an 1850 rehearsal of Prometheus, he told Bernhard Cossmann, who sat next to him, \\"Listen to the instrumentation. It is by me.\\" Raff continued making such claims about his role in Liszt's compositional process. Some of these accounts, published posthumously by Die Musik in 1902 and 1903, suggest that he was an equal collaborator with Liszt. Raff's assertions were supported by Joachim, who had been active in Weimar at approximately the same time as Raff. Walker writes that Joachim later recalled to Raff's widow \\"that he had seen Raff 'produce full orchestral scores from piano sketches.'\\" Joachim also told Raff's biographer Andreas Moser that \\"the E-flat-major Piano Concerto was orchestrated from beginning to end by Raff.\\"As quoted by Walker, Weimar, 203. Raff's and Joachim's statements effectively questioned the authorship of Liszt's orchestral music, especially the symphonic poems. This speculation was debased when composer and Liszt scholar Peter Raabe carefully compared all sketches then known of Liszt's orchestral works with the published versions of the same works.Walker, Weimar, 205. Raabe demonstrated that, regardless of the position with first drafts, or of how much assistance Liszt may have received from Raff or Conradi at that point, every note of the final versions represents Liszt's intentions. Programmatic content Liszt provided written prefaces for nine of his symphonic poems.Shulstad, 214. His doing so, Alan Walker states, \\"was a reflection of the historical position in which he found himself.\\"Walker, Weimar, 306. Liszt was aware these musical works would be experienced not just by select connoisseurs, as might have been the case in previous generations, but also by the general public. In addition, he knew about the public's fondness for attaching stories to instrumental music, regardless of their source, their relevance to a musical composition or whether the composer had actually sanctioned them. Therefore, in a pre-emptive gesture, Liszt provided context before others could invent one to take its place. Liszt may have also felt that since many of these works were written in new forms, some sort of verbal or written explanation would be welcome to explain their shape.Searle, \\"Orchestral Works\\", 283. These prefaces have proven atypical in a couple of ways. For one, they do not spell out a specific, step-by-step scenario that the music would follow but rather a general context. Some of them, in fact, are little more than autobiographical asides on what inspired Liszt to compose a piece or what feelings he was trying to inspire through it.Walker, Weimar, 306-7. While these insights could prove \\"both useful and interesting\\" in themselves, Walker admits, will they aid listeners to \\"pictorialize the music that follows?\\" For Liszt, Walker concludes, the \\"pictorialization of a detailed program is simply not an issue.\\" Moreover, Liszt wrote these prefaces long after he had composed the music. This was the complete opposite of other composers, who wrote their music to fit a pre-existing program. For both these reasons, Walker suggests, Liszt's prefaces could be called \\"programmes about music\\" with equal logic or validity. He adds that the prefaces might not have entirely been of Liszt's idea or doing, since evidence exists that his then-companion Princess Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein helped shape or create them. Overall, Walker concludes, \\"Posterity may have overestimated the importance of extra-musical thought in Liszt's symphonic poems. We would not want to be without his prefaces, of course, nor any other that he made about the origins of his music; but we should not follow them slavishly, for the simple reason that the symphonic poems do not follow them slavishly either.\\"Walker, Weimar, 307. Hugh MacDonald concurs that Liszt \\"held an idealized view of the symphonic poem\\" as being evocative rather than representational. \\"He only rarely achieved in his symphonic poems the directness and subtle timing that narrative requires,\\" MacDonald explains; he generally focused more on expressing poetic ideas by setting a mood or atmosphere, refraining on the whole from narrative description or pictorial realism. Reception Leopold Damrosch helped popularize Liszt's symphonic poems. Liszt composed his symphonic poems during a period of great debate among musicians in central Europe and Germany, known as the War of the Romantics. While Beethoven's work was admired universally, conservatives that included Johannes Brahms and members of the Leipzig Conservatory considered it unsurpassable.Walker, Weimar, 357. Liberals such as Liszt, Wagner and others of the New German School saw Beethoven's innovations as a beginning in music, not an end.Walker, Weimar, 348, 357. In this climate, Liszt had emerged as a lightning-rod for the avant-garde. Even with the innovative music being written by Wagner and Berlioz, it was Liszt, Walker says, \\"who was making all the noise and attracting the most attention\\" through his musical compositions, polemic writings, conducting and teaching.Walker, Weimar, 336.The hostility between these two groups was such that, when Bülow was invited to Leipzig to give a piano recital in 1857, he was asked to drop Liszt's B minor piano sonata from his program. \\"People have heard that you play the things of Liszt,\\" Ferdinand David wrote to Bülow. \\"Show them you that you understand no less the work of the older masters.\\" Bülow was incensed, not only for the requested change but that David had considered Liszt's work unworthy of being called a sonata (Walker, Weimar, 348). Aware of the potential for controversy, Liszt wrote, \\"The barometer is hardly set on praise for me at the moment. I expect quite a hard downpour of rain when the symphonic poems appear.\\"Quoted in Walker, 337. Joseph Joachim, who in his time in Weimar had found Liszt's workshop rehearsals and the trial-and-error process practiced in them to be wearisome, was dismayed at what he considered their lack of creativity.Walker, Weimar, 346. Vienna music critic Eduard Hanslick found even the term \\"Sinfonische Dichtung\\" contradictory and offensive; he wrote against them with vehemence after he had heard only one, Les préludes.Walker, Weimar, 363. Surgeon Theodor Billroth, who was also a musical friend of Brahms, wrote of them, \\"This morning [Brahms] and Kirchner played the Symphonic Poems (sic) of Liszt on two pianos ... music of hell, and can't even be called music--toilet paper music! I finally vetoed Liszt on medical grounds and we purged ourselves with Brahms's [piano arrangement of the] G Major String Sextet.\\"As quoted in Swafford, 307. Wagner was more receptive; he agreed with the idea of the unity of the arts that Liszt espoused and wrote as much in his \\"Open Letter on Liszt's Symphonic Poems\\".Walker, Weimar, 358. Walker considers this letter seminal in the War of the Romantics:Walker, Weimar, 358-359. > It is filled with penetrating observations about the true nature of > \\"programme music\\", about the mysterious relationship between \\"form\\" and > \\"content\\" and about the historical links that bind the symphonic poem to the > classical symphony.... The symphonic poems, Wagner assured his readers, were > first and foremost music. Their importance for history ... lay in the fact > that Liszt had discovered a way of creating his material from the potential > essence of the other arts.... Wagner's central observations are so accurate > ... that we can only assume that there had been a number of discussions > between [Liszt and Wagner] as to what exactly a \\"symphonic poem\\" really was. Such was the controversy over these works that two points were overlooked by the critics. First, Liszt's own attitude toward program music was derived from Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony, and he would have likely argued that his music, like the Pastoral, was \\"more the expression of feeling than painting.\\"Quoted in Walker, Weimar, 359. Second, more conservative composers such as Felix Mendelssohn and Brahms had also written program music. Mendelssohn's The Hebrides Overture could be considered a musical seascape based on autobiographical experience but indistinguishable in musical intent from Liszt's symphonic poems. By titling the first of his Op. 10 Ballades as \\"Edward\\", Brahms nominated it as the musical counterpart of its old Scottish saga and namesake. This was not the only time Brahms would write program music.Walker, Weimar, 359–60. Karl Klindworth, another Liszt follower who conducted the symphonic poems. Liszt's new works did not find guaranteed success in their audiences, especially in cities where listeners were accustomed to more conservative music programming. While Liszt had \\"a solid success\\" with Prometheus and Orpheus in 1855 when he conducted in Brunswick,Walker, Weimar, 265. the climate for Les Préludes and Tasso that December in Berlin was cooler.Walker, Weimar, 266-267. His performance of Mazeppa two years later in Leipzig was almost stopped due to hissing from the audience.Walker, Weimar, 296. A similar incident occurred when Hans von Bülow conducted Die Ideale in Berlin in 1859; after the performance, the conductor turned on the audience and ordered the demonstrators to leave, \\"as it is not customary to hiss in this hall.\\"Walker, Weimar, 297. Matters improved somewhat in the following decades, thanks to the efforts of Liszt disciples such as Bülow, Karl Tausig, Leopold Damrosch and Karl Klindworth. Nevertheless, audiences at the time found the compositions puzzling.Walker, Weimar, 301. The audiences may have been challenged by the works' complexity, which have also caused problems for musicians. Written in new forms, the symphonic poems used unorthodox time signatures, producing an unusual beat at times. The irregular rhythm proved difficult to play and sounded erratic to listeners. Compared to the mellower harmonies of Mozart's or Haydn's symphonies, or many operatic arias of the time, the symphonic poem's advanced harmonies could produce harsh or awkward music. Due to its use of unusual key signatures, the symphonic poem had many sharp and flat notes, more than a standard musical work. The greater number of notes posed a challenge to musicians, who have to vary the pitch of the notes in accordance with the score. The quick fluctuations in the speed of the music were another factor in the symphonic poem's complexity. The constant use of chamber-music textures, which are produced by having single players perform extended solo passages or having small groups play ensemble passages, put a stress on the orchestra; the mistakes of the solo artist or small groups would not be \\"covered up\\" by the mass sound of the orchestra and were obvious to everyone.Walker, Weimar, 270. These aspects of the symphonic poem demanded players to have superior caliber, perfect intonation, keen ears and knowledge of the roles of their orchestra members. The complexity of the symphonic poems may have been one reason that Liszt urged other conductors to \\"hold aloof\\" from the works until they were prepared to deal with the challenges. Most orchestras of small towns at that time were not capable of meeting the demands of this music.Walker, Weimar, 270-271. Contemporary orchestras also faced another challenge when playing Liszt's symphonic poems for the first time. Liszt kept his works on manuscripts, distributing them to the orchestra on his tour. Some parts of the manuscripts were so heavily corrected that players found it difficult to decipher them, let alone play them well. The symphonic poems were considered such a financial risk that orchestral parts for many of them were not published until the 1880s. Legacy With the exception of Les préludes, none of the symphonic poems have entered the standard repertoire, though critics suggest that the best of them--Prometheus, Hamlet and Orpheus-- are worth further listening. Musicologist Hugh MacDonald writes, \\"Unequal in scope and achievement though they are, they looked forward at times to more modern developments and sowed the seeds of a rich crop of music in the two succeeding generations.\\" Speaking of the genre itself, MacDonald adds that, although the symphonic poem is related to opera in its aesthetics, it effectively supplanted opera and sung music by becoming \\"the most sophisticated development of programme music in the history of the genre.\\"MacDonald, New Grove (1980), 18:428. Liszt authority Humphrey Searle essentially concurs with MacDonald, writing that Liszt \\"wished to expound philosophical and humanistic ideas which were of the greatest importance to him.\\"Searle, Music, 77. These ideas were not only connected with Liszt's personal problems as an artist, but they also coincided with explicit problems being addressed by writers and painters of the era. In developing the symphonic poem, Liszt \\"satisfied three of the principal aspirations of 19th century music: to relate music to the world outside, to integrate multi- movement forms ... and to elevate instrumental programme music to a level higher than that of opera, the genre previously regarded as the highest mode of musical expression.\\" In fulfilling these needs, the symphonic poems played a major role, widening the scope and expressive power of the advanced music of its time. According to music historian Alan Walker, \\"Their historical importance is undeniable; both Sibelius and Richard Strauss were influenced by them, and adapted and developed the genre in their own way. For all their faults, these pieces offer many examples of the pioneering spirit for which Liszt is celebrated.\\" List of works Die Hunnenschlacht, as painted by Wilhelm von Kaulbach, upon which Liszt based his symphonic poem of the same name. In chronological order from the beginning date of composition, the symphonic poems are as follows (the published numbering differs as shown):Saffle, \\"Orchestral Works\\", 238, 273, 275fn. * No. 8 Héroïde funèbre (1830–56) * No. 9 Hungaria (1830–57) * No. 6 Mazeppa, after Hugo (1838–54) * No. 2 Tasso: lamento e trionfo, after Byron (1840–54) * No. 3 Les préludes, after Lamartine (c1845–54) * No. 1 Ce qu'on entend sur la montagne, after Hugo (1845?–54) * No. 5 Prometheus (1850–55) * No. 7 Festklänge (1853–54) * No. 4 Orpheus (1854) * No. 12 Die Ideale, after Schiller (1857–58) * No. 11 Hunnenschlacht, after Kaulbach (1857–61) * No. 10 Hamlet, after Shakespeare (1858–61) * No. 13 Von der Wiege bis zum Grabe (1881–83) Related works Liszt's Faust and Dante symphonies share the same aesthetic stance as the symphonic poems; though they are multi-movement works that employ a chorus, their compositional methods and aims are alike. Two Episodes from Lenau's Faust should also be considered with the symphonic poems. The first, \\"Der nächtliche Zug\\", is closely descriptive of Faust as he watches a passing procession of pilgrims by night. The second, \\"Der Tanz in der Dorfschenke\\", which is also known as the First Mephisto Waltz, tells of Mephistopheles seizing a violin at a village dance.

It was originally a publication of the Hồ Chí Minh Communist Youth Union (Vietnamese: Đoàn Thanh niên Cộng sản Hồ Chí Minh) of Ho Chi Minh City, and while it is still the official mouthpiece of that organization, it has grown to become the largest newspaper in the country . As of 2007 its daily circulation was 450,000. The printed newspaper includes: Tuổi Trẻ daily, weekly Tuổi Trẻ Cuối Tuần, semimonthly Tuổi Trẻ Cười. Online versions includes: a Vietnamese version Tuổi Trẻ Online and an English version Tuoi Tre News. History Tuoi Tre Newspaper was officially established on September 2, 1975. However, its precursor was propaganda leaflets issued by students and pupils in Saigon during their anti-American movements in the Vietnam War. In its early stage, Tuoi Tre circulated tri- weekly. On September 1, 2000, it started to issue one more on Friday. From April 2, 2006, it became a daily newspaper. Offices Its headquarters is located on 60A, Hoàng Văn Thụ street, Ward 9, Phú Nhuận District, in the urban area of Ho Chi Minh City and not so far from Tan Son Nhat International Airport. Tuoi Tre has 8 representative offices in Hanoi at 72A Thuy Khue street (currently at 15 Doc Ngu street - Ba Dinh district while the building at Thuy Khue street is under reconstruction), Nghệ An, Huế, Đà Nẵng, Qui Nhơn, Nha Trang, Đà Lạt, and Cần Thơ. Stance Described as \\"pro-reformist\\" by the BBC, the newspaper had run into trouble with the communist authorities several times. In May 1991, its editor in chief was sacked when the paper ran an article trepidly acknowledging Ho Chi Minh's early marriage to Zeng Xueming. Ms. Vu Kim Hanh, former Tuoi Tre Newspaper's editorial direction, was dismissed for lack of serious \\"demerit\\". Mr Le Van Nuoi, who was the Ho Chi Minh City Community Assistant at that time, had to dismiss her and managed the office until he completed his term of office at Ho Chi Minh City Community. In 2000, it commissioned a survey among youths in Ho Chi Minh City which found out that Bill Gates is more admired than Ho Chi Minh. This resulted in the published copies being destroyed by state censors and the three editors harshly sanctioned. In 2005, the newspaper published a series of investigative articles about the monopolization of the pharmaceutical market by Zuellig Pharma. The reporter, Lan Anh, was subsequently disciplined and discharged. In July 2018, the government suspended the newspaper from publishing online for 3 months and fined it 220 million VND. The disciplinary action came after the newspaper published an article on June 19, 2018 quoting President Trần Đại Quang agreeing with the need for a new law regarding protests and left in place a reader's comment in another article published back on May 26, 2017 that was deemed to be \\"splitting national unity\\" by the Press Authority. The Press Authority determined that the content of the article quoting the President was \\"untrue\\" and \\"caused severe impact\\".

Kakawin Sutasoma is an Old Javanese poem in poetic metres (kakawin or kavya). It is the source of the motto of Indonesia, Bhinneka Tunggal Ika, which is usually translated as Unity in Diversity, although literally it means '(Although) in pieces, yet One'. It is not without reason that the motto was taken from this kakawin as the kakawin teaches religious tolerance, specifically between the Hindu and Buddhist religions. The Kakawin tells the epic story of Lord Sutasoma, and was written by Mpu Tantular in the 14th Century. Summary Kalmasapada Buddha-to-be (Bodhisattva) was reincarnated as Sutasoma, the son of the King of Hastinapura. As an adult, he was very pious and devout, and did not wish to be married and crowned king. So one night, Sutasoma fled from Hastinapura. When Sutasoma's absence was discovered, the palace was in tumult and the King and Queen were very sad, and were consoled by many people. When he arrived in the forest, the noble Lord Sutasoma prayed in a shrine. The Goddess Widyukarali appeared before him and told him that his prayers had been heard and would be granted. Lord Sutasoma then climbed into the Himalaya mountains in the company of several holy men. When they arrived at a certain hermitage, he was told a story of a king who had been reincarnated as a demon who liked eating humans. The story was that there was once a king called Purusada or Kalmasapada. One day all the meat that had been set aside for the consumption of the king was eaten by dogs and pigs. The chef was concerned, and hurriedly sought out alternatives, but couldn't find any. In desperation he went to a graveyard and cut off the leg of one of the corpses and prepared it for his king. Because he had been reincarnated as a demon, he had found the meal very tasty, and he asked his chef what type of meat the chef had prepared. The chef admitted that the meat had been from a human, and from that moment on, the king loved eating humans. Soon there were no people left in his kingdom, either he had eaten his subjects, or they had fled. Soon the king suffered a wound in his leg which wouldn't heal, and he became more demonic and began to live in the jungle. By the time of Sutasoma's visit to the hermitage, the king had sworn that he would make an offering of 100 kings to the God Kala if he would cure him of his illness. The holy men begged Sutasoma to kill this demonic king, but he refused. Even the Goddess Prithvi beseeched him to kill the king, but he was adamant he would not do it, as he wished to live the life of an ascetic. So Sutasoma continued his journey. One day in the middle of the road he met a demon with an elephants head who preyed upon humans. Sutasoma nearly became his victim, but he fought the beast and struck him down so that he fell to the earth. It felt like Satusoma had tried to strike a mountain! The demon surrendered and received a sermon from Sutasoma about the Buddhist religion and that it is forbidden to kill any living creature. Afterwards, the demon became Sutasomo's disciple. And Sutasoma continued his journey. Next he met with a dragon. He defeated the dragon, and it also became his disciple. Finally, Sutasoma met a hungry tigress who preyed on her own children! But Sutasoma stopped her and told her why she shouldn't. But the tigress persisted. Finally Sutasoma offered his own body as food for the tigress. She jumped on him and sucked out his blood, which was fresh and tasty. But the tigress realised that what she had done was wrong, and she began to cry and repented. Then the God Indra appeared and made Sutasoma live again. The tiger also became his disciple, and they all continued their journey. By this time, there was a war between the demon king Kalmasapada and king Dasabahu, a cousin of Sutasoma. King Dasabahu happened to meet with Sutasoma and invited him home so that he could marry his daughter. Satusoma was married and returned home to Hastinapura. He had children and became King Sutasoma. Finally, the story of Purusada must be finished. He had gathered together the 100 kings to offer to the God Kala, but Kala didn't want to accept them. Kala wanted to be offered King Sutasoma instead! Purusada made war with Sutasoma, but because Sutasoma didn't resist, he was captured and sacrificed to Kala. Sutasoma was prepared to be eaten so that the 100 kings could go free. Purusada was so affected by this sacrifice that he tried to atone for it. The 100 kings were released. Historical Context Kakawin Sutasoma was written by Tantular in the 'golden age' of the Majapahit empire, during the reign of either Prince Rajasanagara or King Hayam Wuruk. It is not known for certain when the Kakawin was authored, but it is thought most probably between 1365 and 1389. 1365 is the year in which the Kakawin Nagarakretagama was completed, while 1389 is the year in which King Hayam Wuruk died. Kakawin Sutasoma was written after Kakawin Nagarakretagama. As well as authoring the Kakawin Sutasoma, Tantular is also known to have written Kakawin Arjunawiwaha. Both Kakakawin use very similar language and have a very similar style. Another well-known Kakawin, for example, is Kakawin Ramayana, Mahabarata, Bharatayudha, Gatotkacasraya, Smaradahana, Arjunawijaya, Siwaratrikalpa, and Kunjarakarna. Kakawin Sutasoma is considered unique in Javanese literature because it is the only Kakawin which is Buddhist in nature. Existing copies of Kakawin Sutasoma have survived in the form of handwritten manuscripts, written both on lontar and on paper. Nearly all surviving copies originated in Bali. However, there is one Javanese fragment surviving which forms part of the 'Merapi and Merbabu Collection'. This is a collection of ancient manuscripts originating from the region of the mountains of Merapi and Merbabu in Central Java. The survival of this fragment confirms that the text of Kakawin Sutasoma is indeed Javanese rather than Balinese in origin. Kakawin Sutasoma is one of the most popular Kakawin in Bali, and was popularised by I Gusti Surgria, an expert in Balinese literature who included examples from the Kakawin in his book on the study of Kakawin. Publication Between 1959 - 1961 I Gusti Bagus Sugriwa worked on an edition of the text which included the Old Javanese version of the text accompanied by a translation into Indonesian. It was also translated and published in English by Soewito Santoso. Extracts of the text were published in 1975. Another English translation was published in 2008 by Kate O'Brien. There have also been many extracts published in Bali, although they have Balinese characteristics and are translated into Balinese. References * Dinas Pendidikan Bali, 1993, Kakawin Sutasoma.

This is due to an estimated reduction in population size of 50% which is caused by the degradation of habitats where populations occur. Reproductive phenology Magnolia espinalii presents good amount of flower buds almost along the whole year, with a slightly decrease during the end of the second rain period and during the beginning of the dry season (November, December and January). As other magnolias species monitored, presents high percentage of flower bud fall, which are aborted without completing their development. Although fruit production is low, two fruit production periods can be noted, one from March to April and one from October to November. It takes from 5 to 6 months to the fruit to complete their development and ripe. Seed management, sexual propagation and nursery production =Fruit and seed description= The fruit is woody, elliptic, measuring from 6,9 to 8,5 cm long and from 3,3 to 4,5 cm broad. Only 50 to 80% of the seeds develop completely. The seeds are smooth, colored from dark brown to black, irregular shape resembling a heart. The seeds size goes from 10 to 14 mm broad and from 9 to 12 mm long. The seed are covered by an aromatic reddish fleshy layer called sarcotesta. 1’000 seeds weight from 195 to 215 grams and 1 kilogram can have 4’650 to 5’130 seeds. The dispersal of seeds is done by birds and small mammals.Fenología reprodutiva de especies forestales nativas presentes en la jurisdición de CORANTIOQUIA, un paso hacia su conservación. Volumen II / Martha Ligia Gómez Restrepo, Coorporaciñon Autónoma Regional del Centro de Antioquia, CORANTIOQUIA. Medellín: CORANTIOQUIA, 2011. 132 p. il., fotos a color. =Collecting and processing the fruits= Two harvest periods during the high rainfall months have been identified. One starts in March and ends in April and the second goes from October to November. The best option is to harvest the fruits directly from the trees before they open and release the seeds. However, when this is not possible, fruits can be collected from the ground. If fruits are collected from the ground, fruits and seeds that present signs of rot or insect attack should be discarded. In order to optimize fruit harvest directly from the tree, a system was designed to identify green fruits and protects its fruits using a small basket which can be built with wire and plastic mesh (with mesh size of 1 mm or less). These baskets protect the fruits from predation and decreases the chances of losing the fruits. Once the fruit starts dehiscence, they are collected manually (climbing the tree) or using an extension pruning pole. If the fruits are collected when they are still closed, they should be stored in shade until they dehiscence, then the seeds should be extracted and select only those with bright red sarcotesta (indicates the seeds are ripe). In order to clean the seeds and remove the bright red aril, the seeds should be put into water overnight, macerated and rinsed using running water. It is recommended to make an immersion in sodium hypochlorite 1% for 15 minutes to prevent infestation by fungi. =Seed storage= According to preliminary studies, the seeds quickly lose viability and therefore should be sown as fresh as possible. When this is not possible, it is recommended to keep them for a short period of time with the red sarcotesta within a wet substrate (sawdust and sand, for example), airtight container and at low temperature (about 4 °C). =Sowing and germination= The fresh seeds do not need a pre- germination treatment; nevertheless, it is advisable to pay attention to the luminous conditions because this is a factor that affects the final results. For example, fresh seeds sowed in a substratum of soil and sand (proportion 2:1), under two very different luminous conditions (full sun exposition and darkness) showed a germination capacity of 60% and 80%, respectively. The germination of the sowed seeds under full exposition started after 46 days and was completed a month later, while the seeds sowed under a complete darkness started 69 days and was completed 19 days after. The germination is epigeous, starts from 45 to 60 days after sowing and is completed 30 days after. Two weeks after the germination, seedlings had already unfolded the cotyledon leaves and it showed 3, 5 cm average height. =Handling of seedlings in nursery= For a better dissemination, we can use a mix of soil and sand (2:1 proportion). Once seedlings reached 4 cm of height they can be moved into a bag. After this process, it is advisable to leave the plants under shade and reduce it gradually. When seedlings reach 25 to 30 cm of height, they are ready to be planted definitively in the field (with a shade-providing roof in case of sunny stands). References * Diana M. López-A, Brian C.

It occurs in humid montane forests and humid pre-montane forests. Usually it can be found dispersed in small forest patches or as lonely trees on pasture lands. It was reported in Angostura, Valdivia and Yarumal Municipalities. Uses It has been widely used in carpentry and woodworking, furniture making, floor, beams. It has great potential for ornamental uses. Conservation It is listed in the category “Endangered” (EN) in the Red Book of Plants of Colombia.Calderón S., E.; A. Cogollo P; C. Velásquez R.; M.

Reproductive phenology Magnolia guatapensis produces flower buds almost along the whole year, presenting higher production at the beginning of the rainy season in April and May. According to monitoring activities, a high percentage of flower buds are aborted before becoming a flower. Fruit formation derived from the few remained flowers can take from 4 to 5 months. Although throughout the year the presence of flowers and fruits are observed in different stages of formation, harvest is done during the months of high rainfall such as August and September. Seed management, sexual propagation and nursery production =Fruit and seed description= It is a woody fruit, elliptic, green colored, measuring from 3 to 4 cm long and from 2,4 to 2,8 cm broad. Each fruit has 13 to 20 seeds and some of them can be formed completely. The seeds are smooth, dark brown, measuring from 13 to 20 mm broad, 6,2 to 10,8 mm long and 3,1 and 4,2 mm tick. The seeds are covered by an aromatic reddish fleshy layer named sarcotesta. The moister content of fresh seeds is around 35,3%. 1’000 seeds weight from 108 to 125 grams and 1 kilogram can have from 8’000 to 9’260 seeds. =Collecting and processing the fruits= Fruit harvest is made during August and September, which are months with high rainfall. Since the fruits are dehiscent, it is recommended to harvest the fruits directly from the trees before they open to release the seeds when they are still green, but opening lines can already be seen. If the tree is not too high, harvest can be done using an extension pruning pole. However, if the canopy is not reachable from the ground, fruits and seeds can be collected from the ground, always taking care to eliminate seeds and fruits with fungus presence or holes caused by insects. Climbing trees is another way to collect the fruits because they can be harvested when they are still closed and they dehiscent after being picked. In some cases it is possible to collect seeds that are hanging from open fruits on the trees. Seeds transportation or seed storage should be done using sealed plastic bags together with wet sawdust and kept in a cool place. Once the fruits have dehiscence, mature seeds are extracted and the ones with good phytosanitary conditions are selected. In order to remove the red sacotesta covering the seeds, they should be immersed in cold water for 24 hours, then macerated and rinsed with water. =Seed storage= According to previous studies it has been possible to determine that seeds are very sensitive to the desiccation and for this reason it is advisable to avoid to store them. They have to be sowed immediately after the collection. =Sowing and germination= The germination capacity of fresh seeds is very variable. In different tests done with the same substratum (mix of soil and sand, 2:1 proportion), very distinct germination values: between 25 and 73% of germination capacity have been reached. On the other hand, concerning the previous hydration of the seeds during 17 hours before sowing, the hydration held up the germination for up to one month. Nevertheless, the germination capacity did not change: Before sowing, it is advisable to stir the sarcotesta of the seeds, clean it with running water and emerge it into a solution of 1% sodium hypochlorite during 45 minutes to avoid fungal infestations. The germination is epigeous, starts 56 to 64 days after sowing and is completed 20 days later. =Handling of seedlings in nursery= For a better dissemination It is recommendable to use a mix of soil and sand in 2:1 proportion. Once seedlings reached 4 cm of height we can move it to a bag. After this process, it is advisable to leave the plants under shade and reduce it gradually. When seedlings reach 25 cm of height and have been hardened at least a little, we can consider that they are ready to be planted definitively at the field.

Locally called molinillo, the tree is endemic to the Cauca river watershed and surroundings, from Antioquia department to the South of Valle department. It is distributed between 1700 and 2600 m. Currently the species only occurs in a few locations with remains of old-growth primary forest, on the slopes of the Occidental and Central Andean Cordillera, in Valle, Quindío, Antioquia and Risaralda departments. In Risaralda department, it is very scarce, there is confirmed presence of the species in the Municipalities of Santuario, La Celia, Pereira and potentially in rural areas of the municipalities of Pueblo Rico, Belén de Umbría, Apía and Balboa. Its distribution is critically endangered principally because of expansion of coffee growth, and livestock grazing areas, construction of housing and roads, and especially due to its overexploitation for use as sawnwood. Description They are trees reaching from 18 to 30 m height and 50–70 cm in diameter, wide dark green canopy. The bark is almost smooth, pale brown. Fine texture wood. Leaves alternate, simple, ovate leathery, glabrous, apex rounded, entire margin, cuneate base, prominent veins on the bottom of the leaves. The petiole has a scar covering its entire surface. The flowers are solitary, glabrous; white to cream color, locates at the end of the branches, peduncle are thicker towards the apex. Flower bud enclosed within an involucre by four bracts usually covered with pubescence; 3 elliptical sepals, white, fleshy; has from 8 to 10 petals cream colored, thick and oblong. Woody fruit, sub-globose, glabrous, green colored, measuring between 9,7 and 20 cm long and 8–25 cm broad; when the fruits dehiscence, seeds remain attached in its central axis.

It is a tree located in the canopy top that grows in disturbed primary forest fragments and stubble, or as solitary tree in grazing areas or coffee plantations, mainly on peaks or mountain slopes. It is reported in the municipalities of Andes, Betulia, Buriticá, Caramanta, Cuidad Bolívar, Ebéjico, Jardín, Pueblo Rico and Támesis. Uses The central axis of the fruit has been used for many years in the manufacture of pinwheel . The wood has been used on carpentry and woodworking. The species also has potential do be used as ornamental because of its great shape, shiny foliage and flower size.

This is due to diminishing of its population size estimated above 50%, which, in turn, is caused by the loss of their natural habitats. Reproductive phenology According to observations, the trees of M. hernandezii present almost constant amount of flowers and flower buds along the year. During the months of June and July the production of flowers and flower bud decrease because of the lack of rainfall comparing to other months. Although there is no specific time for harvesting the fruits as these are present constantly and at different stages of development, a greater proportion of mature fruits were recorded during the months of September, October, December, January and June. As observed the formation and development of the fruits take between 7 and 8 months, which are longer than for other species. This might be due to the bigger size of its fruits. Seed management, sexual propagation and nursery production =Fruit and seed description= Open dry fruit of M. hernandezii Fruit of M. hernandezii It is a woody fruit,subglobose, glabrous, green colored, measuring from 9,7 to 20 cm long and from 8 to 25 cm broad; when the fruits dehiscence, seeds remain attached in its central axis. Each fruit has 1105 to 219 seeds and in some cases more than 50% of it is not fully formed. Each follicle contains 1 to 2 seeds. The seeds are smooth, dark brown, measuring from 13 to 20 mm broad, 6,2 to 10,8 mm long and 3,1 and 4,2 mm tick. The seeds are covered by an aromatic reddish fleshy layer named sarcotesta.

Since the fruits are dehiscent, it is recommended to harvest the fruits directly from the trees before they open to release the seeds when they are still green, but opening lines can be seeing. The safest and more recommendable way to collect the fruits is directly from the tree using a climbing technique that doesn’t damage the bark. In some cases when the trees are not too height and the branches are easy to reach, it is recommended to collect the fruit from the ground using an extension pruning pole. When collecting from the ground, special attention should be given to the presence of insect hole and fungus in the fruits to eliminate those fruits. Once the fruits have dehiscence, mature seeds are extracted and the ones with good phytosanitary conditions are selected. In order to remove the red sacotesta covering the seeds, they should be immersed in cold water for 24 hours, then macerated and rinsed with water. =Seed storage= In accordance with previous studies it is not advisable to keep the seeds, because they are very sensitive to the desiccation. Nevertheless, if it is not possible to proceed to the sowing immediately we can keep it in the fridge for few days with the red sarcotesta in a closed container with sawdust. =Sowing and germination= Before sowing, it is advisable to stir the sarcotesta of the seeds, clean it with running water and emerge it into a solution of 1% sodium hypochlorite during 15 minutes to avoid fungal infestations. For a better germination it is suggested to hydrate the seeds during 12 hours and sow it after in a mix of soil and sand (2:1 proportion). With this process the germination capacity is changing from 60 to 68%, while in no hydrated seeds the germination capacity oscillates between 40 and 48%. Germination starts between 56 and 61 days after sowing and is completed 30 or 40 days after. It is not important if they have exposed to the sunlight or under shade. Another option to improve the dissemination of the species is to mix the seeds (previously hydrated during 12 hours) with wet sawdust and to put it into black bags. With this process, the germination starts two months after sowing and is completed three months later. The average of germination is 74% that oscillates between 52 and 92%. The germination is epigeous. =Handling of seedlings in nursery= For a better dissemination it is recommendable to use a mix of soil and sand in 2:1 proportion. Once seedlings reached 4 cm of height we can move it to a bag. After this process, it is advisable to leave the plants under shade and reduce it gradually.

It is one of the most important examples of Brick Gothic and Weser Renaissance architecture in Europe. Since 1973, it has been a protected historical building. In July 2004, along with the Bremen Roland statue, the building was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.  Locality  The city hall is on the northeastern side of the market square in the historic city center. Directly in front of it is the statue of Roland. On the opposite side of that square there is the ancient guildhall, called Schütting, still today seat of the board of commerce. On the southeastern side of the square is the seat of Bremen state parliament, called the Bürgerschaft. East of both, there is the town hall and parliament, along with the Bremen Cathedral. Near the northern corner of the town hall, there is a sculpture of the Town Musicians of Bremen (by Gerhard Marcks). North of it, there is the Church of Our Dear Lady (\\"Kirche Unser Lieben Frauen\\" or short \\"Liebfrauenkirche\\").  History  = The ancient town hall = thumbBremen in 1603: = Gothic town hall = archbishop's palace = adaptions or descessors of the ancient town hall red outline = dismantled arch,drawn after the topographically quite incorrect map by Frans Hogenberg = descessor buildings of the ancient office = probable other relics or descessors of the ancient town hall group Bremen's original town hall had been situated in the southern end of the block between Liebfrauenkirchhof (\\"Our Dear Lady's Churchyard\\"), Obernstraße (\\"Highstreet\\") and Sögestraße (\\"Pigstreet\\"). In 1229, it was mentioned as \\"domus theatralis\\" (\\"show house\\"), since 1251 repeatedly as \\"domus consularis\\" (\\"councilars' house\\"). An arch across the Sögestraße and a repair by a mason suggest a stone building, and already existing before the arrival of Gothic style it must have been erected in Romanesque style. It is assumed that before the municipality gained a certain autonomy, the building served as a law court and therefore had at least one open hall, as old Saxon law forbade trials to be held in closed rooms. An exact description is not available, but several documents tell about the cloth shops in that location. They describe the locations of \\"sub\\" (\\"below\\") being the town hall and the office. Depending on the interpretation of \\"below\\" as \\"in the hall below …\\" or \\"in front of the basement of …\\", the documents suggest very different settings of the town hall and its environment. Two texts tell of a stair or staircase of the house at Liebfrauenkirchhof. After the construction of the newer town hall, it was hired out to the grocers' guild, than as a hobs store. Finally in 1598, it was sold to two owners, who converted it to or replaced it as their private houses. = The Gothic town hall = Roland sculpture 1596, town hall (on the right) still with pointed arch windows 1603, market front with ten large rectangular windows 1641, market front with Renaissance gables Around 1400, when the development of Bremen was at its height, a new town hall was planned and built. Most engaged were burgomaster Johann Hemeling and councilmen Friedrich Wagner and Hinrich von der Trupe. The location and design were a demonstration of confidence vis-à-vis the archbishop. Bremen Market Square, completed a century before, was now dominated by the town hall rather than by the cathedral and the archbishop's palace. Both of its two halls, the upper hall and the lower hall, were a few inches longer and wider than the great hall of the episcopal palace. As in the palace, the entrances were placed at the sides rather than facing the square. The Ratskeller is below those halls. With the construction of the town hall, the first Roland sculpture was erected in front of it. It was not yet as large as today. The town hall in Gothic style was decorated with 16 large sculptures, showing emperors and prince- electors, demonstrating Bremen's claim of being an imperial city, and four ancient philosophers. But at the same time it was fortified; there were two wall-walks, one above the gallery towards the market square and one all around the gutters of the hip-roof. Four small towers with staircases served the access from the upper hall to the upper wall-walk. The gallery on ground level towards the market square during the first centuries was no shelter for merchants, it was reserved for trials. On the rear side of the Gothic town hall, there was an extension, in the upper flour containing the room for the city council, called Altes Wittheits-Stube, (The Old Council Chamber). West of it, there was an outer staircase from Our Dear Lady's Churchyard to the upper hall. After the Rebellion of the 104 Men in 1432, the outer staircase was removed. In the end of 15th century, an office was built below the old Wittheits-Stube. = Renaissance = In 1545 to 1550, an extension with three floors, containing a new Wittheits-Stube and offices, was built between the town hall and the archbishop's palace, showing a Renaissance style gable eastward facing the cathedral. In the end of the century, Bremen lived through its second boom, and a great relaunch of the town hall was headed. The main artist was the architect and mason Lüder von Bentheim. The modernization took place in two steps: in the first step, during 1595 to 1596, the ten windows of the upper hall towards the market square were converted from pointed arches to large rectangular windows. About twelve years later, from 1608 to 1612, a great transformation to Weser Renaissance was started: The two middling windows and the proclamation door between them were displaced by a huge avant- corps, consisting of slim pillars and columns and large windows. On top, a decorated gable in Flemish Renaissance style was erected, two similar gables beside. Reliefs were used to decorate the facade. Many architectural elements based on masters of the Dutch Renaissance, such as Hans Vredeman de Vries, Hendrik Goltzius and Jacob Floris. Furthermore, decorative balustrades were installed. = Baroque = Office of 1682/83 and the Musicians of Bremen Rear side in 1683 Soon after the completion of those works, Germany was ravaged by the Thirty Years' War, and after the Peace of Westphalia, Bremen had to defend against Swedish invasion. In 1682/83, The office on the rear side was enlarged in a form of Baroque style – with horizontal rows of windows that did not become common before two centuries later. = 19th century = With the German mediatization in 1803, the neighboring archbishop's palace that had been extraterritorial, at last Hanoveran, became a municipal property. Provisionally, it was used for offices at once. In 1818/19, it was partly dismantled and rebuilt as the Neoclassical \\"Stadthaus\\" (municipal office building). In 1826, dangerous damage to representative town hall and its extensions was detected. With the repairs, the appearance of the market front was conserved, but the eastern Renaissance façade was replaced by a simple one and the rear side lost its unique design. = 20th century = Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque and Art Nouveau parts from northwest The Stadthaus in 1900 From 1820 to 1900, Bremen multiplied its population, and, in the decades around 1900, Wilhelminism preferred abundant representation. Therefore, an enlargement of the town hall was planned. In 1909, the Stadthaus was dismantled in order to build the new town hall on its ground. During that work, many Gothic artifacts were found, significantly more than historians expected. With the \\"Neues Rathaus\\" (\\"New Town Hall\\"), the town hall in 1909–1913 received an extension about twice as large as the old building. The Munich architect Gabriel von Seidl succeeded to avoid a dominance of his addition. Nevertheless, its three Neo-renaissance facades are a very late example of Historism. The fourth one, facing the Church of Our Lady and adjacent to the rest of the Baroque extension, is rather Art Nouveau. By boarding up the outer walls, and due to heroic efforts of the fire brigade, the town hall of Bremen survived the air raids of World War II with little damage, though more than sixty percent of the city was destroyed.

The ship plays a leading role in both The Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rackham's Treasure, published in 1943 and 1944, respectively. The Unicorn also appears in the 2011 film adaptation The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn. In the Tintin adventures, the Unicorn is the setting of a battle between pirates and sailors followed by a duel between its captain, Sir Francis Haddock (an ancestor of Captain Haddock) and the pirate Red Rackham. The Unicorn is scuttled and sinks, only to be discovered years later by Tintin and his friends in an attempt to locate Red Rackham's treasure. Creation Brillant, the ship of the line of Louis XIV's fleet that inspired Hergé to draw the Unicorn. The Unicorn was inspired by the 64-gun Brillant, built in 1690 at Le Havre, France by the shipwright Salicon and then decorated by the designer Jean Bérain the Elder. In 1942, Hergé had decided that his latest Tintin adventure, The Secret of the Unicorn (1943), should depict images of his fictional Unicorn as detailed precision drawings. He used the services of his friend and local model ship maker Gérard Liger-Belair, son of a former naval officer and who owned a shop in Brussels that specialised in model ships, to find an appropriate historical vessel that he could customize to meet his historical needs. Liger-Belair's research produced three possibilities: A British frigate, a Dutch merchant vessel, and a French battleship. As Hergé preferred the battleship, Liger-Belair continued to research and discovered a historic document titled ', which contained detailed drawings of French battleships. One in particular was from 1690, in the navy of Louis XIV of France, the 64-gun, Brillant. Liger-Belair soon completed a plan on a 1:100 scale followed by an extremely precise model. Hergé consulted the archives at the National Museum of Natural History and the then recently published ' (\\"Art and the Sea\\") by Alexandre Berqueman. He also studied other vessels from the period, such as the ', ', ' and ' to better understand 17th-century ship design. It was from the Le Reale de France that he gained a basis for his design of the Unicorn jolly boat. He adopted the fictional ship's unicorn figurehead from a British frigate which had been built in 1745. When Liger-Belair's model was complete, Hergé realised it into the panels of his comics, regularly showing his renditions to Liger-Belair to ensure he was depicting the vessel with no technical errors. In its finished appearance in the book, the Unicorn is a ship of the third rank, a vessel with three-masts and 50 guns, more than 40metres long and 11metres wide. After publication of The Secret of the Unicorn, Hergé's Dutch publisher Carlsen Verlag gave him an antique model of a 17th-century Danish ship called the ' (The Unicorn). Until that moment, Hergé had no idea that a ship with that name, complete with unicorn figurehead, had ever actually existed. In The Adventures of Tintin =Fictional history= The Secret of the Unicorn is partially set in 1676. In the English translation, the Unicorn sails under the Union Jack during the reign of Charles II of England and is commanded by Sir Francis Haddock, an ancestor of Captain Haddock. In Hergé's original French version, however, ' flies the French flag for the French Navy under King Louis XIV and is commanded by Chevalier François de Hadoque. No ship named the Unicorn was listed in the annals of the French Navy during the 17th century. However, from 1634-1688 the English Royal Navy had a ship of the line named HMS Unicorn which was, coincidentally, commanded by a Captain Haddock. Red Rackham's Treasure (1944) tells of the adventure Tintin and his friends undertake to recover the lost treasure of the pirate Red Rackham, believed by Tintin to be aboard the shipwrecked Unicorn. Sir Francis had built three models of the Unicorn and had hidden a treasure map inside each one. The adventure, told across both books, leads Tintin to the Unicorn and to the lost treasure. A 2011 feature film adaptation of both Tintin books retells the story of the Unicorn. The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn directed by Steven Spielberg and produced by Peter Jackson was released in October–December 2011. =Plot role= While sailing in the West Indies in 1676, the Unicorn, commanded by Sir Francis Haddock, is seized and captured by a group of pirates led by Red Rackham. The pirates hoist a red pennant—no life would be spared. During the battle, Sir Francis is hit and loses consciousness. Later, the members of the Unicorn crew still alive are killed or thrown overboard. Sir Francis regains consciousness, finding himself tied to the mainmast. The pirate ship is damaged and sinking, so Red Rackham moves his treasure on board the Unicorn. The ship then sails to an uninhabited island. When anchored near the shore of the island, Sir Francis manages to free himself and goes below deck to the Unicorn gunpowder stores. Whilst there, he encounters Rackham for the final time, killing him in a sword fight. Before escaping in the ship's jolly boat, he is able to set fire to the gunpowder by means of a slow-burning fuse, causing the Unicorn (with Rackham's drunken crew and presumably Red Rackham's treasure still aboard) to explode and sink. In the present day, Tintin, his dog Snowy, and his friends Captain Haddock and Professor Calculus follow coordinates that Sir Francis had left his three sons in a strange riddle hidden in three model ships of the Unicorn. Reaching the coordinates, they discover the island and, upon diving, they find the wreck of the Unicorn. Although they recover various artefacts from it, they do not find the treasure. Back in Belgium, Tintin realises that Sir Francis' message referred, not to the location of the Unicorn, but to a globe mounted on a statue in Sir Francis' former country home. Understanding now that Francis would never have left the treasure but would have taken it with him to his home, Tintin locates the coordinates to the treasure on the globe, presses a secret button he finds there, and discovers Red Rackham's treasure hidden inside.

Fruit collection should be done during the months of August, September and November, when fruits are most abundant. The fruits take at least 5 months to mature. Fruits are collected before or after they fall from the tree. Immature fruits may be left to ripen so that the seeds may be collected after dehiscence. The fruits are soaked and cleaned to retrieve the seeds. The seeds are sensitive to desiccation. They require no pre-germination treatment and can be sowed in a sand/soil mix.

They played original compositions and traditional music in a Celtic/British folk style, with influences from reggae, country, pop, jazz and world music. Successive regroupings of the band released nine albums over seventeen years, touring in Britain, Europe, Africa, Australia, New Zealand and the United States before finally disbanding in 2001. History The band's first performance took place in October 1984, at a school in Dalkeith. Its first contract was with Topic Records in London and the first album (The House Band) was recorded in January 1985. In 1985 The House Band performed in Italy in the Spring, and Germany and Switzerland in October and November. A tour of New Zealand took place from December 1985 until mid-February 1986, after which the original group disbanded. On returning to the UK, Chris Parkinson and Ged Foley formed a new group with John Skelton and Brian Brooks, later billing themselves as The New House Band. In 1987, they recorded a second album, Pacific, for Topic Records. Brian Brooks had lived in New York City for a while, so had some contacts which led to several gigs there in 1987. Ged Foley's prior association with Battlefield Band led to tours of the US after this — both Battlefield Band and The House Band worked with the same agency. These very successful tours continued until the end of the 1990s. Brooks left the band in 1988, after which the three remaining members recorded Word of Mouth at Topic Records' studios. During this period, the band also toured in Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya, with a stay in Zanzibar for a few days. The name for the band's next album (Stonetown) was inspired by the name of the old part of Zanzibar City, the capital of the island of Zanzibar. Immediately after a tour of the Netherlands and Belgium, the whole album was recorded in eight days in 1991, for Harbourtown Records. The photo for the sleeve of Stonetown was taken in Whitby (where Chris Parkinson was living at the time) and is, coincidentally, the same street where Simply Red had filmed part of the video for their song \\"Holding Back the Years\\". The album won a Music Retailers Association Annual Award for Excellence (in the Folk and Country Music category) in 1992. Following this, the band signed with Green Linnet Records, and in 1993 released a compilation of previous works entitled Groundwork. Roger Wilson joined the band on fiddle, guitar and vocals, and the album Another Setting followed in 1994. Bernie Nau (piano) and Mark Hellenberg (percussion) worked with the band as session musicians during the recording of this album. The next album was Rockall in 1996, which was also recorded in Vermont. After that, October Song was recorded at Studio du Chemin 4, Joliette, Quebec, in December 1997. The studio was owned by Denis Frechette, pianist with La Bottine Souriante, and the recording engineer was André Marchand (ex-member of La Bottine Souriante) who added some 'foot percussion' on one of the tracks. October Song was released in time for a tour of Australia and New Zealand in Spring of 1998, followed by tours of the UK, Europe and the US. Roger Wilson left the band after these tours, at the end of 1998. In April 2000, The New House Band was relaunched with a recording of a four-track demo in Ohio. A short tour of the US was arranged for December 2000, and a tour of the UK from May until June 2001. The UK tour also included gigs in Belgium and Denmark. A final album, The Very Best of The House Band, was released in 2001, after which the group disbanded.

Description  Trap Them's influences include hardcore punk bands, such as Black Flag, Born Against, and Tragedy; metal bands like Dismember and Entombed (whose \\"buzzsaw\\" guitar tone create the main guitar sound for Trap Them), and experimental bands like Swans. Ryan McKenney's lyrics tend to deal with issues both personal and political, while recent material has also contained a conceptual element to its lyricism. The group's musical style consists of complex and sometimes discordant guitar work and d-beat and grindcore drumming styles. Trap Them take their name from the 1977 film by Joe D'Amato called Trap Them And Kill Them, known also as Emanuelle E Gli Ultimi Cannibali and Emanuelle and the Last Cannibals. The movie features European exploitation queen Laura Gemser.  History  Trap Them began as a side-project for Ryan McKenney (former vocalist of Backstabbers Incorporated) and Brian Izzi (guitarist of December Wolves) in 2001 while Izzi was beginning his stint as second guitarist for Backstabbers Inc. The two met while working together at Newbury Comics in Salem, NH and immediately became close friends. The band grew into a full-time consideration years later after both men left BSI to focus on other things. McKenney and Izzi later became roommates and began focusing on new material for the band. In 2006, the band reached an agreement with the Trash Art! record label to release a vinyl-only EP and a full-length album to be recorded with Kurt Ballou at the God City recording studio and released later that year. The resulting album and single, including a spoken word piece by McKenney, were released in January and April 2007. In late 2007, Trap Them signed with Converge's Jacob Bannon's music label, Deathwish Inc.. They toured Europe in early 2008 with The Ocean and Rotten Sound. Trap Them worked with crust punk band Extreme Noise Terror for a split EP and toured the U.S. with Napalm Death. A new full-length album, Seizures in Barren Praise, was released in November 2008. In May 2009, the band played on the year's bill for the annual Maryland Deathfest music festival in Baltimore, Maryland. The band went on US tours with Victims and Black Breath in May and June 2009, and Skeletonwitch and Saviours in mid-July. In 2010 the band released the EP Filth Rations, initially only as a strictly limited cassette release restricted to just fifty copies available at their appearance at the Scion Rock Festival. The EP was later released on Southern Lord Records on 12\\" vinyl featuring an etching on the B-side by artist Justin Bartlett, who also drew the main cover. In late 2010, it was announced that in March 2011 the band would release their third full-length Darker Handcraft through Prosthetic Records - their first for the label since signing for them in mid-2009. In April 2011, the band embarked on a European tour to promote the album as main support for the Finnish grindcore band Rotten Sound. On April 7, 2014, the band announced that they had completed work on their following album, titled \\"Blissfucker\\", which was released on June 10, 2014. It was the first album to feature their new bassist, Galen Baudhuin (Infera Bruo), and drummer Brad Fickeisen (No Salvation, ex-The Red Chord). \\"Crown Feral\\", the band's fifth and final studio album, was released on September 23rd 2016, via Prosthetic Records. The album was again recorded with producer Kurt Ballou at the God City recording studio and featured artwork from artist Mattias Frisk. The band performed their final three shows in November in New York City, Montreal and Boston before disbanding.

Education Ágoston Pável was born in Cankova (then part of Vas County) as the third child of Iván Pável, a tailor, and Erzsébet Obal. He attended elementary school in his native village. Despite his Slovene mother tongue, Ágoston Pável graduated with excellence from a Hungarian-speaking high school in Szentgotthárd, being the top student among 28 from 1897 through 1901. Already in the early days, an amicable relationship developed between Pável and his class teacher Győző Schmidt. Schmidt, who was the high school's librarian and the editor of the local newspaper, taught him both Hungarian and Latin. Pável continued his studies at Premont College in Szombathely (1901–05). While attending college, he participated in the \\"Society for Voluntary Further Education\\". In the internal gazette called \\"Bimbófüzér\\" some of his first epigrams, ballads and historical elegies appeared. From 1905 to 1909, Pável studied Hungarian and Latin at the Philosophical Faculty of Péter Pázmány University in Budapest. Beside his specialist area he attended classes in Serbo-Croatian and Russian languages and in comparative research of Slavonic languages as a research associate. Pável gained a scholarship, was exempted from tuition fees and taught as an assistant professor, where one of his students was Albert Szent-Györgyi, later a Nobel Prize winner in Physiology. On May 15, 1909 he published a critical essay on two disquisitions by Oszkár Asbóth on Slavic-Hungarian speech forms -- one which scrutinized Slavic stem words and the mutations of the sounds \\"j\\" and \\"gy\\" among Hungarian Slovenes, and another on the academic speech of western Hungary, which had been Pável's research focus. The first verses of Pável Ágoston were published (in Hungarian) in the newspaper Muraszombat és Vidéke (\\"Murska Sobota and its district\\") and (in the Prekmurje dialect of Slovene) in \\"Novine\\", \\"Martijin List\\" and \\"Kolendar\\". On November 13, 1909 Pável read some Slovene verse translations and some of his own poetry at the Hungarian folklore symposium. Also in 1909 the Hungarian Academy of Science published Pável's essay on the phonology of the Slovene language in the language district of Vashidegkút; the essay formed a part of his dissertation. This work won an award at the University and was highly recognized. Professor Asbóth commented: \\"I am a little angry, however, not at Pletersnik [a Slovene linguist and literary historian], but at such Hungarian linguists who use their vocabulary with simplicity. I explicitly recommend them Pável's rich essays, because they can learn a lot from them.\\" Military service and teaching career In 1909-10 Ágoston Pável served in the 7th Graz and then in the 82nd Székelyudvarhely (Transylvania) infantry. Due to an administrative mistake, the infantry number 83 was mistakenly written as number 82 and he was detailed to military service in Transylvania. The \\"People's News\\" of 1986 wrote in commemoration of Pável that he spent his little spare time in the army in collecting popular verse, songs, customs and clothing. From 1910 to 1911 Pável served a practicum teaching at the academic main high school in the Budapest second district. From 1911 to 1913 he was a substitute teacher at the national main high school of Torda. On April 14, 1914 he married Irene Benko in Szentgotthárd. On June 10, 1914 he became a fully certified teacher but was promptly drafted into military service. On September 6 he was badly injured in the battle of Lemberg (Lviv), which resulted in five years of illness. In 1986 the \\"People's News\\" noted: \\"Pável Ágoston despised the war a lot. What bigger joy could have befallen him than being injured right in the first battle, since he could get away from this senseless war. During the years of sickness he kept writing and translating.\\" In 1916 Pável received a Hungarian Academy of Science award for his work \\"The Modern Slovene Literary Language\\". \\"With his work the author shows the ambitions that can be noticed in the field of literary language, with great poetic-linguistic expertise and with the basic knowledge of the national Slovene language, which approximates the Slovene language that can be found in Austria and differs from it in its popularity\\" (Academic information sheet, May 1917). In May 1919 he was elected as a member of the Department of Public Education of Dombóvár and was also appointed to the editorial committee of the local weekly paper. From May 1920 till August 1933 he worked as a teacher at the national girls' high school of Szombathely. On November 16, 1920 he was appointed to the Philosophical Faculty of the University of Ljubljana. Literary and academic work In 1924, he was in charge of the library of the cultural organisation of Vas County and of the city of Szombathely. In 1925 he compiled and published service directory of cultural organisations for the library of Vas County and the city of Szombathely. By January 1, 1926 he had completed the indexing and restructuring of the museum library. \\"The year 1926 marks a watershed in the history of the cultural organisation library, because due to the cooperation of Pável Ágoston a new vitality ran through the veins of the library, and thus the former strict rules and restrictions were lifted.\\" In February 1928 began a friendship with Ferenc Móra and Vilko Novak. In September 1928 he took charge of the museum of Vas County and of the folklore magazine, and in November 1928 of that year Pável founded the Association of Amity of the Vas County Museum. For the school year 1928-29 Pável opened his home to the 15-year-old Sándor Weöres, who was later to become a well-known Hungarian poet. On April 27, 1932 Pável became a member of the caucus of the Folklore Society, and on June 12, 1939 a member of the correspondence department. In December 1932 was published his first compendium of verse called \\"Praying in The Bosom of The Blind Valley\\". From March 1933 until his death in 1946 he was the editor of the scientific journal Vasi Szemle (\\"Vas Review\\"). Pável formulated and declared the journal's objective as \\"a dedication to and an appreciation of the cultural problems in the history of Vas County and west Hungary.\\" On August 1, 1933 he was shifted to Faludi High School. In 1934 became an honorary secretary member of the Hungarian National Culture Association. In the same year he gained membership of the Erdély Szépmíves Céh publishing company. From March 26, 1936 he was a member of the Tömörkény Society in Szeged. In the spring of 1936 he and Dr. Sándor Gonyei went on a journey through the Örség National Park, which resulted in his work \\"Pictures from Örség\\". In 1936 his second compendium of verse, entitled \\"Forest On Fire\\", was published. In 1937 Pável's translation of the most significant literary works of Ivan Cankar -- Hlapec Jernej in njegova resnica (\\"The Bailiff Yerney and His Right\\"), Potepuh Marko (\\"Scapegrace Marko\\") and the novel Kralj Matjaž (\\"King Matthew\\") -- were published in \\"Nyugat\\". In 1940 due to the fusion of Vas County and Zala County the Vas review expanded its mandate to become a review for western Hungary. On June 15, 1940 he became a member of the Gárdony Society. On August 26, 1940 he again visited Örség, where together with István Győrffy and Károly Visky he accumulated material for a monograph. On December 13, 1940 he was elected member of the Pen Klub. In 1941 the translation of the literary works of Ivan Cankar appeared as part of the series on south Slavic authors. The Hungarian culture review wrote on March 15, 1941: \\"The translation by Ágoston Pável is artistic and perfect.\\" In February 1941 at the Philosophical Faculty of Szeged University Pável was private tutor for the subjects of South Slavic language and literature, and on September 27 of that year he joined the Janus Pannonius Society. In 1944 he developed the curriculum for the study of the Hungarian language and composed a Hungarian literary history for use in the schools in the Mura region in Slovene-speaking Hungary. in May 1945 he was elected president of the local pedagogic \\"Free Province Organisation\\" and began work as an official interpreter for Russian in Vas County. In June 1945, on his own initiative, he developed and taught the first Russian course to be held in Szombathely. On November 18, 1945 he was a member of the János Batsányi Literary Society of Pécs. Ágoston Pável died on January 2, 1946 in Szombathely.

The species also has potential do be used as ornamental. Conservation It is listed in category “Endangered” (EN) in the Red Book of Plants of Colombia. and as “Endangered” (EN) by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. This is due to selective logging and the destruction and fragmentation of their forests. Reproductive phenology The trees of this species produce flowers along the year; however, the higher production is concentrated in the dry season and the beginning of rainy season (between the months of December and May). Most trees have fruits all year round; however, very few of them reach maturity due to mass abortion of flowers and fruits at different stages of development. Ripe fruits can be found in any season given the dispersion of reproductive events; nevertheless it is during August, September and October that the best harvest has been done. The time of formation and development of the fruits is around 4 to 5 months.Gómez R., M.L. 2010.

Each carpel has 1 to 2 seeds, and in total may contain about 27 seeds, many of them are not fully developed. The seeds have a fleshy scarlet red aromatic cover; the seed coat is hard, smooth, dark brown to black; their shape is triangular, measuring from 8,5 to 10,1 mm wide and from 8,3 to 9,1 mm high and from 3,9 to 4,6 mm thick. The moisture content of fresh seeds can be about 25,4%. The weight of 1’000 seeds ranges between 144,1 and 165,5 grams and one kilogram can contain between 6’000 and 7’000 seeds. =Collecting and processing the fruits= Detail M. yarumalenseFruits should be harvested during the months of August, September and October (high rainfall) that is the time which higher concentration of fruits. The fruits and the seeds can be collected directly from the ground, however, the falling green fruits usually contain few seeds developed; it is common to find fruits and seeds that are decomposed or attacked by insects. To avoid losses, plastic tarp can be placed under the canopy to collect material falling from the tree. Another possibility is to climb the tree and collect seeds directly from open fruits or collect ripe fruits that are still closed and put in the post-mature processing and thereby control the process of dehiscence. If the tree is difficult to climb or the equipment is not adequate, the material can be collected using an extension pruning pole. The collecting features some of the following disadvantages: the fruits and seeds are susceptible to insect attacks, or are eaten by wildlife since they are an important source of food; many fruits that are still green with immature seeds are aborted; ripe fruits can dehiscence and drop the seeds. Because of this, the scarcity of individuals of this species, low seed production, the harvest time is still unknown, it has been necessary to develop an appropriate system in order to optimize the collection. The system consist in build a basket using wire and plastic mesh (with mesh size of 1 mm or less). This way it is possible to overcome the disadvantages mentioned and collect (manually or using an extension pruning pole) the green fruits that are closed to post-mature, open ripe fruits with the seeds still attached to the central axis or detached seeds. In all collection systems described above, the selection of seeds should be done. Seeds that present biotic or abiotic damage or any kind of infestation should be discard. =Seed storage= In accordance with previous studies it is not advisable to keep the seeds, because they are very sensitive to desiccation and they lose their viability. Nevertheless, if it is not possible to proceed to the sowing immediately we can keep it in the fridge for few days with the red sarcotesta in a closed container with wet substratum (sawdust or sans, among others) at low temperatures (4 °C approx.). =Sowing and germination= These seeds do not require a pre-germination treatment. Before sowing, it is advisable to stir the sarcotesta of the seeds, clean it with running water and emerge it into a solution of 1% sodium hypochlorite during 15 minutes to avoid fungal infestations. When these seeds are sowed in a substratum with soil under obscurity conditions could have a germination capacity that oscillates between 80 and 90%. Germination starts between 39 and 46 days after sowing and is completed between 20 and 30 days after. Nevertheless, when seeds germinate in a black bag with sawdust substratum the germination capacity oscillates between 68 and 100%, stars 55 days after sowing and is completed 2 months after. The germination is epigeous and starts each one month and a half after sowing and is completed 30 days after approx. Seedlings present a high percentage of survival within the replanting. =Handling of seedlings in nursery= It is advisable to proceed to the dissemination as follows: we put some seeds in a black bag and with wet sawdust, after we close the bag and we leave in a nursery. This method allows to minimize the space used, does not present continuous risk, it is easier to control the insects attacks and/or pathogen, the substratum used is cheap and easy to get, the vegetal material produced is of good quality, among others advantages. It is recommendable to monitoring periodically in order to extract the seedling germinated. If we do not do this, the seedlings could suffer morpho-physiological damages such as malformation of the root system and forming mould. Other aspect to take in consideration is the position of the seed in open bags. It is important to sow it in a flat shape because that assures that the radicle is going to contact the substratum rapidly. When we sow in obscurity, once germinated, it is advisable to replant rapidly to avoid physiological problems such as moulding. The seedlings of this species present a high percentage of survival after replanting. They are plants of rapid growth initially and after slow. It is recommendable to keep it under shade or semi-shade.

Primarily a sculptor, she works in a variety of media and addresses an eclectic array of topics, with exploration of boundaries a recurring theme: between the tangible and intangible worlds; between the genders; between the individual and society. Humor and satire abound in Holbrow's art. Notable exhibitions, installations and awards Holbrow's career highlights demonstrate both the restlessness of her vision and her skill at executing her conceptions. She has won a Gold Medal at the Massachusetts Horticultural Society’s prestigious Annual Flower Show, with The Root-Children, which addressed that year’s show theme, “Deeply Rooted.” She won Best of Show at the Cambridge, MA Art Association's National Prize Show with Queen Kong, a Barbie contemplating a diminutive, apish Ken in her clutches. And Make Way for Calflings, a piece submitted for a citywide exhibition featuring cow-themed pieces from artists across America, earned $50,000 at an auction for Boston's Jimmy Fund – by far the highest value fetched by any of that project's many well-received pieces. Other memorable pieces and exhibitions have included Keep it Clean, a table fountain featuring a nude Ken and Barbie together in a (working) miniature shower; It Was Here, a bronze and concrete “historical marker” that lures the observer into noting the infinite, overlooked value of the present moment; and River of Grass, a living sculpture at the Chesterwood Estate and Museum in Stockbridge, MA, in which Holbrow transforms a line of tall grass and wildflowers into a stream, waterfall and pool coursing through the estate's carefully manicured grounds. Early life and education Holbrow was born in New York City. Her physicist father's professional pursuits kept the family constantly on the move during her childhood, and she attended a large number of schools, public and private, before graduating from the George School in Newtown, PA, in 1975. She enrolled in the University of Wisconsin–Madison and earned a bachelor's degree in linguistics in 1980; she studied medicine for a year but found medical studies unfulfilling and left to begin a family. She is a mother of four. Artistic training, development and philosophy Holbrow first studied commercial art in the mid-1980s, at the Madison Area Technical College in Madison, WI, but it would be some time before her creative focus turned strongly to art. In 1989, she and her husband moved their family to Frankfurt, Germany, and while there, Holbrow did professional graphic-arts work, received classical voice training, and involved herself in the local choral and opera community. During a visit to the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam in 1998, Holbrow realized Von Gogh's student art was as primitive and problematic, as the paintings on which she was then laboring; perhaps hers held some promise as well. Her serious study of fine art began at this point. Returning to America in 1998, Holbrow earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in Studio Art in 2001 from Framingham State College in Massachusetts, and soon after started teaching art herself at the Danforth Museum. A view of Reflection, installation at the Danforth Museum in Framingham, MA in 2007. Holbrow's training reflects her quirky willingness to tackle a vast variety of media, subjects and issues: she lists auto-body training along with more conventional pursuits such as stone carving on her vitae. Holbrow says her overarching motivation as an artist is “making people pay attention”: experientially as with It Was Here, or to social/political issues as with her extensive forays into Barbie art, which have won her frequent acclaim. Holbrow's take on the way Barbie, personifying women in America, is idealized in order to be vilified: “Barbie is our shadow and you have to embrace your shadow.” In her artist's statement accompanying Speech Balloons, a body of work that seeks to manifest communication in tangible form, Holbrow wrote: “My task as an artist is to serve as channel between the seen and unseen worlds, facilitating the flow, and creating or revealing connections which nourish the inner lives of individuals and the community.” Selected awards and achievements *\\"Make Way For Calflings\\" raises $50,000 at auction for the Jimmy Fund, Boston, 2006 *Artist's Valentine Grant Competition winner for Speech Balloon body of work, Ann Wilson Lloyd, juror, Groton, MA, 2006 *Best of Show for sculpture Queen Kong, Cambridge Art Association National Prize Show, Robert Fitzpatrick, Pritzker Director of the Museum of Contemporary Art - Chicago, juror; Cambridge, MA, 2004 *Gold Medal for special exhibit The Root-Children (Die Wurdelkinder), New England Flower Show, Boston, MA, 2004 *Artist's Valentine Grant Competition winner for Barbie body of work, Nick Capasso, juror, Groton, MA, 2003 *Listed in Who's Who of American Women, 2002-7 editions; Who's Who in America, 2006-2007 *Silver Medal for special exhibit The Queen's Croquet-Grounds, New England Flower Show, Boston, MA, 2002 *Juror's Choice Award for acoustic sculpture Gravity Chimes, Cambridge Art Association SOUND juried show, 2001 *Cheryl di Mento Memorial Art History Essay Award for Louise Bourgeois, Framingham State College, 2001 *Distinguished Artist, Concord Art Association, 2001 *First prize for tabletop fountain Keep It Clean, Concord Art Association Members' Juried Show II, 2000 Articles and reviews *\\"Barbie and March Madness,\\" by Julia Spitz, Sculpture, March, 2009 *\\"Contemporary Sculptors at Chesterwood 2006,\\" by Marty Carlock, Sculpture, April, 2007 *\\"Artists 3,\\" by Chris Bergeron, Metrowest Daily News, October 8, 2006 *\\"Exhibitionist,\\" by Geoff Edgers, Boston.com, September 25, 2006 *\\"Cows Auctioned to boost the Jimmy Fund,\\" Boston Globe, September 22, 2006 *\\"Screwing with Barbie,\\" by Brita Belli, Fairfield County Weekly, July 13, 2006 *\\"Barbie as Art,\\" by Candace Taylor, Play, July 12, 2006 *\\"Plastic Princess,\\" by Donna Doherty, New Haven Register, July 15, 2006 *\\"Barbie's Bubble Burst?\\" by Adrienne LaFrance, WBUR.org Visual Arts, January 23, 2006 *\\"Role Model,\\" by Greg Cook, Boston Phoenix, December 16, 2005 *\\"Plastic Princess' Barbie has issues in this Exhibit,\\" by Joel Brown, Boston Globe, December 11, 2005 *\\"Raising The Barbie,\\" by Brigit Alverson, North Shore Sunday, December 4, 2005 *\\"This Barbie's not for kids,\\" by Rebecca Schoonmaker, Salem News, November 4, 2005 *\\"Go!

Nomenclature  This species has long been known by the name Mahonia lomariifolia, published by Takeda in 1917. Under that name, it was considered to occur only in mainland China, while on Taiwan, a second species was found, known as M. oiwakensis. Modern taxonomic sources unite the two as a single species, but as the latter name was published a year earlier by Hayata, it has priority and is thus the accepted name. In recognition of the morphological differences between the Taiwanese and mainland Chinese plants, Shaw recognized the two as subspecies of Mahonia oiwakensis: M. oiwakensis subsp. oiwakensis in Taiwan and M. oiwakensis subsp. lomariifolia in mainland China. In addition, a plant collected in Yunnan with especially narrow leaflets was described as a new variety: Mahonia oiwakensis subsp. lomariifolia var. tenuifoliola.  Description  Mahonia oiwakensis is a shrub or tree up to 7 m tall. Leaves are up to 45 cm long, compound with 12-20 pairs of leaflets plus a larger terminal one, dark green above, yellow-green below. The inflorescence is a fascicled raceme up to 25 cm long. The berries are egg- shaped, dark blue, sometimes almost black, up to 8 mm long.  Hybrids  Mahonia oiwakensis subsp. lomariifolia is one parent of the important garden hybrid Mahonia x media, which includes popular cultivars such as 'Charity', 'Winter Sun' and 'Lionel Fortescue' (the other parent is Mahonia japonica). It is also a parent of the cultivar 'Arthur Menzies', though with Mahonia bealei as the other parent. In the wild in Taiwan, M. oiwakensis subsp. oiwakensis appears to hybridize with wild Mahonia japonica. M. oiwakensis subsp. lomariifolia has gained the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit.

He is recognized for winning the Pan American title 2007 at junior flyweight. Yanez is best known for being a 2008 Olympian in Beijing. Amateur career Southpaw Yanez who hails from Duncanville, Texas was a hyperactive kid who was taken to the gym by his father in 1997 at the age of 8 when he had trouble getting his son to listen and settle down. He wanted him to receive structure, release energy in a positive environment and instill discipline. When Yanez was 14, he started compiling referrals from school administrators for disrupting class. After he had received 30 referrals, his coach Rodarte gave him an ultimatum to straighten up in school or he wouldn't be able to come to the gym. Yanez won a silver medal at the Cadet(U17) World Championships 2005 and a gold medal at the Junior Olympics. In 2006 he became US champion and won the National Golden Gloves, in 2007 he repeated both wins. In Brazil at the PanAm games 2007 he reached the final by beating two opponents who had beaten him earlier the same year – Cuba's Yampier Hernandez in the quarterfinals and Dominican Wilton Mendez in the semifinals and also bested Venezuelan Kevin Betancourt, ranked 58th in the world for the gold medal. He won the US Olympic trials in August 2007. Yanez didn't lose a fight in US Open competition, going 92-0. In the past three years, he's 26-3 in international competition. In August 2007, Yanez became the first boxer ever from Dallas, TX. to qualify for the Olympics. He was the third boxer from the Dallas/Ft. Worth area, behind Donald Curry and Sergio Reyes of Ft. Worth. At the 2007 World Amateur Boxing Championships in Chicago he qualified for the Olympics for good but lost surprisingly to fellow southpaw and eventual silver medalist Harry Tanamor from the Philippines. In November 2007, Yanez earned his ticket into the 2008 Olympics by \\"advancing to the quarterfinals of the AIBA World Championships in Chicago.\\" In a bout against Australia's Stephen Sutherland, the referee was forced to stop the fight in the second round after Yanez caused three standing eight counts. With this win, Yanez earned his official place as a light flyweight (106 pounds) in the 2008 Olympics to be hosted in Beijing, China. At the meeting in China in November 2007 he was soundly defeated by world champ Zou Shiming.Evan Osnos, \\"The Boxing Rebellion\\", The New Yorker, February 4, 2008, at page 7. On July 16, 2008 Yanez was reinstated to the U.S. Olympic team after having been removed to the team for missing three weeks of training camp in Colorado. On August 13, 2008 Yanez won his first bout against Kelvin de la Nieve of Spain. The final score recorded reflected Yanez in the lead, outscoring de la Nieve 12-9. Then he lost to eventual Mongolian runner-up Pürevdorjiin Serdamba 7:8. Professional career Following the 2008 Olympics, Yanez announced that he would turn professional. His first professional fight took place on Friday, February 20 versus Julio Cesar Valadez of San Antonio at the American Airlines Center in Dallas, Texas.

His usual position was as a forward, but he was equally adept at playing on the wing.  Career  McKee began his career at Manchester United, joining the club in 1989 after he was spotted playing for the Scotland schoolboys side. In 1992, he made the starting line-up for the FA Youth Cup final against Crystal Palace, along with future United stars such as Gary Neville, Nicky Butt, David Beckham and Ryan Giggs. United won the final 6–3 on aggregate, and McKee was offered a professional contract in August 1992. He went on loan to Bury for a month in January 1993, making two appearances for the Shakers. He returned to Manchester United, winning the Denzil Haroun Reserve Team Player of the Year award in 1993, but struggled to break into the first team, making only one appearance before being sold to Kilmarnock in September 1994 along with Neil Whitworth in a combined deal worth £350,000. On the creation of player squad numbers in the Premier League for the 1993–94 season, McKee was issued with the number 17 shirt, which became the property of the much more famous Andy Cole, who joined United from Newcastle four months after McKee's departure. McKee stayed at Kilmarnock for three years, his longest stay at any club. He made 78 appearances for the club – two in the Scottish Cup – and scored twelve goals, all of which came in the league. However, he was released by Kilmarnock in October 1997. Partick Thistle took him on a one-month trial in March 1998, but he failed to earn a contract with them and was allowed to leave. In June 1998, he signed for Falkirk, but only made four appearances for the club before being released yet again in October 1998. He spent the rest of the 1998–99 season with two clubs; first he signed for Queen of the South, where he made two appearances, and then he moved to Ross County on a free transfer, making one more appearance before finding himself unattached again. Summer 1999 saw McKee join his fifth club in two years when he put pen to paper for Stirling Albion, but yet again he made only two appearances before moving on to Queen's Park. He saw out the season with Queen's Park, making seven appearances for the Glasgow club, and then moved again, this time to Fauldhouse United. McKee retired from professional football soon after, calling time on a career that lasted twelve years and with ten clubs.

First published in Kadokawa Mystery, the series later (October 2006) transferred to the companion publication Shōnen Ace,Kurosagi Corpse Delivery Service Vol. 2 author's afterword. and now published in the magazine Young Ace. As of April 2016, 21 volumes have been published in Japan. An English adaptation was published by Dark Horse Comics until they ceased their release of the series past volume 17. The series follows five recently graduated university students who have formed a company which specializes in dealing with the dead and their last wishes. A U.S. live-action film based on The Kurosagi Corpse Delivery Service is in development.Dark Horse Comics > Profile > Kurosagi Corpse Delivery Service Vol. 6 TPB Plot, setting and structure The series deals with the exploits of five young graduates of a Buddhist college, all of which have a special skill, some of them supernatural and/or involving dead bodies. Most notable is Kuro Karatsu who has the ability to \\"speak\\" to the recently deceased and hear their last wishes. On this basis the group forms a business venture to fulfill said wishes in hopes for compensation. However, because corpses do not always die of natural causes or accidents, the group often encounters criminal activity or such compensation is unattainable. The series is ostensibly set in modern-day Japan with the main characters hanging around the Buddhist college near Tokyo the main characters attended, though the characters often travel elsewhere for summer jobs or to fulfill their \\"clients\\" wishes. Tokyo, usually Shinjuku, is often visited though it is not known exactly where the college is located in relation to the greater Tokyo metropolitan area. The manga also seems to be set in the same universe as MPD Psycho and Mail, other series that the authors Otsuka and Yamazaki respectively have worked on, as characters of these series appear in it. The Kurosagi Corpse Delivery Service is usually structured into self-contained chapters though some successive stories, most notably the entire second volume, are one continuous story. This changes in later volumes due to a change in serialization. The stories stay self-contained, but span two or three chapters which have fewer pages than chapters at the start of the series. Most chapters are named after a Japanese pop song with each chapter in a single volume usually named for songs by the same artist. The English release by Dark Horse Comics is notable for extensive translation notes and explanations in the back of the manga. An example would be information about the artists of the songs the chapters are named for. Starting with Volume 3 each volume of the manga features a structural drawing of a body on the cover that is relevant to one of the stories within. The cover and backcover also features a depiction of all the company members. However, only Karatsu gets a mugshot on each cover while the other characters may appear in some other manner or are hinted at. Above this depiction they are only identified as \\"Staff A\\" through \\"Staff E\\" (with the felt puppet Kere Ellis being \\"Staff E\\") and a description of their skill underneath. In the Japanese edition, the volumes come with a dust jacket using a paper stock similar to brown wrapping paper. Dark Horse attempted to emulate this cover style by using a similar stock for the cover of the English edition. However, starting with volume 12 Dark Horse switched to a glossier paper stock for cost cutting reasons. Characters =The Kurosagi Corpse Delivery Service= ; :A student Buddhist monk with average grades who shaves his head. He has the ability to \\"speak\\" with the recently deceased by the means of touching their bodies, allowing the team to learn their \\"clients'\\" desires. This skill develops over the course of the series and is linked to a spirit lingering near him named Yaichi. Involuntarily this can also lead to a temporary reanimation of the dead body touched and corpses in the immediate area, although Karatsu has no control over their actions afterwards. He is sometimes classified as an itako, although he is neither a woman nor blind. ; :The brains behind the company, a tall woman with long black hair. A skilled hacker and general computer expert. She also has a large information network and sometimes uses bribes (such as pictures of dead idols) as the means to achieve the ends. This includes running an Internet chat-room entitled \\"Corpse-Chat\\". Besides collecting pictures of dead bodies, she also seems to enjoy literature and has recently started to attend a few psychology courses at the university. ; :He uses a pendulum to dowse for the dead which enables him to find the bodies needed for the team's delivery work. Numata puts on a tough guy image including leather jackets and sunglasses, although he enjoys sides of Japanese pop culture which are rarely associated with such an image, such as interest in Japanese idol singers. He is the physically strongest of the group, but also tends to be the most emotional. ; :A timid guy who wears a felt puppet on his left hand which he claims channels an alien intelligence. He seems to be a big nerd even though it only rarely shows through. He is fond of advanced mathematics like Mandelbrot and Julia sets and his apartment is filled with various sci-fi and most notably Star Wars memorabilia. Like Sasaki, he is also fairly knowledgeable about literature and urban legends. Yata's eyes are rarely seen as his hair almost always covers them. ; :A very foul-mouthed alien life form which communicates through Yata's hand puppet, though the group is at least in the beginning very skeptical if this alien isn't Yata himself or a split personality express via ventriloquism. Yata often apologizes for Kere Ellis' unruly behavior and often has his left hand physically abused in reaction to the alien's verbal attacks. Kere Ellis' design changed significantly from the first chapter to the second but remained constant since. ; :A licensed embalmer who handles the corpses found by Karatsu and Numata. She studied her trade in America since embalmers are rare in Japan, where most bodies are cremated rather than buried. She has blonde hair and is very fashion conscious, never seen in the same outfit (often Punk fashion), and also works with her skills on part-time jobs, for example for on an American military base. ; :Yaichi is a spirit that seems to follow around Karatsu if not outright possessing him. He may be the source of Karatsu's ability or at least be able to amplify it to a great extent. The most notable of Yaichi's features are the severe scars on his face and his long white hair. One scar starts at the center-top of the face and runs down between the eyes and then down the right side. It is met below the eye by another scar coming from the right ear. A third scar runs across the left cheek starting from the corner of the mouth. Though there is no direct interaction or awareness with the group, he often helps the group with warnings or taking over some of the body movement of various characters who feel his presence during that period. =The Shirosagi Corpse Cleaning Service= The Shirosagi Corpse Cleaning Service is a mysterious organization that on the surface is in the business to clean up murder and suicide sites. However, it appears that they are secretly after Karatsu's spirit Yaichi. ; :This man has the same scars as Yaichi only his hair is black except for a patch white hair above his right eye. Sasayama remarked after giving a description that he looks very much like , a former police coroner and serial killer Sasayama shot when he was still a cop. However, Sasayama killed Zuhaku and also witnessed his burial and thus concludes that they can not be the same person. Sasayama also remarked that the name \\"Ichiro Suzuki\\" is probably fake. When conducting business as a corpse cleaner Suzuki wears a white jumpsuit, baseball cap, safety goggles and a breathing mask, obscuring his face almost completely. ;The Girl :A small, black-haired girl with a big bow in her hair usually wearing a kimono with a black leather Obi. Her character has not been named in the story so far. She seems to be Suzuki's partner in their more nefarious activities and possesses some spiritual powers of her own, e.g. limited Telekinetic powers and the ability to converse with a group of spirits. =Other recurring characters= ; :Sasayama is a character by Otsuka that also appeared in MPD Psycho. In this instance he is a lot older, has a large scar on his bald head and walks with cane due to a pegleg which is evidence for Kurosagi being set years after MPD Psycho. Initially the group thinks he is a Yakuza. He is no longer a police officer but instead works for the Shinjuku municipal social welfare office and often has trouble with unidentified bodies for which he asks the group for help, usually taking advantage of them. Also, he gives them odd jobs on occasion. ; :A nurse trainee with the ability to hear the last words of a spirit before it passes on. She has two separate encounters with the Kurosagi team and seems to be romantically interested in Karatsu. ; :Mr. Nire is an entrepreneur in post-mortem services. At times he has run a funeral home, a mummification service and a cryogenic preservation facility, though many of his business ventures are somewhat shady. He knew about the Kurosagi Corpse Delivery Service before they met and tried to recruit them for his business. ; :Mr. Nire's business partner in later exploits. He appears as a tall man usually in a hooded jacket. He is also covered in bandages which is explained by Mr. Nire as due to being a victim of an accident and having suffered severe burns. However, Shinuhe has also joked about being an actual resurrected Egyptian Mummy. Regardless of that, he seems to be fond of ancient Egypt either way and very knowledgeable about the process of mummification which he is eager to share. ;Mutsumi Nire :The adopted daughter of Mr. Nire. She has the unique ability to raise the dead for short periods of time, often with undesirable results. ;Reina Gorn :A forensic entomology student from America (Ohio, to be exact) that the group meets and befriends. Her unique accent makes speaking Japanese a bit awkward. She has a fascination with insects, as well. ;The crying woman :An unnamed elderly woman with the ability to affect other people around her and force them into involuntary crying. She appears to know about Yaichi and the Shirosagi Corpse Cleaning Service and is an acquaintance of Sasayama. ; :Sasaki's psychotherapist who occasionally is asked by the Kurosagis to help them with a case. She apparently chose psychiatry due to her failings in medicine and reluctance to work with the physical human body. Nevertheless, she seems to be unfazed by Karatsu's ability. Though young looking Sasaki stated that Jenny is as old as Sasayama.

He dedicated his career, as his father had done before him, to the service of the House of Lancaster, the ruling dynasty of England. Much of the Rempston family's fortunes were in fact owed to this. However, several ransoms contracted by Sir Thomas while campaigning in France, coupled with the fact that his long-living mother held many of his estates in dower, meant that he had to endure several financial difficulties for much of his life. Family Thomas was the son of Sir Thomas Rempston by his wife Margaret, daughter of Sir Simon Leeke. The Rempston family was an ancient Nottinghamshire family seated at Rempstone, since as early as the reign of Henry III of England. Life account In 1413 and again in 1416 he represented Nottinghamshire in parliament. Rempston at this time was impoverished due to a settlement made by his father in favour of his mother, which prompted him to seek fortune on the wars in France. In 1415 he was present at the battle of Agincourt with eight men-at-arms and twenty-four foot soldiers. In 1417 he was appointed High Sheriff of Flintshire and Constable of Flint Castle for life. In 1418 he served at the siege of Rouen, and on its fall was appointed captain of Bellencombre (Seine-Inferieure), which was subsequently bestowed on him by royal gift. On 22 Nov. 1419 he was promoted to the command of Meulan; he was also granted the town of Gassay, made third chamberlain to the Duke of Bedford, and steward of the king's household. In 1423 he took part in the battle of Cravant, and early in 1424 he went with John of Luxembourg to besiege Oisy in the Pas de Calais. After that fortress was taken he helped to besiege Guise in June of the same year. The garrison, however, did not surrender till early in 1425. Rempston then joined the Duke of Bedford in Paris. In January 1426, when war had been declared with Brittany, he took part in the raid into Brittany, penetrating as far as Rennes, and returning with the booty into Normandy. He fortified himself in St. James-de-Beuvron, near Avranches, which Richemont attacked in February. The besiegers were thrown into confusion by a successful sortie, and Richemont was forced to retreat to Rennes, leaving much spoil in the hands of the English. Rempston, joined two days later (8 March 1425 – 1426) by the Earl of Suffolk, pushed on to Dol, taking a fortified monastery by the way. Rempston held the barony of Gacé in Normandy. In 1427 he assisted Warwick in the reduction of Pontorson; the garrison capitulated on 8 May 1427. By this time the Duke of Brittany was sufficiently alarmed, and a truce was negotiated in May for three months, which was soon afterwards converted into a peace. Two years later, he was present at the siege of Orléans, and shortly after he joined the force under Sir John Fastolf which went to the relief of Beaugency, Waurin, the chronicler, being in the army. Setting out from Paris, they were joined at Janville by Scales and Talbot, and Rempston took part in the council of war, in which, contrary to Fastolf's advice, it was decided to advance. In the battle of Patay (18 June 1429) which followed he was one of the commanders, and was taken prisoner by Taneguy du Chatel (one of the murderers of John the Fearless in 1419). He remained in prison until 1435, and a curious petition contains the terms of his ransom. He was shortly afterwards appointed seneschal of Guienne, and in that capacity won much popularity at Bordeaux. He took part in the siege of Tartas in 1440, under the Earl of Huntingdon. St. Sever (1442), which saw Rempston captured On late January 1441, with the siege of Tartas still ongoing, the English obtained terms for a conditional surrender: the town would capitulate if a French relief force failed to show up before 25 June 1442. Notably, Rempston also agreed with the Lord of Albret, to whom the viscounty of Tartas belonged, that if this deadline wasn't met by the French, Albret would also switch his allegiance, thus placing all of his lands under suzerainty of the English in southwestern France. This would have been disastrous for Charles VII, who would see large amounts of land in Gascony suddenly pass to enemy control, and so he mounted an expedition, the \\"Journée de Tartas\\", to relieve the town. The French arrived on 24 June 1442; the English were vastly outnumbered (receiving little or no support from England as efforts were focused on the defense of Normandy) and withdrew, thus the agreement came to nothing. On 8 August 1441 he made a treaty with the counts of Penthièvre and Beaufort, by which all their possessions near Guienne were to be neutral for four years. He was taken prisoner when the dauphin took St. Sever in 1442, after the 'Journee de Tartas', but regained his liberty, and retook St. Sever, which the French in turn recaptured. He died on 15 October 1458, and was buried in Bingham church, where there existed an alabaster monument to him in Thoroton's time. He married Alice, daughter of Thomas Bekering, and by her had: 1. Elizabeth (b. 1418), wife of John, afterwards Sir John Cheney; 2. Isabel, wife of Sir Brian Stapleton; 3. Margery, wife of Richard Bingham the younger. Both the Bingham and the Rempston estates afterwards passed to the Stapleton family.

The toys were made of plastic, with many featuring a signature action move based on their real life counterpart. Benefiting for being introduced during a sports entertainment boom period, these figures were among the most popular sports entertainment action figures of their time, and have since become collectors items. In good condition, an unopened figure can be viewed as being valued from anywhere between $20 to $1–2 thousand. This is a result of the production of variant figures produced in smaller numbers and limited time mailaway promotions. Much of the collection has been released on foreign (usually French or Spanish) cards, and are of far less value than cards that are all in English writing, due to their abundance. For example, a 1992 Ultimate Warrior Mint on an American Card can fetch upwards of $250–$300 US, while exactly the same figure on a French card may get around $50–$70 However, a very limited number of Hasbro action figures were released on a dual card (mainly being US/French) these figures have been seen to fetch in the region of $1000 per figure. Dusty Rhodes, Brutus Beefcake, Rick Rude, Roddy Piper, Mr. Perfect, Hulk Hogan, Macho King, Koko B. Ware and The Rockers are known examples.

In an ad promoting a Toys R Us and WWE partnership in the March 1991 WWE Magazine, tag team sets of Demolition, the Bushwhackers, the Rockers, and Rhythm and Blues appeared. The Rhythm and Blues set was never released, however both the Honky Tonk Man and Greg \\"The Hammer\\" Valentine did see singles action figures released. Honky Tonk Man, as he appeared in the ad, was released in Series 2, however Valentine's figure in the advertisement appeared in his Rhythm and Blues attire, black hair, white jacket with black musical notes on it, white boots, and black trunks, whereas the figure released of Valentine in Series 3 was in his most regular singles attire of blond hair, black trunks and yellow boots. Fueling further collector speculation is the fact that on the back of some early foreign card figures, Rhythm and Blues was listed as an available tag team set. The exact reason this figure went unreleased is unknown, but it is assumed that it was due to the tag team breaking up a few months before the ad was printed. The Rhythm and Blues Greg Valentine was a hot topic among WWE Hasbro collectors because it was one of the few prototypes that had not turned up in a private collection. The figure has since been found and auctioned off via eBay for $13,400. Collector Matt Cera purchased the figure, after being sent a text message by WWE wrestler Zack Ryder, who initially had the highest bid on the figure and has since spent a total of $15,000 getting the figure insured and appraised. The figure is said to have been found in the attic of a former Hasbro employee. Valentine himself has increased speculation on the whereabouts of the figure, giving conflicting reports as to where the prototype(s) may be in various interviews. Other unreleased prototypes that have appeared in print include Brutus \\"The Barber\\" Beefcake in red and yellow attire meant to replicate his Mega Maniacs attire from WrestleMania IX to be in the Purple Carded set. He is believed to have been replaced by a Tatanka re-release from Series 6 due to his departure from the company. Shawn Michaels' Yellow Carded figure appeared in both print ads and on card backings using the spring-loaded armed feature found on the Virgil, Jake \\"The Snake\\" Roberts, El Matador, Hulk Hogan # 4, Papa Shango, Ted DiBiase # 3 and Billy Gunn but was changed to his released form. Randy Savage from Series 1 appeared in the 1991 J.C. Penney catalog in green trunks as part of an offer selling a ring and both Hulk Hogan and Savage action figures. Savage was sent out in his regularly released orange trunks. Both Shawn Michaels and Razor Ramon figures resembling those released on both Yellow and Blue cards have appeared in an unreleased print ad promoting the figures as mail-aways as a reward for collecting Hasbro points found on the back of the WWE Hasbro cards. Hasbro had plans to release an Ultimate Warrior figure with chest beating action. It is not known exactly why this figure wasn't made. Speculation is that it was never finished because Warrior had already left WWE or because Hasbro was unable to perfect the chest beating action. A prototype image of this figure can be found online. The figure has the same head as Warrior #2 and the body used is the same body used for the Demolition Smash figure. The figure was to use a new set of arms in order to have the figure beat its chest Hasbro had plans to release a Tugboat figure. The plan for this figure can be found online. The figure was cancelled because Tugboat turned heel and switched his name to Typhoon. The Tugboat figure's head and body would have been similar to the Typhoon figure but would have featured his Tugboat attire. There were plans for a Jim the Anvil Neidhart figure in Hart Foundation attire with the same head sculpt as the Anvil that was released. These plans can be found online as well. It is believed that this figure would've been released in a 2 pack along with Bret Hart (same figure as his first Hasbro release) and would've been in the same series as the Nasty Boys and the Legion of Doom. The Hart Foundation set was cancelled because the team broke up and Bret started a singles career. In 1993, Hasbro developed concept art for a series of 12 inch tall WWE figures, that would've included removable fabric clothing, similar to their popular G.I. Joe: Hall of Fame series, even sharing the body molds with the G.I. Joe figures. To date, the only concept art that has surfaced form this line is of Randy Savage. There were plans for another mail away series in 1994. The figures planned were Shawn Michaels and Razor Ramon. It believed that they wouldn't have been new molds but re-releases with possibly different colored outfits. Before the WWE canceled their deal with Hasbro there were plans for a series 12 on orange cards. There have even been prototype pictures online of the heads and artist sketches for this series. According to the sketches found, the series was to include: Lex Luger (in USA gear), Mo and Mabel from Men on a Mission, Jeff Jarrett, Bastion Booger (which would have reused the body of Earthquake), a repaint of the first Doink, and Diesel. Modifications from prototypes * Series 1 saw only one change in the line when compared to the press photo shots of the prototypes; Hulk Hogan's shirt features a different font than the one that appeared on the final product. * Series 2 featured the unreleased Greg Valentine as well as a minor adjustment to Dusty Rhodes' expression. * Series 3 featured the Ultimate Warrior with yellow and white face paint on the prototype instead of yellow, purple, and white as he was released and the Texas Tornado with red and white tassels on the prototype instead of all red like how his figure was released. * Series 4's only change was Bret Hart's figure, who went from having silver and pink shades to only pink. * Series 5's Mountie prototype had a red cattle prod instead of the released black cattle prod and added Virgil's name to his trunks. * Series 6's Berzerker originally came with no cloak and a 2x4 accessory and Tatanka originally had blue script on his legs * Series 7 featured Kamala with a moon on his stomach as a pre-production variant but not in the promotional photo. The only changes made from the promotional photo were that of Owen Hart's final baggy pants and Shawn Michaels was changed from his original action of that of the Jake Roberts, Hulk Hogan # 4, Virgil, Papa Shango, El Matador, Ted DiBiase # 3 and Billy Gunn figures to Conceited Crush! action and a plastic gold chain was added to Razor Ramon when released (who also had no stubble). * Series 8 featured Bret Hart with Black elbow pads and Black stars on his boots and back of the trunks as a pre-production variant. Otherwise no major changes from the prototype images. * Series 9 featured changes to three figures. The original Rick Steiner prototype featured two differently designed boots, the original Doink the Clown design featured green pants with red stars, and Brutus \\"The Barber\\" Beefcake was originally slated to be in the line, but was replaced by a re-release of Series 6's Tatanka. * Series 10 saw no major changes from the prototype images. * Series 11 saw no major changes from the prototype images. Popular belief holds that a Dusty Rhodes figure has yellow boots as a variant. While these figures have been photographed, debate continues on whether they are the product of sun damage. Commonly-traded error cards and variants Series 3's Sgt. Slaughter is a popular variant, offering a variant that features no name listed on the front of the card. This variant is very rare and is believed to have seen limited release in the Tri-State Region. Some of the more common error cards include \\"Rowdy\\" Roddy Piper on a Series 2 Ultimate Warrior card, Billy Gunn on a Bart Gunn card, Bart Gunn on a Billy Gunn card, Giant Gonzalez on a Samu card, and Series 1 Ted DiBiase on a Rick Rude card.

The group debuted with 1998's The Chinkees Are Coming!, and followed with 1999's Peace Through Music and 2002's Searching for a Brighter Future before a greatest hits album was released in 2003. According to the liner notes for the band's debut album The Chinkees Are Coming!, the music was recorded by members of the band Tuesday with vocals provided by Mike Park. Subsequent albums were recorded all or in part by members Park, Miya Osaki, Greg Alesandro, Jason Thinh, and Steve Choi, as well as \\"guest\\" musicians, including Slapstick and Tuesday drummer Rob Kellenberger and Link 80's Steve Borth, often with members trading and playing different instruments than listed. All of the members were involved with the ska/punk scene. Jason Thinh was from the band Short Round, Miya was a member of the Santa Cruz punk trio The Muggs, Greg Alesandro a member of San Jose band Statue Man, and Steve Choi later becoming a keyboardist and guitarist for Rx Bandits in 1999. After the \\"Chinkees Are Coming\\" album was released in 1998, the newly recruited members of The Chinkees headed for some warm up dates in Mexico supporting Riverside punks Voodoo Glow Skulls and San Diego's Buck-O-Nine before going on their first tour of Japan in 1999, supporting Japanese ska punk legends Kemuri. After a short stint on the west coast with fellow Asian Man Records recording artists MU330 and the then up and coming Alkaline Trio, the band again headed to Japan in the spring of 2000 with label mates MU330, and Tokyo ska punks Potshot. Europe was next as the band took part in a summer 2000 tour dubbed \\"Monsters of Ska\\" with Link 80 and MU330. 2001 saw another Japanese tour, again in support of Potshot, as well as Detroit's Suicide Machines, followed the next year by a UK tour with Potshot, and the UK band Lightyear, which proved to be the last major undertaking of the band as it has remained on hiatus ever since. Recently, there have been a few reunions by the Chinkees in 2010 and 2011, as well as playing at the Punks in Vegas concert in May 2013. In 2020, they released a new four song EP, \\"K.A.

In early December 1950, communist force consisted of a regiment of the communist Longzhou Military Sub-District, the communist 129th Division and the communist 134th Division were tasked to eradicate the nationalists in the region. The original communist plan of attacking on December 20, 1950 was forced to be carried out early on December 13, 1950 when the intelligence revealed that the nationalists planned to withdrew to Vietnam. After three days of travel, the communists succeeded in besieging the nationalist within the Chinese border. The nationalists attempt a futile breakout by sending out a small force to sneak out of the encirclement and cross the border, but the entire 80 member strong force was annihilated by the communist regiment of the Longzhou Military Sub-District in the region to the north of Jiute (九特). The remaining nationalists attempted to flee eastward, but they were annihilated by the enemy at the Taiping (太平) Mountain region. The battles afterward became eradication operations on small scales.

He was the favorite for the 1996 Kentucky Derby but injured himself before the race and finished fifth. He finished his racing career with five wins from twelve starts and earnings of $1.3 million. He subsequently became a highly successful sire, with major winners including Breeders' Cup champions Arrogate, Forever Unbridled, Midshipman and Liam's Map. He was posthumously the leading sire in North America of 2017. Background Unbridled's Song was a gray stallion who was bred in Kentucky by Mandysland Farm. He was sired by 1990 Kentucky Derby winner Unbridled, whose other important offspring included Derby winner Grindstone, Preakness winner Red Bullet and Belmont Stakes winner Empire Maker. His dam, Trolley Song, is a winning daughter of Caro out of Lucky Spell, a stakes winner and stakes producer. Unbridled's Song was sold as a yearling in 1994 for $200,000 to Ernie Paragallo who then \\"pinhooked\\" the horse as a two-year-old in training for a world record $1.4 million. However, the high bidder returned the colt after his veterinarian detected a bone chip, a claim disputed by Paragallo. Unbridled's Song subsequently raced for Paragallo's Paraneck Stable. At maturity, he reached high. He was trained for most of his career by Jim Ryerson before being handed over to Nick Zito for his final two starts. Racing career Unbridled's Song made his racing debut on August 26, 1995 as the odds-on favorite in a maiden special weight race at Saratoga. He went to the early lead then drew off in the stretch to win \\"handily\\" by lengths. He was then stepped up to Grade I stakes company in the Champagne Stakes on October 7 in which he finished fourth behind Maria's Mon. He made his final start as a two-year-old in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile where he was the second choice in a strong field of 13. He broke poorly and experienced traffic problems on the first turn before moving into contention down the backstretch. He started his drive on the final turn and battled Hennessy down the stretch, winning by a neck in a time of 1:41:60. The next spring, after placing second in the Hutcheson Stakes and the Fountain of Youth Stakes, he beat the 1996 U.S. Champion 3-Yr-Old Colt Skip Away, along with Louis Quatorze and Editor's Note in the Florida Derby. Then, a couple of weeks before the Kentucky Derby, he won the Wood Memorial, but in doing so, he hit himself in the left forefoot, causing a \\"quarter crack\\", or cracked hoof, requiring a special bar shoe and acrylic patch. He was the favorite for the 1996 Kentucky Derby but placed a troubled fifth behind Grindstone. The forefoot injury from the Wood Memorial kept him out of the rest of the Triple Crown races. Three weeks after the Kentucky Derby, he was second in the Peter Pan Stakes. Six weeks later, he ran ninth in the Arlington Citation Challenge Invitational, a race that was specially created for Cigar. In his only race at four, he won the Olympic Handicap.  Retirement  Unbridled's Song was retired to stud in 1997. He became one of the most successful sires in the United States of America and abroad, with Grade I winners and $1 million winners. He stood at Taylor Made Farms and his 2010 fee was $100,000 live foal. Some of his most famous offspring include Breeders' Cup Classic winner Arrogate, Breeders' Cup Distaff winners Forever Unbridled, Unbridled Elaine and Unrivaled Belle, Breeders' Cup Juvenile winner Midshipman and Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile winner Liam's Map. Other graded stakes winners include Will Take Charge, Octave, Splendid Blended, Domestic Dispute, Grey Song, Alexander, Political Force, Eurosilver, Eight Belles, Old Fashioned, Buddha and Songandaprayer. Dunkirk, though not a graded stakes winner, finished second in the Belmont Stakes in 2009. An important sire milestone came on February 10, 2013 when his son Graydar won the Grade 1 Donn Handicap, his 100th stakes winner. After his death, his sons Will Take Charge (2013) and Arrogate (2016) both won the Travers Stakes,http://cs.bloodhorse.com/blogs/horse-racing-steve- haskin/archive/2016/08/28/baffert-forever-linked-to-unbridled-s-song.aspx and Arrogate then won the Breeders' Cup Classic the same year. He died on July 26, 2013, at age of 20 years after a large and inoperable mass was discovered in his sinus cavities and around the optic nerves. The horse began showing acute neurological symptoms and was euthanized. Unbridled's Song was the leading sire in North America of 2017, thanks mainly to Arrogate's victories that year in the world's two richest horse races, the Pegasus World Cup and the Dubai World Cup.

Intended to equip the French Navy, only a single prototype was completed before the German invasion of France stopped production. That prototype did, however serve operationally from bases in French North Africa until scrapped in 1943. Development and design The Potez-CAMS 141 was designed by Chantiers Aéro-Maritimes de la Seine (or CAMS, which since 1933 had been part of Potez) to meet a 1935 French Navy specification for a long range marine reconnaissance flying boat to replace obsolete aircraft such as the Breguet Bizerte, competing against the Latécoère 611 and Breguet 730. The prototype first flew on 21 January 1938 at Caudebec-en-Caux, starting official trials in August 1938. It was a four engined monoplane, powered by Hispano- Suiza 12Y engines, with a braced, high aspect ratio wing mounted above the fuselage and a twin tail. It was armed with a dorsal turret carrying two 7.5 mm Darne machine guns, with a further two machine guns in lateral \\"cheek\\" barbettes and two in waist positions. After evaluation, a production order for four aircraft was placed, with a further 15 being ordered before the start of the Second World War. Operational history The prototype, named Antarès, entered service with Escadrille E8 of the French Navy in September 1939, flying its first patrol mission over the Atlantic on 20 September 1939. Additional large orders for Potez-CAMS 141s were placed shortly after the start of the war, with delivery expected from June 1940, but these orders were cut back owing to changing priorities and the realisation that the loss rate of long range flying boats was very low. No production aircraft had been completed by the time of the Armistice in June 1940, with Antarès being evacuated to Port Lyautey in Morocco. It was operated by the Vichy French Navy, serving with Escadrille 4E at Dakar, continuing in service until the Allied Invasion of North Africa, when after brief fighting, the French armed forces in North Africa joined with the Free French. Antarès continued in service, carrying out patrols over the Central and South Atlantic. On 2 June 1943, Antarès sank the near Dakar. Antarès was retired and scrapped early in 1944.

It is a distrust or a dislike of products from a particular brand on the basis of past experiences with that brand and its products, similar to taste aversion. Brand aversion can be the effect of obtrusive marketing strategies, bad press, a mass product recall, or other poor product launches. Psychologically, the reasons for brand aversion have been explained by the attachment-aversion model using the same three dimensions (\\"3 Es\\") that characterize a product: #enticing/annoying the self #enabling/disabling the self and #enriching/impoverishing the self (benefits/liabilities). The more annoying/disabling/impoverishing a brand \\"feels\\", the more aversion will be produced and vice versa. As is the case with all brands, the conceived qualities need neither correspond to real assets nor shortcomings.

Released in February 1974 by Columbia and Windfall Records, it contains recordings from the band's performance at Koseinenkin Hall in Osaka, Japan on August 30, 1973. The album was produced by the band's bassist and second vocalist Felix Pappalardi, while the artwork was created by his wife and collaborator Gail Collins. It was Mountain's first release since returning after a year-long hiatus. After breaking up for a year in the summer of 1972, Mountain returned with new members Bob Mann (guitar, keyboards) and Allan Schwartzberg (drums) joining Leslie West and Felix Pappalardi. The material for Twin Peaks was recorded on the subsequent Japanese tour, after which the new members left and original drummer Corky Laing returned. The album charted at number 142 on the US Billboard 200, which was the lowest position achieved by the band up to that point. Background Mountain broke up in the summer of 1972, shortly after releasing its first live album Live: The Road Goes Ever On earlier in the year. Within a year the band had reunited, with original members Leslie West (guitar, vocals) and Felix Pappalardi (bass, vocals) joined by new members Bob Mann (guitar, keyboards) and Allan Schwartzberg (drums). The resulting Japanese tour – specifically, the August 30 performance at Koseinenkin Hall in Osaka – spawned the recordings for Twin Peaks, the group's second consecutive live album. The album is the only Mountain release to feature Mann and Schwartzberg, both of whom left shortly after the tour. Twin Peaks was released in February 1974. It was issued as the band's first album with Columbia Records, in tandem with its regular label Windfall Records. By the time the album was released, original drummer Corky Laing had returned to Mountain, alongside new guitarist David Perry. Reception Upon its release, Twin Peaks debuted at number 166 on the US Billboard 200 albums chart in the week of March 9, 1974. The album spent a total of eight weeks on the chart, peaking at number 142 in the week of March 30, 1974. This marked the lowest peak position of any Mountain release to that date, and remains the second lowest ahead of only Go for Your Life at number 166. Twin Peaks also peaked at number 138 on the US Cash Box magazine albums chart. Reviewing the album for the website AllMusic, James Chrispell offered a mixed opinion of Twin Peaks. Awarding it two out of five stars – the same rating he gave to Live: The Road Goes Ever On – the writer claimed that \\"The content [on the album] ends up showing off the best and the worst attributes of Mountain\\", the latter of which he singled out as being the 32-minute rendition of \\"Nantucket Sleighride\\" (although he admitted that \\"it's difficult not to be impressed with the playing\\" on the track).

It is commonly found along coastal towns or travel routes in Southeast Asia. \\"Also found in Peninsular Thailand, South Sulawesi and in Phillippines on South coast of Mindanao, in Sulu Archipelago and neighboring islands\\". \\"It is a well known fruit tree commonly cultivated in villages throughout Southeast Asia\\". M. odorata has a skin that is yellow to green in colour. The flesh of the fruit has an orange to yellow colour and is sour or sweet when eaten. The fruits are round in shape and have a smooth skin that range from yellow-green. The flesh of the fruit has an orange to yellow colour and is sour or sweet when eaten. The tree flowers have a pleasant fragrance.The fruits are round or oblong in shape and have a skin that ranges from yellow-green.  Description  alt= = Morphology = Mangifera odorata is a fruit plant that grows approximately 10-15 m in height, hardly ever growing past 20 m. The crown has a wide round shape. The trunk stands in an upright straight position that appears to have a grayish colour \\"containing and irritant sap\\". Leaf morphology is \\"oblong-lance shaped\\" that has a \\"non-wavy edge\\". Veins are also noticeable on the leaf. The plant has flowers are approximately 6 mm wide, emit a pleasant scent as well as appear to be yellowish-green in colour. The rachis has a reddish-brown colour. Petals are lance-shaped and at the base have a yellowish colour but turn dark red later on. The apex or tip of the petal is pale pink in colour. The sepals which appear to be brown-red or partly green in colour look oval shaped and are roughly 3-4 mm long. Within the flower, there is 1 fertile stamen that serve in reproduction and is about 5 mm in length. The staminodes which are approximately 1.5-2 mm long. Another reproductive organ called the ovary is round in shape, yellowish to dark red and about 3-5 mm in length. The pollen is \\"elliptic and tapering towards poles\\" left The fruit has a yellow to green skin colour. When it is ripe the skin turns green. The flesh is orange to yellow and can taste sweet or source when consumed. The seed inside is both flat in shape with a hairy/fibrous surface. = Origin and Distribution = Mangifera odorata exact origins are unknown. However, the species represents a hybrid between Mangifera indica known as the Indian mango and Mangifera foetida which is known as the horse mango. M.odorata is native to tropical Asia and can be found in areas such as Philippines, Peninsular Thailand, South Sulawesi, Sulu Archipelago and other close islands\\". \\"In Southeast Asia it is an introduced species\\".  Habitat  Mangifera odorata thrive to grow in tropical wet climates which have both heavy and moderate rainfall. However, they are unable to survive and grow in places that have continuous dry climates. M. odorata is common in cultivation but is not normally grown in the wild. = Pests = Mangifera odorata is known to be a major host of Bactrocera dorsalis, Ciripestis eutraphera, Coptotermes, Coptotermes cuvignathus, Cryptorhynchus frigidus, Deanolis albizonalis, Marasmiellus scandens and Marasmius crinis-equi.  Food/Nutrition  M.odorata is a fruit which can be consumed. While it can be consumed in its raw form, the fruit is usually made or incorporated into something else such as chutneys. M. odorata fruit pulp is also a good source of nutrition. When M.odorata has not reached maturity, its pulp is a good source for \\"dietary fibre, vitamin C, vitamin E\\". The mature pulp is good to eat because of \\"protein, ash, fat, soluble carbohydrate and B vitamin\\". The fruit's seed kernel is \\"rich in fat, protein, carbohydrate, and ash\\". The peel or skin is a great source of \\"fibre, minerals, β-Carotene and ascorbic acid\\".

Presenters who later achieved wider public recognition included Roger Scott, Adrian Love, Steve Allen, Nicky Horne, Graham Dene and Dale Winton. The first Programme Director, when the station opened in 1970, was Neil Spence the former Radio London DJ known as Dave Dennis.Billboard, 30 April 1977 Because there were few non-BBC radio stations in the 1970s, the network became notable in breaking new acts. It was closed in 1979, when the decision was taken to play Independent Local Radio stations in the factories instead. The Chris Petit film Radio On was partly filmed at the UBN studio. The protagonist is a DJ at an industrial radio station similar to UBN. Distribution of the 'radio' from the Osterley studios to the various factories was via GPO landlines, then 100 V loudspeaker systems in each factory. Each pair of workers had their own loudspeaker and volume control. To accommodate the already high ambient noise levels in the factories, the audio was highly compressed. UBN's programme content was similar to contemporary commercial radio, except that 'commercials' were to encourage safe work practice, among other subjects, and music requests were, for example, from Fred on the Chocolate Digestive line to Doris on the Jaffa Cakes.

Club career =Spain= Born in Málaga, Andalusia, Nano spent the vast majority of his first six years as a senior in the lower leagues and amateur football, representing UD Fuengirola Los Boliches, UD Marbella, FC Barcelona B, Córdoba CF, UE Lleida and FC Cartagena. The exception to this occurred during the 2005–06 season, when he totalled only 198 minutes in the Segunda División for Gimnàstic de Tarragona to help them promote to La Liga. Nano returned to the second level in the 2009–10 campaign, being relatively played by Cádiz CF but suffering team relegation. He scored his first goal as a professional on 4 October 2009, in a 1–0 away win against Albacete Balompié. After two years back in division three, with Real Oviedo, Nano returned to the second tier by signing with SD Ponferradina. He only missed one game in 42 in his first and only season, adding two goals to help the club avoid relegation one year after promoting. =Panathinaikos= In the 2013 summer, after refusing to show up for training, Nano joined Panathinaikos F.C. from Greece. He made his debut in top flight football on 18 August of that year, featuring the full 90 minutes in a 2–0 home success over Panetolikos F.C. for the Superleague and converting a three-minute penalty kick in the process.

Mangifera zeylanica or “Sri Lanka wild mango” is a wild species of mango tree endemic to Sri Lanka. This stately tree is the tallest member of the mango genus, Mangifera, and one of the two tallest trees in the family Anacardiaceae. The mango fruits are edible and have an excellent taste. It is called \\"aetamba\\" (ඇටඹ) or \\"wal amba\\" in Sinhala and “kaddu-ma” in Tamil. The well-known British botanist and explorer Joseph Dalton Hooker first described the tree in 1876. Large tree in Udawattakele Forest Description Mangifera zeylanica is a large, stately, slow growing, evergreen tree that can grow up to 35 meter tall. The trunk is straight, up to 90 cm in diameter, and is free of buttresses. Bark in older trees is rough, deeply fissured, with strips 2–3 cm wide, and dark to light brown. The inner bark is orange brown. The wood is greyish white, soft, and coarsely grained. The dark green leaves are stiffly coriaceous, glabrous, and emit a mango aroma when damaged. The leaves are scattered, partly aggregating at the end of twigs. In shape they are spathulate or obovate-oblong or oblanceolate, from 1.5 x 4 to 5 x 16 cm, usually 3 x 9 cm, tapering towards the base, with a rounded apex in adult trees and with a pointed 7–13 cm apex in saplings. The margins are slightly incurved and narrowly decurrent at the base along the petiole. The midrib is raised on both leaf surfaces. Nerves: Lateral nerves 7 to 14 pairs. Petiole slender, 1–3 cm. Panicles glabrous, erect, up to 20 cm long, terminal. Flowers whitish and cream yellow coloured, 5–merous, 4 mm across, not glomerulate. Bracteoles lanceolate, minute, caducous. Pedicel slender, 1 mm. Petals twice as long as sepals. Sepals 5, ovate, acute, 2 x 1.5 mm. Petals 5, elliptic, 3.5 x 2 mm. Disc large, cushion- like, with 5 globose lobes. 1 fertile stamen (rarely 2), 2 mm long. The ripe fruit is yellowish in colour and with a red flush. It has the shape of a mango, ovoid, slightly flattened, with a small beak, up to 6.5 x 5 x 4 cm, and a thin skin. When ripe, which is when it falls of the tree, it is very juicy and fluid with soft, thin, fibres. The yellow pulp has a pleasant sweet taste, but is slightly acid when unripe. Hard endocarp with longitudinal veins, 5 x 2.5 by 3 x 12 cm. Distribution It mainly grows in forests of the intermediate and wet zones up to 800 metres, but can also be found in the Dry Zone along waterways and in moist valley areas. It occurs at low population densities, scattered here and there in forests, and, like many native plants, is declining in unprotected areas. Uses The fruit is eaten by villagers. The soft wood has been used for making tea cases and the like. The tree is not cultivated, but could be used for crossing and improving mango varieties and as a rootstock.

Photo by Jane Traum. Born and raised in the Bronx, Traum became a part of the Greenwich Village folk music scene in the late 1950s. Early on, Traum co-wrote songs for the Brian De Palma debut film Greetings – the first role for Robert De Niro – with Eric Kaz and Bear. 1969 saw Traum joining forces with his brother Happy Traum in a duo. Their self-titled debut album, Happy & Artie Traum (Capitol Records) was cited by the New York Times as \\"one of the best records in any field of pop music.\\" The Traums were managed by Albert Grossman (manager of The Band, Dylan, Janis Joplin, etc.). The duo performed at the 1969 Newport Folk Festival on stage with James Taylor, Kris Kristofferson and Joni Mitchell. Happy Traum and Artie Traum in 1970. In November 1971, both Artie and Happy Traum (together with Bob Dylan, David Amram, and others) participated in an extended Record Plant (NYC) session backing up Allen Ginsberg in various songs and chants. Ginsberg wrote the liner notes for the duo's Hard Times in the Country LP. Reviewing the LP in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: \\"If you're a sucker for folkie nonsense—ramblin' mythopoeia, articulated sentiment, purty tunes—you might as well buy it from real folkies on a real, struggling folkie label. Bonus: 'Gambler's Song,' Artie's uncharacteristically ironic tale of anomie, which ought to be recorded by somebody who'll get it heard.\\" During the 1970s and 1980s, Artie Traum produced The Woodstock Mountains Revue featuring himself, his brother Happy, Roly Salley Pat Alger, John Sebastian, Arlen Roth, Maria Muldaur, Rory Block, Eric Andersen, Paul Butterfield and Paul Siebel. In the mid-1980s Traum teamed up with singer/songwriter Pat Alger (Thunder Rolls, Unanswered Prayers). The duo recorded the album From The Heart. Traum released his first solo album, Life on Earth, in 1977 on Rounder Records. Traum's 1994 release - the jazz project Letters From Joubee - captured #1 on the Smooth Jazz Radio Charts (Gavin AA chart). In 1999 his Meetings With Remarkable Friends - which included tracks featuring Traum playing with The Band, Bela Fleck, Jay Ungar, and other notables - received the Best Acoustic Instrumental Album award from the NAV. In 2003, Traum released a singer/songwriter project, South of Lafayette, which was featured on NPR's \\"All Things Considered\\". In 2007 Traum released the album Thief of Time. During recent years, Traum enjoyed a small side career as a documentary filmmaker. In 2002, his film Deep Water: Building the Catskill Water System (co-produced and co-directed with Tobe Carey and Robbie Dupree) was featured at the Woodstock Film Festival. Two years later, in 2004, Traum co-produced Hudson River Journeys: A Celebration of America's First River for WMHT Public Television. The latter film featured artist Len Tantillo and folksinger Pete Seeger. Traum also wrote numerous guitar instruction books, and hosted many video productions for his brother Happy's Homespun Music Instruction. Traum lived with his wife Beverly in Bearsville, New York, just outside Woodstock. At the time of his death, Traum had been at work on a memoir.

It is located north-northeast of the town of Windermere. The reservoir is fed by the streams which form the headwaters of the River Kent which rise to the north in Hall Cove on the southern slopes of a mountainous ridge called High Street, which is named after the nearby Roman road. It is also fed by Lingmell Gill, which drains the large corrie on the western side of Harter Fell beneath the Nan Bield Pass. After Kentmere Tarn was drained to provide agricultural land in the 1840s, water supply to the mills further downstream became erratic, and the mill owners met to plan a reservoir to regulate the flow. They employed the water engineer John Frederick Bateman to advise, and the Act of Parliament obtained in 1845 authorised five reservoirs. Despite Bateman's preference for the reservoir at Skeggles Water, the millers opted to build that at Kentmere Head, which was completed in 1848, but cost a lot more than estimated. Millers paid for the water based on the drop in river level at their mill, with small mills exempt from charges. Soon after its completion, cheap coal became available, as railways arrived in the area, and the number of mills using water power steadily declined. This process was exacerbated by the Water Resources Act 1963, under which the Lancashire River Authority levied prohibitive charges for using water to generate power. The use of water power effectively ceased in 1972, with James Cropper becoming the owner of the reservoir, as the paper mills at Burneside were the last user of water from the reservoir. By 1995 there were serious problems with the dam, and there was talk of breaching the dam, so that it would no longer be subject to the provisions of the Reservoir (Safety Provisions) Act 1930. However, there was public outcry, because the reservoir is in an area of natural beauty, and despite not needing the water, Croppers paid for engineering work to remedy the faults, resulting in a slightly lower maximum water level, and a wall being constructed along the top of the dam to prevent wave action causing the downstream face to erode and possibly fail. History Prior to 1800 most of the land around Kentmere was unenclosed common land, but at that time farms began to be bought by wealthy people from outside the area. They set about enclosing the land and improving the farms that they now owned. Lime from a quarry located above Kentmere Hall was used to condition the soil, and field drains were added to make the land more suitable for agriculture. The Wilsons, who owned Kentmere Hall, drained Kentmere Tarn in the 1830s, hoping that the reclaimed land would be of good quality. However, these alterations to the landscape had unexpected consequences for the mill owners further downstream who relied on the steady flow of the River Kent to maintain their operations. The loss of bogs which had released water into the river, maintaining its steady flow, meant that the flow fluctuated widely, interrupting operation of the mills. The building of a reservoir to regulate the flow was a small part of a much bigger scheme to build a series of reservoirs in the parish of Kendal to regulate the River Sprint, otherwise known as the Sleddale Beck, the River Mint, known at the time as the Bannesdale Beck, and the River Kent. By 1844 there were 15 mills on the Kent, three on the Sprint and five on the Mint, processing wool, gunpowder, bobbins, logwood, dyewood, paper, marble and iron. Water power was important because there were no sources of coal nearby. A total of ten mill owners and the mayor of Kendal formed a provisional committee, which resolved to build reservoirs in Kentmere and elsewhere, to maintain flows on the rivers. The mayor was involved because Kendal Corporation owned the water rights and leasehold to Castle Mill. The committee lost no time in employing the eminent water engineer John Frederick Bateman to advise on the scheme, who in turn commissioned Job Bintley to survey the proposed sites in September and October 1844. By November there was serious discussion in the local press, both for and against the scheme. Arguments against the scheme focused on the high cost, the fact that it would only be a benefit to a small number of mill owners, it would use up valuable agricultural land, and would cause desolation and loss of life if the dam burst. Those supporting the scheme argued that Kendal was losing out as a manufacturing town to those which had a cheap supply of coal, and enabling the mills to operate regularly would boost the manufacturing industry, and hence the prosperity of the town. The provisional committee consisted of James Gandy of Dockray Hall woollen and dye-wood mill, Kendal; J. Wakefield of old Sedgwick and Bassing Ghyll gunpowder mills; John Ireland of Low Mills woollen mill and iron foundry; J. H. Wilson; John Whitwell also of Dockray Hall mill; Cornelius Nicholson of Cowan Head and Burneside paper mills; J. Philipson of Ullthwaite corn mill, Kentmere; B. Turton of Staveley bobbin mill; George Suart of Scroggs bobbin mill, near Staveley; and J. J. Wilson who bought Castle Mill from Kendal Corporation in 1853. They considered Bateman's report, and introduced a private bill into parliament in 1845 to get permission for the scheme. =Authorised works= The bill became an Act of Parliament when Queen Victoria signed it on 21 July 1845. It authorised the building of Kentmere Head reservoir, with a capacity of impounded by an earth dam which was high. It collected water from an area of , which was relatively small, but the rainfall was high. It was situated in a region where there was a good supply of rock and boulder clay for the construction. The second reservoir was to be Skeggles Water, where a high dam would impound . It would gather water from an area of , and would have had the largest surface area of the reservoirs, at , as opposed to just for Kentmere Head. Three separate dams would have been built, and this reservoir was favoured by Bateman, because he thought it would cost the least, and would provide a similar yield to Kentmere Head. However, his estimates were wildly inaccurate, as was his prediction of the available rainfall. On Bannisdale, Bateman proposed a lower and an upper reservoir, as to create a single reservoir would have required a dam with a height of , which was too ambitious for the time. The lower reservoir required a dam with a height of to impound , with the dam located below Dryhowe Bridge. The upper dam was to be located half way up the valley, would have been slightly lower at , but would have had more capacity, holding of water. The fifth reservoir authorised was in Longsleddale, with a high dam located just above Sadgill farm. With a capacity of , it would have flooded most of the upper valley, with a water level at around above ordnance datum. The Act named 12 Commissioners, several of whom had been on the original committee. All had to be occupiers of mills on the rivers affected, with an annual value exceeding £50. The major of Kendal was a Commissioner while the Corporation owned water rights. The others were John Wakefield of Sedgwick gunpowder mills; John Gandy, James Gandy, John Edward Whitwell and Isaac Whitwell of Dockray Hall Mills; John Jowitt Wilson, William Wilson, and John Hewetson Wilson of Castle Mills; John Ireland of Low Mills; Cornelius Nicholson of Cowan Head and Burneside paper mills; and Benjamin Turton of Staveley Bobbin Mill. The Commissioners could build any or all of the five reservoirs. As well as having powers to borrow money to fund construction, they could collect rates from individual mills, which were based on the number of feet of fall in level at that mill. Any corn mill with less than 6 pairs of stones did not have to pay rates, while the Barley Bridge corn mill at Staveley was exempt. The Act also stated that the Commissioners were the only ones authorised to build reservoirs in the named valleys. This fact was overlooked by Manchester Corporation in 1962 when they considered building a reservoir for drinking water supply in Bannisdale. =Works built= Despite Bateman's preference for the Skeggles Water reservoir, the Commissioners decided to build Kentmere Head reservoir first. On 9 October 1845, they awarded a tender for construction of the dam to Messrs Shuttleworth and Dobson. The contract price was £6,150, and they also paid £960 for of land. A cottage for the reservoir keeper was to cost £45. These costs exceeded Bateman's estimate by 60 percent, and Job Bintley's estimate when he had originally proposed the reservoir in 1844 by 350 percent. The total cost was £13,435 by the time the work was completed in the summer of 1848. Shortly afterwards, the bywash channel was damaged in a flood, and had to be repaired and extended at a cost of £686. Although Bateman does not appear to have been involved during the actual construction, his specification for building the dam has been preserved by James Cropper of Burneside Paper Mill. It specifies that the clay core was to be built up in layers, each thick, and that complete layers should be finished before work started on the next layer. The clay was to be soaked for 12 hours, and then cut into blocks, which were to be worked into the layer below by treading it. The earth dam was to be made of concave layers, thick on the upstream side, and twice that thickness on the downstream side. Material for the upstream side was to be adhesive, and watered in to become nearly waterproof, while the downstream bank was to be built of dry or stony material. The dam had a slope of 1 in 3 on the upstream face and 1 in 2 on the downstream face. A central clay core was thick at the crest of the dam and thick at the bottom of the dam. The upstream face was covered in stone cladding, while the outlet pipe ran through the bottom of the dam with a valve house on the downstream side. Of the five reservoirs authorised, only Kentmere Head was built. By the time it was completed, the railways had reached Kendal, and coal from the Wigan coalfields was readily available. Steam engines began to replace water power, with Castle Mill installing a engine in 1850. Wakefields, who operated the Sedgwick lower gunpowder mill on the east bank of the river moved their operations to Gatebeck on the Peasey Beck, which was supplied with compensation water from the Killington Reservoir, built to supply the Lancaster Canal. There was no enthusiasm to pay rates from the smaller mills, with even less to spend large amounts of money on new works, and so the Commissioners of the Kendal Reservoirs became the Commissioners of the Kentmere Reservoir. =Operation= There was a steady decline in the number of mills using water power. James Cropper & Company became the largest user when they opened a paper mill at Bowston in 1880, as they then owned a total fall of . With the other large mills closing or turning to steam power, they became the only contributor to the Commissioners, and effectively owned the reservoir. They have funded the maintenance costs since then. The Reservoir (Safety Provisions) Act 1930 required reservoirs to be inspected, and the Commissioners asked E. C. Oakes, the water engineer from Preston Corporation to carry out their assessment in 1933. He reported that there was some subsidence, there were leaks in the clay core and at least one of the outlet pipes through the dam was broken. Repairs were carried out, with all of the outlet pipes being renewed, and as the valve in the valve house was no longer operational, a new valve was installed on the upstream side of the dam, with control rods running up the stone cladding of the dam to a control wheel on its crest. One unexpected consequence of moving the control valve to the upstream side of the dam was that the rectangular culvert which carried water between the reservoir and the original cut-off valve well, near the core of the dam, was now pressurised in a way for which it had not been designed, and the entrance to the culvert collapsed in 1964. A repair was made by welding oil drums together to form a circular tube, and then grouting the gap around the outside of the tube with concrete, to form a circular concrete pipe. As the steel drums corroded away, it became clear that not all the voids had been filled, and further grouting was carried out in 1977. In the 120 years since its construction, the clay core had consolidated, lowering its top to a point where water could soak through the fill above it, which might cause slippage of the downstream face of the dam. Rather than restoring the core to its former level, a new spillway was cut into the existing spillway. It was long, and lowered the maximum water level by . This reduced the storage capacity from to . By 1970 there were just five mills operational on the Kent. The Water Resources Act 1963 established 27 River Authorities to replace the 32 River Boards existing at that time. The Kent was within the jurisdiction of the Lancashire River Authority, and section 58 of the Act gave them powers to charge mills for each thousand gallons abstracted from a river for the generation of power, even though the water was returned to the river a little further downstream. This effectively killed the use of water power, and Croppers, who used water to drive turbines which generated electricity to power their mill at Burneside, could no longer afford the cost, and the turbines were shut down in 1972. As the effective owner of the reservoir, Croppers have made various attempts to dispose of the reservoir. An approach was made to the Lakes and Lune Water Board in 1972 or 1973, to see whether they could use the facility for water supply, but they were not prepared to do so. In 1995, having failed to interest either North West Water or the National Rivers Authority (NRA) in taking it over, they offered to give the reservoir to any new owner for free in return for their paying for repairs totalling £100,000 plus annual maintenance of over £2,000. No buyers came forward and Croppers remain the de facto owners of the reservoir. In 1995, the Supervising Engineer for the reservoir expressed concern at the volume of water emerging at the outlet, which was thought to be caused by leakage, as it could not be reduced by operating the outlet valve. Croppers agreed to bring the next statutory inspection forward by two years, and assembled documention on the reservoir, which revealed a succession of problems starting soon after its construction. Major issues included raising of the embankment due to settlement in 1852, 1861 and 1926, rebuilding of the bywash in 1864 after it failed, and lowering of the overflow weir by in 1926. The statutory inspection took place in May 1995, which involved CCTV inspection of the culvert after the reservoir had been drained. There were significant problems with the culvert through the upstream bank, and the inspector would not sanction refilling the reservoir. Possible options were breaching the embankment, reducing the volume of water stored to below so that the reservoir was no longer subject to the provisions of the Reservoir Safety Act, or carrying out immediate repairs. Because the reservoir is located in the Lake District National Park, there was public outcry at the thought of breaching the dam, with its effect on an area of natural beauty, while reducing the capacity of the reservoir would have been almost as contentious, and so was discounted. Although Croppers did not use the water from the reservoir, they decided to carry out repairs, which consisted of grouting of the foundations and crest of the dam; insertion of a liner into the scour pipe and a CCTV survey to prove its effectiveness; building a wall along the crest of the dam to prevent wave action damaging the downstream slope; removing silt from the tunnel through the downstream embankment; and grouting the spillway. A contract worth £100,125 was awarded to Askan Construction of Lancaster, with work commencing in August 1996. The liner consisted of a diameter HDPE pipe manufactured by Stewarts and Lloyds Plastic, and butt welded on site. Once all issues had been remedied, the reservoir was filled slowly, using the outlet valve to prevent water levels rising too fast. As a result of the work, the reservoir then met modern standards, and was expected to remain in good condition for several decades. The work carried out to the dam was gratefully acknowledged by Kentmere Parish meeting in a letter sent to James Cropper. Physical features and location The reservoir is built in an area where the underlying rocks are low-grade metamorphic, similar to slate, or volcanic. These are covered by a wide layer of slates and grits of Silurian age, which are more or less impermeable. The reservoir dam wall is long at its crest with a stepped weir type overflow at the western end, and there is a lower outlet for the River Kent in the middle of the dam wall. The reservoir's location is quiet and secluded, surrounded by the fells of Yoke, Froswick, Ill Bell, Thornthwaite Crag, Harter Fell, Mardale Ill Bell and Kentmere Pike. These fells, which make up the Kentmere horseshoe walk around the head and flanks of the Kentmere valley, throw down steep slopes to the shore and give fine views of the reservoir.

Early life and career Khalaf was born into a wealthy Palestinian Christian family from Ramallah. His father, Hanna Khalaf, was a businessman who immigrated to the United States in 1921 and worked there for several years before ultimately returning to Ramallah. Khalaf attended Cairo University in Egypt, where he received a degree from the School of Law. In 1972, he was elected Mayor of Ramallah, having previously served as the city's District Attorney. Khalaf adopted largely moderate stances concerning Israel; he supported a policy of non-cooperation with the military occupation of the West Bank, but was among the first Palestinian public officials to advocate a two-state peace solution. In his early years as mayor, Khalaf was reluctant to deal with Yasser Arafat and the Palestine Liberation Organization. However, when he faced re-election in 1976, a split had begun to form between \\"pro-PLO\\" and \\"anti-PLO\\" politicians in the Palestinian municipalities. At this time, Khalaf began coordinating contacts with the PLO and promoting the group as the Palestinians' best vehicle for peace negotiations. This change in attitude allowed Khalaf to win a second term; in a year when many officials in the West Bank were voted out of office for not adequately backing Arafat and his aims. He won a third term in 1980. Khalaf married the former Teresa Santo Campers, originally from Italy, in 1965. They had two daughters together. Assassination attempt In early 1980, a group of Israeli yeshiva students were killed in Hebron by Palestinian militants. The Jewish Underground, an Israeli militant group, compiled a report suggesting that Khalaf and a handful of other prominent Palestinian officials had ordered the killings. In May, the group planted car bombs in vehicles belonging to several prominent Palestinian officials, including Khalaf's Cadillac sedan. The bombs seriously injured Bassam Shaka'a, the then-mayor of Nablus, and Khalaf. Both were hospitalized in critical condition, and the incident resulted in Shaka'a losing both of his legs. Khalaf lost his right foot in the attack, and used a prosthesis and walking cane for the remainder of his life. Israel's internal security service, Shin Bet, began an investigation into the bombings, but the Jewish Underground was not discovered as the culprit for several years. Members involved were sentenced to prison terms of varying lengths. No verifiable evidence was ever found linking Khalaf to the Hebron attack, and it is generally accepted that he was not involved.\\"Two Teeth for a Tooth!\\" Monday, Jun. 16, 1980 Time MagazineDonald Neff: Jewish Terrorists Try to Assassinate Three Palestinian Mayors Washington Report on Middle East Affairs, June 1999, pages 87–88 Removal from office and death In March 1982, the Israeli government removed Khalaf from his mayoral post for refusing to co-operate with their administration of the West Bank. They forbade him from leaving the area and replaced him with an Israeli military administrator. He died of a heart attack in 1985. References Sources * \\"The Road to Emmaus\\", by James M.

It is endemic to the northeastern submontane forests of Bahia, Sergipe, Pernambuco, Paraíba, Ceará and Piauí states of Brazil. Although this species exists in many places, where it occurs it is either not numerous, or its numbers are declining due to loss of habitat.  Ecology  Manilkara rufula, along with its speciatic cousins M. longifolia and M. maxima, provide nectar as food for a primate called the golden-headed lion tamarin (Leontopithecus chrysomelas). Both tree and tamarin are only found in those remnants of Atlantic forest remaining in the northeastern region of Brazil. This habitat has long been disappearing through decades of intensive logging, followed by further disturbance in the converting of logged land to subsistence farming. What is left of said habitat comprises less than four percent of its original area. These small habitats, islands of forest called \\"brejos\\", are fragments of moist forest caatingas, surrounded on every side by either dry forest caatingas, or by cerrados, swaths of shrubby vegetation resembling savanna, where M. rufula cannot grow. Unlike its dryer neighbors, caatinga moist forests occur primarily along inaccessible ridges and on solitary prominences, and are deluged by tropical rains measuring from 1,000 to 1,300 mm annually. Manilkara rufula, along with some of its tree species associates (Podocarpus sellowii, Prunus sphaerocarpa, for example) is a remnant of an earlier climatological regime, when the northeast region as a whole was far moister than most of it is today.

The average length of this species is 75mm (3 in) for males and 95mm (3.7 in) for females. The insect is found in deciduous forest throughout North America, where it eats many types of plant foliage. Even though the common walkingstick is a generalist it does tend to prefer foliage from oak and hazelnut trees. Localised clusters of these insects sometimes occur; however, the insects have no wings, and dispersal from tree to tree is limited. Description A pair of mating D. femorata in the Hudson Highlands region of New York The common walkingstick is a slender, elongated insect that camouflages itself by resembling a twig. The sexes differ, with the male usually being brown and about in length while the female is greenish-brown, and rather larger at . There are three pairs of legs, but at rest, the front pair is extended forward beside the antennae, forming an extension of the twig-like effect. Neither sex has wings, the antennae are two thirds of the length of the body, and each of the cerci (paired appendages at the tip of the abdomen) has a single segment. Distribution This walkingstick is native to North America. Its range extends from the Atlantic coast from Maine to Florida, as far west as California and northwards to North Dakota. It also occurs in Canada (where it is the only stick insect) being present in Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec. Ecology D. femorata is herbivorous, feeding mainly on the leaves of trees. They are leaf skeletonisers, eating the tissues between the leaf veins, pausing for a while and then walking on to new leaves. They can feed at any time of day but the greatest feeding activity has been noted between nine PM and three AM. Early-stage nymphs are often found on American hazel (Corylus americana) and black cherry (Prunus serotina), but where these are scarce, they are likely to be on white oak (Quercus alba). Older individuals may choose black oak (Quercus velutina). Another food tree is the black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia). Adults are present in August and September in the northern part of the range, but because of their tendency to feed high in the canopy, the insects are seldom seen. The stick insect life cycle is hemimetabolous, proceeding through a series of nymphal stages. Breeding takes place in late summer after the nymph has moulted for the last time and become an adult. Egg-laying takes place about a week after mating and the eggs, measuring across, are dropped singly to the forest floor. Here they overwinter in the leaf litter, hatching the following May or even a year later. If conditions are dry, the newly hatched young may fail to extricate themselves from their egg-capsules. Ones that succeed in doing so climb up the trunks of trees, start to feed on the foliage, and pass through four to six moults as they grow.

The parish of Cuddington was part of Epsom Rural District and became part of the borough of Epsom and Ewell in 1933, with portions to the northeast and south becoming part of Cheam. History Cuddington lay within the Copthorne hundred, a strategic and judicial division predominantly used in Anglo Saxon England to supplement the county and parish (see vestry). In the Middle Ages the estates of Cuddington extended over , the southern part being upon the chalk downs, the centre on the Woolwich and Thanet beds, the rest upon the London clay. There was no ecclesiastical parish; the land was taxed with Ewell, but separately rated, with its own overseers. It appears in Domesday Book of 1086 as Codintone. Its domesday assets were: 5 hides; 1 mill worth 3 shillings; and 9 ploughs. It rendered £9 12s. Its total population was recorded as 28 households.Cuddington Domesday Open Domesday Henry VIII purchased the manor in 1538 from Richard Codington, who was the heir to his father's estate, and Elizabeth, Richard's wife (as was typical added as a trustee to override any interests she otherwise could have claimed for their offspring). The whole of the former village of Cuddington, with its mansion and church, were swept away by Henry VIII to make room for the palace afterwards known as Nonsuch, and its two parks -- the Great Park or Worcester Park containing , and the Little Park containing , part of which remains and part of which has been converted to residential areas of Ewell and Cheam. The palace was never fully completed by Henry VIII but was sufficient under Mary I of England to be used by Keeper of the Banqueting House, Sir Thomas Cawarden to entertain Gilles de Noailles, the French Ambassador. The Tudor period historian and classical civilisation connoisseur John Leland praised the palace's design in Latin verse. After the destruction of Nonsuch in 1671–2 the parkland was taken over by neighbouring farms. Within the current Nonsuch Park, where the palace once stood, is a small rise of land enclosing the foundation remains of the demolished chapel, parts of the masonry of which were used in the palace's construction. The church of St Philip, Cheam Common, was built in 1876, and an ecclesiastical parish was formed for it in 1906 officially from \\"Cheam and Cuddington parish\\" however the latter term was long out of use and dropped by the Church of England.Cheam St Dunstan Church of England.

It was incorporated and started operations in 1864, running from the Capitol to the War Department and along H Street NW in downtown. It added lines on 9th Street NW, on 4th Street SW/SE, along Connecticut Avenue to Dupont Circle, to Georgetown, to Mt. Pleasant and north along Georgia Avenue. In the late 19th Century it was purchased by the Washington Traction and Electric Company and on February 4, 1902, became a part of the Washington Railway and Electric Company. Origins Map of the Washington, D.C. Streetcar System at the end of the Horse Car era in 1888 The Metropolitan Railroad Company, was incorporated on July 1, 1864, two years after the Washington and Georgetown Railroad Company. It opened two lines. One from the Capitol to the War Department at 14th and I Streets NW and a second along H Street NW from Massachusetts Avenue NW to 17th Street NW. When it started, it used two-horse cars, but in 1865 it switched to smaller cars pulled by one horse. Expansion In 1872, it began operations on a 9th Street line with a terminus on M Street NW. In that same year it bought the Union Railroad Company. The Union, chartered on January 19, 1872, was to lay track from the Treasury Building at 15th Street and New York Avenue NW to Georgetown across the P Street Bridge and then on various streets in Georgetown. The Metropolitan used the Union's charter to build a line into Georgetown. The Boundary and Silver Spring Railway Company was purchased by the Metropolitan in 1873. The Boundary and Silver Spring, also chartered on January 19, 1872, was to run a streetcar from Boundary Street NW to the Maryland-D.C. boundary along the Washington City and Rockville Turnpike (now Georgia Avenue NW). Again, the Metropolitan only purchased a charter and used it to run streetcars along Georgia Avenue all the way to Rock Creek Church Road NW. In 1874, the Metropolitan acquired the Connecticut Avenue and Park Railway. The Connecticut Avenue and Park was chartered on July 13, 1868. This line started at the terminus of the Metropolitan at 17th and H Streets NW and ran north up Connecticut Avenue NW to Boundary Street NW. The streetcar line did not continue up Connecticut Avenue NW from this point because the grade was too steep for the horse-drawn cars. Operation of this line began in April 1873. Though tracks were laid on Connecticut Avenue NW north of P Street NW, cars did not run on this portion until 1883 when local residents petitioned Metropolitan to begin a shuttle service. By 1888 the Metropolitan had built additional lines down 4th Street NW/SW to the Arsenal at P Street SW and on East Capitol Street to 9th Street. Switch to electricity The old Boundary and Silver Spring line on Seventh Street Extended NW - a.k.a. Brightwood Avenue NW (now known as Georgia Avenue NW) - was never profitable. On October 18, 1888, the day after electric streetcar operations began in Washington, Congress authorized the Brightwood Railway Company to purchase and electrify the Metropolitan's streetcar line and to extend it to the District boundary at Silver Spring. In 1890 the Metropolitan sold the line to the upstart company. In 1890, while the city's streetcars switched to electric and mechanical power, the Metropolitan experimented with batteries but found them unsatisfactory. On August 2, 1894, Congress ordered the Metropolitan to switch to underground electrical power. It complied, installing the underground sliding shoe on the north–south line in January 1895. It was the first successful installation of such a system in the Western Hemisphere (having previously been installed in Budapest, Hungary). Though mostly a success, the underground power conduits had drawbacks. In the winter, the plow would get jammed by snow and ice and in the summer the conduits swelled shut. The Metropolitan switched the rest of the system to electric power on July 7, 1896. The new system required new construction in and in 1895, Metropolitan built a massive, Romanesque style car barn on the corner of 4th Street SW and P Street SW. In the same year, Metropolitan built a loop on 35th Street NW and 36th Street NW to Prospect Street NW to connect it to the Georgetown Car Barn. In 1896 it extended service along East Capitol Street to 15th Street and built the East Capitol Street Car Barn, a Romanesque Revival style building designed by Waddy Wood, to serve as a barn, repair shop, and administrative offices ( photo); In the same year the company extended its service along Columbia Road NW and Mount Pleasant Street NW as far as Park Road NW. Metropolitan Coach Company After the Herdic Phaeton Company went under in 1896, the Metropolitan Railroad started a coach company running horse drawn coaches. It began carrying passengers from 16th and T Streets NW to 22nd and G Streets NW, but the route changed, later running from 16th and U Streets NW to the Treasury Building and then along Pennsylvania Avenue NW to 9th Street NW. It began operations on May 1, 1897, with a car barn at 1914 E Street NW. In 1904 it became its own corporation. The end of the line Georgetown, features streetcar tracks installed by the Metropolitan Railroad in the 1890s. Between the years 1896 and 1899, three businessmen purchased controlling interests in several streetcar companies including the Metropolitan Railroad Company. They incorporated the Washington Traction and Electric Company on June 5, 1899, as a holding company for these interests. But the holding company had borrowed too heavily and paid too much for the subsidiaries and was quickly in financial trouble. Because of this, Congress - on June 5, 1900 - authorized the Washington and Great Falls to acquire the stock of any and all of the railways and power companies owned by Washington Traction. When Washington Traction defaulted on its loans on June 1, 1901, Washington and Great Falls moved in to take its place. On February 4, 1902, Washington and Great Falls changed its name to the Washington Railway and Electric Company, reincorporated as a holding company and exchanged stock in Washington Traction and Electric one for one for stock in the new company (at a discounted rate).

Mascagnia in the traditional sense of was a highly polyphyletic assemblage, a form-genus based on the lateral- winged samaras. Since the mid-1980s, morphological and molecular studies led to the removal of discordant elements, which were assigned to the genera Adelphia, Aenigmatanthera, Alicia, Amorimia, Calcicola, Callaeum, Carolus, Christianella, Malpighiodes, Niedenzuella, and Psychopterys. In addition, phylogenetic analyses showed that Triopterys is nested within Mascagnia. The species formerly assigned to Triopterys were transferred to Mascagnia, which is now a monophyletic genus. The correct name for the species often called Mascagnia macroptera in the horticulture trade is Callaeum macropterum; the names are not interchangeable.

His branch of the Campbell baronets is referred to as St Cross Mede. Biography Guy entered the army as an ensign in the 6th Regiment of Foot in 1795, of which his father was then lieutenant-colonel, and was promoted lieutenant on 4 April 1796. He served in all the regiment's engagements under his father's command during the Irish Rebellion of 1798. Campbell, with the rest of the regiment, went to Canada in 1803, and he was promoted captain on 14 September 1804. (By this time, his father had been promoted to major-general and held a command in Ireland.) Guy again saw action with the 6th during the Peninsular War, fighting at Roliça and Vimeiro, and taking part in the advance and retreat of Sir John Moore. Promoted major on 1 April 1813, Campbell and the 6th fought at Vitoria (21 June 1813), and owing to the wounding of the colonel, took command of the regiment. During the subsequent campaigns, Campbell led the 6th during the Battle of the Pyrenees, and was badly wounded while leading the regiment, on 2 August 1813, to the storming of the Heights of Echalar, a feat which won the commendation of Wellington for the regiment. Campbell was breveted lieutenant-colonel on 26 August 1813 as a result. After the war, he received a gold medal for his conduct at the Battle of the Pyrenees and was awarded the CB. He was created a baronet on 22 May 1815 in recognition of the services of his father, the remainder being to his father's heirs-male. He rejoined the 6th in 1815, and served as a staff officer at the Battle of Waterloo, going on half-pay in 1816. Sir Guy married Frances Elizabeth Burgoyne on 17 January 1817, by whom he had one daughter before her death on 8 May 1818. He remarried on 21 November 1820 to Pamela FitzGerald (1795/1796 - 25 November 1869), the eldest daughter of Lord Edward FitzGerald and Pamela Syms. By her he had four sons, of whom one died in infancy, and six daughters. Campbell was appointed deputy quartermaster-general in Ireland in 1830, and was promoted major- general in 1841, receiving command of the Athlone district. On 24 October 1848, he was appointed colonel of the 3rd West India Regiment. He died in 1849 at Dún Laoghaire after a long illness and is buried at Collins Barracks, then known as the Royal Barracks, in Dublin. Sir Guy's descendant, Sir Guy Campbell, 5th Baronet was baronet from 1960 until his death in 1993, and the current baronet is his son, Lachlan Campbell.

This list is generated by analysis of a blueprint or other design document. The list of required materials for construction is sometimes referred to as the material take off list (MTOL). Material take off is not limited to the amount of required material, but also the weight of the items taken off. This is important when dealing with larger structures, allowing the company that does the take off to determine total weight of the item and how best to move the item (if necessary) when construction is completed. Definition used by the ISA (International Society of Automation) A material take off (MTO) is the process of analyzing the drawings and determining all the materials required to accomplish the design. Thereafter, the material take off is used to create a bill of materials (BOM). Inspection does not aid in creating a bill of materials. Procurement and requisition are activities that occur after the bill of materials is complete. References *Whitt, Successful Instrument and Control System Design, ISA Press, 2004.

He spent the bulk of his career with Gillingham, where he set a record for the highest number of goals scored in a single season which still stands. Playing career Born in Royston, Morgan worked as a miner from the age of 14 and played for his colliery football team, leading them to a Sheffield Senior Cup win shortly after World War II, the first time a works team had won the cup. Morgan initially turned down the chance to turn professional, despite being offered a contract by Barnsley, but eventually signed for Lincoln City, albeit on a part-time basis. He only managed three Football League appearances for the \\"Red Imps\\" and was allowed to move on to Gillingham in 1953 for a fee of £3,000. Finally turning fully professional with the Kent club, he scored 21 goals in his debut season and then topped this by scoring 31 in 1954–55, a new club record. This record was equalled by Brian Yeo during the 1970s but Morgan remains the joint holder of the record to this day. He was selected to play for the Third Division South team against the North in 1955–56. Morgan's playing career came to an end due to injury in 1957. Managerial career In 1962 Morgan was appointed manager of Chatham Town, having previously served as coach. He went on to manage a number of other Kent non-league clubs, with his greatest success coming at Dartford, whom he led to the Southern League championship and an appearance in the FA Trophy final at Wembley Stadium.

It is one of the most recognizable of Simberg's works, and was voted Finland's \\"national painting\\" in a vote held by the Ateneum art museum in 2006. In a similar 2013 vote held by Nordic Moneta, it was voted second most important. Like other Simberg works, the atmosphere is melancholic: the angelic central figure with her bandaged forehead and bloodied wing, the sombre clothing of her two youthful bearers. The direct gaze of the right-hand figure touches the viewer. The procession passes through a recognisable landscape, that of Eläintarha, Helsinki, with Töölönlahti Bay in the background. Leppänen, Marko: Maalaukseen astuminen – Haavoittunut enkeli Eläintarhassa Esoteerinen maantiede ja periferiaterapia. Accessed 16 April 2010. The same road still skirts Töölönlahti Bay today. In Hugo Simberg’s time, the park was a popular spot for leisure-time activities among the working classes. At the time, many charity institutions were located in Eläintarha park; in The Wounded Angel the healthy boys are carrying the injured girl towards the Blind Girls’ School and the Home for Cripples. She clutches a bunch of snowdrops, symbolic of healing and rebirth. Simberg himself declined to offer any deconstruction, suggesting that the viewer draw their own conclusions. However it is known that Simberg had been suffering from meningitis, and that the painting was a source of strength during his recovery. The Wounded Angel at the Ateneum website This can also be read metaphorically: meningitis is known to cause neck stiffness, lethargy and light sensitivity, each of which is exhibited by the central figure. If read as lungs rather than wings, such a diagnosis even explains the minor injury, as tubercular meningitis causes abrasions to the upper lungs. The Wounded Angel was praised by a number of Finnish artists when first displayed in 1903 at the Ateneum autumn exhibition. In a letter to his sister Blenda, Simberg wrote on the 10th of October 1903: ”I wanted to share the good news with you – I was not rejected this year, even though the jury was terribly strict. It seems that I have achieved something of a grand succés among my colleagues and the members of the jury. Gallén is so excited that I can hardly take him seriously. His first words were the highest flattery of my work and, oddly, he seems quite beside himself with enthusiasm for the big painting. He says that it gives him the impression that I had stood alone in a little cabin, huddled in the midst of a great forest, and had painted in complete indifference to the outside world. He says that it radiates peace and harmony like no other work in the exhibition – Even Edelfelt said nice things to me.” Olavinen 2000, page 96. Hugo Simberg 1873–1917. Text by Anja Olavinen. Helsinki: Ateneum (Ateneum Publications No. 13), When Simberg was asked to paint frescoes for the Tampere Cathedral in 1905–06, one was a larger version of The Wounded Angel, his favorite painting.

Combat chronicle The 15th Reserve Division fought on the Western Front, participating in the opening German offensive which led to the Allied Great Retreat, fighting at Sedan in late August 1914. It fought in the First Battle of the Marne. Thereafter, it remained in the line in the Champagne region and fought in the Second Battle of Champagne in September–October 1915. It fought on the Aisne until September 1916, and then joined the Battle of the Somme. Its next major engagement was the Battle of Arras in the Spring of 1917. In May 1917, the division was transferred to the Eastern Front, where it resisted the Russian Summer Offensive known as the Kerensky Offensive. It remained on the Eastern Front until the armistice on that front, and then returned to the Western Front, arriving in the Verdun region at the beginning of January 1918. It went to the Flanders/Artois region in April 1918 and remained in that general area until the end of the war.

The neighborhood was constructed during the 18th century for the residents of the Ribera neighborhood who had been displaced by the construction of the Ciutadella of Barcelona. The neighborhood is roughly triangular, bordered by the Mediterranean Sea, the Moll d'Espanya of Port Vell, and the El Born neighborhood. This neighborhood has its own flag, and is serviced by its own stop on the Barcelona Metro line 4. This is a good starting point for whatever itinerary there may be to adventure through La Barceloneta. The yellow line, L4, which is the metro line that stops at La Barceloneta, is the most popular for pickpocketing. The neighborhood can also be discovered by taking Las Gorondrinas, which leave from the front port of the Columbus monument. This way the marine strip can be discovered, but the real charm of this neighborhood is by getting lost in the side streets or alleyways. Torre Sant Sebastià is the terminus of the Port Vell Aerial Tramway; opened in 1931, it connects La Barceloneta with Montjuïc across Port Vell. La Barceloneta is known for its sandy beach (which made an appearance in Don Quixote, book 2) and its many restaurants and nightclubs along the boardwalk. Over the past several years the quality of the sand on the beach has become a source of continued controversy. In February 2008, the World Health Organization began an inquiry designed to ascertain whether the sand meets WHO beach health and safety guidelines. With its modernity, La Barceloneta continues to inhabit the scent of salt and marine life. For many, this is considered a luxury. La Barceloneta also attracts many cruise ships to dock. Among the attractions on Barceloneta's beach are German artist Rebecca Horn's \\"Homenatge a la Barceloneta\\" monument, and, where the beach gives way to the Port Olímpic, Frank Gehry's modern \\"Peix d'Or\\" sculpture. In the center of the neighborhood, there is a small museum, called \\"Casa de la Barceloneta\\", which is housed in a preserved building dating back to 1761. Admission to the museum serves as an insight into the evolution of the neighborhood and its history. The house has a stone façade with letters and number engraved that are inscriptions of the plots used in construction.  History  La Barceloneta was practically an uninhabited zone until the mid 18th century. Fishermen were the first to frequent this part of Barcelona even though the sea conditions were very precarious. In 1754, construction of the first houses began, and the neighborhood began to become filled with residents who took part in activities of the port. The neighborhood of La Barceloneta was designed by an engineer named Juan Martín Cermeño. The famous markets located in La Barceloneta were designed by the Catalan architect Antoni Rovira i Trias in 1873. He had an urban plan for the future of Barcelona architecture which won the 1859 municipal contest by city council's decree, but the central government in Madrid favored the plan of Ildefons Cerdà. Rovira and his work were soon forgotten and lost in history, until a book was published about his style of urban planning and the other works he was responsible for, like the numerous markets in La Barceloneta. In the present day, in the building of Palau de Mar on the Passeig de Joan de Borbó, exists the History Museum of Catalonia. This museum contains a permanent exhibit about the history of Catalonia up until its industrialization, the era of dictatorship, or the present day democracy. Additionally, the terrace of their cafeteria has an excellent view of the neighborhood and the port. This neighborhood is far from lacking ancient history with its churches, like the Sant Miquel del Port located in the Barceloneta plaza. This church is located near the beach campus of Pompeu Fabra University. In close distance to the History Museum of Catalonia resides the Clock Tower. This is an example of some of the ancient constructions in the neighborhood. It was constructed in 1772 within the Fishermen's Wharf and worked as the lighthouse port up until the mid 19th century. When the port was modernized, the use for the lighthouse became obsolete. To maintain its base, the tower was transformed into a clock in the mid 19th century. This clock tower was one of the materials used by scientist Pierre Méchain as he measured the length of the meridian arc between Barcelona and Dunkirk in 1791, which led to the creation of the decimal metric system. La Llotja, another building found in La Barceloneta neighborhood, is a neoclassical building with a Gothic interior built in the 14th century. Inside the two story building are examples of medieval works and neoclassical sculptures. In 1775, la Llotja became involved with the Real Academia, a school associated with the industrial arts and other visual arts. At that time, the school was named la Escuela Gratuita de Diseño and was located on the highest floor of la Llotja. It was not until 1928 that it renamed itself the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Jorge, and in 1989 converted its name into Catalan: Reial Acadèmia Catalana de Belles Arts de Sant Jordi (English: Royal Catalan Academy of Fine Arts of Saint George). The Carmen Amaya Fountain is another historical landmark placed within La Barceloneta in 1959. It is located where Carrer Sant Carles joins the beach. It was constructed as tribute for the famous flamenco dancer Carmen Amaya, who was born in a Gypsy settlement in La Barceloneta in 1913. The fountain itself portrays two guitarists and three flamenco dancers in the nude. It represents the uneasy past that La Barceloneta endured when it was populated by gypsies, fishermen, and full of shacks. In the 1970s, the shacks were dismantled, but the memories did not disappear. It was almost soon forgotten after the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona.  Present day  In the present day, the neighborhood of La Barceloneta continues to be perceived as foreign to the city of which it is located. However, the environment has changed dramatically, and with that, especially in the summer, for when the beach is most popular. From day to night, the beach of La Barceloneta is the most animated of all of Barcelona. La Barceloneta is home to a number of small bars or clubs, where one can eat dinner or order a drink until the wee hours of the early morning. Upon arrival to the beach, the environment and atmosphere of La Barceloneta changes. Today, the cosmopolitan neighborhood reaches its maximum entertainment factor in the summer. La Barceloneta is considered one of the best places to try fresh fish or paella in Barcelona. A selection of tapas are also offered off any menu. The most typical of the tapas of La Barceloneta would be called the \\"bomba.\\" It is a ball of potatoes filled with meat and the selection of spicy sauce or the classic aioli. A \\"caña,\\" a glass of beer from a barrel, is always served as well. Towards the beach, one might come across balconies with clothes hanging to dry, all types of shops, wineries, bars, and restaurants. La Barceloneta also homes a large Aquarium. This aquarium is said to be the biggest of Europe where one can discover the marine life of the Mediterranean Sea. The space composes of 20 large tanks and a transparent tunnel by which one can pass through sharks.

NTCIC is a tax credit syndicator. It operates by forming a legal partnership with a developer of historic real estate that results in NTCIC making an equity investment in the project in exchange for receiving rights to the federal tax credits generated by the rehabilitation of the property. NTCIC then furnishes the tax credits to a corporate entity that can use the tax credits to defray its federal income tax liability. The same can be done with state historic tax credits in states that have that legislation. Combining state and/or federal historic tax credits with the federal New Markets Tax Credit is also a possibility if the project is located in a low-income census tract. Syndicating historic tax credits can be a significant advantage for developers, especially those who do not have sufficient tax liability to claim the tax credits themselves. The \\"selling\\" of tax credits is also a useful means to acquire cash up front, that can be poured into the project once the partnership is formed, rather than waiting until federal or state taxes are filed and processed. This option is particularly attractive for nonprofit developers of real estate, such as nonprofit organizations, which do not pay taxes. Tax credit syndicators such as NTCIC can structure agreements that enable these nonprofit entities to still benefit from the federal credits. The result is that developers are able to \\"make the numbers work\\", enabling the rehabilitation of older and historic structures and ensuring that these pieces of America's cultural fabric will endure for future generations.

It is an intricately branched spiny shrub or small tree with its leaves arranged alternately or clustered on short shoots. The flowers have white or cream petals and the fruit are purple or red. It is threatened by habitat loss. Description Maytenus dhofarensis is a spiny shrub or small tree often forming more or less impenetrable thickets and growing throughout the escarpment woodlands and extending into the drier summit plateaux areas. Maytenus dhofarensis may be mistaken for M. senegalensis and the two species are not differentiated in local expertise. Taxonomy and naming Maytenus dhofarensis was first formally described in 1985 by Sebsebe Demissew and the description was published in Symbolae Botanicae Upsalienses. The specific epithet (dhofarensis) refers to Dhofar where this species is found. Distribution and habitat This species is endemic to Dhofar in Oman. These shrubs grow widely throughout Dhofar in drier areas as well as in monsoon areas. Uses and cultivation Cut branches were traditionally popular as building material for pens and enclosures, for perimeter fences around the settlement compounds, for building partitions or to make a dense barrier across a cave mouth, or the 'door' due to the vicious thorns that were considered to cause more pain and difficulty of extraction. Maytenus dhofarensis provides adequate firewood, however unpleasant thorns make it difficult to handle. If well known hardwood trees were absent, the wood of a well developed maytenus specimen would be used to make such vital weapons as a double-ended throwing stick and a knobbed club. Camels browse on the foliage but cattle are unenthusiastic. Goats eat the leaves and especially the flowers of M. dhofarensis, however the fruit is poisonous and can cause the goat to fall ill with shivering attacks and develop a raised temperature. Wider uses Many species of Maytenus are important in traditional medicine, and another species in the Celastraceae, Catha edulis, grown in the mountains of south-west Arabia and Ethiopia is the sources of Qat. In Yemen, the leaves of Maytenus species are used to make a tisane which is drunk to relieve pains in the stomach; the roots of Maytenus senegalensis are chipped into shavings and added to beer to be drunk as an aphrodisiac in parts of Africa. Researchers have also been able to isolate the active compound maytanisne from M. buchanii, which is on trial as a possible chemotherapeutic drug against cancer.

Standing Bear fought to preserve Lakota heritage and sovereignty and was at the forefront of a Progressive movement to change government policy toward Native Americans. Standing Bear was one of a small group of Lakota leaders of his generation who was born and raised in the oral traditions of their culture, educated in white culture, and wrote significant historical accounts of their people and history in English. Standing Bear's experiences in early life, the Carlisle Indian Industrial School, Wild Westing with Buffalo Bill, and life on government reservations present a unique view of a Native American during the Progressive Era in American history. Standing Bear's commentaries on Native American culture and wisdom educated the American public, deepened public awareness, and created popular support to change government policies toward Native American peoples. Luther Standing Bear helped create the popular twentieth-century image that Native American culture is holistic and respectful of nature; his classic commentaries appear in college-level reading lists in anthropology, literature, history, and philosophy, and constitute a legacy and treasury of Native American wisdom.Standing Bear \\"opened the reservation world and the Lakota point of view to the non-Indian.\\" Alida S.

Luther's father, George Standing Bear, was a Sicangu (Brulé Lakota) chief who raised him as a traditional hunter and warrior. In 1873, Luther Standing Bear saw the Sioux warriors return from the large-scale attack on a big hunting group of Pawnees in Massacre Canyon, Nebraska. Later he would write about it and be one of the very few to give a Sioux eyewitness account of the lead up to the attack on the hunters, and of his father's role in the battle.Standing Bear, Luther: My People, the Sioux. Lincoln, 1975, pp. 53–57. Standing Bear, Luther: Land of the Spotted Eagle. Lincoln and London, 1978, p. 41.

Donovin Arleigh Sprague, \\"Rosebud Sioux,\\" p. 40 (2005) In 1879, young Standing Bear began attending the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Luther's father was aware of white people's great numbers and influence, and he believed that education was the path Indians must follow in order to survive in the \\"white world\\".Joseph Agonito, \\"Lakota Portraits: Lives of the Legendary Plains People\\" (hereinafter \\"Agonito\\")(2011), p.237  Carlisle Industrial School for Indians  Luther Standing Bear with his father, George Standing Bear, at Carlisle Indian School, c. 1890 The Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, was one of the earliest Native American boarding schools, whose goal was cultural assimilation of Native Americans.Witmer, p.xvi. Carlisle had developed something of a rivalry with Harvard, and though the Indians had never beaten the Crimson, they always gave them a game. The Indians both admired and resented the Crimson, in equal amounts. They loved to sarcastically mimic the Harvard accent; even players who could barely speak English would drawl the broad Harvard a. But Harvard was also the Indians' idea of collegiate perfection, and they labeled any excellent performance, whether on the field or in the classroom, as \\"Harvard style.\\" Sally Jenkins, \\"The Real All Americans\\", (hereinafter \\"Jenkins\\")(2007), p.198. Standing Bear was one of the first students to arrive when Carlisle opened its doors in 1879.\\"My People the Sioux\\", p.133. Once there, he was asked to choose a name from a list on the wall. He randomly pointed at the symbols on a wall and named himself Luther. Standing Bear soon became Captain Richard Henry Pratt's model Carlisle student. Like many other Carlisle students, Standing Bear had high personal regard for Captain Pratt.My People the Sioux\\", p.xx. Standing Bear interpreted and recruited students for Pratt at Pine Ridge, South Dakota; led the Carlisle Indian Band across the Brooklyn Bridge upon its opening ceremony on May 24, 1883; and served as a student intern for John Wanamaker in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.My People the Sioux\\", p.vi.  Back on the reservation  In 1884, following his final term at Carlisle, Standing Bear, armed with a recommendation by Captain Pratt, returned home to the Rosebud Agency, Rosebud, Dakota Territory, where he was hired as an assistant at the reservation's school at the salary of three hundred dollars a year.\\"My People the Sioux\\", p.xxii. In 1890, some time after Wounded Knee, Standing Bear moved from Rosebud and followed his father and brother, Ellis Standing Bear, to Pine Ridge, South Dakota. Pine Ridge provided a series of varying employment and family ventures. In 1891, Standing Bear became principal of a reservation day school. Standing Bear also worked in his uncle's little general store. Standing Bear wrote to John Wanamaker to inquire about establishing a post office on the reservation, but was told that Native Americans were not legally permitted to serve as postmaster. The post office was set up in the name of a white missionary but run by Standing Bear.\\"My People the Sioux\\", p.234. Later, Standing Bear and his brother Ellis opened a dry goods store at Pass Creek and started a small ranch raising horses and cattle. Standing Bear organized public meetings at his dry goods store in Pine Ridge to discuss treaties and current events.\\"My People the Sioux\\", p. xvii. = Marriages and children = Standing Bear married Nellie DeCrory in 1886, and they had six children: Lily Standing Bear; Arthur Standing Bear; Paul Francis Standing Bear; Emily Standing Bear; Julia Standing Bear; and Alexandra Birmingham Cody Standing Bear.

However, the touring season was cut short on April 7, 1903, by a terrible accident in Maywood, Illinois, when the rear cars of Standing Bear's train were struck by another train. Three young Indians were killed, and 27 performers badly injured. Standing Bear was seriously injured and almost died. He suffered a dislocation of both hips, a left broken leg below the knee, a left broken arm, two broken ribs, a broken collar bone, a broken nose, and deep gashes on head.

From 1912 to the 1930s, he was employed in the motion picture industry, working alongside Tom Mix, Douglas Fairbanks and William S. Hart on early Hollywood Westerns.

Standing Bear was critical of Hollywood's portrayals of Native Americans, and wanted only Native Americans to play Native Americans and appear on the screen in leading and meaningful roles. In 1926, along with other Indian actors in Hollywood, he created the \\"War Paint Club.\\"See \\"Indian Actors Bury the Hatchet in Hollywood 'War Paint Club'\\", Christian Science Monitor, November 24, 1926, p.5A. Ten years later, Standing Bear joined Jim Thorpe in creating the Indian Actors Association to protect rights and characters of Native American actors from defamation or ridicule.See, Angela Aleiss, \\"Making The White Man's Indian: Native Americans And Hollywood Movies\\", (2005), p.54.  Luther Standing Bear's commentaries  \\"I left reservation life and my native people, the Oglala Sioux, because I was no longer willing to endure existence under the control of an overseer. For about the same number of years I had tried to live a peaceful and happy life; tried to adapt myself and make re-adjustments to fit the white man's mode of existence. But I was unsuccessful. I developed into a chronic disturber. I was a bad Indian, and the agent and I never got along. I remained a hostile, even a savage, if you please. And I still am. I am incurable.\\" — Luther Standing Bear = Protecting Native American heritage and sovereignty = Between 1928 and 1936, Standing Bear wrote four books and a series of articles about protecting Lakota culture and in opposition to government regulation of Native Americans. Standing Bear's commentaries challenged government policies regarding education, assimilation, freedom of religion, tribal sovereignty, return of lands and efforts to convert the Lakota into sedentary farmers. Standing Bear opposed the Dawes Act's policy of privatization of communal holdings of Native American tribes, and was critical of government support of missionaries who undermined Sioux religion, as did the prohibition against the Sun Dance, the most important religious and social event in the yearly cycle of Sioux life.\\"My People the Sioux\\", p.x-xxvii., p.277. \\"Land of the Spotted Eagle\\", p. 254-255. = Books, articles and forums = Standing Bear was one of a small group of Lakota authors of his generation, such as Charles Eastman, Gertrude Bonnin, and Black Elk, who were born and raised in the oral traditions of their culture, educated in white culture, and wrote significant historical accounts of their people and history in English. Left to right: Charles Eastman, Gertrude Bonnin, and Black Elk Between 1928 and 1934, Progressives organized and launched a national education campaign to change government policies towards Native Americans. The campaign began in 1928 with the publication of Standing Bear's book “My People the Sioux” and the release of John Collier's Meriam Report. During this period, Standing Bear published four books and numerous articles to educate the public about Lakota culture, and toured the forums of the American lecture circuit building critical support for an \\"Indian New Deal.\\" Standing Bear was at the forefront of the Progressive movement and his commentaries educated the American public, deepened awareness and created popular support to change government policies toward Native American peoples. At the time, Native American authors were a rarity, and Standing Bear's books were considered culturally significant and reviewed by The New York Times.\\"My People the Sioux\\", p. xxi. In 1931, Standing Bear published My Indian Boyhood, a classic memoir of life, experience and education of a Lakota child in the late 1800s. That year, after an absence of 20 years, he visited Pine Ridge, South Dakota. He was so distressed by the desperate plight of his people that he wrote \\"The Tragedy of the Sioux\\" in American Mercury condemning federal Indian policy for the continued destruction of the Lakota.The American Mercury, (1931), p.273. Land of the Spotted Eagle, published in 1933, is an ethnographic description of traditional Lakota life and customs, criticizing whites' efforts to \\"make over\\" the Indian into the likeness of the white race.Agonito p.250-251. In 1933, Standing Bear also published What the Indian Means to America.James E. Seelye, Jr. and Steven A. Littleton, Editors, \\"Voices of the American Indian Experience\\", (2013), p.508. In 1934, he published a collection of Lakota tales and legends in Stories of the Sioux.  Standing Bear and the Indian New Deal  Standing Bear was at the forefront of the Progressive movement, and he joined with advocate John Collier, the Indian Rights Association, and others to protect Native American religion and sovereignty. His commentaries on Native American culture and wisdom educated the American public, deepened public awareness, and created popular support to change in government policies toward Native American peoples. In 1928, Standing Bear's My People the Sioux and the Meriam Report were published, launching an organized campaign to challenge government policies limiting Native American religion and sovereignty.The Meriam Report revealed the failures of federal Indian policies and how they had contributed to severe problems with Indian education, health and poverty. Prior to this time, criticism of the Bureau of Indian Affairs had been directed at corrupt and incompetent officials rather than the policies. This campaign fought against legislation and policies that were detrimental to Native Americans. Between 1928 and 1934, Luther Standing Bear published four books and numerous articles to educate the public about Lakota culture, and toured the forums of the American lecture circuit building critical support for a \\"Indian New Deal.\\" In 1933, Collier was appointed commissioner for the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the President Franklin D. Roosevelt administration, and Standing Bear wrote to President Franklin D. Roosevelt that Congress should legislate that the history and culture of Native Americans be made part of the curriculum of public schools.Agonito, p. 252. The next year, Collier introduced what became known as the Indian New Deal with Congress' passage of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, legislation reversing 50 years of assimilation policies by emphasizing Indian self- determination and the Dawes Act's policy of privatization of communal holdings of Native American tribes.Collier emerged as a federal Indian policy reformer in 1922 and strongly criticized the Bureau of Indian Affairs policies and implementation of the Dawes Act. His work led Congress to commission a study in 1926–1927 of the overall condition of Indians in the United States. The results were called the Meriam Report. Collier served as Commissioner for the Bureau of Indian Affairs from 1933–1945. Standing Bear's essay \\"The Tragedy of the Sioux\\" and his book Land of Spotted Eagle were published near the end of the Progressive campaign and had wide impact influencing Collier's Indian New Deal policies and fighting to restore tribal culture and sovereignty.Agonito, p. 253. Land of the Spotted Eagle, p.xi.  Death  On February 20, 1939, Luther Standing Bear died in Huntington Beach, California, at age of 79 of the flu while on the set of the film Union Pacific. He was buried in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery, Los Angeles, far from his Lakota homeland, with his sacred pipe.
