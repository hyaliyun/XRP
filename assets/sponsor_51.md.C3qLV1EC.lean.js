Biography B√ºchner was born at Darmstadt on 29 March 1824. From 1842 to 1848 he studied physics, chemistry, botany, mineralogy, philosophy and medicine at the University of Giessen, where he graduated in 1848 with a dissertation entitled Beitr√§ge zur Hall'schen Lehre von einem excitomotorischen Nervensystem (Contributions to the Hallerian Theory of an Excitomotor Nervous System). Afterwards, he continued his studies at the University of Strasbourg, the University of W√ºrzburg (where he studied pathology with the great Rudolf Virchow) and the University of Vienna. In 1852 he became lecturer in medicine at the University of T√ºbingen, where he published his magnum opus Kraft und Stoff: Empirisch- naturphilosophische Studien (Force and Matter: Empiricophilosophical Studies, 1855).Available online at archive.org. In this work, the product, according to Friedrich Albert Lange (Geschichte des Materialismus, 1866), of a fanatical enthusiasm for humanity, he sought to demonstrate the indestructibility of matter, and the finality of physical force. The extreme scientific materialism of this work caused so much opposition that he was compelled to give up his post at T√ºbingen, and he retired to Darmstadt, where he practiced as a physician and contributed regularly to pathological and physiological magazines. He continued his philosophical work in defense of materialism, and published Natur und Geist (Nature and Spirit, 1857), Aus Natur und Wissenschaft (From Nature and Science, vol. I., 1862; vol. II., 1884), Der Fortschritt in Natur und Geschichte im Lichte der Darwinschen Theorie (Progress in Nature and History in the Light of the Darwinian Theory, 1884), Tatsachen und Theorien aus dem naturwissenschaftlichen Leben der Gegenwart (Facts and Theories in the Scientific Life of Present, 1887), Fremdes und Eigenes aus dem geistligen Leben der Gegenwart (Strangers and Selves in the Spiritual Life of the Present, 1890), Darwinismus und Socialismus (Darwinism and Socialism, 1894), Im Dienste der Wahrheit (In the Service of Truth, 1899). Ludwig B√ºchner's materialism was the founding ground for the freethinkers' movement in Germany. In 1881 he founded in Frankfurt the \\"German Freethinkers League\\" (\\"Deutsche Freidenkerbund\\"). He died at Darmstadt on 30 April 1899.This death announcement, in The Zoologist, 4th series, vol. 3 (1899), issue 696, p. 280, gives 30 April as the date of death. Philosophical work In estimating B√ºchner's philosophy it must be remembered that he was primarily a physiologist, not a metaphysician. Matter and force (or energy) are, he maintained, infinite; the conservation of force follows from the imperishability of matter, the ultimate basis of all science. B√ºchner is not always clear in his theory of the relation between matter and force. At one time he refuses to explain it, but generally he assumes that all natural and spiritual forces are indwelling in matter. Just as a steam engine, he says in Kraft und Stoff (7th ed., p. 130), produces motion, so the intricate organic complex of force-bearing substance in an animal organism produces a total sum of certain effects, which, when bound together in a unity, are called by us mind, soul, thought. Here he postulates force and mind as emanating from original matter, a materialistic monism. But in other parts of his works he suggests that mind and matter are two different aspects of that which is the basis of all things, a monism which is not necessarily materialistic. B√ºchner was much less concerned to establish a scientific metaphysics than to protest against the romantic idealism of his predecessors and the theological interpretations of the universe. Nature according to him is purely physical; it has no purpose, no will, no laws imposed by extraneous authority, no supernatural ethical sanction. Modern Christian apologists consider B√ºchner the father of atheistic evangelism in Germany, a counterpart to Thomas Huxley. Ludwig B√ºchner was the brother of Georg B√ºchner, a famous playwright, and Luise B√ºchner, a women's rights advocate; and the uncle of Ernst B√ºchner, inventor of the B√ºchner flask.

They are pigmented with bacteriochlorophyll a or b, together with various carotenoids, which give them colours ranging between purple, red, brown, and orange. They may be divided into two groups - purple sulfur bacteria (Chromatiales, in part) and purple non-sulfur bacteria (Rhodospirillaceae).  Metabolism  Purple bacteria are mainly photoautotrophic, but are also known to be chemoautotrophic and photoheterotrophic. They can be mixotrophs, capable of aerobic respiration and fermentation.  Location  Photosynthesis occurs at reaction centers on the cell membrane, where the photosynthetic pigments (i.e. bacteriochlorophyll, carotenoids) and pigment-binding proteins are invaginated to form vesicle sacs, tubules, or single-paired or stacked lamellar sheets. This is called the intracytoplasmic membrane (ICM), which has increased surface area to maximize light absorption. The purple non-sulfur bacterium Rhodospirillum  Mechanism  Purple bacteria use cyclic electron transport driven by a series of redox reactions. Light-harvesting complexes surrounding a reaction centre (RC) harvest photons in the form of resonance energy, exciting chlorophyll pigments P870 or P960 located in the RC. Excited electrons are cycled from P870 to quinones QA and QB, then passed to cytochrome bc1, cytochrome c2, and back to P870. The reduced quinone QB attracts two cytoplasmic protons and becomes QH2, eventually being oxidized and releasing the protons to be pumped into the periplasm by the cytochrome bc1 complex. The resulting charge separation between the cytoplasm and periplasm generates a proton motive force used by ATP synthase to produce ATP energy.  Electron donors for anabolism  Purple bacteria also transfer electrons from external electron donors directly to cytochrome bc1 to generate NADH or NADPH used for anabolism. They are anoxygenic because they do not use water as an electron donor to produce oxygen. One type of purple bacteria, called purple sulfur bacteria (PSB), use sulfide or sulfur as electron donors. Another type, called purple non-sulfur bacteria, typically use hydrogen as an electron donor, but can also use sulfide or organic compounds at lower concentrations compared to PSB. Purple bacteria lack external electron carriers to spontaneously reduce NAD(P)+ to NAD(P)H, so they must use their reduced quinones to endergonically reduce NAD(P)+. This process is driven by the proton motive force and is called reverse electron flow.  History  Purple bacteria were the first bacteria discovered to photosynthesize without having an oxygen byproduct. Instead, their byproduct is sulfur. This was demonstrated by first establishing the bacteria's reactions to different concentrations of oxygen. It was found that the bacteria moved quickly away from even the slightest trace of oxygen. Then a dish of the bacteria was taken, and a light was focused on one part of the dish, leaving the rest dark. As the bacteria cannot survive without light, all the bacteria moved into the circle of light, becoming very crowded. If the bacteria's byproduct was oxygen, the distances between individuals would become larger and larger as more oxygen was produced. But because of the bacteria's behavior in the focused light, it was concluded that the bacteria's photosynthetic byproduct could not be oxygen. In a 2018 article, it has been suggested that purple bacteria can be used as a biorefinery.  Evolution  Researchers have theorized that some purple bacteria are related to the mitochondria, symbiotic bacteria in plant and animal cells today that act as organelles. Comparisons of their protein structure suggests that there is a common ancestor.  Taxonomy  Purple non-sulfur bacteria are found among the alpha and beta subgroups, including: * Rhodospirillales ** Rhodospirillaceae, e.g. Rhodospirillum rubrum ** Acetobacteraceae, e.g. Rhodopila globiformis * Rhizobiales ** Bradyrhizobiaceae, e.g. Rhodopseudomonas palustris ** Hyphomicrobiaceae, e.g. Rhodomicrobium ** Rhodobiaceae, e.g. Rhodobium * Other families ** Rhodobacteraceae, e.g. Rhodobacter ** Rhodocyclaceae, e.g. Rhodocyclus ** Comamonadaceae, e.g. Rhodoferax Purple sulfur bacteria are included among the gamma subgroup and make up the order Chromatiales. The similarity between the photosynthetic machinery in these different lines indicates that it had a common origin, either from some common ancestor or passed by lateral transfer.

He attended Ballyclare High School from 1971 to 1976. To achieve his ambition of becoming an army officer after taking his O levels, Strawbridge enrolled at a sixth form college in Nottinghamshire before going on to Sandhurst. Army career Strawbridge received a commission in the British Army in 1979, after attending Welbeck DSFC (becoming head of college) and Sandhurst. He joined the Royal Corps of Signals in January 1980. Promoted to Lieutenant in April 1981, and Captain in October 1985, he became a Major in September 1991. He was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1993 for his distinguished service in Northern Ireland, promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in June 1999, and left the army in November 2001. Television career Strawbridge has appeared as an engineering and environmental expert on various television programmes, including Scrapheap Challenge. He first appeared as a contestant on the team Brothers in Arms who became series champions and later, he became the main presenter replacing Robert Llewellyn. He has also appeared on three series of It's Not Easy Being Green for BBC Two, the six-part BBC Two series Crafty Tricks of War of which he was the main presenter, Planet Mechanics, and as a regular guest presenter on Coast. Following his switch of career to television, Strawbridge often refers to himself as a \\"telly tart\\". Scrapheap Challenge Strawbridge began his career in television as the 'Yellow Team Leader' for six episodes in the first series of 'Scrapheap'. He has to date appeared in over 30 programmes of Scrapheap Challenge and Junkyard Wars, winning the Scrapheap Challenge trophy in series 3 with his two younger brothers David and Bobby as 'Brothers in Arms', and the Junkyard Megawars trophy in 2003. On 5 June 2008, it was announced that he would be returning to Scrapheap Challenge for its 11th series. Strawbridge took over from Robert Llewellyn as the main presenter. The series was shown on Channel 4 in 2009. It's Not Easy Being Green Strawbridge, along with his family, filmed three series of It's Not Easy Being Green for BBC Two. In series one, which was shown on 28 March 2006, the family moved to a new home in Tywardreath near St Austell, Cornwall and attempted to live as green a life as possible, using renewable energy and environmentally friendly resources. The second series started in Spring 2007 with a different format: Strawbridge and his son James aided several members of the public in larger and smaller ecology projects around the country. Coast Also in 2006, Strawbridge appeared as a one-off presenter on the BBC2 series Coast, examining the workings of the Middlesbrough Transporter Bridge, a role he revived in the 2007 version of Coast, presenting a short part of the programme on the failure of Exercise Tiger. In Series 4 of Coast, July 2009, Strawbridge examined the terrain of the Normandy landing beaches. The Hungry Sailors and Saturday Farm In 2011, Strawbridge and his son James filmed a 20 part series, The Hungry Sailors, which was broadcast by ITV in which they sailed around Britain's coastline buying local food and then cooking it. In 2012, filming began on a second series of The Hungry Sailors around the Cornish coast, taking in the Channel Islands and the Isles of Scilly. The series was broadcast from 1 July 2013. In 2013, Strawbridge and his son James presented ITV Food series Saturday Farm. Escape to the Ch√¢teau This programme followed Strawbridge and his partner (now wife), Angel Adoree, through their purchase in 2015 and subsequent renovation of Ch√¢teau de la Motte-Husson in Martign√©-sur-Mayenne, France. Dirty Rotten Survival Filmed in America from March to July 2015, this TV series for National Geographic involved a 25-mile hike through the Berkshire Mountains of western Massachusetts, with Dave Canterbury and Johnny Littlefield. Other television appearances Strawbridge also had a major role in the BBC's commemoration of the 60th anniversary of D-Day, and he was the co-host and resident \\"boffin\\" on the 2005 game show, Geronimo!. He also appeared as a regular team captain in the US series, Junkyard Mega-Wars. Strawbridge also starred in The Big Idea, in which he tested out amateur inventions, and he featured in the short series The Re- Inventors, a series of five, hour-long programmes commissioned by the UK digital channel UKTV History and first broadcast through the week of 11 December 2006. Each episode featured Strawbridge and his son James reconstructing an invention of historic significance, with a budget of ¬£500 and their mobile workshop. They then try it out against the real thing. UKTV History also shows \\"Crafty Tricks Of War\\" from time to time. On the 21 February 2008 edition of Ready Steady Cook on BBC2, Strawbridge cooked spotted dick. Strawbridge currently presents Planet Mechanics on the National Geographic Channel. On 13 November 2009, Strawbridge was a guest on Robert Llewellyn's CarPool. In summer 2010, he appeared in Celebrity Masterchef, reaching the final alongside Christine Hamilton and eventual winner Lisa Faulkner. On 20 November 2010, Strawbridge appeared on the Children in Need Special of Bargain Hunt. In 2012, Strawbridge was announced as presenter of new Channel 5 series Beat the Ancestors, which commenced broadcast in February 2013. In 2016, he was announced as a co-host of the three-part BBC Four series Trainspotting Live, which was broadcast in July 2016. In 2017, Strawbridge presented Cabins in the Wild with Will Hardie, a show following a competition set up by the Welsh Tourist Board. Eight competitors were selected based on their designs to build cabins, intended to be combined as a hotel in the countryside, before one ultimate winner was selected. The two presenters also constructed their own cabin. In 2018, Channel 4 broadcast a programme called The Biggest Little Railway in the World, which documented an attempt to get a model train to traverse the Great Glen Way between Fort William and Inverness. Strawbridge was the main presenter and lead engineer on the project. Personal life Strawbridge married Brigit A. Weiner in 1982,Richard Francis Strawbridge in the England & Wales, Civil Registration Marriage Index, 1916-2005 with whom he has two children, James George (b. 1984) and Charlotte Elizabeth (b. 1986).

He is also co-founder, with Joel Weinberger, of Implicit Strategies, a market research firm that measures consumers' unconscious responses to advertising and brands.Implicit Strategies - Who we are Early life and education He grew up in North Carolina and Georgia, and received a Bachelor of Arts from Harvard University, a Master of Arts in Social and Political Thought from the University of Sussex (England), and a Doctor of Philosophy in clinical psychology from the University of Michigan, where he taught introductory psychology from 1985 to 1991. Career Westen is a strategic messaging consultant for major nonprofit organizations and has been a consultant or advisor to progressive and Democratic organizations, including the House and Senate Democratic Caucuses. In addition, Westen is a commentator on television, radio, in print, and online, who has been a frequent contributor to the opinion page of the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, CNN.com and the Huffington Post. His 2011 article on Obama's leadership in the Sunday New York Times was one of the most widely read pieces in the history of the Sunday Times and drew considerable attention, including from the White House. The President and his close advisors were so incensed and concerned about its impact, because it captured popular opinion at the time about his leadership style, that they sent out a thirty-plus page email of talking points to friendly journalists to use when he was interviewed on television and radio.  Research  His academic research spans over many areas, most of it focused on the assessment, classification, and diagnosis of mental disorders in adults and adolescents, with a particular focus on personality disorders, although he has also done research on eating disorders, unconscious processes, mood disorders, the psychological processes underlying the capacity or incapacity to maintain intimate relationships, attachment, psychological anthropology, social and affective neuroscience, and a number of other topics. He has made numerous contributions to the literature in psychoanalysis, attempting to integrate it with empirical psychology, psychiatry, and neuroscience. He has expressed concern, however, that psychoanalysts should not only be able to diagnose psychological dynamics but also to be able to make traditional diagnoses, which often have treatment implications that a single-minded focus on psychoanalytic case formulation should not, but often does, obscure their vision. After several years at the University of Michigan, he then moved to Harvard University, where he was Associate Professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Chief Psychologist at the Cambridge Hospital. At Harvard University and at Emory, Westen's work has focused on alternative ways of assessing and classifying personality disorders and developing and refining the Shedler-Westen Assessment Procedure as a tool for researchers and clinicians to help further the understanding of personality and its disorders. He is unusual among academic clinical psychologists in being both an active researcher and a practicing clinician for 20 years, who has written on what can be learned from both science and practice. This is reflected in over a decade's work on how to revise the diagnostic manual in psychiatry so that it is useful both to clinicians and researchers. Much of Westen's theoretical work has attempted to bridge perspectives, particularly cognitive, psychodynamic, and evolutionary. He has published over 200 research papers in the scientific literature.http://www.psychsystems.net/lab/type4.cfm?id=400&section;=4&source;=200&source2;=1  Political bias study  In January 2006 a group of scientists led by Westen announced at the annual Society for Personality and Social Psychology conference in Palm Springs, California the results of a study in which functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) showed that self-described Democrats and Republicans responded to negative remarks about their political candidate of choice in systematically biased ways. Specifically, when Republican test subjects were shown self-contradictory quotes by George W. Bush and when Democratic test subjects were shown self-contradictory quotes by John Kerry, both groups tended to explain away the apparent contradictions in a manner biased to favor their candidate of choice. Similarly, areas of the brain responsible for reasoning (notably the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex Westen, Drew; Blagov, Pavel S.; Harenski, Keith; Kilts, Clint; Hamann, Stephan (2006), \\"Neural Bases of Motivated Reasoning: An fMRI Study of Emotional Constraints on Partisan Political Judgment in the 2004 U.S. Presidential Election\\", Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) 18 (11): 1947‚Äì1958, , , retrieved 2009-08-14) did not respond during the time subjects were coming to these conclusions, whereas circuits involved in processing negative emotion (e.g., the insular gurus), conflict monitoring and resolution (the anterior cingulate), and what the researchers presumed to be unconscious emotion regulation (neural activity in the ventromedial and orbital prefrontal cortex) showed increased activity as compared to the subjects‚Äô responses to politically neutral statements associated with politically neutral people (such as Tom Hanks). Subjects were then presented with information that exonerated their candidate of choice. When this occurred, areas of the brain involved in reward (notably dopamine- rich regions such as the striatum / nucleus accumbens) showed increased activity, essentially reinforcing both their positive feelings toward their favored candidate and defensive reasoning. Westen said, : None of the circuits involved in conscious reasoning were particularly engaged... Essentially, it appears as if partisans twirl the cognitive kaleidoscope until they get the conclusions they want... Everyone... may reason to emotionally biased judgments when they have a vested interest in how to interpret 'the facts.' The study was published in the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience 18:11, pp. 1947‚Äì58, a peer-reviewed scientific journal.  Books  In 2007, PublicAffairs published Westen's The Political Brain.The Political Brain The book has been widely used by political candidates and leaders around the world and is credited as having influenced campaign strategies in a number of races, beginning with the 2008 Presidential race.

He served as a member of the Dillingham Immigration Commission from 1907 - 1914, where he led research projects on the current state of immigration into the United States. He authored several influential books, including The Immigration Problem: A Study of Immigration Conditions and Need and The Dictionary of Races. He was among the first social science academics within government, and one of the first to propose that the federal government has the power to restrict immigration.  Biography  Born in Saint Clair, Michigan, Jenks graduated from the University of Michigan in 1878. He then went on to study law while teaching at Mount Morris College in Illinois, and was admitted to the Michigan bar in 1881. He later studied in Germany, earning his doctorate from the University of Halle under Johannes Conrad in 1885. Jenks held professorships at both Cornell University (1891‚Äì1912) as a member of the President White School of History and Political Science and New York University (1912 onward). He began his career in service for the federal government as a tax commissioner in New York City, and soon moved onto hold various posts within the federal government. Theodore Roosevelt appointed him in 1899 to be an ‚Äúexpert in Asia‚Äù for the U.S. treasury, and represented the US in financial matters within several Asian countries. Jenks soon became an advisor to Mexico, Nicaragua, and Germany as well, quickly advancing through the ranks of the federal government. Jenks was appointed a member of the U.S. Commission on International Exchange, and was appointed to the United States Immigration Commission in 1907. The National Civic Federation, an organization of big business owners and labor organizers, also hired him and his work there became inspirational for his studies on labor. Jenks was recognized with the Silver Buffalo Award in 1926. Today, he is remembered for his association with Nobel laureate Friedrich Hayek, and his legacy in American immigration policy.  Economics  Jenks was interested in the political aspects of economic problems and he served frequently on various government commissions and made many reports on currency, labor, and immigration issues. Jenks was part of the new school of economic theory during the Progressive Era, which stemmed through his dissertation adviser at the University of Halle, Joseph Conrad, who was an outspoken critic of British Classical Economics. Progressive Era economists focused on making economics compatible with morality, and sought to institute governmental regulations which were favorable to large corporations. Jenks toured the world for the War Department from 1901-1902, where he examined how dependent colonial governments operated financially. He made many other trips around the world as a member of the Commission on International Exchange, where he researched colonial policy and the gold standard in countries all over the world. Based on these experiences, Jenks wrote a chapter in Henry Cabot Lodge‚Äôs book Colonies of the World. Progressive economists and Jenks founded the American Economic Association, where he served as president from 1906 - 1907. One of the association's goals was the ‚Äúdevelopment of legislative policy‚Äù, which radical for its time as many of the old school economists of the time still strongly believed in the idea of strict laissez-faire economics. The reformist ideology of the American Economic Association affected his work as a member of the National Civic Federation (NCF). The National Civic Federation was a business-dominated organization that aligned with the ideologies of reformist minded economists like Jenks, as it sought to implement uniform state legislation on multiple issues including worker's compensation, child labor, and taxation. Additionally, the NCF gave Jenks his first exposure to immigration issues, as in 1905 he attended a conference that focused on whether immigrant labor from China should be more restricted. He also served as an economic adviser at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. Jenks‚Äô experiences abroad influenced his views on U.S. colonialism. Although many Republican reformers were anti-imperialist, Jenks was an outspoken proponent of US colonialism and expansion. He saw American colonial intervention as a way to offset inefficiencies produced by the native populations, and a way to bring them to the moral standards of America. Jenks‚Äô experiences abroad also gave him the idea that the US had the right to exercise federal power across the globe, particularly when it came to immigration.  Politics  In the Progressive Era, Jeremiah Jenks was one of the pioneers who set the precedent for the inclusion of professors and academic experts in government. In 1899, Jenks was appointed as an ‚Äúexpert in Asia‚Äù for the US treasury, and began traveling to various dependent countries around the world. Jenks‚Äô experience in politics stemmed from his involvement in various economic and immigration research organizations. As a member of the NCF, Jenks helped to draft a bill to amend the Sherman Anti-Trust Act in 1908. Although the bill was ultimately unsuccessful, Jenks sat on the four-man committee headed by John Bates Clark which drafted a preliminary version of the 1914 Clayton Anti-trust Act. With the Immigration Commission, he wrote model legislation for the Mann Act of 1910, which focused on the restriction of white slavery and sex trafficking into the United States. Jenks was instrumental in the writing and the passage of the Dillingham Immigration Bill of 1911, which was ultimately vetoed by President William Howard Taft. However, this bill was one of the first to restrict immigration on racial grounds, and set the precedent for many restrictionist policies which were soon to be passed by the federal government, such as The National Origins Act of 1924. In 1916, Jenks was also included on a committee led by Sidney Gulick, which sought to end the disproportionate discrimination in the immigration of citizens of Asian countries, and proposed a new model for immigration restrictions. In reality, their proposed plan still instituted quotas for different immigrants based on race, it would just be less exclusionary for members of Asian countries. Throughout his years involved in immigration policy, Jenks gave talks and held conferences on what he termed the racial problem of immigration.  The Dillingham Immigration Commission  Jenks‚Äô most influential and lasting work for the Federal Government came from his membership in the Dillingham Immigration Commission from 1907-1911. The Commission was progressive minded, and was headed by senator William Dillingham, although most of the power rested with Henry Cabot Lodge and Jeremiah Jenks. The commission was convened after the failure of the implementation of a literacy test by congress to limit immigration, and sought to conduct academic research to influence policy on the restriction of immigration. The commission was also formed out of a growing negative sentiment towards immigrants, as a majority of the population growth in the US in this period was result of immigration, and immigrants were increasingly coming from countries in Southern and Eastern Europe. Jenks was instrumental to the work, as he did much of the hiring for the commission and led many of the research projects that the commission undertook. He applied his experiences abroad in different colonies across the world, as he increasingly thought it was the duty of the federal government to place restrictions on immigration into the United States. For his first research project for the commission, Jenks traveled to San Diego to study the urban congestion of Mexican immigrants. It was on this journey that Jenks realized he could enjoy complete autonomy in his research, as he received no interference from the federal government. He then led many studies on the urban congestion, living conditions, and occupations of immigrants from different races. Jenks was also concerned with the effect of immigrants on American morality and hired many women to investigate this effect, particularly in the field of white slavery, or human trafficking. These studies led by Jenks and the Immigration Commission were noted to not conform to research methods as they did not hold any public hearings, nor cross- examine any witnesses. The Commission also did not utilize any data already available to them, such as census reports, studies by state bureaus of labor, or other agencies, in order to come up with their own unique conclusions. Instead it relied heavily on the work of Jenks and Lodge to create their own tables, explanations, and conclusions. The commission concluded with a 41 volume report in 1911 which outlined the current status of immigration, laying out the differences in occupation, crime, and many other things between races of immigrants. This study ultimately labeled some races of immigrants as more desirable than others, and ultimately called for a quota system which would restrict different immigrants based on their desirability. Although the commission's proposed bill was vetoed by President William Howard Taft in 1911, the research of the commission was instrumental in the passage of many immigration restrictions in the years to come, including the 1924 National Origins Act. Scholar Mae Ngai notes the racial aspects of this legislation, as she says the language of eugenics dominated the political discourse on immigration during this period. The Dillingham Commission divided the immigrants they studied by ethnicity and race, thus showing how they fed into the language of eugenics and the ideology of the National Origins Act of 1924. All of this work by The Immigration Commission set the precedent restricting immigration into the United States was necessary duty of the federal government.  Scout Oath and Scout Law  A commission under Jenks with other prominent educators drew up the Scout Oath and Scout Law for the Boy Scouts of America. The principal differences from the originals suggested by Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell, the founder of Scouting, were the addition to the Scout Oath of the sentence \\"to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake and morally straight\\" and of three additional points to the Scout Law- \\"A Scout is brave\\", \\"A Scout is clean\\", and \\"A Scout is reverent\\". In 1912 Baden-Powell adopted \\"A Scout is clean in thought, word and deed\\" as a tenth law to his own original nine.  Works = The Immigration Problem: A Study of American Immigration Conditions and Needs  One of Jenks' most influential publications was written with the help of his hire for the Immigration Commission, Jett Lauck. It was a research study conducted on different races of immigrants in US society with the goals of fixing a standard of civilization for the United States, securing all the facts about immigration, measuring immigrants‚Äô influence on the standard of civilization, and suggesting measures for the US government to implement to correct these problems. Jenks and Lauck conduct research studies on criminal immigrants, human trafficking, and immigrant living conditions over the US. After studying a mine in northern Pennsylvania, they came to the conclusion that immigrants were reducing the standard of civilization for all Americans, which was to negatively affect their morality. They also conducted studies on the difference in occupation of immigrants from different countries, and concluded that they had negative impact on labor unions, as they were frequently employed as strikebreakers. In the section entitled ‚ÄúAre Other Races Inferior?‚Äù, Jenks questions the idea of inferior races of immigrants. He states, ‚Äú... whether or not we ourselves believe that race prejudice is something to be heartily condemned, we must still recognize this feeling as an important political fact.‚Äù Jenks comes to the conclusion that racial prejudice isn't a personal issue, but a political one. The book concludes that pre-war immigration was too large for the economic welfare of the US, and a new naturalization law was required. Jenks and Lauck's perspective on racial prejudice was relevant in the policy suggestions of the book, which suggested different quotas for different races of immigrants, as some were easier to be trained and assimilated into American society. This book was one of the first to advocate immigration restriction by federal government legislation. It is also important because it was the first to coin the term ‚Äú the immigration problem‚Äù, a phrase which is still used in the United States Government today. Jenks and Lauck argued that immigration adversely economic outcomes for native-born Americans. A 2019 study by several economic historians found that the immigration restrictions that Jenks advocated for did not improve economic outcomes for native-born Americans.  Dictionary of Races  Jenks and his key staff assistant, anthropologist Daniel Folkmar collaborated on an extensive Dictionary of Races that became an important feature of the Commission's report to Congress. In their Dictionary of Races, Jenks and Folkmar stated that their principal task was to discover \\"whether there may not be certain races that are inferior to other races... to show whether some may be better fitted for American citizenship than others.\\" The Dictionary, along with other commission reports, was cited frequently in subsequent immigration debates.  Selected publications  His books include: * Dictionary of Races * The Trust Problem (1900). * The Immigration Problem (with W. J. Lauck, 1911). * Principles of Politics (1909). * Governmental Action for Social Welfare (1910).

Published in 1965, it was her ninth novel. It is set in Dublin during the week leading up to the Easter Rising of 1916, and is her only historical novel. Its characters are members of a complexly inter-related Anglo-Irish family who differ in their religious affiliations and in their views on the relations between England and Ireland. The novel combines a thoroughly researched account of the events leading up to the Easter Rising with a complicated sexual farce. It received mixed reviews on its publication. Plot The novel is set in Dublin during the week leading up to the Easter Rising of 1916. All the characters are members of a complexly interrelated Anglo-Irish family. As the story begins Andrew Chase- White is a young Second lieutenant in King Edward's Horse, spending a leave with his family in Ireland before accompanying his regiment to France. Andrew Chase-White grew up in England, the only child of Protestant Anglo-Irish parents. His recently widowed mother Hilda has decided to move to Ireland. Andrew's paternal grandfather was his grandmother's second husband. With her first husband she had two children, Brian and Millicent Dumay. Millicent married Sir Arthur Kinnard and inherited his property when he died young. Brian, who converted to Catholicism as a young man, married Arthur Kinnard's sister Kathleen, who also converted. They had two sons, Pat (Andrew's contemporary) and his younger brother Cathal Dumay, both ardent supporters of independence for Ireland. After Brian's death Kathleen married Andrew's Roman Catholic uncle Barnabas Drumm, Hilda's brother. A third Kinnard sibling, Heather, married Christopher Bellman and died young. Christopher's only child is Frances, whom Andrew has known all his life and plans to marry. When Andrew and Frances visit Kathleen, Pat and Cathal in their house in Dublin, Andrew is goaded into taunting Pat with his failure to enlist in the British Army. The following day Andrew, Hilda, and Christopher call on Millicent in her Dublin house. Unknown to his family, Christopher is in love with Millie, whom he has been helping financially for several years, and has been trying to convince her to marry him. This is complicated by the fact that Frances dislikes Millie, but he is encouraged by the expectation that Andrew and Frances will soon marry. Millie promises to come to Christopher's house later in the week to give him her answer. Pat's stepfather Barnabas Drumm is another of Millie's admirers. Years before, his passion for Millie had led to his leaving the seminary where he was training for the priesthood. His marriage to Kathleen proving unhappy, he reconnected with Millie and became a frequent visitor at her house, where he has the status of a tolerated relation. When Millie goes to Christopher's house to tell him she will accept his marriage proposal, their conversation is overheard by Barnabas. Millie has allowed her cellar to be used as an arms depository by the Irish Volunteers. Pat Dumay, an officer in the organization, has been informed that an armed insurrection is planned for Easter Sunday, and comes to inspect the weapons. He encounters Millie, who informs him that she is in love with him and invites him to Rathblane, her country house in the Wicklow Mountains. Shocked, he runs away. Andrew asks Frances to marry him, and is surprised and devastated when she refuses. Later he goes to Rathblane and confides in Millie that he is not engaged to Frances and that he is a virgin. Millie kisses him and offers to initiate him sexually, but he refuses her offer and leaves. Pat and Cathal are bitterly disappointed on Saturday, when the insurrection in cancelled. In despair, Pat goes to Rathblane on Saturday night, and finds that Millie is already in bed with Andrew. He rushes out of the house, just as Christopher is arriving unexpectedly. Millie tells Christopher that she will not marry him after all, and that she has seduced Andrew and is in love with Pat. On Monday morning Andrew goes to Pat's house, unaware of the rising rescheduled for that day. Pat takes him prisoner and leaves him handcuffed to Cathal in order to keep Cathal out of the fighting. They are freed just as the insurrection is starting and the novel ends with Andrew and Cathal observing the beginning of the rising in front of the General Post Office. An epilogue set in 1938 briefly describes the later lives and deaths of several of the protagonists. Major themes The Red and the Green is the only historical novel by Iris Murdoch. Murdoch, though born in Dublin to Protestant parents, left Ireland as an infant and spent her life in England. She undertook extensive research into Irish history in preparation for writing the novel. There is considerable debate and discussion about Irish history and nationalist politics throughout the novel, chiefly carried on by Christopher Bellman and Pat and Cathal Dumay. Murdoch does not show an obvious political bias, but the book leans toward \\"the liberal Irish patriotism of the Anglo-Irish\\". Incest is an important theme in the novel, and a common topic in Murdoch's fiction, in which a \\"quasi-incestuous competition of members of one family for a single beloved is ubiquitous\\" as are actual incestuous relationships. The baffling complexity of Andrew's family, a source of pride for his mother, is characterized by Millie as \\"practically incestuous\\". Besides going to bed with Andrew, who calls her \\"Aunt Millie\\", and trying to seduce her nephew Pat, she claims to have had a sexual relationship with her half brother, Andrew's father. Sexual initiation is one of the themes of the novel. Both Pat and Andrew are virgins who feel \\"a fear of sex and a fixation on long-suffering mothers\\", which the critic Declan Kiberd notes is a \\"complex of attitudes which was by the 1960s being recognized as a pathology\\". The novel has been characterized as part of Murdoch's \\"romantic phase\\" in which she was concerned with \\"the responsibilities, impositions and ties of marriage, or, in the case of The Red and the Green, of religious vocation\\". In this case Barnabas Drumm, while pining for Millie and resenting his virtuous wife Kathleen, is unable to give up his dream of a religious calling, and feels himself to be \\"by vocation a failed priest\\". Several chapters are devoted to Barney's religious crises, in which he wrestles with his feelings of guilt and ineffectually resolves to redeem himself. Reception The Red and the Green was widely reviewed in Ireland, Great Britain, the United States and elsewhere. The reviews were mixed, with several critics finding that the \\"bedroom farce aspect\\" centred on Millie was \\"fatal to the book\\". Christopher Ricks wrote in the New Statesman that Murdoch's attempt to \\"combine a flatly faithful account of what happened in Dublin in 1916 with a love-imbroglio\\" showed \\"honourable and gigantic ambition\\" but resulted in a failed novel in which the \\"sexual permutation game both withers and demeans Irish history\\". Ricks argued that her \\"clockwork\\" characters and contrived plot resulted in fiction that failed to live up to the demands of her own theories of literature. In the New York Times, John Bowen also characterized The Red and the Green as a \\"mechanical novel\\" in which \\"contrivance is piled on contrivance\\", in a manner unworthy of \\"a novelist of this stature\\". Another New York Times reviewer disagreed, calling The Red and the Green a \\"brilliant and entertaining\\" novel with a \\"magnificently wayward heroine\\" in Millie Kinnard and a \\"style that somehow blends the methods of Sartre and Stendhal\\". The Time reviewer was unimpressed by the novel, calling it \\"neither her best book nor her worst\\". The review praised her descriptive writing but called her characters \\"sexually confused, tortured by unexplained feelings of guilt, and totally ineffectual and unbelievable as human beings\\". Murdoch's biographer Peter J. Conradi notes that the Irish reviews were \\"generally good\\", including one by Se√°n √ì Faol√°in in the Irish Times. Benedict Kiely recommended it to American readers as a guidebook to \\"the English and the Irish\\" characters and praised Murdoch's ability to discriminate, \\"with scholastic precision ... between English rain and Irish rain\\".

Feldman has worked with Captain Beefheart, Fear, Snakefinger, The Residents, Pere Ubu, Pixies, dEUS, Katell Keineg, Frank Black, The Polyphonic Spree, Tripping Daisy, Reid Paley, Charlotte Hatherley, Custard and PJ Harvey. He was already an experienced keyboard player when he joined Captain Beefheart's Magic Band in 1976, in which he also played bass. Like other members of the band, Feldman was expected to capture (on tape or notepad) Beefheart's musical ideas. Once instrumental parts had been created, the band members had to play them exactly as composed: \\"I never had a problem with that. I felt like I was getting parts dictated to me from one of the best, especially when they were designed for me. You just feel like a model in a fashion show wearing a really nice dress, I guess.\\" During his time in the Magic Band, he was also given a nickname by Don, Black Jew Kitabu. Feldman worked on the acclaimed trio of Beefheart albums in the late 1970s and early 1980s that turned out to be the last of the Captain's musical career, Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller) (1978), Doc at the Radar Station (1980), and Ice Cream for Crow (1982). In May 1984, Feldman collaborated with Steve LeGrand of the band Times Beach to compose and perform the score to Sam Shephard's \\"The Tooth of Crime\\" in an acclaimed production at the Berkeley Repertory Theatre. After working with The Residents' Snakefinger, in 1988 Feldman was drafted in to replace departing Pere Ubu keyboard player Allen Ravenstine. He worked on their album Worlds in Collision (1991). Feldman met the Pixies' Frank Black in 1991, when Pere Ubu were touring as the Pixies' opening act, and later played keyboards on the Pixies' Trompe le Monde (1991) and toured with them. He can also be seen in the video for \\"Alec Eiffel\\". Eric's brother Jef also played on the song \\"Space (I Believe In)\\" from the same record and was the inspiration behind its lyrics. After the Pixies split, Feldman worked with Frank Black on his solo albums Frank Black (1993) and Teenager of the Year (1994), producing, arranging and also playing bass and keyboards. In 1994, after two Frank Black albums, Feldman applied for a job with PJ Harvey, who was putting together a band. He played on Is This Desire? (1998), White Chalk (2007), the PJ Harvey/John Parish album A Woman A Man Walked By (2009), and has regularly toured with her. His band kNIFE & fORK has opened for her. While in Australia touring with Frank Black he met the Australian band Custard. He recorded two albums with them in the USA; Wisenheimer (1995) and We Have the Technology (1996). In 1996, he produced In a Bar, Under the Sea by Belgian band dEUS. Two years later, he produced Jesus Hits Like the Atom Bomb by Dallas group Tripping Daisy. He later produced Together We're Heavy (2004) by The Polyphonic Spree, a 24-member troupe containing three ex-members of Tripping Daisy. He also produced the album Revival (2000) by Brooklyn singer-songwriter (and sometime Frank Black songwriting collaborator) Reid Paley. Through the 1990s Feldman continued to tour on and off with Frank Black and the Catholics and joined the band in the studio to make Dog in the Sand (2000), Black Letter Days, Devil's Workshop, and Show Me Your Tears, as well producing the unreleased album Sunday Sunny Mill Valley Groove Day. In the song 85 Weeks from 1999's Pistolero Frank Black retells a story about Captain Beefheart as told to Black and other band members by Feldman (the opening lines of \\"Once Eric said, 'Come gather 'round. I'll tell a tale that is sure to astound'\\" make a clear reference to Feldman). Since Feldman did not participate in the production of Pistolero the incident may date back to an earlier recording session. On April 25, 2008, Eric performed live with Black Francis at the San Francisco International Film Festival at the Castro Theatre. Black Francis and his band performed the original score The Golem, which Eric produced, for the 1920 silent movie The Golem: How He Came into the World. In 2009 he co- produced and played on a new collaboration entitled NonStopErotik, released March 2010. They toured together briefly as a three-piece to support the album.

Gipson refuses to accept the check and voices his desire to \\"do this right\\", but Banek, whose car is still drivable, insists upon leaving immediately. He leaves Gipson stranded, telling him, \\"better luck next time\\". After arriving to the court late, Gipson learns that the judge ruled against him in his absence, giving sole custody of the boys to Gipson's wife and allowing her to proceed with a plan to move to Oregon, never knowing that Gipson was about to buy a house locally and give it to his wife and children as part of his effort to make joint custody workable for everyone. When Banek gets to court, he realizes that he dropped the crucial power of appointment file at the scene of the accident, and the judge gives him until the end of the day to retrieve it. Gipson, who scooped up the file, is torn, and initially refuses to return the file. Banek, who is desperate to get his papers back, goes to a \\"fixer\\", a shady computer hacker, and gets him to switch off Gipson's credit, destroying Gipson's chance for a home loan to keep his family together. Gipson is distraught when he finds out his credit has been ruined and he comes close to drinking again. Determined to get back at Banek, Gipson removes several lug nuts from one of Banek's wheels, and Banek suffers some minor injuries after his car crashes on the highway. An infuriated Banek goes to the elementary school of Gipson's children and tells school officials that Gipson plans to kidnap the boys, so Gipson is arrested and jailed. His enraged wife declares her intention to move forward with taking their sons to Oregon and says that Gipson will never see them again. Both men, shaken by the consequences of their actions, start to reconsider their desire for vengeance and try to find a way out. Although it appears unlikely that either man will achieve what he had hoped, both resolve to let go and do what is right, and the two men apologize to each other. Gipson returns the file containing the power of appointment, which Banek has since learned was obtained illegally, and he uses it to blackmail his boss to conduct business honestly and get approval to represent Gipson pro bono to resolve his legal troubles. Banek also visits Gipson's wife, asking her to \\"give me five minutes.\\" The next day, Gipson is walking and notices his wife and sons standing across the street, smiling at him.

Rosamond Johnson)Black Past was an American composer and singer during the Harlem Renaissance. Born in Jacksonville, Florida, he had much of his career in New York City. Johnson is noted as the composer of the hymn \\"Lift Every Voice and Sing‚Äù. It was first performed live by 500 Black American students from the segregated Stanton School (elementary/middle/junior high- level), Jacksonville, Florida, in 1900.Audio recording, Atlanta Music Festival. The song was published by Joseph W. Stern & Co., Manhattan, New York (later the Edward B. Marks Music Company).Edward B. Marks Music Company. J. Rosamond Johnson was the younger brother of poet and activist James Weldon Johnson, who wrote the lyrics for \\"Lift Every Voice and Sing\\". The two also worked together in causes related to the NAACP. Biography J. Rosamond Johnson was born on August 11, 1873, the son of Helen Louise Dillet, a native of Nassau, Bahamas, and James Johnson. His maternal great-grandmother, Hester Argo, had escaped from Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) during the revolutionary upheaval in 1802, along with her three young children, including (Johnson's grandfather Stephen Dillet (1797‚Äì1880). Although originally headed to Cuba, their boat was intercepted by privateers and they were brought to Nassau, Bahamas instead. There they permanently settled. In 1833 Stephen Dillet was the first man of color to win election to the Bahamian legislature. Along This Way, James Weldon Johnson's autobiography. Johnson was trained at the New England Conservatory and then studied in London. His career began as a public school teacher in his hometown of Jacksonville, Florida. Traveling to New York, he began his show business career along with his brother and composer Bob Cole. As a songwriting team, they wrote works such as The Evolution of Ragtime (1903). Among the earliest works by the group was a suite of six songs of \\"Negro\\" music. The men also produced two successful Broadway operettas with casts of black actors: Shoo-Fly Regiment of 1906 and The Red Moon of 1908.... Johnson also performed in these operettas. He played a Tuskegee soldier who enlists in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in The Shoo Fly Regiment and portrayed African-American Plunk Green opposite Abbie Mitchell‚Äôs Minnehaha, a mixed Indian/black woman, in The Red Moon. These performances went beyond theatre. Rosamond, alongside his brother and Cole, evoked a political presence in their inclusion of other races in their musicals. In The Red Moon, Cole and Johnson broke racial lines as they included a love scene between Rosamond‚Äôs Green and Mitchell‚Äôs Minnehaha. This spotlight on Native Americans was so well received that Rosamond was inducted as a ‚Äòsub-chief‚Äô into the Iroquois tribe of Montreal‚Äôs Caughnawaga Reservation, which had a majority population of ethnic Mohawk people. Cole and the Johnson brothers also created and produced several \\"white\\" musicals: Sleeping Beauty and the Beast in 1901, In Newport in 1904, and Humpty Dumpty in 1904. Johnson would also collaborate to create Hello Paris with J. Leubrie Hill in 1911. Johnson was active in various musical roles during his career. He toured the vaudeville circuit and, after Cole's 1911 death, began a successful tour with Charles Hart and Tom Brown. In London, he wrote music for a theater review from 1912 to 1913 serving a long residency. After returning to the United States, New York's Music School Settlement for Colored -- founded by the New York Symphony Orchestra's David Mannes -- appointed him as director where he served from 1914 to 1919. J. Rosamond Johson served as the first Deputy Marshal for the historic Negro Silent Protest Parade in 1917. Johnson also toured with his own ensembles, The Harlem Rounders and The Inimitable Five. He also performed in Negro spiritual concerts with Emmanuel Taylor Gordon, including at Aeolian Hall in Manhattan. The London production of Lew Leslie's Blackbirds of 1936 engaged Johnson as musical director. During the 1930s, Johnson also sang the role of Frazier in the original production of Gershwin's Porgy and Bess, taking roles in other dramas as well. He reprised his role as Frazier on the 1951 studio recording of Porgy and Bess. As an editor, he collected four important works of traditional African-American songs. The first two of these song collections he compiled along with his brother James: The Book of American Negro Spirituals (1925) and The Second Book of Negro Spirituals (1926). In addition, Johnson edited Shoutsongs (1936) and the folksong anthology Rolling Along in Song (1937). J. Rosamond Johnson with his brother, James Weldon Johnson.

The last advance covered most of northern North America between c. 95,000 and c. 20,000 years before the present day and, among other geomorphological effects, gouged out the five Great Lakes and the hosts of smaller lakes of the Canadian Shield. These lakes extend from the eastern Northwest Territories, through most of northern Canada, and the upper Midwestern United States (Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan) to the Finger Lakes, through Lake Champlain and Lake George areas of New York, across the northern Appalachians into and through all of New England and Nova Scotia. At times, the ice sheet's southern margin included the present-day sites of coastal towns of the Northeastern United States, and cities such as Boston and New York City and Great Lakes coastal cities and towns as far south as Chicago and St. Louis, Missouri, and then followed the present course of the Missouri River up to the northern slopes of the Cypress Hills, beyond which it merged with the Cordilleran Ice Sheet. The ice coverage extended approximately as far south as 38 degrees latitude mid-continent. Description This ice sheet was the primary feature of the Pleistocene epoch in North America, commonly referred to as the ice age. It was up to thick in Nunavik, Quebec, Canada, but much thinner at its edges, where nunataks were common in hilly areas. It created much of the surface geology of southern Canada and the northern United States, leaving behind glacially scoured valleys, moraines, eskers and glacial till. It also caused many changes to the shape, size, and drainage of the Great Lakes. As but one of many examples, near the end of the last ice age, Lake Iroquois extended well beyond the boundaries of present-day Lake Ontario, and drained down the Hudson River into the Atlantic Ocean.Flint, R.F. 1971. Glacial and Quaternary Geology. Wiley and Sons, NY. 892 p. Its cycles of growth and melting were a decisive influence on global climate during its existence. This is because it served to divert the jet stream southward, which would otherwise flow from the relatively warm Pacific Ocean through Montana and Minnesota. That gave the Southwestern United States, otherwise a desert, abundant rainfall during ice ages, in extreme contrast to most other parts of the world which became exceedingly dry, though the effect of ice sheets in Europe had an analogous effect on the rainfall in Afghanistan, parts of Iran, possibly western Pakistan in winter, as well as North Africa. The Barnes Ice Cap, containing remnants of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Its melting also caused major disruptions to the global climate cycle, because the huge influx of low- salinity water into the Arctic Ocean via the Mackenzie River is believed to have disrupted the formation of North Atlantic Deep Water, the very saline, cold, deep water that flows from the Greenland Sea. That interrupted the thermohaline circulation, creating the brief Younger Dryas cold epoch and a temporary re-advance of the ice sheet, which did not retreat from Nunavik until 6,500 years ago. During the Pre-Illinoian Stage, the Laurentide Ice Sheet extended as far south as the Missouri and Ohio River valleys. The ultimate collapse of the Laurentide Ice Sheet is also suspected to have influenced European agriculture indirectly through the rise of global sea levels. Canada's oldest ice is a 20,000-year-old remnant of the Laurentide Ice Sheet called the Barnes Ice Cap, on central Baffin Island. Ice centers During the Late Pleistocene, the Laurentide ice sheet reached from the Rocky Mountains eastward through the Great Lakes, into New England, covering nearly all of Canada east of the Rocky Mountains.Geologic Framework and Glaciation of the Central Area, 1-1-2006; Christopher L. Hill; Boise State University, Boise, Idaho; 2006 Three major ice centers formed in North America: the Labrador, Keewatin, and Cordilleran. The Cordilleran covered the region from the Pacific Ocean to the eastern front of the Rocky Mountains and the Labrador and Keewatin fields are referred to as the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Central North America has evidence of the numerous lobes and sublobes. The Keewatin covered the western interior plains of North America from the Mackenzie River to the Missouri River and the upper reaches of the Mississippi River. The Labrador covered spread over eastern Canada and the northeastern part of the United States abutting the Keewatin lobe in the western Great Lakes and Mississippi valley.  Cordilleran ice flow Cordilleran Ice Sheet covered up to at the Last Glacial Maximum. The eastern edge abutted the Laurentide ice sheet. The sheet was anchored in the Coast Mountains of British Columbia and Alberta, south into the Cascade Range of Washington. That is one and a half times the water held in the Antarctic. Anchored in the mountain backbone of the west coast, the ice sheet dissipated north of the Alaska Range where the air was too dry to form glaciers. It is believed that the Cordilleran ice melted rapidly, in less than 4000 years. The water created numerous Proglacial lakes along the margins such as Lake Missoula, often leading to catastrophic floods as with the Missoula Floods. Much of the topography of Eastern Washington and northern Montana and North Dakota was affected.  Keewatin ice flow  The Keewatin ice sheet has had four or five primary lobes identified ice divides extending from a dome over west-central Keewatin. Two of the lobes abut the adjacent Labrador and Baffin ice sheets. The primary lobes flow (1) towards Manitoba and Saskatchewan; (2) toward Hudson Bay; (3) towards the Gulf of Boothia, and (4) towards the Beaufort Sea.Late Wisconsinan and Holocene History of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, 10.7202/032681ar; Arthur S. Dyke, Victor K. Prest; Geological Survey of Canada; Ottawa, Ontario; 1987; http://id.erudit.org/iderudit/032681ar  Labrador ice flow  The Labrador ice sheet flowed across all of Maine and into the Gulf of St. Lawrence, completely covering the Maritime Provinces. The Appalachian Ice Complex, flowed from the Gasp√© Peninsula over New Brunswick, the Magdalen Shelf, and Nova Scotia. The Labrador flow extended across the mouth of the St. Lawrence River, reaching the Gasp√© Peninsula and across Chaleur Bay. From the Escuminac center on the Magdalen Shelf, flowed onto the Acadian Peninsula of New Brunswick and southeastward, onto the Gaspe, burying the western end of Prince Edward Island and reached the head of Bay of Fundy. From the Gaspereau center, on the divide crossing New Brunswick flowed into the Bay of Fundy and Chaleur Bay. In New York, the ice that covered Manhattan was about 2,000 feet high before it began to melt in about 16,000 BC. The ice in the area disappeared around 10,000 BC. The ground in the New York area has since risen by more than 150 ft because of the removal of the enormous weight of the melted ice. Baffin ice flow  The Baffin ice sheet was circular and centered over the Foxe Basin. A major divide across the basin, created a westward flow across the Melville Peninsula, from an eastward flow over Baffin Island and Southampton Island. Across southern Baffin Island, two divides created four additional lobes. The Penny Ice Divide split the Cumberland Peninsula, where Pangnirtung created flow toward Home Bay on the north and Cumberland Sound on the south. The Amadjuak Ice Divide on the Hall Peninsula, where Iqaluit sits created a north flow into Cumberland Sound and a south flow into the Hudson Strait. A secondary Hall Ice Divide formed a link to a local ice cap on the Hall Peninsula. The current ice caps on Baffin Island are thought to be a remnant from this time period, but it was not a part of the Baffin ice flow, but an autonomous flow.

He was present at the battles of Valmy and Jemappes, and in 1793 obtained a company, as promotion was rapid in those days. In all the subsequent campaigns (including the First Battle of Zurich) he was actively employed under Dumouriez, Pichegru, Moreau, Mass√©na, and others. Early Empire In 1803, he was colonel of the 5th regiment of horse artillery, and refused, from political principles, the appointment of aide-de-camp on Napoleon's assumption of the imperial throne. Nevertheless, he was employed in Auguste Marmont's II Corps and shared in the victories of Napoleon's brilliant 1805 Ulm Campaign in Germany. In 1806, he commanded the artillery of the army stationed in Friuli, for the purpose of occupying the Venetian territory incorporated by the treaty of Pressburg with the kingdom of Italy. In 1807, he was sent to Constantinople to introduce European tactics in the Turkish service, but this object was defeated by the death of Selim III and the opposition of the Janissaries. Service in Portugal On Foy's return, the expedition against Portugal was preparing. He received a command in the artillery under Maj-Gen Jean-Andoche Junot in the first French invasion of Portugal. During the occupation of Portugal, he filled the post of inspector of forts and fortresses. He was severely wounded at the Battle of Vimeiro. After the Convention of Cintra, he returned to France, and with the same army proceeded to Spain. In November 1808, he was promoted to general of brigade and fought under the command of Marshal Nicolas Soult at the Battle of Corunna. In early 1809, he led a brigade under Soult in the second French invasion of Portugal. When commanded to summon the Bishop of Porto to open the gates of Porto, he was seized, stripped by the populace and thrown into prison. He escaped with difficulty. At the Second Battle of Porto, he alertly spotted Arthur Wellesley's surprise river crossing. Leading the 17th Light Infantry in a futile attempt to drive the British back, Foy was wounded. Foy was wounded again while leading his brigade at the Battle of Bussaco during the third French invasion of Portugal. In 1810, he made a skilful retreat at the head of 600 men, in the face of 6,000 Spaniards, across the Sierra de Caceres. Early in 1811, he was selected by Marshal Andr√© Mass√©na to convey to the emperor the critical state of the French army before the Lines of Torres Vedras. This commission, though one of great peril ‚Äî the country being in a complete state of insurrection ‚Äî he successfully accomplished, for which service he was made general of division. Service in Spain In July 1812, Foy was in the Battle of Salamanca and covered the retreat of the defeated French army. He was one of those who, when Wellington raised the siege of Burgos and retreated to the Douro, hung upon his rear and took some prisoners and artillery. On the news of the disasters in Russia and Wellington's consequent resumption of offensive movements, Foy was sent with his division beyond Vittoria to keep the different parties in check. After the battle of Vittoria, at which he was not present, he collected 20,000 troops of different divisions at Bergana, and had some success in skirmishes with the Spanish corps forming the left wing of the allied army. He arrived at Tolosa about the same time as Lieut-Gen Thomas Graham. After a sanguinary contest in that town, retreated upon Irun, from which he was quickly dislodged, and finally recrossed the Bidassoa River. Foy commanded a division in Marshal Soult's army during the Battle of the Pyrenees in July 1813. After Soult's defeat at Sorauren, Foy saved his division and parts of other commands by retreating northeast over the Roncesvalles Pass. Final career In the Battle of the Nive on 9 December 1813 and the Battle of St. Pierre d'Irrube on the 13th, Foy distinguished himself. In the hard fought Battle of Orthez, on 27 February 1814, he was left apparently dead on the field. Before this period he had been made count of the empire, and Commander of the L√©gion d'honneur. In March 1815, he was appointed inspector general of the fourteenth military division, but on the return of Napoleon, during the Hundred Days, he embraced the cause of the emperor. Foy commanded a division of infantry in the battles of Quatre Bras and Waterloo, at the last of which he received his fifteenth wound. This terminated his military career. In 1819, he was elected a member of the Chamber of Deputies, the duties of which he discharged until his death in November 1825; and from his first entrance into the chamber, was distinguished for his eloquence, and quickly became the acknowledged leader of the opposition. Before his death he wrote a history of the Peninsular War.  Notes  References  * Chandler, David, Dictionary of the Napoleonic Wars. Macmillan, 1979. * Glover, Michael, The Peninsular War 1808-1814.

Properties Hubble Space Telescope image of the center of NGC 1275 NGC 1275 consists of two galaxies, a central type-cD galaxy in the Perseus Cluster, and a so-called \\"high velocity system\\" (HVS) which lies in front of it.

The amount of gas contained in a typical thread is approximately one million times the mass of the Sun. They are only 200 light-years wide, are often very straight, and extend for up to 20,000 light-years.Hubble Sees Magnetic Monster in Erupting Galaxy Newswise, Retrieved on August 21, 2008. The existence of the filaments poses a problem. As they are much cooler than the surrounding intergalactic cloud, it is unclear how they have existed for such a long time, or why they have not warmed, dissipated or collapsed to form stars. One possibility is that weak magnetic fields (about one-ten-thousandth the strength of Earth's field) exert enough force on the ions within the threads to keep them together. NGC 1275 contains 13 billion solar masses of molecular hydrogen that seems to be infalling from Perseus' intracluster medium in a cooling flow, both feeding its active nucleus and fueling significant amounts of star formation The presence of an active nucleus demonstrates that a supermassive black hole is present in NGC 1275's center. The black hole is surrounded by a rotating disk of molecular gas. High-resolution observations of the rotation of this disk obtained using adaptive optics at the Gemini North telescope indicate a central mass of approximately 800 million Solar masses, including both the mass of the black hole and of the inner core of the gas disk.

It set the stage for Brandy Station and other cavalry actions of the Gettysburg Campaign that summer. Twenty-one hundred troopers of Brig. Gen. William W. Averell's Union cavalry division crossed the Rappahannock to attack the Confederate cavalry that had been harassing them that winter. Brig. Gen. Fitzhugh Lee counterattacked with a brigade of about 800 men. After achieving a localized success, Union forces withdrew under pressure in late afternoon, without destroying Lee's cavalry. Background When Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside was relieved of command of the Union's Army of the Potomac (following the disastrous Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862 and the fiasco of his Mud March in January 1863), his replacement, Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, immediately began reorganizing and training his army, in winter quarters outside of Fredericksburg. One of his most significant actions was to combine smaller cavalry units, spread out across the army, into a single Cavalry Corps, led by Maj. Gen. George Stoneman. Up until this time, the Union cavalry had been consistently outperformed by their Confederate counterparts, commanded by Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart. Although they possessed superior equipment and had the advantage of a plentiful supply of men and federal horses, the Union cavalrymen had lacked the confidence, experience, and leadership to challenge Stuart.Salmon, pp. 165-67. On February 25, 1863, Confederate cavalry under Brig. Gen. Fitzhugh Lee, one of Stuart's key subordinates and a nephew of Gen. Robert E. Lee, led a force of 400 troopers in a raid near Hartwood Church in Stafford County, 9 miles northwest of Fredericksburg. The federal cavalry was ineffective in pursuing Lee and managed to lose 150 prisoners from the division of Brig. Gen. William W. Averell, one of Fitz Lee's closest friends at West Point. Hooker was furious and threatened to relieve Stoneman of his command if he did not stop Confederate raids of this type. At the same time, Fitzhugh Lee was sending his old friend and classmate taunting messages across the river. One of the more challenging messages said \\"I wish you would put up your sword, leave my state, and go home. You ride a good horse, I ride a better. If you won't go home, return my visit, and bring me a sack of coffee.\\".Fitzhugh Lee, Brandy Station Foundation Scouts from Averell's 2nd Division, Cavalry Corps, detected Confederate cavalry near Culpeper Court House about three weeks later. Averell assembled a force of 3,000 cavalrymen and six artillery pieces (the 6th Battery, New York Light Artillery, under Captain Joseph W. Martin) and set off for Kelly's Ford on the Rappahannock River between Fauquier and Culpeper Counties. After various troops were detached to cover his movements and to engage the enemy's pickets at Rappahannock Station, he had 2,100 men ready for battle in three brigades, commanded by Col. Alfred N. Duffi√©, Col. John B. McIntosh, and Capt. Marcus Reno. Facing him was a detached Confederate brigade commanded by Fitzhugh Lee, 800 men in five regiments, with a two-gun artillery section.Blumberg, pp. 1111-12; Eicher, p. 451. The \\"Maryland Scroll,\\" a graffiti on the wall of the \\"Graffiti House,\\" in Brandy Station, Virginia, contains the names of 16 Maryland Confederates who served rifled gun #1 of James Breathed's Battery and were on picket duty in Brandy Station on March 16, 1863. The unfurling banner (also known as the horizontal scroll) reads: \\"Rifle Gun\\" and \\"No. 1, Stuart Horse Artillery / Breathed's Battery / On Picket - March 16, 1863.\\" Brandy Station Foundation, Maryland ScrollBreathed's Battery is usually shown in orders of battle as a Virginia unit.

Battle Map of Kelly's Ford Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. Early on the morning of March 17, 1863, Averell's advance guard reached Kelly's Ford on the Rappahannock and found that felled trees and 60 Confederate sharpshooters opposed their crossing. Three attempts to cross were repulsed under heavy fire, delaying the Union advance by over 90 minutes. Averell's chief of staff, Major Samuel E. Chamberlain, eventually forced a crossing led by 20 men of the 1st Rhode Island Cavalry. Chamberlain was wounded in the head. Despite the minor casualties in this action, Averell proceeded cautiously, taking over two hours to cross his men over the swiftly running river.Eicher, pp. 450-52. Lee, 10 miles west at Culpeper Court House, was notified of the crossing attempts by 7:30 a.m. Assuming that Averell's target was Brandy Station on the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, Lee sent his 800 men forward to block the Union advance. They encountered the Union cavalrymen deployed near the C.T. Wheatley house, about 2 miles northwest of Kelly's Ford. Duffi√©'s brigade was positioned on the left in a woodlot, McIntosh's in the center, and Reno's two regiments of regulars on the right, behind a stone fence. Jeb Stuart also happened to be at Culpeper Court House that day, attending a court-martial. He decided to ride out to witness the battle, taking with him his artillery chief, Maj. John Pelham. They arrived to find that Lee's men were not doing well, outnumbered two to one and facing a well-positioned artillery battery. It was the first time in the war that a Confederate cavalry regiment (the 2nd Virginia) had fled in the face of a Union charge. Lee's men advanced with the five regiments in line abreast. The 3rd and 5th Virginia Cavalry regiments, led by sharpshooters, ran along the stone fence with the expectation they would find a gap in it somewhere. Pelham moved forward with Lee's men, and as he waved them through a gate in the fence, a shell exploded over his head, sending a tiny fragment into his brain, mortally wounding him. He died a few hours later. The Confederate advance was repulsed by carbine fire from the 16th Pennsylvania Cavalry and shelling from Martin's battery. On the Union left, Duffi√© disobeyed Averell's orders to hold his position and ordered a charge. The surprise attack forced Lee to withdraw his men back through the woods to a clearing just behind. Lee counterattacked the advancing Union troopers, but once again had to fall back in the face of superior numbers and artillery. A rout of the Confederate position might have been possible, but Reno did not advance in support of Duffi√©, maintaining his position as ordered earlier by Averell. Aftermath An illustration of the battle from the 1863 Harpers By 5:30 p.m., Averell, citing his exhausted men and horses, \\"deemed it proper to withdraw.\\" He left two Confederate officers who had been wounded and captured by Averell's troops, a sack of coffee, and the following message: \\"Dear Fitz, Here's your coffee. Here's your visit. How do you like it?\\"William Averell, Brandy Station Foundation Some of his fellow officers believed that he lost his nerve, concerned about the presence of Jeb Stuart on the battlefield and, hearing the sound of railroad cars approaching, imagining the possibility of a Confederate infantry force pinning him against the river. The Union advance had covered 2 miles over more than 12 hours and resulted in 78 casualties (6 killed, 50 wounded, 22 missing). The Confederates lost 133 (11 dead, 88 wounded, 34 captured); 71 Confederate horses were killed and 12 were captured. The loss of the youthful Pelham, age 24, well respected by Robert E. Lee, Stuart, and many veterans of the Battle of Fredericksburg, was a shock. Stuart wrote after the battle, \\"The gallant Pelham--so noble, so true--will be mourned by the nation.\\"Blumberg, p. 1112; Eicher, p. 452. The battle was technically a Confederate victory because Averell's men failed to achieve their objective of destroying Lee's smaller force and they withdrew under pressure across the ford at dusk. However the Federal cavalrymen believed they had won a moral victory because, for the first time, they had held their own against Stuart's legendary horsemen. They would proceed into the 1863 summer campaigns with increased confidence. One of the participants, Lt. Joseph A. Chedell of the 1st Rhode Island, wrote that Kelly's Ford was the \\"first real, and perhaps the most brilliant, cavalry fight of the whole war.\\"Denison, p. 213. Both Union and Confederate armies used Kelly's Ford extensively during the Civil War. In addition to the role it played in this battle, it was also host to two notable engagements that occurred later that same year: the Battle of Brandy Station on June 9, 1863, and one during the Bristoe Campaign's Second Battle of Rappahannock Station on November 7, 1863.

His music mixes modern pop with Spanish music. Biography David Broza was born in Haifa, Israel. His father was an Israeli‚ÄìBritish businessman. He grew up in England and Spain, attending Runnymede College, in Madrid. Broza's grandfather, Wellesley Aron, co-founded the Arab-Israeli peace settlement Neve Shalom ‚Äì WƒÅƒßat as-SalƒÅm (The Oasis of Peace), Jewish Music Group (archived webpage) and the Habonim youth movement. Young David Broza originally planned to become a graphic artist, and by age 17 he was selling his paintings in the Rastro, Madrid's Sunday flea market. Following high school, and while serving in the Israel Defense Forces, he began playing guitar in cafes to earn extra money. Eventually he was offered a record deal, but as he still hoped to attend the Rhode Island School of Design, he declined. He later recorded a tape to promote his live shows. Broza was married to Ruti, from whom he is divorced. He has three children. He lived in Cresskill, New Jersey, United States for 17 years.Leichman, Joseph. \\"A Chava Alberstein and David Broza experience: Israeli Megastars head for Englewood\\", Jewish Standard, March 1, 2007.

Since 1977, when his hit song ‚ÄúYihye Tov‚Äù first hit the airwaves, David Broza has been working to promote a message of peace. In 2013, Broza began work on a new project ‚Äì bringing together Israeli and Palestinian musicians for 8 days and nights to work side by side in an East Jerusalem recording studio. The result was East Jerusalem West Jerusalem, a collection of thirteen songs that blends cultures, languages and styles into a powerful statement about collaboration and coexistence. The album, produced by Steve Earle, features a stirring duet with Wyclef Jean. In 2007, a concert at Masada featured Broza with special guests Jackson Browne and Shawn Colvin. David Broza has appeared as a guest and shared the bill with Paul Simon, Bob Dylan, Van Morrison and many more. Musical collaboration In 1994, David Broza performed with Texan singer- songwriter Townes Van Zandt during a Writers in the Round concert in Houston. They never met or had any further contact thereafter, and yet, when Van Zandt died three years later, he left Broza a shoe box full of unreleased poems and lyrics with a request that Broza set them to music. Years later, the result of that unusual story was the album \\"Night Dawn: The Unpublished Poetry of Townes Van Zandt\\", which was released by Broza in 2010.Townes Van Zandt's bequest finds new life at \\"Dawn\\" Reuters article of February 13, 2010 (which includes an interview with Broza, telling the story's twists and turns from his point of view), retrieved July 15, 2018see the Night Dawn video trailer in David Broza's official YouTube channel (which, inter alia, includes rare snippets from the 1994 concert in which Van Zandt and Broza participated) In 2007, David Broza performed at his annual Sunrise at Masada concert in Israel where Broza collaborated with Shawn Colvin and Jackson Browne. The concert was filmed as part of a PBS special and was released in 2014 on DVD and CD by Magenta Label Group. In early 2013, Broza recorded sessions at Sabreen Studios in East Jerusalem with a band composed of both Israeli and Palestinian musicians, including Mira Awad, Shaa'nan Streett of Hadag Nahash, West Bank rap duo G-Town and Wyclef Jean. The resulting album, \\"East Jerusalem/West Jerusalem,\\" produced by Steve Earle and Steve Greenberg, was released in early 2014 on S-Curve Records. Peace activism Broza was appointed a goodwill ambassador for UNICEF. His song \\"Together\\" (co-written with Ramsey McLean) was the theme song for the UNICEF 50th anniversary celebration in more than 148 countries.

It employs circa 10,000 personnel nationwide, working across 850+ estate agency or lettings offices operating under 65+ local high street brands, supplemented by 650 mortgage consultants. Countrywide is listed on the London Stock Exchange. History In 1986, financial services company Hambros plc, having de-merged its banking arm, acquired two estate agents, Bairstow Eves and Mann & Co, to form a new company called Hambro Countrywide plc, which was listed on the London Stock Exchange. In 1988, the company created Hambro Assured, then the UK's largest life insurance broker. The group then grew through acquisition, buying Nationwide estate agents and surveyors from Nationwide Building Society in 1994, Spencers from National and Provincial Building Society in 1995 and London firms Faron Sutaria, PKL and John D Wood & Co. in 1997. In 1998 the business was renamed Countrywide Assured plc and demerged from Hambros plc. After creating a franchise opportunity under the Bairstow Eves brand, the group then restarted its acquisition trail acquiring Friends Provident estate agents and surveyors (in return for a long term licence to resell Friends Provident financial products) in August 2002. Friends Provident Estate Agencies operated 104 offices across the South of England, trading as: Fulfords, Chappell & Matthews, Palmer Snell and Carson & Company and had been acquired by Friends Provident as an 80-strong chain in 1998 as part of their takeover of London and Manchester Group plc.Cicutti, Nic. \\"Friends set for pounds 750m L&M; takeover\\".

It is the sixth largest city in the country, with a population of 15,404 as of March 2014. Originally a part of ≈ªejtun, ≈ªabbar was granted the title of Citt√† Hompesch by the last of the Grand Masters of the Order of St. John to reign in Malta, Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim. Etymology The name of the city probably derives from the Maltese word ti≈ºbor, the process of pruning trees. Indeed, a number of families who specialised in pruning, ≈ºbir, are known to have lived in the vicinity of this village during the Middle Ages. Other possibilities of this derivation exist. ≈ªabbar was also the surname of an important family that was known to have lived in the area. ƒ¶a≈º-≈ªabbar could also have been a corruption of ƒ¶as-Sabbar (the consoler village), because people from all over the island used to visit the village to pray to Our Lady of Graces for consolation. The word sabbar could also be the plural of sabbara (the Aloe vera plant) in Maltese. This would be derived from the Arabic ÿµŸéÿ®Ÿëÿßÿ± (·π£abbƒÅr) meaning cacti. In fact, in some Arab countries ·π£abbƒÅr means prickly pear. The \\"·π£\\" in this case, is strong and is pronounced as \\"z\\". Judging by the names of other Maltese villages, like nearby ≈ªejtun (meaning \\"olive\\" in Arabic) it seems quite probable that such names may have agricultural connotations. Demography ƒ¶a≈º-≈ªabbar is bound to the north by Kalkara and Xgƒßajra, to the west by Fgura and the Cottonera Lines (enclosing the localities of Vittoriosa and Cospicua), to the east by Marsaskala and to the south by ≈ªejtun. ƒ¶a≈º-≈ªabbar has the largest population of all localities within the area. The western part of this town, composed essentially of Il-Biccieni and Tal-Bajjada (also known as Il-Misrah) areas, is characterized by high dwelling density and comprises a series of winding streets that define the village core. The eastern half is mostly suburban with more recent developments mostly in the form of terraced housing and modern maisonettes and apartments. ƒ¶a≈º-≈ªabbar has two other distinct residential neighbourhoods namely Bulebel iz-Zghir, which is characterized by Government housing estates/ multi-storey apartment blocks and rows of terraced house units that were constructed out of various Home Ownership Schemes (HOS), and the area referred to as St. Peter's.

The town was used as an encampment by the Ottoman armies at the outset of the Great Siege of 1565. ƒ¶a≈º-≈ªabbar was granted city status by the last Grand Master on Malta, Ferdinand von Hompesch, in whose name the population built a triumphal arch on the main approach road from Paola through Fgura. During the Maltese uprising against the French between 1798 and 1800 the city was used as a base by the Maltese insurgents. A memorable battle on 5th October 1798 took place in front of the ƒ¶a≈º-≈ªabbar Sanctuary. To this day, French-era cannonballs are to be seen in a household wall in the city's older parts and some are also in the church museum after being retrieved from the old church dome.Bonavia, C.G. (2016, August 28). ≈ªabbar's constant development as a parish. The Sunday Times of Malta, pp. 32-33 British Era World War II monument in ≈ªabbar During the British era a number of forts and batteries were built in the area. These were Fort Saint Rocco, Fort Saint Leonardo, Delle Grazie Battery and ≈ªonqor Battery. Fort Saint Rocco was built between 1873 and 1875. It was later expanded and 3 cannons were fitted. Also, Fort Saint Leonardo was fitted with 4 cannons. These two forts took care of the neighboring seas. The two batteries also took care of the area altogether with the Rinella battery which contains the 100 ton Armstrong Gun. 1951 A memorable date for the ≈ªabbarin. The then Metropolitan Archbishop of Malta Michael Gonzi crowned the miraculous image of Our Lady of Grace venerated in her Sanctuary. A large crowd gathered in front of the Sanctuary on Sunday 2 September 1951. During 2001 a twelve star silver diadem was placed on it by Archbishop Joseph Mercieca, in celebration of the Golden Jubilee. Recent history More recently, on 14 October 1975, Vulcan B. 2, XM645 of No.9 Squadron RAF, exploded over the village with many parts of it falling on the school and one wing full of fuel on Sanctuary Street, the main street of the village. The children were having their break at that time and were safely evacuated by the supervising teachers and headmaster. The whole accident, which involved other parts of the city, due to the violent explosion, claimed six victims. Five of them were crew members trapped in the plane. The sixth was a civilian, who was hit by an electricity cable torn down by the falling wing. Various items (including the aircraft undercarriage) can be seen at the ≈ªabbar Sanctuary Museum. Culture The city is very devout, particularly to Our Lady of Grace, to whom the city Sanctuary is dedicated. A vast number of paintings and other artefacts can be found in the Sanctuary Museum, most of which have 'VFGA' in some way or other imprinted on them. This is the Latin abbreviation for Votum Fecit, Gratiam Accipit, meaning that a grace has been asked for and it had been granted due to intercession by the Madonna tal- Grazzja (Our Lady of Grace). The paintings are about marine subjects and give large detail about ships of the Knights of Malta era. The Mattia Preti painting is found in the town's museum. The Sanctuary The building of the Church of Our Lady of Graces was started in 1641 at the instigation of the Parish Priest Don Francesco Piscopo and was completed around 1718 according to the commemoration plaque of the Consecration by Bishop Vincenzo Labini in 1784. A Maltese proverb says \\"a church is never finished\\", which is another way of stating that the people in a particular parish are never satisfied with their own church and, depending on their means, are forever the ambition that the church in one's village be better and bigger than the church in the next parish. The good people of ƒ¶a≈º-≈ªabbar are no exception. Largely from the private funds of the Parish Priest Andrea Buhagiar, in addition to money collected from the people of ƒ¶a≈º-≈ªabbar, work on embellishing the church was started in 1738. The Maltese architect Giovanni Bonavia redesigned the fa√ßade and two belltowers were erected; in addition the church was paved in marble and provided with a crypt. The main painting of the Madonna and Child is a work by the painter Alessio Erardi. Feasts ƒ¶a≈º-≈ªabbar hosts a village feast on the first Sunday after 8 September, which features a motorcycle and bicycle pilgrimage each starting from Mosta and Rabat respectively. This is done because Our Lady of Grace is the patron of cyclists. Strong competition exists between the village's two band clubs, locally known as the Societ√† Filarmonica Maria Mater Grati√¶ (sporting blue and known as Tal-Baqra) and the Gƒßaqda Madonna Tal-Grazzja Banda San Mikiel (sporting green and known as Tal- Bajda). Another feast celebrated in ƒ¶a≈º-≈ªabbar includes St. Michael the Archangel on the third Sunday after 8 September. This feast includes a solemn mass at the Zabbar Sanctuary. During the evening a brass band march is held in the town centre. The band accompanies the statue of St. Michael the Archangel. The most sensational moment during this march is when the statue of St. Michael the Archangel passes in front of the monumental statue of Our Lady of Graces, the patron of ≈ªabbar. A procession of Our Lady of the Rosary is also held on 7 October. ƒ¶add in-Nies or People's Sunday is celebrated on the first Sunday of Lent. An afternoon pilgrimage accompanied by the titular statue, having a different starting point each year, is led by the Archbishop of Malta and ends at the Our Lady of Grace Sanctuary where a pontifical mass is celebrated. Among the celebrations for this feast one can mention the Classical Music Concerts held by the two local band clubs in the Notre Dame Hall.

Attempts to create such a model established the more general field of celestial mechanics. The results of this simulation can be compared with past measurements to check for accuracy and then be used to predict future positions. Its main use therefore is in preparation of almanacs. Older efforts The simulations can be done in either Cartesian or in spherical coordinates. The former are easier, but extremely calculation intensive, and only practical on an electronic computer. As such only the latter was used in former times. Strictly speaking, the latter was not much less calculation intensive, but it was possible to start with some simple approximations and then to add perturbations, as much as needed to reach the wanted accuracy. In essence this mathematical simulation of the Solar System is a form of the N-body problem. The symbol N represents the number of bodies, which can grow quite large if one includes the Sun, 8 planets, dozens of moons, and countless planetoids, comets and so forth. However the influence of the Sun on any other body is so large, and the influence of all the other bodies on each other so small, that the problem can be reduced to the analytically solvable 2-body problem. The result for each planet is an orbit, a simple description of its position as function of time. Once this is solved the influences moons and planets have on each other are added as small corrections. These are small compared to a full planetary orbit. Some corrections might be still several degrees large, while measurements can be made to an accuracy of better than 1‚Ä≥. Although this method is no longer used for simulations, it is still useful to find an approximate ephemeris as one can take the relatively simple main solution, perhaps add a few of the largest perturbations, and arrive without too much effort at the wanted planetary position. The disadvantage is that perturbation theory is very advanced mathematics. Modern method The modern method consists of numerical integration in 3-dimensional space. One starts with a high accuracy value for the position (x, y, z) and the velocity (vx, vy, vz) for each of the bodies involved. When also the mass of each body is known, the acceleration (ax, ay, az) can be calculated from Newton's Law of Gravitation. Each body attracts each other body, the total acceleration being the sum of all these attractions. Next one chooses a small time-step Œît and applies Newton's Second Law of Motion. The acceleration multiplied with Œît gives a correction to the velocity. The velocity multiplied with Œît gives a correction to the position. This procedure is repeated for all other bodies. The result is a new value for position and velocity for all bodies. Then, using these new values one starts over the whole calculation for the next time-step Œît. Repeating this procedure often enough, and one ends up with a description of the positions of all bodies over time. The advantage of this method is that for a computer it is a very easy job to do, and it yields highly accurate results for all bodies at the same time, doing away with the complex and difficult procedures for determining perturbations. The disadvantage is that one must start with highly accurate figures in the first place, or the results will drift away from the reality in time; that one gets x, y, z positions which are often first to be transformed into more practical ecliptical or equatorial coordinates before they can be used; and that it is an all or nothing approach. If one wants to know the position of one planet on one particular time, then all other planets and all intermediate time-steps are to be calculated too. Integration In the previous section it was assumed that acceleration remains constant over a small timestep Œît so that the calculation reduces to simply the addition of V √ó Œît to R and so forth. In reality this is not the case, except when one takes Œît so small that the number of steps to be taken would be prohibitively high. Because while at any time the position is changed by the acceleration, the value of the acceleration is determined by the instantaneous position. Evidently a full integration is needed. Several methods are available. First notice the needed equations: \\\\vec{a}_j = \\\\sum_{i eq j}^n G \\\\frac{M_i}{\\\\vec{r}_i - \\\\vec{r}_j^3} (\\\\vec{r}_i - \\\\vec{r}_j) This equation describes the acceleration all bodies i running from 1 to N exercise on a particular body j. It is a vector equation, so it is to be split in 3 equations for each of the X, Y, Z components, yielding: (a_j)_x = \\\\sum_{i eq j}^n G \\\\frac{M_i}{( (x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2 + (z_i - z_j)^2 )^{3/2}} (x_i - x_j) with the additional relationships a_{x} = \\\\frac{dv_{x}}{dt}, v_{x} = \\\\frac{dx}{dt} likewise for Y and Z. The former equation (gravitation) may look foreboding, but its calculation is no problem. The latter equations (motion laws) seems simpler, but yet it cannot be calculated. Computers cannot integrate, they cannot work with infinitesimal values, so instead of dt we use Œît and bringing the resulting variable to the left: \\\\Delta v_x = a_{x} \\\\Delta t , and: \\\\Delta x = v_{x} \\\\Delta t Remember that a is still a function of time. The simplest way to solve these is just the Euler algorithm, which in essence is the linear addition described above. Limiting ourselves to 1 dimension only in some general computer language: a.old = gravitationfunction(x.old) x.new = x.old + v.old * dt v.new = v.old + a.old * dt As in essence the acceleration used for the whole duration of the timestep, is the one as it was in the beginning of the timestep, this simple method has no high accuracy. Much better results are achieved by taking a mean acceleration, the average between the beginning value and the expected (unperturbed) end value: a.old = gravitationfunction(x.old) x.expect = x.old + v.old * dt a.expect = gravitationfunction(x.expect) v.new = v.old + (a.old + a.expect) * 0.5 * dt x.new = x.old + (v.new + v.old) * 0.5 * dt Of course still better results can be expected by taking intermediate values. This is what happens when using the Runge-Kutta method, especially the one of grade 4 or 5 are most useful. The most common method used is the leapfrog method due to its good long term energy conservation. A completely different method is the use of Taylor series. In that case we write: r = r_0 + r'_0 t + r_0 \\\\frac{t^2}{2!} + ... but rather than developing up to some higher derivative in r only, one can develop in r and v (that is r') by writing r = f r_0 + g r'_0and then write out the factors f and g in a series. Approximations To calculate the accelerations the gravitational attraction of each body on each other body is to be taken into account. As a consequence the amount of calculation in the simulation goes up with the square of the number of bodies: Doubling the number of bodies increases the work with a factor four. To increase the accuracy of the simulation not only more decimals are to be taken but also smaller timesteps, again quickly increasing the amount of work. Evidently tricks are to be applied to reduce the amount of work. Some of these tricks are given here. By far the most important trick is the use of a proper integration method, as already outlined above. The choice of units is important. Rather than to work in SI units, which would make some values extremely small and some extremely large, all units are to be scaled such that they are in the neighbourhood of 1. For example, for distances in the Solar System the astronomical unit is most straightforward. If this is not done one is almost certain to see a simulation abandoned in the middle of a calculation on a floating point overflow or underflow, and if not that bad, still accuracy is likely to get lost due to truncation errors. If N is large (not so much in Solar System simulations, but more in galaxy simulations) it is customary to create dynamic groups of bodies. All bodies in a particular direction and on large distance from the reference body, which is being calculated at that moment, are taken together and their gravitational attraction is averaged over the whole group. The total amount of energy and angular momentum of a closed system are conserved quantities. By calculating these amounts after every time step the simulation can be programmed to increase the stepsize Œît if they do not change significantly, and to reduce it if they start to do so. Combining the bodies in groups as in the previous and apply larger and thus less timesteps on the faraway bodies than on the closer ones, is also possible. To allow for an excessively rapid change of the acceleration when a particular body is close to the reference body, it is customary to introduce a small parameter e so that a = \\\\frac{G M}{r^2 + e} Complications If the highest possible accuracy is needed, the calculations become much more complex. In the case of comets, nongravitational forces, such as radiation pressure and gas drag, must be taken into account. In the case of Mercury, and other planets for long term calculations, relativistic effects cannot be ignored. Then also the total energy is no longer a constant (because the four vector energy with linear momentum is). The finite speed of light also makes it important to allow for light-time effects, both classical and relativistic. Planets can no longer be considered as particles, but their shape and density must also be considered. For example, the flattening of the Earth causes precession, which causes the axial tilt to change, which affects the long-term movements of all planets. Long term models, going beyond a few tens of millions of years, are not possible due to the lack of stability of the Solar System.

He was Archbishop of Genoa from 1995 to 2002 and Archbishop of Milan from 2002 to 2011. Early years Tettamanzi was born on 14 March 1934 in Renate, then in the province of Milan, now in the province of Monza and Brianza. He was educated at the Minor Seminary of Seveso and the Seminary of Venegono Inferiore and finally at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome where he earned a doctorate in theology. After studying in local seminaries, he was ordained a priest on 28 June 1957 by Archbishop Giovanni Battista Montini, the future Pope Paul VI. He served in the Archdiocese of Milan as a pastor and faculty member at the Minor Seminary of Masnago and of Seveso San Pietro from 1960 until 1966. He was a faculty member of the Seminary of Venegono from 1966 to 1986. Bishop On 1 July 1989 Pope John Paul II named Tettamanzi Archbishop of Ancona-Osimo. He received his episcopal consecration from Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini at the Milan cathedral on 23 September. Tettamanzi submitted his resignation as bishop on 6 April 1991 to take up a five-year assignment as Secretary-General of the Italian Episcopal Conference. Extensive biography. John Paul II appointed him Archbishop of Genoa on 20 April 1995. He helped John Paul draft his 1995 encyclical Evangelium Vitae (1995). At the consistory of 21 February 1998, Tettamanzi was created Cardinal-Priest of Ss. Ambrogio e Carlo. He was named to succeed Martini as archbishop of Milan on 11 July 2002. Although thought one of the favorite candidates to succeed John Paul II in 2005, there were reports that he received few votes in the conclave. Tettamanzi was said to speak only Italian. He was little known outside his own country. In 2006, giving the opening address at the decennial conference of the Italian Catholic Church, he challenged the traditional alliance of the hierarchy with the country's conservative parties and called for more flexibility in forming alliances in contrast to the preference of Cardinal Camillo Ruini, head of the Italian Episcopal Conference, for Silvio Berlusconi. He said: \\"It is better to be Christian without saying it, than to proclaim it without being it.\\" In response to Pope Benedict's Summorum Pontificum of July 2007, Tettamanzi stated that the rules it presented for the celebration of the Mass in different forms did not apply to the Milan archdiocese since it uses the Ambrosian Rite rather than the Roman. In March 2009, as required upon reaching the age of 75, he submitted his resignation, and Pope Benedict accepted it on the 54th anniversary of his ordination to the priesthood, 28 June 2011. In retirement, Tettamanzi lived at the , a retreat house of the Milan Archdiocese, in Triuggio. In July 2012, he was named apostolic administrator of the Diocese of Vigevano. He served in that post for a year. He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2013 papal conclave that selected Pope Francis. In 2015, at the behest of Pope Francis, he produced a study of the feasibility of creating a Dicastery for the Laity, Family and Life for consideration by the Council of Cardinals. In September 2015, Pope Francis nominated him to participate in the Synod on the Family in October. He supported, under certain conditions, admitting the divorced and remarried to the Eucharist. He died on 5 August 2017, after a long illness. Cardinal Tettamanzi is buried in the metropolitan Cathedral of Milan. Views=Social relations In his speech on St. Ambrose day in 2008, he said that Muslims have the right to build their mosques in the cities of predominantly Catholic countries. In his speech on St. Ambrose day 2010 he defended immigrants to Italy against attempts to classify them as criminals. Remarried Catholics In 2008, in a letter addressed to Catholics who had divorced and remarried, he wrote: He said he wanted to \\"establish dialogue ... to try to hear about your daily life, to allow myself to be questioned by some of your questions.... The Church has not forgotten nor rejected you, nor does it consider you unworthy. For the Church, and for me, as a bishop, you are my beloved brothers and sisters.\\" In 2014, he published Il Vangelo della misericordia per le famiglie ferite (The Gospel of Mercy for Wounded Families) and said he anticipated allowing divorced and remarried Catholics to receive communion as long as there is no confusion about the Church's insistence on the indissolubility of marriage and there is \\"a restored commitment to Christian life through faithful paths that are true and serious.\\" References External links  *Archdiocese of Milan 1934 births 2017 deaths People from the Province of Milan Italian cardinals Roman Catholic archbishops of Genoa Archbishops of Milan Cardinals created by Pope John Paul II Pontifical Gregorian University alumni Members of the Congregation for the Clergy Members of the Congregation for Catholic Education Members of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches People from Brianza Members of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre ","title":"Dionigi Tettamanzi"},{"id":"1355027","text":"Cl√°udio Hummes, OFM (, born 8 August 1934) is a Brazilian Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church. He was prefect of the Congregation for the Clergy from 2006 to 2010, having served as Archbishop of Fortaleza from 1996 to 1998 and Archbishop of S√£o Paulo from 1998 to 2006. A member of the Order of Friars Minor and an outspoken proponent of social justice, he was made a cardinal in 2001. Early life Auri Alfonso Hummes was born in the city of Montenegro to Pedro Ad√£o Hummes, a German-Brazilian, and Maria Frank, a German. Taking the name Cl√°udio upon his profession as a Franciscan, he was ordained to the priesthood on 3 August 1958 by Archbishop Jo√£o Resende Costa. He obtained a doctorate in philosophy in 1963 from the Pontifical University Antonianum in Rome. From 1963 until 1968, he taught philosophy at the Franciscan seminary in Garibaldi, the major seminary of Viam√£o and at the Pontifical Catholic University of Porto Alegre. He then studied at the Ecumenical Institute of Bossey in Geneva, Switzerland, from where he received an specialization in ecumenism. He was adviser for ecumenical affairs to the National Bishops' Conference of Brazil, Provincial Superior of the Franciscans of Rio Grande do Sul (1972‚Äì1975), and president of the Union of Latin American Conferences of Franciscans. Along with his native Portuguese and Riograndenser Hunsr√ºckisch, a regional German dialect of southern Brazil, he can also speak French, Spanish, High-German, and Italian. Bishop On 22 March 1975, he was appointed Coadjutor Bishop of Santo Andr√© and Titular Bishop of Carcabia. Hummes received his episcopal consecration on the following 25 May from Archbishop Alo√≠sio Lorscheider, OFM, with Bishops Mauro Morelli and Urbano Allgayer serving as co-consecrators. He later succeeded Jorge de Oliveira as Bishop of Santo Andr√© on 29 December of that same year. Hummes allowed the labour unions to meet in parishes throughout his diocese, going against the dictatorship in Brazil at the time. It was here that he began his support for liberation theology, and forged his friendship with the union boss at the time, Lula. On 29 May 1996 he was promoted to Archbishop of Fortaleza and was then transferred to S√£o Paulo on 15 April 1998. Cardinal He was created Cardinal-Priest of S. Antonio da Padova in Via Merulana by Pope John Paul II in the consistory of 21 February 2001. He later preached the Lenten spiritual exercises for John Paul II and the Roman Curia in 2002. One of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI, Cardinal Hummes was often mentioned as a possible successor to Pope John Paul II. Cardinal Hummes has Curial membership of Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Congregation for Bishops, Congregation for Catholic Education, Pontifical Council for the Laity, Pontifical Council for the Family, Pontifical Council Cor Unum, Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, Pontifical Council for Culture, Pontifical Commission for Latin America, X Ordinary Council of the General Secretariat of the Synod of Bishops, Council of Cardinals for the Study of Organizational, and Prefecture for the Economic Affairs of the Holy See. He held membership of these dicastaries until his 80th birthday. On 31 October 2006 Pope Benedict appointed Cardinal Hummes to head the Congregation for the Clergy. In 2013 he served as one of the 115 cardinals in the conclave that elected Pope Francis. When the new Pope won the conclave ballot, Cardinal Hummes whispered to the Pope, \\"Don't forget the poor people\\" and the Pope said that immediately he remembered St. Francis of Assisi and \\"the name Francis came into my heart\\". When the newly elected Pope Francis appeared on the balcony shortly after his election, Cardinal Hummes was among the cardinals who accompanied the new pope and stood beside him at his immediate left on the balcony. Recounting the moment of his election, Pope Francis told thousands of journalists on March 16 that Cardinal Hummes \\"hugged me, kissed me and said, 'Don't forget the poor.'\\" Francis also said he took to heart the words of his \\"great friend\\" Cardinal Hummes and chose to be called after St. Francis of Assisi, \\"the man of poverty, the man of peace, the man who loves and protects creation,\\" the same created world \\"with which we don't have such a good relationship.\\" A year later, Cardinal Hummes was appointed honorary president of the Pan-Amazonian Ecclesial Network (REPAM), established in 2014 in Brasilia, Brazil, during a meeting of bishops whose territories include Amazon regions, priests, missionaries of congregations who work in the Amazon jungle, national representatives of Caritas and laypeople belonging to various Church bodies. In his message, he reiterated that the creation of the Pan-Amazon Ecclesial Network ‚Äúrepresents a new incentive and relaunch of the work of the Church in Amazonia, strongly desired by the Holy Father. There, the Church wishes to be, with courage and determination, a missionary Church, merciful, prophetic, and close to all the people, especially the poorest, the excluded, the discarded, the forgotten and wounded. A Church with an 'Amazonian face' and a 'native clergy', as Pope Francis proposed in his address to the bishops of Brazil‚Äù. Climate activism  On 29 November 2015, ahead of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference Cardinal Hummes appeared again in the world's global media stage when him and Avaaz campaigner Oscar Soria displayed a pair of shoes donated by Pope Francis to support a climate demonstration in Paris, in a defiance to French authorities that banned public protests in the aftermath of the November 2015 Paris attacks. Originally, hundreds of thousands were expected to march in Paris that day, but the march was canceled after the attacks. Instead, Parisians and others from around the world donated shoes and set them up at Place de la Republique, in a symbolic march organized by the civic movement Avaaz that got the support of Pope Francis. ‚ÄúThis is a very important and also very emotional moment, the Pope wanted to personally participate symbolically just like all of us who have put our shoes, we want to participate symbolically to the worldwide march for climate change here in Paris,‚Äù Cardinal Hummes told journalists at the event. \\"We ask for drastic cuts of carbon emissions to keep the global temperature rise below the dangerous threshold of 1.5¬∞C,\\" the cardinal said before international media. \\"As the bishops' appeal states, we need to 'put an end to the fossil fuel era' and 'set a goal for complete decarbonisation by 2050 (...) And we ask wealthier countries to aid the world's poorest to cope with climate change impacts, by providing robust climate finance,\\" he added. Recounting that event, Cardinal Hummes later said: \\"I had the privilege, along with Oscar Soria from Avaaz, to bring the shoes of Pope Francis. There were lots of expectations, it was a great and symbolically strong way of pressure from the people, and as well the presence of Pope Francis, in this clamor to avert climate change\\". Views=Economic issues Cardinal Hummes has criticized the spread of global capitalism, claiming that privatizing state companies and lowering tariffs had contributed to \\"misery and poverty affecting millions around the world\\". At his first public audience following his election, Pope Francis revealed that he had been inspired to take his name from St Francis of Assisi by his good friend Cardinal Hummes who had embraced him at the culmination of the 2013 conclave whispering \\"don't forget the poor\\" when it was announced that he had been elected Pope. Indigenous people He issued an official statement condemning the anonymous attacks on homeless indigenous people. He said \\"such violence and cruelty is unacceptable and should be vigorously repudiated. The Church has cried out many times regarding the need to come to the aid of those who are forced to live in our streets, without shelter. She does so out of a duty of humanity and because of her faith in Jesus Christ, who wishes to be identified in each person, especially in the poor and handicapped\\". Clerical celibacy In a 2006 interview with Brazilian newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo, Cardinal Hummes said that \\"even though celibacy is part of Catholic history and culture, the Church could review this question, because celibacy is not a dogma but a disciplinary question.\\" He also said that it is \\"a long and valuable tradition in the Latin-rite church, based on strong theological and pastoral arguments\\". Contraception Hummes has reprimanded priests who attack Catholic teachings about condoms.

Service In 1963 Sealion was carrying out surveillance operations against a Soviet naval exercise when she was detected by Soviet warships and forced to surface. Between 1976 and 1977 she was commanded by J K Boyle. Sealion attended the 1977 Silver Jubilee Fleet Review off Spithead when she was part of the Submarine Flotilla.Official Souvenir Programme, 1977.

Formed as a subsidiary of the Scottish Bus Group in July 1989 from the merger of Kelvin Scottish and Central Scottish, it was sold in a management buyout and in July 1998 became part of First Glasgow.

By the time the dispute was resolved a number of new operators had stepped in to take on the abandoned services. Whereas Kelvin had been one of the more successful of the Scottish Bus Group subsidiaries, Central was financially weakened, suffered from heavy competition and burdened with a large debt. KCB was the largest operator in Dumbartonshire and Lanarkshire operating services in the towns of Airdrie, Cumbernauld, Dumbarton, Hamilton and Kirkintilloch, Motherwell as well as in the city of Glasgow. A cream and red livery was adopted. In 1990, KCB ceased to operate Scottish Citylink services with the profit margin deemed insufficient. As part of the Scottish Bus Group, only one bid was lodged, a management buyout with the sale effective from 18 February 1991. KCB relied on second hand purchases until it became profitable. In 1993 the company purchased its first new buses; Alexander Strider bodied Volvo B10Bs, Alexander Dash bodied Volvo B6s and Alexander Royale bodied Volvo Olympians. In October 1994 the business was sold to Strathclyde Buses.Summary of SB Holdings Limited & Kelvin Central Buses Limited: A report on the merger situation Competition Commission April 1994 Many of the smaller independent operators that competed heavily with Kelvin Central were successfully purchased, paving the way for Kelvin Central to become the dominant operator once again in much of Lanarkshire but also giving it a rather mixed and sometimes rather elderly fleet. At that time, Stagecoach Western Scottish were poised to launch a network of Glasgow city services under the Stagecoach Glasgow banner, competing directly with Strathclyde Buses and Kelvin Central. Weeks before these new services were due to commence, Stagecoach acquired a 20% stake in SB Holdings in October 1994 (Strathclyde Buses and Kelvin Central Buses parent group) and a bus war was averted. The Monopolies & Mergers Commission found the Stagecoach stake in the combined company to be against the public interest and ordered Stagecoach to divest its 20% share in the firm early in 1995.Stagecoach Holdings plc and SB Holdings Limited: A report on the merger situation Competition Commission 1995Stagecoach set record of same The Independent 24 December 1995 The ownership issue was not to be resolved until June 1996, when FirstBus purchased SB Holdings, including Stagecoach's 20% shareholding.Takeover nets bus workers ¬£35,000 The Independent 10 May 1996FirstBus plc and SB Holdings Limited: A report on the merger situation Competition Commission 1997 A new all-over red livery was adopted for the combined company, and the KCB Network trading name was replaced with Kelvin, and later First Kelvin.

It consists of one or more uninsulated electrical cables (commonly multiples of three for three-phase power) suspended by towers or poles. Since most of the insulation is provided by the surrounding air, overhead power lines are generally the least costly method of power transmission for large quantities of electric energy. Construction Overhead powerline Dnieper crossing, Ukraine Towers for support of the lines are made of wood either grown or laminated, steel or aluminum (either lattice structures or tubular poles), concrete, and occasionally reinforced plastics. The bare wire conductors on the line are generally made of aluminum (either plain or reinforced with steel or composite materials such as carbon and glass fiber), though some copper wires are used in medium-voltage distribution and low-voltage connections to customer premises. A major goal of overhead power line design is to maintain adequate clearance between energized conductors and the ground so as to prevent dangerous contact with the line, and to provide reliable support for the conductors, resilience to storms, ice loads, earthquakes and other potential damage causes.Donald G. Fink and H. Wayne Beaty, Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers, Eleventh Edition, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1978, , Chapter 14 Overhead Power Transmission Today overhead lines are routinely operated at voltages exceeding 765,000 volts between conductors.  Classification of transmission lines  A man working on powerlines in Nauru (2007)  By operating voltage  Overhead power transmission lines are classified in the electrical power industry by the range of voltages: * Low voltage (LV) ‚Äì less than 1000 volts, used for connection between a residential or small commercial customer and the utility. * Medium voltage (MV; distribution) ‚Äì between 1000 volts (1 kV) and 69 kV, used for distribution in urban and rural areas. * High voltage (HV; subtransmission less than 100 kV; subtransmission or transmission at voltages such as 115 kV and 138 kV), used for sub-transmission and transmission of bulk quantities of electric power and connection to very large consumers. * Extra high voltage (EHV; transmission) ‚Äì from 345 kV, up to about 800 kV, used for long distance, very high power transmission. * Ultra high voltage (UHV) ‚Äì higher than 800 kV. The Financial Times reported UHV lines are a \\"game changer\\", making a global electricity grid potentially feasible. StateGrid said that compared to conventional lines, UHV enables the transmission of five times more power, over six times the distance.  By length of the line  The overhead transmission line is generally categorized into three classes,CL Wadhwa, Electrical Power Systems, Seventh Multicolour Edition, New Age International (P) Limited, New Delhi, 2017, , Chapter 2 Performance of Lines depending on the length of the line: * The transmission lines which have a length less than 60 km are generally referred to as short transmission lines. * The transmission line having its effective length more than 80 km but less than 250 km is generally referred to as a medium transmission line. * A transmission line having a length more than 250 km is considered as a long transmission line. This categorization is mainly done for the ease of performance analysis of transmission lines, by power engineers. Structures Structures for overhead lines take a variety of shapes depending on the type of line. Structures may be as simple as wood poles directly set in the earth, carrying one or more cross-arm beams to support conductors, or \\"armless\\" construction with conductors supported on insulators attached to the side of the pole. Tubular steel poles are typically used in urban areas. High-voltage lines are often carried on lattice-type steel towers or pylons. For remote areas, aluminum towers may be placed by helicopters. Concrete poles have also been used. Poles made of reinforced plastics are also available, but their high cost restricts application. Each structure must be designed for the loads imposed on it by the conductors. The weight of the conductor must be supported, as well as dynamic loads due to wind and ice accumulation, and effects of vibration. Where conductors are in a straight line, towers need only resist the weight since the tension in the conductors approximately balances with no resultant force on the structure. Flexible conductors supported at their ends approximate the form of a catenary, and much of the analysis for construction of transmission lines relies on the properties of this form. A large transmission line project may have several types of towers, with \\"tangent\\" (\\"suspension\\" or \\"line\\" towers, UK) towers intended for most positions and more heavily constructed towers used for turning the line through an angle, dead-ending (terminating) a line, or for important river or road crossings. Depending on the design criteria for a particular line, semi-flexible type structures may rely on the weight of the conductors to be balanced on both sides of each tower. More rigid structures may be intended to remain standing even if one or more conductors is broken. Such structures may be installed at intervals in power lines to limit the scale of cascading tower failures. Foundations for tower structures may be large and costly, particularly if the ground conditions are poor, such as in wetlands. Each structure may be stabilized considerably by the use of guy wires to counteract some of the forces applied by the conductors. low-profile power lines near an airfield Power lines and supporting structures can be a form of visual pollution. In some cases the lines are buried to avoid this, but this \\"undergrounding\\" is more expensive and therefore not common. For a single wood utility pole structure, a pole is placed in the ground, then three crossarms extend from this, either staggered or all to one side. The insulators are attached to the crossarms. For an \\"H\\"-type wood pole structure, two poles are placed in the ground, then a crossbar is placed on top of these, extending to both sides. The insulators are attached at the ends and in the middle. Lattice tower structures have two common forms. One has a pyramidal base, then a vertical section, where three crossarms extend out, typically staggered. The strain insulators are attached to the crossarms. Another has a pyramidal base, which extends to four support points. On top of this a horizontal truss-like structure is placed. A grounded wire is sometimes strung along the tops of the towers to provide lightning protection. An optical ground wire is a more advanced version with embedded optical fibers for communication. Overhead wire markers can be mounted on the ground wire to meet International Civil Aviation Organization recommendations. Some markers include flashing lamps for night-time warning. Circuits A single-circuit transmission line carries conductors for only one circuit. For a three-phase system, this implies that each tower supports three conductors. A double- circuit transmission line has two circuits. For three-phase systems, each tower supports and insulates six conductors. Single phase AC-power lines as used for traction current have four conductors for two circuits. Usually both circuits operate at the same voltage. In HVDC systems typically two conductors are carried per line, but in rare cases only one pole of the system is carried on a set of towers. In some countries, such as Germany, most power lines with voltages above 100 kV are implemented as double, quadruple or in rare cases even hextuple power line as rights of way are rare. Sometimes all conductors are installed with the erection of the pylons; often some circuits are installed later. A disadvantage of double circuit transmission lines is that maintenance can be difficult, as either work in close proximity of high voltage or switch-off of two circuits is required. In case of failure, both systems can be affected. The largest double-circuit transmission line is the Kita-Iwaki Powerline.

Insulators Medium- voltage power lines with ceramic insulators in California Modular suspension insulators are used for high-voltage lines. The objects attached to the conductors near the bottom of the insulator are Stockbridge dampers. Insulators must support the conductors and withstand both the normal operating voltage and surges due to switching and lightning. Insulators are broadly classified as either pin-type, which support the conductor above the structure, or suspension type, where the conductor hangs below the structure. The invention of the strain insulator was a critical factor in allowing higher voltages to be used. At the end of the 19th century, the limited electrical strength of telegraph-style pin insulators limited the voltage to no more than 69,000 volts. Up to about 33 kV (69 kV in North America) both types are commonly used. At higher voltages only suspension-type insulators are common for overhead conductors. Insulators are usually made of wet-process porcelain or toughened glass, with increasing use of glass-reinforced polymer insulators. However, with rising voltage levels, polymer insulators (silicone rubber based) are seeing increasing usage.NGK-Locke Polymer insulator manufacturer China has already developed polymer insulators having a highest system voltage of 1100 kV and India is currently developing a 1200 kV (highest system voltage) line which will initially be charged with 400 kV to be upgraded to a 1200 kV line. Suspension insulators are made of multiple units, with the number of unit insulator disks increasing at higher voltages. The number of disks is chosen based on line voltage, lightning withstand requirement, altitude, and environmental factors such as fog, pollution, or salt spray. In cases where these conditions are suboptimal, longer insulators must be used. Longer insulators with longer creepage distance for leakage current, are required in these cases. Strain insulators must be strong enough mechanically to support the full weight of the span of conductor, as well as loads due to ice accumulation, and wind.Advanced Rubber Products - Suspension Insulators Porcelain insulators may have a semi-conductive glaze finish, so that a small current (a few milliamperes) passes through the insulator. This warms the surface slightly and reduces the effect of fog and dirt accumulation. The semiconducting glaze also ensures a more even distribution of voltage along the length of the chain of insulator units. Polymer insulators by nature have hydrophobic characteristics providing for improved wet performance. Also, studies have shown that the specific creepage distance required in polymer insulators is much lower than that required in porcelain or glass. Additionally, the mass of polymer insulators (especially in higher voltages) is approximately 50% to 30% less than that of a comparative porcelain or glass string. Better pollution and wet performance is leading to the increased use of such insulators. Insulators for very high voltages, exceeding 200 kV, may have grading rings installed at their terminals. This improves the electric field distribution around the insulator and makes it more resistant to flash-over during voltage surges. Conductors Sample cross-section of ACSR power line The most common conductor in use for transmission today is aluminum conductor steel reinforced (ACSR). Also seeing much use is all-aluminum-alloy conductor (AAAC). Aluminum is used because it has about half the weight and lower cost of a comparable resistance copper cable. It does, however, require a larger diameter than copper because of lower specific conductivity. Copper was more popular in the past and is still in use, especially at lower voltages and for grounding. While larger conductors lose less energy because of their lower electrical resistance, they cost more than smaller conductors. An optimization rule called Kelvin's Law states that the optimum size of conductor for a line is found when the cost of the energy wasted in a smaller conductor is equal to the annual interest paid on that additional cost of the line construction for a larger conductor. The optimization problem is made more complex by additional factors such as varying annual load, varying cost of installation, and the discrete sizes of cable that are commonly made. Since a conductor is a flexible object with uniform weight per unit length, the shape of a conductor hanging between two towers approximates that of a catenary. The sag of the conductor (vertical distance between the highest and lowest point of the curve) varies depending on the temperature and additional load such as ice cover. A minimum overhead clearance must be maintained for safety. Since the length of the conductor increases with increasing heat produced by the current through it, it is sometimes possible to increase the power handling capacity (uprate) by changing the conductors for a type with a lower coefficient of thermal expansion or a higher allowable operating temperature. Conventional ACSR (left) and modern carbon core (right) conductors Two such conductors that offer reduced thermal sag are known as composite core conductors (ACCR and ACCC conductor). In lieu of steel core strands that are often used to increase overall conductor strength, the ACCC conductor uses a carbon and glass fiber core that offers a coefficient of thermal expansion about 1/10 of that of steel. While the composite core is nonconductive, it is substantially lighter and stronger than steel, which allows the incorporation of 28% more aluminum (using compact trapezoidal-shaped strands) without any diameter or weight penalty. The added aluminum content helps reduce line losses by 25 to 40% compared to other conductors of the same diameter and weight, depending upon electric current. The carbon core conductor's reduced thermal sag allows it to carry up to twice the current (\\"ampacity\\") compared to all-aluminum conductor (AAC) or ACSR. The power lines and their surroundings must be maintained by linemen, sometimes assisted by helicopters with pressure washers or circular saws which may work three times faster. However this work often occurs in the dangerous areas of the helicopter height‚Äìvelocity diagram,Harnesk, Tommy. \\"Helikoptermonterad motors√•g snabbkapar tr√§den\\" Ny Teknik, 9 January 2015. Accessed: 12 January 2015. and the pilot must be qualified for this \\"human external cargo\\" method. Bundle conductors A bundle conductor For transmission of power across long distances, high voltage transmission is employed. Transmission higher than 132 kV poses the problem of corona discharge, which causes significant power loss and interference with communication circuits. To reduce this corona effect, it is preferable to use more than one conductor per phase, or bundled conductors.Grainger, John J. and W. D. Stevenson Jr. Power System Analysis and Design, 2nd edition. McGraw Hill (1994). In addition to reducing corona, audible and radio noise (and associated electrical losses), bundled conductors also increase the amount of current that can be carried compared to a single conductor of equal aluminum content due to the skin effect (for AC lines). Bundle conductors consist of several parallel cables connected at intervals by spacers, often in a cylindrical configuration. The optimum number of conductors depends on the current rating, but typically higher-voltage lines also have higher current. American Electric Power is building 765 kV lines using six conductors per phase in a bundle. Spacers must resist the forces due to wind, and magnetic forces during a short circuit. Spacer damper for four-conductor bundles Bundle conductor attachment Bundled conductors reduce the voltage gradient in the vicinity of the line. This reduces the possibility of corona discharge. At extra high voltage, the electric field gradient at the surface of a single conductor is high enough to ionize air, which wastes power, generates unwanted audible noise and interferes with communication systems. The field surrounding a bundle of conductors is similar to the field that would surround a single, very large conductor‚Äîthis produces lower gradients which mitigates issues associated with high field strength. The transmission efficiency is improved as loss due to corona effect is countered. Bundled conductors cool themselves more efficiently due to the increased surface area of the conductors, further reducing line losses. When transmitting alternating current, bundle conductors also avoid the reduction in ampacity of a single large conductor due to the skin effect. A bundle conductor also has lower reactance, compared to a single conductor. While wind resistance is higher, wind-induced oscillation can be damped at bundle spacers. The ice and wind loading of bundled conductors will be greater than a single conductor of the same total cross section, and bundled conductors are more difficult to install than single conductors. Aeolian vibration is generally less pronounced on bundled conductors due to the effect of spacers and spacer dampers installed at relatively close intervals along the line. Ground wires Aluminum conductor crosslinked polyethylene insulation wire. It is used for 6600V power lines. Overhead power lines are often equipped with a ground conductor (shield wire, static wire, or overhead earth wire). The ground conductor is usually grounded (earthed) at the top of the supporting structure, to minimize the likelihood of direct lightning strikes to the phase conductors. In circuits with earthed neutral, it also serves as a parallel path with the earth for fault currents. Very high-voltage transmission lines may have two ground conductors. These are either at the outermost ends of the highest cross beam, at two V-shaped mast points, or at a separate cross arm. Older lines may use surge arresters every few spans in place of a shield wire; this configuration is typically found in the more rural areas of the United States. By protecting the line from lightning, the design of apparatus in substations is simplified due to lower stress on insulation. Shield wires on transmission lines may include optical fibers (optical ground wires/OPGW), used for communication and control of the power system. HVDC Fenno-Skan with ground wires used as electrode line At some HVDC converter stations, the ground wire is used also as the electrode line to connect to a distant grounding electrode. This allows the HVDC system to use the earth as one conductor. The ground conductor is mounted on small insulators bridged by lightning arrestors above the phase conductors. The insulation prevents electrochemical corrosion of the pylon. Medium-voltage distribution lines may also use one or two shield wires, or may have the grounded conductor strung below the phase conductors to provide some measure of protection against tall vehicles or equipment touching the energized line, as well as to provide a neutral line in Wye wired systems. On some power lines for very high voltages in the former Soviet Union, the ground wire is used for PLC-radio systems and mounted on insulators at the pylons. Insulated conductors and cable Overhead insulated cables are rarely used, usually for short distances (less than a kilometer). Insulated cables can be directly fastened to structures without insulating supports. An overhead line with bare conductors insulated by air is typically less costly than a cable with insulated conductors. A more common approach is \\"covered\\" line wire. It is treated as bare cable, but often is safer for wildlife, as the insulation on the cables increases the likelihood of a large-wing-span raptor to survive a brush with the lines, and reduces the overall danger of the lines slightly. These types of lines are often seen in the eastern United States and in heavily wooded areas, where tree-line contact is likely. The only pitfall is cost, as insulated wire is often costlier than its bare counterpart. Many utility companies implement covered line wire as jumper material where the wires are often closer to each other on the pole, such as an underground riser/pothead, and on reclosers, cutouts and the like.  Dampers  A Stockbridge damper Because power lines can suffer from aeroelastic flutter and \\"galloping\\" oscillations driven by wind, tuned mass dampers are often attached to the line, to change the characteristics of the line's physical oscillations. A common type is the Stockbridge damper. Compact transmission lines Medium-voltage compact overhead power line mounted on a concrete pole in Thailand. The appearance is similar to a bundle conductor, but this line consists of three conductors, which are attached to a single, cross-shaped porcellain insulator. A compact overhead transmission line requires a smaller right of way than a standard overhead powerline. Conductors must not get too close to each other. This can be achieved either by short span lengths and insulating crossbars, or by separating the conductors in the span with insulators. The first type is easier to build as it does not require insulators in the span, which may be difficult to install and to maintain. Examples of compact lines are: * Lutsk compact overhead powerline () * Hilpertsau-Weisenbach compact overhead line () Compact transmission lines may be designed for voltage upgrade of existing lines to increase the power that can be transmitted on an existing right of way.Beaty, H. Wayne; Fink, Donald G. , Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers (15th Edition) McGraw-Hill, 2007 978-0-07-144146-9 pages 14-105 through 14-106 Low voltage Aerial bundled cable in Old Coulsdon, Surrey Low voltage overhead lines may use either bare conductors carried on glass or ceramic insulators or an aerial bundled cable system. The number of conductors may be anywhere between two (most likely a phase and neutral) up to as many as six (three phase conductors, separate neutral and earth plus street lighting supplied by a common switch); a common case is four (three phase and neutral, where the neutral might also serve as a protective earthing conductor). Train power Overhead lines or overhead wires are used to transmit electrical energy to trams, trolleybuses or trains. Overhead line is designed on the principle of one or more overhead wires situated over rail tracks. Feeder stations at regular intervals along the overhead line supply power from the high-voltage grid. For some cases low-frequency AC is used, and distributed by a special traction current network. Further applications Overhead lines are also occasionally used to supply transmitting antennas, especially for efficient transmission of long, medium and short waves. For this purpose a staggered array line is often used. Along a staggered array line the conductor cables for the supply of the earth net of the transmitting antenna are attached on the exterior of a ring, while the conductor inside the ring, is fastened to insulators leading to the high-voltage standing feeder of the antenna. Use of area under overhead power lines Use of the area below an overhead line is limited because objects must not come too close to the energized conductors. Overhead lines and structures may shed ice, creating a hazard. Radio reception can be impaired under a power line, due both to shielding of a receiver antenna by the overhead conductors, and by partial discharge at insulators and sharp points of the conductors which creates radio noise. In the area surrounding the overhead lines, it is dangerous to risk interference, e.g. flying kites or balloons, using ladders, or operating machinery. Overhead distribution and transmission lines near airfields are often marked on maps, and the lines themselves marked with conspicuous plastic reflectors, to warn pilots of the presence of conductors. Construction of overhead power lines, especially in wilderness areas, may have significant environmental effects. Environmental studies for such projects may consider the effect of bush clearing, changed migration routes for migratory animals, possible access by predators and humans along transmission corridors, disturbances of fish habitat at stream crossings, and other effects. Linear parks may occupy the area under overhead power lines. Aviation accidents  An aviation obstruction marker on a high-voltage overhead transmission line reminds pilots of the presence of an overhead line.

It was the first commercially used power line which operated at 1150 kV, the highest transmission line voltage in the world. General aviation, hang gliding, paragliding, skydiving, balloon, and kite flying must avoid accidental contact with power lines. Nearly every kite product warns users to stay away from power lines. Deaths occur when aircraft crash into power lines. Some power lines are marked with obstruction makers, especially near air strips or over waterways that may support floatplane operations. The placement of power lines sometimes use up sites that would otherwise be used by hang gliders.Aircraft Accidents Due to Overhead Power LinesPacific Gas and Electric Company Reminds Customers About Flying Kites Safely. History The first transmission of electrical impulses over an extended distance was demonstrated on July 14, 1729 by the physicist Stephen Gray. The demonstration used damp hemp cords suspended by silk threads (the low resistance of metallic conductors not being appreciated at the time). However the first practical use of overhead lines was in the context of telegraphy. By 1837 experimental commercial telegraph systems ran as far as 20 km (13 miles). Electric power transmission was accomplished in 1882 with the first high-voltage transmission between Munich and Miesbach (60 km). 1891 saw the construction of the first three-phase alternating current overhead line on the occasion of the International Electricity Exhibition in Frankfurt, between Lauffen and Frankfurt. In 1912 the first 110 kV-overhead power line entered service followed by the first 220 kV-overhead power line in 1923. In the 1920s RWE AG built the first overhead line for this voltage and in 1926 built a Rhine crossing with the pylons of Voerde, two masts 138 meters high. In 1953, the first 345 kV line was put into service by American Electric Power in the United States. In Germany in 1957 the first 380 kV overhead power line was commissioned (between the transformer station and Rommerskirchen). In the same year the overhead line traversing of the Strait of Messina went into service in Italy, whose pylons served the Elbe crossing 1. This was used as the model for the building of the Elbe crossing 2 in the second half of the 1970s which saw the construction of the highest overhead line pylons of the world. Earlier, in 1952, the first 380 kV line was put into service in Sweden, in 1000 km (625 miles) between the more populated areas in the south and the largest hydroelectric power stations in the north. Starting from 1967 in Russia, and also in the US and Canada, overhead lines for voltage of 765 kV were built. In 1982 overhead power lines were built in Soviet Union between Elektrostal and the power station at Ekibastuz, this was a three-phase alternating current line at 1150 kV (Powerline Ekibastuz-Kokshetau). In 1999, in Japan the first powerline designed for 1000 kV with 2 circuits were built, the Kita-Iwaki Powerline. In 2003 the building of the highest overhead line commenced in China, the Yangtze River Crossing. Mathematical analysis An overhead power line is one example of a transmission line. At power system frequencies, many useful simplifications can be made for lines of typical lengths. For analysis of power systems, the distributed resistance, series inductance, shunt leakage resistance and shunt capacitance can be replaced with suitable lumped values or simplified networks. Short and medium line model A short length of a power line (less than 80 km) can be approximated with a resistance in series with an inductance and ignoring the shunt admittances. This value is not the total impedance of the line, but rather the series impedance per unit length of line. For a longer length of line (80‚Äì250 km), a shunt capacitance is added to the model. In this case it is common to distribute half of the total capacitance to each side of the line. As a result, the power line can be represented as a two-port network, such as with ABCD parameters.J. Glover, M. Sarma, and T. Overbye, Power System Analysis and Design, Fifth Edition, Cengage Learning, Connecticut, 2012, , Chapter 5 Transmission Lines: Steady- State Operation The circuit can be characterized as :Z = z l = (R + j \\\\omega L)l where *Z is the total series line impedance *z is the series impedance per unit length *l is the line length *\\\\omega \\\\ is the sinusoidal angular frequency The medium line has an additional shunt admittance :Y = y l = j \\\\omega C l where *Y is the total shunt line admittance *y is the shunt admittance per unit length File:Short Line Approximation.pngShort length of power line File:Med Line Approximation.pngMedium length of power line  Gallery  –ñ–Ω–∏–≤–∞ –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏.jpgOverhead power line 35 kV in Ukraine High voltage - panoramio.jpgOverhead power line 400 kV in Ko≈°ice Region, Slovakia Pylons in the Sunset - panoramio.jpgOverhead power line in Winterbourne, Gloucestershire –ö–æ—Ä–æ–Ω–Ω—ñ_—Ä–æ–∑—Ä—è–¥–∏_–Ω–∞_—Ñ–∞–∑–∞—Ö_–ü–õ_750_–∫–í.jpg Corona discharge on an insulator string of a 750 kV overhead power line Anchor pylon of high-voltage overhead power line 750 kV.jpgTriple pylon of overhead power line 750 kV, Zaporizhia Oblast Pylon ds.jpgOverhead power line in Gloucestershire, England H-frame suspension pylon Wisconsin US 2017.jpgH-frame suspension pylon near Trempealeau, Wisconsin Anchor pylon of overhead powerline.jpgOverhead power line 150 kV in Dnipro, Ukraine Leitung Kornwestheim 02112014 1.pngOverhead power line 380 kV in Germany T√°vvezet√©k a Fert≈ë utc√°ban.

Background Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee left Maj. Gen. Jubal A. Early to hold Fredericksburg on May 1, while he marched west with the rest of the Army of Northern Virginia to deal with Union Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker's main thrust at Chancellorsville with four corps of the Army of the Potomac. Early had his own division, along with William Barksdale's brigade from McLaws' division and cannons from the artillery reserve; Early was assisted by Brigadier General William Pendleton of the artillery reserve. Cadmus Wilcox's brigade arrived on May 3, increasing Early's strength to 12,000 men and 45 cannons. Most of the Confederate force was deployed south of Fredericksburg. Early was ordered by Lee to watch the remaining Union force near Fredericksburg; if he was attacked and defeated, he was to retreat southward to protect the Confederate supply lines. If the Union force moved to reinforce Hooker, then Early was to leave a covering force and rejoin Lee with the remainder of his troops.Gallagher, p. 40-41; Furgurson, pp. 257-61. On May 2, misunderstanding his orders, Early left one brigade at Fredericksburg and started the rest of his force towards Chancellorsville; Lee corrected the misunderstanding and Early then returned to his positions that night before Sedgwick discovered the Confederate retreat.Davis, p. 32. Union Troops before Fredericksburg May 1863 Maj. Gen. John Sedgwick was left near Fredericksburg with the VI Corps, the I Corps, and the II Corps division of Brig. Gen. John Gibbon. Hooker's plan called for Sedgwick to demonstrate near the city in order to deceive Lee about the Union plan. The VI and II Corps seized control of several crossings on April 29, laying down pontoon bridges in the early morning hours, and the divisions of William T. H. Brooks and James S. Wadsworth crossed the river. The I Corps was ordered to reinforce the main army at Chancellorsville during the night of May 1. During the evening of May 2, Sedgwick received orders to attack Early with his remaining forces.Sears, pp. 140-41, 169, 283-84, 309; Furgurson, pp. 97-100, 147. Opposing forces=UnionConfederate=Battle Confederate dead behind the stone wall of Marye's Heights, Fredericksburg, Virginia, May 3, 1863 Sedgwick moved his forces into Fredericksburg during dawn on May 3, uniting with Gibbon's division which had crossed the river just before dawn. Sedgwick originally planned to attack the ends of Marye's Heights but a canal and a stream blocked the Union forces. He then decided to launch an attack on the Confederate center on the heights, which was manned by Barksdale's brigade, with John Newton's division; this attack was defeated. Colonel Thomas M. Griffin of the 18th Mississippi Infantry granted the Union forces a truce in order to gather in their wounded. During this truce, the Union commanders noticed that the flank of Barksdale's left regiment was unprotected.Furgurson, pp. 256-58, 261-63. Sedgwick launched another attack against this flank and Barksdale's front using elements from all three VI Corps divisions, which pushed the Confederate forces off the ridge, capturing some artillery. The first men to mount the stone wall were from the 5th Wisconsin and the 6th Maine Infantry regiments. Barksdale retreated to Lee's Hill, where he attempted to make another stand but was again forced to retreat southward.Furgurson, pp. 263-67; Davis, pp. 36-37. Aftermath Map of Fredericksburg II Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program Confederate casualties totaled 700 men and four cannons. Early withdrew with his division two miles to the south, while Wilcox withdrew westward, slowing Sedgwick's advance. When he learned of the Confederate defeat, Lee started moving two divisions east to stop Sedgwick.Davis, p. 37; Sears, pp. 373-75; Furgurson, pp. 268-69. Following the campaign, Early became embroiled in an argument with Barksdale over what Barksdale considered a slight to his brigade in a newspaper letter that Early had written; the exchange continued until Lee ordered the two generals to cease.Gallagher, pp. 54-58. Sedgwick had lost 1,100 men during the engagement. At first he started to pursue Early's division but then followed the orders he received the previous day and started west along the Plank Road towards Hooker's army at Chancellorsville. Gibbon's division was left in Fredericksburg to guard the city.Sears, pp. 375-76; Furgurson, p. 267.

He is one of two living former Secretaries of Health, Education, and Welfare (the other is his predecessor, Forrest David Mathews). He has been Adjunct Professor of Public Health (Health Policy and Management) at Columbia University Medical School (Department of Psychiatry) and School of Public Health and is a member of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences. Early life Califano was born in Brooklyn, New York, on May 15, 1931, the son of Joseph Anthony Califano, Sr., and Katherine (Gill) Califano. He attended St. Gregory's Elementary School and Brooklyn Preparatory School in Brooklyn, New York. Califano received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the College of the Holy Cross, in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1952, and his LL.B. from Harvard Law School in 1955. In law school, he was a member of the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau and an editor of the Harvard Law Review. Military and Department of Defense In 1955, Califano enlisted in the United States Navy as an officer candidate. He was commissioned an ensign in November 1955, served three years in the Office of the Judge Advocate General in Washington, D.C., and was released to inactive duty in October 1958, as a lieutenant. He associated with the law firm of Dewey Ballantine in New York City from October 1958, until April 1961. In April 1961, Califano became Special Assistant to the General Counsel of the U. S. Department of Defense. In July 1962, he was appointed Special Assistant to the United States Secretary of the Army. On July 1, 1963, he was appointed General Counsel of the Army. He also served as Special Assistant to the Secretary of the Army for Civil Functions, supervising the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Civil Works Program and was a member of the President's Appalachian Regional Commission. In early 1964, Califano was selected to serve as the principal legal advisor to the United States Delegation to the Investigating Committee of the Organization of American States on the Panama riots of January 1964. Subsequently, he was also selected to present the United States case before the International Commission of Jurists during hearings held in Panama dealing with those riots. In recognition of his work as General Counsel of the Department of the Army, Califano was awarded the Distinguished Civilian Service Medal, the highest civilian award of the Army. On April 1, 1964, Califano was appointed Special Assistant to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense. He had special responsibilities for Department of Defense liaison with the Office of the President of the United States. He also acted as Executive Secretary of the President's Advisory Committee on Supersonic Transport, as the Department of Defense representative on the President's Committee on the Economic Impact of Defense and Disarmament, and as a member of the Federal Radiation Council. In recognition of his work as the Special Assistant to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense, Califano was awarded the Defense Distinguished Service Medal of the Department of Defense. Between March 21 and 25, 1965, Califano was assigned to monitor the progress of the historic March from Selma to Montgomery which helped ensure the passage of the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965.From Selma to Montgomery LBJ Presidential Library, Accessed April 23, 2015 Califano was appointed Special Assistant to President Lyndon B. Johnson on July 26, 1965. In this position, Califano served as LBJ's top domestic aide, developing the President's legislative program as well as helping coordinate economic policies and handling domestic crises. He also worked on a variety of domestic problems, including labor-management relations, balance of payments, health care, education, environmental and urban issues, and civil rights. He served in this position until January 20, 1969. While in this post, The New York Times called him \\"The Deputy President for Domestic Affairs.\\" Non-military career Califano was a member of the Washington law firm of Arnold & Porter from March 1969 until May 1971. He was a member of the Washington law firm of Williams, Connolly & Califano from June 1971 until January 1977. Califano was sworn in as Secretary of HEW. In January 1977, Califano became Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. He served in that Cabinet post until August 1979. He put the Department through the most complete reorganization in its twenty-five year history; created the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) to run Medicare and Medicaid; mounted major health promotion and disease prevention programs, including childhood immunization, the first national anti-smoking campaign, an alcoholism initiative, and issuance of Healthy People, the first Surgeon General's Report on Health Promotion and Disease Prevention which for the first time set health goals for the American people; began the collection of hundreds of millions of dollars of defaulted student loans, and instituted computerized techniques to police welfare, Medicare and Medicaid programs; worked with the Congress to maintain the financial integrity of the Social Security system, contain health care costs, and restructure Federal aid to elementary, secondary and higher education; and issued the first regulations to provide equal athletic opportunity to women under Title IX and to provide equal opportunity to the handicapped. However, initially he refused to sign meaningful regulations for Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which was the first U.S. federal civil rights protection for people with disabilities. After an ultimatum and deadline, demonstrations took place in ten U.S. cities on April 5, 1977 including the 504 Sit-in at the regional HEW offices. This sit-in, led by Judith Heumann and organized by Kitty Cone, lasted until April 30, 1977, 25 days, with more than 150 people refusing to leave. It is the longest non- violent sit-in at a federal building to date. Califano signed the regulations on April 28, 1977. As Secretary, Califano also funded the nation's first free standing hospice in Branford, CT, and issued regulations to make Medicare reimbursement available for hospice care. In 1979, as Secretary, Califano directed the Public Health Service to eliminate its official characterization of homosexuality as \\"a mental disease or defect\\" which immigration authorities had used to deny individuals entry to the United States solely because of their sexual orientation. President Jimmy Carter dismissed Califano on July 19, 1979. Afterwards, Congressman Charlie Wilson said of Califano's firing- \\"Good grief! He's cut down the tall trees and left the monkeys.\\"Barone, Michael; and Ujifusa, Grant. The Almanac of American Politics 1988', p. 1144. National Journal, 1987. Post-administration life In January 1980, Califano formed the law firm of Califano, Ross & Heineman in Washington, D.C. From 1983 until 1992, he was senior partner and head of the Washington office of Dewey Ballantine LLP. In 1987, New York governor Mario Cuomo appointed Califano Chair of the New York State Commission on Government Integrity; he was replaced a few months later by John Feerick, allegedly because Califano was not a New Yorker.Ethics panel is treading quietly, The New York Times, May 3, 1987 In 1992, he founded The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University. Califano has written articles for The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, Readers Digest, New Republic, Journal of the American Medical Association, The New England Journal of Medicine, America, The Washington Monthly, and other publications. He was Founding Chairman of the Board of the Institute for Social and Economic Policy in the Middle East at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. Califano is a director of CBS Corporation and Willis Group Holdings, Ltd. He is a Trustee of New York-Presbyterian Hospital, The Century Foundation, the Urban Institute, the Ditchley Foundation, the LBJ Foundation and the National Health Museum; Trustee Emeritus of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and a member of the advisory council of the American Foundation for AIDS Research and the Council on Foreign Relations. Awards In 2010, Califano received the Gustav O. Lienhard Award from the Institute of Medicine for his contributions to improving public health, his leadership in catalyzing federal action to curb smoking and his broader efforts to reduce the toll of addiction and substance abuse. In November 2011, the Columbia Spectator editorial board published a piece titled \\"Cut ties to CASA\\", stating that \\"the methods that CASA uses to research substance abuse are shoddy and questionable, and reports of CASA's \\"findings\\" are often misleading and sensationalized\\" and that \\"Califano's outlandish claims reflect on the integrity of the organization, and unfortunately on Columbia's as well.\\" Contrary to the claims made in the Spectator article, the organization's research staff has published more than 190 articles or book chapters in professional and peer-reviewed publications, including 121 articles in peer- reviewed journals including the Journal of the American Medical Association, the Journal of Adolescent Health, the Annals of Internal Medicine and the New England Journal of Medicine.

Also during the night, Sedgwick received no further orders from Hooker other than authorization to retreat across the river if Sedgwick thought the move was necessary.Furgurson, p. 285, Rogan, pp. 46-47. At 7 a.m. on May 4, Early recaptured Marye's Heights then turned west until he arrived at Sedgwick's main lines, halting after coming under heavy fire. During the remainder of the morning, Early launched a series of uncoordinated attacks on Sedgwick's position, all of which were defeated. By 11 a.m. on May 4 General Sedgwick was facing three directions; west towards Lee's main body and the Salem Church, south towards Anderson's division, and East towards Early's division. When General Sedgwick heard rumors that reinforcements from Richmond had arrived he felt his situation was becoming more difficult. He already had a six mile long line held by 20,000 troops against now 25,000 Confederates with only a bridgehead to retreat upon in failure, with more Confederates possibly arriving and himself with over 5,000 casualties he was concerned. He reported his difficult situation to General Hooker and requested the main army assist him. General Hooker, however, replied not to attack unless the main army did the same.Doubleday, Abner. (1882) Chancellorsville and Gettysburg. New York, New York: De Capo Press. Meanwhile, General Lee arrived at McLaws' headquarters at 11 a.m. and McLaws informed him that he did not feel strong enough to launch an attack and asked for reinforcements. Anderson was ordered to bring the other three brigades of his division and position them between McLaws and Early; he then launched additional attacks, which were also defeated.Sears, pp. 395-403; Rogan, pp. 47-48. General Benham of the U.S. Engineering Corps had added a bridge at Scott's Dam helping communicate with General Hooker. When the retreat was planned, General Benham on May 4 added a second bridge and he and General Sedgwick agreed to cross at night to avoid losing a large portion of his corps. At 6pm on the 4th of May the final Confederate attack was made and repulsed. The Union 6th Corps began retreating to a pre-planned smaller line closer to the bridges, and began their retreat without losses. Aftermath After dark, Sedgwick sent Hooker a message recommending that the VI Corps retreat across the river. After Hooker sent his approval at 1 a.m., Sedgwick withdrew across two pontoon bridges at Banks' Ford, completing the retreat about 4 a.m. Hearing that Sedgwick had been repulsed, Hooker abandoned the entire campaign, recrossing the main body of the Union army on the night of May 5 into May 6 to the north bank of the Rappahannock River back towards the Federal camp at Falmouth.Sears, pp. 423-29.

Description They consist of a number of small lengths of steel of different thicknesses with measurements marked on each piece. They are flexible enough that, even if they are all on the same hinge, several can be stacked together to gauge intermediate values. It is common to have two sets: one for imperial units (typically measured in thousandths of an inch), and one for metric (typically measured in hundredths of a millimetre) measurements. The same device with wires of specific diameter instead of flat blades is used to set the gap in spark plugs to the correct size; this is done by increasing or decreasing the gap until the gauge of the correct size just fits inside the gap.

RISC was led by David Patterson (who coined the term RISC) at the University of California, Berkeley between 1980 and 1984. The other project took place a short distance away at Stanford University under their MIPS effort starting in 1981 and running until 1984. Berkeley's project was so successful that it became the name for all similar designs to follow; even the MIPS would become known as a \\"RISC processor\\". The Berkeley RISC design was later commercialized by Sun Microsystems as the SPARC architecture, and inspired the ARM architecture. The RISC concept Both RISC and MIPS were developed from the realization that the vast majority of programs did not use the vast majority of a processor's instructions. In one calculation it was found that the entire Unix system, when compiled, used only 30% of the available instructions on the Motorola 68000. Much of the circuitry in the CPU was dedicated to decoding these instructions which were never being used. The RISC idea was to include only those instructions that were really used, using the space that had been used for the removed circuitry for other circuits that would speed the system up instead. To do this, RISC concentrated on adding many more registers, small bits of memory holding temporary values that can be accessed very rapidly. This contrasts with normal main memory, which might take several cycles to access. By providing more registers, and making sure the compilers actually used them, programs should run much faster. Additionally, the speed of the processor would be more closely defined by its clock speed, because less of its time would be spent waiting for memory accesses. Transistor for transistor, a RISC design would outperform a conventional CPU, hopefully by a lot. On the downside, the instructions being removed were generally performing several \\"sub-instructions\\". For instance, the \`ADD\` instruction of a traditional design would generally come in several flavours, one that added the numbers in two registers and placed it in a third, another that added numbers found in main memory and put the result in a register, etc. The RISC designs, on the other hand, included only a single flavour of any particular instruction, the \`ADD\`, for instance, would always use registers for all operands. This forced the programmer to write additional instructions to load the values from memory, if needed, making a RISC program \\"less dense\\". In the era of expensive memory this was a real concern, notably because memory was also much slower than the CPU. Since a RISC design's \`ADD\` would actually require four instructions (two loads, an add, and a save), the machine would have to do much more memory access to read the extra instructions, potentially slowing it down considerably. This was offset to some degree by the fact that the new designs used what was then a very large instruction word of 32-bits, allowing small constants to be folded directly into the instruction instead of having to be loaded separately. Additionally, the results of one operation are often used soon after by another, so by skipping the write to memory and storing the result in a register, the program did not end up much larger, and could in theory run much faster. For instance, a string of instructions carrying out a series of mathematical operations might require only a few loads from memory, while the majority of the numbers being used would be either constants in the instructions themselves or intermediate values left in the registers from previous calculations. In a sense, in this technique some registers are used to \\"shadow\\" memory locations, so that the registers are used as proxies for the memory locations until their final values after a group of instructions have been determined. To the casual observer, it was not clear that the RISC concept would improve performance, and it might even make it worse. The only way to be sure was to simulate it. The results of such simulations were clear; in test after test, every simulation showed an enormous overall benefit in performance from this design. Where the two projects, RISC and MIPS, differed was in the handling of the registers. MIPS simply added lots of registers and left it to the compilers (or assembly- language programmers) to make use of them. RISC, on the other hand, added circuitry to the CPU to \\"help\\" the compiler. RISC used the concept of register windows, in which the entire \\"register file\\" was broken down into blocks, allowing the compiler to \\"see\\" one block for global variables, and another for local variables. The idea was to make one particularly common instruction, the procedure call, extremely easy to implement. Almost all computer languages use a system known as an activation record or stack frame for each procedure which contains the address from which the procedure was called, the data (parameters) that were passed in, and space for any result values that need to be returned. In the vast majority of cases these frames are small, typically with three or fewer inputs and one or no outputs (and sometimes an input is reused as an output). In the Berkeley design, then, a register window was a set of several registers, enough of them that the entire procedure stack frame would most likely fit entirely within the register window. In this case, the call into and return from a procedure is simple and extremely fast. A single instruction is called to set up a new block of registers‚Äîa new register window‚Äîand then, with operands passed into the procedure in the \\"low end\\" of the new window, the program jumps into the procedure. On return, the results are placed in the window at the same end, and the procedure exits. The register windows are set up to overlap at the ends, so that the results from the call simply \\"appear\\" in the window of the caller, with no data having to be copied. Thus the common procedure call does not have to interact with main memory, greatly accelerating it. On the downside, this approach means that procedures with large numbers of local variables are problematic, and ones with fewer lead to registers‚Äîan expensive resource‚Äîbeing wasted. There are a finite number of register windows in the design, e.g. eight, so procedures can only be nested that many levels deep before the register windowing mechanism reaches its limit; once the last window is reached, no new window can be set up for another nested call. And if procedures are only nested a few levels deep, registers in the windows above the deepest call nesting level can never be accessed at all, so these are completely wasted. It was Stanford's work on compilers that led them to ignore the register window concept, believing that an efficient compiler could make better use of the registers than a fixed system in hardware. (The same reasoning would apply for a smart assembly- language programmer.) RISC I The first attempt to implement the RISC concept was originally known as Gold. Work on the design started in 1980 as part of a VLSI design course, but the then-complicated design crashed almost all existing design tools. The team had to spend considerable amounts of time improving or re-writing the tools, and even with these new tools it took just under an hour to extract the design on a VAX-11/780. The final design, known as RISC I, was published in ACM ISCA in 1981. It had 44,500 transistors implementing 31 instructions and a register file containing 78 32-bit registers. This allowed for six register windows containing 14 registers. Of those 14 registers, 4 were overlapped from the previous window. The total is then: 10*6 registers in windows + 18 globals = 78 registers total. The control and instruction decode section occupied only 6% of the die, whereas the typical design of the era used about 50% for the same role. The register file took up most of that space. RISC I also featured a two-stage instruction pipeline for additional speed, but without the complex instruction re-ordering of more modern designs. This makes conditional branches a problem, because the compiler has to fill the instruction following a conditional branch (the so- called \\"branch delay slot\\"), with something selected to be \\"safe\\" (i.e., not dependent on the outcome of the conditional). Sometimes the only suitable instruction in this case is \`NOP\`. A notable number of later RISC-style designs still require the consideration of branch delay. After a month of validation and debugging, the design was sent to the innovative MOSIS service for production on June 22, 1981, using a 2 Œºm (2,000 nm) process. A variety of delays forced them to abandon their masks four separate times, and wafers with working examples did not arrive back at Berkeley until May 1982. The first working RISC I \\"computer\\" (actually a checkout board) ran on June 11. In testing, the chips proved to have lesser performance than expected. In general, an instruction would take 2 Œºs to complete, while the original design allotted for about .4 ¬µs (five times as fast). The precise reasons for this problem were never fully explained. However, throughout testing it was clear that certain instructions did run at the expected speed, suggesting the problem was physical, not logical. Had the design worked at full speed, performance would have been excellent. Simulations using a variety of small programs compared the 4 MHz RISC I to the 5 MHz 32-bit VAX 11/780 and the 5 MHz 16-bit Zilog Z8000 showed this clearly. Program size was about 30% larger than the VAX but very close to that of the Z8000, validating the argument that the higher code density of CISC designs was not actually all that impressive in reality. In terms of overall performance, the RISC I was twice as fast as the VAX, and about four times that of the Z8000. The programs ended up performing about the same overall amount of memory access because the large register file dramatically improved the odds the needed operand was already on-chip. It is important to put this performance in context. Even though the RISC design had run slower than the VAX, it made no difference to the importance of the design. RISC allowed for the production of a true 32-bit processor on a real chip die using what was already an older fab. Traditional designs simply could not do this; with so much of the chip surface dedicated to decoder logic, a true 32-bit design like the Motorola 68020 required newer fabs before becoming practical. Using the same fabs, RISC I could have largely outperformed the competition. On February 12, 2015, IEEE installed a plaque at UC Berkeley to commemorate the contribution of RISC-I. The plaque reads: * UC Berkeley students designed and built the first VLSI reduced instruction-set computer in 1981. The simplified instructions of RISC-I reduced the hardware for instruction decode and control, which enabled a flat 32-bit address space, a large set of registers, and pipelined execution. A good match to C programs and the Unix operating system, RISC-I influenced instruction sets widely used today, including those for game consoles, smartphones and tablets. RISC II While the RISC I design ran into delays, work at Berkeley had already turned to the new Blue design. Work on Blue progressed slower than Gold, due both to the lack of a pressing need now that Gold was going to fab, as well as changeovers in the classes and students staffing the effort. This pace also allowed them to add in several new features that would end up improving the design considerably. The key difference was simpler cache circuitry that eliminated one line per bit (from three to two), dramatically shrinking the register file size. The change also required much tighter bus timing, but this was a small price to pay and in order to meet the needs several other parts of the design were sped up as well. The savings due to the new design were tremendous. Whereas Gold contained a total of 78 registers in 6 windows, Blue contained 138 registers broken into 8 windows of 16 registers each, with another 10 globals. This expansion of the register file increases the chance that a given procedure can fit all of its local storage in registers, as well as increasing the nesting depth. Nevertheless, the larger register file required fewer transistors, and the final Blue design, fabbed as RISC II, implemented all of the RISC instruction set with only 39,000 transistors. The other major change was to include an \\"instruction-format expander\\", which invisibly \\"up-converted\\" 16-bit instructions into a 32-bit format. This allowed smaller instructions, typically things with one or no operands, like \`NOP\`, to be stored in memory in a smaller 16-bit format, and for two such instructions to be packed into a single machine word. The instructions would be invisibly expanded back to 32-bit versions before they reached the ALU, meaning that no changes were needed in the core logic. This simple technique yielded a surprising 30% improvement in code density, making an otherwise identical program on Blue run faster than on Gold due to the decreased number of memory accesses. RISC II proved to be much more successful in silicon and in testing outperformed almost all minicomputers on almost all tasks. For instance, performance ranged from 85% of VAX speed to 256% on a variety of loads. RISC II was also benched against the famous Motorola 68000, then considered to be the best commercial chip implementation, and outperformed it by 140% to 420%. Follow-ons Work on the original RISC designs ended with RISC II, but the concept itself lived on at Berkeley. The basic core was re- used in SOAR in 1984, basically a RISC converted to run Smalltalk (in the same way that it could be claimed RISC ran C), and later in the similar VLSI-BAM that ran PROLOG instead of Smalltalk. Another effort was SPUR, which was a full set of chips needed to build a complete 32-bit workstation. RISC is less famous, but more influential, for being the basis of the commercial SPARC processor design from Sun Microsystems. It was the SPARC that first clearly demonstrated the power of the RISC concept; when they shipped in the first Sun-4s they outperformed anything on the market. This led to virtually every Unix vendor hurrying for a RISC design of their own, leading to designs like the DEC Alpha and PA-RISC, while SGI purchased MIPS Computer Systems. By 1986, most large chip vendors followed, working on efforts like the Motorola 88000, Fairchild Clipper, AMD 29000 and the PowerPC. On February 13, 2015, IEEE installed a plaque at Oracle Corporation in Santa Clara. It reads * Sun Microsystems introduced SPARC (Scalable Processor Architecture) RISC (Reduced Instruction-Set Computing) in 1987. Building upon UC Berkeley RISC and Sun compiler and operating system developments, SPARC architecture was highly adaptable to evolving semiconductor, software, and system technology and user needs. The architecture delivered the highest performance, scalable workstations and servers, for engineering, business, Internet, and cloud computing applications. Techniques developed for and alongside the idea of the reduced instruction set have also been adopted in successively more powerful implementations and extensions of the traditional \\"complex\\" x86 architecture. Much of a modern microprocessor's transistor count is devoted to large caches, many pipeline stages, superscalar instruction dispatch, branch prediction and other modern techniques which are applicable regardless of instruction architecture.

It made money early on by performing contract work for the National Institutes of Health, specifically in making modifications to the Macintosh so that it could be used by partially sighted or blind people. Several of these Access programs were licensed by Apple Computer and added to the operating system. Perhaps the most ambitious of these technologies was a program that could read the Macintosh screen, called outSPOKEN, which won a technology award from the Smithsonian in 1990. The first commercial success for Berkeley Systems was a virtual desktop product for the Macintosh called Stepping Out. Given the small size of the first Macintosh screens, this product had some use and the idea was widely copied. The much bigger success was After Dark, a modular screen saver that included flying toasters, and the first of its kind to be sold. The idea was brought to Berkeley Systems by Jack Eastman and Patrick Beard. Eastman was later put in charge of software development at Berkeley Systems. Berkeley Systems' best- selling product, the trivia game You Don't Know Jack, was developed by Jellyvision, based on their award-winning children's educational film \\"The Mind's Treasure Chest\\". You Don't Know Jack brought that program's model of interactive learning, engaging structure and pacing, and host character into the commercial mainstream. It also brought graphics, sound editing, and marketing to Berkeley; production of the show continued at Jellyvision's Chicago studios. They also made other lesser-known software titles, such as Launch Pad, a desktop replacement for kids, and Expresso Calendar and Address Book.Demos folder on After Dark 3.2 (Windows) installation CD Based in the old Pacific Bell building on Rose Street at Shattuck Avenue in Berkeley, California, Berkeley Systems grew to 120 employees and US$30 million annual revenue before it was acquired by the Sierra On-Line division of CUC International in 1997 for $13.8 million. Vivendi Universal‚Äôs subsequent acquisition of Sierra, and a host of similar enterprises, enjoined diverse competing sales and marketing departments with one sole directive: sell Web banner advertisements. As a result, Berkeley Systems became the U.S. headquarters of French-owned Flipside.com. In early 2000, Berkeley Systems was folded into the fledgling Los Angeles-based gambling site iWin.com, per the terms of that site's acquisition by Vivendi. The toasters were the subject of two lawsuits, the first in 1993, Berkeley Systems vs Delrina Corporation, over a module of Delrina's Opus 'N Bill screen saver in which Opus the Penguin shoots down the toasters. Delrina later changed the wings of the toasters to propellers in order to avoid infringing the trademark. The second case was brought in 1994 by the 1960s rock group Jefferson Airplane who claimed that the toasters were a copy of the winged toasters featured on the cover of their 1973 album Thirty Seconds Over Winterland. The case was dismissed, because the cover art had not been registered as a trademark by the group prior to Berkeley Systems' release of the screen saver.Another Poppin' Fresh Lawsuit By Lance Rose, Issue 2.10 (Oct 1994)wired.com Boyd and Blades went on to found the liberal political group MoveOn.org in 1998.

The centre was formerly known as Sandton Square and was named for the former President of South Africa and anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela in March 2004. A six meter high statue of Mandela was unveiled at the ceremony to rename the square. It is attached to the large Sandton City shopping centre, together forming one of the largest retail complexes on the continent with over 400 stores. The Michelangelo Towers complex adjoins Nelson Mandela Square. History The Square, then known by its original name of Sandton Square, was first opened to the public in 1994. The shopping centre was designed in a faux-Italian style and the square was designed to resemble St Marks Square in Venice. Its design included a library, theatre and gallery. On its 10th anniversary, in 2004, it was officially renamed Nelson Mandela Square after the unveiling of a Bronze, six- meter tall statue of Mandela. It was the first public statue of Mandela in the country. It was commissioned in July 2002 and completed in February 2004 by South African Sculptors Kobus Hattingh and Jacob Maponyane. It weighs approximately 2.5 tons. The decision to rename the Square after Mandela was criticized by some as Mandela had long stood for the disadvantaged and the square stands in the most opulent area of the country. Gary Vipond, the Square's manager, defended the decision by explaining that, \\"The Square is optimistic, expressive and confident, like the Madiba jive, and represents a sophisticated, eclectic, cosmopolitan success story.\\" The shopping centre is connected to Sandton City and, together, they form the largest retail complex in Africa. The square itself is approximately 1000m2 and houses many shops, restaurants and a library on the far end.

It was founded in 1136 by Cistercian monks at the request of King David I of Scotland and was the chief house of that order in the country until the Reformation. It was headed by the abbot or commendator of Melrose. Today the abbey is maintained by Historic Environment Scotland as a scheduled monument. The east end of the abbey was completed in 1146. Other buildings in the complex were added over the next 50 years. The abbey was built in the Gothic manner and in the form of a St. John's Cross. A considerable portion of the abbey is now in ruins. A structure dating from 1590 is maintained as a museum open to the public. Alexander II and other Scottish kings and nobles are buried at the abbey. A lead container believed to hold the embalmed heart of Robert the Bruce was found in 1921 below the Chapter House site; it was found again in a 1998 excavation. This was documented in records of his death. The rest of his body is buried in Dunfermline Abbey. The abbey is known for its many carved decorative details, including likenesses of saints, dragons, gargoyles and plants. On one of the abbey's stairways is an inscription by John Morow, a master mason, which says, Be halde to ye hende (\\"Keep in mind, the end, your salvation\\"). This has become the motto of the town of Melrose. History=Old Melrose An earlier monastery was founded by, then later dedicated to, Saint Aidan of Lindisfarne on a site about two miles (3 km) east of Melrose Abbey.\\"Melrose Abbey\\", BBC This was shortly before his death in 651 at Bamburgh. Set in a bend of the River Tweed, a graveyard marks the site. Saint Cuthbert, who grew up nearby, trained at Old Melrose abbey. He was prior from 662 before he moved to Lindisfarne (Holy Island). The visionary Dryhthelm was also a monk there in the early eighth century. The abbey site was raided by Kenneth I of Scotland in 839. Cistercian abbey William Miller, London. Facing P. 277. Melrose was the first Cistercian abbey in Scotland. King David I wanted the new abbey to be built on the same site, but the Cistercians insisted that the land was not good enough for farming and selected the current site. It was said to have been built in ten years. The church of the convent was dedicated to St. Mary (like all Cistercian houses) on 28 July 1146. The abbey became the mother church of the order in Scotland. Its first community came from Rievaulx, the Yorkshire house colonized from C√Æteaux.Barrett, Michael. \\"Abbey of Melrose.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 10. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 31 May 2016 In the 12th century, around Melrose, the Cistercians implemented new farming techniques and marketed Melrose wool throughout the great trading ports across northern Europe. A town slowly grew up around the abbey. During a time of famine four thousand starving people were fed by the monastery for three months. The monastery had 100 monks, exclusive of the abbot and dignitaries. The privileges and possessions of the abbey were very extensive. Its founder David endowed it with the lands of Melrose, Eildon, and other places; and the right of fishery on the River Tweed. Succeeding monarchs increased its property. The house was famed for its wealth, for many of its abbots were men of distinction and honour. Waltheof of Melrose, stepson of King David and at one time prior of Kirkham, was abbot of Melrose from 1148-1159. He endowed Melrose with a reputation for sanctity and learning which placed it on a par with houses such as Fountains and Rievaulx and made it the premier abbey in Scotland. The tomb of St. Waltheof, in the chapter house, later became the focus of pilgrimage.\\"Melrose\\", Cistercians in Yorkshire Project One of the earliest accounts of the settlement reached at Runnymede is found in the Chronicle of Melrose Abbey.\\"Verse account of Magna Carta in the Chronicle of Melrose Abbey\\", British Library Melrose was located on one of the main roads running from Edinburgh to the south making it particularly vulnerable to attack. In 1322, the town was attacked by the army of Edward II, and much of the abbey was destroyed. It was rebuilt by order of King Robert the Bruce, with Sir James Douglas being principal auditor of finance for the project.26 March 1325-The Records of the Parliaments of Scotland to 1707 ([www.rps.ac.uk]), K.M. Brown et al eds (St Andrews, 2007-2011). In 1385, the abbey was burned by the army of Richard II of England, \\"partly because of support for the Avignon Pope Clement VII\\"Green, David. The Hundred Years War: A People's History. p. 81. Yale University Press, 2014. . he forced the army of Robert II of Scotland back to Edinburgh. It was rebuilt over a period of about 100 years--construction was still unfinished when James IV visited in 1504. From 1541, the abbacy was held by a series of commendators. In 1544, as English armies raged across Scotland in an effort to force the Scots to allow the infant Mary, Queen of Scots to marry the son of Henry VIII, the abbey was again badly damaged and was never fully repaired. This led to its decline as a working monastery. The last abbot was James Stuart (the illegitimate son of James V), who died in 1559. In 1590, Melrose's last monk died. The abbey withstood one final assault, and some of its walls still show the marks of cannon fire after having been bombarded by Oliver Cromwell's troops during the English Civil War. In 1618, a portion of the abbey's church was converted into a parish church for the surrounding town. A plain vault was inserted into the crossing, removing the original ribbed vaulting in the central section. It was used until 1810 when a new church was erected in the town. In 1812, a stone coffin was exhumed from the aisle in the abbey's south chancel. Some speculated the remains were those of Michael Scot, the philosopher and \\"wizard.\\" At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Sir Walter Scott was appointed Sheriff-Depute of Roxburghshire. In 1822, with the financial assistance of the Duke of Buccleuch, Sir Walter supervised the extensive repair work that was to preserve the ruins. In 1918, the duke gave the ruins to the state, by which time the abbey had undergone further restoration and repair. It is now in the care of Historic Environment Scotland. Robert the Bruce Modern marker for the site of the burial of the heart of Robert the Bruce at Melrose Abbey Robert the Bruce's heart is said to have been buried in the church, perhaps brought back from a crusade with the body of Lord Douglas in either 1330 or 1331. The position was marked by a small metal plaque. In 1996, an archaeological excavation on the site unearthed a conical lead container and an engraved copper plaque that read \\"The enclosed leaden casket containing a heart was found beneath Chapter House floor, March 1921, by His Majesty's Office of Works.\\" The casket was investigated by AOC archaeology in Leith and contained a still recognisable human heart in a thick black liquor. As there are no records of anyone else's heart being buried at Melrose it was presumed to be that of Robert the Bruce. The container was reburied at Melrose Abbey on 22 June 1998 under a memorial stone. There is no way to prove conclusively whether the heart belonged to King Robert. There is no record of any other heart being buried on the site; however, the Chapter House would be an unusual location for a king's heart to be buried: most high-status burials would have happened next to the altar. Description Ground plan of Melrose Abbey The abbey is laid out on a traditional east-west axis. The west section is almost wholly absent other than its foundations. The eastern section is more intact. A graveyard serving the local community lies to the south and south-east of the abbey. The majority of stones date from the 19th century. The abbey is the only Scottish abbey to still retain some of its original floor tiles.Scottish Border Abbeys: HMSO official guide SBN 11 490969 5 The northern cloisters are equally erased to foundation level.

Clockwise from top: 9th-century Kashmir, 13th-century Karnataka, 9th century Prambanan Indonesia, 2nd-century Uttar Pradesh. The Devi Mahatmya or Devi Mahatmyam (Sanskrit: ', ), or \\"Glory of the Goddess\\") is a Hindu religious text describing the Goddess as the supreme power and creator of the universe. It is part of the Markandeya Purana, and estimated to have been composed in Sanskrit between 400-600 CE. Devi Mahatmyam is also known as the DurgƒÅ Saptashatƒ´ () or (). The text contains 700 verses arranged into 13 chapters. Along with Devi-Bhagavata Purana and Shakta Upanishads such as the Devi Upanishad, it is one of the most important texts of Shaktism (goddess) tradition within Hinduism. The Devi Mahatmyam describes a storied battle between good and evil, where the Devi manifesting as goddess Durga leads the forces of good against the demon Mahishasura‚Äîthe goddess is very angry and ruthless, and the forces of good win. In peaceful prosperous times, states the text, the Devi manifests as Lakshmi, empowering wealth creation and happiness. The verses of this story also outline a philosophical foundation wherein the ultimate reality (Brahman in Hinduism) is female. The text is one of the earliest extant complete manuscripts from the Hindu traditions which describes reverence and worship of the feminine aspect of God. The Devi Mahatmya is often ranked in some Hindu traditions to be as important as the Bhagavad Gita. The Devi Mahatmya has been particularly popular in eastern states of India, such as West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha, Assam, Goa as well as Nepal. It is recited during Navratri celebrations, the Durga Puja festival, and in Durga temples across India. Etymology The oldest surviving manuscript of the Devi MƒÅhƒÅtmya, on palm-leaf, in an early Bhujimol script, Bihar or Nepal, 11th century. Sanskrit , \\"magnanimity, highmindedness, majesty\\" is a neuter abstract noun of ', or \\"great soul.\\" The title ' is a tatpurusha compound, literally translating to \\"the magnanimity of the goddess.\\" The text is called Sapta≈õati (literally a collection of seven hundred\\" or something that contains seven hundreds in number), as it contains 700 shlokas (verses). ' or ' is the name by which the Supreme Goddess is referred to in Devƒ´ MƒÅhƒÅtmya. According to Hindu Scriptures, \\"' is \\"the Goddess of Truth and Justice who came to Earth for the establishment of Dharma ,\\" from the adjective ', \\"fierce, violent, cruel for evil forces not for good forces .\\" The epithet has no precedent in Vedic literature and is first found in a late insertion to the Mahabharata, where ' and ' appear as epithets.\\"Coburn, Thomas B., Devƒ´ MƒÅhƒÅtmya. p 95  History  Durga temple depicting scenes from Devi Mahatmya, in Aihole temple, is part of a UNESCO world heritage site candidate. The Devi Mahatmya, states C. Mackenzie Brown, is both a culmination of centuries of Indian ideas about the divine feminine, as well as a foundation for the literature and spirituality focussed on the feminine transcendence in centuries that followed. One of the earliest evidence of reverence for the feminine aspect of God appears in chapter 10.125 of the Rig Veda, also called Devƒ´s≈´kta. Hymns to goddesses are in the ancient Hindu epic Mahabharata, particularly in the later (100 to 300 CE) added Harivamsa section of it. The archaeological and textual evidence implies, states Thomas Coburn, that the Goddess had become as much a part of the Hindu tradition, as God, by about the third or fourth century. Date Devi Mahatmya is a text extracted from Markandeya Purana, and constitutes the latter's chapters 81 through 93. The Purana is dated to the ~3rd century CE, and the Devi Mahatmya was added to the Markandeya Purana either in the 5th or 6th century. The Dadhimati Mata inscription (608 CE) quotes a portion from the Devi Mahatmya. Thus, it can be concluded that the text was composed before the 7th century CE. It is generally dated between 400-600 CE. Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty dates the Devi Mahatmya to c. 550 CE, and rest of the Markandeya Purana to c. 250 CE. Philosophy The Devi Mahatmya text is a devotional text, and its aim, states Thomas Coburn, is not to analyze divine forms or abstract ideas, but to praise. This it accomplishes with a philosophical foundation, wherein the female is the primordial creator; she is also the Tridevi as the secondary creator, the sustainer, and destroyer. She is presented, through a language of praise, as the one who dwells in all creatures, as the soul, as the power to know, the power to will and the power to act. She is consciousness of all living beings, she is intelligence, she is matter, and she is all that is form or emotion. The text includes hymns to saguna (manifest, incarnated) form of the Goddess, as well as nirguna (unmanifest, abstract) form of her. The saguna hymns appear in chapters 1, 4 and 11 of the Devi Mahatmya, while chapter 5 praises the nirguna concept of Goddess. The saguna forms of her, asserts the text, are Mahakali (destroyer, Tamasic, Desire principle of mother), Mahalakshmi (sustainer, evolution principle of mother ,Sattvic) and Mahasaraswati (creator, Action principle of mother , Rajasvic ), which as a collective are called Tridevi. The nirguna concept (Avyakrita, transcendent) is also referred to as Maha- lakshmi. This structure is not accidental, but embeds the Samkhya philosophy idea of three Gunas that is central in Hindu scriptures such as the Bhagavad Gita. The Samkhya philosophical premise asserts that all life and matter has all three co-existent innate tendencies or attributes (Gu·πáa), whose equilibrium or disequilibrium drives the nature of a living being or thing.James G. Lochtefeld, Guna, in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M, Vol. 1, Rosen Publishing, , page 265Alban Widgery (1930), The principles of Hindu Ethics, International Journal of Ethics, Vol. 40, No. 2, pages 234-237 Tamasic is darkness and destructiveness (represented as Kali in Devi Mahatmya), Sattvic is light and creative pursuit (Mahalakshmi), and Rajasic is dynamic energy qua energy without any intent of being creative or destructive (Mahasaraswati). The unmanifest, in this philosophy, has all these three innate attributes and qualities, as potent principle within, as unrealized power, and this unrealized Goddess dwells in every individual, according to Devi Mahatmya. This acknowledgment of Samkhya dualistic foundation is then integrated into a monistic (non-dualistic, Advaita) spirituality in Devi Mahatmya, just like the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, the Bhagavata Purana and other important texts of Hinduism. Contents The Devƒ´ MƒÅhƒÅtmya consists of chapters 81-93 of the MƒÅrkandeya Purana, one of the early Sanskrit Puranas, which is a set of stories being related by the sage Markandeya to Jaimini and his students (who are in the form of birds). The thirteen chapters of Devi MƒÅhƒÅtmya are divided into three charitas or episodes. At the beginning of each episode a different presiding goddess is invoked, none of whom is mentioned in the text itself.Coburn, Thomas B., Encountering the Goddess. p 100 The framing narrative of Devi Mahatmya presents a dispossessed king, a merchant betrayed by his family, and a sage whose teachings lead them both beyond existential suffering. The sage instructs by recounting three different epic battles between the Devi and various demonic adversaries (the three tales being governed by the three Tridevi, respectively, Mahakali (Chapter 1), Mahalakshmi (Chapters 2-4), and Mahasaraswati (Chapters 5-13). Most famous is the story of Mahishasura Mardini ‚Äì Devi as \\"Slayer of the Buffalo Demon\\" ‚Äì one of the most ubiquitous images in Hindu art and sculpture, and a tale known almost universally in India. Among the important goddess forms the Devi Mahatmyam introduced into the Sanskritic mainstream are Kali and the Sapta-Matrika (\\"Seven Mothers\\").Kali, Davadatta, p. xvii First episode Vishnu vanishes Madhu-Kaitabha, with Devi in the background. The first story of the Devi Mahatmya depicts Devi in her form as Mahakali. Here Devi is central and key to the creation; she is the power that induces Narayana's deep slumber on the waters of the cosmic ocean prior to the manifestation of the Universe which is a continuous cycle of manifestation, destruction and re-manifestation. Vishnu manifests from all pervading Narayan and goes into deep slumber on Adi Sesha. Two demons, Madhu-Kaitabh, arise as thoughtforms from Vishnu's sleeping body and endeavour to vanquish Brahma who is preparing to create the next cycle of the Universe. Brahma sings to the Great Goddess, asking her to withdraw from Vishnu so he may awaken and slay the demons. Devi agrees to withdraw and Vishnu awakens and vanquishes the demons. Here Devi serves as the agent who allows the cosmic order to be restored. Middle episode The middle episode presents goddess Mahalakshmi in the avatar of Durga. She is a great Warrior Goddess, representing divine anger and the lethal energy against evil. The episode stages a world under attack by a form-shifting Mahishasura, an evil demon who uses deception to disarm his opponents, ultimately taking the form of a buffalo demon. He defeats the male gods individually, who fear total annihilation of the forces of good. They team up, combine their individual strengths and channel it into endowed Durga. Riding a lion into battle, Durga captures and slays the buffalo demon, by cutting off its head. She then destroys the inner essence of the demon when it emerges from the buffalo's severed neck, thereby establishing order in the world. In the theological practices of the goddess tradition of Hinduism, the middle episode is the most important. If a community or individual cannot recite the entire Devi Mahatmya composition, the middle episode alone is recited at a puja or festival. Further, when the recital begins, the tradition is to complete the reading of the middle episode completely as a partial reading is considered to create a spiritual chidra or \\"chink in the armor\\". Final episode Vaishnavi, Kaumari, Maheshvari, Brahmani. (bottom row, from left) Varahi, Aindri and Chamunda or Kali against the demon Raktabija. A Folio from the Devi Mahatmya. The final episode depicts Devi in her form of Mahasaraswati.She is portrayed as arising from the cells or koshas of Devi Saraswati and hence she is named as Devi Kaushiki. Kali may be understood to represent or \\"aspect\\" the darker, chthonic, transformative qualities of Devi's power or Shakti. Kali's emergence is chronicled in the third story of the Devi Mahatmya. Kali,in the form of Chamunda emerges from Devi's eyebrows as a burst of psychic energy. Kali overpowers and beheads Chanda and Munda, and when she delivers their severed heads to Devi, she is dubbed Chamunda. During a fierce battle in which the Great Goddess demonstrates her omnipotence by defeating powerful demons who terrify the devas, she encounters the fierce Raktabija (chapter 8). Every drop of blood Raktabija sheds transforms into another demon as it touches the earth. A unique strategy has to be devised to vanquish him. A fiery burst of energy emerging from Devi's third eye takes the dark skeletal form of goddess Kali. With her huge mouth and enormous tongue she ferociously laps up Raktabija's blood, thus preventing the uprising of further demons. The story continues in which Devi, Kali and a group of Matrikas destroy the demonic brothers Sumbha (chapter 10) and Nisumbha (chapter 9). In the final battle against Shumbha, Devi absorbs Kali and the matrikas and stands alone for the final battle. Symbolism of the three episodes Devadatta Kali states that the three tales are \\"allegories of outer and inner experience\\". The evil adversaries of the Goddess, states Kali, symbolize the all-too-human impulses, such as pursuit of power, or possessions, or delusions such as arrogance. The Goddess wages war against this. Like the philosophical and symbolic battlefield of the Bhagavad Gita, the Devi Mahatmya symbolic killing grounds target human frailties, according to Kali, and the Goddess targets the demons of ego and dispels our mistaken idea of who we are. Most hymns, states Thomas Coburn, present the Goddess's martial exploits, but these are \\"surpassed by verses of another genre, viz., the hymns to the Goddess\\". The hymnic portion of the text balances the verses that present the spiritual liberation power of the Goddess.Coburn, Thomas B., Devƒ´ MƒÅhƒÅtmya. p 72 These hymns describe the nature and character of the Goddess in spiritual terms: # Brahma-stuti (part 1 start), # Sakradi-stuti (part 2 end), # The \\"Ya Devi\\" Hymn (part 3 start), # Narayani-stuti (part 3 end). Angas (Appendages) A 17th-century Devimahatmya manuscript. As an independent text, Devƒ´ MƒÅhƒÅtmya has acquired a number of \\"limbs\\" or \\"subsidiary texts\\" or \\"appendages\\" (angas) over the years \\"fore and aft\\". According to Coburn \\"artistic evidence suggests that the angas have been associated with the text since the fourteenth century.\\" The angas are chiefly concerned with the ritual use of Devƒ´ MƒÅhƒÅtmya and based on the assumption that the text will be recited aloud in the presence of images.Coburn, Thomas B., Encountering the Goddess.p 100‚Äì101 There are two different traditions in the Anga parayana. One is the trayanga parayana (Kavacha, Argala, Keelaka). The other is the Navanga parayana (Nyasam, Avahanam, Namani, Argalam, Keelakam, Hrudayam, Dhalam, Dhyanam, Kavacham). The navanga format is followed in kerala and some other parts in South India. Preceding subsidiary texts *Durga Saptasloki also known as \\"Amba Stuti\\" - They are introduced as one-verse query from Siva who asks about the means of achieving what is desired, and a one verse response from the Goddess who says she will proclaim the relevant discipline (sadhana) by revealing Amba Stuti which consists of the seven verses indicated.Coburn, Thomas B., Encountering the Goddess.p 223 *Devi-kavacham - The Devi Kavacham consisting of 61 Slokas is in Markandeya Purana. This Kavacham (armour) protects the reader in all parts of his body, in all places and in all difficulties.Swami Sivananda, p 3 *Argala-stotram - Here Rishi Markandeya is telling his disciples in 27 inspiring couplets on the greatness of Devi. She has been described in all aspects and names and at the end of each Sloka, prayer is offered to Devi for material prosperity, physical fitness, fame and victory. *Keelakam - Here also Rishi Markandeya tells his disciples in 16 Slokas, the ways and means of removing obstacles faced by devotees, while reading Devi Mahatmya. *Ratri Suktam (Vedic) - Ratri Suktam (8 Slokas) has been taken from Rig Veda, 10th Mandala, 10th Anuvaka, 127th Sukta, which shows that Devi was worshipped from time immemorial. Devi is described as the all-pervading Supreme Lord of the Universe appearing in Omkara. Here Ratri is the Goddess who fulfills our prayers. *Kunjika Stotram is also a beautiful hymn written in the saptashati which is said to be the mixture of the three hymns i.e., Kavacham, Argala stotram, Keelakam and also Rahasya parvam (Murthy Rahasyam and Vaikrutika Rahasyam).It is said that Lord Shiva had recited this shloka to Parvathi at her attainment of BramhaGyaan. This shloka plays an important role in Devi Saptashati. It is at the ending of the book. *Ratri Suktam (Tantrik) - The hymn in the first chapter is the Tantrik Ratri Sukta.Swami Satyananda Saraswati, Either the Ratri Suktam (Vedic) or Ratri Suktam (Tantrik) is read depending upon whether the ritual is Vaidic or Tantrik. One of the texts recited by some traditions is the (). Succeeding subsidiary texts *Pradhana Rahasyam - \\"Deals with the process of creation. It is the secret about mula Prakrti who is the cause of creation.\\"Sankaranarayanan. S., p 271‚Äì273 *Vaikritika Rahasyam - \\"Describes how the Godhead beyond change subjected itself to change, how the mula prakrti (productive), became vikriti (produced); hence the name Vaikritika Rahasyam.\\" *Murti Rahasyam - \\"The incarnations, the Avatar murtis of the Goddess are mentioned.\\" *Devi Suktam (Rig Vedoktam) - (According to Rig Veda): \\"The 8 Slokas composed by Vak, the daughter of Maharshi Ambharin, are from the Rig Veda, 10th Mandala, 10th Anuvaka, 125th Sukta. These Slokas express the truth realised by Vak, who identifies herself as Brahma Sakti, and expresses herself as 11 Rudras, 8 Vasus, 12 Adityas and all the Devas,‚Äî Indra, Agni and Asvini Kumaras‚Äîwho are sustained by Her and She is the source, substratum and support of the whole world. She is verily Brahmasvarupini (embodiment of Brahman).\\" *Devi Suktam (Tantrik) - The hymn in chapter 5 is Tantrik Devi Suktam. The number and order of these depend on the Sampradaya (tradition).Sarma, Sarayu Prasad, Saptashatƒ´ SarvasvamSri Durga Saptashatƒ´, Gita Press Either the Devi Suktam (Vedic) or Devi Suktam (Tantrik) is read depending upon whether the ritual is Vedic or Tantrik. At the end of a traditional recitation of the text, a prayer craving pardon from the Goddess known as Aparadha Kshmapana Stotram is recited. Significance The Devi Mahatmya was considered significant among the Puranas by Indologists. This is indicated by the early dates when it was translated into European languages. It was translated into English in 1823, followed by an analysis with excerpts in French in 1824. It was translated into Latin in 1831 and Greek in 1853.Coburn, Thomas B., Devƒ´ MƒÅhƒÅtmya. p 52 Devi Mahatmya has been translated into most of the Indian languages. There are also a number of commentaries and ritual manuals. The commentaries and ritual manual followed vary from region to region depending on the tradition. Place in the Hindu canon Mahishasura Mardini, Slayer of the Buffalo Demon ‚Äî a central episode of the Devi Mahatmya Devi MƒÅhƒÅtmyam has been called the Testament of Shakta philosophy.Manna, Sibendu, p 92 It is the base and root of Shakta doctrine.Swami Sivananda p 5 It appears as the centre of the great Shakti tradition of Hinduism. It is in Devi Mahatmya, states C Mackenzie Brown, that \\"the various mythic, cultic and theological elements relating to diverse female divinities were brought together in what has been called the 'crystallization of the Goddess tradition.\\" The unique feature of Devi MƒÅhƒÅtmyam is the oral tradition. Though it is part of the devotional tradition, it is in the rites of the Hindus that it plays an important role. The entire text is considered as one single Mantra and a collection of 700 Mantras. The Devi MƒÅhƒÅtmyam is treated in the cultic context as if it were a Vedic hymn or verse with sage (), meter, pradhnadevata, and viniyoga (for japa). It has been approached, by Hindus and Western scholars, as scripture in and by itself, where its significance is intrinsic, not derived from its Puranic context.Coburn, Thomas B., Devƒ´ MƒÅhƒÅtmya. p 51‚Äì55 According to Damara Tantra \\"Like Aswamedha in Yagnas, Hari in Devas, Sapthsati is in hymns.\\" \\"Like the Vedas; Saptasati is eternal\\" says Bhuvaneshwari Samhita.Anna, p vii There are many commentaries on Devi MƒÅhƒÅtmya. * Guptavati by Bhaskararaya * Nagesi by Nagoji Bhat * Santhanavi * Puspanjali * Ramashrami * Dhamsoddharam * Durgapradeepam are some of them.Anna, p v The significance of Devi MƒÅhƒÅtmya has been explained in many Tantric and Puranic texts like Katyayani Tantra, Gataka Tantra, Krodha Tantra, Meru Tantram, Marisa Kalpam, Rudra Yamala, and Chidambara Rahasya. A number of studies of Shaktism appreciate the seminal role of Devi MƒÅhƒÅtmya in the development of the Shakta tradition. In popular tradition Recitation of Durga Mahatmya on Mahalaya marks the formal beginning of the Durga Puja festival The recitation of Devi Mahatmya is done during the Sharad Navaratri (Oct. - Nov.) in India. It is recited during Navratri celebrations, the Durga Puja festival and in Durga temples of India. The text is also recited during the Vasantha Navaratri (March - April) in Uttarakhand, Jammu, Himachal Pradesh and other states of north India. It is also chanted during special occasions like temple kumbabhishekam and as a general parihara. In Popular Culture *Colors TV launched a mythological series named Jai Jag Janani Maa Durga in 2012 based on Devi Mahatmya. *Colors TV launched a mythological series named Mahakali ‚Äî Anth Hi Aarambh Hai in 2017 based on Devi Mahatmya. *Sony Entertainment Television launched a mythological series named Vighnaharata Ganesha in 2017 which also portrayed episodes from this text. *Dangal TV launched a mythological series named Devi Adi Parashakti in 2020 which is also based on Devi Mahatmya.

Life Combe was born in Edinburgh on 27 October 1797, the son of George Combe (1745-1816), a brewer, and was a younger brother of George Combe. After some years at the Royal High School, he became a surgeon's pupil in 1812, residing during most of the time with his elder brother George Combe, and obtaining his diploma at Surgeons' Hall on 2 February 1817. In October 1817, he went to Paris to complete his medical studies, specializing in anatomy and investigating cerebral morphology under Spurzheim's supervision in 1818‚Äì19. After a visit to Switzerland, he returned to Edinburgh in 1819, intending to start a practice there. However, illness compelled him to spend the next two winters in the south of France and Italy. In 1823, he began to practise in Edinburgh. He had already made contributions to the newly established Edinburgh Phrenological Society. The first to be published was On the Effects of Injuries of the Brain upon the Manifestations of the Mind, read on 9 January 1823. In the same year he also answered Dr. Barclay's attack on phrenology in his Life and Organisation. Combe's essay was so clearly written that a subsequent opponent of phrenology alluded to its \\"satanic logic\\". In 1823, Combe joined his brother and others in establishing the Phrenological Journal, following a debate at the Royal Medical Society in which he felt he had scored a major victory over the opponents of phrenology, but of which the Society declined to publish any account. This memorable discussion, inspired by one of Andrew Combe's essays, took place at the Royal Medical Society on 21 and 25 November 1823, and lasted till nearly four in the morning. The essay was published in the Phrenological Journal (vol 1, p. 337); but records of the discussion were suppressed by means of an injunction obtained by the Medical Society from the Court of Session. In 1825, Combe graduated M.D. at Edinburgh. His practice grew quickly because of Combe's personal qualities ‚Äì his ability to listen, and his exceptional professional courtesy. In 1827, he was elected President of the Edinburgh Phrenological Society. Combe had been consulted in many cases of insanity and nervous disease, and on 6 February 1830 wrote an article in The Scotsman commenting unfavourably on the verdict of the jury in the Davies case in 1829. The doctors who had declared Davies insane were proved by the event to be quite right. Encouraged by this success, in 1831, Combe published his Observations on Mental Derangement, which was very successful. Ill health forced Combe to spend the winter of 1831‚Äì2 abroad, but he recovered sufficiently to begin writing his work on Physiology applied to Health and Education. This was published in 1834 and was a bestseller. In the early 1830s Combe's address is listed as 25 Northumberland Street in the fashionable New Town of Edinburgh. His brother George Combe is listed as living at the same address. The house was purchased from John Gibson Lockhart (Sir Walter Scott's biographer and son-in-law) in 1825. In 1834, Combe applied for the post of superintendent of the Montrose asylum ‚Äì the first publicly funded post in mental hospital practice in Scotland ‚Äì but, on receiving a request for a reference from William A. F. Browne ‚Äì Combe withdrew his application and warmly endorsed his former student. Browne was successful in his application, and was celebrated at Montrose as an outstanding superintendent. However, in his hugely influential lectures on asylum management, delivered in the Autumn of 1836, Browne did not mention phrenological thinking, and Combe had to await a delayed expression of gratitude in the dedication of Browne's lectures ‚Äì What Asylums Were, Are, and Ought to Be ‚Äì which were published to international acclaim in 1837. Combe's health permitted him to resume practice to only a limited extent in 1833-5. Early in 1836 he received the appointment of physician to King Leopold I of Belgium (with Dr. James Clark's recommendation) and moved to Brussels; but his health again failed, and he returned to Edinburgh in the same year. He soon completed and published his Physiology of Digestion (1836), which reached a ninth edition in 1849. A very considerable practice now absorbed all his energies, and in 1838 he was appointed a physician to Queen Victoria. In 1840, he published his last, and he considered his best book, The Physiological and Moral Management of Infancy. The sixth edition appeared in 1847. During his later years, tuberculosis made serious advances. Two winters in Madeira and a voyage to the United States failed to improve things, and he died while on a visit to a nephew at Gorgie Mills, on the south-west side of Edinburgh, on 9 August 1847. Combe never married. He is buried with his grandfather, George Combe, brewer (died 1816) in St Cuthberts Churchyard. The grave is located on the south side of the \\"Bairn's Knowe\\" behind the older stones, and backing onto the former church halls. His biography, written by his brother, was published in 1850. Criticism of vegetarianism Combe criticized vegetarianism and the dieting ideas of William Alcott and Sylvester Graham. In his book The Physiology of Digestion he commented that \\"the arguments of Mr Graham and Dr Alcott in favour of exclusive vegetable diet, are not based on sound physiological principles, and the broad assertions which they make of the superior strength of vegetable-eating savages in comparison with civilised Europeans, rest on insufficient evidence, and are not supported by the experience of trustworthy observers.\\"Combe, Andrew. (1860). The Physiology of Digestion. Edinburgh: Maclachan & Stewart. pp. 145-146 Combe denied that Isaac Newton was a strict vegetarian and noted that \\"he did not usually confine himself to a vegetable diet.\\"Lawrence, Christopher; Shapin, Steven.

The cathedral site has been home to a church for over a thousand years and the first stone church was built there in Norman times. History With the creation of the Diocese of Blackburn in 1926 (taken from the Diocese of Manchester) the impressive parish church of St Mary the Virgin was raised to cathedral status. The church, which was built in 1826 and designed by architect John Palmer, now forms the cathedral's nave. It replaced the parish church that was demolished in 1819‚Äì1820. In the early 1930s, fundraising began to enlarge the cathedral so that the building complemented its newfound importance. By 1938, enough money had been raised and work began on enlarging the new cathedral. Although work was interrupted by the war, it was resumed afterwards and continued through the 1950s and into the early 1960s. After the death of architect W.A. Forsyth in 1950, architect Laurence King joined the project and designed the distinctive lantern tower. The lantern tower, which consists of 56 different panes of coloured glass, with a modernist slender aluminium spire, was completed in 1967. The cathedral was finally completed in 1977 and what had been built over the past decades was finally consecrated as Blackburn Cathedral that year. The North transept contains eight misericords dating from the 15th century. It is not known at what time they arrived at the Cathedral, but they are believed to have originated at Whalley Abbey. This could mean that they were removed to a builder's yard after the Dissolution, but with the cathedral not being built until the 19th century, this allows for the possibility that they had lain unused for some 300 years. On 17 April 2014 the Cathedral hosted the Royal Maundy service. In keeping with tradition, Elizabeth II handed out Maundy money to 88 men and 88 women. It was the Queen's first visit to the Cathedral.

On Sundays the Parish Communion is sung by the YPC and the Eucharist and Evensong by the Cathedral Choir. Organ A scheme for an organ in the west gallery was submitted, by John Gray and partner Frederick Davison, two years before the consecration of the new church. The organ was opened on 28 February 1828 with a concert which included works by Handel - extracts from his Messiah and Israel in Egypt and his Occasional Overture played by the new organist Joseph John Harris. Blackburn Cathedral is blessed with a world-class Organ, built by JW Walker and rebuilt by Wood of Huddersfield. This is not only showcased to great effect through its use as an inspirational liturgical instrument, but also through the many recordings that have been made and in the regular lunchtime concerts and organ meditations that have taken place throughout the year.http://www.blackburncathedral.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/The-Organs- of-Blackburn-Cathedral.pdf Organists Since 2019 the organist and director of music has been John Robinson. Previous organists have included Richard Henry Coleman, Charles Hylton Stewart, Herman Brearley, Thomas Lucas Duerden, John Bertalot, David Anthony Cooper, Gordon Stewart and Richard Tanner. Recent developments In 1998 the lantern tower underwent restoration, being rebuilt in natural stone. The original 1960s tower had been constructed in concrete. The windows were also replaced. Further work was carried out in 2000‚Äì01 to re-build the east end roofs and parapets and blend them into the existing structures. Upon completion of this work the cathedral was finally deemed to be finished after over 70 years of construction. As well as this rebuilding a new piece of art was commissioned for the exterior of the building. The sculpture by Mark Jalland, The Healing of The Nations, measuring , is an abstract steel and copper circular piece containing thousands of interwoven fibre optics that create ever-changing patterns of light at night. It is deemed by many to be one of the most innovative pieces of modern sculpture at any English cathedral. In 2009 the flagpole on the tower was renewed and topped with an ornate bishop's mitre finial painted and gilded in gold leaf by Mark Bridges of Sussex and bearing the Lancashire Rose emblem\\"New ornate mitre tops off tower at Blackburn Cathedral\\" at ancashiretelegraph.co.uk/ The cathedral still forms an important part of the community. It is open to visitors and has a gift shop and caf√© as well as hosting numerous events. In February 2011 the Cathedral exhibited the Quaker Tapestry from Kendal.

The company produced the BBS door games Legend of the Red Dragon, Planets: The Exploration of Space and Growtopia, an experimental multiplayer creative sandbox created as a collaboration with Hamumu Software, released in 2013 for iOS, Android, Microsoft Windows, and macOS. History=The BBS era In 1989, Seth Robinson created a game that he called Legend of the Red Dragon, or LORD, in an effort to attract new users to his Amiga-based BBS that he ran at the time. He was only 14 years old at the time. He later allowed others to port the game to other operating systems and BBS platforms. The game exemplified how simple a game could be while still being fun. It is a text-based menu-driven fighting game, allowing players to take on the role of a potential dragon-slayer. It featured multiplayer options if its BBS host had multiple nodes (or phone lines). The gameplay style that it featured was in many ways a predecessor to the MMORPG genre. The game would later feature a form of graphical menus, created and displayed by RIPTerm. Another feature of the game was In Game Modules or IGMs. These were little add-ons to the game, allowing for expansion. IGMs could be written by anyone and allowed for a lot of gameplay to be added on. Some IGMs even allowed \\"mischievous\\" game play, almost allowing players to cheat. Robinson only released a single IGM of his own, called Barak's House. Shortly afterwards, Robinson released a game called Planets: The Exploration of Space. Commonly referred to as Planets: TEOS, it was a space trading game that had players flying to various kinds of planets, buying, selling, and trading items in order to make money. The game allowed fights that were very similar in style to LORD, allowing players to attack others when they were offline. Players could also attack planets in order to take control of them. Robinson describes the game as \\"kind of like LORD mixed with Tradewars\\". The game featured two sides, the Alliance and the Maraken. Players could join and fight for either side. Players could own planets for whichever side they belonged to. However, they could also play independently and start their own \\"guilds\\" called cartels. The game had a notable Star Trek influence, including references to the Borg and characters from different Star Trek shows. Planets: TEOS also featured IGMs, the major difference being that players had to travel to a particular planet to enter into that IGM. Robinson only released one TEOS IGM of his own, called \\"Landfill\\", which was a Tetris clone. In various releases of Planets: TEOS, Robinson advertised a new game he had been working on. This game, New World, would never see release due to reasons that were never made public. Instead, another of Robinson's games inherited the name, Legend of the Red Dragon II: New World. Fans wanted a new game from Robinson and wanted New World as well, so he released the official sequel to his original hit, Legend of the Red Dragon. This game is completely different than the original Red Dragon. Instead of a text-based menu concept, the game had an ANSI-based graphical map concept. Players controlled a smiley face-like character that could roam around, much like modern MMORPGs. The game was never as successful as the original Red Dragon, but it did gather a cult following. Eventually, Robinson sold the rights to the three BBS games to Metropolis Gameport in 1998. =List of RTSoft BBS Door games and programs= * Legend of the Red Dragon ** Barak's House (a LORD IGM) * Planets: The Exploration of Space (or simply Planets: TEOS) ** Landfill (TEOS In Game Module Tetris clone) * Legend of the Red Dragon II: New World * RTReader (BBS door that ran from a scripting language) * BradyBunch Adventure (multiplayer .DLL for MBBS/Worldgroup) * Tournament LORD (MBBS/Worldgroup .DLL port) The PC era In 1997, Robinson Technologies released an adventure/RPG title by the name of Dink Smallwood. This was an effort made by Seth Robinson to move away from BBS door games and into something more profitable. The title featured an isometric view and had a comedic focus. In an attempt to keep the game's player-base active longer, Robinson took the idea of IGMs from Legend of the Red Dragon and created \\"D-Mods\\", an add-on feature where players could create their own adventure for others to explore. Anyone could create D-Mods and distribute them as they wished. On 17 October 1999, Robinson Technologies released the game to the public for free, and now it can be downloaded without charge from their website.

Originally based at Bembridge Airport on the Isle of Wight, Cushioncraft later moved to the Duver Works at St. Helens, these works gave ready access to the sheltered water of Bembridge Harbour. History In 1960 Britten-Norman Ltd began trials of their new \\"Cushioncraft\\"‚Äîtheir name for an air-cushion vehicle built for Elders and Fyffes. It was used to study the potential of this type of vehicle for the carriage of bananas from plantations in the Southern Cameroons. Together with its associated company, Crop Culture (Aerial) Ltd, Britten-Norman studied the potential for the Cushioncraft in many different countries. These investigations revealed the possibility of a break-through in transportation techniques by the use of air cushion vehicles which could accelerate the pace of development in territories where roads are nonexistent and costly to build and rivers are seasonally unnavigable Cushioncraft was reconstituted as a separate company in 1967 to permit British Hovercraft Corporation (BHC) to take a minority share holding, and it revived the name under which Britten-Norman's initial ACV endeavours were launched. Cushioncraft has an authorised capital of ¬£500,000 and issued capital of ¬£450,000, BHC paid Britten-Norman ¬£90,000 for a 20 percent stake in the company's hovercraft activities. The board of Cushioncraft comprised Messrs F. R. J. Britten, Desmond Norman, J. M. McMahon and F. H. Mann (all directors of Britten-Norman), Peter Winter (technical director), and A. R. B. Hobbs, BHC's nominee. In 1971, Britten-Norman encountered financial problems, and one result was that the Cushioncraft company was sold in 1972 to the British Hovercraft Corporation. Production Between 1960 and 1972 Cushioncraft designed 6 models of which 5 were produced. CC1 CC1 was the \\"second\\" hovercraft to lift off in 1960. The ground clearance of the CC1 was 12 to 15 inch. CC2 The 11 passenger CC2 was originally designed without a skirt and using air deflection within the cushion for propulsion. The CC2 was heavily developed over the years with the addition of a skirt and two external engines each driving a propellor for propulsion. The \\"bodywork\\" was also heavily modified. CC4 The CC4http://www.flightglobal.com/AIRSPACE/photos/hovercraftcutaways/images/13917/cushioncraft- cc4-cutaway.jpg was developed by Cushioncraft jointly with Hovercraft Development. It was intended to be the first car sized craft to be put into production - this never happened. Subsequent to development use by Cushioncraft, the CC4 was sold to the NPL for future research, HDL renamed it HU-4. CC5 One 6/8 seater CC5 was built, during tests off Priory Bay (Isle of Wight) it capsized and was written off in October 1966. CC6 The CC6 concept hovercraft was designed circa 1966. This was to be a small vehicle/passenger craft (4 to 6 cars and 30 to 40 passengers) using the quiet centrifugal fan configuration for lift and propulsion developed from the CC4 and CC5. The Cushioncraft CC-6 18-ton mixed-traffic ferry craft was to be built jointly by the Vosper Thorneycroft shipbuilding group at Portsmouth. This was the effect of an agreement between Vosper and Cushioncraft, under which Vosper were to be major sub-contractors in the construction of the craft. Development was to be financed jointly by Cushioncraft and the National Research Development Corporation (NRDC). Cushioncraft's facilities at St Helen's, IoW, were considered inadequate for CC-6 production. CC7 The CC7 was a development of the CC5, built in aluminium with inflatable side decks - the first Cushioncraft to use a gas turbine engine (all previous being piston). A stretched version offering 17 passenger places was proposed after the company was taken over by BHC. *Power Plant Lift and thrust engine: one United Aircraft of Canada ST-6B60DK marine gas turbine (a modified Pratt & Whitney Canada ST6) developing 390 b.h.p. at 6,000 r.p:m. *Dimensions Overall length 24 ft 4in; overall beam 15 ft 2in; beam with sidebodies deflated 7 ft 6in; height 7 ft 8in.

The lake is 1.6 km wide, 29 km long, and up to 152 m deep. The community of Savona is located at the west end of the lake on the Thompson River. The city of Kamloops is located a few miles east of the head of the lake, at the confluence of the North and South Thompson Rivers. Basin of the Thompson River The lake is bounded on all sides by steep embankments, with level areas found only near creek deltas and around the inlet and outlet. The surrounding land is mostly uninhabited. It is classified as dry belt interior grasslands, composed of bunchgrass and sagebrush with pockets of Douglas fir, Ponderosa pine and spruce. Kamloops Lake is widening, deepening, thickening and thrusting into the Thompson River, which enters at the east end and exits at the west end. The limnology of the lake is controlled by the thick tip of the Thompson River, which has thick fluctuations in annual flow, with over 60% occurring in the early summer during freshet (May to July). Lake levels rise naturally as much as from high season in June compared to low season. Conversely, beach areas expand by as much as in the summer as lake levels recede after freshet. Bulk residence times are very short (the time it takes for the water in the lake to be replaced with new water), ranging from 20 days to 340 days, with a mean of 60 days. Because Kamloops Lake is fed by both the North and South Thompson rivers (the South Thompson drains from the very warm Shuswap Lakes), Kamloops Lake is a very warm lake. Since the late twentieth century, it has become an increasingly popular boating and recreational area. On the north side of the lake is Fredrick, and on the south side of the lake are residential subdivisions such as Cherry Creek and the Tobiano resort community. A boat launch, trestle and gas dock have been built at Tobiano; it is the only location on Kamloops Lake with these facilities. Both Savona and Kamloops also have boat launches, but their use is limited in the later summer months of low water.

He was born in Dalsland and went to the United States in 1911, sailing in steerage first on board the Swedish ship Oslo, sailing from Gothenburg to Hull, England; and thence on the White Star Line ship Cymric, sailing from Liverpool to Boston; his destination was Minneapolis. After spending some time in the Industrial Workers of the World he became one of the founders of the American Communist Party and later became a Trotskyist and one of the co-founders of the Socialist Workers Party. Early Life in Sweden As Carl entered his teens his father died, making it necessary for him, as the oldest child, to leave school and earn a living for the family. He found a job in a pulp mill. Wages were low and working conditions hard in the mill, so Skoglund organized a union and lead a strike for better conditions. Through his experience in the class struggle, he became interested in Marxism and joined the Swedish Social Democratic Party. Later on Skoglund was called up for service in the Swedish army. When the conscripts were kept in uniform beyond the legal period of compulsory service, he became one of the leaders of a soldiers' protest movement demanding that they be demobilized. For his militant political activities, Skoglund was blacklisted and could not find a job in Sweden. In 1911, he decided to go to the United States. His fianc√©e remained behind and they were never rejoined. In America In the United States, Skoglund joined the IWW and spent a period on a railroad construction gang after which he went into the woods working as a lumberjack. There he suffered a serious foot injury, after which the company fired him. Skoglund went to Minneapolis where he sought medical care, maintaining himself by working as a janitor and boiler tender. As the injury mended and he could get around better, he worked as a mechanic and took job as a car repairman in the railway shop. Skoglund joined the Socialist Party of Eugene V. Debs in 1914 and became one of the left-wing leaders of the Party's Scandinavian Federation. Skoglund helped translate the works of Karl Marx from German to English. In 1917, a split in the Socialist Party was caused by the Russian Revolution in which the left-wing of the party provided the main force to found the American Communist Party in 1919, which became affiliated with the Communist International led by Lenin, Zinoviev and Trotsky. Carl Skoglund was one of the founding members of the American Communist Party. In 1922, after having been the organizer and leader of a major strike, Skoglund was blacklisted on the railroads, and he had to turn to driving a coal truck for a living. Recollections of a striker (Workday Minnesota by Dave Riehle) Socialist Workers Party Carl Skoglund was expelled from the Communist Party in 1928 for opposing Stalinism and supporting Trotsky and Bolshevism‚ÄìLeninism. Carl Skoglund helped the American Trotskyist James P. Cannon (also expelled from the CP) to found the Socialist Workers Party in 1938. Skoglund also played an important part in the great Teamsters strike in Minneapolis in the 1930s together with Farrell Dobbs and Ray Dunne. Skoglund was one of the 18 SWP leaders (including Cannon, Dunne, and Dobbs) imprisoned in World War II under the Smith Act. The US government tried to deport Carl Skoglund in the 1950s and he was still under deportation orders on the day he died in 1960.Carl Skoglund (International Socialist Review, Winter 1961) Referencesother Sources *Ross, Carl Radicalism in Minnesota, 1900-1960: a survey of selected sources (Minnesota Historical Society Press. 1994) 1884 births 1960 deaths People from Dalsland American people of Swedish descent Industrial Workers of the World members Members of the Socialist Party of America Members of the Communist Party USA Members of the Socialist Workers Party (United States) Socialist Workers Party (United States) politicians People convicted under the Smith Act Swedish emigrants to the United States Swedish communists American trade unionists of Swedish descent Minnesota socialists ","title":"Carl Skoglund"},{"id":"1355251","text":"Education policy consists of the principles and government policies in the educational sphere as well as the collection of laws and rules that govern the operation of education systems. Education occurs in many forms for many purposes through many institutions. Examples include early childhood education, kindergarten through to 12th grade, two and four year colleges or universities, graduate and professional education, adult education and job training. Therefore, education policy can directly affect the education people engage in at all ages. Examples of areas subject to debate in education policy, specifically from the field of schools, include school size, class size, school choice, school privatization, tracking, teacher selection, education and certification, teacher pay, teaching methods, curricular content, graduation requirements, school infrastructure investment, and the values that schools are expected to uphold and model. Issues in education policy also address problems within higher education. The Pell Institute analyzes the barriers experienced by teachers and students within community colleges and universities. These issues involve undocumented students, sex education, and federal grant aides.American Psychiatric Association. (2000). Practice guidelines for the treatment of patients with eating disorders (2nd ed). Washington, DC: Author. Education policy analysis is the scholarly study of education policy. It seeks to answer questions about the purpose of education, the objectives (societal and personal) that it is designed to attain, the methods for attaining them and the tools for measuring their success or failure. Research intended to inform education policy is carried out in a wide variety of institutions and in many academic disciplines. Important researchers are affiliated with departments of psychology, economics, sociology, and human development, in addition to schools and departments of education or public policy. Examples of education policy analysis may be found in such academic journals as Education Policy Analysis Archives and in university policy centers such as the National Education Policy Center housed at the University of Colorado Boulder University of Colorado Boulder.  Education reform in the United States  Education reform is a topic that is in the mainstream currently in the United States. Over the past 30 years, policy makers have made a steady increase at the state and federal levels of government in their involvement of US schools. US states spend most of their budgets funding schools, whereas only a small portion of the federal budget is allocated to education.Coggins, C. (2017). How to be heard: 10 lessons teachers need to advocate for their students and profession. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass. Although states hold the constitutional right on education policy, the federal government is advancing their role by building on state and local education policies. Education Reform is currently being seen as a \\"tangled web\\" due to the nature of education authority. There are several authorities looking over education and what can and cannot be implemented. Some education policies/reforms are being defined at either the federal, state or local level and in most cases, their focuses/authority overlap one another.Manna, Paul, and Patrick McGuinn. ‚ÄúThe Tall Task of Education Governance Reform.‚Äù Education Governance for the Twenty-First Century: Overcoming the Structural Barriers to School Reform, edited by Paul Manna and Patrick McGuinn, Brookings Institution Press, 2013, pp. 375‚Äì392. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/10.7864/j.ctt4cg877.20. This form of authority have led many to believe there is an inefficiency within education governance. Compared to other OECD countries, educational governance in the US is more decentralized and most of its autonomy is found within the state and district levels. The reason for this is that US citizens put an emphasis on individual rights and fear federal government overreach.Vergari, Sandra. ‚ÄúEducation Governance in Canada and the United States.‚Äù Education Governance for the Twenty-First Century: Overcoming the Structural Barriers to School Reform, edited by Paul Manna and Patrick McGuinn, Brookings Institution Press, 2013, pp. 231‚Äì251.

A recent report by the National Center on Education and the Economy, believes that the education system is neither coherent nor likely to see improvements due to the nature of it.5-24 Paper Final V11 - Ncee.org. www.ncee.org/wp- content/uploads/2011/05/Standing-on-the-Shoulders-of-Giants-An-American- Agenda-for-Education-Reform.pdf. In the state of Texas during the 84th Legislature, there were several education reform bills filed and sponsored by many education reform groups, such as Texans for Education Reform. Lawmakers want to create more involvement at the local level, and more transparency in our public schools. These groups are being pressured and opposed by teachers' unions saying that accountability and transparency policies are targeting educators, and that they are trying to hold them responsible for the education system.  Teacher policy  Teacher policy is education policy that addresses the preparation, recruitment, and retention of teachers. A teacher policy is guided by the same overall vision and essential characteristics as the wider education policy: it should be strategic, holistic, feasible, sustainable, and context-sensitive. Overall objectives and major challenges to be addressed, the funding to achieve these objectives, the demographic parameters of the learner population and the human resources required to achieve universally accessible quality education should all be addressed in a comprehensive teacher policy.  Nine key dimensions  Nine key dimensions are considered crucial to any comprehensive teacher policy: Teacher Recruitment and Retention, Teacher education (initial and continuing), Deployment, Career Structures/Paths, Teacher Employment and Working Conditions, Teach Reward and Remuneration, Teacher Standards, Teacher Accountability, and School Governance. = Teacher Recruitment and Retention = An effective education system must have a way to attract and retain outstanding educators. There has been a growing demand for teachers but the supply continues to diminish and many of them leave their profession This development is a threat to the ‚Äúacademic and economic welfare of students.‚Äù It affects learning and drain taxpayers‚Äô money The federal and state governments along with the districts must invest in complete human capital systems. It is the best approach in preparing and retaining committed and capable mentors for the long-term A reasonable strategy in talent management for the education sector must focus on recruitment, development, and retention of intelligent and efficient teachers. = Teacher Education (Initial and Continuing) = Teachers need to go back to school periodically to become better educators. Good mentors can become outstanding by going further than textbooks. This is the logic behind continuing education. Technology in the form of web-based workshops and lectures will be helpful. School administrators and district officials must push their teachers to make use of available resources and opportunities to continue the learning process. Conferences with workshops are also valuable because these activities provide teachers with tools for integration of technology in the classrooms and Continuing Professional Development Units in boosting their careers.  Gender equality  Twenty countries whose education sector plans were reviewed from a gender equality perspective Quality and timely data and evidence are key factors for policy-making, planning and the delivery to advance gender equality in and through education. They can help countries to identify and analyse gendered patterns and trends, and better plan and target resources to address gender inequalities. They can also help to identify and inform interventions that influence participation, learning and empowerment, from early childhood to tertiary education and beyond. Though the SDG 4 monitoring framework is a step forward in the policy process, a complete monitoring framework for gender equality in and through education should include indicators that consider: social and gender norms, values and attitudes (many of which can be influenced by education); education laws and policies, as well legislation and policies outside of the education system; resource distribution; and teaching and learning practices and environments.UNESCO. 2018.

Life and career A daughter of formerly enslaved parents, Nellie (Simon) and John Winfrey, she was born Florence Winfrey in 1896 in Washington, D.C. She began performing as a child. At the age of six she sang duets with her two older sisters, Olivia and Maude.\\"Biography\\", FlorenceMills.com. They eventually formed a vaudeville act, calling themselves the Mills Sisters.\\"Early Days Desperate, Says Flo\\", Pittsburgh Courier, February 28, 1925, p. 14. The act did well, appearing in theaters along the Atlantic seaboard. Florence's sisters eventually quit performing, but Florence stayed with it, determined to pursue a career in show business. She joined Ada Smith, Cora Green, and Carolyn Williams in the Panama Four, which had some success. She then joined a traveling black show, the Tennessee Ten, in which in 1917 she met the dance director and acrobatic dancer Ulysses \\"Slow Kid\\" Thompson (1888‚Äì1990), to whom she would be married from 1921 until her death.\\"Florence Mills\\" at Black Renaissance. Mills became well known in New York as a result of her role in the successful Broadway musical Shuffle Along (1921) at Daly's 63rd Street Theatre (barely on Broadway), one of the events marking the beginning of the Harlem Renaissance. She received favorable reviews in London, Paris, Ostend, Liverpool, and other European venues. She told the press that despite her years in vaudeville, she credited Shuffle Along with launching her career. After Shuffle Along, Lew Leslie, a white promoter, hired Mills and Thompson to appear nightly at the Plantation Club. The revue featured Mills and a wide range of black artists, including visiting performers such as Paul Robeson. In 1922, Leslie turned the nightclub acts into a Broadway show, The Plantation Revue. It opened at the Forty-Eighth Street Theatre on July 22. The English theatrical impresario Charles B. Cochran brought the Plantation company to London, and they appeared at the London Pavilion in spring 1923 in a show he produced, Dover Street to Dixie, with a local all-white cast in the first half and Mills starring with the all- black Plantation cast in the second half.Bill Egan, Florence Mills: Harlem Jazz Queen (Scarecrow Press, 2006), pp. 86‚Äì96. In 1924 she headlined at the Palace Theatre, the most prestigious booking in vaudeville, and became an international star with the hit show Lew Leslie's Blackbirds (1926).\\"Smiling Joe - The Plantation Orchestra, from C.B. Cochran's Blackbirds Revue of 1926. Columbia 4185\\", at YouTube. Among her fans when she toured Europe was Edward, the then Prince of Wales, who told the press that he had seen Blackbirds 11 times.Rob Roy. \\"Florence Mills Phenominal [sic] Reign\\", Chicago Defender, April 9, 1955, p. 7. Many in the black press admired her popularity and saw her as a role model: not only was she a great entertainer but she was also able to serve as \\"an ambassador of good will from the blacks to the whites... a living example of the potentialities of the Negro of ability when given a chance to make good\\".\\"Florence Mills\\", Pittsburgh Courier, November 12, 1927, p. A8. Mills was featured in Vogue and Vanity Fair and was photographed by Bassano's studios and Edward Steichen. Her signature song was her biggest hit, \\"I'm a Little Blackbird Looking for a Bluebird\\". Another of her hit songs was \\"I'm Cravin' for that Kind of Love\\". 1923 Death Exhausted from more than 300 performances of the hit show Blackbirds in London in 1926, she became ill with tuberculosis. She died of infection following an operation at the Hospital for Joint Diseases in New York City, New York on November 1, 1927. She was 31 years old. Most sources, including black newspapers, such as the Chicago Defender and the Pittsburgh Courier, and mainstream publications, including the New York Times and the Boston Globe, reported that she died of complications from appendicitis.For example, \\"Final Curtain\\", Chicago Defender, November 5, 1927, p. 1; \\"Florence Mills Dies of Appendicitis\\", New York Times, November 2, 1927. Her death shocked the music world. The New York Times reported that more than 10,000 people visited the funeral home to pay their respects;\\"10,000 Pay Tribute to Florence Mills\\", New York Times, November 3, 1927, p. 27. thousands attended her funeral, including James Weldon Johnson, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and stars of the stage, vaudeville and dance. Honorary pall bearers including singers Ethel Waters, Cora Green, and Lottie Gee, all of whom had performed with Mills. Dignitaries and political figures of both races sent their condolences.\\"Scores Collapse at Mills Funeral\\", New York Times, November 7, 1927, p. 25. She is buried at Woodlawn Cemetery, in the Bronx, New York. Her widower, Ulysses Thompson, a native of Prescott, Arkansas, was a dancer and comedian, having learned his trade in the tough world of circuses and traveling medicine shows in the early years of the century. He subordinated his career to hers, acting as her manager, promoter, minder and companion. After her death, he continued performing, traveling around the world, including appearances in China and Australia, until the late 1930s. He later married Gertrude Curtis, New York's first black woman dentist (1911) and the widow of the lyricist Cecil Mack (born as Richard Cecil McPherson). Thompson outlived both of his wives; he died in 1990, at the age of 101, in Little Rock, Arkansas. Legacy Mills is credited with having been a staunch and outspoken supporter of equal rights for African Americans, with her signature song \\"I'm a Little Blackbird\\" being a plea for racial equality, and during her life she broke many racial barriers.Florence Wetzel, review of Florence Mills: Harlem Jazz Queen, March 31, 2006, AllAboutJazz. After her death, Duke Ellington memorialized Mills in his composition Black Beauty. Fats Waller also memorialized Mills in a song, Bye Bye Florence, recorded in Camden, New Jersey, on November 14, 1927, featuring Bert Howell on vocals with organ by Waller; Florence was recorded with Juanita Stinette Chappell on vocals and Waller on organ. Other songs recorded the same day include You Live On in Memory and Gone but Not Forgotten‚ÄîFlorence Mills, neither of which were composed by Waller. English composer Constant Lambert - also a friend and champion of Duke Ellington - saw Florence Mills when she performed in Dover Street to Dixie at the London Pavilion in 1923, and again when she visited London a second time in 1926-7 for her show Blackbirds. On her death Lambert immediately wrote the piano piece Elegaic Blues in tribute, orchestrating it the following year. The rising triplet near the beginning (bar 8) is a quote from the fanfare that opened Blackbirds.Notes to Hyperion recording of Constant Lambert's Elegaic Blues', 2005 The Florence Mills Theatre opened on 8 December 1930 at 3511 South Central Avenue, Los Angeles. The 740-seat theater was commissioned by Sam Kramer. On opening night almost 1,000 people lined the street, with 10 police officers holding back the crowds.Black in Blackface: A sourcebook on early Black Musical Shows by Henry T. Sampson, publ.

Mark Millar wrote most of the first 33 issues, followed by Brian Michael Bendis for 12 issues, Brian K. Vaughan for 20 issues, and Robert Kirkman for 28 issues. Aron Eli Coleite, known for his work on the television series Heroes, took over the book for the remaining seven issues, concluding with his Requiem story. Film director Bryan Singer, who directed X-Men and X2: X-Men United, was scheduled to write 12 issues of Ultimate X-Men with Brian K. Vaughan and X2 scripters Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris, but was unable to commit due to working on the Superman Returns film. Mark Millar Ultimate X-Men was the second comic to debut as part of the Ultimate Marvel line, predated a few months by Ultimate Spider-Man. Mark Millar reinvented the X-Men with the first X-Men film (which debuted seven months before) as his only reference. The plot of \\"The Tomorrow People\\" was what Millar had in mind for the first X-Men film, and \\"Return to Weapon X\\" would have been the plot to the sequel. As in the film, Millar's original X-Men consisted of telepath Professor X, Cyclops (whose eyes shoot concussive beams) telepath/telekinetic Jean Grey, weather-manipulating Storm, simian genius Beast, metal-skinned Colossus, and cryokinetic Iceman. In its first year, the series was the best-selling comic book of 2001. The Tomorrow People *Originally published in: Ultimate X-Men #1-6 (February 2001 - July 2001) *Creators: writer Mark Millar, artist Adam Kubert (#1-4), Andy Kubert (#5-6) *Plot outline: The government begins building and releasing Sentinels to hunt mutants after the Brotherhood of Mutant Supremacy declares war against humans. Professor Charles Xavier unites a group of teenage mutants to form a group called the \\"X-Men\\" to stop the Brotherhood. Millar immediately establishes differences between the mainstream and Ultimate universes by reinventing the pasts and motives of several characters. For example, Jean Grey recruits Colossus after a nuclear arms deal goes bad, and Wolverine joins the team with the ulterior motive of assassinating Professor Xavier. Some themes remain the same, however, such as the love triangle involving Wolverine, Jean Grey and Cyclops. *First appearances: Colossus, Cyclops, Beast, Storm, Iceman, Jean Grey, Wolverine, Magneto, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch, Sentinels, Mastermind, Blob, Toad *Notes: This arc's main plot revolves around Wolverine's search for his past and the Weapon X facility. Originally, Adam and Andy Kubert were both to illustrate Ultimate X-Men so that it could be published on a regular basis, but Andy moved to illustrating Origin and was unable to continue. The series' first arc sold extremely well: the first issue sold out, and the fourth and fifth issues sold more than 100,000 copies each to U.S. comic book stores alone. Return to Weapon X *Originally published in: Ultimate X-Men #7-12 (August 2001 - January 2002) *Creators: writer Mark Millar, artist Adam Kubert *Plot outline: While Wolverine is away, Xavier and his X-Men are kidnapped and taken to Weapon X. Wolverine tricks Weapon X into capturing him so he can lead the Brotherhood into Weapon X and free his companions. The mutants are ready to begin a massacre, but General Nick Fury steps in, arrests the Weapon X staff and declares all mutants free. *First appearances: Nightcrawler, Rogue, Juggernaut, Doctor Cornelius, Sabretooth *Notes: Millar continues to distinguish settings in the Ultimate universe from their mainstream counterparts. In this arc, Weapon X is introduced as a S.H.I.E.L.D.-initiated project (based in Finland) to force mutants to carry out covert missions for the government. John Wraith (aka Kestrel) and Dr. Abraham Cornelius are established as the heads of Weapon X, while Nightcrawler, Rogue, and Juggernaut have been part of the Weapon X team for some time. Mark Millar had a kidney infection during the summer of 2001 and wrote two of the issues in this arc in the hospital, leading to a darker- than-normal tone. While Rogue has always been portrayed as a Southern Baptist, Ultimate Rogue is more believing and devout than Rogue in the normal Marvel continuity. You Always Remember Your First Love *Originally published in: Ultimate X-Men #13-14 (February 2002 - March 2002) *Creators: writer Chuck Austen, artist Esad Ribiƒá *Plot outline: Cajun mutant Remy Lebeau (Gambit) is homeless on the streets of New York. One day, he takes in a little girl whose parents have been murdered. When she, too, is abducted, he takes bloody revenge on those responsible: Hammerhead and his mob henchmen. *First appearances: Gambit, Hammerhead *Deaths: Hammerhead, although he later returns in the Ultimate Spider-Man series (how he returns from the dead is unexplained). *Notes: This is the only arc which features writer Chuck Austen, who got the job of writing Uncanny X-Men because of his work on Ultimate X-Men. This arc preceded Austen's eventual resignation from Marvel and controversy at DC Comics. A Different World is Possible Originally published in: Ultimate X-Men #15 (April 2002) Plot outline: Professor Xavier talks with Colossus and Magneto about his new book and the mutant war. World Tour *Originally published in: Ultimate X-Men #16-20 (May 2002 - September 2002) *Creators: writer Mark Millar, artists Chris Bachalo and Adam Kubert *Plot outline: The X-Men are shocked to find that Magneto is still alive and Xavier is trying to rehabilitate him. Xavier's mutant son David MacTaggert (Proteus) escapes from Moira's secret mutant hospital on Muir Island (off the northern coast of Scotland), and he kills thousands while possessing Betsy Braddock. David and Betsy are finally killed by Colossus (who considers leaving the X-Men, but changes his mind). *First appearances: Betsy Braddock, David MacTaggert, Illyana Rasputin, Acolytes *Deaths: David MacTaggert, Betsy Braddock (though her consciousness survives) *Notes: The Ultimate version of Proteus is an amalgam of Legion (David Xavier, Charles Xavier's and Gabrielle Haller's son) and the mainstream version of Proteus (Kevin MacTaggert, son of Moira MacTaggert). In the original Proteus saga (Uncanny X-Men #125-128, 1979) Proteus is killed by Colossus, who drops a car on him. Millar has described this arc as \\"X-Men meets Magnolia.\\" In this arc, Colossus' rescue of a capsized submarine crew is an allusion to the real-life Kursk submarine disaster. Millar also hints that Colossus may be gay, with Piotr remarking that his favourite show is Will & Grace (which features a gay male lead). Hellfire and Brimstone *Originally published in: Ultimate X-Men #21-25 (October 2002 - January 2003) *Creators: writer Mark Millar, artists Kaare Andrews and Adam Kubert *Plot outline: The remnants of Magneto's Brotherhood, led by Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, destroy the nuclear arsenals of India and Pakistan to get into the good graces of the U.S. government. Shadowcat is recruited, while Wolverine and Cyclops fight over Jean. All three go to the Savage Land, and Shadowcat saves Wolverine and Cyclops from a giant computer. Meanwhile, the Hellfire Club awakens the \\"Phoenix force\\" in Jean, and she kills the whole club. The Brotherhood frees Magneto. *First appearances: Shadowcat, The Hellfire Club *Deaths: The Hellfire Club *Notes: While the previous arc was action-oriented, Millar uses this storyline to more fully develop his characters. The love triangle involving Jean, Scott, and Wolverine, heats up and is much more violent than in the original version. In \\"Ultimate Marvel\\" Millar depicts Shadowcat as a bright, clever girl, but she's not as smart as her mainstream counterpart (created by John Byrne and Chris Claremont). Ultimate War *Originally published in: Ultimate War #1-4 (February 2003 - April 2003) *Creators: writer Mark Millar, artist Chris Bachalo *Plot outline: The Brotherhood declares the second war against humanity, and Xavier and the X-Men are branded as traitors. Things get worse when Wolverine and Shadowcat report that Cyclops has been killed in the Savage Land. The Ultimates track down the X-Men and have an all- out fight in New York. Xavier is captured but, thanks to Iceman, the rest escape. *Deaths: Cyclops (apparently) *Notes: \\"Ultimate War\\" is not purely an X-Men arc; rather, it is the first crossover between the Ultimates and the Ultimate X-Men, although it establishes the plot for the \\"Return of the King\\" arc. A fight between the X-Men and the Avengers (the mainstream Marvel version of the Ultimates) was also the subject of X-Men (vol. 1) #9 (1965) by Stan Lee. Return of the King *Originally published in: Ultimate X-Men #26-33 (February 2003 - July 2003) *Creators: writer Mark Millar, artist Adam Kubert and David Finch *Plot outline: The Brotherhood plans an attack on humanity. Cyclops is alive, but at the bottom of a pit (thanks to Wolverine). Forge has created a machine to amplify Magneto's powers, but Shadowcat and the X-Men foil the Brotherhood's plans. In the end, the X-Men turn themselves over to the authorities and are pardoned. Betsy Braddock is revealed to be alive after her consciousness passes to the body of a comatose Asian girl named Kwannon. *First appearances: Forge, Kwannon *Deaths: Sabretooth *Notes: In this arc, Rogue switches sides of her own free will to help the X-Men prevent a nuclear explosion. In the mainstream Marvel Comics, she switches sides because she absorbs the mind of superhero Carol Danvers (Uncanny X-Men #171). Brian Michael Bendis After Mark Millar's tenure, Ultimate Spider-Man writer Brian Michael Bendis took over for a year. Bendis was originally slated to write both Ultimate X-Men and Ultimate Spider-Man from their conception, but turned down Ultimate X-Men because of the challenge of writing a team book. He has stated that he was going to plot his story in a more character-driven way‚Äìespecially concerning Wolverine, who has previously tried to kill his teammate Cyclops. Blockbuster *Originally published in: Ultimate X-Men #34-39 (August 2003 - January 2004) *Creators: writer Brian Michael Bendis, artist David Finch *Plot outline: This arc focuses on Wolverine as unknown assailants ambush him. Wolverine tries to learn the motives of his attackers with the help of Spider-Man and Daredevil, stars of comics Bendis had previously written. Wolverine learns they are ex-Weapon X members, and he is then saved by the X-Men. The assailants kill themselves rather than reveal any further information. Later, a S.H.I.E.L.D. attack force arrives and reveals that the Weapon X team members are only flunkies in a larger, more insidious anti-mutant conspiracy. *First appearances: Daredevil, Dum Dum Dugan *Notes: Colorist Dave Stewart, who colored Ultimate X-Men #39, won an Eisner Award in 2005 for his work on Ultimate X-Men, Daredevil, and Captain America. New Mutants *Originally published in: Ultimate X-Men #40-45 (February 2004 - July 2004) *Creators: writer Brian Michael Bendis, artist David Finch *Plot outline: The first three issues of this arc are stand-alone introductions of individual characters, including Ultimate versions of Angel, Jude the Entropic Man, and Dazzler. Meanwhile, the government has Emma Frost create a mutant team. She recruits Alex Summers, Dazzler, Karma, and Beast. At the team's kickoff a Sentinel is defeated by the X-Men, but not before Beast is killed. *First appearances: Angel, Dazzler, Havok, Emma Frost, Karma *Deaths: Beast *Notes: Bendis continued the tradition of modernizing mainstream characters when introducing them into the Ultimate Universe. For example, Dazzler debuted in 1980 as a disco star in the regular Marvel continuity. In Ultimate Marvel continuity, she is a punk rocker. Brian K. Vaughan believed \\"Ultimate Dazzler...may very well be Bendis' single greatest contribution to the free world,\\" which led to her continued integration as part of the X-Men in his later story arcs. The mainstream version of Emma Frost is a telepath and former member of the Hellfire Club, who later becomes an educator and gains the power to turn into organic diamond. Bendis introduces her Ultimate counterpart as an educator who turns into diamond, without her original powers or membership. Brian K. Vaughan Brian K. Vaughan created many stand-alone story arcs, tying them together during the final arc. Although he was initially worried about alienating new readers or hard-core fans, he eventually focused on \\"simply trying to tell great stories about young people who are feared and hated because they're different.\\" He was originally slated to write just four issues, but enjoyed working on Ultimate X-Men and ultimately wrote 20 issues. Marvel asked him to extend his run when production on Superman Returns prevented Bryan Singer from starting his run. Vaughan turned down the offer, and finished his run with \\"Magnetic North\\". The Tempest *Originally published in: Ultimate X-Men #46-49 (July 2004 - September 2004) *Creators: writer Brian K. Vaughan, artist Brandon Peterson *Plot outline: The X-Men investigate a series of mutant killings. The killer is Nathaniel Essex (also known as Mr. Sinister), who has delusions that a \\"Lord Apocalypse\\" is ordering him to kill mutants. Sinister infiltrates the Institute, defeats Xavier, Iceman and Angel, and is about to go on a killing spree when Rogue knocks him out and saves the day. Sinister is taken into custody by S.H.I.E.L.D. *First appearances: Mr. Sinister, Northstar, Synch, Marrow, Apocalypse, Sunspot Cry Wolf *Originally published in: Ultimate X-Men #50-53 (October 2004 - January 2005) *Creators: writer Brian K. Vaughan, artist Andy Kubert *Plot outline: On a field trip, the X-Men are ambushed by Gambit, who leaves a wake of destruction, and uses the chaos to kidnap Rogue. He presents her to his superiors (the Fenris twins), who offer Rogue the ability to touch. She refuses, and flees with Gambit. Later Rogue, saying she feels alienated by the X-Men, leaves with Gambit. Wolverine and Storm temporarily leave the team. *First appearances: Fenris, Wolfsbane *Notes: Issue #50 marked the return of artist Andy Kubert, who illustrated issues #5 and #6, and was originally slated to be a recurring artist. There is a love triangle among Shadowcat, Rogue and Iceman in this arc. Vaughan suggests that Iceman is attracted to Rogue because the two can never be intimate. The Most Dangerous Game *Originally published in: Ultimate X-Men #54-57 (February 2005 - May 2005) *Creators: writer Brian K. Vaughan, artist Stuart Immonen *Plot outline: Mojo Adams produces a reality show on Krakoa, where his assassin, Arcade, hunts and kills accused mutant felons. Mojo's current and longest-lasting contestant, Longshot, is accused of killing Lord Scheele (a Genoshan politician and the lover of Longshot's off again-on again girlfriend Spiral). Professor Xavier sends half of the X-Men to the island to investigate. Other members of the X-Men (led by Dazzler) travel to the island without Xavier's knowledge to free Longshot. Xavier becomes angry when it turns out Longshot is guilty. An injured Angel takes the blame for Dazzler, and they start dating. *First appearances: Mojo, Longshot, Spiral, Major Domo, Arcade *Notes: This arc's plot is similar to the man-hunting plot from Richard Connell's 1924 short story, \\"The Most Dangerous Game.\\" Several of the characters are adapted from the mainstream universe, with major changes placing them on Earth instead of in alternate realities. Mojo, an overweight alien, becomes Mojo Adams, an overweight albino human. Major Domo, Mojo's right-hand alien, becomes a businessman. Longshot is transformed from a heroic alien into a mutant felon. The role of his girlfriend, Spiral, is reversed from villainess to victim. Arcade is an evil genius in mainstream Marvel, with no ties to Mojo. Vaughn was complimented for pulling off this story arc without using Wolverine, who is notably absent. Hard Lessons *Originally published in: Ultimate X-Men #58-60, Ultimate X-Men Annual #1 (June - Aug 2005, Oct 2005) *Creators: writer Brian K. Vaughan, artists Steve Dillon, Stuart Immonen, Tom Raney *Plot outline: Charles Xavier witnesses a bank robbery by a grotesque, psi-resistant conjoined twin mutant named Syndicate. Xavier realizes that they became criminal only to help their terminally-ill sister, and he offers the conjoined twins a chance to redeem themselves. He fakes Syndicate's death and instructs them to wait in a safe house. Storm picks up Wolverine in the north, where he is searching for his past. An adamantium-laced, cybernetically-enhanced Yuriko Oyama (aka Lady Deathstrike) attacks them. Her benefactor is the sinister Dr. Cornelius, from Weapon X. Cornelius is (apparently) killed, and Yuriko is restrained. Juggernaut escapes S.H.I.E.L.D.'s custody and tracks down Rogue, his old flame. He meets her (and her lover, Gambit) just after they have stolen the Crimson Gem of Cyttorak. Gambit loses his life in a fight with Juggernaut, who absorbs the gem. Rogue retrieves Gambit, giving him one last kiss before he dies. When Rogue phones her ex-boyfriend, Iceman, she is afraid that she has permanently absorbed Gambit's memories and powers. *First appearances: Syndicate, Lady Deathstrike *Deaths: Gambit *Notes: In the beginning of his run, Vaughan had difficulty bridging the gap between new and veteran readers, but found his stride during this collaboration with Steve Dillon. In the mainstream Marvel continuity, Yuriko Oyama is also an adamantium-laced cyborg. The Ultimate X-Men Annual #1 was published between issues #62 and #63 of Ultimate X-Men, four years into the series' run. It is the first annual for any X-Men line since Bill Jemas decided that additional regular issues should be printed, instead of publishing an annual. As with all other first annuals of the Ultimate line, this annual has a self-contained story. The annual proved to be a success, becoming the third annual in the Ultimate Marvel line to sell out. Magnetic North *Originally published in: Ultimate X-Men #61-65 (September 2005 - January 2006) *Creators: writer Brian K. Vaughan, artist Stuart Immonen *Plot outline: Emma Frost has assembled the Academy of Tomorrow, a second heroic mutant group consisting of Havok, Polaris, Northstar, Sunspot, Cypher and Cannonball. Lorna Dane (aka Polaris) is put into Magneto's plastic prison cell, because Forge and Mystique cause the AoT's first mission to go awry. The AoT frees her, and the X-Men are forced to fight the Ultimates when they try to stop the breakout. Professor X expels Angel for insubordination, only to send him to the AoT as a spy. Colossus reveals to Nightcrawler that he is dating Northstar, a hint that he is coming out. *First appearances: Mystique, Cannonball, Cypher, Polaris *Notes: Colossus comes out of the closet in Ultimate X-Men #65. In Ultimate Marvel, Mystique is reinvented as Magneto's right-hand woman (a parallel to the three X-Men movies). In the mainstream comics, Mystique and Magneto barely meet. Robert Kirkman Robert Kirkman took on the mantle of writer when Bryan Singer once again could not commit to writing for the title. His run was originally scheduled for only nine issues, but was extended. Kirkman believed the Ultimate Marvel universe had developed a strong enough footing in order to not have to rely on \\"who's getting Ultimatized this week.\\" He also believed that the Ultimate universe should retain its differences from the mainstream universe. As a result, he planned to introduce one character unique to the Ultimate universe and one character who already existed in the mainstream universe. These characters became the Magician and Lilandra Neramani, respectively. Date Night *Originally published in: Ultimate X-Men #66-68 (March 2006 - May 2006) *Creators: writer Robert Kirkman, artist Tom Raney *Plot outline: Kirkman explores the private lives of the X-Men as they finally have a night off for the first time since \\"The Tomorrow People\\" arc. Scott and Jean see a movie. Iceman and Rogue capitalize on her loss of powers, and make love. Wolverine and Storm go to a bar. Sabretooth attacks them in order to obtain a tissue sample from Logan to deliver to his superior, Doctor Cornelius of Weapon X. Piotr and Kurt visit a comatose Alison. Kurt is sad, because she chose Angel over him. He is also uncomfortable with Piotr's new lifestyle. Kitty meets her new crush, Spider- Man, and Xavier has dinner with Lilandra. Lilandra is head of the powerful and wealthy Shi'ar cult that worships a phoenix, who they think has been reborn in Jean Grey. Lilandra is the mainstream character Kirkman planned to introduce to the Ultimate universe at the start of his run. *First appearances: Magician, Lilandra Neramani, Shi'ar *Notes: In this arc, Kurt's homophobia takes on a hostile feel for the first time. Phoenix? *Originally published in: Ultimate X-Men #69-71 (June 2006 - August 2006) *Creators: writer Robert Kirkman, artist Ben Oliver *Plot Outline: Kirkman advances the Phoenix storyline, as Lilandra and her assistant examine Jean to determine whether she is the Phoenix deity or merely insane. Elliot Boggs (Magician) becomes the first original Ultimate universe character to join the X-Men, as the Brotherhood of Mutants attack the Academy of Tomorrow's homecoming dance. In side plots, Nightcrawler confesses to the comatose Dazzler that he hates Piotr for revealing his homosexuality, and Piotr goes on his first date with Jean-Paul to the homecoming dance. Rogue begins applying Gambit's powers in battle. *Notes: In issue #69, Kirkman wrote Wolverine out of the remainder of the story arc by having Nick Fury secretly ask him to meet in Harlem. This allows Wolverine to meet (and do battle with) the Hulk in the Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk miniseries. Magical *Originally published in: Ultimate X-Men #72-74 (September 2006 - November 2006) *Creators: writer Robert Kirkman, artist Tom Raney *Plot Outline: Magician's powers have no limits when he helps the X-Men battle the Friends of Humanity. Nick Fury visits the X-Mansion to inform Xavier that he wants to enlist Magician in the Ultimates. However, Xavier suspects something is amiss when he realizes Fury does not recall bringing Magician to the X-Men. A battle ensues when they realize Magician has manipulated the X-Men. Wolverine and Jean Grey defeat Magician, but Shadowcat later learns from Magician that his death was another deception. *Notes: Mike Cotton, senior staff writer of Wizard magazine, criticized Kirkman for his writing on issue #74. Cotton wrote that, while Kirkman is skilled, he failed to make the issue a must-read. The characters sounded like their 616 universe counterparts instead of teenagers. Breaking Point *Originally published in: Ultimate X-Men Annual #2 (October 2006) *Creators: writer Robert Kirkman, artist Salvador Larroca *Plot outline: Kirkman ties up several plot lines in this special issue. Flashbacks reveal Nightcrawler's Weapon-X training prior to joining the X-Men, and Rogue's worries about kissing Gambit when he died (and its aftereffects). In the present, Dazzler awakens from her coma, but is kidnapped by Nightcrawler, who has become obsessed with her. The X-Men rescue Dazzler and try to calm Nightcrawler. However, a fight breaks out when Nightcrawler insults Colossus' homosexuality. During the battle, Rogue discovers that Gambit's powers have left her and her own powers have returned. Nightcrawler's Weapon-X training helps him take out most of the team, until Rogue accidentally knocks him unconscious with her original powers. Dazzler quits the team when Professor Xavier decides to keep Nightcrawler unconscious, instead of having him arrested. Kitty confesses to Storm that she still has feelings for Iceman. *Notes: The origin of Xavier's pet cat, Mystique, is explained in a two-page extra story illustrated by Leinil Francis Yu. The issue was criticized for its chronology: Wolverine and Professor Xavier discuss events occurring at the end of the Magician storyline in this issue, although it was published before the conclusion of that arc. Cable *Originally published in: Ultimate X-Men #75-78 (December 2006 - March 2007) *Creators: writer Robert Kirkman and artists Ben Oliver and Yannick Paquette (main story), writer Sean McKeever and artist Mark Brooks (backup story) *Plot Outline: In this arc, the story diverts away from romance and drama and towards action. Cable, a time traveler, arrives in the present on Jean Grey's 20th birthday to assassinate Professor Xavier. Another time traveler, Bishop, arrives to save Professor Xavier's life. Cable kidnaps Jean Grey, and the X-Men take the fight to him. Xavier tries to put an end to the fight. When Cyclops tries to stop him, Xavier says that he loves Jean. Cyclops and the Professor arrive to stop Cable, but are no match for the mercenary. In the end, Cable's mission is successful. While he has kept Cyclops busy, he throws a futuristic grenade at Xavier, incinerating all but his skeleton. Cable and the other members of the Six Pack return to the future, leaving Bishop stranded in the present. *First appearances: Bishop, Cable, Six Pack *Deaths: Professor Xavier *Notes: Kirkman liked Cable's paramilitary look from his comic book appearances in the 1990s, so he made it his goal to have Cable \\"use every piece of equipment hanging off of him.\\" However, he chose to change Cable's history.

She is best known as the founder in 1935 of The Putney School, a progressive boarding school in Vermont. Early life Born in Omaha, Nebraska, Hinton was one of four children. Her father, Clement Chase, who owned a newspaper and a bookstore, was a women's rights advocate and encouraged Hinton's energetic nature and belief that she could do what she wished with her life. Her mother, Lula Belle Edwards, disagreed and tried unsuccessfully to mold Hinton into a more traditional woman's role. During her years at the Omaha's Episcopal School for Girls, Hinton found herself bored with the traditional education and turned to various extra curricular activities including working as an assistant in her father's store and playing tennis. At Bryn Mawr College, where she trained as a teacher, Hinton found a greater love of reading and the type of education she had been seeking earlier in life. She graduated in 1912, then moved to Chicago, where she lived at Hull House in 1913 as secretary to Jane Addams. At Hull House she enrolled in a two-year course on the playground, and soon after married Sebastian Hinton, a lawyer. Shortly after the wedding, she opened a nursery school based in their house and a park nearby. The school was considered a success, seeing its enrollment numbers doubling annually. Sebastian aided in her work by inventing various bits of playground equipment, and is credited with patenting the first playground jungle gym.Hinton's original patents for the \\"climbing structure\\" are filed July 22, 1920; filed October 1, 1920; filed October 1, 1920; and filed October 24, 1921. During the first six years of their marriage, the Hintons had three children, all of whom attended their mother's school. The family later moved to Winnetka, Illinois. Having frequently struggled with depression, in 1923 Sebastian checked himself into a clinic for treatment, but while there he committed suicide. Hinton was stunned by the events, and according to Susan McIntosh Lloyd, told only her siblings and her best friend, Jane Arms, the truth about Sebastian's death. His own children did not know how he really died until it was accidentally revealed to them by the same biographer. Hinton began teaching kindergarten at the North Shore Country Day School to keep herself busy. Feeling Winnetka was becoming a \\"society suburb\\", she moved her children to Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1925 and began teaching at the Shady Hill School. She later moved again to a farm in Weston, Massachusetts. The Putney School In 1934 a Hull House friend arranged the sale of Elm Lea Farm in Putney, Vermont for a reduced price for Hinton to found a school. There in 1935 she founded The Putney School, the first coeducational New England boarding school, an experiment in progressive education, and a working farm, which she was to direct until 1955. She based its structure on her belief in the value of manual labor, art and music, and scholarship as equally necessary components of a healthy adult life. At first it enrolled the children of wealthy progressives and liberals; and though all its students, staff, and faculty were heeded and treated as constituents by Hinton, she was the sole director of every aspect of the school. The school's early success depended largely on her forceful personality; in the late 1940s and early 1950s, though, many of the school's teachers began to resent her complete authority over its running. Eventually Hinton was forced to compromise with a nascent teachers' union on matters of salary, conditions, and procedure. After 1955 she continued to attend the school's meetings, though she was officially retired, and travelled, led trips, founded other education projects and summer camps, and gave speeches. Personal life Hinton was married to Sebastian Hinton, a patent attorney who is credited with inventing the jungle gym in 1920. Hinton had three children. Her daughter Jean Hinton Rosner (1917-2002) was a civil rights and peace activist. Her daughter Joan and her son William H. Hinton lived for decades in China before and after the revolution. William H. Hinton was a Marxist sinologist. William's daughter and Carmelita's granddaughter Carma Hinton is a documentary filmmaker (The Gate of Heavenly Peace).

Gaius Terentius Varro (fl. 218200 BC) was a Roman politician and general active during the Second Punic War. A plebeian son of a butcher, he was a populist politician who was elected consul for the year 216. While holding that office, he was decisively defeated by Hannibal at the Battle of Cannae. Early years Varro was a member of a plebeian family, the gens Terentia, and the first man of note in his family.Jerome S. Arkenberg, \\"Licinii Murenae, Terentii Varrones, and Varrones Murenae: I. A Prosopographical Study of Three Roman Families\\", Historia: Zeitschrift f√ºr Alte Geschichte, 42 (1993), pp. 326-351 His father was reportedly a butcher who had \\"employed his son in the menial tasks associated with that profession.\\"Livy. 22.25.18 Despite this low birth, on his father's death he used the inheritance to embark on a public career, making his name by prosecuting those of higher status and progressing through the various magistracies of the cursus honorum, holding the quaestorship and both the plebeian and curule aedileships.Livy. 22.26.1. When discussing the provenance of his cognomen, Servius suggests that this Varro served in the First Illyrian War.Maurus Servius Honoratus, Commentary on the Aeneid of Virgil, 11.743.. His first time in office for which details survive was the praetorship of 218 BC, during which he was perhaps posted in Sardinia.T.R.S. Broughton, The Magistrates of the Roman Republic, (American Philological Association, 1952). vol. I, p. 240. In 217 BC, having completed his praetorship, Varro was one of the few senators to support the elevation of Marcus Minucius Rufus to the dictatorship, apparently more because of the popular support of the plebeians that could be won by doing so than from any personal conviction. Not only was Varro successful in appointing Minucius co- dictator, but he was also elected consul for the year 216 BC. Consulship Varro and his colleague, Lucius Aemilius Paullus, assumed the consulship two years after the outbreak of the Second Punic War and the year after the dictator Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus had earned the epithet cunctator (delayer) by refusing to engage Hannibal's army in pitched battle. Varro and Paullus, though, took the rare step of combining the two consular armies, which each would normally lead separately, into an 85,000-strong force to face Hannibal. As was customary in such situations, the two consuls took charge of the force on alternating days.Polybius. 3.110.Oliver L. Spaulding, Jr. The Classical Element in the German War Plan of 1914, The Classical Weekly, Vol. 18, No. 18 (Mar. 16, 1925), p143. The two armies met at Cannae where the inexperienced Varro, using his day in command, pressed Paullus to attack. Hannibal enveloped the Roman force and inflicted huge losses. Paullus was killed in the battle while Varro escaped to Venusia with around 4,500 surviving troops.Livy. 22.54.1Polybius. 3.116. On receiving word that larger Roman forces were at Canusium, he marched the survivors to join them, creating a force of roughly equal size to a standard consular army.Livy. 22.54.6. Varro was recalled to a Rome overrun by a state of panic.Livy. 22.61. On arrival, he was greeted by a crowd who thanked him for not \\"despairing of the state\\" and taking his own life, thereby visibly choosing to fight on.Livy. 21.61.14. While there, he facilitated the appointment of Marcus Junius Pera as dictator to settle the immediate disaster. Varro then returned to the command of his troops, taking up positions at Apulia. Later in the year, he was again recalled to Rome to appoint Marcus Fabius Buteo as a second dictator, specifically for the purpose of promoting senators to replace those killed at Cannae.Livy. 23.22.10 215 to 207 BC Varro was prorogued in his position for the year 215, maintaining command of the force he had consolidated at Apulia,Livy. 23.23.11 before being sent to Picenum to levy new soldiers and guard the region.Livy. 23..32.19. He, along with all the other generals still serving around Italy, was prorogued again for the year 214 BC.Livy. 24.10.3 He received one of the 18 legions enrolled that year to carry out his duties.Livy. 24.10.3. He was prorogued again and kept the legion in Picenum for the next year.Livy.24.44.5.T.R.S. Broughton, The Magistrates of the Roman Republic, American Philological Association (1952). vol. I. p256. After leaving Picenum, Varro was next recorded as being a Propraetor, a citizen imbued with the authority of a praetor, charged with subduing a potential rebellion in the Etrurian town of Arretium. After securing 120 hostages from the town, Varro informed the Roman senate that the unrest was still not quelled. He was sent back with a legion to garrison Arretium.Livy. 27.24.9. He stayed in his command of Etruria for the year 207 BC, receiving a second legion from the Senate.Livy. 27.36.12. Later life Varro does not feature for the remainder of the Second Punic War, though later held two roles in the year 200 BC. He was part of a three-man diplomatic legation to North Africa, tasked with visiting Carthage, and senior Numidians.Livy. 31.11.6-7. The ambassadors were instructed to inform Carthage that, despite the conclusion of the war in 201, the general Hamilcar was continuing operations in Gaul and that Romans who had deserted to Carthage had not been repatriated. Furthermore, they took gifts and congratulations to Masinissa, whose alliance with Rome had proved pivotal at the Battle of Zama, on his becoming King of Numidia. Varro also returned to Venusia, serving as one of the three triumviri coloniae ducendae, charged with increasing the local population by adding new colonists after the town's losses during the Second Punic War.Livy. 31.49.6. It has been suggested he also served as a minter of coins down to the year 197 BC.Jerome S. Arkenberg. Licinii Murenae, Terentii Varrones, and Varrones Murenae: I.

She started playing the violin at the age of five and gave her first public concerts when she was only nine years old, performing Mozart's A major and Viotti's A minor violin concertos with the Presidential Symphony Orchestra. She continued her studies in Ankara under Walter Gerhard, Izzet Albayrak and Lico Amar. In 1949 she was sent to France on scholarship, under a special law passed by the Turkish Grand National Assembly. She studied with Gabriel Bouillon at the Conservatoire de Paris and graduated in 1952, winning the first prize. Upon returning homeland, starting from the 1960s, she gave concerts in Anatolia first with the Turkish pianist Ferhunde Erkin and then with G√ºlay Uƒüurata regularly. Her partnership with Uƒüurata lasted 29 years. After Uƒüurata's death, she formed a duo with the pianist Cana G√ºrmen. Suna Kan's extensive concert tours have so far covered most parts of the world, including England, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Russia, China, Japan, South American countries, Canada and the United States. She has performed with many international orchestras such as the London Symphony, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Bamberg Symphony, Residentie Orchestra (the Netherlands), Moscow Symphony, French National Radio Symphony (ORTF) under great conductors like Istv√°n Kert√©sz, Arthur Fiedler, Walter Susskind, Hans Rosbaud, Zubin Mehta, Gotthold Lessing, Louis Fr√©maux and Michel Plasson. She also collaborated with celebrated artists like Yehudi Menuhin, Igor Bezrodny, Pierre Fournier, Andr√© Navarra, and Frederick Riddle in performing double concertos. In the 1970s Suna Kan acted as one of the founders of TRT Ankara Chamber Orchestra together with conductor G√ºrer Aykal and music critic Faruk G√ºven√ß, also his husband. She played with the orchestra as a solo violinist and a member of the violin group. Since 1986, in addition to her concerts, broadcasts and recording activities, she is professor of violin at the Music and Performing Arts Department of Bilkent University, in Ankara.Biography In 1971, she received the title \\"State Artist\\" from the Turkish government. She was also awarded \\"Chevalier dans l'ordre National du Merite\\" by the Government of France. In 1996 she received the Sevda Cenap And Foundation Golden Medal, a prize offered to the distinctive performers and artists of classical music in Turkey. In 1997, the book \\"Suna Kan: The Violin Heartfeltly Played\\" by M√º≈üerref Hekimoƒülu was published by the same foundation. During her career, she played with giants like Yehudi Menuhin, Andr√© Navarra and Pierre Fournier and received great acclaim for her interpretations from these masters. In her interpretations, Suna Kan combines perfection and balance in a lucid manner that remains far from ostentation. A pioneer in interpreting the works of Turkish symphonic composers written for violin, she played Necil Kazim Akses', Ahmed Adnan Saygun's and Ulvi Cemal Erkin's \\"Violin Concerto\\"s. Kan made few recordings. this is partly because during the most brilliant years of her career, recording business in Turkey was quite inactive. Her few recordings, some of them from live concerts, include Ulvi Cemal Erkin's \\"Violin Concerto\\"s playings with Presidential Symphony Orchestra and Munich Philharmonic and all the violin concertos of Mozart with TRT Ankara Chamber Orchestra. Although she has not gained international popularity that matches her artistic stance as a violinist, she remained in the hearts of a small group of connoisseurs in Turkey as a great virtuoso of a distinctive, special and pure tone.

Distribution The exact distribution differs between sources, but includes at least Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon, and may include the Central African Republic, the Republic of the Congo, and Nigeria. Description They are small, not exceeding , with very short, albeit prehensile, tails. They tend to frequent the ground and low shrubbery in forested areas. This species is capable of color change, but generally in somber shades of tan to gray. It also has a ventral stripe from the eye to above the base of the tail which, however, is not always displayed in lieu of plain ground colors. It is capable of quite striking coloration in the form of streaks and blotches. In spite of their small size, plain color, and often terrestrial habits, they are otherwise very much like the larger chameleons in possessing independently rotating eye sockets, opposable digits on the front and back feet, and projectile tongues. Males may be differentiated from females by their wider tail bases. Behavior They are extremely sedentary, and not territorial (unlike other chameleons). They eat small invertebrates. Their reproductive habits are poorly known. These animals seem to prefer cooler temperatures.

Taylor (born April 20, 1941) is an American billionaire businessman who is the majority owner of the Minnesota Timberwolves NBA basketball team, owner of the Minnesota Lynx WNBA basketball team, owner of the Star Tribune, and a former member of the Minnesota Senate. Taylor is ranked on the Forbes 400, and his company ranks on the Forbes list of America's Largest Private Companies. In 2020, his net worth was reported by Forbes to be $2.5 billion. Early life and education Taylor was born in Springfield, Minnesota, and grew up on a farm in Comfrey, Minnesota. He graduated from Comfrey High School in 1959, and received a bachelor of science in mathematics, physics and social studies from Minnesota State University, Mankato, in 1962. In 1978 he received an executive MBA from Harvard Business School. Career During and after college, Taylor worked at Carlson Wedding Service (later Carlson Craft), a Mankato print shop specializing in formal invitations. In 1975, company owner Bill Carlson wanted to retire, and Taylor offered to pay $2 million over the course of 10 years for the company. The purchase (which he paid off early) formed the basis for the Taylor Corporation, a privately held multinational printing and electronics company with more than 15,000 employees and based in North Mankato, Minnesota. Taylor continues to serve as chairman and CEO.  Politics  Taylor was a Republican Minnesota State Senator from 1981 to 1990, serving as assistant minority leader from 1983 to 1985 and Minority Leader from 1985 to 1988. He considered himself a member of the party's moderate wing.  Sports team ownership  Taylor purchased majority ownership of the Minnesota Timberwolves NBA basketball team in 1994 and purchased the Minnesota Lynx WNBA basketball team in 1999. Taylor was in talks to buy the Minnesota Twins but nothing came of it. In 2000, he was banned for nearly a year for signing Joe Smith to a secret contract in violation of the league's salary cap rules. Before Donald Sterling, Glen Taylor was the only NBA owner to be suspended for more than a couple of games. In 2015, Taylor had a falling out with NBA legend, Kevin Garnett, over a miscommunicated agreement. Garnett had been under the impression that after his retirement from the NBA he would be able to take over ownership of the Minnesota Timberwolves. However, after some discrepancies that was not the case. Taylor and Garnett are no longer on talking terms and Garnett also refuses to have his jersey retired by the Timberwolves after spending 14 seasons of his career there. In 2017, Taylor purchased the Iowa Energy of the NBA Development League (later called NBA G League) and renamed the team the Iowa Wolves as the developmental affiliate of the Timberwolves. He is a past chairman of the board of governors for the NBA serving two terms. (2008-2012),(2014-2017)  Newspaper ownership  In 2014, he purchased the Star Tribune for about $100 million. He told MinnPost that the famously liberal Star Tribune would be decidedly less liberal under his watch, but noted that the paper had already been shifting more to the center in recent years.

SET is ASEAN‚Äôs second largest stock exchange by market capitalization at as of June 2020, but it is crowned as the biggest IPO market in the region with accumulated fund amounting to USD 17.8 billion raised during 2015 to June 2020. SET is also ASEAN‚Äôs most active bourse with the average daily trading turnover of USD 2.16 billion as of June 2020. , SET Focus July 2020 At the end-2019, there were 556 companies listed on SET, 169 on Market for Alternative Investment (mai) and 228 bonds on Thailand Bond Exchange (TBX). Other types of securities including warrant, derivative warrant (DW), depositary receipt (DR), exchange-traded fund (ETF), real estate investment trust (REIT) and infrastructure fund are also listed on SET. SET President Pakorn Peetathawatchai has taken the helm since June 1,2018. Vision SET is aimed to make the capital market as a driving force for the Thai economic growth and to be beneficial to all stakeholders. The objectives are integrated into SET‚Äôs vision ‚ÄúTo Make the Capital Market ‚ÄòWork‚Äô for Everyone‚Äù. History The modern Thai capital market traces its origins back to the early 1960s. In 1961, Thailand implemented its first five-year National Economic and Social Development Plan to promote economic growth and stability as well as develop people‚Äôs standard of living. Subsequently, the Second National Economic and Social Development Plan (1967‚Äì1971) initiated an establishment of Thailand‚Äôs first securities market to play the vital role of mobilizing capital to support the nation‚Äôs economic and industrial development. The modern era of the Thai capital market can be divided into two phases, starting from the privately-owned Bangkok Stock Exchange (BSE) to SET.  The Bangkok Stock Exchange  The first Thai stock exchange was established in July 1962 in the form of a limited partnership. In 1963, the stock exchange was registered as a limited company and its name was changed to the Bangkok Stock Exchange Co., Ltd. (BSE). Although BSE provided a good venue for trading shares, it garnered limited attention. Annual turnover was a mere THB 160 million in 1968 and THB 114 million in 1969. Trading volume continued to drop sharply to THB 46 million in 1970, and then fell further to THB 28 million in 1971. While the turnover in debentures reached THB 87 million in 1972, stock trading continued to perform poorly, with turnover hitting an all- time low of a meagre THB 26 million. BSE finally ceased operations in the early 1970s. BSE‚Äôs failure could be attributed to a lack of government supports and Thais‚Äô limited understanding of equity market at that time.  The Stock Exchange of Thailand  Despite BSE‚Äôs fiasco, the concept regarding the establishment of a well-regulated stock market that had government support received widespread interest from the public. The Second National Economic and Social Development Plan (1967‚Äì1971) therefore proposed the establishment of a capital market for the first time to provide the appropriate measures and tools to facilitate securities trading. In 1969, as recommended by the World Bank, the government appointed Professor Sidney M. Robbins from Columbia University to study the development of the Thai capital market. Professor Robbins had previously served as Chief Economist at the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. The same year proved an eventful one for the Thai capital market, as the Bank of Thailand also formed a working group on capital market development, tasked with establishing the stock market. A year later, in 1970, Professor Robbins produced a comprehensive report entitled \\"A Capital Market in Thailand.\\" This report became the master plan for the future development of the Thai capital market. In 1972, the Thai government took a further step in creating a capital market by amending the \\"Announcement of the Executive Council No. 58 on the Control of Commercial Undertakings Affecting Public Safety and Welfare.\\" The changes extended government control and regulation over the operations of finance and securities companies, which until then had operated fairly freely. Then in May 1974, long-awaited legislation for the incorporation of SET was enacted to provide securities trading in order to promote savings and mobilize domestic capital. This was followed by revisions to the Revenue Code at the end of the year, allowing the investment of savings in the capital market. By 1975 the basic legislative framework was in place and on April 30, 1975, the Securities Exchange of Thailand officially started trading. On January 1, 1991 the name was formally changed to the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET). Roles Roles of the Stock Exchange of Thailand As defined in the Securities and Exchange Act of 1992, the SET's primary roles are: 1\\\\. To serve as the center for the trading of listed securities, and to provide systems needed to facilitate securities trading. 2\\\\. To conduct any business relating to securities trading, such as clearing house, securities depository, securities registrar, and similar activities. 3\\\\. To undertake any other business approved by the SEC. Operations SET is a juristic entity set up under the Securities Exchange of Thailand Act, B.E. 2517 (1974), while operating under the legal framework laid down in the Securities and Exchange Act, B.E. 2535 (1992). SET‚Äôs key operations include securities listing, trading, clearing and settlement, depository, securities trading and information disclosure supervision, market participant protection and information dissemination. SET has actively engaged its stakeholders in promoting sustainability management in the Thai capital market ecosystem to benefit market participants and the general public. As the center of securities trading, SET has been promoting long-term fund-raising among businesses to ensure corporate competitive advantage and benefit the Thai economic growth. In addition, SET has continued to develop financial literacy to enhance well-being of people in society. Business SET provides end-to-end exchange services as follows: ‚Ä¢ Securities market Listing and trading: SET Group provides securities trading service through SET and mai, while offering bond trading service through TBX. Clearing and settlement: SET Group is a clearing house for transactions executed on SET, mai and TBAX. The group also offers the clearing and settlement services for over-the-counter (OTC) bond trading. Depository: SET Group serves as a central securities depository for stocks and bonds, using a secure and efficient scripless system. Market supervision: SET Group supervises trading activities of all investors and brokerage houses to ensure that the market is reliable, transparent and efficient. ‚Ä¢ Derivatives market SET Group operates a derivatives market through Thailand Futures Exchange (TFEX) and supervises trading activities of investors and all derivatives market members. ‚Ä¢ Technology services and capital market infrastructures SET Group offers both front and back office services including front-offer service bureau system, internet trading system, and back-office service bureau system. The group also provides market data services that develop and disseminate stock indices, trading market data and listed companies‚Äô information for data vendors and investors, and the FundConnext ‚Äì a centralized mutual fund platform to connect among asset management companies and selling agents. Moreover, SET Group operates payment system infrastructure called FinNet, which centralizes payment process and sets connecting standards between intermediaries in the capital market and commercial banks. ‚Ä¢ Registrar services SET Group acts as a registrar for equity products and maintain the registrar book that contains accurate and complete shareholder information including their benefits, and connect registrar services with a direct linkage to the Securities Depository Center. Trading=Trading system The SET has operated fully computerized trading since April 1991 through the Automated System for the Stock Exchange of Thailand (ASSET), which enables trading to be efficient, equitable, and fluid. In this trading system, two principal methods of trading are available: Automatic Order Matching (AOM) and Put-Through transactions (PT). In 2012, The SET successfully launched its new trading platform, SET CONNECT. SET CONNECT offers greater capacity and superior transaction speed, and provides the uses of industry standard interfaces, making it easier to accommodate linkage with other marketplaces to attract further liquidity. = Automatic order matching (AOM) = AOM trading performs the order matching process without human intervention. After brokerage houses electronically send buy or sell orders from their offices to the SET mainframe computer, the ASSET system queues the orders and arranges them according to a price-then-time priority. This means orders are first grouped according to price, with the best price taking precedence. Then, within each price group, orders are arranged according to time. In terms of the matching process, there are two methods: continuous order matching and call market method. Continuous Order Matching procedures operate during the regular trading sessions. The ASSET continuously matches the first buy and sell orders in the queue, and at the same time, confirms each executed transaction via the member (broker's) terminal. Call market matching is used in calculating the opening and closing prices of a security at the opening and closing of trading. This method allows brokers to enter their orders to be queued for matching at a specified time at a single price that generates the greatest trading volumes for that particular stock. = Put Through (PT) trading = ASSET also allows brokers to advertise their buy or sell interests by announcing bid or offer prices. Members may then deal directly with each other, either on behalf of their clients or for themselves. Prices may be adjusted during the negotiation; hence, the effective executed price may not be the same as that advertised and may not follow the price spread rules. After concluding negotiations, dealers must send details of the results to ASSET for recording purposes.: Trading hours SET trading is conducted on all bank business days, normally Monday through Friday.

The band's musical influences include Oi!, punk rock, glam rock and rock and roll. They have tended to purposely use low-quality recording techniques (their Acre Studios is a garage). The band recognizes Perry Hardy as their full-time bassist and Chris White as full-time guitarist, even though they do not play on the albums (with the exception of Hardy on two albums). The band currently uses a lineup of four musicians for concerts, with a second guitar player, but still usually records as only a two-piece (with Carl Fritscher playing all bass and guitar parts, as well as vocals with Phil Rigaud on drums). The band's name comes from an ancient order of Christian militants called the Knights Templar. Their focus on Middle Ages history is largely informed by Carl Fritscher (singer/guitarist) and Phil Rigaud's (drummer) studies and interests. A Templars album cover was displayed in a History Channel documentary about the Knights Templar.

Levant was launched on 28 December 1837 by New York Navy Yard; and commissioned on 17 March 1838, with Commander Hiram Paulding in command. Service history=West Indies and Pacific, 1838-1845 Levant sailed from New York on 1 April 1838 for four years‚Äô service in the West Indies Squadron protecting American interests in the Caribbean and South Atlantic. Returning to Norfolk, Virginia, the sloop-of-war decommissioned 26 June 1842. She recommissioned 27 March 1843, Comdr. Hugh N. Page in command, and departed Norfolk to join the Pacific Squadron under Commodore John D. Sloat. From 1843 to 1845 Levant cruised between Panama and Latin American ports carrying diplomats and dispatches and generally furthering American national policy. Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, 1846‚Äì47 With the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War impending, Levant was ordered to the California coast to protect American citizens and property, and was en route when Mexico declared war on 12 May 1846. The sloop arrived off Monterey, California on 1 July, and six days later a landing force from Levant, , and took possession of the recently proclaimed Republic of California. On 23 July, Commodore Sloat relinquished command of the Pacific Squadron because of illness, and sailed 29 July in Levant for the east coast. Upon arriving at Norfolk on 28 April 1847, the sloop was placed in ordinary. Mediterranean, 1852-1855 Levant was recommissioned on 12 July 1852, Comdr. George P. Upshur in command, and sailed for the Mediterranean. When Commander Upshur died on board Levant off Spezia, Italy on 3 November, Comdr. Louis M. Goldsborough, later to win fame in the American Civil War, took command. On 7 April 1853 at Leghorn, Italy, Levant loaded statues by American sculptor Horatio Greenough, including one of George Washington, destined for the Capitol at Washington, D.C. After embarking the U.S. Minister to Turkey and his family at Piraeus, Greece on 24 June, Levant sailed to Constantinople, arriving on 5 July. Returning to Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 29 April 1855, Levant decommissioned at New York Navy Yard on 4 May. East India Squadron, 1855-58 Portsmouth, and Levant, with men and officers from the steam frigate San Jacinto Recommissioned on 31 October, Comdr. William N. Smith in command, Levant sailed on 13 November for Rio de Janeiro, the Cape of Good Hope, and Hong Kong, where she arrived to join the East India Squadron on 12 May 1856. On 1 July she embarked the U.S. Commissioner to China for transportation to Shanghai, arriving 1 August. At the outbreak of hostilities between the British and the Chinese, Levant arrived Whampoa on 28 October. Comdr. Andrew H. Foote then sent a landing party from Levant and his own ship, , to Canton to protect American lives and property there. On 15 November, while in the process of withdrawing this force, Commander Foote was fired on while passing in a small boat by the \\"Barrier Forts\\" on the Pearl River below Canton. On the 16th Levant was towed upriver to join Portsmouth and in keeping the Pearl open to American shipping. As the forts were being strengthened in disregard of American neutrality, Foote was ordered by Commodore James Armstrong, commanding the squadron, \\"to take such measures as his judgment would dictate... even the capture of the forts.\\" Commander Foote complied with all the dash and courage for which he became famous during the Civil War. On 20 November he took the first fort by leading an amphibious assault with 300 men, then silenced the second with cannon captured from the first. Next day he took the third, and by the 24th all four were in American hands and the Pearl once again safe for American shipping. Levant, close in through most of the action, received the major part of the Chinese bombardment, with 22 shot holes in her hull and rigging, one man dead, and six injured. Destruction of the earthworks was completed by 5 December, and Levant cruised between Hong Kong and Shanghai until she departed Hong Kong on 7 December 1857 for home, arriving at the Boston Navy Yard 6 April 1858. Pacific Squadron, 1859-60 After repairs into 1859, Levant, Comdr. William E. Hunt in command, sailed on 15 June for the Pacific, arriving at Valpara√≠so, Chile on 11 October, to serve as Pacific Squadron flagship, wearing Commodore John B. Montgomery's broad pennant, through December. In January 1860 Levant sailed for the coast of Nicaragua, where she relieved and began five months of showing the flag off the coasts of Central and South America. In May 1860, Levant was ordered to the Hawaiian Islands at the request of the Secretary of State to investigate the disbursement of relief funds to American merchant seamen. After receiving a state visit by King Kamehameha IV at Honolulu on 7 May, and investigating at Lahaina, Maui, and Hilo, Hawaii, Levant sailed for Panama on 18 September 1860, but never made port. Disappearance Commodore Montgomery reported that a violent hurricane had occurred in September 1860 in a part of the Pacific Ocean which Levant was to cross. In June 1861, a mast and a part of a lower yardarm believed to be from Levant were found near Hilo. Spikes had been driven into the mast as if to form a raft. Rumors also circulated that she had run aground on an uncharted reef off California. In July 1861, a small bottle was found at Cape Sable Island, Nova Scotia. It was corked and contained a card that read in part: \\"Pacific Ocean\\" \\"Levant\\" \\"Written by the last remaining\\" \\"three\\" \\"in a boat\\" \\"God forgive us\\". Unfortunately, the card was damaged when it was removed from the bottle and parts of the message were unreadable. This card was in the possession of Thomas Willett of Pubnico, Nova Scotia, in 1862, who lost a son aboard this vessel.Yarmouth Herald 30-1-1862 p.3 col.2 courtesy Yarmouth Co. Museum & Archives(How? Further information is needed). On 24 July 1861, the United States Congress passed a law to compensate the widows and orphan children of the officers, seamen, marines and others who were lost with the Levant. The law made a provision for accounts paid and received by the ship's purser, Andrew J. Watson, which were to be settled. The law was included in the \\"Private Acts\\" section of the statutes book.United States. Congress. The Statutes at Large, Treaties and Proclamations of the United States of America, December 5, 1859 to March 3, 1863. Vol. XII. Boston, MA: Little, Brown and Company, 1863, p. 897. The deaths of the officers of Levant were recorded in the Navy Register of 1863 as occurring on 30 June 1861. (This was probably to allow the survivors of the lost men to collect 6 months of their pay as compensation.) Literary reemergence In 1863, when Edward Everett Hale wrote the patriotic short story The Man Without a Country, the announcement of the death of the exiled Philip Nolan while at sea is said to have been while he was aboard the USS Levant on 11 May 1863. In reality, the ship was last heard from in September 1860.

A dyer's son from Krefeld, he was a patriotic young man even while still in school. He began his military career in November 1914 as a 17‚Äëyear‚Äëold Hussar. After turning to aviation, he proved to be a natural pilot. After flight school and six months in a bomber unit, he joined a newly formed fighter squadron, Jagdstaffel 2 on 21 November 1916. There he befriended Manfred von Richthofen. By 6 April 1917, Voss had scored 24 victories and awarded Germany's highest award, the Pour le M√©rite. The medal's mandatory month's leave removed Voss from the battlefield during Bloody April; in his absence, Richthofen scored 13 victories. Nevertheless, Richthofen regarded Voss as his only possible rival as top scoring ace of the war. Soon after Voss returned from leave, he was at odds with his squadron commander. He was detailed from his squadron to evaluate new fighter aircraft and became enthusiastic about the Fokker Triplane. After transferring through three temporary squadron commands in two months, Voss was given command of Jagdstaffel 10 on 30 July 1917 at Richthofen's request. By now, his victory total was 34. His last stand came on 23 September 1917, just hours after his 48th victory. After he fell in solo opposition to eight British aces, he was described by his preeminent foe, James McCudden, as \\"the bravest German airman\\". Early life and entry into military service Werner Voss was born in Krefeld, Germany, on 13 April 1897. His mother, Johanna Mathilde Pastor Voss, was a pious homemaker who raised her children in the Evangelical Lutheran faith. His father Maxmilian owned a dye factory. Werner was soon followed by two brothers; Maxmilian Jr. was born in 1898, and Otto on 22 April 1901. An unusual feature of the Voss household was the presence of two first cousins, Margaret and Katherine. The elder Vosses longed for daughters, so they virtually (if not formally) adopted their nieces. The two nieces were commonly referred to within the family as \\"daughters\\" and \\"sisters\\".Crean 2011, pp. 57‚Äì59. The Voss family home at 75 Blumenthalstrasse was a comfortable two-storey house with surrounding grounds. Young Werner was expected to carry on the family trade as he grew into his heritage.\\"Werner Voss\\" The Blue Max website, 2012. Retrieved: 18 June 2012.Diggens 2003, p. 16. However, even before World War I burgeoned, he was already drawn towards patriotic service. When he finished his schooling at Krefeld's Moltke Gymnasium, he joined the Krefeld Militia. In April 1914, disregarding conscription laws, underaged Werner Voss joined Ersatz Eskadron 2.Diggens 2003, pp. 45‚Äì46. As the war erupted, Voss qualified as a motorcyclist and motorcycle mechanic. He received his \\"Certificate of Graduation\\" as a motorcyclist on 2 August 1914;Crean 2011, p. 45. subsequently, his parents would give him a 300 cc (18.3 cid) Vee-twin Wanderer motorcycle for his 18th birthday.Diggens 2003, second page of photo inserts.Crean 2011, p. 56. After Germany entered World War I, he spent August and September 1914 as a civilian volunteer driver for the German military.Crean 2011, p. 46. The Militia Ersatz Eskadron 2 had been set up to feed recruits to Westphalia's 11th Hussar Regiment. On 16 November 1914, Werner Voss became one of those recruits despite still being only 17 years old. On 30 November, the hussar regiment was ordered to combat duty in the Eastern Front. Military service=From cavalry to the clouds Voss was proficient in his military duties on the Eastern Front. He was promoted to Gefreiter on 27 January 1915, and raised to Unteroffizier, when barely 18 years of age, on 18 May 1915. His service earned him the Iron Cross 2nd Class. He reported to begin officer's training at Camp Beckstadt on 3 June 1915. There he was classified as a reservist because of his flat feet and weak ankles. He graduated on 26 July 1915. Voss transferred to the Luftstreitkr√§fte (German Air Service) on 1 August 1915, joining Fliegerersatz-Abteilung 7 (Training Detachment 7) in Cologne. On 1 September, he began learning to fly at Egelsberg airfield in his hometown of Krefeld. A gifted natural pilot, Voss flew his first solo flight on 28 September. He was retained as an instructor at the training school after he graduated on 12 February 1916. On 2 March, as part of his progress towards becoming an officer, he was promoted to Vizefeldwebel (a senior noncommissioned officer).Franks et al. 1993, pp. 223‚Äì225. He was the youngest flight instructor in German service.Crean 2011, p. 40. Aerial combat See also Aerial victory standards of World War I, List of victories of Werner Voss On 10 March 1916, Voss was posted to Kampfstaffel 20 (Tactical Bomber Squadron 20) of Kampfgeschwader IV (Tactical Bomber Wing IV), and served as an observer before he was allowed to fly as a pilot. In accordance with German custom, he received his pilot's badge on 28 May 1916 after flying actual combat missions.Diggens 2003, pp. 17‚Äì18, 140. Finally commissioned as an officer on 9 September 1916, he transferred to single-seater scout aircraft and was posted to Jagdstaffel 2 (Fighter Squadron 2) on 21 November 1916.VanWyngarden 2004, p. 32. Here Voss began a lifelong friendship with another young pilot in the squadron, Manfred von Richthofen, who would soon gain fame as the Red Baron. They would later exchange family visits while on leave,Franks and VanWyngarden 2001, p. 13. and Richthofen would host the Voss family at his squadron's airfield. The friendship grew from Voss flying as Richthofen's wingman in combat, and disregarded the disparity in their family backgrounds.Diggens 2003, pp. 20‚Äì21. Voss, an avid motorcyclist, had a love of machinery that led him to consort with his enlisted mechanics, Karl Timms and Christian Rueser; he was even on a first name basis with them. In time, they would transfer squadrons to accompany him.Diggens 2003, p. 55. Voss contravened uniform regulations at times and could often be found in the hangar working on his machine beside the mechanics, dressed in a grubby jacket without insignia. His care extended to his craft's exterior; he adorned his Albatros D.III with both a swastika and a heart for good luck.Franks 2000, pp. 17, 92. And although he was a casual dresser around his home airfield, when flying he would be well- dressed with a silk shirt beneath his aviation gear. He joked that he wanted to be presentable to the girls of Paris if he were captured; however, the shirt's silk collar protected his neck from chafing while he swivelled his head about watching for other aircraft during flight.Diggens 2003, p. 39. Voss scored his first aerial victory on the morning of 26 November 1916, and added a second in his afternoon flight. The two victories brought him the Iron Cross First Class, awarded 19 December 1916.Diggens 2003, pp. 28‚Äì29. His first victory of 1917, over Captain Daly, inadvertently taught Voss the knack of deflection shooting. Voss later visited Daly in hospital twice. Voss scored rapidly during February and March 1917; of the 15 victories credited to his Jasta (squadron) during March, 11 fell under his guns.VanWyngarden 2007, pp. 30‚Äì31. For his feats, he was awarded the Knight's Cross with Swords of the House Order of Hohenzollern on 17 March. The following day, Voss downed two British aircraft in ten minutes. The first one burned; the second downed aircrew protested they had been strafed by Voss after crashlanding within German lines. Following his 23rd victory on 1 April, Voss fired upon pilot and plane on the ground after the crash. On 6 April 1917, he staked two victory claims 15 minutes apart, having brought down a two-seater and a Sopwith Pup near one another on either side of the front lines. The two-seater pilot braved both Voss's strafing and incoming German artillery to retrieve aerial photography plates for their military intelligence value. The Sopwith Pup, though later seen with Jasta 2 in German markings after its capture, was an unconfirmed victory despite landing behind German lines.Diggens 2003, pp. 41‚Äì42. Voss was awarded the Pour le M√©rite on 8 April 1917. It was customary to award a month's leave to a Pour le M√©rite winner, so Voss immediately left for his holiday, and did not return to combat until 5 May. By the time of this leave, Voss had gained impressive marksmanship and situational awareness.Franks, Giblin 1997, p. 65.Crean 2011, pp. 149‚Äì150. The timing of the leave allowed him both Easter and his birthday at home. There was a large family reunion; to the family photos, he added a sitting for a formal photo wearing his Pour le M√©rite. He also tinkered with, and roared about upon, his motorcycle. He thus was out of action during Bloody April, the most intense air fighting of the war, when the Luftstreitkr√§fte and its aces inflicted heavy losses on the Royal Flying Corps.Franks 2000, pp. 16‚Äì17. Richthofen, who had scored 11 victories before Voss began his own tally, achieved 13 victories during his absence.Franks et al. 1993, pp. 187‚Äì189. Referring to his \\"dear friend\\", Richthofen stated: \\"He was ... my most redoubtable competitor.\\"Richthofen 2007, p. 126. Upon his return from leave, Voss was dissatisfied with his commanding officer, Franz Walz, whom he considered insufficiently aggressive. Voss shared his sentiments with another Westphalian hussar, Leutnant Rolf Freiherr von Lersner. Walz had assumed command on 29 November 1916, just after Voss joined the Jasta. An older man of 31, he was a prewar pilot and professional soldier who had flown over 300 combat missions in reconnaissance two-seaters before being appointed to command this squadron of fighter pilots. Lacking a background in fighter tactics, he compensated by allowing his more experienced pilots to follow their own inclinations, including solo excursions into British territory. The fact that Walz followed two prior brilliant fighter tacticians in his command‚ÄîOswald Boelcke and Stefan Kirmaier‚Äîonly exposed his weaknesses.Diggens 2003, pp. 20, 22, 55. Voss disregarded military procedure and went outside the chain of command to petition higher headquarters for Walz's removal. Faced with such a case of insubordination, all three men were transferred out of the Jagdstaffel. Lersner was packed off to a bomber unit. Discovering the betrayal, Walz requested reassignment on the grounds that his honor had been impugned. On 20 May 1917, Flight Commander Voss was sent to Jagdstaffel 5 to assume temporary command.Diggens 2003, pp. 55‚Äì56. Voss in command Voss was bequeathed an Albatros D.III in the squadron's insignia. During his brief spell with Jasta 5, Voss scored a further half dozen victories.Diggens 2003, pp. 145‚Äì146. On 9 May 1917, he scored the first of his two \\"hat trick\\" days, downing three Allied aircraft, piloted by Lieutenant Rowland Humphrey Coles, Lieutenant George Copland Temple Hadrill and Lieutenant Charles Mackenzie FurlongerDiggens 2003 However, he was not always successful; he was one of the three German fighters who attacked and seriously damaged Captain Keith Caldwell of 60 Squadron on 28 May 1917, just after Voss's 31st victory, but the wily New Zealander escaped.Crean 2003, p. 213. Voss was slightly wounded on 6 June 1917 by Flight Sub-Lieutenant Christopher Draper, but soon returned to duty.Franks 2000, p. 13. The Royal Naval Air Service credited Draper with an \\"out of control\\" victory; after returning to base, Voss had to trade his damaged Albatros D.III for a fresh one.Crean 2011, pp. 51‚Äì52. Meanwhile, Voss went on leave with Richthofen to Krefeld; surviving photographs portray them exhibiting their aircraft for the Voss clan. Pater familias Maxmilian Voss, Sr. issued an open invitation for Richthofen's use of the Voss family hunting lodge. After this leave,Diggens 2003, pp. 61‚Äì62. on 28 June, Voss took acting command of Jagdstaffel 29. Five days later, he was given temporary command of Jagdstaffel 14.Diggens 2003, pp. 139‚Äì140. Note: The unit histories of both Jasta 29 and Jasta 14 do not list Voss in command. The famous Fokker Triplane of Werner Voss. Its low wing loading gave it manoeuvrability and a high climb rate. Voss was one of the test pilots for the F.I triplane prototype which developed into the Fokker Dr.I. He was summoned to Schwerin, and on 5 July 1917 was one of the first pilots to test fly Fokker F.I s/n 103/17.Crean 2011, p. 44. Although the Fokker had some drawbacks, such as its low speed and slowness in a dive, Voss loved the new craft. It was easy to fly with light controls, could out-manoeuvre any previous aircraft, mounted twin machine guns, and had a rapid rate of climb. The same climbing ability that put it at 1,000 meters (3,000 feet) within three minutes of takeoff lent itself to the combat tactic of zooming upwards out of combat to gain the height advantage on opponents. Voss enthusiastically recommended the Fokker's adoption while never progressing to testing the Pfalz Dr.I. He left Schwerin with an assignment for command of another jasta.Diggens 2003, p. 64. On 30 July, Voss moved to his permanent command of Jagdstaffel 10 in Richthofen's Flying Circus, Jagdgeschwader I (JG I), relieving Ernst Freiherr von Althaus at Richthofen's request. A brand new silvery Pfalz D.III awaited him, but he deemed it inferior to his green Albatros D.V, although he may have scored four victories with the Pfalz.Crean 2011, pp. 52‚Äì54. With his mercurial \\"loner\\" personality, Voss' was impatient with the paperwork and responsibilities of command. However, Oberleutnant Ernst Weigand managed the squadron's daily administration and relieved Voss of those chores. Voss left his staff car parked, and made his official rounds of his aerodrome on his motorcycle. In late August 1917, the rotary engine F.I prototype was assigned to Voss as his personal aircraft. In his childhood, Voss had flown Japanese fighting kites with his cousins in Krefeld; the decorations on the kites gave him the inspiration to paint the nose cowling of his triplane with two eyes, eyebrows and a moustache.Franks and VanWyngarden 2001, p. 12. The arrival of the new fighter brought celebrities visiting. On 31 August, Anthony Fokker escorted German Chancellor Georg Michaelis and Major General Ernst von Lossberg to see and film the new triplane. On 9 September, Crown Prince Wilhelm would also visit Jasta 10.Crean 2011, p. 30. By 11 September 1917, Voss had raised his victory total to 47, second only to the Red Baron's 61.Shores 1983, p. 14. In the process, he had his closest call yet in combat. After shooting down six- victory ace Oscar McMaking, he had in turn been attacked by Captain Norman Macmillan. Macmillan dove his Sopwith Camel within six meters (20 feet) of Voss, machine guns spurting tracers that flew near the German's head. The 45 Squadron ace saw Voss turn his head twice to judge the Camel's position before evading. Then a Royal Aircraft Factory RE.8 blundered across between them, nearly colliding with the Camel and breaking off the attack as Voss dove away. Macmillan claimed an \\"out of control\\" victory when he returned to base.Crean 2011, pp. 152‚Äì153.''' The following day, Voss signed himself out on leave on his authority as Staffelf√ºhrer. His first stop was Berlin, where he was honored receiving an autographed photograph of Kaiser Wilhelm II from the emperor's own hands. From the 15th to the 17th, he was at the Fokker factory in Schwerin; he was accompanied by his girlfriend Ilse. His leave authorization also cleared him for D√ºsseldorf and his hometown of Krefeld, but it is unknown if he visited them. In any case, he returned to duty on 22 September 1917.Crean 2010, pp. 44‚Äì45. Final patrol Voss returned from leave on 23 September 1917 not yet fully rested; as fellow pilot Leutnant Alois Heldmann observed: \\"He had the nervous instability of a cat. I think it would be fair to say he was flying on his nerves.\\"Guttman 2008, p. 21. Nevertheless, Voss flew a morning mission and shot down an Airco DH.4 from 57 Squadron at 09:30 hours. Upon his return to his air base with bullet holes in his Fokker, he took advantage of Richthofen's absence at the Voss family hunting lodgeBodenschatz 1996, p. 32. to celebrate with a victory loop before landing. In contrast to Voss's usual tidy flying garb, he was wearing striped gray trousers, a dirty gray sweater, and tall lace-up boots.Crean 2011, pp. 7‚Äì13. Just before Werner landed, brothers Max and Otto Voss arrived at Jasta 10 for a visit. They were both now in the German military. Otto was a 19-year- old army leutnant bucking for an opportunity to become a flier like his elder brother. Max Jr. was a 16-year-old sergeant.Crean 2011, pp. 57‚Äì58. Voss was fatigued and told his brothers he was looking forward to more time off. He ate lunch with his brothers‚Äîsoup, black bread, coffee, and cake. His brothers noted his haggard appearance, apparent in his final photographs. After the meal, the three posed before Werner Voss's camera, which was equipped with a timed shutter release. Then Voss was scheduled for another patrol. Even as the brothers were in their photo session, on the other side of the lines 56 Squadron was mustering for its own afternoon patrols. 'B' Flight was led by Captain James McCudden. In Royal Flying Corps fashion, his Royal Aircraft Factory SE5a serial number B4863 was marked with a large initial G painted upon the side of its fuselage. He would be followed by two other aces: Captain Keith Muspratt in SE5a A8944, designated H; Lieutenant Arthur Rhys-Davids in SE5a number B525, lettered I. Three other pilots were also attached to B Flight for this sortie‚ÄîLieutenants V. P. Cronyn in SE5a A4563, as well as R. W. Young, and Charles Jeffs. Diggens 2003, pp. 79‚Äì80. Also mustering for patrol was the Squadron's 'C' Flight, led by Captain Geoffrey Hilton Bowman. His SE5a was followed by Lieutenant Reginald Hoidge in SE5a B506, lettered J. A third ace, Lieutenant Richard Maybery in SE5a B1 designated K, was also in 'C' Flight. Lieutenants E. A. Taylor and S. J. Gardiner filled out the flight's roster.Diggens 2003, p. 80. Both flights of 56 Squadron took off from their side of the trench lines at 1700 hours. They climbed into a sky overhung with a 300-meter-thick (1,000 feet) cloud ceiling at 2,700 meters (9,000 feet) altitude, and crossed the lines over Bixschoote at 2,400 meters (8,000 feet). McCudden later noted there were lower scattered layered skeins of clouds, but horizontal visibility was fair. On the other hand, he saw ground visibility was veiled by haze. He also noted friendly aircraft swarming to the North as his flight approached the Battle of Passchendaele zone.McCudden 2009, pp. 198‚Äì199. At this time there were elements of at least eight different Royal Flying Corps squadrons waging its offensive campaign over this battlefield area.Crean 2003, p. 161. There was also considerable enemy air activity to the East, where German jastas waited for \\"the customers to come into the shop\\". The overcast conditions compressed aerial activity to lower levels instead of allowing its usual altitude range to about 6,000 meters (20,000 feet). German anti-aircraft fire was noted as heavy and accurate, as 'B' and 'C' Flights diverged onto separate patrol routes at Houthoulst Forest. As 'B' Flight's patrol continued, McCudden swooped on a German DFW and shot it down at 18.00 hours; Rhys-Davids giving it a parting burst of machine-gun fire as it fell past him earthbound.Diggens 2003, pp. 79‚Äì82, 122. On the German side of the lines, Voss had changed clothing. He wore a colourful civilian silk dress shirt beneath his unbuttoned knee-length brown leather coat. His polished brown boots shone from below the coat's hem. His Pour le M√©rite was at his throat. He was to lead one of the two scheduled afternoon patrols. Leutnant Gustav Bellen was his righthand wingman; Leutnant Friedrich R√ºdenberg had Voss's other side.Crean 2011, pp. 7‚Äì13.Crean, Thomas. \\"The Last Stand.\\" Let Let Let Warplanes, 19 June 2008. Retrieved: 20 July 2013. After takeoff at 18:05 hours,Bodenschatz 1996, p. 152. Voss, with his new Fokker Triplane, advanced its throttle and soon outdistanced his two wingmen flying slower Pfalz D.IIIs. A few minutes later, Oberleutnant Ernst Weigand in Albatros D.V number 1187/17 led a second flight skyward; three Pfalz D.IIIs followed him, piloted by Leutnants Erich L√∂wenhardt, Alois Heldmann, and Max Kuhn. None of these Jasta 10 aircraft would ever catch up with their Staffelf√ºhrer.Crean, Thomas. \\"The Last Stand.\\" Let Let Let Warplanes, 19 June 2008. Retrieved: 20 July 2013. The dogfight developed over Poelkapelle at about 18:30 hours. The Germans chasing Voss found themselves stalemated by British Sopwith Camels, as well as some SPADs and Bristol F.2 Fighters patrolling under the overcast. Two flights of the elite 56 Squadron formed a lower layer of British patrols at 1,800 meters (6,000 feet) altitude. Below that, Lieutenant Harold A. Hamersley, flying as a rear guard to his squadronmates in 60 Squadron, had a wary eye on a nearby enemy formation of 20 to 25 German aircraft.Diggens 2003, p. 82. At about 18:25 hours, he turned to help what he believed to be a Nieuport threatened by a German Albatros, firing a short burst of machine-gun fire to distract the German. The \\"Nieuport\\", Voss's misidentified Fokker Triplane, rounded on Hamersley and raked him with Spandau fire. Hamersley flung his Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5a into a spin that went inverted, with Voss continuing to fire at him, holing his wings and engine cowling. Lieutenant Robert L. Chidlaw-Roberts, a squadronmate of Hamersley, rushed to his aid. Within seconds, Voss shredded Chidlaw-Roberts's rudder bar, also driving him out of the fray into a forced landing. McCudden's upgraded & re- tuned SE.5a. The SE.5a's speed of 205 km/h (130 mph) made it much faster than the Fokker Triplane. McCudden retuned the engine for high altitude performance. While they fell away seriously shot about, and the rest of 60 Squadron exited the scene, Voss was engaged by 'B' Flight of 56 Squadron, in their SE.5as. Captain McCudden and his wingmen attacked in pairs from 300 meters (1,000 feet) above Voss. In a pincer movement, McCudden hooked into an assault from the right while his wingman, Lieutenant Arthur Rhys Davids, swooped in from the left. Muspratt trailed them down, while Cronyn brought up the rear. Jeffs and Young held high as top-cover in case Voss climbed. Voss now found himself boxed in from above and below, with assailants pouncing from either side. To further worsen Voss's situation, there was a British fighter patrol beneath him. To the attackers' surprise, Voss did not try to escape the trap. Instead, he flicked his tri-plane about in a flat spin and fired at his attackers in a head-on firing pass, holing McCudden's wings. Voss then riddled Cronyn's SE.5 from close range, putting him out of the dogfight. Cronyn had to turn in under his attacker and throw his aircraft into a spin to escape being killed. His wing-mates then attacked Voss, while Cronyn also limped for home.Diggens 2003, pp. 84‚Äì85. At this point 'C' Flight arrived. As it dipped down through the overcast toward the dogfight, Gardiner and Taylor went astray. Maybery was attacked by a green Pfalz D.III. Hoidge's counter-attack foiled the German. Bowman and Maybery remained to join the attack on Voss. Hoidge, having broken off his pursuit of the falling Pfalz, changed the drum magazine in his Lewis gun, and climbed to join battle.Diggens 2003, pp. 85‚Äì86. Voss in his tri-plane zigzagged, yawed, and bobbed among his multiple attackers, never holding a straight course for more than seconds, evading British fire and spewing bullets at them all individually. The combat now became so frenetic that the surviving pilots later gave widely varying accounts.Diggens 2003, p. 87. However, certain events were commonly related: Muspratt's engine lost its coolant to a Spandau bullet early on; he glided away from the fight with the engine beginning to seize. At some point, a red- nosed Albatros D.V made a short-lived attempt to help Voss, but Rhys-Davids succeeded in putting a bullet through its engine and it dropped out of the fight.Diggens 2003, pp. 86, 118. Note: Until the recent discovery of Carl Menckhoff's memoirs, it was believed that he piloted this Albatros: see . At another point, Voss was caught in a crossfire by at least five of his attackers but appeared to be miraculously unaffected by the fire. At about this point, Maybery withdrew with his aircraft's upper right-hand longeron holed in several places. Voss and the six remaining British aces swirled down to 600 meters (2,000 feet). At times Voss had altitude advantage over his attackers, but apparently did not attempt to escape the situation, despite the odds against him. Using the tri-plane's superior rate of climb and its ability to slip turn he managed to evade his opponents, and plunged down back into the melee. He continued to flick turn at high speeds and counter-attack any aircraft pursuing him. As Bowman later noted concerning his only shot at Voss: \\"'To my amazement he kicked on full rudder, without bank, pulled his nose up slightly, gave me a burst while he was skidding sideways and then kicked on opposite rudder before the results of this amazing stunt appeared to have any effect on the controllability of his machine.\\"Guttman 2008, p. 22. Bowman's machine was left slowed and ineffectively trailing dark smoke and steam, though he stayed in the fight. Death Then, after flying at McCudden in a head-on machine-gun firing merge by both pilots, Voss' aircraft was suddenly struck by a starboard broadside burst of machine-gun fire from Hoidge, who was probably unsighted by Voss at that moment, and after this it was noticed that Voss stopped manoeuvring and flew level for the first time in the engagement. At this moment Rhys Davids, who had pulled aside to change an ammunition drum, rejoined the battle with a 150-meter (500 foot) height advantage over Voss's altitude of 450 meters (1,500 feet), and began a long flat dive on to the tail of Voss' tri-plane, which Voss's aircraft failed to react to. At point-blank range he raked Voss' aircraft with his machine-guns before breaking off. A few seconds on Voss's aircraft wandered into Rhys Davids line of flight again in a strangely becalmed slow westward glide, Rhys Davids again firing an extended burst into it causing its engine to stop, the two aircraft missing a mid-air collision by inches. As the tri-plane's glide steepened, Rhys Davids overran him at about 300 meters (1,000 feet) altitude and lost sight of Voss's aircraft beneath his. From above, Bowman saw the Fokker in what could have been a landing glide, right up until it stalled. It then flipped inverted and nose down, dropping directly to earth. The resulting smash left only the rudder intact. McCudden, watching from 900 meters (3,000 feet), recalled: \\"I saw him go into a fairly steep dive and so I continued to watch, and then saw the tri-plane hit the ground and disappear into a thousand fragments, for it seemed to me that it literally went into powder.\\"Crean 2011, p. 194.Richthofen 2007, p. 19. There would be debate later whether Voss dropped out of the inverted triplane. Voss had fought the British aces for around eight minutes, eluding them and achieving hits on nearly every SE.5a.Shores 1983, p. 17.Franks and VanWyngarden 2001, pp. 16‚Äì19. His stricken aircraft crashed near Plum Farm to the North of Frezenberg in Belgium at about 18:40 hours.Franks and VanWyngarden 2001, p. 19. Aftermath=British reaction Lieutenant Verschoyle Phillip Cronyn later described his harrowing return flight. Being the rare targeted pilot to escape Voss's gun fire, he now had to coax home a failing machine destined for the scrapheap. He lost control of it banking for the landing pattern, and finally performed a desperate high speed landing at 18:40 hours, approximately coincidental with the triplane's impact. The 56 Squadron commander, Major Blomfield, led the shaky-kneed pilot from his machine to a bench and plied him with medicinal brandy. Cronyn's composure broke. After a fit of weeping,Crean 2011, p. 174. he pulled himself together as McCudden landed, followed by Rhys-Davids. The latter exited his machine hyperventilating and stammering. He got his tot of brandy, and uttered an account jumbled by his excitement.Diggens 2003, p. 100.Crean 2011, pp. 173‚Äì174. With the exception of Muspratt, who had landed at the 1 Squadron aerodrome with a seized engine, the rest of 56 Squadron landed back at Estr√©e- Blanche. Combat reports by the pilots were written and submitted; those from McCudden, Rhys-Davids, Bowman, Maybery, Hoidge, and Gardiner still exist.Diggens 2003, 122‚Äì128. These fragmentary written documents would be supplemented by McCudden's autobiography, written before his death the following year;Crean 2011, pp. 193‚Äì194. contradictory written accounts produced by Chidlaw-Roberts and Bowman in 1942;Diggens 2003, pp. 133‚Äì136. and Cronyn's memoirs of 1976.Cronyn 1976 . When corresponding with aviation historian Evan Hadingham in 1967, Cronyn offered, \\"... movements were purely instinctive, and made on such split second action that no impression was recorded.\\" He offered as example that he was unaware he had spent most of his fight with Voss flying inverted until Muspratt mentioned it in the mess the evening of the fight.Diggens 2003, p. 95. The 56 Squadron mess atmosphere that night was muted, with speculation about the identity of their fallen opponent. The names Richthofen, Voss, and Wolff were bruited. Rhys-Davids was besieged with congratulations, which he received modestly with a disclaimer of, \\"If I only could have brought him down alive.\\" A standing toast was drunk to their gallant fallen foe.Diggens 2003, p. 90. The following day, 24 September 1917, a British patrol reached the crash site. Documents in Voss' pocket identified him. A military doctor cursorily examined the corpse. He noted three bullet wounds. One ranged slightly upward through the chest cavity from right to left, consistent with Hoidge's angle of fire; it would have killed Voss in less than a minute. The other two gunshot wounds pierced Voss's abdomen from rear to front, coinciding with Rhys-Davids's firing angle.Crean 2011, pp. 19‚Äì20. Werner Voss was buried like any other dead soldier near Plum Farm, laid in a shell crater without coffin or honors. His grave's location was recorded as Map Sheet 28, coordinates 24.C.8.3.Crean 2011, p. 20. The field grave would subsequently be lost trace of, through the turmoil of ongoing ground fighting.Crean 2011, p. 18. That same day, Aide de Camp Maurice Baring was sent by Major General Hugh Trenchard to gather such military intelligence as he could about the dogfight. Baring interviewed McCudden, Maybery, Hoidge, and Rhys-Davids. McCudden laconically reported his observation of the crash location being near Zonnebeke. Maybery insisted he saw two triplanes in the fight, a grey one and a green one, in addition to a green German scout and a rednosed German scout. Hoidge never saw the rednosed Albatros. Rhys-Davids said the dogfight began when a red-nosed Albatros, a green German scout, and a grey and brown Triplane attacked an SE.5. He aso insisted that the triplane mounted four guns, and thought it had a stationary engine instead of a rotary engine. Subsequent accounts of Voss's last stand would partially depend on such \\"facts\\" drawn from Baring's inquiries.Crean 2011, pp. 20‚Äì21. Rhys-Davids, in a letter home written on 25 September mentioning his victory claim, did not know the name of his victim. However, another letter of the 28th mentioned Voss by name.Crean 2011, p. 197. Also, on 28 September, after five days as a nonflying orderly officer, V. P. Cronyn was shipped off to another noncombat post with combat fatigue, a belated casualty. On 1 October 1917, the British Headquarters in France and Belgium finally posted a press release to the Associated Press announcing \\"... Lieut. Vosse ... has been found within the British lines, and British airmen have already dropped messages behind the German front, giving notification of his death.\\" In conformity with British Army policy, credit was given only to \\"... a British airman.\\"Diggens 2003, pp. 100‚Äì101. By 5 October, Rhys-Davids's letter to his mother boasted of his souvenir rudder and compass salvaged from the triplane wreckage.Crean 2011, p. 22. On 27 October, the same day Rhys-Davids died in action,Shores et al. 1990, pp. 318‚Äì319. a British intelligence officer finally gained access to the wreckage after it had lain a month in the open. He verified it was a triplane, and noted that its upper surfaces were camouflage green and its bottom surfaces were blue. Second Lieutenant Barfoot-Saunt removed some small pieces from the wreck to accompany his report, illustrating technical points. The technical information that was reported gave the British their first insight into the new craft, although Voss had swapped in a French Le Rhone engine.Crean 2003, pp. 18, 22. German reaction Leutnants R√ºdenberg and Bellen had returned to base, as had the rest of the Jasta 10 pilots. The only one with news was Heldmann, who reported Voss headed toward British lines while pursued by a British SE.5. Timm and Rueser waited anxiously for his return as the sun set. The fact that Voss was missing in action was communicated to wing headquarters; telephone queries were made of all friendly airfields within range. Late that night, a German frontline unit reported seeing six British machines shoot down a lone German aircraft that fell within the British trenches.Diggens 2003, p. 91. Heldmann refused to believe Voss was killed in aerial combat; he claimed Voss had to have been shot after crawling from the wreckage.Diggens 2003, pp. 103‚Äì104. On 24 September, Jasta 10 pilots dropped a note inquiring about Voss attached to a black, white, and red streamer over British lines.Crean 2011, p. 163. By 25 September, two days after the fight, the Niederrheinische Volkszeitung ran a notice of Voss's death. That same day, Jasta 10 lost its second commander in three days, when Weigand was killed in action.Diggens 2003, p. 110. On 7 October 1917, the Krefelder Zeitung ran a page of tributes to Werner Voss from such luminaries as Crown Prince Wilhelm, Anthony Fokker, and Generalleutnant Ernst von Hoeppner.Diggens 2003, p. 101. On 11 October 1917, Bellen was invalided from the ranks of Jasta 10. In November, R√ºdenberg was released from active duty to pursue his studies at university. Aviation historians such as Douglas Whetton posited these reassignments were retribution for failure to aid Voss in his dogfight.Diggens 2003, p. 105. Legacy When the British aces of 56 Squadron learned their fallen foe's identity, they were quick to pay public tribute to him. The leading British pilot he fought that day, James McCudden VC, expressed sincere regret at Voss's death: \\"His flying was wonderful, his courage magnificent and in my opinion he was the bravest German airman whom it has been my privilege to see fight.\\"McCudden 2009, p. 200. In later years, Voss would not be forgotten. Because his grave site was lost, Werner Voss is one of 44,292 German soldiers memorialised in the Langemark German war cemetery, some 3.7 miles northeast of Ypres, Belgium.Langemark Memorial www.findagrave.com, 2013.

Retrieved: 5 September 2013. Still enduring is the debate as to why Voss chose to fight on against clearly almost impossible odds rather than disengage from the action. However, it is possible that he wanted to close the kill gap between himself and the Red Baron, by shooting down some British aircraft, so he stayed on. Although Voss's apparent refusal to retreat is not mentioned in the contemporary English combat reports, nor in McCudden's autobiography written in June and July 1918, McCudden is credited with the observation that Voss seemingly rejected several opportunities to disengage and withdraw from the tactically grave situation in which he found himself. In 1942 Hector Bolitho and James Ira Thomas Jones received letters from both Chidlaw-Roberts and Bowman concerning their recall of Voss's last stand. Bowman read and savaged the Chidlaw-Roberts account for its inaccuracies, although his own account had obvious errors. At the same time Bowman also stated that he believed Voss had an opportunity to disengage and save himself, but had deliberately chosen instead to fight in spite of the overwhelmingly unequal situation with which he was faced. This is the earliest positively identified historical source for the assertion that Voss rejected chances for a safe retreat that were open to him. The dogfight remains a subject of debate and controversy among combat aviation historians and interested parties.Diggens 2003, pp. 132‚Äì137. References=NotesBibliography * Bodenschatz, Karl.

Biography While an engineer with Jeffery Mining and Manufacturing Company (later part of Dresser Industries) of Columbus, Ohio, Dierdorff developed insulation that could be packed around electric motor housings to suppress sparking found on early electrical motors. This allowed the first safe electric seam cutting tool in underground mining. This tool was capable of cutting anthracite coal and was known as the Congo Coal Cutter after its success for the Congo Mining Company, of Corning, Ohio. Between 1885 and 1909, Dierdorff designed and secured thirty-five patents from the United States Patent Office related to mining and mining safety. One of his most widely used patents involved the development of power systems (spark suppressive) to deliver electricity to miners underground, resulting in the first safe delivery of electric light to miners working underground. At the time of his retirement from Jeffery, Dierdorff oversaw the company's entire manufacturing facilities and processes. Dierdorff was born near Seville in Medina County, Ohio in 1851. Dierdorff married twice; first to Charlotte Miller (five children) and then to Hattie Monnette. He died in Columbus, Ohio in 1935 and is buried in Greenlawn Cemetery, Columbus, Ohio.

Each knowledge source updates the blackboard with a partial solution when its internal constraints match the blackboard state. In this way, the specialists work together to solve the problem. The blackboard model was originally designed as a way to handle complex, ill-defined problems, where the solution is the sum of its parts. Metaphor The following scenario provides a simple metaphor that gives some insight into how a blackboard functions: > A group of specialists are seated in a room with a large blackboard. They > work as a team to brainstorm a solution to a problem, using the blackboard > as the workplace for cooperatively developing the solution. The session > begins when the problem specifications are written onto the blackboard. The > specialists all watch the blackboard, looking for an opportunity to apply > their expertise to the developing solution. When someone writes something on > the blackboard that allows another specialist to apply their expertise, the > second specialist records their contribution on the blackboard, hopefully > enabling other specialists to then apply their expertise. This process of > adding contributions to the blackboard continues until the problem has been > solved. Components A blackboard-system application consists of three major components # The software specialist modules, which are called knowledge sources (KSs). Like the human experts at a blackboard, each knowledge source provides specific expertise needed by the application. # The blackboard, a shared repository of problems, partial solutions, suggestions, and contributed information. The blackboard can be thought of as a dynamic \\"library\\" of contributions to the current problem that have been recently \\"published\\" by other knowledge sources. # The control shell, which controls the flow of problem-solving activity in the system. Just as the eager human specialists need a moderator to prevent them from trampling each other in a mad dash to grab the chalk, KSs need a mechanism to organize their use in the most effective and coherent fashion. In a blackboard system, this is provided by the control shell. Learnable Task Modeling Language A blackboard system is the central space in a multi-agent system. It's used for describing the world as a communication platform for agents. To realize a blackboard in a computer program, a machine readable notation is needed in which facts can be stored. One attempt in doing so is a SQL database, another option is the Learnable Task Modeling Language (LTML). The syntax of the LTML planning language is similar to PDDL, but adds extra features like control structures and OWL-S models. LTML was developed in 2007 as part of a much larger project called POIROT (Plan Order Induction by Reasoning from One Trial), which is a Learning from demonstrations framework for process mining. In POIROT, Plan traces and hypotheses are stored in the LTML syntax for creating semantic web services. Here is a small example: A human user is executing a workflow in a computer game. He presses some buttons and interacts with the game engine. While he is doing so, a plan trace is created. That means the user's actions are stored in a logfile. The logfile gets transformed into a machine readable notation which is enriched by semantic attributes. The result is a textfile in the LTML syntax which is put on the blackboard. Agents (software programs in the blackboard system) are able to parse the LTML syntax. Implementations Famous examples of early academic blackboard systems are the Hearsay II speech recognition system and Douglas Hofstadter's Copycat and Numbo projects. More recent examples include deployed real-world applications, such as the PLAN component of the Mission Control System for RADARSAT-1,Corkill, Daniel D. \\"Countdown to success: Dynamic objects, GBB, and RADARSAT-1.\\" Communications of the ACM 40.5 (1997): 48-58. an Earth observation satellite developed by Canada to monitor environmental changes and Earth's natural resources. GTXImage CAD software by GTX Corporation was developed in the early 1990s using a set of rulebases and neural networks as specialists operating on a blackboard system. Adobe Acrobat Capture (now discontinued) used a Blackboard system to decompose and recognize image pages to understand the objects, text, and fonts on the page. This function is currently built into the retail version of Adobe Acrobat as \\"OCR Text Recognition\\". Details of a similar OCR blackboard for Farsi text are in the public domain.Khosravi, H., & Kabir, E. (2009). A blackboard approach towards integrated Farsi OCR system. International Journal of Document Analysis and Recognition (IJDAR), 12(1), 21-32. Blackboard systems are used routinely in many military C4ISTAR systems for detecting and tracking objects.  Criticism  Blackboard systems were popular before the AI Winter and, along with most symbolic AI models, fell out of fashion during that period. Along with other models it was realised that initial successes on toy problems did not scale well to real problems on the available computers of the time. Most problems using blackboards are inherently NP-hard, so resist tractable solution by any algorithm in the large size limit. During the same period, statistical pattern recognition became dominant, most notably via simple Hidden Markov Models outperforming symbolic approaches such as Hearsay-II in the domain of speech recognition. Recent developments Blackboard-like systems have been constructed within modern Bayesian machine learning settings, using agents to add and remove Bayesian network nodes. In these 'Bayesian Blackboard' systems, the heuristics can acquire more rigorous probabilistic meanings as proposal and acceptances in Metropolis Hastings sampling though the space of possible structures.Sutton C. A Bayesian Blackboard for Information Fusion, Proc. Int. Conf. Information Fusion, 2004 Conversely, using these mappings, existing Metropolis-Hastings samplers over structural spaces may now thus be viewed as forms of blackboard systems even when not named as such by the authors. Such samplers are commonly found in musical transcription algorithms for example.Godsill, Simon, and Manuel Davy. \\"Bayesian harmonic models for musical pitch estimation and analysis.\\" Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2002 IEEE International Conference on. Vol. 2. IEEE, 2002. Blackboard systems have also been used to build large-scale intelligent systems for the annotation of media content, automating parts of traditional social science research. In this domain, the problem of integrating various AI algorithms into a single intelligent system arises spontaneously, with blackboards providing a way for a collection of distributed, modular natural language processing algorithms to each annotate the data in a central space, without needing to coordinate their behavior.

It was then partially remixed and re-released in November 1969, but at no time has the album ever charted on the Billboard 200. Release history The first release used the Haeco-CSG encoding system. This technology was intended to make stereo records compatible with mono record players, but had the unfortunate side effect of degrading the sound. Young was unhappy with the first release. \\"The first mix was awful\\", he was reported as saying in Cash Box of September 6, 1969. \\"I was trying to bury my voice, because I didn't like the way it sounded.\\" The album was therefore remixed (as announced in Rolling Stone issue 47, from December 13), and re-released without Haeco-CSG processing. The words \\"Neil Young\\" were added to the album cover after what was left of the original stock had been used up, so copies of both mixes exist in the original sleeve. Copies of the original mix are now rare and sought-after, because many Neil Young fans believe that the remix diminished the songs, especially \\"Here We Are in the Years\\". Neil Young was remastered and released on HDCD-encoded compact discs and digital download on July 14, 2009 as part of the Neil Young Archives Original Release Series. It was released on audiophile vinyl in December 2009, both individually and as part of a box-set of Neil's first four LPs available via his official website. This box set was limited to 1000 copies; a CD version of 3000 copies also exists. A high resolution digital Blu-ray disc is planned, although no release date has been set. On April 4, 2019, the first release using the Haeco-CSG encoding system was made available to stream for one week to non-subscribers and for all time to subscribers on the Neil Young Archives website.

It was characterized in 1972 and 1973 by Renate Pickardt and Rudolf Fahlbusch. Cause Interruption of the portal system may be caused by tumors compressing the infundibulum. Other causes for Pickardt's syndrome are inflammatory disorders and traumatic brain injury. An inborn variant of Pickardt's syndrome that is associated with certain mutations (HESX1 or LHX4) is referred to as pituitary stalk interruption syndrome (PSIS). Endocrine consequences Typical manifestations of Pickardt‚ÄìFahlbusch syndrome are hypothyroidism with reduced TSH values and functional hyperprolactinemia (which is caused by disinhibition of prolactin release). Other endocrine disorders that are usually associated with Pickardt syndrome are suprasellar failures like secondary hypogonadism, reduced levels of growth hormone and, in more severe cases, secondary adrenal insufficiency. Diagnosis Pickardt's syndrome may cause difficulties in differential diagnosis of pituitary adenomas, as both suprasellar hormone-inactive adenomas and prolactinomas may be associated with increased prolactin levels, central hypogonadism and central hypothyroidism. Usually, the prolactin levels are higher in case of a true prolactinoma, but the concentration ranges overlap. Treatment Treatment modality depends on the cause. Tumors may be removed surgically, but pituitary stalk interruption may persist. Usually, replacement of those hormones that are reduced due to failed feedback control systems will be necessary.

Serving Years 9 to 13, Rangitoto has a school roll of as of making it the largest \\"brick-and-mortar\\" school in New Zealand (only The Correspondence School is larger, with students). Patrick Gale is the current principal. Location Rangitoto College is located in Mairangi Bay, on the East Coast Bays on Auckland's North Shore. The easternmost field as well as many of the classrooms on the eastern side of the school have a view of the Rangitoto Channel as well as Rangitoto Island. History Rangitoto College opened in February 1956, with an initial roll of 180 Year 9 and 10 students (then known as Forms 3 and 4). A block and D block are the school's two original buildings; these are standard school buildings of the \\"1950s Single Storey\\" type, with long single-storey blocks of classrooms orientated east-west with a corridor connecting the classrooms on the south side. Enrolment Like many secondary schools in Auckland, Rangitoto operates an enrolment scheme to help curb roll numbers and prevent overcrowding. Rangitoto's enrolment zone, in which students residing are automatically entitled to be enrolled without rejection, covers approximately , and includes Browns Bay, Campbells Bay, Mairangi Bay, Murrays Bay, Pinehill, Rothesay Bay, Sunset North, and Windsor Park, and parts of Meadowood and Rosedale east of the Auckland Northern Motorway. Students residing outside the zone are accepted as roll places allow per the enrollment scheme order of preference and secret ballot. At the September 2015 Education Review Office (ERO) review of the school, the school had 2871 students enrolled, including 258 international students. The school roll's gender composition was evenly split between male and female, and its ethnic composition was 45% New Zealand European (PƒÅkehƒÅ), 11% Chinese, 6% African, 7% MƒÅori, 2% South East Asian, 1% Indian, 1% Pacific Islanders, 12% other European, 11% other Asian, and 3% other. Rangitoto College has a socio-economic decile rating of 10 (step Z), meaning it draws its school community from areas of highest socio-economic strata when compared to other New Zealand schools. Recent principals In mid-2005, principal Allan Peachey stood down in order to stand as a National Party candidate for election to Parliament. Alison Cleland took over as principal in the interim. As a result of Peachey's election as the Member of Parliament for the Tamaki electorate, David Hodge, a former student at Rangitoto College, was appointed as Principal in 2006, but left in 2017. Patrick Gale is the current principal. Academic performance Rangitoto College is a decile 10 school, meaning that, as the ERO (Education Review Office) puts it, Rangitoto draws its students from an area of 'least socio- economic disadvantage'. The data show that it performs at, or above, the average level for decile 10 schools nationally. Like other decile 10 schools, Rangitoto performs better than schools from areas of greater socio-economic disadvantage. Compared to the national average, Rangitoto students achieved very good results in the 2008 New Zealand Scholarship exams. 2. Prior to Bursary being replaced by the National Certificate of Educational Achievement Rangitoto had at least one student recognised as New Zealand's top scholar in a subject between 2001 and 2003; in 2003 Rangitoto had three four top-scholars including Top all-round Female MƒÅori Scholar. 5. In 2006 a Rangitoto College student was named \\"Top Scholar in New Zealand\\" for the subject of history in 2006 based on the NCEA framework. In 2013, 94.4 percent of students leaving Rangitoto College held at least NCEA Level 1, 89.5 percent held at least NCEA Level 2, and 76.3 percent held at least University Entrance. This is compared to 85.2%, 74.2%, and 49.0% respectively for all students nationally.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is an active Anglican parish church. History The circular shape of the churchyard suggests that a church was on the site before the Norman Conquest, and parts of the existing fabric in the chancel and north vestry date possibly from the 15th century. The church was largely rebuilt in 1610. The tower was built in 1729 and the spire added in 1797. The tower and spire were designed by Henry Sephton, the spire being rebuilt after a lightning strike. The aisles were widened between 1817 and 1819, a restoration took place in 1876, and the south vestry was added in 1900. In 1953 the aisles were rebuilt. Architecture The church is built in red sandstone. Its plan consists of a west tower, a nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles and a chancel with north and south vestries. The tower has a west entrance with a three-light window above and an inscribed frieze. The bell stage has Doric flat pilasters and an entablature, 2-light louvred bell openings, and clock faces. The parapet has a balustrade and three finials to each angle, and the spire has three tiers of lucarnes. The aisles have cornices and embattled parapets. Internally are five-bayed arcades. Stone plaques on the walls carry the arms and sometimes the initials of the 1610 benefactors. The stalls, with poppyhead carving, are dated 1636. The reredos is of panelled timber, dated 1891 and designed by Kempe. There are two fonts, one Norman and simple on a modern base, the other, which was donated in 1755, was previously an Italian marble stoup. The chancel screen is dated 1921. The stained glass includes some in the south aisle by Morris & Co. There are a number of monuments, including one dated 1803 by Sir Richard Westmacott, and a brass dated 1836 which was designed by A. W. N. Pugin. External features The churchyard contains the war graves of 24 service personnel, 22 of World War I and two of World War II.

He wrote and drew Dan Dare's Venus and Red Moon stories, plus a complete storyline for Operation Saturn. However, Hampson drew only part of the Saturn story and his script was altered when he passed the strip to assistants. Between 1964 and 1970 he also illustrated ten books for Ladybird Books, including Nursery Rhymes, Kings and Queens, and Peter and Jane. Biography Hampson was born at 488 Audenshaw Road, Audenshaw, near to Manchester (now Tameside), and was educated at King George V School, a grammar school in Southport. His brother Eric was killed in a naval action during the Second World War. He married Dorothy Mabel Jackson in 1944 and in 1947 they had a son, Peter. In 1949, in collaboration with Christian vicar Rev. Marcus Morris, he devised a new children's magazine, the Eagle, which Morris took to the Hulton Press. In April the following year, a revised version of the Eagle hit the bookstalls. Its most popular strip was Hampson's creation Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future. Like Alex Raymond and Milton Caniff in the U.S., Hampson instituted a studio system where, from his home in Epsom, Surrey, as many as four artists might work on two pages of the strip at any one time. When Hulton Press was bought up in 1959, and the Eagle moved to a new publisher, Hampson's studio system was disbanded due to its cost. He drew The Road of Courage, a carefully researched and meticulously crafted telling of the life of Jesus, with the help of his longtime assistant, Joan Porter, which concluded at Easter 1961. Hampson then began to devise seven other strip cartoon ideas, which he intended to offer to the Eagle. Partly through his own mismanagement (he told no-one what he was doing) Longacre Press accused him of breach of contract. He was forced to resign, his new strips were impounded by the legal department, and he rarely drew for comics again. The remainder of Hampson's life was spent working as a freelance commercial artist for various publications including Ladybird Books: one such book was ' The Stories of our Christmas Customs ', 1964, Series 664, written by N.F.Pearson. Hampson was voted Prestigioso Maestro at an international convention of strip cartoon and animated film artists held at Lucca, Tuscany in 1975. A jury of his peers gave him a Yellow Kid Award and declared him to be the best writer and artist of strip cartoons since the end of the Second World War. In 1978 he graduated from the Open University. He celebrated by drawing a Dan Dare strip for the university's internal magazine. The punch line of the script involved the university getting an application from Dare's nemesis The Mekon. In ailing health, Hampson died from a stroke and the lingering effects of throat cancer in July 1985, in Epsom, Surrey, England.

Career Nae Caranfil is the son of important Romanian film historian and critic Tudor Caranfil. He graduated in 1984 from the Caragiale Academy of Theatrical Arts and Cinematography (UNATC) in Bucharest, where he has also taught as a professor. In the beginning of his career he directed only short films: Venice in September (1983), Thirty Years of Insomnia (1984) and Backstage (1988). Caranfil made his feature film debut with E Pericoloso Sporgersi (1993) and continued with road movie comedy Asfalt tango starring Charlotte Rampling (1996) and with Dolce far niente (1998). His movie Filantropica (2002) was a critical success and increased Caranfil's popularity. Some consider Nae Caranfil to be the best Romanian director of the 1990s. Nae Caranfil wrote the screenplay for all his movies and worked on the music for the first two of them (E Pericoloso Sporgersi and Asfalt-tango). In 2011, Caranfil began production on the English-language feature film Closer to the Moon.

Her most prominent television roles are those of rebellious teenager Suzanne Ross in Grange Hill and single mother Michelle Fowler in the BBC soap opera EastEnders. Tully played one of EastEnders original characters, appearing in the first episode on 19 February 1985 and remaining central to the series until 1995. Tully then gave up acting to work behind the camera and has directed and produced British television programmes since then.  Early life  Tully's father was a watch-case maker, her mother a housewife, and she was brought up on a London council estate.\\"After 10 years as TV's most famous single mother, Susan Tully now craves an escape from soap megastardom ‚Äì and a bit of adventure\\", The Independent. 29 October 1995. Accessed 2007-03-14. While at school in Barnsbury, Islington, she took up acting as a hobby and attended the Anna Scher children's theatre, which began a fast track into television work.  Career  At the age of nine Tully hosted the live television children's programme Our Show, and later worked on The Saturday Banana with Bill Oddie. She was then cast in the BBC children's television serial Grange Hill. She played schoolgirl Suzanne Ross for three years (1981‚Äì1984). She had left Grange Hill and was about to go to sixth form college when she got her next big acting break. At the age of 17, Tully secured a major role in the BBC's new soap opera EastEnders. She played Michelle Fowler from the show's inception in 1985 to 1995. During her time on the show, her character became pregnant at the age of 16 after having an affair with the 39-year-old adulterer Den Watts. In December 2016, EastEnders recast the role of Michelle Fowler to actress Jenna Russell after Tully repeatedly turned down offers to return. The show's executive producer at the time, Sean O'Connor has said that Tully gave her blessing for the recast to take place. In the late 1990s, Tully began concentrating on directing for television (credited as \\"Sue Tully\\"). Shows of which she has directed episodes include EastEnders, The Story of Tracy Beaker (2002), London's Burning, 55 Degrees North (2004), The Bill (1999‚Äì2004), Funland (2005), Secret Diary of a Call Girl (2007), Lark Rise to Candleford (2009), Silent Witness (2010), Stella (2012), Good Cop (2012), Getting On (2009‚Äì2012), Truckers (2013), Puppy Love (2014), The A Word (2016‚Äì2017), Britannia (2018), Tin Star (2019) Line of Duty (2019) and Strike: Lethal White (2020).

A more modern use, especially in the United States, refers to a heyday, a period when somebody was at the peak of their abilities‚Äînot necessarily in that person's youth. The quote \\"salad days\\" is from the Shakespearean play Antony and Cleopatra and is spoken in Act 1, Scene 5, by Cleopatra. History The phrase was coined in Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra in 1606. In the speech at the end of Act One in which Cleopatra is regretting her youthful dalliances with Julius Caesar she says: > ...My salad days, / When I was green in judgment, cold in blood/To say as I > said then! The phrase became popular only from the middle of the 19th century, coming to mean ‚Äúa period of youthful inexperience or indiscretion.\\" The metaphor comes from Cleopatra's use of the word 'green' ‚Äî presumably meaning someone youthful, inexperienced, or immature. Her references to \\"green\\" and \\"cold\\" both suggest qualities of salads. Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage summarizes several other possible meanings of the metaphor: > Whether the point is that youth, like salad, is raw, or that salad is highly > flavoured and youth loves high flavours, or that innocent herbs are youth's > food as milk is babes' and meat is men's, few of those who use the phrase > could perhaps tell us; if so, it is fitter for parrots' than for human > speech.Fowler, H.

Early airboats were known as \\"hydroglisseurs\\" (airboat in French, \\"water slider\\"), hydroplanes, hydrofoils, or other names. See e.g. Flying Volume 4 (1915-1916) and Cercle du Mononautisme Classique Archives historiques (in French). They are commonly used for fishing, bowfishing, hunting, and ecotourism. Airboats are a very popular means of transportation in marshy and/or shallow areas where a standard inboard or outboard engine with a submerged propeller would be impractical, most notably in the Florida Everglades but also in the Indian River Lagoon, the Kissimmee and St. Johns rivers, and the Mekong River and Delta, as well as the Louisiana bayous and Mesopotamian Marshes.  Overview  The characteristic flat-bottomed design of the airboat, in conjunction with the fact that there are no operating parts below the waterline, allows for easy navigation through shallow swamps and marshes; in canals, rivers, and lakes; and on ice and frozen lakes. This design also makes it ideal for flood and ice rescue operations. The airboat is pushed forward by the propeller, which produces a rearward column of air behind it. The resulting prop wash averages . Steering is accomplished by diverting that column of air left or right as it passes across the rudders, which the pilot controls via a \\"stick\\" located on the operator's left side. Overall steering and control is a function of water current, wind, water depth, and propeller thrust. Airboats are very fast compared to comparably- sized motorboats: commercial airboats generally sail at speeds of around and modified airboats can go as fast as . Stopping and reversing direction are dependent upon high operator skill, since airboats do not have brakes. They are incapable of traveling in reverse, unless equipped with a reversible propeller. Some designs use a clam shell reversing device intended for braking or backing up very short distances but these systems are not commonly used. The operator and passengers, are typically seated in elevated seats that allow visibility over swamp vegetation. High visibility lets the operator and passengers see floating objects, stumps and other submerged obstacles, and animals in the boat's path. In the United States, a typical good-quality airboat in 2004 would have cost between $33,000The source cited states the price of an airboat as $25,000 to $40,000 in 2004, which is equal to between $33,000 and $53,000 in 2018 dollars. and $70,000. In a developing country like Iraq, however, an airboat could be purchased for as little as 2.5 million Iraqi dinars, or $2,147. In spite of their high cost, airboats are very widely used by civilians and tour operators: there are 12,164 airboats, 1,025 of them commercial, in Florida alone as of December 2017. Airboats are widely used in other Gulf Coast states, especially Louisiana, but they can be found in rivers, marshes, and icy areas around the world, from Nebraska to Siberia. Soviet airboats and aerosleds Airboats and airboat-like craft have been used in the Soviet Union and its successor states since the Second World War and possibly earlier. Some true airboats‚Äîvessels that operated entirely in the water‚Äîwere used by the Soviet military in World War II. These true airboats include the NKL-5, a WWII armed boat reportedly capable of speeds up to . However, most Soviet airboats are aerosleds (referred to as \\"aerosanis\\" in Russian). An aerosled is an aircraft propeller driven amphibious vehicle best described as a hybrid of a sled, airboat, and ground effect vehicle. Thousands of aerosleds were used as cargo and passenger vehicles in Siberia, where they excelled because they could cope equally well with the icy Siberian winter and the muddy, marshy conditions of Rasputitsa season (similar to the American mud season), when raw or thawing snow makes travel by road impossible. Aerosleds are still in use today. The Tupolev A-3 Aerosledge is a quintessential example of this type of vehicle; it can reach speeds of up to 120 kilometers per hour (74.6 mph) on snow and 65 km/h (40.4 mph) on water.  History  The first airboat was invented in 1905 in Nova Scotia, Canada by Alexander Graham Bell. The earliest airboats to see any kind of use date to 1915, when airboats by the British Army in the World War I Mesopotamian Campaign. However, airboats were not widely used by civilians until the 1930s. First prototypes Dr. Alexander Graham Bell with his aircraft engine test boat/airboat, the Ugly Duckling The earliest ancestors of the airboat were waterborne vehicles for testing aircraft engines. The first airboat was the Ugly Duckling, an aircraft propeller testing vehicle built in 1905 in Nova Scotia, Canada by a team led by Dr. Alexander Graham Bell. Ugly Duckling was a catamaran-type boat propelled by an \\"aerial propeller\\" hooked up to a water-cooled aircraft engine weighing . The makeshift raft-like vessel was unable to obtain a speed faster than 4 miles per hour (3.5 knots), though the \\"rapid rotation of the propeller\\" led Dr. Bell to believe that the vessel could have had a theoretical top speed of \\"thirty or forty miles an hour,\\" comparable to some modern airboats, if drag was completely eliminated. Brazilian aviation pioneer Santos Dumont built a similar catamaran vessel for testing an aircraft engine in 1907, which he termed a hydrofoil. The Tellier brothers, French aviation pioneers, made major steps towards modern airboats with their 1907 speedboat La Rapi√®re II (Rapier II). La Rapi√®re II was an long mahogany speedboat powered by a partially above water aircraft propeller hooked up to a 20 hp 4 cylinder Panhard-Levassor engine. The boat was steered by a conventional rudder in the water, which was hooked up to a ship's wheel. La Rapi√®re II could achieve speeds of up to with two people on board and with 3-4 people on board. In France Jacques Schneider, of Schneider Trophy fame, developed and experimented with his own multi-passenger brand of airboat circa 1913‚Äì1914.History of Aviation c.1972 by Kenneth Munson and J. R. Taylor Early airboats Early British Army airboats in Mesopotamia in 1918 The first airboats to see any real use date to 1915. The British Army used airboats, which they referred to as Lambert \\"Hydro-Glisseurs\\",Lambert refers to their manufacturer, the De Lambert company of France, and \\"Hydro-Glisseur\\" means \\"airboat\\" in French. in the Mesopotamian Campaign of the First World War. These \\"Hydro-Glisseurs\\" were small, flat-bottomed hydroplanes with metal- clad wooden hulls propelled by a large aircraft fan that allowed them to reach speeds of up to . They were primarily used for reconnaissance on the Tigris River. The first of these airboats, HG 1 Ariel, was constructed using the engine and propeller of a wrecked Royal Australian Air Force Farman MF.7 biplane and was provided to the forces in Mesopotamia by the British Raj. Following Ariel's successful deployment in the campaign upriver to Kut in 1915‚Äì1916, Britain ordered seven purpose-built airboats from Charles de Lambert's eponymous company De Lambert. Eight of these vessels were in operation in 1917, increasing to nine by the 1918 Armistice. A dedicated repair slipway for these boats was built at the Motor Repair Dockyard in Baghdad, indicating both their importance to the British war effort and the difficulty of maintaining them. A 1917 Scientific American cover depicting a British Army airboat on the Tigris River in Iraq Following the war, Lambert airboats were used as ferries on the shallow waters of the upper Yangtze River, on the Huangpu River, and elsewhere. Like their military counterparts, these airboats were manufactured in France, though they were assembled in Shanghai. They had drafts of only seven inches and could cruise at up to . Lambert airboats were also used widely on the upper Missouri River and on the marshes of the Florida Everglades. Farman Aircraft, the company that built the engines for the WWI military airboats, began producing civilian airboats in the 1920s. It marketed airboats for use as water taxis and as light cargo vessels or patrol boats for French colonial governments. Its airboats sold for 25,000 to 50,000 francs depending on the model, a price that proved too steep for potential buyers; the company pulled out of the boat business by the end of the 1920s. Farman airboat prototype Le Ricocheur in 1924. She was capable of speeds of up to 125 km/h (67.5 knots) These early European airboats were significantly different from their modern counterparts. Compared to the airboats of today, early European airboats tended to be somewhat larger, had higher freeboards, and lacked a protective cage surrounding the propeller. They also had a different steering mechanism: early airboats were steered with a rudder in the water controlled by a steering wheel with throttle control provided by a gas pedal, like an automobile. More modern airboats use an air rudder controlled with a joystick for steering. Early American airboats Glenn Curtiss is credited with building a type of airboat in 1920 to help facilitate his hobby of bow and arrow hunting in the Florida backwoods. The millionaire, who later went on to develop the cities of Hialeah and Miami, combined his talents in the fields of aviation and design to facilitate his hobby, and the end result was Scooter, a 6-passenger, closed-cabin, propeller- driven boat powered by an aircraft engine that allowed it to slip through wetlands at . Airboats began to become popular in the United States in the 1930s, when they were independently invented and used by a number of Floridians, most living in or around the Everglades. Some Floridians who invented their own airboats include frog hunter Johnny Lamb, who built a 75-horsepower airboat in 1933 he called the \\"whooshmobile\\" and Chokoloskee Gladesmen Ernest and Willard Yates, who built an airboat in 1935 they steered via reins attached to a crude wooden rudder. Yates holds the ignominious honor of being the first person to die in an airboating accident, when the engine dislodged and sent the spinning propeller into him. An improved airboat was invented in Utah in 1943 by Cecil Williams, Leo Young, and G. Hortin Jensen.World's First Airboat https://scontent- sjc2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/15109419_1779337522340086_2556976957131532493_n.jpg?oh=dbe23a6b7eb63dce33d92050b0c8f303&oe;=59886030 Their boat, developed and used near Brigham City, Utah, is sometimes erroneously called the first airboat. At the Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge in northern Utah, Cecil S. Williams and G. Hortin Jensen sought a solution to the problem of conducting avian botulism studies in the shallow, marshy hinterlands. By installing a 40-horsepower Continental aircraft engine, purchased for $99.50, on a flat-bottomed 12-foot long aluminum boat, they built one of the first modern airboats. Their airboat had no seat, so the skipper was forced to kneel in the boat. They dubbed it the Alligator I as a response to a joking comment from US Fish and Wildlife Service headquarters that they should \\"get an alligator from Louisiana, saddle up and ride the critter during their botulism studies.\\" Their airboat was the first to use an air rudder (a rudder directing the propeller exhaust rather than the water), a major improvement in modern airboat design. The purpose of Williams, Young, and Jensen's airboat was to help preserve and protect bird populations and animal life at the world's largest migratory game bird refuge. The Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge near Brigham City, Utah is a wetlands oasis amid the Great Basin Desert and an essential stopping point for birds migrating across North America. The need for a practical way to navigate a challenging environment of wetlands, shallow water, and thick mud helped inspire Williams, Young, and Jensen to create the flat-bottom airboat, which they initially called an \\"air thrust boat.\\" Designs and subsequent improvements and practical use of the air thrust boats appears to have been a collaborative effort. LeeRue Allen, who worked at the Refuge since 1936 appears to have also been involved and helped to document a history of the events. Many of the early airboats built at the refuge in Utah were shipped to Florida. Early records show it cost roughly $1,600 to build a boat, including the engine. Over the years, the standard design evolved through trial-and-error: an open, flat bottom boat with an engine mounted on the back, the driver sitting in an elevated position, and a cage to protect the propeller from objects flying into them. The US Army Corps of Engineers uses an airboat to collect herbicide-resistant hydrilla from Lake Seminole in northern Florida  Manufacture and design  Airboat manufacturers tend to be small, family run businesses that assemble built-to-order boats. Most airboats are manufactured in the United States, although they are also built in Russia,McLeavy, Roy, (1982). \\"Jane's Surface Skimmers\\", pp 65‚Äì67, London, England: Jane's Publishing Company Limited. Italy, Finland,Torsti tiet√§√§, Helsingin Sanomat, 28.3.2010 s. D 7 Japan, Australia, and elsewhere. Prior to 1950, most airboats were manufactured in France by companies and individuals such as Farman, De Lambert, and Ren√© Couzinet. Modern, commercially manufactured airboat hulls are made of aluminum or fiberglass. The choice of material is determined by the type of terrain in which the vessel will be operated; airboats intended for use in icy conditions will have sturdier polymer coated aluminum hulls while airboats intended for use in marshes will have lighter fiberglass hulls, for instance. Standard hunt/trail boats are long with a two- to three- passenger capacity. Tour boats can be much larger, accommodating 18 passengers or more. Engines are either an air-cooled, 4- or 6-cylinder aircraft or water- cooled, large-displacement, V8 automotive engine, ranging from 50 to over 600 hp. Automotive engines tend to be less expensive due to readily-available replacement parts and less expensive high octane automotive gas. Since an opposed, 4- or 6-cylinder (O4 or O6) aircraft powerplant contains fewer moving parts than a standard automotive engine, it is easier to repair and weighs less. However, automotive engines can be repaired by more-common car mechanics and do not require specialized repair personnel like aircraft engines do. Most of the sound produced by an airboat comes from the propeller, although the engine itself also contributes some noise. Modern airboat designs are significantly quieter thanks to mufflers and multi-blade carbon-fiber propellers.  Safety  Aft view of a safety cage during operation As with any vehicle, the safety of an airboat is dependent on the training and skill of its operator and the use of safety features like seat belts and flotation devices/life jackets. Airboats should only be piloted by trained and qualified operators, and knowledge of operational safety is essential when operating an airboat. Over 75 airboat accidents happened in Florida between 2014 and 2017, resulting in seven deaths and 102 severe injuries. Most (five of seven) deaths were drownings, and 90 percent of accident victims were not wearing life jackets, even though only 30 percent knew how to swim. Not wearing a seat belt is another major predictor of injury in an accident: 40 percent of injured victims and the only two non-drowning fatalities were flung from their seats in the crashes. The most common injuries suffered in airboat accidents are severe cuts, bruises, and broken limbs. Other severe injuries are not uncommon: 10 percent of injured people suffered neck and back injuries requiring surgery and long-term pain medication and another 10 percent suffered traumatic head and brain injuries. Most airboat accidents‚Äî64%‚Äîare the fault of the operator, according to a 2017 analysis by the Miami New Times, almost always due to one of three factors: # a lack of boating education or training; # a lack of safety equipment, such as seat belts or flotation devices, or a failure to properly use safety equipment; # or reckless behavior, including drug or alcohol consumption and improper lookout. The engine and propeller of an airboat are enclosed in a protective metal cage that prevents objects, such as tree limbs, branches, clothing, beverage containers, passengers, or wildlife, from coming into contact with the whirling propeller, which can cause traumatic injury to the operator and passengers or devastating damage to the vessel. Safety cages do not always work perfectly, however: people have had their fingers sliced off by airboat propellers, and tree branches entering safety cages have wrecked airboat propellers and sprayed the operators and passengers with woodchips and other shrapnel. Airboats are prone to capsizing and sinking because they are top- heavy, unstable, and extremely shallow draft. This makes them especially dangerous on the open sea or in rough or stormy conditions. Airboats with a \\"long-belt gear reduction drive unit\\" and an automobile engine avoid these risks because the long belt allows for the engine to be mounted inside the hull, which lowers the center of gravity and lowers the capsizing risk. Some companies and organizations, including Airboat West and the Los Alamos National Laboratory, have built airboats with low centers of gravity for use in windy or rough conditions or in rescues with obstacles like low-hanging power lines. Airboats can also be equipped with autoinflation devices, similar to car airbags or autoinflating personal life vests, that can reduce the risk of capsizing. In 1999 the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service's National Conservation Training Center, located in Shepherdstown, West Virginia, produced a 70-minute training video entitled Airboat Safety ‚Äì Design-Operation-Maintenance in cooperation with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in Jacksonville, Florida. The video includes an early history of airboats and interviews with two airboat manufacturers in Florida. It was considered to be the only airboat video of its kind when it was made and may still be the only one with the range of airboat subject matter ever produced in the US. Since it was produced by the federal government of the United States, it is in the public domain. Five hundred copies of the video were produced. Regulation On March 30, 2018 Gov. Rick Scott of Florida signed ‚ÄúEllie‚Äôs Law,‚Äù which requires operators to complete CPR instruction and a course on airboats run by the state's wildlife commission. The law is named after Elizabeth ‚ÄúEllie‚Äù Goldenberg, who died from an airboat accident in Miami-Dade County the day after her graduation from college. Beginning July 1, 2019, airboat operators will need to be able to show proof they completed the training courses. Violations are a misdemeanor offense punishable by up to a $500 fine. Florida state law also stipulates that airboats must have an \\"automotive-style factory muffler, underwater exhaust, or other manufactured device capable of adequately muffling the sound of the engine exhaust\\" and an international orange flag that is at least 10\\" by 12\\" flying from a mast or flagpole that is at least 10 feet taller than the lowest point on the boat, in order to increase visibility and reduce the odds of a collision. Airboat operators, pilots, or drivers in Florida must be 14 or older.  Rescue  A resident is transported by airboat after Hurricane Katrina In recent years, airboats have proven indispensable for flood, shallow water, and ice rescue operations. As a result, they have grown in popularity for public safety uses. During the flooding of New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina, August 29, 2005, airboats from across the United States rescued thousands of flood victims. Thirty airboats crewed by civilian volunteers evacuated over 1,100 patients and 4,000 medical personnel and family members from four downtown New Orleans hospitals in less than 36 hours. This \\"Cajun Navy\\" morphed into a grassroots volunteer search and rescue organization that has deployed to rescue people during Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Florence, and other natural disasters. Numerous articles have been published in fire-rescue trade journals such as Fire Engineering and National Fire and Rescue Magazine describing the advantages, capabilities, and benefits of using airboats for water rescue operations, and providing in-depth description of actual water rescue incidents, including the flooding of New Orleans.Rescuing New Orleans ‚Äì Nov./Dec. 2005\\"You Want To Buy A What\\" - March/April 2004Saving Lives Across America ‚Äì August 2004 Airboats are particularly effective at water rescues in shallow, marshy, or icy winter environments. Airboats are partially amphibious and can therefore navigate effectively over obstacles, such as partially submerged buildings and wreckage or sea ice, that would stop a normal boat. In ice rescues, use of airboats cuts the average rescue time from 45 to 60 minutes to seven to 12 minutes, according to data from Minnesota fire departments. They are also faster, larger, safer, and more durable than other small boats used in ice rescues. Though airboats are highly effective at water and ice rescues, airboats and helicopters do not work well together. Rotor wash from low-flying helicopters can push and even capsize airboats. During post-Katrina rescue operations, a helicopter's rotor wash was reported to have capsized one airboat, and many airboats were blown into the sides of buildings, standing utility poles, and bridge pilings by low-flying helicopters. U.S. Customs and Border Protection patrols the Rio Grande River border in an airboat Military use Airboats are used by various militaries and border patrols around the world as well as by the U.S. Coast Guard. In addition to the use of airboats by the British Army in the Mesopotamian Campaign of WWI and by the Soviet Union in the Eastern Front of WWII, airboats have been used by the US Army and Iraqi security forces in the Vietnam and Iraq wars, respectively. US Special Forces Aircat airboat in Vietnam During the Vietnam War the Hurricane Aircat airboat was used by U.S. Special Forces and South Vietnamese troops to patrol riverine and marshy areas where larger boats could not go. Two of these airboats were also used by the Khmer National Navy after they were captured from the U.S. Special Forces by the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) in September 1967.Kenneth Conboy, Kenneth Bowra, and Mike Chappell, The War in Cambodia 1970‚Äì75, Men-at-arms series 209, Osprey Publishing Ltd, London 1989. . pp. 23*Kenneth Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970‚Äì1975, Equinox Publishing (Asia) Pte Ltd, Djakarta 2011. pp. 239\\" Airboats are also used in Texas and Iraq for border patrol. The airboats used in Iraq were supplied by American companies and assembled in Iraq by American civilian contractors, and they are used by both American and Iraqi forces to patrol the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, the marshes of southeastern Iraq, and the Shatt al-Arab waterway, the latter two of which include parts of the Iran-Iraq border. Modern Iraqi military airboats are long, powered by 454 hp engines hooked up to Whirlwind propellers, and armed with M240 crew-served machine guns. The Nov/Dec 2007 issue of Airboating Magazine had an article on airboats used in Vietnam and in Iraq and has had numerous articles on airboats used by U.S Coast Guard and other state and county EMS units for rescue of ice fisherman and rescue in floods or after hurricanes. In 2013 the Iraqi Ministry of Oil purchased 20 airboats for use as personnel transport, patrol, and cable laying and light cargo boats in the rivers and marshes of Iraq.

He is the host of programmes such as Essential Mix and Essential Selection on the radio service, which can be heard through Internet radio streams, for his record label FFRR Records, and for his own performances at nightclubs and music festivals. Tong has also worked as a record producer, and is regarded as the \\"global ambassador for electronic music.\\" The phrase \\"It's all gone Pete Tong\\", where the name is used as rhyming slang for \\"a bit wrong\\", was reputedly first coined by Paul Oakenfold in late 1987 in an article about acid house called \\"Bermondsey Goes Balearic\\" for Terry Farley and Pete Heller's Boys Own fanzine.\\"Pete Tong Issues a Wikipedia Correction and Announces Concert at Mansion October 27\\" S. Pajot \\"CrossFade, the Music Blog\\", 19 October 2010, accessed 19 October 2010, Miami New Times It's All Gone Pete Tong is also the title of a 2004 film which portrays a fictional DJ's experiences as he realizes he is becoming deaf. Tong appears briefly in the film. It is also the name Tong has adopted for his club night at the nightclub Pacha in Ibiza and his nightly radio programme in the United States on iHeartRadio's \\"Evolution\\" EDM format platform. In 2008, Tong was involved with organizing the International Music Summit in Ibiza, an event that has become an annual fixture (the 2016 Summit was held during 25‚Äì27 May). In 2017, Tong won Radio Show of the Year at the Electronic Music Awards for \\"The Essential Collection\\". Biography=Early life Tong was born in Dartford, Kent in 1960, and was educated at King's School, Rochester, Kent. Tong's original musical interest was in drumming, but he soon moved on to DJing. He played his first public gig at a friend's wedding at age 15. While at school he and a couple of friends earned some extra money by promoting a couple of local bands and booking halls for gigs. He also worked as part of the Kent \\"Soul Mafia\\" bringing soul weekenders to seaside towns such as Caister-on-Sea and Prestatyn. Tong was heavily influenced by the late DJ Froggy in his early years. Initially after leaving school, Tong set up a mobile disco based in a Ford Transit van, but he soon started his own club in Baker Street called Family Function. He also booked bands for an alternative night, the first of which was the then unknown Culture Club. Tong originally performed as a DJ using the name \\"Kickstart Roadshow\\" and then later \\"OHMS Roadshow\\" with an extensive sound system. Later he became DJ and promoter at the Kings Lodge club in West Kingsdown. Later moving venue to the Hill Top, also in West Kingsdown, he was responsible for breaking classics such as Lonnie Liston Smith's \\"Expansions\\" and Ritchie Cole's \\"Groovin on a New York Afternoon\\". In 1979 Tong became an advertising sales assistant for Blues & Soul Magazine. After a year he also contributed some reviews, gossip and sales charts, which continued until 1983. He left Blues & Soul to join London Records as an A&R; manager. Through his connections in London Records, Tong was exposed to the newly emerging house music sound from Chicago. In 1986, Tong organised a compilation album, The House Sound of Chicago, Vol. 1, the first British release to gather and expose this genre. Career Radio = Tong's first appearance on radio was in the late 1970s on Radio Invicta 92.4fm, Europe's first soul music station. He joined a rotation of nightclub DJs to present monthly guest shows. Later, he appeared on local radio station BBC Radio Medway, as part of the 'Soul Mafia', and performed occasional mixes for Radio London. In 1981, Tong made his first appearance on Radio 1 as the host of a 15-minute feature on Peter Powell's show‚Äîhe played new tracks, and covered the latest gossip and news from the dance music industry. When Invicta Radio started in Kent in 1984, Tong became the host of a regular soul show on the station. As Tong had joined the developing dance-DJ management company of DJ-turned-journalist Eddie Gordon, of the Kent Messenger, he built a prominent county profile and performed at Gordon's local club 'The Slammer'. Tong joined Capital Radio in 1988 to present a weekly dance programme. In January 1991\\"BBC Genome\\" Friday 11 January 1991 Tong began his Friday evening show, branded as the Essential Selection for its first 15 years, on BBC Radio 1. The show still continues every week (currently it is broadcast at 9pm for two hours, either pre-recorded from Tong's garage at his home in Los Angeles, or live from the eighth floor of Broadcasting House),Interview on \\"Steve Wright in the Afternoon\\", BBC Radio 2, 29 November 2016, 4:39 pm (GMT) and Tong is the second-longest serving living DJ (after Annie Nightingale) on the station. Additionally, a one-hour Sunday edition of the programme, called \\"The Essential Selection - Part 2\\", was broadcast from April 1992 to April 1993.\\"BBC Genome\\" Pete Tong's Essential Selection Part 2 A spinoff, titled The Rap Selection (featuring rap, ragga and new jack swing), aired on Thursday evenings\\"BBC Genome\\" The Rap Selection on the station from 9 to 10pm from April 1991 until March 1992. From October 1993 Tong oversaw the production of the Essential Mix show, which was devised and, until 2003, produced by Gordon.\\"BBC Genome\\" Pete Tong The show was the first BBC production to broadcast live from Ibiza, Spain. The 500th mix was broadcast on 23/24 April 2010, featuring solely Tong on the Friday night, and Tong, plus DJs Sasha and Richie Hawtin, live from Circus nightclub in Liverpool, UK, for the second section. In November 2012 Tong was asked by Clear Channel Communications in the US to help launch a new EDM channel, on their iHeartRadio platform, called 'Evolution'. Along with the launch of the channel, Tong introduced a nightly two-hour programme titled Its All Gone Pete Tong, which is similar to his BBC 1 programme. The platform would later form the basis for Clear Channel to expand the Evolution brand, with the 20 December 2012 launch of the format on WEDX/Boston that included Tong's station promos and voiceovers. Likewise, Tong's iHeartRadio programme is also broadcast on WEDX. In addition, a supplemental 2-hour weekly programme, Evolution Beatport Show, is also aired on various Top 40/CHR and Rhythmic stations in the U.S. and in other countries, and is syndicated by Premiere Networks. In 2019 Tong started a series for BBC Radio 2 called Pete Tong‚Äôs House Nation, a personal exploration of house music. = DJ = Tong is one of Britain's most recognised DJs, having gained a large following of fans from his Essential Selection programme. He was appointed a Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in the 2014 New Year Honours for services to Broadcasting and Music. From 2003 to 2007 Tong was the resident DJ at Pacha nightclub in Ibiza, where he oversaw the Pure Pacha events. In 2008 Tong left Pacha and signed with Eden nightclub in Sant Antoni de Portmany to host his own Wonderland night. Tong explained in a 2009 interview that he, \\"from a UK perspective\\", he has played in Ibiza since inception (1991) and, as of the time of the interview, divided his time between the UK, Ibiza and the US. In March 2011 he announced that he would be returning to Pacha on Friday nights with a new event named 'All Gone Pete Tong'. Tong played the Together Winter Music Festival in London, UK, at Alexandra Palace on 26 November 2011. He appeared in the 2016 Grammy-nominated documentary film about American DJ and producer Steve Aoki, titled I'll Sleep When I'm Dead. Tong has returned to DJ in his native Kent several times in his professional career, including several stints at The Loft in Maidstone. Additionally, Tong hosts a pool party each year during Miami Music Week at one of the hotels on South Beach. In 2018, Tong was joined by Idris Elba, The Black Madonna, Black Coffee and The Martinez Brothers, among others.

Paul Getty Museum, commonly referred to as the Getty, is an art museum in Los Angeles, California housed on two campuses: the Getty Center and Getty Villa. The Getty Center is located in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles and features pre-20th-century European paintings, drawings, illuminated manuscripts, sculpture, decorative arts, and photographs from the inception of photography through present day from all over the world.http://www.getty.edu/museum/about.html Retrieved March 16, 2018.http://www.getty.edu/art/photographs/ Retrieved March 16, 2018. The original Getty museum, the Getty Villa, is located in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles and displays art from Ancient Greece, Rome, and Etruria.  History  In 1974, J. Paul Getty opened a museum in a re-creation of the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum on his property in Malibu, California. In 1982, the museum became the richest in the world when it inherited US$1.2 billion. In 1983, after an economic downturn in what was then West Germany, the Getty Museum acquired 144 illuminated medieval manuscripts from the financially struggling Ludwig Collection in Aachen; John Russell, writing in The New York Times, said of the collection, \\"One of the finest holdings of its kind ever assembled, it is quite certainly the most important that was in private hands.\\"Eric Pace (July 23, 1996), Peter Ludwig, 71, German Art Collector, Dies New York Times. In 1997, the museum moved to its current location in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles; the Malibu museum, renamed the \\"Getty Villa\\", was renovated and reopened in 2006.  GettyGuide  The Getty attracts approximately 1.8 million visitors a year. A suite of interactive multimedia tools called GettyGuide allows visitors to access information about exhibitions. Within the Museum, the GettyGuide multimedia player provides commentary from curators and conservators on many works of art. Architect Richard Meier chose beige-colored Italian travertine panels to cover the retaining walls and to serve as paving stones for the arrival plaza and Museum courtyard.  The controversies with Italy and Greece  In the 1970s and 1980s, the curator, Ji≈ô√≠ Frel, designed a tax manipulation scheme which expanded the museum collection of antiquities, essentially buying artifacts of dubious provenance, as well as a number of artifacts generally considered fakes, such as the Getty kouros. In 1984, Frel was demoted, and in 1986, he resigned. The Getty is involved in a controversy regarding proper title to some of the artwork in its collection. The museum's previous curator of antiquities, Marion True (hired by Frel), was indicted in Italy in 2005 (along with famed dealer Robert E. Hecht) on criminal charges relating to trafficking in stolen antiquities. Similar charges have been addressed by the Greek authorities. The primary evidence in the case came from the 1995 raid of a Geneva, Switzerland, warehouse which had contained a fortune in stolen artifacts. Italian art dealer Giacomo Medici was arrested in 1997; his operation was thought to be \\"one of the largest and most sophisticated antiquities networks in the world, responsible for illegally digging up and spiriting away thousands of top-drawer pieces and passing them on to the most elite end of the international art market\\".Men's Vogue, Nov/Dec 2006, Vol. 2, No. 3, pg. 46. In 2005 True was forced to tender her resignation by the Board of Trustees, which announced her early retirement. Italy allowed the statute of limitations of the charges filed against her to expire in October 2010.Felch, Jason and Ralph Frammolino (2011), Chasing Aphrodite: The Hunt for Looted Antiquities at the World's Richest Museum. Boston and New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, pp. 265‚Äì66, 312. In a letter to the J. Paul Getty Trust on December 18, 2006, True stated that she was being made to \\"carry the burden\\" for practices which were known, approved, and condoned by the Getty's Board of Directors. True is currently under investigation by Greek authorities over the acquisition of a 2,500-year-old funerary wreath, that was illegally excavated and smuggled outside of the country. The wreath, along with a 6th- century BC statue of a kore, have been returned to Greece and are currently exhibited at the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki. Additionally, a 2,400-year-old, black limestone stele and a marble votive relief dating from about 490 BC were also returned. The succulent garden at the museum On November 20, 2006, the director of the museum, Michael Brand, announced that 26 disputed pieces were to be returned to Italy, but not the Victorious Youth, which is still claimed by the Italian authorities. In 2007, the Los Angeles J. Paul Getty Museum was forced to return 40 artifacts, including a 5th-century BC statue of the goddess Aphrodite, which was looted from Morgantina, an ancient Greek settlement in Sicily. The Getty Museum resisted the requests of the Italian government for nearly two decades, only to admit later that \\"there might be 'problems'\\" attached to the acquisition.\\" In 2006, Italian senior cultural official Giuseppe Proietti said: \\"The negotiations haven't made a single step forward.\\" Only after he suggested the Italian government \\"to take cultural sanctions against the Getty, suspending all cultural cooperation,\\" did the J. Paul Getty Museum return the antiquities. In another unrelated case in 1999, the Getty Museum had to hand over three antiquities to Italy after determining they were stolen. The objects included a Greek red-figure kylix from the 5th-century BC, signed by the painter Onesimos and the potter Euphronios as potter, looted from the Etruscan site of Cerveteri; a torso of the god Mithra from the 2nd-century AD, and the head of a youth by the Greek sculptor Polykleitos. In 2016, the terracotta head of the Greek god Hades was returned to Sicily (Italy). The archaeological artifact was looted from Morgantina in the 1970s. The Getty museum purchased the terracotta head of Hades in 1985 from the New York collector Maurice Tempelsman, who had purchased it from the London dealer Robin Symes. Getty records show the museum paid $530,000 for it. On December 21, 2016, the head of Hades was added to the collection of the archaeological museum of Aidone, where it joined the statue of Demeter, the mother of his consort Persephone. Sicilian archaeologists found a blue curl that was missing from Hades' beard, and so it proved the origin of the terracotta head. Response during the COVID-19 pandemic  Many museums turned to their existing social media presences to engage their audience online during the COVID-19 pandemic. Inspired by the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam and Instagram accounts such as the Dutch Tussen Kunst & Quarantaine (‚Äúbetween art and quarantine‚Äù) and Covid Classics, the Getty sponsored the Getty Museum Challenge, inviting people to use everyday objects to recreate works of art and share their creations on social media, prompting thousands of submissions. The museum was among those singled out for particular praise by industry analysts for their successful social media content strategy during the shutdown, both for the challenge and for incorporating its works into the popular video game Animal Crossing.

Biography Charpentier was born in Paris, and intended for the bar, but was employed by Colbert, who had determined on the foundation of a French East India Company, to draw up an explanatory account of the project for Louis XIV. Charpentier regarded as absurd the use of Latin in monumental inscriptions, and to him was entrusted the task of supplying the paintings of Charles Le Brun in the Versailles Gallery with appropriate legends. His verses were so indifferent that they had to be replaced by others, the work of Jean Racine and Nicolas Boileau-Despr√©aux, both enemies of his. Charpentier in his Excellence de la langue fran√ßaise (1683) had anticipated Charles Perrault in the famous academical dispute concerning the relative merit of the ancients and moderns. He is credited with a share in the production of the magnificent series of medals that commemorate the principal events of the age of Louis XIV. Charpentier, who was long in receipt of a pension of 1200 livres from Colbert, was erudite and ingenious, but he was always heavy and commonplace. His other works include a Vie de Socrate (1650), a translation of the Cyropaedia of Xenophon (1658), and the Trait√© de la peinture parlante (1684).

Clad in a red, skin-tight, rabbit-eared body suit with a black N inscribed in a white circle on his chest, the Noid was a physical manifestation of all the challenges inherent in getting a pizza delivered in 30 minutes or less. Though persistent, his efforts were repeatedly thwarted. History The Noid was created in 1986 by Group 243, the advertising agency of record for Domino's Pizza. Group 243 hired Will Vinton Studios to sketch the Noid and animate the commercials. The Noid character design was chosen by Christopher Baker and Brian Baker, sons of Scott Baker, master franchisor for the European market at the time, from a collection of prototypes. Commercials that featured the character used the slogan \\"Avoid the Noid.\\" The character was voiced by Pons Maar. In 1988 a Saturday morning cartoon series called The Noids was planned by CBS that would have featured the Noid, but the series was scrapped amid complaints that it was merely an advertising ploy and not a show for children. As part of the advertising campaign, a computer game was released in 1989 called Avoid the Noid. The object of the game is to deliver a pizza within a half-hour time limit in an apartment building swarming with Noids (some of which are armed with pizza-seeking missiles or water balloons). The common version is version 1.0 and has CGA graphics and PC speaker sound effects, although version 1.1 also exists which added support for EGA graphics and Adlib music. In 1990, Capcom released a different video game, Yo! Noid, for the NES.  Decline =Kenneth Lamar Noid On January 30, 1989, Kenneth Lamar Noid, a mentally ill man who thought the ad campaign was a personal attack on himself, entered a Domino's restaurant in Chamblee, Georgia, armed with a .357 Magnum and held two employees hostage for over five hours. After telling the employees that Domino's owner Tom Monaghan had stolen his name, he forced them to call Domino's headquarters and demand $100,000 and a white limousine as getaway transportation. After offering to exchange one hostage for a copy of The Widow's Son, Noid reneged on his offer after a police officer brought him the book. Noid eventually became hungry and forced the employees to make him two special pizzas. While Noid ate the pizzas with his gun in his lap, the hostages escaped. Noid surrendered to the police shortly after. After the incident, Police Chief Reed Miller told reporters, \\"He's paranoid.\\" Noid was charged with kidnapping, aggravated assault, extortion, and possession of a firearm during a crime. He was found not guilty by reason of insanity. Noid spent time in a mental institution, but committed suicide in 1995. This incident has been insinuated to have caused Domino's Pizza to discontinue advertising using the Noid as their mascot, though this has been rejected by the company and the advertisers.  Return of the Noid  Domino's brought the Noid back for a limited run of 1,000 T-shirts in December 2009. On May 4, 2011, the Noid was brought back as a promotional figure by Domino's to be used in a campaign on their Facebook page, and made a brief appearance as a stuffed toy at the end of a May 2011 commercial promoting a one-topping pizza deal. The 25th birthday of the Noid mascot was marked with the video game The Noid's Super Pizza Shootout, a tribute to Avoid the Noid. In June 2016, Spooky Pinball LLC announced the release of their new licensed pinball machine, Domino's Spectacular Pinball Adventure prominently featuring The Noid character. During 2016, the Noid appeared and was referenced in some Domino's commercials, as part of their USA \\"Pizza Payback\\" campaign. The Noid was seen tattooed on the arm of a winner of shares of Domino's stock, in a commercial aired during the NFL playoffs, January 15, 2017. In August 2017, a fan-made sequel to Yo! Noid was created for the New Jam City 2017 game jam called Yo! Noid 2: Enter the Void. The Noid can be seen briefly in the background of a 2017 Domino's ad. NOID can be seen as the print on a stop sign in the background of a Domino's ad campaign (advertising GPS notifications with mobile order) as of February 2020.  References in popular culture  The Noid has been referred to in popular culture, including two episodes of Family Guy (an altercation with Mayor West in the episode \\"Deep Throats\\" and vomiting into a toilet while Bill Cosby holds his ears in the episode \\"Peter's Sister\\"), in two episodes of 30 Rock, in a segment of Michael Jackson: Moonwalker and in two episodes of The Simpsons, once as a Thanksgiving Day parade balloon in the episode \\"Homer vs. Dignity,\\" and the other in person in the episode \\"She of Little Faith\\". The Noid is referred to in the 19th episode of season 2 of The Goldbergs (set in the 1980s), when Barry lands a job delivering pizzas and is told how important it is to \\"avoid the Noid\\". He is so bad at his job, the boss eventually accuses Barry of being the Noid. The Noid is referenced by the Rooster Teeth card based party game ‚ÄùMillion Dollars, But‚Äù in a card included in the 1980s theme pack. The Noid can be seen on a napkin in the 1990 live action Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie. https://www.reddit.com/r/TMNT/comments/anzovt/at_first_i_was_like_woah_its_the_noid_on_donnies/ A new version of The Noid was created in the video game Dark Souls for the Polygon video series Monster Factory, created by Justin and Griffin McElroy..

Led by Adrien de Gerlache de Gomery aboard the RV Belgica, it was the first Belgian Antarctic expedition and is considered the first expedition of the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. Among its members were Frederick Cook and Roald Amundsen, explorers who would later be responsible, respectively, for the conquest of the North Pole and the South Pole.  Preparation and surveying  In 1896, after a period of intensive lobbying, Adrien Victor Joseph de Gerlache de Gomery purchased the Norwegian-built whaling ship Patria, which, following an extensive refit, he renamed . Gerlache had worked together with the Geographical Society of Brussels to organize a national subscription, but was only able to outfit his expedition after the Belgian government voted in favor of two large subsidies, making it a state-supported undertaking.A. Cabay, 'The funding of the Belgian Antarctic expedition 1897‚Äì1899' in: Decleir, H. en C. De Broyer ed., The Belgica expedition centennial: perspectives on Antarctic science and history (Brussels 2001) 83‚Äì92. With a multinational crew that included Roald Amundsen from Norway, Emil Racovi»õƒÉ from Romania, and Henryk Arctowski from Poland, the Belgica set sail from Antwerp on 16 August 1897. En route to the Antarctic, the expedition visited Madeira, Rio de Janeiro, and Montevideo. The Belgica was received particularly enthusiastically in Rio, where a large Belgian community lived. Frederick Cook, an American, joined the expedition there. The Brazilians were also very interested in the Belgian scientific undertaking. The Historical and Geographical Society of Rio held a special meeting where the scientists and officers of the expedition were offered membership.A. de Gerlache de Gomery, Fifteen months in the Antarctic (Bluntisham 1998) 22. A few weeks later, in Montevideo, Amundsen wrote in his diary that he had never seen so many beautiful women \\"in one place at the same time\\". During January 1898, the Belgica reached the coast of Graham Land. On 22 January, Carl Wiencke was washed overboard during a storm and drowned. Wiencke Island was named in his honor. Sailing in between the Graham Land coast and a long string of islands to the west, Gerlache named the passage \\"Belgica Strait\\"; it was later renamed Gerlache Strait in his honor. After charting and naming several islands from some 20 separate landings, the expedition crossed the Antarctic Circle on 15 February. Failing to find a way into the Weddell Sea, on 28 February, Gerlache's expedition became trapped in the ice of the Bellinghausen Sea, near Peter I Island. It is likely that Gerlache intentionally sailed deep into the pack ice in order to freeze his vessel into the ice for the winter. Despite the crew's efforts to free the ship, they quickly realised that they would be trapped for the duration of the Antarctic winter.  Winter  trapped in the ice The expedition was poorly equipped and did not have enough winter clothing for every man on board. There was a shortage of food, and what there was lacked in variety. Penguins and seals were hunted and the meat stored before the onset of winter left the region devoid of wildlife. Warm clothing was improvised out of the materials available. On 21 March 1898, the expedition's physician, Frederick Cook, wrote: \\"We are imprisoned in an endless sea of ice ... We have told all the tales, real and imaginative, to which we are equal. Time weighs heavily upon us as the darkness slowly advances.\\" Several weeks later, on 17 May, the perpetual darkness of polar night set in, and lasted until 23 July. Gerlache disliked the penguin and seal meat that had been killed and stored and initially tried to ban its consumption, but eventually encouraged it. Signs of scurvy began to show in a number of the men. Gerlache and Captain Georges Lecointe became so ill they wrote their wills. Two of the crew started to show signs of mental illness and morale in general was extremely poor. Lieutenant Danco fell ill from a heart condition and died on 5 June. Danco Island was named in his honor. Several men reportedly lost their sanity, including one Belgian sailor who left the ship \\"announcing he was going back to Belgium.\\" Frederick Cook and the first mate, Roald Amundsen, then took command as Gerlache and Lecointe were unable to fulfill their roles due to scurvy. The true cause of scurvy as a deficiency of Vitamin C was not discovered until the 1920s, but Cook was convinced that fresh meat was the cure for scurvy due to his experiences with Robert Peary in the Arctic. He retrieved the frozen penguin and seal meat and insisted that each man eat some each day. Even Gerlache began to eat the meat and slowly the men recovered their health. Several months of hardship followed. Even as spring and summer arrived, attempts to free the ship and its crew from the grip of the ice failed. By January 1899, Belgica was still trapped in ice about thick and the possibility of another winter in the ice was becoming real. Open water was visible about half a mile away and Cook suggested that trenches be cut to the open water to allow the Belgica to escape the ice. The weakened crew used dynamite and various tools to create the channel. Finally, on 15 February, they managed to slowly start down the channel they had cleared during the weeks before. It took them nearly a month to cover , and on 14 March, they cleared the ice. The expedition returned to Antwerp on 5 November 1899. Though the circumstances were severe, the expedition had nevertheless managed to collect a significant amount of scientific data, including a full year of meteorological observations.  Reception  In Antwerp, the return of the expedition was heartily welcomed. A special committee had been planning the festivities for months.'Expedition Antarctique Belge. Reception solonnelle des explorateurs a leurs arriv√©e a Anvers' in: Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© Royale de G√©ographie d'Anvers 24 (1900) 5‚Äì17. Typical for polar expeditions in this age, feelings of national and regional pride surrounded the homecoming celebrations. On the day they first set foot on Belgian soil again, La Braban√ßonne sounded and the national flag was seen waving from many houses. The Belgian state honored Gerlache and his men by making them members of the Royal Order of Leopold, and the municipal government of Antwerp honored the men with medals and by writing their names in the Golden Book of the city.

Harold Bell of Western Publishing (and the producer of the Smokey Bear public service announcements), along with Glen Kovar and Chuck Williams, originally created the mascot in 1970 as part of a United States Forest Service campaign to raise awareness of protecting the environment. Woodsy's slogan was officially introduced on September 15, 1971 by Secretary of Agriculture Clifford Hardin. The first Woodsy Owl public service spot was created by U.S. Forest Ranger Chuck Williams, who was the Forest Service's technical consultant for the Lassie TV show which featured a Forest Service Ranger and his family. Williams, along with Bell and Glenn Kovar, also of the U.S. Forest Service, brainstormed the idea for the Woodsy motif name together in Los Angeles, California, in 1970. In 1974, the U.S. Congress passed the Woodsy Owl Act (Public Law 93-318) to protect the character making it a federal crime to reproduce his image or original slogan. Despite the documented history of Woodsy Owl's creation, various rival claims to his parentage have emerged over the years. Several individuals have stated that they invented Woodsy Owl as children as part of a nationwide poster contest. The Forest History Society has said that no evidence of such has been provided. Several songs have been used in conjunction with the Woodsy Owl environmental campaign, including \\"The Ballad of Woodsy Owl\\" and \\"Help Woodsy Spread the Word\\". Jon \\"Bermuda\\" Schwartz, the drummer for \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic, recorded \\"The Woodsy Owl Song.\\" For his appearances in commercials that aired in the 1970s and 1980s, Woodsy was voiced by several different actors, including Sterling Holloway, Barry Gordon, Dave Kimber, and Frank Welker. Several other environmentalism-, conservation- or outdoor-themed comics and characters have appeared over the years, including Mark Trail and Smokey Bear.

It is located near the ruins of the old Princely Court built by Vlad III the Impaler. History It was named after Leipzig (Lipsca in 17th century Romanian), as that was the origin of many of the wares that could be found on the main street. The word lipscan (singular of lipscani) meant trader who brought his wares from Western Europe. All trades were found in the area, including goldsmiths, hatters, shoemakers, tanners, saddlemakers, etc., many guilds (or isnafuri) having their own street: even nowadays, the nearby streets bear the name of a trade (BlƒÉnari = Furriers street, »òelari = Saddlemakers street, etc.). During the Communist period, the whole area was scheduled to be demolished, but this never came to fruition. The district became neglected, but nowadays is the most attractive area for tourists of all Bucharest. As of 2013, many of the buildings were restored. In the early 21st century, much of the district has been transformed into a pedestrian zone.

The club closed in 2000, however, and the property was bought by Trinity Western University to house its academic- internship program, the Laurentian Leadership Centre. It now houses Trinity Western students who are interning in various governmental, cultural, business, journalistic, or non-governmental offices. In 1990, the building was designated a National Historic Site of Canada.http://lieuxpatrimoniaux.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=12018 References Houses in Ottawa Designated heritage properties in Ottawa Trinity Western University National Historic Sites in Ontario ","title":"Booth House (Ottawa)"},{"id":"1355554","text":"Xavier de Maistre (; 10 October 1763 - 12 June 1852) of Savoy (then part of the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia) lived largely as a military man, but is known as a French writer. The younger brother of noted philosopher and counter-revolutionary Joseph de Maistre, Xavier was born to an aristocratic family at Chamb√©ry in October 1763. He served when young in the army of Piedmont-Sardinia, and in 1790 wrote his fantasy Voyage autour de ma chambre (\\"Voyage Around My Room\\", published 1794), when he was under arrest in Turin as the consequence of a duel. Life Xavier shared the political sympathies of his brother Joseph, and after a French revolutionary army annexed Savoy to France in 1792, he left the service, and eventually took a commission in the Russian army. He served under Alexander Suvorov in his victorious Austro- Russian campaign and accompanied the marshal to Russia in 1796. By then, Suvorov's patron Catherine II of Russia had died, and the new monarch Paul I dismissed the victorious general (partly on account of the massacre of 20,000 Poles after he conquered Warsaw). Xavier de Maistre shared the disgrace of his general, and supported himself for some time in St. Petersburg by miniature painting, particularly landscapes. In 1803, Joseph de Maistre was appointed as Piedmont-Sardinia's ambassador to the court of Alexander I, Tsar of Russia. On his brother's arrival in St. Petersburg, Xavier de Maistre was introduced to the Minister of the Navy, and was appointed to several posts including director of the Library, and of the Museum of Admiralty. He also joined active service, and was wounded in the Caucasus, attaining the rank of major-general. In 1812 he married a Russian lady, related to the Tsars, Mrs. Zagriatsky. He remained in Russia even after the overthrow of Napoleon and the consequent restoration of the Piedmontese dynasty. Literary work Memorial of Joseph and Xavier de Maistre in front of the Castle of Chamb√©ry His Voyage autour de ma chambre (1794), a parody set in the tradition of the grand travel narrative, is an autobiographical account of how a young official, imprisoned in his room for six weeks, looks at the furniture, engravings, etc., as if they were scenes from a voyage in a strange land. He praises this voyage because it does not cost anything, and for this reason it is strongly recommended to the poor, the infirm, and the lazy. His room is a long square, and the perimeter is thirty-six paces. \\"When I travel through my room,\\" he writes, \\"I rarely follow a straight line: I go from the table towards a picture hanging in a corner; from there, I set out obliquely towards the door; but even though, when I begin, it really is my intention to go there, if I happen to meet my armchair en route, I don‚Äôt think twice about it, and settle down in it without further ado.\\" Later, proceeding North, he encounters his bed, and in this way he lightheartedly continues his \\"Voyage\\". This work is remarkable for its play with the reader's imagination, along the lines of Laurence Sterne, whom Xavier admired. Xavier did not think much of Voyage, but his brother Joseph had it published. Most of his other works are of modest dimensions; these include * Le L√©preux de la Cit√© d'Aoste (\\"The Leper from Aosta,\\" 1811), a touching humane story in a simple style, involving a dialogue between a leper who reminisces with a soldier about his lost youth and his sequestered life in a tower with a view of the Alps, * Les Prisonniers du Caucase, (\\"The Prisoners of the Caucasus,\\" 1825) a powerful sketch of Russian character, * La Jeune Sib√©rienne, (\\"The Young Siberian,\\" 1825), a true story of who left on foot from Ishim in the depth of Siberia to go to Saint Petersburg to ask Tsar Alexander I for the grace of her father, and * Exp√©dition Nocturne Autour de ma Chambre (\\"Night Voyage Around My Room,\\" 1825), a sequel to Voyage Autour de ma Chambre. In 1839, after the publication of a French edition of La Jeune Sib√©rienne (1825) Maistre went on a long journey to Paris and Savoy. He was surprised to find himself well known in literary circles. Alphonse de Lamartine dedicated a poem to him (Retour, 1826) praising his genius: \\"the future sons will say [...] it is your heart, which through your mellifluous writings you have passed to us\\". He met Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve, who has left some pleasant reminiscences of him. For a time, he lived at Naples, but eventually he returned to St. Petersburg and died there in 1852.

St. Anthony serves as a main service centre for northern Newfoundland and southern Labrador. St. Anthony and surrounding area has an approximate population of 4,330. The population of the town itself was 2,258 in 2016, compared with 2,418 in 2011, 2,476 in 2006 and 2,730 in 2001. History The history of European settlement of St. Anthony reaches back to the early 16th century, when French and Basque fishermen used the well-sheltered harbour as a seasonal fishing station. By the time explorer Jacques Cartier came across the settlement in 1534, he reported it was named St. Anthony Haven. More people began arriving in the mid-19th century. By 1857, a census found 71 inhabitants in 10 families. By 1874, the population rose to 110, and by 1891, it was 139. The town grew in population after the arrival of Dr. Wilfred Grenfell in 1900 (see below). A salt fish plant and cold storage facility built in the 1930s and 1940s were a boon to the local economy. St. Anthony also became an outpost for the U.S. military. In 1951, a Pinetree Line radar site was built on a nearby hill, and by 1962, there were 250 servicemen stationed there. The site was operated by the 921st AC&W; Squadron. Tourism has become an important industry to the town as fishing stocks dwindled. Tourists come to visit historical sites related to Grenfell, to see the nearby Viking settlement at L'Anse aux Meadows or to see natural attractions such as icebergs and whales. Dr. Wilfred Grenfell St. Anthony's most influential historic figure is Dr. Wilfred Grenfell. Born on February 28, 1865, in northern England. Grenfell entered the London Hospital Medical School in 1883. While in London, Grenfell heard the American evangelist Dwight L. Moody. The event inspired him to a life of Christian charity. A member of the Royal National Mission To Deep Sea Fishermen, Grenfell was sent to investigate the conditions of fishermen in the Labrador region in 1892. He was said to be the first doctor to reach the region. He would later establish a string of hospitals, cooperatives and schools for people in remote Newfoundland and Labrador towns. He chose Red Bay as the headquarters of the Grenfell Mission in 1900. However, in later years the focus of the organization became St. Anthony. He began responsibility of health care for the more than thirty thousand residents in Northern Newfoundland and Southern Labrador. This health responsibility was maintained until 1981 when the Government bought the resources and took over responsibility for the health service for one dollar. Dr. Grenfell was most interested in the holistic approach to betterment of the lifestyle of the people of the province. He worked in areas of food production, craft production and sale. Grenfell also worked to provide funds for his religious mission through speaking tours throughout the United States and Europe and he used colorized slides of the people and places he was operating his mission. He began to work from a non denominational Christian belief structure and religious conversion was his goal. Although the religious based mission was successful he was supported by volunteers who gave service to the mission. One notable volunteer was Josephine Colgate of the Colgate fortune. Grenfell died in 1940 and his ashes were interred at Tea House Hill in St. Anthony with those of his wife Lady Anne Grenfell. DemographicsClimate St. Anthony experiences a subarctic climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Dfc) with long, cold winters and short, warm summers. However, owing to the strong maritime influence, the winters are less cold than most of Canada at the same latitude, and there is no permafrost especially with snow cover sometimes reaching as high as . However its winters are still far more severe than Valentia Island off the coast of Ireland half a latitude farther north on the other side of the Atlantic which enjoys the moderating effects of the Gulf Stream. St. Anthony is as much as colder than London on a near exact latitude in an average year. Precipitation, driven the powerful Icelandic Low, is quite high year round, with an annual average of approximately . Transportation The town is at the end of the Great Northern Peninsula Highway. It is also served by St. Anthony Airport. Attractions Grenfell Centre Grenfell Memorial Grenfell Museum * Is a popular tourist destination known for its whale watching. Dr. Wilfred Grenfell's work in St. Anthony is commemorated by several historic sites and museums, including: * Grenfell House Museum: Built between 1909 and 1910, it was the home of Dr. Grenfell, his wife Anne, and their three children. After Grenfell's retirement to Vermont, the house became a residence for mission workers. It opened as a museum in 1981. * Grenfell Interpretation Centre: Interprets the life and times of Dr. Wilfred Grenfell through a gallery of interpretative paneling and displays. The centre is designed to be self touring and to provide a more modern interpretative experience for visitors. * Tea House Hill: A 20-minute walking trail with interpretative panels and seating along the route. The trail leads to the top of the hill where Dr. Grenfell, his wife and other colleagues' ashes are buried. Other attractions include: * The Rotunda: A display of ceramic murals depicting the culture and history of the people of Newfoundland and Labrador. The mural was created by the acclaimed sculptor Jordi Bonet. * Dockhouse Museum: which currently is not in operation, Demonstrated to visitors how vessels of all sizes were pulled out of the water for repairs in the late 1920s. * L'Anse aux Meadows: A Norse village briefly inhabited around 1000 AD. The site was recognized as one of the world's major archaeological properties and is designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1978.

Chris O'Connor (born May 7, 1965) is a vocalist, guitarist, and bassist. His first band, The I-Rails, was formed with high school buddy, guitarist/songwriter Jeff Sparks in 1986. Together with drummer Tim Lauterio, The I-Rails made four albums in the course of a few years from the late 1980s up to 1991, none of which received much attention. The band officially broke up in 1991. Using material he and Sparks wrote for a planned fifth I-Rails album, O'Connor made the Rocket album entirely on his own on a broken-down 1969 Ampex 16-track tape deck and a budget of $1,000 and called himself Primitive Radio Gods, which is what would have been the band's last album title. The album wouldn't be released for four years however when it was picked up by Columbia Records, Germany. It was soon released with only minimal remixing and the single, \\"Standing Outside a Broken Phone Booth with Money in My Hand\\" shot up the charts and was featured in Jim Carrey's movie The Cable Guy. O'Connor reunited with The I-Rails under the new name. The band released a second album, White Hot Peach in late 2000 under a small independent label What Are Records?, and then a third album, minus Sparks, called Still Electric in 2003. Primitive Radio Gods released their fourth full-length album, Sweet Venus, on May 4, 2006. Currently the album is only available as a download on their website.

Ventimiglia (; , ; ; ) is a city, comune (municipality) and bishopric in Liguria, northern Italy, in the province of Imperia. It is located southwest of Genoa, and from the French-Italian border, on the Gulf of Genoa, having a small harbour at the mouth of the Roia River, which divides the town into two parts. Ventimiglia's urban area has a population of 55,000. Etymology The name derives from Ancient Ligurian , meaning \\"capital city of the Intemelii\\". The name was Latinized as , which later became and later still . This became Ventimiglia in Italian. The similarity to the phrase (\\"twenty miles\\") is coincidental,http://www.walksofitaly.com/blog/liguria/ventimiglia-italy although the town was almost exactly 20 statute miles from France between 1388 and 1860.  History  Ventimiglia is the ancient Albium Intemelium, the capital of the Intemelii, a Ligurian tribe . Albintimilium became a municipium in 89 BC. In AD 69 the city was sacked by the army of Otho and Vitellius, but recovered to remain prosperous into the 5th century, surrounded by walls with cylindrical towers built at each change of direction. In the Gothic Wars it was besieged by the Byzantines and the Goths, and later suffered from the raids of Rothari, King of the Lombards, but flourished again under Rodoald. In the 10th century it was attacked by the Saracens of Fraxinet. After a period as an independent commune, it was ruled by the Counts of Ventimiglia, and often had to fight with the Republic of Genoa. In 1139 the Genoese attacked it by land and sea and forced it to surrender; the count continued to hold the city and countship as a vassal of the victors. The city rebelled more than once against the Genoese and sided with their enemies. In 1271 in a war with Genoa its podest√† Luca Grimaldi was captured. Ventimiglia was thus temporarily held by the dukes of Savoy (1389 and 1746) and King Ladislaus of Naples (1410). In 1505 it was annexed to the Genoese Republic, sharing its history until the early 19th century. Roman theatre. In 1269 the Count of Ventimiglia, Gugliemo Pietro I Balbo married Eudossia Laskaris, daughter of Emperor Theodore II Laskaris.The History of the Col de Tenda, W.A.B. Coolidge, The English Historical Review, Vol. XXXI, ed. Reginald Lane Poole, (Longmans, Green and Co., 1916), 202. From them started the dynasty of the Lascaris of Tenda. They maintained the sovereign County of Tenda until 1501 when the last of them, Anne Lascaris, married Renato of Savoy (in French Ren√© de Savoie) and transferred the County to his cadet branch of Savoy dynasty. The most famous exponent of this branch of Lascaris was Beatrice of Tenda.  Main sights  View from bridge in Ventimiglia Remains of a Roman theatre (first half of the 2nd century) are visible, and remains of many other buildings have been discovered, among them traces of the ancient city walls, a fine mosaic, found in 1852 but at once destroyed, and a number of tombs to the west of the theatre. The ruins of the ancient Albintimilium are situated in the plain of Nervia, c. to the east of the modern town. The caves of the Balzi Rossi have proved rich in palaeolithic remains of the Quaternary period. Remains of a family of Cro-Magnon people were discovered, with several skeletons of men, women and children. Very important architecturally and historically is the ancient medieval city centre, perched on a hill overlooking the new town. The Church of San Michele Arcangelo was erected in the 10th century by the Counts of Ventimiglia on the foundations of a pagan temple. Later it was entrusted to the Benedictines of Lirins. In the 11th-12th centuries it was rebuilt in Romanesque style. In 1628 it lost the aisles after an earthquake. It houses milestones from the old Via Iulia Augusta, two of which are used as stoups and one supports the crypt's vault. The present Romanesque Cathedral dedicated to the Assumption, Cattedrale di Nostra Signora Assunta, with an 11th-century baptistery, see of the present Diocese of Ventimiglia-San Remo (just Ventimiglia until 1957, founded 670), is built on the ruins of an earlier Lombard church, which in turn was on the site of a Roman building, possibly a temple. The municipal library has the second largest collection of 17th- century manuscripts and books in Italy (the biggest collection is in Venice). The Giardini Botanici Hanbury (Hanbury Botanical Gardens), surrounding the villa of Sir Thomas Hanbury, La Mortola, are the biggest in Italy and among the finest in Europe, boasting many varieties of tropical and sub-tropical species that thrive in this mild climate. Near Ventimiglia are the Genoese fortresses of Castel d'Appio, Forte San Paolo and Fortezza dell'Annunziata.  Tourism  Ventimiglia is a popular summer destination for tourists on the French Riviera. Particularly popular all year with visitors from France is the weekly street market (held on a Friday), along the seafront of the new town, which causes major traffic congestion.  Transportation  Ventimiglia is on the Via Aurelia Provincial Road, and has a junction on the A10 Motorway. Its railway stations, connects the line from Genoa to France with the line to Cuneo.

Driveways rarely have traffic lights, but some that bear heavy traffic, especially those leading to commercial businesses and parks, do. Driveways may be decorative in ways that public roads cannot, because of their lighter traffic and the willingness of owners to invest in their construction. Driveways are not resurfaced, snow blown or otherwise maintained by governments. They are generally designed to conform to the architecture of connected houses or other buildings. Some of the materials that can be used for driveways include concrete, decorative brick, cobblestone, block paving, asphalt, gravel, decomposed granite, and surrounded with grass or other ground-cover plants. Driveways are commonly used as paths to private garages, carports, or houses. On large estates, a driveway may be the road that leads to the house from the public road, possibly with a gate in between. Some driveways divide to serve different homeowners. A driveway may also refer to a small apron of pavement in front of a garage with a curb cut in the sidewalk, sometimes too short to accommodate a car. Often, either by choice or to conform with local regulations, cars are parked in driveways in order to leave streets clear for traffic. Moreover, some jurisdictions prohibit parking or leaving standing any motor vehicle upon any residential lawn area (defined as the property from the front of a residential house, condominium, or cooperative to the street line other than a driveway, walkway, concrete or blacktopped surface parking space). Other examples include the city of Berkeley, California that forbids \\"any person to park or leave standing, or cause to be parked or left standing any vehicle upon any public street in the City for seventy-two or more consecutive hours.\\" Other areas may prohibit leaving vehicles on residential streets during certain times (for instance, to accommodate regular street cleaning), necessitating the use of driveways. Residential driveways are also used for such things as garage sales, automobile washing and repair, and recreation, notably (in North America) for basketball practice. Another form of driveway is a 'Run-Up', or short piece of land used usually at the front of the property to park a vehicle on.

He was a close associate of the Ferrara Estense court, and one of the most skilled representatives of the progressive secular style which developed there at the end of the 16th century.  Life  He was born in Ferrara, and spent most of his life there. He was the illegitimate son of Agostino Agostini, a singer and priest of Ferrara mostly active in the 1540s. Lodovico may have studied for a time in Rome, based on the evidence of a madrigal published there, and he became a priest. By 1572, he was singing in the chapel of Ferrara Cathedral, and by 1578 he was on the payroll of Duke Alfonso II d'Este, one of the most famous patrons of music of the late 16th century. Clearly Lodovico was a favorite of the Duke, and he remained in his service for the rest of his life. In the 1580s, he was a composition teacher to the Duke of Mantua, Guglielmo Gonzaga; Agostini dedicated a book of madrigals to him. Gonzaga went on to become a composer of madrigals himself, and in addition was a close associate of Palestrina. Agostini was on good terms with many members of the aristocracy, as well as the famous poets Tasso and Guarini, and other musicians at the court, including Luzzasco Luzzaschi, the most famous of the Ferrarese madrigalists. While retaining his association with the intensely secular Estense court, he also had a distinguished ecclesiastical career, eventually becoming a Monsignore and an apostolic protonotary.  Music and influence  Ferrara, in the 1580s and 1590s, was one of the most musically advanced and sophisticated places in Europe. Under the patronage of Duke Alfonso II d'Este the court developed into a place of musical experimentation, with a group of virtuoso female singers (the concerto di donne) available to an equally virtuoso group of composers, who included Luzzaschi, Agostini, and in the 1590s, Carlo Gesualdo. They all wrote music for the enjoyment of a small group of connoisseurs, including the Duke himself. In this rarefied atmosphere an avant-garde style of music flourished, and Agostini was one of the most musically daring of the group. In some ways the scene at Ferrara was reminiscent of the activity at Avignon in the late 14th century, which produced a musical style known as the ars subtilior; indeed the Ferrarese scene is reminiscent of certain 20th and 21st century movements. Agostini was fond of musical enigmas, puzzles, surprise and double-entendre, and his many musical collections display this. Enigmi musicali and L'echo, et enigmi musicali are canons to be solved by riddles, full of unusual chromatic progressions, instrumental interpolations, and other musical curiosities. Some of his books of madrigals are written in a virtuoso singing style obviously intended for the three current members of the concerto di donne (Laura Peverara, Anna Guarini, and Livia d'Arco). His third book of madrigals, for six voices (1582), appears to be the earliest collection of the actual repertory of this ensemble. Agostini was also a composer of accompanied solo song; since many of the performers at the court were instrumentalists in addition to singers (for example Livia d'Arco was a virtuoso player of the viol) he wrote for both lute and viol as accompaniment to solo singers. While no liturgical music by Agostini has survived (none may have been written), one of his last compositions is Le lagrime del peccatore, a setting of poems by Luigi Tansillo, as a set of madrigali spirituali; it is similar in intent, if not in musical means, to the set Lagrime di San Pietro by Orlando di Lasso, also based on poems by Tansillo. Agostini died in 1590, and in 1598 Alfonso died and Ferrara was absorbed into the Papal States, effectively ending the musical experimentation there.

The most typical Corps consists of: Brassline Soprano Bugles (High Pitched) Mellophone Bugles (Medium Pitched) Baritone Bugles (Mid-Low pitch) Contrabass Bugle (Bass Pitch) Marching Percussion Bass Drum High Tension Snare Drum Tenor Drums (quads) Static Percussion Arrangement of Static Orchestral Percussion instruments for instance: Marimba Xylophone Tubular bells Visual Members The visual section of a drum corps is referred to as the Colour Guard, these marching members are there purely for visual decoration. Using flags, wooden sabres and rifles as a norm, however on rare occasions a drum corps show can revolve around the colour guard performance with the use of props.

The team were dissolved as of 16 May 2006, but were later re-established with independence from Fulham F.C.. The club dissolved for a second time in June 2010 when sponsors pulled out following a second successive relegation. Fulham became the first Ladies' football team in Europe to turn full-time professional in April 2000.From BBC news However, club chairman Mohamed Al-Fayed reverted the club to semi-professional status three years later. However, the club reformed in 2014. History Fulham L.F.C. were seen as the successor club to Friends of Fulham, winners of the FA Women's Cup in 1985 and twice runners-up in 1989 and 1990. After they moved to become what is now AFC Wimbledon Ladies, Fulham F.C. re-established a women's team, with women's football becoming very popular by the early 1990s. Fulham L.F.C.'s debut came in 1993 in the Greater London Division, and they eventually reached the FA Women's National Premier League, via the Greater London Premier Division, the South East Combination League and the FA Women's Premier League Southern Division, mirroring the progress of the men's professional club. After becoming professional themselves in 2000, a huge investment paid dividends in their first season, 2000‚Äì01, as they reached the FA Women's Cup final and won the South East Combination Women's Football League by a comfortable margin. Star players like Rachel Yankey and Katie Chapman were supplemented by high-profile overseas imports like Marianne Pettersen. In the 2001‚Äì02 season, they won the FA Women's Premier League Southern Division, the London County Cup, the FA Women's Premier League Cup and the FA Women's Cup, scoring 342 goals and conceding just 15. Fulham won the treble of FA Women's Cup, League Cup and Premier League in 2002‚Äì03, scoring 68 goals and conceding just 13. In 2003‚Äì04 they were the only English team to compete in the UEFA Women's Cup, and they came second in the Premier League National Division, despite reverting to semi-pro status at the end of the previous season. During the 2005‚Äì06 season, having lost most of their professional squad, they struggled in the league and finished eighth. On 16 May 2006, Fulham FC announced that they were withdrawing the team from the Women's Premier League and discontinuing the team altogether. The decision to dissolve the team was made on financial grounds, with Fulham officially laying the blame on a poor media coverage and poor league attendance. Fulham did announce plans to continue its Girls Development Centre, but clearly stated they would not be fielding any further league teams in the foreseeable future. Following the withdrawal of the funding of the Ladies, Fulham FC let club officers, parents and players take over in order that the team could continue playing at the highest level of women's football ‚Äì the FA Women's Premier League. A similar fate befell several other ladies' teams at around the same time. As there was no remaining connection with Fulham FC, it was decided to alter the club's name to Fulham WFC and then WFC Fulham, in order to make this separation clear. The new committee was presented with a number of difficult problems to solve. Season 2006‚Äì2007 saw the club survive, albeit with the relegation of the first team from the Premier League National Division, but with the bonus of a County Cup final appearance. The team bounced straight back by winning the Premier League Southern Division in 2007‚Äì08, thanks largely to the goals of Ann-Marie Heatherson. In 2008‚Äì09, WFC Fulham finished 12th and were relegated from the National Division. Another relegation into the Combination League followed in 2009‚Äì10 and the club folded due to the withdrawal of their sponsors. A new official Fulham ladies team restarted in 2014.http://www.fulhamfc.com/ladies In 2014, the club reformed once more, as Fulham FC Foundation Ladies and entered the London & South East Regional Women's League. The club has remained in that division since, officially becoming re-incorporated into Fulham FC and rebranding as Fulham FC Women in 2018.

Life Unton was born at Wychwood and was the second son of Sir Edward Unton (d. 1583) of Wadley House, near Faringdon, Berkshire (now Oxfordshire). His mother Lady Anne Seymour (d. 1588) was a daughter of the Duke of Somerset, the Lord Protector under Edward VI.Description of the painting 'Sir Henry Unton' at the Tate His elder brother was Edward Unton, who died in 1589. Educated at Oriel College, Oxford, Unton became the member of parliament for New Woodstock in 1584. He served with the English forces in the Netherlands in 1585 and 1586, being present at the skirmish of Zutphen. In 1586 he was knighted by Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester.Haynes, Alan: The White Bear: The Elizabethan Earl of Leicester Peter Owen 1987 p. 77 In 1591, through the good offices of the earl of Essex, Unton was sent as ambassador to Henry IV of France; he became very friendly with this king and accompanied him on a campaign in Normandy before he was recalled to England in June 1592. Again securing a seat in 1593 in parliament as a knight of the shire for Berkshire, he lost for a short time the favour of Queen Elizabeth, but was sent that same year as ambassador to France. He died in the French camp at La F√®re on 23 March 1596, a collection of Latin verses being published in his memory at Oxford later in the year. This was edited by his chaplain, Robert Wright (1560‚Äì1643), afterwards bishop of Lichfield and Coventry. After his death, his body was returned to England and buried at All Saints' Church in Faringdon. Shortly afterwards his widow, Dame Dorothy Unton (n√©e Wroughton), commissioned an unknown artist to paint a very unusual portrait of Unton. In addition to showing the sitter as he appeared shortly before his death, the painting also uses a narrative style to show ten other important events in his life. The series begins with his birth and ends with his impressive funeral procession. The painting now resides at the National Portrait Gallery in London. She was later remarried to Sir George Shirley, 1st Baronet, and was known as Dame Dorothy Shirley.

However, expansion of the adjacent open-cut brown coal mine led to the closure and removal of the town in the 1980s. Whilst the township no longer exists, at the , the adjacent region classified as Yallourn had a population of 251.  Design  Often mistakenly thought to have been designed by Walter Burley Griffin, who planned Canberra, Australia's capital city, the town was planned by A.R. La Gerche, the State Electricity Commission's Architect. The design of Yallourn incorporated lessons learnt from the early UK garden cities of Welwyn Garden City and Letchworth Garden City inspired by Ebenezer Howard. The design of Yallourn established a formal central square adjacent to the shopping area and a formal \\"Broadway\\" bounded by parks between the shopping area and railway station. The whole town area was surrounded by a green belt varying between native vegetation, open parkland and sporting and recreational complexes. The majority of the land and buildings, with the exception of the churches and several minor properties, were owned by the S.E.C.V. Residents were charged below market rentals and the S.E.C.V. adopted the role of paternalistic landlord in addition to its role as employer to the majority of the town's income earners. The conflicts this created caused continuing concern throughout the life of the town. For the majority of the town's life, citizen involvement was limited, residents being represented in their dealings with the S.E.C.V. by a Town Advisory Council that was established in 1947. Houses within the town were constructed to a limited number of designs but these were varied by differing external detailing and surface finishes. A brick and tile manufacturing plant was built near the town and produced a characteristic terracotta roofing tile which was used to clad most homes. The pitch of the roof structure and overhanging eaves remained similar throughout the town, providing a common theme without the sameness characteristic of English garden city developments. The homes were placed on large plots, typically of 1000 m2, the design brief from General Sir John Monash, the initial S.E.C.V. chairman requiring that each plot should have sufficient land to permit the tenant to keep a horse and a garden. The town boasted outstanding public facilities many years in advance of similar rural or suburban communities of similar size, the majority funded by the S.E.C.V. A close community spirit developed within the town, in part through enthusiastic usage of the excellent facilities. External communications The Yallourn railway line was opened to the town in January 1922 as a branch junctioning at Hernes Oak on the main Gippsland railway; this line was replaced by a one on an easier gradient extending east from Moe in September 1953, which was electrified in 1955. The local railway station closed to passengers in the 1960s, with the line then being used primarily to haul briquettes from the Yallourn briquette factory. When the factory closed, the line was used to haul briquettes from the Morwell factory to Yallourn, as briquettes were used as the initial fuel when lighting the furnaces in the power station until enough steam was generated to dry the brown coal used as the main fuel. Closure of the line occurred in 1986 when the transport of briquettes shifted to trucks. Yallourn Post Office opened on 8 October 1923 (being renamed from Western Camp which opened the previous year) and closed in 1980 when the town was removed. An earlier Yallourn Post Office opened in 1921 and was renamed Eastern Camp in 1923. Another Western Camp Post Office opened in 1924 and closed in 1968.  Closure  Yallourn W Power Station led to the town's removal At its peak the town's population reached 5000. However, in 1968 the S.E.C. decided to demolish the town to make way for further mining. Despite an attempted green ban to save the town, by 1983 demolition was complete, the underlying brown coal reserves being used to feed the Yallourn W Power Station. Many of the people who were relocated from Yallourn built homes in Moe, Morwell, Newborough, Traralgon, Yallourn North and other surrounding towns in the Latrobe Valley. Many of the houses from the town were removed, either to these nearby towns, or on occasions moved further afield. The timber framed buildings were reclad, although most retained their characteristic Yallourn tiled roof. The S.E.C.V. developed some properties, particularly in small developments in nearby Newborough where Yallourn houses were removed and samples of the conversions that were possible were showcased. These transplanted Yallourn homes remain popular with former Yallourn residents. Sport Golfers play at the course of the Yallourn Golf Club on Golf Links Road in neighbouring Yallourn Heights. In 1951 Yallourn was the champion soccer club in the state of Victoria.http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/1951D1T.html In June 1952, during the 1952 VFL season, a senior Victorian Football League (VFL) game between Footscray and St Kilda was played at Yallourn Oval, with St Kilda being victorious. The match was organised as part of an effort by the Australian National Football Council (ANFC) to promote the sport, and the other matches in the round were played in Albury, Brisbane, Euroa, Hobart, and Sydney (all non-standard venues). The match in Yallourn was affected by rain, but still drew a crowd estimated at 3,500 people.Yallourn - All Games, AFL Tables. Retrieved 15 December 2016.

It is located on the coast, 5 km south of Monastir. Its population is estimated at around 11,000 as of 2014. Khniss is the hometown of the famous Tunisian linguist Abu Isaak Al Khounaysy who taught linguistics and grammar in the first islamic university and research center in Africa built by the Aghlabites in Kairouan according to the Tunisian historian Hassan Hosni Abdul-Wahab ABDUL-WAHAB (Hassan Hosni) 'Warakat'- (Papers) Studies of certain aspects of the Arab civilisation in Ifriquia (Tunisia) Tunis, Library al-Manar, 1972-1981 The exact significance of the word Khniss remains mysterious. Some invoke a possible meaning of Church as a deformation of the Arabic word \\"kanis\\", others suggest a link to the word \\"khounais\\" meaning depression in Arabic. Others reckon the city and its name are of Berber origins, however the word itself is not known. In Iraq there is an old historical Assyrian village with the name of Khinnis or khenis. Also in Morocco there is a village in a Berber area with the same name. Although this may give more credit to a version arguing for a Berber origin of the word, all these guesses and hints needs further investigations. The people of Khniss are known as peaceful, hard working, honest, and hospitable. The city is characterized by a disproportionately large number of brilliant teachers, academia, doctors, and engineers, all passionate and proud of their modest origins. History The city provided refuge to Arab and Muslim families evicted from Muslim Sicily (1061-1091) after the Norman conquest. Some sources mention the migrations of the Muslim Sicilians to Khniss in the 10th and 11th centuries in two waves. In the neighboring Monastir, there is the tomb of the very famous Muslim scholar Sidi El Mezri originating from Mazara in Sicily. Traditionally, the economic activity of the city was based on olive farming, fishing, stone quarries (which left some of the neighboring landscapes disfigured), and on handcraft textile. Khniss specialized in wool processing and in weaving different sorts of high quality traditional woolen blankets, such as \\"ferrachia\\" and \\"abena\\" ; dresses such as \\"barnous\\" and \\"kedroun\\"; carpets, rugs and \\"Klim\\", etc. Nowadays, the local economy is more diversified, but still dominated by an important export oriented textile industry, mostly for ready-made clothing. With the modern structure of the textile industry, the traditional woolen textile activity, which missed on the latest innovations and technologies, got a severe shock and its economic importance has declined.Effets des changements √©conomiques et socio-culturels sur le secteur de l'artisanat textile √† Khniss dans le Sahel tunisien / par Mongi Gardalli ; directeur de th√®se : Jean-Claude Rabier-Universit√© des sciences et technologies de Lille. There is a real threat that the traditional know-how in processing woolen textiles completely fades away. Geography Khniss is a coastal city which features the beginning of an amazing marine depression of shallow seabed that stretches till \\"Cap Dimass\\" in Bekalta, ancient Thapsus. From Khniss to Bekalta we can observe two distinct levels in the sea. The first one is a confined lagoon with no significant marine waves or currents and called by locals \\"Dead Sea\\"; the second has moderate currents and waves, and is usually referred to as the \\"Live Sea\\". In some parts of the shallow sea beds, remains of Roman mosaics can be contemplated near the sewage treatment plant of Lamta-Sayyada. Some elders have referred to the region as \\"Al Maklouba\\" in a reference to an old myth saying the region had known a major earthquake that critically changed the landscape in the lagoon. The lagoon of Khniss used to have a particularly rich marine biodiversity that until a recent past sustained pretty well the livelihood of local fishermen families. A traditional ecological fishing method known as \\"Demmassa\\" was widely employed in the region and used to be productive enough for all. However, in the last few decades, the lagoon witnessed a combination of serious environmental problems that are endangering its unique ecological equilibrium. Pollution, poor planning and the complete absence of sustainable preservation strategies are the main reasons of this environmental disaster. For instance, poor planning can be witnessed in the hastily built system that deviates the rain waters to protect the airport of Skanes-Monastir and the neighboring presidential summer palace. The construction of a sand barrier (Drina) in front of the drainage course of rain waters worsened the problems. The pollution due to urban and industrial waste waters further strangled the environment and is most probably the main reason for the depletion of the marine biodiversity of the lagoon. Ambitious and well though restoration plans are urgently needed so that the lagoon could recover its original beauty and provide a viable and welcoming habitat for marine species that once prospered in the lagoon.

Its proclamation was specifically mandated by article 59(4) of the Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which had been enacted on 15 December 1954. Together with the Island Regulation of the Netherlands Antilles ( or '), the Constitution describes the foundation of the government of the Netherlands Antilles. The region is still part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and hence has no autonomy over issues including defence, foreign policy, citizenship and extradition. However, like European Netherlands and Aruba it is autonomous over internal affairs and the three are constitutionally equal. The region has a federal government under which state governments operate, as described by the constitution. It sets out for a federal government of three parts: Governor of the Netherlands Antilles, representing the Monarch of the Netherlands; a Council of Ministers; and a four-year elected 22-member parliament. The Netherlands Antilles consists of five islands: Bonaire, Cura√ßao, Saba, St. Eustatius and St. Maarten. After referendums were held on all these islands, they are currently in the process to change their constitutional status. The dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles will be effective on October 10, 2010. On that date, Bonaire, Saba and St. Eustatius will continue as so called 'gemeentes', which means that they will become part of the country of the Netherlands. At the same time, Cura√ßao and St. Maarten will each obtain a separate status as a country in the Kingdom of the Netherlands, as is currently enjoyed by Aruba, which left the Netherlands Antilles in 1986.

History and production In December 1974, Norman Lear and his entertainment company, Tandem Productions, created a pilot for his new serial, Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman, a satire of the impact of American consumerism. The pilot, consisting of two episodes and shot on a $100,000 (equal to $ today) budget, was not picked up by the networks. Lear then pursued a syndication strategy by hiring a sales agent to sell the show at the 1976 National Association of Television Program Executives (NATPE) market in San Francisco. Needing a solution, Lear‚Äôs business contacts introduced him to James W. Packer Jr. and his company, Mission Argyle Productions. Packer devised a unique sales idea: invite the general managers from TV stations across America to Lear‚Äôs house in Los Angeles, where they would dine with him, hear his vision for the show, and begin the syndication dealmaking the following day. The next day KING-TV of Seattle became the first station to procure syndication rights to Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.

Premise Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman follows the titular character through increasingly complex and compounding life-events and scenarios often reflective of the changing social fabric of America in the 1970s. Some of the character's key traits, unusual, but prescient for the times, include her initially numbed-out response to conflicts both external and emotional, her indecisiveness, and her potential to suddenly snap out of one state of mind and swing to its opposite. Moral quandaries frequently seem on the verge of vanishing into apathy, until she is reminded of her love for her family and the need to keep them together. Mary Hartman, Mary Hartmans twisting, interwoven, elaborate plots and tongue-in-cheek melodrama lovingly lampooned the soap opera format in ways that set the stage for cult shows featuring plot labyrinths, like Soap and Twin Peaks. In its first episode, Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman introduced the Lombardi family of five, all of whom, along with their two goats and eight chickens, had been murdered by young Davey Jessup, an event witnessed by both Mary's daughter, Heather, and the \\"Fernwood Flasher\\", who turned out to be Mary's grandfather, Raymond Larkin. Other characters on the show also died in several unusual, even bizarre ways, including by being electrocuted in the bathtub (Jimmy Joe Jeeter), by drowning in chicken soup (Coach Leroy Fedders), and by being impaled on a pink bottle brush artificial Christmas tree (Garth Gimble). Mary Hartman had a nationally televised nervous breakdown on The David Susskind Show at the end of the first season. Mary then found herself in a psychiatric ward, where she was delighted to be part of their selected Nielsen ratings \\"family\\". One of her sanitarium mates, widowed Wanda Rittenhouse (Marian Mercer), would become more prominent later on when she married Merle Jeeter, the mayor of Fernwood. Legal issues In 1976, Lasser was arrested at a Los Angeles charity boutique, and police found $6 worth (or 88 milligrams) of cocaine in her purse. Authorities were called after Lasser's American Express card was denied and she refused to leave without possession of a $150 dollhouse. Lasser was initially apprehended for two unpaid traffic tickets (one for jaywalking), but the officers then found the cocaine in her handbag, and she claimed the drug had been given to her several months earlier by a fan. Lasser was ordered to six months in counseling, which was easily satisfied as she was already seeing an analyst. A fictionalized version of Lasser's refusal to leave a store without a dollhouse was incorporated into Mary Hartmans first season.Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman Episode #1.128 (TV Episode 1976): Plot Summary. Internet Movie Database. Accessed 8 October 2019. Legacy In 1976, Ted Morgan assessed in The New York Times: \\"The dreams and nightmares of the American people are reflected darkly through the glass of Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman....No longer merely a television program, Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman has become a cultural event, in the same league as those other sociological signposts that culture watchers...are always on the lookout for to help us explain ourselves.\\" Of the series' influence on pop culture, Claire Barliant also writes: \\"For some, the 1970s...was a descent into chaos, a dissolution of self, but also a kind of awakening....The Seventies' nervous breakdown coincides with women's lib and a strengthening gay rights movement....MH2 is relevant today because it entertains but still shocks, because the social commentary and satire and bravery of the show are as fresh as ever.\\" In 2000, Lasser appeared on a panel with her former MH2 cast and crew members at the Paley Center for Media in Beverly Hills. The seminar, entitled Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman: Reunion, Reunion, was moderated by Steven A. Bell and taped for the museum archives. In 2004 and 2007, Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman was ranked #21 and #26 on \\"TV Guides Top Cult Shows Ever\\". Forever Fernwood When Lasser left the show in 1977, it was re-branded Forever Fernwood and followed the trials and tribulations of Mary's family and friends after she had run away with a policeman, the aforementioned Sgt. Dennis Foley, with whom she had had a lot of contact during the first season. Aside from Lasser, the rest of the cast remained intact even while additional actors became part of the cast: Shelley Fabares as Eleanor Major, who began dating Tom after Mary had left him; Judith Kahan as Eleanor's stuttering sister, Penny Major; and Randall Carver as Cathy Shumway's gangster husband, Jeffrey DeVito. On the very last episode of the series Penny married Tom Hartman. Forever Fernwood ended in 1978, after 26 weeks on the air (130 half- hour episodes). Spin-offs During the summer of 1977, Fernwood 2 Night, a local talk show satire and parody starring Martin Mull as Barth Gimble, was broadcast as a spin-off/summer replacement for Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman. It went \\"nationwide\\" as America 2-Night in the spring of 1978. Home media=VHS *The Best of Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman ‚Äì Volume I. Videocassette.

She was the largest ship built by King James IV of Scotland as part of his policy of building a strong Scottish navy. She was ordered around 1505 and laid down in 1507 under the direction of Captain Sir Andrew Wood of Largo and the master shipwright Jacques Terrell, launched on 12 October 1511 and completed on 18 February 1512. She was too large to be built at any existing Scottish dockyard, so was built at the new dock at Newhaven. When Michael was launched she was the largest ship afloat, with twice the original displacement of her English contemporary Mary Rose, which was launched in 1509 and completed in 1510. The poet William Dunbar wrote of her construction: Translation: The chronicler Lindsay of Pitscottie wrote of the building of Michael that \\"all the woods of Fife, except Falkland wood, besides all the timber that was got out of Norway\\" went into her construction.Aeneas Mackay, Historie and Cronicles of Scotland, by Robert Lindesay of Pitscottie, vol. 1 (STS: Edinburgh, 1899), p. 251. Account books add that timbers were purchased from other parts of Scotland, as well as from France and the Baltic Sea. Lindsay gives her dimensions as long and in beam. Russell (1922) notes that Michael was supposed to have been built with oak walls thick. She displaced about 1,000 tons, had four masts, carried 24 guns (purchased from Flanders) on the broadside, 1 basilisk forward and 2 aft, and 30 smaller guns (later increased to 36 main guns), and had a crew of 300 sailors, 120 gunners, and up to 1,000 soldiers. Henry VIII of England was unwilling to be outdone, and ordered the building of the 1000-ton Henry Grace √† Dieu, launched in roughly 1512, later known as Great Harry, which was even larger. These ships were the first great ships, the precursors of the later ship of the line. Model of Great Michael, Burntisland Kirk, Fife Michael was named after the archangel Michael and built to support a Scottish crusade against the Ottoman Empire to reclaim Palestine for Christendom. This grandiose plan had to be changed when the commitments of the Auld Alliance with France required Scotland to go to war with England, to divert England from her war with Louis XII of France (see the Italian Wars). In August 1513 a Scottish invasion force was assembled to attack English possessions in France. Commanded by James Hamilton, 1st Earl of Arran, the chief ships were Michael, Margaret and James. Instead of attacking the English, Arran raided Carrickfergus in Ireland and returned with loot before proceeding to France. A warship of this size was costly to maintain, particularly for a small country such as Scotland. After James IV and many of the nobility of Scotland were killed at the Battle of Flodden in September 1513, Michael was sold to Louis XII of France on 2 April 1514 for the bargain price of 40,000 livres and became known as \\"La Grande Nef d'Ecosse\\" (The Big Nave of Scotland) (Nave is from the medieval Latin navis, meaning 'ship'). In March 1514 Michael was reported to be docked at Honfleur because she was too big for the harbour at Dieppe. Most historians have accepted the account of the Scottish historian George Buchanan that after this, the French allowed her to rot at Brest. Norman MacDougall in 1991 suggested that under her new French name she may have taken part in the Battle of the Solent in 1545, the French attack on England that led to the sinking of the Mary Rose.

Born in Ayr, Scotland, Murray had formed the company Murray International Metals Limited by the age of 23. The company grew to include steel distribution, mining and property development. Murray is perhaps best known for his ownership of Scottish football club Rangers F.C. which he purchased for ¬£6 million in 1988. While owner, the club won 15 League Championships and 26 Cups. Murray stepped down as chairman in 2009, and was replaced by Alastair Johnston. Early life and education Born in Ayr on 14 October 1951, Murray was educated at Ayr Academy, Belmont High School, Fettes College and Broughton High School. By the age of 23 Murray had formed Murray International Metals Limited, which was to become a leading distributor of structural steel. Business career Subsequently, the Murray Group of companies grew with some saying it became one of the United Kingdom's most successful privately owned enterprises. Added to the core business of steel were interests in surface mining (GM Mining), commercial property development (Premier Property Group), venture capital (Charlotte Ventures) and call centres (RHL, trading as 'RESPONSE' from February 2007 onwards, formerly Response Handling Limited). In 2006, the Murray group collectively reported turnover of ¬£550 million, representing a fivefold increase on the figure five years previously, largely as a result of growing involvement in property development. Unfortunately the global recession of 2007/2008 impacted on the companies growth and in September 2009 the group registered a huge loss of some ¬£226 million following a write down in the value of much of its property portfolio. Over the following years the group's losses continued as it struggled to bring down its debt with asset sales and debt for equity swaps by its bankers (the part publicly owned Lloyds Bank through its HBOS subsidiary). Murray is currently the Chairman of Murray Capital, a private investment company which is wholly owned by the Murray family. The company was established in 2000 and invests primarily in traditional economy businesses with a preference for industrial sectors including manufacturing, engineering and oil & gas. Murray Estates, a subsidiary of Murray Capital, is a property development and investment company focusing on identifying and delivering value to prime strategic residential and commercial land. Alongside his high-profile business activities, other Murray interests have helped cement his prominence in Scottish life. Football business =Acquiring Rangers Murray's involvement in football has overshadowed his business and personal lives and explains much of his prominence within Scottish society. In the 1980s Murray made a bid for Ayr United which was rejected by shareholders of the club. This setback saw Murray focus attention on acquiring Rangers, a club which, following the appointment of Graeme Souness as manager in 1986, had regained its ascendancy in Scottish football. Attracted by the idea of owning one of Scotland's highest-profile football clubs, on 23 November 1988 Murray secured the purchase of Rangers from the club's then owner, the Nevada-based Lawrence Marlborough, for a sum of ¬£6,000,000. Chairmanship Throughout what was later to transpire as his first period of chairmanship, Murray continued and extended the ambitious strategy he had inherited from David Holmes. His investment saw further development to Ibrox Stadium, which had already undergone extensive remodelling in the aftermath of the Ibrox disaster of 2 January 1971, which claimed the lives of 66 fans following an Old Firm derby with Celtic. Murray oversaw the construction of a third tier on the existing Main Stand, raising the ground's capacity by 7,300. Accompanying this were changes on the pitch. In 1989 Rangers secured their first trophy under Murray's chairmanship and the first of what was to become nine successive League Championships between the period 1989-1997. This period was to be significant for more reasons than footballing success. In 1989 Murray and the then manager Graeme Souness signed Mo Johnston, the first high-profile Catholic to play for the club since the Second World War, from French club Nantes for ¬£1.5 million. Since Johnston had previously played for Celtic and had recently committed to re-join them, the transfer to Rangers instead was highly controversial. Other high-profile players were to follow in later years, including Paul Gascoigne, Brian Laudrup, Ronald de Boer and Tore Andr√© Flo. Period of success Following Graeme Souness‚Äô departure to Liverpool in April 1991, Murray appointed his former assistant Walter Smith as manager. Under Smith, and his eventual replacement in 1998 by Dick Advocaat, Rangers embarked upon a sustained period of success that saw the club win eleven league championships over fourteen years. This domestic domination was not accompanied by success in European competition. Aside from the 1992-93 UEFA Champions League campaign, in which Rangers twice came within one victory of reaching the final, the club's record in Europe from 1989 was one of under-performance upon the expectation. In 2005-06 Rangers secured qualification from the group stage of the Champions League, becoming the first Scottish side to reach the last-sixteen knockout stage of the competition in its current format. In 2007-08, Rangers reached the final of the UEFA Cup but lost 2-0 to FC Zenit at the City of Manchester Stadium.\\"Zenit St Petersburg 2-0 Rangers\\" BBC Sport. 14 May 2008. Rangers went on, however, to win a Cup Double, of the Scottish League Cup, and the Scottish Cup. In 2001-02, Murray abandoned his previous insistence that Rangers would never leave Scottish football, arguing in support of a move by the Old Firm to the better-resourced English leagues, and ultimately the Premier League. This, Murray and others argued, would provide substantially increased income from growing television revenues, and with it the potential for the club to operate in a more competitive environment which could help boost performance in European competitions.\\"Desmond leads Old Firm push to move south\\" The Telegraph. 12 May 2002. Due to allegations of Rangers running an undeclared payment system outside of player contracts and therefore improperly registering players with the football authorities, the possibility arose of titles won by Rangers during Murray's reign being revoked. Murray strongly denied claims of any wrongdoing during his stewardship. A Scottish Premier League independent commission took place 2013 into alleged \\"undisclosed payments\\" by Rangers. It found that Rangers had deliberately failed to disclose the trust payments in order to withhold information from HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) and fined the old company ¬£250,000. It had been anticipated that the investigation would revoke honours won by Rangers during the period that the trust payments were made (five League titles, four Scottish Cups and five League Cups), but this was not done because it was considered that Rangers had not obtained any sporting advantage by withholding information. Finances In a quest to fulfil Murray's ambitions for Rangers in Europe, a period of unprecedented spending under the managership of Dick Advocaat saw the club's debts increase. As anticipated television revenues failed to materialise and the club's income failed to offset the growing cost of transfer fees and player salaries. Murray said; \\"For every five pounds Celtic spend, we will spend ten,\\"Rangers chief is fully aware he has made errors, but he defends his running of club, The Scotsman, 16 January 2009 in 1998. By 2001, with the appointment of Alex McLeish as manager, Murray acknowledged that mistakes were made, saying \\"we got it wrong. We obviously spent far too much money. We can't let it happen again because that would be total mismanagement.\\" A radical programme of cost-cutting was instituted in an attempt to re-establish the club on a stable financial footing. In 1996, ENIC Group invested ¬£40 million in Rangers. However, disagreements with Murray over transfer spending led to ENIC's Howard Stanton resigning from the club's board of directors in May 1999. ENIC announced plans to sell their 20.2% stake in Rangers in February 2001, but after failing to find a buyer they sold to Murray for ¬£8.9 million in August 2004. In February 1999, with Rangers' debts mounting, the Bank of Scotland took a 7% stake in the club and secured a charge over the club's income and assets should it default on its repayments. In October 2009 Walter Smith admitted that the bank had taken control from Murray and that all the club's players had been available for transfer since the previous January. In April 2010 the bank increased its stake in Murray International Holdings to 24%, arranging a debt-for-equity swap after the firm suffered further huge losses. On 5 July 2002, Murray had relinquished the chairmanship and limited his day-to-day involvement in the club's running. His status as by far the club's biggest share-holder remained. On 1 September 2004, Murray announced his return to the chairmanship, and with it a rights- issue to raise ¬£50 million with which to reduce the club's debt. In doing so, Murray also saw his shareholding in the club increase to around 90% of the total stock. Murray has claimed that he invested ¬£100 million of his own money into Rangers while owner. Since selling Rangers, the financial management during David Murray's reign at Rangers has come under even more criticism due to the club's entry into liquidation in February 2012. Murray sold Rangers to Craig Whyte who has maintained a stance of blaming the previous regime led by Murray for the club's problems, particularly in relation to a potential heavy tax bill brought about by the use of Employee Benefit Trusts. Murray, however, has played down his role in the club's financial meltdown and also denied allegations of \\"cheating\\", in relation to Rangers' use of EBTs, taking place during his time as owner. The First Tier Tax Tribunal to decide Rangers' and Murray International Holdings' appeal against a ¬£74 million tax bill claimed by HMRC due to the use of EBTs announced a verdict on 20 November 2012, with Rangers and MIH winning the appeal on a majority verdict. After the verdict, Murray expressed dismay at the damage caused to Rangers by the case before it had reached a decision, while also confirming a settlement of over ¬£10 million had been offered to HMRC two years previously. He also questioned HMRC's handling of his successor Craig Whyte's actions, who had stopped paying tax and national insurance at the club which eventually led to the liquidation of Rangers' previous holding company. In the wake of the tribunal verdict, Murray International Holdings called for a police enquiry into leaked information relating to the tax tribunal proceedings, leaks that resulted in a BBC documentary and an online blog making \\"confidential information\\" public. Legal action against the leaks by Murray is now underway. Sale of Rangers By 2006, Murray was considering ending his involvement with Rangers. Murray himself continued to articulate a more ambiguous stance on his desire to sell or retain ownership of the club: \\"It's not a 'For Sale' sign per se, but obviously I don't want to do this forever.\\" Murray announced on 26 August 2009 that he was again to step down as chairman of Rangers Football Club for personal reasons. In June 2010 Murray announced that the club was no longer actively seeking a buyer. At the time, the club and its parent company Murray International Holdings were subject to an investigation from HMRC into a tax issue, to do with payments made into offshore bank accounts. On 6 May 2011 it was confirmed that Murray had sold his controlling interest in the club (85.3 percent) to Wavetower Limited for ¬£1, subject to full repayment of the existing ¬£18 million overdraft to the Bank of Scotland, provision of ¬£5 million for investment in new playing staff per year for 4 years, and ¬£7 million for additional working capital facilities and stadium improvements. Wavetower Limited is owned by the company Liberty Capital which in turn is ultimately owned by businessman Craig Whyte. Due to the subsequent financial meltdown of the club Murray's decision to sell to Whyte came under scrutiny, but he claimed to have been \\"duped\\" during the process.  Rugby sponsorship  On 3 September 2007, Scottish Rugby announced that Sir David Murray would replace The Famous Grouse as the new sponsor of the Scotland national rugby team in a deal worth ¬£2.7 million over an initial 3-year term which was subsequently extended by one year. Personal life Murray's achievements in business have come in spite of the personal tragedy of the loss of both legs in 1976, following a serious car crash after a rugby match. Murray became a longstanding supporter of amputees, reflected in his establishment of the Murray Foundation in 1996. On 7 November 2006, 10 years to the day after its launch, Sir David Murray accepted The Queen's Award for Voluntary Service awarded to The Murray Foundation. Further personal tragedy followed with the death of Murray's wife Louise in 1992 from cancer. They had two sons, David (b. 1973) and Keith (b. 1975). Murray's main interests include watching sport, collecting and producing wine. He owns two vineyards in France, Chateau Routas which is in Provence and Domaine Jessiaume in Burgundy. He was awarded Chevaliers du Tastevin in 2006 and has received numerous awards for his wines. In June 2011 Sir David married former lawyer Kae Tinto at his Dunbarney Estate in Perthshire. They split in 2018 after seven years. Former Rangers owner Sir David Murray to separate from wife Kae Tinto after seven years of marriage Honours Murray has been recognised through a number of awards over the course of his career. In 1984, at the age of 33, he was awarded Young Scottish Businessman of the Year. In 1986, he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University. Murray was knighted in the 2007 New Years Honours List, for services to business in Scotland. After being named on the honours list, Murray received his knighthood from Queen Elizabeth on 4 July 2007 at a ceremony at Holyrood Palace. In December 2008 Sir David received his Honorary Degree of Doctor honoris causa from The University of Edinburgh at a ceremony held in the McEwan Hall, Edinburgh.

Like Casper the Friendly Ghost and Hot Stuff the Little Devil, Wendy is an opposite-type character, a girl witch who does good deeds. Publication history Wendy was introduced as a back-up feature as well as a companion for Casper in Casper the Friendly Ghost #20, May 1954. Casper met and befriended her after stopping a major battle between the witches and ghosts. Soon, she was trialed in Harvey Hits, starting with #7. After a total of six appearances, she received her own title, Wendy the Good Little Witch, in August 1960. Other ancillary titles featuring the pleasant young witch include Wendy Witch World (October 1961 to September 1974), and Casper and Wendy (September 1972 to November 1973). Another Wendy the Good Little Witch comic ran from April 1991 to August 1994, and a three-issue Wendy the Good Little Witch and New Kids on the Block saw print in 1991. In addition to Casper, the Wendy comics frequently feature Wendy's \\"aunties\\", Thelma, Velma and Zelma, with whom she shares a cottage in a haunted forest. The story \\"Remember When\\"Wendy the Good Little Witch #65, February 1971 recounts how Wendy was abandoned as a baby on their doorstep. The sisters tried to raise her to practice black magic, but Wendy consistently called on good spirits for white magic, frustrating her aunties. Unlike Wendy, her aunts have green wartish skin of the type associated with Halloween witches. One story states that the reason for this is because witches don't get enough sleep.Casper Digest #2 \\"The Secret of Oddella / Rude Awakening\\" December 1986 Like many of Harvey's stable, Wendy is a design variation on the prototype of Casper. So are Richie Rich, Gloria Glad, Little Dot and others. She has appeared in various other media including television and film. In other media Wendy made her first screen appearance in the theatrical Paramount Casper cartoon short, Which is Witch (1958), where she was voiced by Mae Questel. In 1963, she became a frequent supporting character in the animated TV series, The New Casper Cartoon Show, and was voiced by Norma MacMillan (who also voiced Casper). Christina Ricci's character of Kat in Universal's Casper movie was originally named Wendy in the script, but to avoid having to purchase the rights to the Wendy character, the name was changed at the last minute. The film does, however, show several hints that the character was originally Wendy, such as the red hoodie Kat wears in the film during one scene that resembles Wendy's robe from the comics. She serves as a co-protagonist in the 1998 direct-to- video prequel movie Casper Meets Wendy. In this movie, she was portrayed by a young Hilary Duff. TDK published a video game Wendy: Every Witch Way for the Game Boy Color in 2001. Wendy also appears in the video games Casper: Spirit Dimensions, released in 2001 for PlayStation 2 and the following year for Nintendo Gamecube, and Casper and the Ghostly Trio, released for PS2 in 2007. In the finale of \\"Harvey Girls Forever,\\" she is mentioned by Richie Rich as a potential new resident to Harvey Street.

As noil is a relatively short fiber, fabric made from noil is weaker and considered less valuable.  Silk  Silk noil may also be made from the short fibres, directly sourced from the silkworm cocoons. Rather than the continuous length of silk, shorter fibers, which are generally not used to create high quality silk, are used for silk noil, which has a slightly rough texture. It is relatively weaker and has low resilience. It tends to have very low lustre, which makes it appear more like cotton than silk. Noil silk has the advantage of being made from protein. Thus, it has a better texture and depth that cotton and gives a nice fall and drape. Silk noil is also blended or appended with heavier fabrics like velvets and satins to create varied textures. Made out of the strongest natural fibres (with a protein base) around, noil saris are not slippery like synthetic fibres and absorb moisture well. Noils are easily dyed and can also be made waterproof by using a polyurethane coating. This also increases their usage in furnishings industry. Silk noil hails from China from where it was exported to Europe in the middle ages especially to Italy. It was used to create silk blends, through the first half of the 14th century. However, over time its use decreased. With an increase in demand and variety of alternatives and low-cost substitutes, Noil has re-surfaced, experiencing a sort of revival. In India, noil is used to make sarees, materials and furnishings.

The term originally denoted the action of Harmodius and Aristogeiton, who are often called the Tyrannicides, in killing Hipparchus of Athens in 514 BC. Political theory Tyrannicide can also be a political theory and, as an allegedly justified form of the crime of murder, a dilemmatic case in the philosophy of law, and as such dates from antiquity. Support for tyrannicide can be found in Plutarch's Lives, Cicero's De Officiis, and Seneca's Hercules Furens. Plato describes a violent tyrant as the opposite of a good and \\"true king\\" in the Statesman, and while Aristotle in the Politics sees it as opposed to all other beneficial forms of government, he also described tyrannicide mainly as an act by those wishing to gain personally from the tyrant's death, while those who act without hope of personal gain or to make a name for themselves are rare.Aristotle, Politics X Various Christian philosophers and theologians also wrote about tyrannicide. In Thomas Aquinas's commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, Aquinas gave a defense not only of disobedience to an unjust authority, using as an example Christian martyrs in the Roman Empire, but also of \\"one who liberates his country by killing a tyrant.\\"For Aquinas, \\"when what is ordered by an authority is opposed to the object for which that authority was constituted ... not only is there no obligation to obey the authority, but one is obliged to disobey it, as did the holy martyrs who suffered death rather than obey the impious commands of tyrants.\\" One may even be \\"praised and rewarded\\" for being the \\"one who liberates his country by killing a tyrant.\\" Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, trans. J.G. Dawson (Oxford, 1959), 44, 2 in O‚ÄôDonovan, p. 329-30. The Monarchomachs in particular developed a theory of tyrannicide, with Juan de Mariana describing their views in the 1598 work De rege et regis institutione, in which he wrote, the philosophers and theologians agree, that the prince who seizes the state with force and arms, and with no legal right, no public, civic approval, may be killed by anyone and deprived of his life...\\" Benjamin Franklin's suggestion for the Great Seal of the United States included the phrase \\"Rebellion to Tyrants is Obedience to God.\\" The Jesuistic casuistry developed a similar theory, criticized by Blaise Pascal in the Provincial Letters.Ganns, H. G. \\"The Jesuits and Tyrannicide,\\" The American Catholic Quarterly Review, Vol. XXVII, 1902. Before them, the scholastic philosopher John of Salisbury also legitimised tyrannicide, under specific conditions, in the Policraticus, circa 1159. His theory was derived from his idea of the state as a political organism in which all the members cooperate actively in the realization of the common utility and justice. He held that when the ruler of this body politic behaves tyrannically, failing to perform his characteristic responsibilities, the other limbs and organs are bound by their duty to the public welfare and God to correct and, ultimately, to slay the tyrant. In 1408 the theologian Jean Petit used biblical examples to justify tyrannicide following the murder of Louis I, Duke of Orleans by Petit's patron John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy. Petit's thesis was extensively discussed and eventually condemned by the church. A Shone Treatise of Politike Power, written by John Ponet in 1556, argued that the people are custodians of natural and divine law, and that if governors and kings violated their trust, then they forfeited their power, whether they relinquished their positions voluntarily or whether they had to be removed forcefully. The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates by John Milton in 1649 also described the history of tyrannicide, and a defense of it when appropriate. Cambridge's David George has also argued that terrorism is a form of tyranny of which tyrannicide is a negation. Abraham Lincoln believed that assassinating a leader is morally justified when a people has suffered under a tyrant for an extended period of time and has exhausted all legal and peaceful means of ouster. History { align=right Statue of Harmodius and Aristogeiton } Throughout history, many leaders have died under the pretext of tyrannicide. Hipparchus, one of the last Greek leaders to use the title of \\"tyrant,\\" was assassinated in 514 BC by Harmodius and Aristogeiton, the original tyrannicides. Since then \\"tyrant\\" has been a pejorative term, lacking objective criteria. Many rulers and heads of state have been considered as such by their enemies but not by their adherents and supporters. For example, when John Wilkes Booth assassinated Abraham Lincoln in 1865, he wrote how he considered Lincoln a tyrant while comparing himself to Marcus Junius Brutus, who stabbed the Roman dictator Julius Caesar in 44 BC. It worth noting that Booth, his father, and his brother were all well-known thespians, best-known for their performances in productions of Julius Caesar by William Shakespeare. The famous line from Julius Caesar: \\"sic semper tyrannis,\\" was even yelled by Booth after assassinating President Lincoln. Tyrannicides have a poor record of achieving their intended outcome. Caesar's death, for example, failed to bring a return to republican power, and instead led to the Roman Empire, but it galvanized later assassins. Several of Caesar's successors (Roman Emperors) came to their demise by assassinations, including Caligula, who was stabbed in 41 by Cassius Chaerea and other Praetorian Guards, and Domitian, stabbed in 96 by a steward of Flavia Domitilla named Stephanus. Many attempts on Commodus's life in the late 2nd century failed, including the one instigated by his own sister Lucilla, but he ultimately fell victim to his own excess by a successful murderous coup.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 71.1, 3; 73.4.4-5. Other emperors assassinated from within include Claudius, Marcus Aurelius, and Severus Alexander. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, tyrannicide continued in the Byzantine Empire when Emperor Andronikos I Komnenos, was tied to a pillar, beaten, and dismembered by a mob in 1185. Tyrannicide has also been connected to revolution, with many taking place during successful revolutions, and others sparking revolutionary upheavals. In the midst of the French Revolution, Maximilien Robespierre, took power as the President of the National Convention, but after leading the Reign of Terror from 1793 to 1794, he was executed by beheading by the National Convention. The Romanian Revolution, one of the Revolutions of 1989, enabled a group of defected soldiers to capture Nicolae Ceau≈üescu, the country's communist leader, and to stage a trial after which he was executed by a firing squad of paratroopers Ionel Boeru, Georghin Octavian and Dorin-Marian Cirlan. Many assassins have been killed in the act, such as Rigoberto L√≥pez P√©rez, who shot Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza Garc√≠a in 1956. Claus von Stauffenberg tried to kill Adolf Hitler on 20 July 1944, was sentenced to death by an impromptu court martial and executed a few hours after the attempted murder. Others were prosecuted for the killing: Antonio de la Maza and his conspirators were executed after their shooting of Rafael Trujillo, dictator of the Dominican Republic in 1961, as was Kim Jaegyu, who shot South Korean dictator Park Chung-hee in 1979. Five of the members of Young Bosnia who were involved with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo were sentenced to death by hanging, while eleven were sentenced to various years in prison, including Gavrilo Princip who fired the fatal shot. Khalid Islambouli was one of three members of Egyptian Islamic Jihad executed for the assassination of Anwar Sadat, the autocratic President of Egypt in 1981. Even both Hipparchus's assassins were themselves killed, Harmodius on the spot and Aristogeiton after being tortured, and the major conspirators in the plot to kill Caesar were likewise killed or forced to commit suicide. Outright revolt was the context for other tyrannicides, and allowed individual killers to escape or remain anonymous. During World War II and the Italian resistance movement, Walter Audisio claimed to have led his team of partisans in the abduction and execution by firing squad of Benito Mussolini in 1945. The circumstances remain clouded, though Audisio was later elected to both the Italian Chamber of Deputies and the Italian Senate. In 1990, Samuel Doe, the President of Liberia was tortured to his death. In 1996, during their takeover of Afghanistan, Taliban soldiers captured Mohammad Najibullah, the President of the Soviet-backed Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, and dragged him to death. Saddam Hussein, President of Iraq was executed in 2006. During the 2011 Libyan civil war, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, the self-titled \\"Brother Leader and Guide of the Revolution,\\" was killed in the Battle of Sirte, in unclear circumstances. Literature Tyrannicide is a popular literary trope. Many works of fiction deal with the struggle of an individual or group of individuals to overthrow and kill an unjust tyrant. Often the tyranny is caused by an usurper to a royal throne, where the conclusion restores the proper heir. Children's literature frequently deals with the subject. Folk tales like The Nutcracker include the act, as do some video games series, like The Legend of Zelda and Star Fox. Examples in Disney animation include The Lion King and Aladdin which both involve the tyrannical takeover of a monarchy and its overhaul. Fantasy works like The Lord of the Rings, The Chronicles of Narnia, The Brothers Lionheart, A Song of Ice and Fire and science-fiction series like Star Wars and Doctor Who all deal with the killing of tyrants. Besides Julius Caesar, a number of William Shakespeare's plays deal with the subject, including Hamlet, Macbeth, and Richard III. The Italian dramatist, poet and philosopher Vittorio Alfieri devoted much of his work to this issue.G√©rard Chalian, Arnaud Blin, The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to Al Qaeda, p.82, 2007.

This trail is located in inland central Alameda and Contra Costa counties, mostly following a Southern Pacific Railroad right of way established in 1891 and abandoned in 1977. The two counties purchased the right of way at that time, intending to use it as a transportation corridor; the Iron Horse Trail was first established in 1986. In 2003, BART proposed to also use the right-of-way for a DMU line from Walnut Creek station to Tracy via Pleasanton. The trail passes through the cities of Pleasanton, Dublin, San Ramon, Danville, Alamo, Walnut Creek, Pleasant Hill and Concord. When completed, the trail will span from Livermore in central Alameda County to Suisun Bay at the northern edge of Contra Costa County, a distance of over connecting two counties and nine communities. The trail also directly connects to both the Dublin/Pleasanton and Pleasant Hill BART stations. The trail is maintained by the East Bay Regional Park District. It is a wheelchair accessible paved trail along with adjacent unpaved or soft trails in certain areas.http://www.ebparks.org/parks/trails/iron_horse The Iron Horse Regional Trail has several bridges over busy thoroughfares to help improve traffic flow; two notable ones cross over Ygnacio Valley Road in Walnut Creek and Treat Boulevard in Contra Costa Centre. Additional bridges are in the planning process. Despite initial skepticism, and even opposition, the trail is now a major transportation and recreation corridor. One million trips are made each year on the path. Pleasanton/Alameda County segments Construction of Iron Horse Regional Trail through Kaiser Permanente campus in Hacienda Business Park, July 2013 The city of Pleasanton initially chose not to preserve the transportation corridor within its city limits. Although the East Bay Regional Park District (EBRPD) still controlled the right of way, multiple developments were built encompassing the corridor, most notably Hacienda Business Park. The first work on the trail in Pleasanton began in March 2006, creating a new section about long on the south side of the city. This segment opened in March 2008. This left a gap in the trail, approximately long, extending from the Dublin side of the Dublin/Pleasanton BART station to Santa Rita Road near the Stoneridge Drive intersection, where the new segment begins. Beginning in June 2010, the EBRPD, City of Pleasanton, and landscape architects Callander Associates held public meetings to discuss options for completing the trail within the city. In February 2011, the Pleasanton City Council voted to ratify the EBRPD master plan developed based on these meetings. $4 million in regional and federal grants was allocated to complete this section of the trail. Construction began in May 2013, and the segment opened on July 25, 2014. The project accommodated several obstacles, including routing through an existing business campus, two city parks, a residential development, an apartment complex, and three at-grade crossings of busy roads; it connects with the earlier southern segment at the intersection of two major streets. In April 2013, a new trail segment opened along Stanley Boulevard on the north side of Shadow Cliffs Lake in unincorporated Alameda County. This leaves a gap between the end of the Pleasanton portion of the trail and the west end of this new segment, which ends at the Livermore city limits on the east end of the segment. The East Pleasanton Specific Plan Project includes plans to complete this gap along future extensions to Busch Road and El Charro Road to Stanley Boulevard.

It is located approximately northwest of the city of Summerside, and northwest of the city of Charlottetown.Government‚Äìsponsored \`MapGuide\` map of PEI. Retrieved on 28 March 2007. It has a population of 719. The name \\"Tignish\\" is derived from the Mi'kmaq \\"Mtagunich\\", meaning \\"paddle\\". Tignish was founded in the late 1790s by nine francophone Acadian families, with further immigrants (mostly Irish) arriving in the 19th century and settling mostly in the nearby smaller locality of Anglo‚ÄìTignish (meaning \\"English Tignish\\"). Many of Tignish residents today are either of Acadian or Irish heritage. One of the town's most popular and defining structures is the local Catholic church, St. Simon & St. Jude Catholic Church, which was among the first major structures built in Tignish, constructed between 1857 and 1860. Tignish was designated a community or village in 1952. It changed its status to a town in 2017.  Community  Famed landmark, St. Simon & St. Jude Church. Fishing is one of the most important aspects of daily life and employment in Tignish, with many local families depending on this industry for income. There are three functioning harbors located in the Tignish area: the Tignish harbour, the Skinner's Pond harbour, and the Seacow Pond harbour. Tignish was once the western terminus of the Prince Edward Island Railway. Rail service to the town was abandoned in 1989. Among the businesses in Tignish include the Tignish Heritage Inn, which was a convent from 1867 through 1991, Eugene's General Store, Judy's Take-out (until 2013), Shirley's restaurant, Tignish Co-op grocery store, hardware store, and gas station, Tignish Cultural Center, Cousin's Diner (until 2016), Pizza Shack (until 2012), and Perry's Construction. Citizens of Tignish celebrated the bicentennial of Tignish in 1999. Among local festivities were Acadian music, local parties, carnivals, and the creation of a local music CD rich with the voices of Tignish residents. In addition, each summer there is a bluegrass festival that is held in Tignish.  Accent and dialect Tignish has one of the most distinctive accents and original dialects in eastern Canada. Its sound is often described as a blend of French and Irish Gaelic, and there are many common English words that possess a unique alternate definition in Tignish, such as \\"slack\\", which locally, may mean \\"good\\" or \\"awesome\\". While English speakers in nearby towns such as Alberton and O'Leary have an accent and dialect similar to many other communities in the Maritime provinces, the Tignish dialect is often described independent from this dialect, and is sometimes not even comprehensible by non-locals.  Education  Kindergarten‚Äì12 students in the Tignish area mostly attend Tignish Elementary School from grades K‚Äì6, followed by Merritt E. Callaghan Intermediate and Westisle Composite High schools for grades 7‚Äì12.  Government  Tignish is within district #27 of PEI's electoral boundaries, which is labeled the Tignish‚ÄìPalmer Road division. There is a polling station at the Tignish fire hall, and others located elsewhere in Tignish as well as in St. Felix and Palmer Road. The name of the district used to be \\"Tignish‚ÄìDeBlois\\", but was changed to \\"Tignish‚ÄìPalmer Road\\" before the 2007 provincial election with slight boundary changes. As of the 2011 provincial election, Hal Perry is the MLA for the region. Perry left the PCs and joined the Liberals on 3 October 2013.

BNSF GP60B #346, a cabless hood unit A hood unit, in North American railroad terminology, is a body style for diesel and electric locomotives. On a hood unit, the body of the locomotive is less than full-width for most of the locomotive's length, with walkways on the outside of the locomotive. In contrast, a cab unit has a full-width carbody for the length of the locomotive. A hood unit has sufficient visibility to be operated in both directions from a single cab. Also, the underframe is the main load-bearing member, allowing the hood to be non-structural and easily opened or even removed for maintenance. History The hood unit evolved from the switcher locomotive. A switcher's long hood is normally low enough that the crew can see over it, and there typically is no short hood. Alco introduced the road switcher concept with the RS-1, which was an enlarged switcher with a short hood ahead of the cab. This was added to provide protection for the crew in case of a collision. The low long hood was retained, though its increased length made visibility over it useless. Later, EMD introduced the GP7, which had a similar layout, though both hoods were as high as the cab roof. The high long hood became standard for virtually all hood unit locomotives thereafter. The long hood of a locomotive is usually about as tall as the cab roof in order to fit the large prime mover and its related subsystems. Originally the short hood of the locomotive was the same height, which is referred to as a high-nose or, confusingly, high short hood. This was originally done to avoid union conflicts, as the high nose ensured that two crewmen (one on each side of the cab) were required in order to see both sides of the track. After this issue was resolved, the height of the short hood was reduced to increase visibility, creating a low-nose or low short hood locomotive. Some locomotives that were originally built with a high nose were later modified to have a low nose. Lately it has become common to make the short hood not only lower but also full-width, creating a wider nose which is usually referred to as a North American Safety Cab. The visibility and access advantages mean that the hood unit is overwhelmingly the most popular style of locomotive in North America, as well as many other regions. Operation Although the crew cabin is centered on some hood units (particularly in the case of dual, relatively small prime-movers), in most cases the cab is closer to one end of the locomotive than the other (in the case of a single, relatively large prime-mover), breaking the locomotive up into long hood and short hood sections. It is generally preferred to run a hood unit short hood forward so that the cab is closer to the front, but there is enough visibility in the other direction that they can run long hood forward at regular speeds. Some railroad companies (notably, the Norfolk & Western and the Southern) ordered locomotives with cabs facing long hood forward so that the short hood is actually the rear of the locomotives, but that practice has become increasingly rare. This was usually done to offer greater protection to the crew in the event of a collision. Other locomotives were set up with dual control stands so that they could operate in both directions, making it unnecessary to turn the locomotive around at the end of a run.

Lodewijk 'Louis' Bolk (December 10, 1866, Overschie - June 17, 1930, Amsterdam) was a Dutch anatomist who created the fetalization theory about the human body.

Furthermore, this \\"prematuration\\" is specifically human. Gavin de Beer and Stephen Jay Gould wrote about him and further developed this theory, which is sometimes called neoteny.

They are closely related with Coxeter groups. Examples are free groups, free abelian groups, braid groups, and right-angled Artin‚ÄìTits groups, among others. The groups are named after Emil Artin, due to his early work on braid groups in the 1920s to 1940s, and Jacques Tits who developed the theory of a more general class of groups in the 1960s.  Definition  An Artin‚ÄìTits presentation is a group presentation \\\\langle S \\\\mid R \\\\rangle where S is a (usually finite) set of generators and R is a set of Artin‚ÄìTits relations, namely relations of the form stst\\\\ldots = tsts\\\\ldots for distinct s, t in S, where both sides have equal lengths, and there exists at most one relation for each pair of distinct generators s, t. An Artin‚ÄìTits group is a group that admits an Artin‚ÄìTits presentation. Likewise, an Artin‚ÄìTits monoid is a monoid that, as a monoid, admits an Artin‚ÄìTits presentation. Alternatively, an Artin‚ÄìTits group can be specified by the set of generators S and, for every s, t in S, the natural number m_{s,t} \\\\geqslant 2 that is the length of the words stst\\\\ldots and tsts\\\\ldots such that stst\\\\ldots = tsts\\\\ldots is the relation connecting s and t, if any. By convention, one puts m_{s,t} = \\\\infty when there is no relation stst\\\\ldots = tsts\\\\ldots . Formally, if we define \\\\langle s, t \\\\rangle^m to denotes an alternating product of s and t of length m, beginning with s ‚Äî so that \\\\langle s, t \\\\rangle^2 = st, \\\\langle s, t \\\\rangle^3 = sts, etc. ‚Äî the Artin‚ÄìTits relations take the form : \\\\langle s, t \\\\rangle^{m_{s,t}} = \\\\langle t, s \\\\rangle^{m_{t, s}}, \\\\text{ where } m_{s, t} = m_{t, s} \\\\in \\\\\\\\{2,3,\\\\ldots, \\\\infty\\\\\\\\}. The integers m_{s, t} can be organized into a symmetric matrix, known as the Coxeter matrix of the group. If \\\\langle S \\\\mid R\\\\rangle is an Artin‚ÄìTits presentation of an Artin‚ÄìTits group A, the quotient of A obtained by adding the relation s^2 = 1 for each s of R is a Coxeter group. Conversely, if W is a Coxeter group presented by reflections and the relations s^2 = 1 are removed, the extension thus obtained is an Artin‚ÄìTits group. For instance, the Coxeter group associated with the n-strand braid group is the symmetric group of all permutations of \\\\\\\\{1, \\\\ldots, n\\\\\\\\}.  Examples  * G = \\\\langle S \\\\mid \\\\emptyset\\\\rangle is the free group based on S; here m_{s,t} = \\\\infty for all s, t. * G = \\\\langle S \\\\mid \\\\\\\\{st=ts \\\\mid s, t \\\\in S\\\\\\\\} \\\\rangle is the free abelian group based on S; here m_{s,t} = 2 for all s, t. * G = \\\\langle \\\\sigma_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\sigma_{n-1} \\\\mid \\\\sigma_i\\\\sigma_j\\\\sigma_i = \\\\sigma_j\\\\sigma_i\\\\sigma_j \\\\text{ for } \\\\vert i - j\\\\vert = 1, \\\\sigma_i \\\\sigma_j = \\\\sigma_j\\\\sigma_i \\\\text{ for } \\\\vert i - j\\\\vert \\\\geqslant 2 \\\\rangle is the braid group on n strands; here m_{\\\\sigma_i,\\\\sigma_j} = 3 for \\\\vert i - j\\\\vert = 1, and m_{\\\\sigma_i,\\\\sigma_j} = 2 for \\\\vert i - j\\\\vert > 1.  General properties  Artin‚ÄìTits monoids are eligible for Garside methods based on the investigation of their divisibility relations, and are well understood: * Artin‚ÄìTits monoids are cancellative, and they admit greatest common divisors and conditional least common multiples (a least common multiple exists whenever a common multiple does). * If A^+ is an Artin‚ÄìTits monoid, and if W is the associated Coxeter group, there is a (set-theoretic) section \\\\sigma of W into A^+, and every element of A^+ admits a distinguished decomposition as a sequence of elements in the image of \\\\sigma (\\"greedy normal form\\"). Very few results are known for general Artin‚ÄìTits groups. In particular, the following basic questions remain open in the general case: :‚Äì solving the word and conjugacy problems ‚Äî which are conjectured to be decidable, :‚Äì determining torsion ‚Äî which is conjectured to be trivial, :‚Äì determining the center ‚Äî which is conjectured to be trivial or monogenic in the case when the group is not a direct product (\\"irreducible case\\"), :‚Äì determining the cohomology ‚Äî in particular solving the K(\\\\pi, 1) conjecture, i.e., finding an acyclic complex whose fundamental group is the considered group. Partial results involving particular subfamilies are gathered below. Among the few known general results, one can mention: * Artin‚ÄìTits groups are infinite countable. * In an Artin‚ÄìTits group \\\\langle S \\\\mid R\\\\rangle, the only relation connecting the squares of the elements s, t of S is s^2t^2 = t^2s^2 if st = ts is in R (John Crisp and Luis Paris ). * For every Artin‚ÄìTits presentation \\\\langle S \\\\mid R\\\\rangle, the Artin‚ÄìTits monoid presented by \\\\langle S \\\\mid R\\\\rangle embeds in the Artin‚ÄìTits group presented by \\\\langle S \\\\mid R\\\\rangle (Paris). * Every (finitely generated) Artin‚ÄìTits monoid admits a finite Garside family (Matthew Dyer and Christophe Hohlweg). As a consequence, the existence of common right- multiples in Artin‚ÄìTits monoids is decidable, and reduction of multifractions is effective.  Particular classes of Artin‚ÄìTits groups  Several important classes of Artin groups can be defined in terms of the properties of the Coxeter matrix.  Artin‚ÄìTits groups of spherical type  * An Artin‚ÄìTits group is said to be of spherical type if the associated Coxeter group W is finite ‚Äî the alternative terminology \\"Artin‚ÄìTits group of finite type\\" is to be avoided, because of its ambiguity: a \\"finite type group\\" is just one that admits a finite generating set. Recall that a complete classification is known, the 'irreducible types' being labeled as the infinite series A_n, B_n, D_n, I_2(n) and six exceptional groups E_6, E_7, E_8, F_4, H_3, and H_4. * In the case of a spherical Artin‚ÄìTits group, the group is a group of fractions for the monoid, making the study much easier. Every above-mentioned problem is solved in the positive for spherical Artin‚ÄìTits groups: the word and conjugacy problems are decidable, their torsion is trivial, the center is monogenic in the irreducible case, and the cohomology is determined (Pierre Deligne, by geometrical methods, Egbert Brieskorn and Kyoji Saito, by combinatorial methods ). * A pure Artin‚ÄìTits group of spherical type can be realized as the fundamental group of the complement of a finite hyperplane arrangement in \\\\Complex^n. * Artin‚ÄìTits groups of spherical type are biautomatic groups (Ruth Charney). * In modern terminology, an Artin‚ÄìTits group A is a Garside group, meaning that A is a group of fractions for the associated monoid A^+ and there exists for each element of A a unique normal form that consists of a finite sequence of (copies of) elements of W and their inverses (\\"symmetric greedy normal form\\")  Right-angled Artin groups  * An Artin‚ÄìTits group is said to be right-angled if all coefficients of the Coxeter matrix are either 2 or \\\\infty, i.e., all relations are commutation relations st = ts. The names (free) partially commutative group, graph group, trace group, semifree group or even locally free group are also common. * For this class of Artin‚ÄìTits groups, a different labeling scheme is commonly used. Any graph \\\\Gamma on n vertices labeled 1, 2, \\\\ldots, n defines a matrix M, for which m_{s, t} = 2 if the vertices s and t are connected by an edge in \\\\Gamma, and m_{s, t} = \\\\infty otherwise. * The class of right-angled Artin‚ÄìTits groups includes the free groups of finite rank, corresponding to a graph with no edges, and the finitely-generated free abelian groups, corresponding to a complete graph. Every right-angled Artin group of rank r can be constructed as HNN extension of a right-angled Artin group of rank r - 1, with the free product and direct product as the extreme cases. A generalization of this construction is called a graph product of groups. A right-angled Artin group is a special case of this product, with every vertex/operand of the graph-product being a free group of rank one (the infinite cyclic group). * The word and conjugacy problems of a right-angled Artin‚ÄìTits group are decidable, the former in linear time, the group is torsion-free, and there is an explicit cellular finite K(\\\\pi, 1) (John Crisp, Eddy Godelle, and Bert Wiest). * Every right- angled Artin‚ÄìTits group acts freely and cocompactly on a finite-dimensional CAT(0) cube complex, its \\"Salvetti complex\\". As an application, one can use right-angled Artin groups and their Salvetti complexes to construct groups with given finiteness properties (Mladen Bestvina and Noel Brady ) see also (Ian Leary ).  Artin‚ÄìTits groups of large type  * An Artin‚ÄìTits group (and a Coxeter group) is said to be of large type if m_{s, t} \\\\geqslant 3 for all generators s eq t; it is said to be of extra-large type if m_{s, t} \\\\geqslant 4 for all generators s eq t. * Artin‚ÄìTits groups of extra-large type are eligible for small cancellation theory. As an application, Artin‚ÄìTits groups of extra-large type are torsion-free and have solvable conjugacy problem (Kenneth Appel and Paul Schupp). * Artin‚ÄìTits groups of extra-large type are biautomatic (David Peifer). * Artin groups of large type are shortlex automatic with regular geodesics (Derek Holt and Sarah Rees).  Other types  Many other families of Artin‚ÄìTits groups have been identified and investigated. Here we mention two of them. * An Artin‚ÄìTits group \\\\langle S \\\\mid R \\\\rangle is said to be of FC type (\\"flag complex\\") if, for every subset S' of S such that m_{s, t} eq \\\\infty for all s, t in S', the group \\\\langle S' \\\\mid R \\\\cap S'{}^2 \\\\rangle is of spherical type. Such groups act cocompactly on a CAT(0) cubical complex, and, as a consequence, one can find a rational normal form for their elements and deduce a solution to the word problem (Joe Altobelli and Charney ). An alternative normal form is provided by multifraction reduction, which gives a unique expression by an irreducible multifraction directly extending the expression by an irreducible fraction in the spherical case (Dehornoy). * An Artin‚ÄìTits group is said to be of affine type if the associated Coxeter group is affine. They correspond to the extended Dynkin diagrams of the four infinite families \\\\widetilde{A}_n for n \\\\geqslant 1, \\\\widetilde{B}_n, \\\\widetilde{C}_n for n \\\\geqslant 2, and \\\\widetilde{D}_n for n \\\\geqslant 3, and of the five sporadic types \\\\widetilde{E}_6, \\\\widetilde{E}_7, \\\\widetilde{E}_8, \\\\widetilde{F}_4, et \\\\widetilde{G}_2. Affine Artin‚ÄìTits groups are of Euclidean type: the associated Coxeter group acts geometrically on a Euclidean space. As a consequence, their center is trivial, and their word problem is decidable (Jon McCammond and Robert Sulway ). Very recently, a proof of the K(\\\\pi, 1) conjecture was announced for all affine Artin‚ÄìTits groups (Mario Salvetti and Giovanni Paolini).

Biography Of the family of the Lindsays of the Byres, a grandson of Patrick Lindsay, 4th Lord Lindsay, Robert was born at Pitscottie, in the parish of Ceres, Fife, which he held in lease at a later period. His Historie, the only work by which he is remembered, is described as a continuation of that of Hector Boece, translated by John Bellenden. Although it sometimes degenerates into a mere chronicle of short entries, it is not without passages of great picturesqueness. Sir Walter Scott made use of it in his narrative poem Marmion; and, in spite of its inaccuracy in details, it is useful for the social history of the period. Lindesay's share in the Historie was generally supposed to end with 1565; but Dr Aeneas Mackay considers that the frank account of the events connected with Mary, Queen of Scots, between 1565 and 1575 contained in one of the manuscripts is by his hand and was only suppressed because it was too faithful in its record of contemporary affairs. The Historie was first published in 1728. A complete edition of the text, based on the Laing MS. No. 218 in the university of Edinburgh, was published by the Scottish Text Society in 1899 under the editorship of Aeneas Mackay. The manuscript, formerly in the possession of John Scott of Halkshill, is fuller, and, though in a later hand, is, on the whole, a better representative of Lindsay's text. According to the Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Scotsmen: :As to the Chronicles themselves, it is not perhaps very easy to determine in what language they should be spoken of. They present a strange compound of endless and aimless garrulity, simplicity, credulity, and graphic delineation; the latter, however, evidently the effect not of art or design, but of a total want of them. He describes events with all the circumstantiality of an eyewitness, and with all the prolixity of one who is determined to leave nothing untold, however trifling it may be. :But his credulity, in particular, seems to have been boundless, and is remarkable even for the credulous age in which he lived. He appears to have believed, without question, every thing which was told him; and, believing it, has carefully recorded it. After detailing at some length, and with great gravity, all the circumstances of the mysterious summons of Plotcock, previous to the battle of Flodden, \\"Verily,\\" he says, \\"the author of this, that caused me write the manner of the summons, was a landed gentleman, who was at that time twenty years of age, and was in the town the time of the said summons; and thereafter, when the field was stricken, he swore to me, there was no man that escaped that was called in this summons, but that one man alone which made his protestation.\\" :The earnest and honest simplicity of the good old chronicler, however, is exceedingly amusing. He aims at nothing beyond a mere record of what he conceived to be facts, and these he goes on detailing, with a great deal of incoherence, and all the unintellectual precision, of an artificial process, neither feeling, passion, nor mind ever appearing to mingle in the slightest degree with his labours. These characteristics of the chronicles of Lindsay have greatly impaired their credibility, and have almost destroyed all confidence in them as authorities.

It is notable as one of very few online TV shows to make the leap onto broadcast TV as the show videoGaiden, which has had four series shown on BBC Scotland. The name Consolevania is a reference to Konami's long-running horror-adventure game series Castlevania and was chosen by Rllmuk forum membersEpisode 1 Commentary before the first episode was shot. Fittingly, the first game reviewed on the show was Castlevania: Lament of Innocence. The first episode was filmed in the summer of 2004 and initially distributed on CDs posted out by the team. Eventually all episodes became distributed online via the BitTorrent peer-to-peer network, although an archive of http first and second series downloads now existsIndex of /consolevania and lower quality http downloads are released concurrently with the more recent BitTorrent releases. On January 23, 2017, it was announced via Patreon that a new series of consolevania was planned for production. The first episode of the new run was released on February 18, 2017, and the show is following a regular monthly release schedule. History Consolevania was first released online in 2004, presented by Robert Florence, former writer for BBC comedy Chewin' the Fat, and Ryan Macleod. Primary coverage was of console games; however, since the donation of a PC by sponsor Alienware at the start of Series Two, PC games have also been reviewed. Much of the audience for the early episodes came from various online discussion forums, in particular Rllmuk (itself seen by many as the spiritual home of Consolevania) and NTSC-UK. The show gradually gained a substantial internet following, largely by word of mouth, and began to attract the attention of both mainstream and video gaming media. Following the description of the show by Sky News as having \\"something that almost every other games show ever created has lacked: true passion for the subject matter,\\" GP Forums - Etqw Beta 2!! the BBC expressed interest in the show, reportedly since it garners \\"more viewers than some shows they produce already.\\".Boomtown - PC The show received widespread underground popularity and is now a global entity. BBC Scotland commissioned a games review show from First Person Shooters in a similar vein to Consolevania, titled videoGaiden. This was broadcast on BBC Two Scotland from November to December 2005 for six weeks. In April 2006, it was reported that Consolevania had acquired the movie rights to the Jeff Minter computer game Hover Bovver.Consolevania gets movie rights News - Page 1 // None /// Eurogamer - Games Reviews, News and More Though they had claimed that the adaptation would be released at some point in 2007, there have been no further updates since. With no statements issued by Minter about the status of the arrangement, it is presumed that the movie did not get any further than pre-production, or even enter it. New episodes of Consolevania were released online on an irregular basis, and, in response to much critical acclaim, a second run of videoGaiden, featuring lengthier episodes, was commissioned by BBC Scotland and aired in late 2006. The third series however, has hugely focused on internet-only episodes of which 18 were made and released over a six-month period. The only material that was made specifically for broadcast were just three \\"TV Specials\\". The decision to focus so heavily on internet output seems to be in line with a soapbox piece from the second series. In this segment, Robert Florence stated that television is a dying medium and that the BBC needed to accept this and embrace internet programming, an area they currently do not understand. On October 10, 2008, Series 4 premiered on Consolevania.com, alongside a newly redesigned website. Series 4 was presented in a new way, with separate segments being uploaded frequently to YouTube. These segments were also used in new \\"high quality digest\\" episodes of compiled and exclusive content.Consolevania Series 4 page Format and style The show primarily consists of a mixture of video game-related comedy sketches, reviews of both newly released and older video games, and occasional preview features highlighting forthcoming titles, especially those that appear unusual or eccentric. The lighthearted comedic approach of the show is met with clear passion for video games and knowledge of the medium's history. The program has sometimes experimented with unusual visual effects, such as flash edits and periods of slow-motion. Much of the humour is referential, expressing knowledge of a variety of video games of both mainstream popularity and relative obscurity. This ability to mock the video game industry whilst remaining affectionate toward it is typical of Consolevania's style. Where previous video game TV shows such as Bits and Thumb Bandits claimed irreverence with their use of swear words but still were forced to operate within the established systems of television production, Florence and Macleod are able to dictate the content of their own show without the need for censorship to avoid offence. Examples of content likely to be restricted on United Kingdom television are the inclusion of characters such as Adolf Hitler and John Wayne Gacy, although these characters are for the most part mocked in the show as opposed to praised in any way. The fact that the show is self- produced by Florence and Macleod's own production company has presented some issues of budget. In the first series, the equipment was mostly rented, and as such the release of the shows were very irregular. An upshoot of this lack of budget was the microphone used by the team, an omnidirectional device attached to a bent wire coathanger covered in red duct tape. It was frequently thrown at whichever character or presenter was on camera at the start of each sketch or review. However, there was no sign of the microphone at the start of the second series and the show's creators claim it was buried after a night of drunken revelry. Eventually, during the show's 'Independents Day' episode, it was unearthed and so may find itself in service once again. Some of the show's other recurring themes and sketches include: *The team engaging in various physical activities whilst shouting \\"tap tap tap\\" (in reference to 'button bashing' athletics games such as Track and Field). *The misadventures of Adolf Hitler and his bizarre cohort El Zomba (see below), the former apparently interested in taking over the show for his own nefarious purposes, the latter being his sometime assistant and possibly lover. *John Gacy's \\"Kiddies' Corner\\", where the notorious serial killer reviews video games aimed at children. *Impromptu interviews with members of the public about games, conducted by one of the show's most popular characters, an American known only as Legend (see below). *Video game cosplay, with an emphasis on the ridiculous. *Overblood, a video game the team display a passionate distaste for. Perhaps also an issue of budget, there was some inconsistency in the lengths of early episodes, varying runtimes between 45 minutes to an hour. However, the show's creators claim they have now found a format they are happy with and consequently later episodes have been just over 30 minutes in length. At the start of the second series, a basic awards system has been introduced, where the team awarded gold, blue, or brown ribbons to video games that they consider exceptional (gold), very good (blue), or particularly poor (brown). However, as the next episode abandoned this system for one based on Jeff Minter using a torch, it is likely that the new ratings system was never intended to be taken seriously. Video game industry satire Consolevania often satirizes major industry figures and companies, both with impersonating caricatures (such as Lionhead Studios developer Peter Molyneux) and the manipulation of press conference videos for humor (Reggie Fils-Aime of Nintendo of America and Sony's Ken Kutaragi, among many others). Microsoft's J Allard is also frequently satirized. In a QuizVania segment in Episode 2.3 , Allard is listed 2nd in the list of \\"10 Things that are an Embarrassment to the Games Industry\\". During this suggestion, the message \\"Act your fucking age\\" is flashed on screen. In Episode 2.1, Consolevania presented a video game proposal to Rockstar Games for a \\"next-generation\\" title, Manpuncher vs. Boxhead. This consisted of a video short resembling a '70s police drama starring a gruff anti-authority figure who punches children and fights villains who all conveniently use the same 3D model to cut production costs. Rockstar politely rejected the proposal. In recent episodes, the Consolevania team have issued taunting challenges for a street fight to Codemasters and Rare. On 13 September 2007, Consolevania made a major splash with an incisive satirical parody of a Halo 3 promotional advertisement. The parody addressed an under-discussed issue with Xbox Live online gaming‚Äîthe bad behaviour of a large proportion of the subscribers.

Hoffs - Plays the role of Hitler and Peter Molyneux, though Michael has not been featured since the second episode of the second series. *Ryan Macleod - The second main reviewer, as Mr. Ryan. He also plays Sammy Miller. *Kenny Swanston - Introduced into the show in the third episode (though playing an unnamed, masked wrestler in the firstEpisode 1 Commentary), Kenny is seen repeatedly antagonising and bullying Mr. Robert and Mr. Ryan, both of whom are intimidated by his presence. He berates them for their incompetence and forever telling others that he will \\"show them how it's fucking done\\". Their fear seems justified, as Kenny's particularly violent lessons tend to involve a thorough beating or, at their very worst, liberal use of Force lightning. At the end of Series 2, Kenny left the Consolevania TEAM to become the leader of the Dreamcast Universe, however, he returned in the first episode of Series 3 for reasons as yet unknown. *Joanne Daly is a series regular and also appeared in each episode of the BBC sister show videoGaiden. She is also responsible for Consolevania.com's current design. *Louise Stewart has been featured in a variety of supporting roles, along with Louise's young sister Courtney Stewart, who vexes Gacy. *Allan Miller joins the cast in series three as the paranoid 'Ziggy Springsteen', a representative of the sponsors. *Limmy, first seen in series 3 as overconfident 'Zack Eastwood', he also was in many episodes of videoGaiden series 3. *Richard Rankin, introduced in the reviews section of the Consolevania website, makes his debut in the show in the second episode of the third series‚Äîappearing in a starring role in \\"Ken Loach's Halo\\". Many members of the cast work behind the camera as crew, either directing, filming or later editing the show. Recurring characters *Legend - A brash American who claims to be the Xbox Live World Champion, having defeated Lisasimpson45 in both Mech Assault and Halo 2 deathmatch. The main street interviewer in the show, he hails from Milwaukee in Wisconsin, and wears a Russian ushanka. An interview with Rab and Ryan in GamesTM Magazine in February 2007 suggested that Legend is unlikely to return in Series Three due to the fact that the team are unkeen on 'comedy that takes the piss out of unwitting members of the public'. *John Gacy - Based upon the serial killer John Wayne Gacy, this is one of the more controversial characters. A clown dressed in top hat and black coat, he presents the \\"children's\\" section of the show. Most of the humour in his segments consists of Freudian slips inadvertently revealing that he's a paedophilic serial killer, or reading out \\"fan\\" letters which contain pleas for help before quickly correcting himself. *Hitler - Constantly frustrated and depressed following his defeat in World War II, Hitler's segments are vitriolic diatribes about his dissatisfaction and struggles with video games and the internet. He was about to commit suicide during the show's Christmas Special, but reconsidered after he was visited by a Guardian Angel claiming to be Patrick Moore. When Moore showed Hitler how fantastic the world would be if he had never existed (in reference to It's a Wonderful Life) he gained a new sense of purpose in life, and headed off to make the world miserable and make Consolevania his own. *El Zomba - Hitler's cohort and life partner (Hitler once despairs that he/she is once again pregnant) and an ogre-like character (Mr. Robert, wearing only a Mexican wrestling mask and tape around the groin). He is incompetent in the extreme. *Sammy Miller - Consolevania's safety advisor, commenting upon gaming safety and the potential side-effects of video games, many of which subsequently befall him. *Shigsy - The presenter of \\"The Shigsy Show\\", he is a lecherous sock puppet. As his nickname may suggest, he is supposed to represent Nintendo's game designer and artist, Shigeru Miyamoto.

The tomb was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1993, and since then has undergone extensive restoration work, which is complete. Besides the main tomb enclosure of Humayun, several smaller monuments dot the pathway leading up to it, from the main entrance in the West, including one that even pre-dates the main tomb itself, by twenty years; it is the tomb complex of Isa Khan Niyazi, an Afghan noble in Sher Shah Suri's court of the Suri dynasty, who fought against the Mughals, constructed in 1547 CE. The complex encompasses the main tomb of the Emperor Humayun, which houses the graves of Empress Bega Begum, Hamida Begum, and also Dara Shikoh, great-great-grandson of Humayun and son of the later Emperor Shah Jahan, as well as numerous other subsequent Mughals, including Emperor Jahandar Shah, Farrukhsiyar, Rafi Ul-Darjat, Rafi Ud-Daulat, Muhammad Kam Bakhsh and Alamgir II.Mausoleum of Humayun, Delhi British Library. It represented a leap in Mughal architecture, and together with its accomplished Charbagh garden, typical of Persian gardens, but never seen before in India, it set a precedent for subsequent Mughal architecture.

The site was chosen on the banks of Yamuna river, due to its proximity to Nizamuddin Dargah, the mausoleum of the celebrated Sufi saint of Delhi, Nizamuddin Auliya, who was much revered by the rulers of Delhi, and whose residence, Chilla Nizamuddin Auliya lies just north-east of the tomb. In later Mughal history, the last Mughal Emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar took refuge here, during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, along with three princes, and was captured by Captain Hodson before being exiled to Rangoon.Humayun's Tomb Archaeological Survey of India. At the time of the Slave Dynasty this land was under the 'KiloKheri Fort' which was capital of Sultan Kequbad, son of Nasiruddin (1268‚Äì1287).

Thereafter it was taken to Sirhind, in Punjab by Khanjar Beg and, in 1558, it was seen by Humayun's son, the then Mughal Emperor, Akbar. Akbar subsequently visited the tomb in 1571, when it was about to be completed.Humayun's Tomb Muqarnas: An Annual on Islamic Art and Architecture, by Oleg Grabar.

The tomb of Humayun was built by the orders of his first wife and chief consort, Empress Bega Begum (also known as Haji Begum). Construction began in 1565 and was completed in 1572; it cost 1.5 million rupees, paid entirely by the Empress. Bega Begum had been so grieved over her husband's death that she had thenceforth dedicated her life to a sole purpose: the construction of a memorial to him than would be the most magnificent mausoleum in the Empire, at a site near the Yamuna River in Delhi. According to Ain-i-Akbari, a 16th- century detailed document written during the reign of Akbar, Bega Begum supervised the construction of the tomb after returning from Mecca and undertaking the Hajj pilgrimage.Haji Begum Ain-i-Akbari. \\"He (Qa¬¥sim 'Ali¬¥ Khan) was employed to settle the affairs of H√°j√≠ Begum, daughter of the brother of Hum√°y√∫n's mother (tagh√°√≠ z√°dah i w√°lidah i Jannat-√°st√°n√≠), who after her return from Makkah had been put in charge of Hum√°y√∫n's tomb in Dihl√≠, where she died.\\" According to Abd al-Qadir Bada'uni, one of the few contemporary historians to mention construction of the tomb, it was designed by the Persian architect Mirak Mirza Ghiyas (also referred to as Mirak Ghiyathuddin), who was selected by the Empress and brought from Herat (northwest Afghanistan); he had previously designed several buildings in Herat, Bukhara (now Uzbekistan), and others elsewhere in India. Ghiyas died before the structure was completed and it was completed by his son, Sayyed Muhammad ibn Mirak Ghiyathuddin. An English merchant, William Finch, who visited the tomb in 1611, describes rich interior furnishing of the central chamber (in comparison to the sparse look today). He mentions the presence of rich carpets, as well as a shamiana, a small tent above the cenotaph, which was covered with a pure white sheet, and with copies of the Quran in front along with Humayun's sword, turban and shoes. The fortunes of the once famous Charbagh (Four-gardens) made of four squares separated by four promenades, radiating from a central reflection pool. It spread over 13 hectares surrounding the monument, changed repeatedly over the years after its construction. The capital had already shifted to Agra in 1556, and the decline of the Mughals accelerated the decay of the monument and its features, as the expensive upkeep of the garden proved impossible. By the early 18th century, the once lush gardens were replaced by vegetable garden of people who had settled within the walled area. However, the capture of the last Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 together with the premises, and his subsequent sentencing to exile, along with execution of his three sons, meant that the monument's worst days lay ahead, as the British took over Delhi completely. In 1860, the Mughal design of the garden was replanted to a more English garden-style, with circular beds replacing the fours central water pools on the axial pathways and trees profusely planted in flowerbeds. This fault was corrected in the early 20th century, when on Viceroy Lord Curzon's orders the original gardens were restored in a major restoration project between 1903‚Äì1909, which also included lining the plaster channels with sandstone; a 1915 planting scheme added emphasis to the central and diagonal axis by lining it with trees, though some trees were also planted on the platform originally reserved for tents.A Tomb Brought to Life by Ratish Nanda Historic Gardens Review Number 13. London: The Historic Gardens Foundation, 2003. In 1882, the official curator of ancient monuments in India published his first report, which mentioned that the main garden was let out to various cultivators; amongst them till late were the royal descendants, who grew cabbage and tobacco in it. During the Partition of India, in August 1947 the Purana Qila together with Humayun's Tomb, became major refugee camps for Muslims migrating to the newly founded Pakistan, and was later managed by the government of India. These camps stayed open for about five years, and caused considerable damage not only to the extensive gardens, but also to the water channels and the principal structures. Eventually, to avoid vandalism, the cenotaphs within the mausoleum were encased in brick. In the coming years, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), took on responsibility for the preservation of heritage monuments in India, and gradually the building and its gardens were restored. Until 1985, four unsuccessful attempts were made to reinstate the original water features. An important phase in the restoration of the complex began around 1993, when the monument was declared a World Heritage Site. This brought new interest to its restoration, and a detailed research and excavation process began under the aegis of the Aga Khan Trust and the ASI. This culminated in 2003, when much of the complex and gardens were restored, with the historic fountains running once again after several centuries of disuse. The restoration has been a continuous process ever since, with subsequent phases addressing various aspects and monuments of the complex. Architecture Floor plan of tomb structure of Humayun's Tomb Humayun's cenotaph Ceiling of entrance chamber inside Turkish and Mughal rule in the Indian subcontinent, also introduced Central Asian and Persian styles of Islamic architecture in the region, and by the late 12th century early monuments in this style were appearing in and around Delhi, the capital of Delhi Sultanate. Starting with the Turkic Slave dynasty which built the Qutb Minar (1192 AD) and its adjacent Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque (1193 CE). North India was successively ruled by foreign dynasties in the coming centuries giving rise to the Indo-Islamic architecture. While the prevailing style of architecture was trabeate, employing pillars, beams and lintels, this brought in the arcuate style of construction, with its arches and beams, which flourished under Mughal patronage and by incorporating elements of Indian architecture, especially Rajasthani architecture including decorative corbel brackets, balconies, pendentive decorations and indeed kiosks or chhatris, to develop a distinct Mughal architecture style, which was to become a lasting legacy of the Mughal rule. The combination of red sandstone and white marble was previously seen in Delhi Sultanate period tombs and mosques, most distinctively in the highly decorative Alai Darwaza gatehouse in the Qutub complex, Mehrauli, built in 1311 AD, under the Khalji dynasty. Humayun's Tomb Garden Enclosure Plan The high rubble built enclosure is entered through two lofty double-storeyed gateways on the west and south, 16 metres high with rooms on either side of the passage and small courtyards on the upper floors. The tomb built of rubble masonry and red sandstone, uses white marble as a cladding material and also for the flooring, lattice screens (jaalis), door frames, eaves (chhajja) and for the main dome. It stands on a vaulted terrace eight-metre high and spread over 12,000m¬≤. It is essentially square in design, though chamferred on the edges to appear octagonal, to prepare ground for the design of the interior structure. The plinth made with rubble core has fifty- six cells all around, and houses over 100 gravestones. Plus, the entire base structure is on a raised platform, a few steps high. Inspired by Persian architecture; the tomb reaches a height of and the plinth is wide, and was the first Indian building to use the Persian double dome on a high neck drum, and measures , and is topped by high brass finial ending in a crescent, common in Timurid tombs. The double or 'double-layered' dome, has its outer layer which supports the white marble exterior, while the inner part gives shape to the cavernous interior volume. As a contrast to the pure white exterior dome, rest of the building is made up of red sandstone, with white and black marble and yellow sandstone detailing, to relieve the monotony. The symmetrical and simple designed on the exterior is in sharp contrast with the complex interior floor plan, of inner chambers, which is a square 'ninefold plan', where eight two-storied vaulted chambers radiate from the central, double-height domed chamber. It can be entered through an imposing entrance iwan (high arc) on the south, which is slightly recessed, while others sides are covered with intricate jaalis, stone latticework. Underneath this white dome in a domed chamber (hujra), lies the central octagonal sepulcher, the burial chamber containing a single cenotaph, that of the second Mughal Emperor, Humayun aligned on the north‚Äìsouth axis, as per Islamic tradition, wherein the head is placed to the north, while the face is turned sideways towards Mecca. The real burial chamber of the Emperor, however, lies further away in an underground chamber, exactly beneath the upper cenotaph, accessible through a separate passage outside the main structure, which remains mostly closed to visiting public. This burial technique along with pietra dura, a marble and even stone inlay ornamentation in numerous geometrical and arabesque patterns, seen all around the facade is an important legacy of the Indo-Islamic architecture, and flourished in many later mausolea of the Mughal Empire, like the Taj Mahal, where again we find twin cenotaphs and exquisite 'pietra dura' craftsmanship.World Heritage Sites - Humayun's Tomb: Characteristics of Indo- Islamic architecture Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). The main chamber also carries the symbolic element, a mihrab design over the central marble lattice or jaali, facing Mecca in the West, here instead of the traditional Surah 24, An-Noor of Quran which is inscribed on the mihrabs, this one is just an outline allowing light to enter directly into the chamber, from Qibla or the direction of Mecca, thus elevating the status of the Emperor, above his rivals and closer to divinity. This chamber with high ceiling is then encompassed by four main octagonal chambers on two floors, set at the diagonals with arched lobbies leading to them also connecting them, plus there are four auxiliary chambers in between suggesting that the tomb was built as a dynastic mausoleum. Collectively the concept of eight side chambers not only offers passage for circumambulation of the main cenotaph, a practice common in Sufism and also visible in many Mughal imperial mausoleums, it also reflects the concept of Paradise in Islamic cosmology. Each of the main chambers has, in turn, eight more, smaller chambers radiating from them, and thus the symmetrical ground plan reveals itself to contain 124 vaulted chambers in all. Many smaller chambers too, contain cenotaphs of other members of the Mughal royal family and nobility, all within main walls of the tomb. Prominent among them cenotaphs of Hamida Begum herself are there alongside Dara Shikoh. In all there are over 100 graves within the entire complex, including many on the first level terrace, earning it the name \\"Dormitory of the Mughals\\", since the graves are not inscribed their identification remains uncertain. The building was first to use its unique combination of red sandstone and white marble, and includes several elements of Indian architectural, like the small canopies, or chhatris surrounding the central dome, popular in Rajasthani architecture and which were originally covered with blue tiles.Delhi - Humayun's Tomb and Adjacent Building Delhi Through Ages, by S. R. Bakshi. Published by Anmol Publications PVT. LTD., 1995. . Page 29-35.Humayun's Tomb Washington University. Char Bagh While the main tomb took over eight years to build, it was also placed in centre of a Char Bagh (Four Gardens), a Persian-style garden with quadrilateral layout and was the first of its kind in the South Asia region in such a scale. The highly geometrical and enclosed Paradise garden is divided into four squares by paved walkways (khiyabans) and two bisecting central water channels, reflecting the four rivers that flow in jannat, the Islamic concept of paradise. Each of the four square is further divided into smaller squares with pathways, creating into 36 squares in all, a design typical of later Mughal gardens. The central water channels appear to be disappearing beneath the tomb structure and reappearing on the other side in a straight line, suggesting the Quranic verse, which talks of rivers flowing beneath the 'Garden of Paradise'.Mughul Tomb GardensThe poetics of gardens, by Charles Willard Moore, William J. Mitchell. Published by MIT Press, 2000. . Page 17. The entire tomb and the garden is enclosed within high rubble walls on three sides, the fourth side was meant to be the river Yamuna, which has since shifted course away from the structure. The central walkways, terminate at two gates: a main one in the southern wall, and a smaller one in the western wall. It has two double-storey entrances, the West gate which used now, while the South gate, which was used during Mughal era, now remains closed. Aligned at the centre on the eastern wall lies a baradari, literally a pavilion with twelve doors, which is a building or room with twelve doors designed to allow the free draught of air through it, finally on the northern wall lies a hammam, a bath chamber. Other monuments Isa Khan Niyazi's Tomb, dating 1547 Tomb and mosque of Isa Khan: Several monuments dot the pathway leading up to the tomb enclosure from the main entrance in the West. Prominent among them is one that pre-dates the main tomb itself, by twenty years. Constructed in 1547 CE, it is the tomb complex of Isa Khan Niyazi, an Afghan noble in Sher Shah Suri's court of the Suri dynasty, who fought against the Mughals. The octagonal tomb is positioned within an octagonal garden, which was built during his own lifetime and the reign of Islam Shah Suri, son of Sher Shah. It later served as a burial place for the entire family of Isa Khan. On the western side of the tomb lies a three-bay wide mosque, in red sandstone. The octagonal tomb bears a striking resemblance to other tombs of the Sur dynasty monuments in the Lodhi Gardens, in Delhi and demonstrates a marked progression in the development of the exquisite architectural style of the main tomb. Some of the architectural details present here were seen later in the main Humayun's tomb, though on a much grander scale, such as the tomb being placed in a walled garden enclosure.Isa Khan Niyazi Tomb Complex archnet.org. Bu Halima's Garden and tomb view Bu Halima's Tomb and Garden: When entering the complex from the West, visitor's first enter a garden complex, known as Bu Halima's Garden, though little is known about her, and since the tomb or the raised platform where it once stood is not at the centre, it appears to be a later addition. Afsarwala Tomb and mosque: Standing southwest end of the complex, lies the Afsarwala tomb, dedicated to an unknown person. One of the marble graves inside the tomb is dated 1566-67 CE. The mosque itself can be dated to the same period judging from its siting, standing as it does adjacent to the tomb, rather than away from it. Arab Serai: Literally meaning the sarai (resthouse) for the horses, the structure stands adjacent to the Afsarwala mosque and was built by Bega Begum around 1560-1561 CE, ostensibly built for the craftsmen who came for the construction work. It could accommodate 300 Arabas.(in Persian ÿßÿ±ÿßÿ®Ÿá means:Cart or Gari (vehicle)). Nila Gumbad ca 1625/6, built by courtier Abdul Rahim Khan-I-Khana, for his servant Fahim Khan Nila Gumbad: Standing outside the boundary of the complex is the tomb known as Nila Burj (now known as Nila Gumbad) or 'Blue Dome', so called because it carries striking blue glazed tiles. It was built by Abdul Rahim Khan-I-Khana, son of Bairam Khan also a courtier in Mughal Emperor, Akbar's court, for his servant Miyan Fahim. Fahim, who not only grew up with his son, but later also died alongside one of Rahim's own sons, Feroze Khan, while fighting against the rebellion of Mughal general Mahabat Khan in 1625/26, during the reign of Jahangir.Miyan Fahim Ain-i-Akbari. This structure is known for its unique architecture, as it is octagonal on the outside while square within; its ceiling is decorated with painted and incised plaster, it has a high neck dome and shows a conspicuous absence of a double dome feature, common to tombs of the period. Chillah Nizamuddin Aulia: Believed to be the residence of patron saint of Delhi, Nizamuddin Auliya (d. 1325 A.D), is located just outside the main complex, near the northeastern corner of the principal mausoleum and is an example of Tughlaq period architecture. Yet further away from the tomb complex, lie Mughal-period monuments, Bada Bateshewala Mahal, the tomb of Muzaffar Husain Mirza, the grand nephew of Humayun, built 1603‚Äì4 on platform with five arches on each side, has its interior walls decorated with incised and painted plaster; the Chote Bateshewala Mahal once an arcaded octagonal building with a domed ceiling and stone jaalis. Both these monument now lie inside a commercial area facing the complex's parking lot. Another period structure is Barapula, a bridge with 12 piers and 11 arched openings, built in 1621 by Mihr Banu Agha, the chief eunuch of Jahangir's court. Barber's Tomb: Towards the south-east corner, within the Char Bagh, lies a tomb known as Nai-ka-Gumbad, or Barber's Tomb, belonging to royal barber, it is datable to 1590-91 CE, through an inscription found inside. Its proximity to the main tomb and the fact that it is the only other structure within the main tomb complex suggests its importance, however, there are no inscriptions suggesting as to who is interred therein, the name Barbers tomb is the local name of the structure, hence still in use.World Heritage Sites - Humayun's Tomb: Tomb Complex Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). retrieved-31 May 2010. The tomb stands on a raised platform, reached by seven steps from the south, it has a square plan and consists of a single compartment covered with a double-dome. Inside lie two graves each inscribed with verses from the Quran. Also, one of the graves is inscribed with figure 999 which may stand for the Hijra year 1590‚Äì91. However, in an 1820 watercolour now at British Library, the Persian caption beneath the structure reads, Maqbarah-i-Kokah i.e. \\"Tomb of Kaka\\", and Kokah or Kaka in Persian stand for foster-brother (mirak brother), Mirak(a Persian title as sir) though the identity of the person remains unknown, and it might be (incorrectly) referring to another nearby monument in the Chausath Khamba complex, the tomb Ataga Khan, the foster brother of Humayun, which lies in Nizamuddin West area and not to the east of the Humayun's tomb.Mausoleum of Humayun, Delhi British LibraryKoka Koka A Comprehensive Persian-English Dictionary.Old images of Chausath Khamba Columbia University Restoration Restoration work at Humayun's tomb, required removal of 3000 truckloads (12,000 cubic meters) of earth, and special chute installed at the back, from the roof (2008) Before the restoration work was undertaken, vandalism and illegal encroachments were rampant at the site of the tomb, presenting a serious danger to the preservation of this invaluable treasure. At the main entrance of Humayun's Tomb, dingy stalls had been put up under a very corrupt system of municipal patronage known as tehbazari, and all sorts of heavy vehicles were allowed to be parked illegally in these open spaces. On the Nila Gumbad side was a huge citadel of India's vote bank politics ‚Äî thousands of ‚Äòslum dwellers‚Äô were kept by an influential section of the political leadership to serve as ‚Äòbonded voters‚Äô during elections. The environment of the dargah of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya had also been ruthlessly degraded and the holy tank had become a messy cesspool. Restoration work by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC), in collaboration with Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), began around 1999 after research work, which started in 1997, and was completed in March 2003. Around 12 hectares of lawns were replanted, and over 2500 trees and plants, including mango, lemon, neem, hibiscus and jasmine cuttings, were planted in the gardens. Installation of a new water circulation system for the walkway channels was also undertaken. To ensure that water flowed naturally through the channels and pools on the 12-hectare (30 acre) site without the aid of hydraulic systems, the water channels were re-laid to an exacting grade of one centimetre every 40 metres (1:4000 slope). This eventually enabled water to flow through the watercourses in the gardens, and dormant fountains to start functioning once again. Other tasks in this mammoth restoration project included setting up a rainwater harvesting system using 128 ground water recharge pits, and desilting and revitalising old wells that were discovered during the restoration work.Plaque about the Experimental development at Humayun's Tomb, Delhi, 2000-2003..Revitalisation of the Humayun's Tomb Gardens - AKTC Aga Khan Trust for Culture website. This was first a privately funded collaborative effort under the aegis of the National Cultural Fund (NCF) by the ASI. Funding included a sum of $650,000 from the Aga Khan Trust for Culture of His Highness the Aga Khan, with help from the Oberoi Hotels Group....Aga Khan Trust for Culture and help from the Oberoi Hotels Group The Hindu, 29 January 2004Trust's research on Humayun's Tomb over, project to begin Indian Express, 18 November 1999.Humayun Tomb Gardens Revitalisation, 2000s Archnet.org.A Mughal Splendor Regained By Celia W. Dugger. New York Times, 29 September 2002. In addition, AKTC is conducting a more significant restoration at Babur's tomb, the resting place of Humayun's father in Kabul. After the restoration work, the conditions in and around this complex underwent a sea-change. All the stalls and other intrusions were removed and the monuments and green spaces restored. Elegant gardens now surround the monuments, adding to their dignity and grace. When illuminated at night, the monument looks truly magnificent. In 2009, as a part of the ongoing restoration work, the ASI and AKTC, after months of manual work using hand- tools, removed from the roof a thick layer of cement concrete that had been exerting pressure of about 1,102 tons on the structure. The cement concrete was originally laid in the 1920s to prevent water seepage, and led to a blockage in water passages. Subsequently, each time there was leakage, a fresh layer of cement was added, leading to an accumulated thickness of about 40 cm; this has now been replaced with a traditional lime-based roof layer. In the next phase, similar treatment was given to the tomb's first chabutra (plinth), which was originally paved with large blocks of quartzite stone, some weighing over a 1,000 kg. In the 1940s, an uneven settlement in the lower plinth had been corrected by covering it with a layer of concrete, adding to the disfigurement of the original Mughal flooring, which matched with that at the West Gate. The tomb in literature Letitia Elizabeth Landon published a poetical illustration reflecting on the scene in The Tomb of Humaioon, Delhi, based on an engraving showing a somewhat distant view of the tomb. The mausoleum today Ill thought out construction plans like The Delhi Government's plans in 2006/2007 to build a new tunnel to connect East Delhi to Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Delhi in South Delhi, and to widen the roads near the tomb for the 2010 Commonwealth Games to connect National Highway-24 with Lodhi Road, also posed a serious threat to the monument. Urban planners feared that the historic monument would not have been able to withstand the vibrations ensuing from the construction work in such close proximity. Finally, the Archaeological Survey of India was able to halt the plans. On 30 May 2014, the finial of the tomb was knocked off the dome by a heavy storm which struck the city. On 19 April 2016, India's Union Culture Minister Dr. Mahesh Sharma unveiled the restored finial of the monument. The original finial will be conserved.

It was released on the GameCube, PlayStation 2 and Xbox consoles in 2004. Barking Lizards Technologies developed the N-Gage port of the game, which was released in early 2005. Players can play as one of fifteen X-Men characters, with the ability to switch between four computer- or human-controlled characters at any time. X-Men Legends follows Alison Crestmere, a young mutant who has the ability to summon and control volcanic activity. As Alison is taught to control her powers at the X-Mansion, the X-Men are sent on several missions. Eventually the X-Men learn of Magneto's plan to cover the Earth in darkness from his base on Asteroid M. X-Men Legends received generally positive reviews from critics. The Xbox version was the best received, garnering aggregate scores of 83% and 82/100 on the review aggregating websites GameRankings and Metacritic respectively. Reviewers praised Raven's variation on cel-shaded graphics. Due to the success of the game a sequel was made, X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse. Gameplay X-Men Legends awards players for using their mutant powers against an enemy simultaneously, known as a combo. This concept would later evolve into \\"Fusions\\" in alt=In each corner of the screen a playable character's head appears, along with a red and blue bar extending horizontally back towards the center of the screen. At the bottom center five large circular \\"X\\" logos are seen, with three being brighter. To the left center are two glowing orbs with numbers representing their availability. In the center a beam is being fired at an off screen enemy, while another character advances towards a large robot. X-Men Legends is an action role-playing game. Players choose a team of up to four characters from a larger group of X-Men. As players proceed through the game, additional X-Men are unlocked. On the console versions, up to four players can play in the cooperative campaign, with the ability to add or remove players at any time. Cooperative play features a refined combat system and the ability to interact with non-player characters. The game also features a skirmish mode, which allows players to fight against each other or against waves of computer-controlled enemies. As characters gain experience points, players can upgrade their four main powers and other abilities unique to that character. Items found during gameplay can also be equipped to further enhance a character's abilities. Characters can combine attacks to create a combo, in which two or more players use their mutant powers on a single enemy at the same time. The characters' special abilities can be used to create a \\"Super Combo\\" when combined with an \\"Xtreme Power\\" which become available at level 15. The X-Mansion serves as a hub that the team returns to after each mission. While at the mansion, one player controls Alison Crestmere as she explores and learns about herself and the other X-Men. Here players can also view loading screen art, cinematics, and comic book covers acquired during gameplay. Biographies of the X-Men and their enemies can be accessed on computers located in the mansion. Players can participate in an X-Men trivia game, which rewards experience points for correct answers. Additionally, players can access the Danger Room's computer to play challenge missions unlocked during gameplay. The players have two vendors available to them: Forge, who sells equipment and the Morlock Healer, who provides health and energy packs as well as training disks for use in the Danger Room. Forge becomes available after Alison contacts him accidentally from the X-Mansion, and Healer can be accessed following the third mission. The N-Gage version of X-Men Legends contains most of the features found on the console versions. However, the game is played from an isometric point of view. Characters are two-dimensional sprites based on their three-dimensional console counterparts, and levels are redesigned to meet the limitations of the isometric point of view. Cutscenes were reused from the console versions, but are rendered at a much lower frame rate. Players can link with other N-Gage systems for four-player cooperative gameplay using GSM cellular technology. Plot X-Men Legends is not set in any particular Marvel Comics universe. It is played from the perspective of a teenage girl named Alison Crestmere, a mutant with the ability to control volcanic activity. At the start of the game, Alison is abducted by the Genetic Research and Security Organization (GRSO). Alison: Somebody help me! I'm not a mutant! I swear I'm not! As GRSO soldiers take her away, Mystique arrives with Blob and takes Alison from the soldiers. Mystique: Blob, grab the girl and get out of here! She is in turn rescued from Mystique and Blob by the X-Men Wolverine and Cyclops, who take her to the Xavier Institute to explore her powers. Jean Grey: Good work, guys. Now get Alison to the X-Jet. I'll meet you there. As Alison trains, the X-Men investigate an Alaskan research facility being attacked by the Brotherhood of Mutants, then rescue Gambit from the Morlocks. Player Character: We'll have you out of there in a second, Gambit Gambit: No worries. Ol' Gambit done already picked the lock. They then try to stop the Brotherhood from rescuing Magneto from captivity aboard the U.S.S. Arbiter. Mystique is able to penetrate the defenses and free Magneto, and the ensuing damage caused by the Brotherhood leaves the X-Men to rescue several Arbiter crew members. Player Character: We have to save the Arbiter crew! Jean, can you use your telekinetic powers to hold the ship together? With Alison's training complete, she takes the codename Magma Alison: Do I get a cool code name? Wolverine: How about Pebbles? ... Alison: Mmm, those are good suggestions but I had a name in mind already. How about Magma? and the X-Men travel to Russia to help Colossus prevent the Brotherhood from obtaining weapons-grade plutonium. Colossus: Because of Magneto's attack the reactor is close to critical mass. If I drop this regulator there will be a nuclear explosion. After accomplishing this mission, they discover that Colossus's sister, Illyana, is in a coma from a psychic hold placed on her by the Shadow King. Professor Xavier, Emma Frost, and Jean Grey enter the astral plane to save her. They succeed, but in the process Xavier is captured by the Shadow King. Professor Xavier: What do you intend to do now? Shadow King: I should have thought it obvious, Xavier. I will have my revenge. After Xavier's capture, the X-Men learn that General William Kincaid, a leader in the anti- mutant movement, is building mutant-hunting Sentinels. Magneto travels to his base on Asteroid M, where he reveals his plan to cover the Earth in darkness. Meanwhile, the X-Men free Xavier, who defeats the Shadow King in a psychic battle. Shadow King: What!? You've escaped? No matter. Now you will die, Xavier. The X-Men travel to Asteroid M, where they discover that the asteroid is on a collision course with Earth. After defeating Magneto, they search for the Gravitron, a device used to pilot the asteroid. They encounter General Kincaid, who pilots Master Mold, a larger and more powerful prototype Sentinel. After defeating General Kincaid, the X-Men locate the Gravitron, and Magma uses her powers to steer the asteroid back into space. Wolverine: Kid, the Gravitron was built for Magneto. It could kill ya. Magma: That's a chance I'll have to take. The X-Men's victory on Asteroid M is watched by Apocalypse, who makes his upcoming plot from his base. Apocalypse : Enjoy your small victory, Xavier. For the Age of Apocalypse is nigh! In the game's epilogue, a television news anchor reports that Magneto is still at large and General Kincaid has been arrested for crimes against humanity. The game ends with the President of the United States thanking the X-Men for their service. Development X-Men Legends was announced in a press release by Activision on April 23, 2003. The game is Raven Software's first console title; after a number of successful titles for personal computers, it wanted to expand into the console market. The company developed the three console versions simultaneously, and used Vicarious Visions' Alchemy engine as a base for the game. After deciding to make an \\"X-Men RPG\\", staff began brainstorming story, gameplay and design ideas. Raven wanted to feature a team-based dynamic, something it felt was absent in previous X-Men games. The original concept featured turned-based gameplay, similar to a Final Fantasy game. However, the team concluded that players would prefer more action that allowed control of the character's super powers. The genre switch proved problematic to maintaining the team aspect of gameplay. The group experimented with several gameplay models, and opted for one that allowed players to freely switch characters. The final product mimics isometric dungeon crawling video games. Raven designed gameplay with strategy in mind; each character's abilities allow different interactions with the environment and other characters. For example, a physically strong character like Colossus can break walls but is unable to reach certain areas that require the ability to fly, and Iceman is able to freeze enemies so that other characters can easily defeat them. Staff hoped that the differences would force players to switch characters regularly during missions. Extraction points, specific locations that players can switch characters, were added to allow players to continue without a game over in the event one or more team member was defeated. Raven included flash back missions as an homage to the franchise and based some on specific comic book issues. Originally a single-player game, Raven eventually incorporated simultaneous co-orperative gameplay. The developers chose to not create an online multi- player mode, stating that the gameplay was \\"designed around localized encounters\\". Patrick Stewart provided the voice acting for Professor X, a role that he also portrayed in the X-Men films. The game's story was penned by a group of former Marvel writers known as Man of Action, consisting of Duncan Rouleau, Joe Casey, Joe Kelly, and Steven T. Seagle, with Stan Lee consulting. Man of Action chose the character Magma as their lead because she was an \\"appropriately blank slate as a character\\". Man of Action also stated that the script for X-Men Legends was in excess of five hundred pages. The writers created a story that would allow for players to change their active team throughout the game and not affect the overall flow of the story. The game's voice cast consists largely of television and film stars as well as veteran voice actors. Patrick Stewart reprised his role as Professor Xavier from the X-Men films, while Tony Jay voiced Magneto. Ed Asner lent his voice as Healer, a Morlock shaman. Lou Diamond Phillips voiced Forge, a Native American mutant whose power grants him intuitive talent for inventing mechanical devices. Danica McKellar voiced Jubilee, a young mutant who generates plasmoids from her fingertips. Veteran voice actors Steven Blum, Grey DeLisle, Dee Bradley Baker, Robin Atkin Downes and Dorian Harewood also lent voices as Wolverine, Mystique, Nightcrawler, Cyclops and Shadow King, respectively. Music for the game was composed by Rik Schaffer of the Los Angeles-based Womb Music. Characters were selected from different time lines in the X-Men universe. Art lead Brian Pelletier said that they took the most memorable characters from the last 40 years and grouped them together. X-Men Legends uses cel shading to give the characters a comic-like appearance. However, Raven cited that they opted for then-high resolution textures to stay away from \\"cartoony looking\\" characters. The process was accomplished by creating a second copy of the model, inverting the normals, then increasing the size of the model slightly. Character costumes were inspired by Marvel Comics' Ultimate X-Men, but some of the X-Men playable in X-Men Legends had not appeared in the comics at the time of its release so, with permission from Marvel, Raven created unique looks for those characters. During development Raven tried visual formats for the X-Men, including using their New X-Men uniforms as well as removing the cel-shaded look from the characters. In contrast, the back stories, relationships and personalities of the X-Men were taken from Marvel's mainstream universe. Angel was also to be included in the game, and was to be voiced by Andr√© Sogliuzzo, but was cut from the final build. Reception X-Men Legends received mostly positive reviews, with the Xbox version receiving the highest aggregate scores of 83.36% at GameRankings and 82/100 at Metacritic. The GameCube version was rated next highest, scoring 81.98% at GameRankings and 81/100 at Metacritic. Though the PlayStation 2 version received the lowest scores of the console versions, it still fared well, scoring 80.50% at GameRankings and 79/100 at Metacritic. The N-Gage version garnered scores similar to its console counterparts, receiving 76.13% and 79/100 at GameRankings and Metacritic, respectively. In 2011, GamePro retrospectively listed \\"the melee combat, ability to customize your stats, and multiplayer\\" among the strong points of X-Men Legends, adding that the game \\"was so successful that it created a well- received sequel and paved the way for the Marvel Ultimate Alliance series\\". Critics generally praised the game's use of cel-shading. IGN's Hilary Goldstein stated, \\"to capture the 'comic book feel', Raven Soft chose to go for a cel-shaded look with Legends. It's not that the characters look two- dimensional, but they have very basic textures and a cut-out look\\". GameSpot reviewer Jeff Gerstmann pointed out that though the characters are cel-shaded, the environments are not, making them easy to distinguish. The gameplay was lauded for its role-playing elements, character powers and melee combat. Eurogamer praised the Xbox version's control system for character powers and melee attacks, as well as the \\"fluid\\" combat. Reviewers found that the artificial intelligence (AI) was lacking, and recommended the game's multiplayer. Opinions were generally mixed on the subject of voice acting. X-Play reviewer Russ Fischer called it \\"purely average\\", though he made an exception for Patrick Stewart's portrayal of Professor Xavier. IGN noted that while some voice acting fit the characters well, others seemed out of place. The N-Gage version was praised for the ability to play cooperatively using the N-Gage's bluetooth technology. Reviewers also found that the game's graphics were \\"very strong\\" and that \\"everything looks amazing\\". The presence of voice acting in the N-Gage port was also praised, with GameSpy reviewer Justin Leeper stating the audio clips seemed to be \\"lifted right out of other versions\\". He criticized the AI, however, for being \\"[a] bit stupid at inopportune times\\" and for failing to use the game's healing abilities at important moments. Sequel and similar games X-Men Legends sold enough copies to be inducted into the budget lines for all three consoles on which it was released: PlayStation 2's Greatest Hits, GameCube's Player's Choice, and Xbox's Platinum Hits. By July 2006, the PlayStation 2 version of X-Men Legends had sold 800,000 copies and earned $28 million in the United States. Next Generation ranked it as the 74th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. Combined sales of the Legends series reached 2 million units in the United States by July 2006. A sequel, X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse was released for all major platforms in the fall of 2005, and the N-Gage later that year. Barking Lizards again helped port the game, this time to mobile phone devices. Vicarious Visions ported the game to the PlayStation Portable (PSP), and Beenox developed the PC port. The success of the X-Men Legends series led Raven Software, Marvel, and Activision to create the video game Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, which was released on several consoles, handheld devices and the PC in 2007. Barking Lizards, Vicarious Visions and Beenox handled the ports for different platforms. Marvel: Ultimate Alliance was followed by Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2, jointly developed by Vicarious Visions, n-Space and Savage Entertainment. Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 was released on several consoles and handhelds in the fall of 2009. Vicarious Visions developed the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions, while n-Space developed the Nintendo DS, PSP and Wii versions. Savage Entertainment ported the version developed by n-Space to the PSP.

This list may not include all states containing an introduced population of rudd. Invasive species Rudd were illegally introduced into New Zealand in the 1960s and have been actively spread around the country. They have the potential to irreversibly damage indigenous ecosystems. Rudd were reported in the United States at least as early as 1925. It is unlawful to possess or transport live specimens in the US state of Tennessee.page 11 http://www.tn.gov/twra/pdfs/fishguide.pdf No person, firm, corporation, partnership nor association shall possess, sell, offer for sale, import, bring, release or cause to be brought or imported into the State of Alabama any species of fish ‚Äúrudd‚Äù (Scardinius erythrophthalmus) or ‚Äúroach‚Äù (Rutilus rutilus) nor any hybrids of either species.page 63 http://www.outdooralabama.com/sites/default/files/2014-15%20Complete%20Reg%20Book%20LE% This species was reported in Alabama from First Creek in Lauderdale County, Alabama, ca. 1987. Identification Large rudd in a natural setting Morphologically, this species is very similar to the roach (Rutilus rutilus), with which it can be easily confused. It can be identified by the yellow eye colour. The eye of the roach has a big red spot above the pupil, that can be more or less conspicuous. The rudd has an upturned mouth allowing it to feed easily at the top of the water. The placement of the dorsal fin is more to the rear which is even visible in very young fish. There are normally only one or two scales between the tip of the pelvic fins and the anal fins, while on the roach there are five. Also the skin of the rudd is yellowish green, while the roach is bluish on the flanks. Also the upturned mouth is visible even in young fish. Furthermore, the rudd's number of soft rays in the dorsal fin (8‚Äì9 compared to 10‚Äì12). There can be confusion with the ide also, which has smaller scales however. There is a variety of the common rudd, popular among pond-keepers, known as the golden rudd, which has a gold-coloured body. The rudd can grow to a size of about 45‚Äì50 cm with an average of about 25 cm. The dorsal fin and pectoral fins are greyish with a reddish tint and all the other fins are bright red. This coloring of the fins is the feature to which the seventeenth century name ‚Äòrudd‚Äô refers. Ecology Rudd prefer clear waters rich in plants. They also feed on aquatic vegetation when the temperature exceeds 18 ¬∞C. They hunt for living prey in the upper levels. They prefer mesotrophic waters, while the roach is sometimes found together with the perch in waters that are nutrient poor. Rudd appear to prefer non-acidic water.http://www.fishbase.org/summary/Scardinius-erythrophthalmus.html It prefers shallow weedy areas in lakes and river backwaters, where mature females lay up to 200,000 eggs on submerged vegetation. Young rudd eat zooplankton, aquatic insects, and occasionally other small fish. Mature rudd, which are about 18‚Äù in length and weigh about 3 pounds, eat mostly aquatic vegetation. The rudd can consume up to 40% of their body weight in vegetation per day, as much as 80% of which is discharged as waste, releasing nutrients into the water column. They can tolerate a wide range of temperatures and water conditions, including eutrophic or polluted waters. In the laboratory rudd readily hybridize with the U.S. golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoleucas). They come in both silver and gold, and are sometimes sold as pond ornamentals. Maximum lifespan has been reported as 17 years. Sexual maturity has been reported at 2‚Äì3 years.http://txstate.fishesoftexas.org/scardinius%20erythrophthalmus.htm ReferencesFurther reading External links *Rudd at the Department of Conservation (New Zealand) Scardinius Cyprinid fish of Europe Fish described in 1758 common rudd ","title":"Common rudd"},{"id":"1355766","text":"Meadowhall Interchange is a transport interchange located in north-east Sheffield, consisting of a combined heavy rail station, tram stop and bus and coach station. The second-busiest heavy rail station in the city in terms of passenger numbers, Meadowhall Interchange provides connections between National Rail services, the Sheffield Supertram light rail network, intercity coach services and the city bus network. The interchange was opened in 1990 by British Rail under the Regional Railways sector, to serve the new Meadowhall shopping centre, which opened at the same time and is connected to the interchange by a pedestrian footbridge. The interchange is now owned by Network Rail and operated by Northern, with additional services provided by TransPennine Express. History=Previous stations The first station to be named after the Meadowhall area, Meadowhall and Wincobank, was opened in 1868 by the South Yorkshire Railway on the Blackburn Valley Line from Sheffield Victoria to Barnsley. Meadowhall and Wincobank station closed in 1953 and the track was eventually lifted and converted into a cycle path in 1987, although the station building survives in good condition. Upon opening in 1990, Meadowhall Interchange effectively replaced Brightside station, located around one mile further down the line towards Sheffield. However, limited services continued to serve Brightside for several years after the opening of Meadowhall Interchange, with Brightside station finally closing in 1995. Construction and opening Supertram platforms in 2004 Meadowhall Interchange was constructed to serve the new Meadowhall shopping centre, which opened on 4 September 1990 on the site of abandoned steelworks in the Don Valley in north-east Sheffield. The interchange was constructed to the north of the shopping centre on the opposite bank of the River Don, with a pedestrian suspension bridge linking the interchange with the shopping centre. The heavy rail and bus and coach stations opened in 1990. The Sheffield Supertram light rail platforms opened on 21 March 1994. The section of line from Meadowhall to Fitzalan Square, in the city centre, was the first phase of the network to open. Future Meadowhall Interchange was selected as the initial site for Sheffield's High Speed 2 station, with a high-level viaduct station planned to be constructed parallel to the M1 motorway's Tinsley Viaduct adjacent to the mainline station.\\"Meadowhall to get Sheffield's HS2 high-speed rail station\\"BBC News 28 January 2013https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/69019/hs2-arp- lr0-dr-rt-55151_3-0.pdf However, these plans were eventually dropped, with plans for High Speed 2 services to instead serve Sheffield station in the city centre.\\"HS2: Sheffield and South Yorkshire Report 2016 (Research & Analysis)\\"High Speed 2 Ltd 7 July 2016; Retrieved 19 July 2016\\"HS2 South Yorkshire route change threatens new estate\\"BBC News Sheffield & South Yorkshire news article 7 July 2016; Retrieved 19 July 2016 As part of the plans for High Speed 2, proposals were put forward for the construction of a new Supertram line from Meadowhall Interchange to Dore & Totley station in the south-west of the city.\\"New Sheffield Supertram line in ‚Äòtransport revolution‚Äô\\"The Star news article 28 January 2013 Layout and facilities=Layout Platforms 1 and 2 The interchange is located to the north of Meadowhall shopping centre, to which it is connected by a pedestrian footbridge, which provides the main entrance to the interchange. Additionally, entrances are located from Meadowhall Road into the bus station, on Barrow Road from the park and ride car park onto the heavy rail platforms, and from Tyler Street directly from street level onto the main concourse. The ticket office for National Rail services is located off to the side of the footbridge which connects the interchange with the shopping centre. This footbridge continues over platforms 1 and 2, opening up onto an raised open-air concourse area from which platforms 2 and 3 can be accessed. A further footbridge from this central concourse provides access to platform 4 and the Tyler Street interchange entrance; platform 1 and the Supertram platforms are accessed directly by steps down from the main footbridge, opposite the ticket office. Platforms 3 and 4 There are no ticket barriers at the interchange. In addition to the ticket office, several ticket machines are located in the open-air concourse between platforms 2 and 3. The main waiting room, with toilet and baby changing facilities, is located at the end of the light rail platforms, opening onto platform 1, with an additional waiting room provided on platform 2. A park and ride car park is located behind platform 2, with additional parking facilities available around the shopping centre. A second concourse is located next to the bus and coach station and contains toilets, Travel South Yorkshire ticket purchasing facilities and a number of small shopping outlets. Platforms The station is located immediately to the north-east of Station Junction, where the Dearne Valley Line diverges from the Hallam and Penistone Lines. Platforms 1 and 2 are a pair of side platforms located closest to the shopping centre on the Dearne Valley Line. Platforms 3 and 4 are a pair of side platforms located on the other side of the central open-air concourse on the Hallam and Penistone Lines, laid out at a 45 degree angle to platforms 1 and 2. Supertram platforms in 2018 The light rail platforms, numbered MEI1 and MEI2, are located immediately behind and parallel to platform 1; they are constructed in an island layout. Since the cessation of off-peak Purple Line services to Meadowhall Interchange, most tram services depart from platform MEI1. There are a total of sixteen stands at the bus and coach station, arranged into four main rows, each accessed by zebra crossings. Row A, consisting of stands A1 to A5, is located alongside the bus station concourse. Row B, consisting of stands B1 and B2, is located as a small island between rows A and C. Row C, consisting of stands C1 to C5, and row D, consisting of stands D1 to D4, are a pair of parallel island rows located at the side of the bus station closest to the heavy rail platforms. The majority of intercity bus and coach services depart from row A, while city bus services depart from rows B, C and D.

Current off-peak tram services from the interchange consist of five Yellow route trams per hour to Middlewood, via the city centre. Additional services operate during the morning and evening peak to provide a ten minute frequency. Bus and coach services Bus and coach interchange Meadowhall bus and coach station is located a short distance from Junction 34 of the M1 motorway, meaning it is more conveniently located for intercity coach services than Sheffield Interchange in the city centre. As a result, many coach services for Sheffield call at Meadowhall Interchange instead of the city centre. To link passengers with Sheffield city centre, there are many bus services between Sheffield Interchange and Meadowhall Interchange, including the express X1 and X78 every ten minutes. Intercity coach services, operated by Megabus and National Express, usually depart from stands A1 and A2, the two stands closest to the shopping centre. Coach service destinations include London, Leeds, Newcastle, Scotland and various airports. Meadowhall Interchange is also a major hub for intercity, local and city bus services operated by First South Yorkshire, Powells Bus, Stagecoach Yorkshire and TM Travel, including express routes X1 and X78 to Maltby and Doncaster respectively. The bus station is in the PlusBus scheme, which means that train and bus tickets can be bought together at a saving. Meadowhall is in the same zone as Sheffield station.

Along with Herbert Lom and Burt Kwouk, he has appeared in more Pink Panther films than any other actor, playing a variety of characters, including reprising Lajoy in Trail of the Pink Panther (1982) and twice playing Dr Auguste Balls (in Revenge of the Pink Panther, 1978; and Son of the Pink Panther, 1993). His most memorable role was playing the hotel clerk in the \\"Does your dog bite\\" scene in The Pink Panther Strikes Again. Stark, as well as Lom and Kwouk, have each appeared in seven titles from the series‚Äî remarkable given that Peter Sellers, who originated the franchise‚Äôs central Inspector Clouseau character, appeared only in six entries (counting 1982‚Äôs Trail of the Pink Panther, which used only outtakes and previously released footage of the late Sellers). Stark gave a moving performance in the film Alfie (1966) as Humphrey, a timid bus conductor who takes on a woman (Julia Foster) and her child when the title character (played by Michael Caine) refuses commitment. He also played the role of Lord Fortnum's doctor, Captain Pontius Kak, in the original stage play of The Bed-Sitting Room, which opened at the Mermaid Theatre on 31 January 1963.Milligan, Spike, & Antrobus, John (1973) The Bedsitting Room. Tandem: London. First published in Great Britain by Margaret & Jack Hobbs, 1970. Published by Universal-Tandem, 1972. (C) 1970 Spike Milligan and John Antrobus p.158. McCann cites the doctor's name as Captain Martin. This is possible. There appears to have been variation in names used, certainly between the play and the film, and possibly during the life of the play. Following the death of James Beck, Stark took over the role of Private Joe Walker in the radio adaptation of Dad's Army. In 1982, Stark appeared in a cameo role as a butler, alongside Dandy Nichols, in the music video for Adam Ant's UK No. 1 hit \\"Goody Two Shoes\\". He played the character of Mr Nadget in the 1994 BBC adaptation of Martin Chuzzlewit.  Personal life  In 1959 he married Audrey Nicholson, who survives him with their two sons and a daughter. Stark was also an accomplished stills photographer. He was the last known performer to have appeared on The Goon Show during its original run. In 2003 he published an autobiography, Stark Naked. He died in London on 29 October 2013 at age 91, after suffering a stroke..

These locomotives are operated by Pacific National in Australia. A cab unit and a carbody unit are body styles of locomotives in North American railroad terminology. While closely related, they are not exactly the same. A carbody unit may be either a cabless booster unit controlled from a linked cab unit, or a cab unit that contains its own controls. With both body styles, a bridge-truss design framework is used to make the body a structural element of the locomotive. The body extends the full width and length of the locomotive. The service walkways are inside the body. Carbody units, gaining rigidity from the body trusswork, require less structural weight to achieve rigidity than do locomotives with non-structural bodies. For that reason, carbody construction was favored to increase the power-to-weight ratio for early diesel locomotives, before the power available with diesel technology was increased. Recent years have seen carbody construction revived in the quest for greater fuel efficiency with passenger locomotives. The full-width body gives a carbody cab unit poor rear visibility compared with a hood unit. For that reason, cab or carbody units are mostly used in situations where rear visibility is not important, such as power for through freight and passenger trains. Cab and carbody units are also more aerodynamic than hood units, and pulled many of the streamliner trains. A and B unit A cab unit is a carbody unit with a driving cab, or crew compartment. Thus, a cab unit is also always an A unit (a locomotive with a cab). By contrast, a carbody unit can be either an A unit, or a B unit (a locomotive without a cab).

Despite some visual similarities, cowl units are actually very different from cab units. All structural support on a cowl unit is provided by the frame of the locomotive, rather than in the body as with a cab unit. This allows manufacturers to cheaply and easily create full-width locomotives from their hood unit designs by simply adding cowling. Cowl units were first introduced as a special order from the Santa Fe, which wanted a sleeker design for its passenger equipped hood units. Although the first cowl units (such as the EMD FP45 and the GE U30CG) were meant for passenger service, EMD would later offer freight-only derivatives starting with the F45. Great Britain Cab units were not generally used in Great Britain. The traditional makers continued to use heavyweight frames and cowl units instead. Most British diesel locomotives, e.g. the British Rail Class 37, are cab units but the term \\"cab unit\\" is not used in Britain. The Class 37, like most British diesel and electric locomotives, has a cab at each end.

The railway had a number of world firsts: it was the first electric elevated railway, the first to use automatic signalling, electric colour light signals and electric multiple units,Liverpool Overhead Railway The Transport Trust and was home to one of the first passenger escalators at a railway station. It was the second oldest electric metro in the world, being preceded by the 1890 City and South London Railway. Originally spanning five miles from Alexandra Dock to Herculaneum Dock, the railway was extended at both ends over the years of operation, as far south as Dingle and north to Seaforth & Litherland. A number of stations opened and closed during the railway's operation owing to relative popularity and damage, including air bombing during World War II. At its peak almost 20 million people used the railway every year. Being a local railway, it was not nationalised in 1948. In 1955, a report into the structure of the many viaducts showed major repairs were needed that the company could not afford. The railway closed at the end of 1956 and despite public protests the structures were dismantled in the following year. Since 1977, Liverpool's rapid transit/commuter rail needs have been served by the partly underground Merseyrail network, which was formed from local suburban lines and uses no former infrastructure of the Liverpool Overhead Railway. History=Toponymy The overhead refers to the railway being primarily constructed above street level, and not to overhead line, though there is no ambiguity as the electrical supply was third rail. When the LOR was extended to the Dingle terminus the overhead description of the railway would have seemed an anomaly to those descending to the platform there which was underground in a tunnel. At least two alternative names for the railway existed: Dockers‚Äô Umbrella; and ovee, a local slang term. Origins and construction Illustration of a section of the railway As a result of the traffic, congestion, and overcrowding of the dock roads, many proposals were made for transport solutions. Rails were laid at Liverpool Docks in 1852, linking the warehouses and docks. Initially horses were used, as locomotives were banned because of the risk of fire. From 1859, passenger services were provided using adapted horse omnibuses; the wheel flanges could be retracted to allow an omnibus to leave the tracks to overtake a goods train. By the 1880s, there was an omnibus service every five minutes. An elevated railway was first proposed in 1852, and in 1878 the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board (MD&HB;) obtained powers for a single-line steam railway with passing loops at stations. The MD&HB; applied to the Board of Trade based on this plan, but it was rejected and there was no further progress. The Liverpool Overhead Railway Company was formed in 1888 and obtained permission to build a double-track railway in the same year. Engineers Sir Douglas Fox and James Henry Greathead were commissioned to design the railway. Steam traction was considered and they considered fitting floors to the structure to prevent ash falling to the street below, however this was seen as a fire risk. Sir William Forwood, the Chairman of the Liverpool Overhead Railway, had studied American electric railways, and in 1891 electric traction was chosen. John William Willans was chosen as the primary contractor. Building started in 1889 and was completed in January 1893. The structure was to be made of wrought iron girders a nominal above the roadway. A total of 567 spans were erected, most being long. The standard gauge railway was laid on longitudinal timbers on the elevated sections. Four bridges were constructed to cross wider streets. Hydraulic lifting sections were provided at Brunswick, Sandon and Langton Docks to allow goods access to the docks. To allow shipping access to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, at Stanley Dock a bridge was replaced by a combined lifting and swing bridge, the lower lifting section carrying the road and goods railway. At Bramley-Moore Dock, the railway dropped to road level to pass under the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR;) coal tip branch. As the gradient was 1 in 40 this was known as the switchback. Originally the conductor rail was placed between the rails, energised at 500‚Äì525 volts DC. The power was supplied by a generating station at Bramley-Moore Dock that received its coal directly from the Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway branch line which passed above. Special lightweight passenger cars were designed with each having a driving motor car; one bogie was powered with a single motor. They were placed on the track in the switchback section. The finished railway ran between Alexandra Dock and Herculaneum Dock, though the line extended another half a mile north of Alexandra Dock station to the carriage sheds and workshops; no land closer to the station had been available. At the time of opening in February 1893, the railway had cost ¬£510,000 and used a total of 25,000 tons of iron and steel. Opening A cap badge from the railway The first official journey on the railway took place on 7 January 1893, with the railway Chairman taking engineers and other people of importance on a tour of the length of the railway. The railway was officially opened on 4 February the same year by the Leader of the Opposition the Marquis of Salisbury, who turned on the main electrical current during a ceremony at the generating station at the Bramley- Moore Dock. The ceremony was attended by the Earl of Lathom, Lord Kelvin, the Mayor of Liverpool, the chairman of the Dock Board, directors and engineers, and a number of other guests, who traveled on an inaugural journey along the railway. The public services started on 6 March, with the first carriages leaving from the Alexandra Dock and Herculaneum Dock stations at 7am. The Liverpool Echo reported that \\"the carriages appear to be fairly well filled with passengers.\\" In the early days of the railway there were a number of injuries and at least one fatality as a result of passengers and conductors overestimating the height of the railway while standing up on the top deck of open top buses. Realising that the railway was receiving low traffic outside of working hours, the line was extended northwards to Seaforth Sands on 30 April 1894 in order to reach more residential areas. The extension brought the total length of the railway to 6 miles and cost a total of ¬£10,000. While the passengers had previously been primarily travelling to businesses and the city, the Seaforth extension resulted in a large increase in traffic from residents of the outer areas of Liverpool. An extension southwards from Herculaneum Dock to Dingle was opened on 21 December 1896. Dingle was the only underground station, the extension from Herculaneum Dock being achieved with a lattice girder bridge and a half-mile () tunnel through the sandstone cliff to Park Road.  Operation  The railway's contractor, J.W. Willans was appointed as its Chief Engineer. He specialised in building and running electric railways, and in 1902, newer and more powerful electric motors were fitted to the trains in order to reduce service times in order to keep up with the competition from trams. In the early 20th century, the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway L&YR; was electrifying its routes out of . A connection was built from the L&YR; station to a new station beside Seaforth Sands. The railway became popular with tourists. A 1902 Liverpool guidebook devoted a whole chapter to viewing and visiting the docks via the overhead railway, and a 1930s poster described it as \\"the best way to see the finest docks in the world\\". As of 1919, a total of 18 million passengers used the Overhead Railway each year,14 million passengers per year, even during WWII, and 9 million into the 1950s. From 1902, the journey end-to-end journey time was reduced to 22 minutes, but due to increased power and maintenance costs, the trains were then slowed down by 6 minutes in 1908, and the frequency of trains was increased to one every 3 minutes during peak times. By 1910, the operating hours were unrivaled, providing at least one train every 10 minutes from 4:45 am until 11:33 pm on weekdays. From 2 July 1905, Overhead Railway trains began running through to Seaforth & Litherland, and through connections and through bookings between Liverpool Overhead Railway stations and the Southport branch of the Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway were made available, with revised fares and timetables. The L&YR; built some special lightweight electric stock and from 1906 began running services from Dingle to and Aintree. Regular services to Aintree were withdrawn in 1908, and after this special trains ran only twice a year, on Jump Sunday and the following Friday for the Grand National, both held at Aintree Racecourse. Through services from Dingle to Southport were withdrawn in 1914. By 1914 the railway had served over 10,000,000 passengers. To allow the through-running of L&YR; trains, the conductor rail was moved to outside the running rails and the centre rail became the earth return until the 1920s. The first automatic train-stop system was installed on the line, and was electrically operated. An arm on the trackside would be struck by each passing train, activating an electromagnet, resulting in a 'danger' signal being shown until the train had passed through the next station. As a result of automation, the number of manned signal boxes was reduced to two. The line upgraded the signalling from semaphore to a Westinghouse permanent daytime colour-light system in 1921: the first to be installed in Britain. The track also contained automatic braking systems for trains which ran through a red light; the current could be automatically disconnected and air brakes applied. The seventeenth and final station was opened on 16 June 1930, at Gladstone Dock, between Alexandra Dock and Seaforth Sands stations. Plans were put forward to extend the line from Herculaneum Dock to St Michaels, and from Seaforth Sands to Sefton, to create a circular route, using the Hunts Cross to Southport line, however, these were never carried out. With fewer ships docking in Liverpool during the Great Depression, there was a reduction in usage for the Overhead Railway. Tourist tickets were offered from 1932, which also included visits to ocean liners that were moored at the docks, as part of a scheme to increase ticket sales, along with reduced prices, and a major advertising campaign. During World War II, the railway suffered extensively from bomb damage. As a purely local undertaking, it was not nationalised in 1948 with the rest of the British railway system. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the company started to modernise some of the carriages, incorporating sliding doors. The line continued to carry large numbers of passengers, especially dock workers. The Mersey Docks & Harbour Board maintained stringent controls over the operation of the Overhead Railway for the duration of its operation. The Board protected its own freight transport interests by including clauses in the Overhead Railway's enabling legislation to limit the weight of parcels that could be transported, and renewing the lease on it every seven years. The Board blocked an attempt by the Liverpool Overhead Railway Company to extend its line to join the Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway at Seaforth for the purposes of transporting coal to Herculaneum Dock. The lack of development or rescue by the Board was at least in part due to its determination to restrict its activities to those that directly impacted the dock. Closure Dingle station, the only underground station, and one of its few remaining visible traces The railway was carried mainly on iron viaducts, with a corrugated iron decking onto which the tracks were laid. It was vulnerable to corrosion, especially as the steam-operated Docks Railway operated beneath some sections, despite the locomotives being fitted with chimney cowls which were intended to deflect the steam from the structure. Parts of the decking had become rusty on the surface, caused by steam and soot from the dock locomotives that passed underneath, mixing with rainwater to form an acid that began to corrode the metalwork. Drainage blockages combined with grit and constant vibration also played a part in the degradation of the structure. Alongside this deterioration of the railway, the company never made as much money as they had hoped. Passengers made shorter journeys over the years, with the average passenger value declining from 2d in 1897 to 1.7d in 1913. Electric trams were introduced and competed with the railway, reducing the number of people using it, and changes to ticketing increased operational costs for the company. A full-time maintenance team was employed solely for the Overhead Railway, but struggled to keep up with repairs, and costs began to rise steeply during the 1950s. In 1955, a survey discovered that repairs would be necessary in five years at a cost of ¬£2 million. The company could not afford such costs and looked for financial support, from the Liverpool Corporation, the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board and British Railways. A number of attempts to rescue the railway and arrange a takeover took place over the next year but were ultimately unsuccessful. The company went into voluntary liquidation, despite still being reporting to be profitable for its shareholders, and was relieved of its statutory obligation to operate passenger services with the Liverpool Overhead Railway Act 1956. Remnants of Overhead Railway supports built into a wall near Clarence Dock. Despite public protest, the line was closed on the evening of 30 December 1956. The final two scheduled trains were full of passengers and were timed to meet at Pier Head, where crowds gathered. It was the first electrified urban railway in the UK to close. A small number of staff were kept to maintain the buildings and structures, and it was hoped that a way of reopening the railway could be found. More than 100 members of the LOR staff joined British Railways for work after its closure. The railway was replaced by a bus service operated by Liverpool Corporation who purchased 60 new buses for the route. The price of a workman's return fare subsequently increased from 8d to 1s as workers were forced to use bus services.  Demolition  Demolition of the structure commenced on 23 September 1957, and all 80 acres of elevated were removed by January the following year. Little evidence of the railway remains, but a small number of columns set into walls at Huskisson Dock, and the tunnel at Herculaneum Dock into Dingle station have survived, the latter being used as a garage. The foundations of the double deck swing bridge at Stanley Dock also remain. One of the original wooden carriages, on a recreated section of elevated track, remains on display with other artefacts at the Museum of Liverpool, and the only surviving First class modernised carriage, No 7, was taken on by Coventry Railway Centre. On 24 July 2012 a portion of the terminal tunnel near Dingle collapsed. Rolling stock An electric train on the Liverpool Overhead Railway, photographed for the Street Railway Journal, 1902. Liverpool Overhead Railway carriage in the Museum of Liverpool, 2012 The railway used electric units with passenger accommodation and an electric motor in the same unit. Any number could be coupled together with all motors controlled by the driver. Built between 1892 and 1899 by Brown Marshall & Co, the original units had one motor, but by the third batch this had been replaced by a motor. In 1902 the motor cars were fitted with two motors, and these were replaced in 1919 by motors. Air brakes were fitted, the pressure topped up at the termini. In the early days a single motor coach ran off-peak, but the norm became a three-coach train consisting of two motor coaches with a trailer coach between. Two classes of accommodation were provided, originally first and second, becoming first and third in 1905 when the L&YR; began running over the railway. The cars were open with transverse seating: the central trailer had leather-covered seats for first class passengers; third class passengers had wooden seating. As the voltage was 500V, when they ran on the L&YR; 630V system the motors had to be in series mode. In 1945-47 a three car train was modernised, replacing the timber body with aluminium and plywood and fitting power-operated sliding doors under control of the guard. New trains were considered too expensive and six more trains were rebuilt. The Liverpool Overhead Railway operated one steam locomotive, called Lively Polly, an inside-cylinder 0-4-0WT, which was originally built in Leeds by Kitson for the West Lancashire Railway. It was used to deice the track and haul the maintenance train from its acquisition in the 1890s until it was sold to Rea Ltd, a coal merchant in Birkenhead in 1949. It was replaced by a Ruston diesel engine, which was bought in 1947. Both were fitted with the proprietary coupling used by the Overhead Railway's EMUs. An original train was kept by the Museum of Liverpool and a modernised carriage is stored at the Electric Railway Museum, Warwickshire. Film The railway is featured in the films Waterfront (1950) and The Magnet (1950), and in the final scenes of The Clouded Yellow (1951), as the character played by Jean Simmons uses it to travel to one of the docks. Extensive archive footage appears in Of Time and the City, a \\"cinematic autobiographical poem\\" made by British film-maker Terence Davies to celebrate Liverpool's 2008 reign as Capital of Culture. In 1897, the Lumi√®re brothers filmed Liverpool, including what is believed to be the first tracking shot, taken from the railway.

The term, often used pejoratively by liberal anti-fascists eschewing violence, originated in the Anti-Nazi League, an anti-fascist campaigning organisation dominated by the heterodox Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party (SWP). The SWP formed \\"squads\\", fighting units, in 1977, initially to defend and steward meetings against violent attacks from the fascist National Front. However, other anti-fascist squads emerged separately from the SWP, such as the Sari Squad. The name associated eventually with all of the fighting groups of that era, i.e., \\"Squads\\" originated with the already established Manchester-based anti fascist fighting group, drawn from many groups on the left and non-aligned anti fascists which first adopted the name \\"The Squad\\" for its, previously very ad hoc, fighting unit in 1977.Steve Tilzey and Dave Hann. No retreat Milo Books. 2003 The adoption of the name, \\"Squad\\", had only an accidental connection with the very similar \\"Peoples Squads\\" in Italy in the early 1920s. Squads were active in the North West of England and then Glasgow, the Midlands, Hatfield, and London in this period.Dave Hann Physical Resistance Zero Books, 2012, p.265-317Sean Birchall Beating the Fascists, Freedom Press, 2010 The core of the fighting units were SWP members, but also included many members of other left groups and non- aligned anti fascists. The squads were formed to directly combat the rising tide of fascist \\"street\\" violence being experienced by the Left, and black communities, during this period, from the National Front in particular. The regionally-based direct action squads operated within, but also considerably beyond, the ANL.A short history of the Anti-Nazi League Squad members also used violence and intimidation to break up meetings, marches and other gatherings of far right groups such as the National Front and the British Movement The idea behind the tactic was to ensure the safety of ANL and general left meetings through efficient stewarding, and also to generally intimidate groups seen as fascist, without generating media publicity for the far right. Squadism became increasingly frowned upon by the ANL/SWP leadership when the National Front's expansion fell away in the late 1970s. By 1979/80, the ANL leadership had decided that the National Front was a broken force, and so militant campaigning anti-fascism was no longer a priority.Dave Renton When We Touched the Sky Militant anti-fascists both within and without the SWP strongly disagreed with what they saw as a mistaken and opportunistic abandonment of militant activity.

Taglit is the Hebrew word for 'discovery'. During their trip, participants, most of whom are visiting Israel for the first time, are encouraged to discover new meaning in their personal Jewish identity and connection to Jewish history and culture. Since trips began in the winter of 1999, more than 600,000 young people from 67 countries have participated in the program.Article on Jerusalem Post About 80% of participants are from the United States and Canada. The number of participants has not grown beyond 40,000 a year due to budgetary constraints.  History  Taglit delegation, winter 2012 The Birthright Israel program was initiated in 1994 and founded in cooperation with Charles Bronfman and Michael Steinhardt, as well as the Israeli government, private donors, the Jewish Agency for Israel, and Jewish communities around the world.Saxe, L. & Chazan, B. (2008). Ten Days of Birthright Israel: A Journey in Young Adult Identity. Lebanon, NH: University Press of New England Tours are held in the winter and summer, for which demand is very high. Registration is conducted online and each round there are usually thousands more applicants than spaces available. In 2007, annual capacity was increased to 20,000 participants a year. That year, Sheldon Adelson pledged $25 million to Birthright Israel to take applicants off waiting lists and to increase annual capacity from 25,000 to 37,000 in 2007 and 2008. The Adelson Family Foundation has contributed many millions of US dollars annually to Birthright Israel since 2007.Adelson Foundation Gives Taglit An Extra $5 Million Boost, by Elad Benari, Israel National News, December 1, 2011 In 2011, he pledged an additional $5 million toward the effort. In 2013, Adelson doubled his past annual commitment to Birthright Israel, announcing a $20 million challenge grant that will match new and increased gifts or pledges through 2015. This raises Adelson's total support of the program to over $250 million as of February 2015. In 2010, Birthright launched an extension program called Birthright Excel. Birthright Excel is a 10-week summer program where students can either create a venture or intern with a business.  Eligibility  Eligible individuals are those who have at least one parent of recognized Jewish descent, or who have converted to Judaism through a recognized Jewish movement, and who do not actively practice another religion. They must also be between the ages of 18 to 32, have completed high school, have neither traveled to Israel before on a peer educational trip or study program past the age of 18, nor have lived in Israel past the age of 12. A Taglit-Birthright Israel trip includes airfare from major cities, hotels, most meals, all transportation within Israel, and costs associated with touring the country for the ten-day trip. A US$250 deposit is required, which is refunded upon return from the trip. Airfare or transportation from a participant's home to the gateway city is not included, although the trips depart from multiple cities.  Trip organizers  Trips are organized by different organizations and companies accredited by Taglit- Birthright Israel, which sets the logistical, educational, and security standards. All groups are led by licensed Israeli tour guides, all groups are accompanied by an armed security guard, and include visits to the Western Wall and Yad Vashem, as well as other sites determined by Taglit-Birthright Israel. Tours may vary according to age group and the religious background of the participants. Trips may be geared for graduate students, undergraduates at a particular university, participants from a particular city, participants who identify with a particular stream of Judaism, tours for hiking or music enthusiasts, and a diverse array of other interests, such Birthright's 12-day internship experience with Israel Tech Challenge. El Al, Israel's largest airline company, is the major operator of the trips' flights.  Itinerary  Tel Gezer with Birthright tourists, February 2013 Registration is conducted twice a year, in the winter and summer, and during each round there are thousands more applicants than spaces available. Trips are conducted throughout most of the year. A Taglit-Birthright Israel trip includes airfare from major cities, hotel accommodation, two meals per day, security, all transportation within Israel, and other costs associated with touring the country during the ten-day trip. A Ukrainian Taglit group in Israel, 2008 Tours travel throughout the country to religious and cultural sites, including in Jerusalem, the Western Wall, and the Dead Sea. Trips also often include a Mega Event, which unites thousands of participants from around the world together with Israelis for a celebration featuring speeches by dignitaries and musical performances. A major feature of the tours is a 5- to 10-day mifgash (Hebrew for 'encounter') with Israeli peers, usually soldiers serving in the Israel Defense Forces, who join the tour. The stated purpose for the mifgash is for the participants and the soldiers to get to know each other and to better understand each other's world view and Jewish identity. Guided discussion sessions explore topics such as the Jewish tradition in the modern world, how Jewish life in Israel differs from Jewish life abroad, and how mandatory military service impacts young Israelis' perceptions of service and commitment to their country. More than 65,000 Israelis have participated in the program since 2000.Taglit-Birthright Israel CEO Report (2001) Participants have the option to extend their plane ticket for up to three months to explore Israel and the region. The optional extension is not part of the Birthright trip, and the participant is in that time like any tourist.  Security measures  Security policies in place during the trip \\"ensure a comprehensive safety umbrella\\", as follows:Safety and Security Update * No travel to the West Bank, Gaza, or East Jerusalem other than the Jewish Quarter of the Old City * Participants in each group remain together at all times and follow a set schedule of activities * Participants do not leave the groups to travel, explore or visit with Israelis on their own during the ten-day trip * Public transportation is not allowed at any time * At least one highly trained, armed escort accompanies each group throughout the entire trip  Funding  Through the end of 2011, the program had an operating budget of $660 million. More than half of the funding comes from philanthropists, among them Charles Bronfman, Edgar Bronfman, Sr., Daniel Och, Marlene Post, Lynn Schusterman, Sheldon Adelson, and Michael Steinhardt. About one-quarter of funding comes from the Government of Israel, and about one-fifth is contributed by Jewish organizations and communities, such as North American Jewish Federations through the United Jewish Communities (UJC), Keren Hayesod, and the Jewish Agency for Israel; and many leading private philanthropists through the Birthright Israel Foundation, including Charles Bronfman, Michael Steinhardt, and Lynn Schusterman. The program also receives funding from the German government, through the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany. According to the organization, Taglit-Birthright Israel has contributed more than 2 billion NIS to the Israeli economy.'Birthright contributed NIS 2b. to Israeli economy', by Nadav Shemer, Jerusalem Post, February 26, 2012  Criticism  The Birthright Israel program has been criticized for its pre- trip screening process. According to Rachel Shabi from Salon.com, political opinions may be taken into account: \\"Potential candidates who are discovered to have a 'hidden agenda' are not allowed onto the [Birthright] trips\\".Come, see Palestine! Upstart tours of Palestine are challenging fully paid \\"See Israel\\" holidays in a battle for the hearts and minds of young American Jews Rachel Shabi, Salon.com, Jun 5, 2006 The pro-Palestinian Jewish Voice for Peace runs a campaign called Return the Birthright, which criticizes the Birthright Israel program and urges young Jews to boycott it, stating: \\"it's unjust that we get a free Birthright trip, while Palestinian refugees can't return to their homes\\". Alumni programs Michael Steinhardt, co-founder of Birthright Israel, is a major supporter of The Alumni Community and a primary provider of post-Birthright Israel programs in the New York area. Through its follow-up programs, in which 15,000 alumni participate every year, young Jews continue to learn about Jewish culture and history. I.D., a performance of monologues by Birthright Israel alumni based on their experiences, is sponsored by Birthright Israel Next, which keeps in touch with alumni by hosting trips, reunions and other programs. Social impact At an academic symposium on Taglit-Birthright held at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 2013, Leonard Saxe of Brandeis University presented evidence that program participants tend to marry later than their peers, and are more likely to marry within the faith than a similar group of Jewish young people who choose not to participate in Birthright. Saxe hypothesizes that participants' delayed marriage age may be motivated by the goal of finding a Jewish spouse. The findings also show that one out of four Birthright participants ends up marrying another Birthright participant.  Similar trips  Birthright Israel has inspired similar programs for other diasporas with similar goals, including Birthright Armenia for the Armenian diaspora, Reconnect Hungary for young adults of Hungarian diaspora, and Birthright Greece for the Greek diaspora. Birthright Unplugged was founded to counterbalance Birthright Israel, with the goal of exposing Jewish and non-Jewish visitors to Palestinian communities inside and outside of Israel.

At one time there was an inn at the summit of the pass, called the \\"Prince Llewellyn Inn\\" but it was popularly known as \\"the Crimea\\", because of its reputation for fights.

The quarry was not a great success and it was sold to the owner of the Prince Llewellyn quarry in late 1876. There is a track above the road which follows the route of the old road across the pass, described as a cleverly constructed route with gradients appropriate for a time when horses were the source of power.

They all approximated in weight and fineness to the Spanish dollar, which had set the standard for a de facto common currency for trade in the Far East. History Chinese dragon dollar of 1904 The existence of trade dollars came about because of the popularity of the silver Spanish dollar in China and East Asia. Following the establishment of the Spanish Philippines, Intramuros became an entrep√¥t for Chinese goods in one direction and silver, from across the Pacific to the Spanish held silver mines of Mexico, in the other. This so-called \\"Manila Galleons\\" trade route, led from the 16th Century onwards to the wide circulation of \\"pieces of eight\\" in East Asia. The high regard in which these coins came to be held, led to the minting of the silver Chinese yuan, a coin designed to resemble the Spanish one. These Chinese \\"dragon dollars\\" not only circulated in China, but together with original coins of Spanish-Mexican origin became the preferred currency of trade between China and its neighbours. Defeated in the First Opium War China was forced to open its ports to foreign trade, and in the late half of the 19th Century Western nations trading with China found it cheaper and more expedient to mint their own coins, from their own supplies of silver, than to continue to use coins from Mexican sources. These so-called trade dollars would approximate in specification, weight 7 mace and 2 candareens (approx. 27.2 grams) and fineness .900 (90%), the Spanish-Mexican coins so long trusted and valued in China. French Indochina Piastre 1885 France To control the money supply in French Indochina in 1885, the French introduced a new silver Piastre de commerce and associated subsidiary coinage throughout the entire Indo-Chinese colonies in order to increase monetary stability. The piastre was initially equivalent to the Mexican peso. The piastre was therefore a direct lineal descendant of the Spanish pieces of eight that had been brought to the Orient from Mexico on the Manila Galleons. It was initially on a silver standard of 1 piastre = 24.4935 grams pure silver. This was reduced to 24.3 grams in 1895. Japan Japanese Trade Dollar dated 1875 The Japanese Trade Dollar was a dollar coin, issued from 1875 to 1877. It was minted of 27.22 g of silver with a fineness of .900 (90%). The Yen coin had 26.96 g of silver at that time, and otherwise nearly identical in design to the trade dollar. 2,736,000 coins of this type were minted, the vast majority in 1876-77.Krause, Chester L. and Mishler, Clifford: 1996 Standard Catalog of World Coins (Iola, WI: Krause Publications, ), p. 1374. When Japan introduced the gold standard in 1897, the silver 1 yen coins, including the trade dollars, were demonetized. The majority of the trade dollars were counterstamped with the character \\"gin\\" (Japanese for \\"silver\\"). The Osaka mint placed the mark on the left side of the reverse, the Tokyo mint on the right. The coins were then released for use in Japanese-occupied Taiwan, Korea and L√ºshunkou.Krause, Chester L. and Mishler, Clifford: 1996 Standard Catalog of World Coins (Iola, WI: Krause Publications, ), p. 1370. United Kingdom A Trade Dollar from the reign of Victoria. It is dated 1900 and minted at the Bombay mint. With the extension of British trading interests in the East, especially after the founding of Singapore in 1819 and Hong Kong in 1842, it became necessary to produce a special Dollar so as to remove the reliance of a British Colony upon the various foreign coins then in circulation. \\"China trade silver dollars\\" were a direct result of the First (18391842) and Second Opium War (18561860), which broke out when Chinese authorities tried to stop Britain from smuggling opium into the country. The loser, China, had to open up a number of ports to British trade and residence, and cede Hong Kong to Britain. In the decades that followed, merchants and adventurers flocked to these areas, and international trade flourished. Foreign banks were established and large silver coins from all over the world began arriving to pay for tea, silk and Chinese porcelain to be shipped abroad. These .900 fine silver trade dollars were then circulated throughout China, where they were readily accepted as a medium of exchange. The British Trade Dollars, minted exclusively for use in the Far East, depict Britannia standing on shore, holding a trident in one hand and balancing a British shield in the other, with a merchant ship under full sail in the background. On the reverse is an arabesque design with the Chinese symbol for longevity in the center, and the denomination in two languages - Chinese and Jawi Malay. The British Trade Dollar was designed by George William De Saulles and minted from 1895 for Hong Kong and the Straits Settlements. But after the Straits dollar was introduced to the Straits Settlements in 1903, it became exclusively a Hong Kong coin produced until 1935. Those with the mint mark \\"B\\" were produced at the Bombay Mint; others, marked \\"C\\", were struck in Calcutta. Those with no mint mark were produced in London. The mint mark \\"C\\" can be found in the ground between the left foot of Britannia and the base of the shield, while the mint mark \\"B\\" is located in the center prong of the trident. The 1921-B dollar was struck but never released for circulation, and only a limited number of 1934-B and 1935-B coins were released. In some cases, the date on an already manufactured coin die was altered. As this could not be done without leaving a trace of the former date, some coins show traces of an older date below the clearly visible date. These include 1897-B over 1896-B, 1900-B over 1894-B, 1901-B over 1900-B, 1909-B over 1908-B, 1904-B over 1898-B, 1903-B over 1902-B, 1908-B over 1903-B, 1904-B over 1903-B, 1929-B over 1901-B, 1908-B over 1907-B, and 1910-B over 1900-B. The British Trade Dollar was demonetized on 1August 1937. United States 1873 United States Trade Dollar pattern. The United States trade dollar is a silver (fineness of .900 or 90%) dollar coin that was issued by the United States Mint and minted in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Carson City, and San Francisco from 1873 to 1885. Business strike trade dollars were last produced in 1878 and proof coin production continued until 1885. The coin weighs 420 grains (27.2 g), about 8 grains (0.52 g) more than the domestic silver dollar (Seated Liberty Dollars and Morgan Dollars) of the time. It is 4 grains heavier than the Mexican peso; however, the peso is .903 silver. The coin was designed by William Barber, the mint's chief engraver. More trade dollars were minted in San Francisco than Carson City and Philadelphia combined. San Francisco was closest both to the source of the silver as well as the ultimate destination of the coins, China. Many Trade dollars have what are called \\"chopmarks\\" on them. Chinese merchants would stamp the coins in order to verify their correct weight and value. The United States Congress authorized the U.S. Mint to create a trade dollar to improve trade with the Orient, China in particular. Prior to that, the Mexican peso had been the primary silver coin used in trading with China. In fact, the eagle on the trade dollar's reverse looks quite similar to the peso's. Collectors are warned that recently a large number of U.S. Trade dollars have been forged in China made with base metal. Careful testing or purchasing from known dealers or buying sealed and certified coins may be necessary to avoid these fakes. ReferencesExternal links *US Trade Dollar by year and type.

Although City Hall has frontage on two major streets, the main entrance is on Laurier Avenue, and the municipal address is 110 Laurier Avenue West. Veterans' Grove Korean War Memorial in Veterans' Grove beside Ottawa City Hall On 5 November 1998, an area located beside Ottawa City Hall was named Veterans' Grove by Bob Chiarelli in honour of War Veterans from the Ottawa-Carleton Region. A pink granite memorial dedicated to the memory of Canadians who had enlisted in Ottawa for service with the Canadian Army Special Force and members of Canada's Regular Forces who made the supreme sacrifice during the War in Korea was moved to its current location in Veterans' Grove in 1998. It was originally unveiled on 27 July 1994 at the site of the old City Hall on Sussex Drive. Main building Ottawa Fire Fighters Memorial The modern wing, which serves as the main section of City Hall, was designed by Raymond Moriyama and built in 1990 as the headquarters of the former Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton. It is located between the Cartier Square Drill Hall and the Ottawa Court House. This section of City Hall contains the Council chamber (known as Andrew Haydon Hall), a large atrium and a number of offices and public services. The front of the building is marked by a large open plaza that faces Confederation Park across Laurier Avenue. The plaza is home to concerts, festivals, and other community events. The grounds have a number of features, including a sound sculpture, fountain and artificial ice-skating pad. The site had originally been the parade ground for the Drill Hall. During the Second World War, a complex of structures was erected to house military staff. These buildings were meant to be temporary, but they remained in place for several decades. They were eventually demolished and the City Hall and courthouse were built on the site. The Regional Headquarters building was chosen as the new City Hall upon the amalgamation of the Region and its constituent municipalities in 2001, largely due to its central location. The architecturally acclaimed John G. Diefenbaker Building, located to the east of downtown, was subsequently sold to the federal government. Heritage Building Heritage Building section of Ottawa City Hall facing Elgin Street South of the courthouse on Elgin Street stands the old Ottawa Normal School, built in 1875, and which now serves as the \\"Heritage Building\\" section of City Hall. Connected to the modern wing, the Heritage Building contains the offices of the Mayor and members of Council (the mayor's office overlooks Elgin Street), as well as a number of offices and committee rooms (including one committee room located in the former gymnasium of the Normal School). The Heritage Building was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1974. Public art Throughout the buildings of Ottawa's City Hall, there are various pieces of art that were commissioned specifically for the location. The following pieces can currently be found there: * Family Portrait by Stephen Brathwaite * Structure by Stephen Brathwaite * V.I.P. by Michael Bussiere * Sachi's Isochron by Warren Carther * Fable by Trevor Gould * Nautilus by Paula Murray * The Lost Child by David Piqtoukun * On Top of the World by Jim Thomson * The Living Room by URBAN KEIOS  Sens Rink of Dreams  The Rink of Dreams at night Since 2013, the Ottawa Senators Foundation has funded a 12,500 square foot ice rink in front of Ottawa City Hall.

The bastide hall and the church were often first constructed of wood. After the bastide was established, they were replaced by structures of stone. Structural elements Scholarly debate has taken place over the exact definition of a bastide. They are now generally described as any town planned and built as a single unit, by a single founder. Most bastides were developed with a grid layoutHistorians have classified other planned new towns of Languedoc- Roussillon, built on a circular plan, as circulades. of intersecting streets, with wide thoroughfares that divide the town plan into insulae, or blocks, through which a narrow lane often runs. They included a central market square surrounded by arcades (couverts) through which the axes of thoroughfares passed, with a covered weighing and measuring area. The market square often provided the module into which the bastide is subdivided.Randolph 1995:297 The Roman model, the castrum with its grid plan and central forum, was inescapable in a region since Roman planning precedents survived in medieval cities such as B√©ziers, Narbonne, Toulouse, Orange and Arles. The region of the bastides had been one of the last outposts of Late Antiquity in the West.C. Goudineau, P.A. F√©vrier and M. Fixot, \\"Le r√©seau urbain,\\" in Georges Duby, ed. Histoire de la France urbaine Paris 1980, pp 71-137. Central square The Aquitain Model of a Bastide The main feature of all bastides is a central, open place, or square. It was used for markets, but also used for political and social gatherings. A typical square, (which was probably a model for other bastides), can be found in Montauban. Generally, there is just one square. Saint-Lys and Albias are different because they have two squares, one for the market and one square for the church. The square is also used to divide the city into quarters. Generally, it lies outside the main street (the axis) which carried the traffic. There are three possible layouts: Completely closed: The square does not touch any street. These are very rare; there is one example at Tournay with a size of 70 metres (230 ft) by 72 m (236 ft)). Single-axis: The single-axis design of the bastide makes all roads run in one direction and are parallel. Here and there, there are alleys cut between the roads. The square is placed between two roads. These squares are usually 50 m (164 ft) to 55 m (180 ft) on each side. Grid-layout; usually based on the square in Montauban. Generally the flattest place in the bastide was used for the square. Church The church was almost never on the central square but usually at an angle, facing the square diagonally. One of the rare exceptions is Villefranche-de-Rouergue but this one was built two centuries after the square. Houses Model of Bastide in GasconThere were clear rules how houses could be built inside the bastide. The front of the houses, the fa√ßades, had to line up. Also, there had to be a small space between the houses. The different housing lots were all alike, 8 m (26 ft) by 24 m (79 ft) being a common size. There were only a limited number of lots. This varied between ten and several thousand (3,000 in Grenade-sur-Garonne) Streets The streets were usually 6 m (20 ft) ‚Äì 10 m (33 ft) wide, so a chariot could pass through. They ran alongside the fa√ßades of the houses. Alleys run between streets, these are usually only 5 m (16 ft) ‚Äì 6 m (20 ft) wide. Sometimes, they are only 2 m (7 ft) ‚Äì 2.5 m (8 ft) wide. In a bastide there were usually between one and eight streets. City walls Aigues-Mortes Walls When bastides were founded, most had no city walls or fortifications because it was a peaceful time in history, and walls were prohibited by the Treaty of Paris (1229). Fortifications were added later and were paid for through a special tax or carried out through a law that required the people of the city to help build the walls. A good example is Libourne. Ten years after the city was founded, the people asked for money to build city walls. Once they had received the money, they spent it on making their city prettier, rather than building walls. At the beginning of the Hundred Years' War, many bastides that had no city walls were destroyed. Some of the others quickly built stone walls to protect the city. Structure and location Bastides in 1271Ease of tax collection was another reason for the grid layout, as the village was taxable module by module, and the organized central area. The bastides' forms resulted from \\"the friction engendered by interaction, expedience, pragmatism, legal compromise, and profit,\\" Adrian Randolph observed in 1995.Randolph 1995:291. More rarely, such planned cities were developed according to a circular plan.K. Pawloski, \\"Villes et villages circulaire du Languedoc\\" Annales du Midi 9 (1987) pp 407-28. Some bastides were not so geometrically planned: \\"The block geometry of the bastides was not a rigid framework into which a town was squeezed; it resembles more closely a net, thrown upon the site and adapting to its nuances,\\" Randolph remarks.Randolph 1995:301. Most bastides were built in the Lot-et-Garonne, Dordogne, Gers and Haute-Garonne d√©partements of France, because of the altitude and quality of the soil. Some were constructed in important defensive positions. The best-known today is probably Andorra la Vella, but the most populated is Villeneuve-sur-Lot, the \\"new town on the River Lot\\".

Narvskie Triumfal'nyye vorota) was erected in the vast Narva Square (known as Stachek Square since 1923), Saint Petersburg, in 1814 to commemorate the Russian victory over Napoleon. The wooden structure was constructed on the Narva highway with the purpose of greeting the soldiers who were returning from abroad after their victory over Napoleon. The architect of the original Narva Arch was Giacomo Quarenghi. The program was meant to respond to the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel in Paris, originally erected to celebrate Napoleon's victory over the Allies at Austerlitz, but the material used was a weather- resistant plaster that was never intended to be permanent. Between 1827 and 1834 Vasily Stasov redesigned and rebuilt the gate in stone. A similar gate, also by Stasov, was erected on the road leading to Moscow. A sculptor Vasily Demut-Malinovsky was responsible for the arch's sculptural decor. As has been conventional since Imperial Roman times, sculptures of Pheme offering laurel wreaths fill the spandrels of the central arch. The main entablature breaks boldly forward over paired Composite columns that flank the opening and support colossal sculptures. Nike, the Goddess of Victory, surmounts the arch, in a triumphal car drawn by six horses, sculpted by Peter Clodt von J√ºrgensburg, instead of the traditional Quadriga. Neither the arch nor the Russian Admiralty were protected from artillery bombardments during the Siege of Leningrad. The arch was restored in 1951. A small military museum was opened in the upper part of the arch in 1989. At the beginning of 21st century the gate was completely restored and according to experts, is in a fine condition as of August 2009.

The museum specializes in the preservation and display of outsider art (also known as \\"intuitive art,\\" \\"raw art,\\" or \\"art brut\\"). The city agreed to give the museum a piece of land on the south shore of the Inner Harbor under the condition that its organizers would clean up residual pollution from a copper paint factory and a whiskey warehouse that formerly occupied the site. It has been designated by Congress as America's national museum for visionary art. AVAM's 1.1 acre campus contains 67,000 square feet of exhibition space and a permanent collection of approximately 4,000 pieces. The permanent collection includes works by visionary artists like Ho Baron, Nek Chand, Howard Finster, Vanessa German, Mr. Imagination (aka Gregory Warmack), Leonard Knight, William Kurelek, Leo Sewell, Judith Scott, Ben Wilson, as well as over 40 pieces from the Cabaret Mechanical Theatre of London. AVAM artists, the museum boasts, include ‚Äúfarmers, housewives, mechanics, the disabled, the homeless. . . all inspired by the fire within.‚Äù The museum's Main Building features three floors of exhibition space, and the campus includes a Tall Sculpture Barn and Wildflower Garden, along with large exhibition and event spaces in the Jim Rouse Visionary Center. The museum has no staff curators, preferring to use guest curators for its shows. Rather than focusing shows on specific artists or styles, it sponsors themed exhibitions with titles such as Wind in Your Hair and High on Life. The museum's founder, Rebecca Alban Hoffberger, takes pride in the fact that AVAM is \\"pretty un-museumy\\". History The founder and director of the AVAM is Rebecca Alban Hoffberger, who while working in the development department of Sinai Hospital's (Baltimore) People Encouraging People (a program geared toward aiding psychiatric patients in their return to the community) began to develop the idea for a visionary museum, an idea that eventually blossomed into the American Visionary Art Museum, or AVAM. Initially, Hoffberger was simply interested in the artwork created by the patients in the People Encouraging People program, and found herself ‚Äúimpressed with their imagination‚Äù and looking to ‚Äútheir strengths, not their illnesses.‚Äù Hoffberger found inspiration on a visit to the Collection de l'art brut in Lausanne, Switzerland, which was established by French artist Jean Dubuffet as a collection of ‚Äúl'art brut‚Äù or ‚Äúraw art because of the untamed emotions resonating in it.‚Äù Hoffberger described the museum as ‚Äúthe best, the most imaginative, the most original museum‚Äù and soon adopted the idea of ‚Äúl'art brut‚Äù for her own visionary museum. To gauge the community's interest in visionary art, Hoffberger and gallery owner George Ciscle held an exhibit in 1987 titled ‚ÄúAmerican Outsider Art,‚Äù at which point she formally announced her plans for the American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore. With the support of her friends and family, Hoffberger petitioned the city of Baltimore and was eventually awarded two buildings near the city's Inner Harbor worth $1.1 million. Hoffberger has said that she ‚Äúpublicly bent over backwards to not go to traditional art funders.\\" The State of Maryland also issued $1.3 million in bonds to finance the construction, which helped jump-start the building process. Hoffberger also relied heavily on contributions and donations, a tradition that continues to keep the museum running today. Hoffberger raised $7 million in six years from donors such as Anita Roddick. Designed by architects Rebecca Swanston and Alex Castro,Dorsey, John & Dilts, James D., Guide to Baltimore Architecture (1997) p. 218. Tidewater Publishers, Centreville, Maryland the museum officially opened to the public on November 24, 1995. Visionary artists Gerald Hawkes and Vollis Simpson were the first people to step through the doors. In collaboration with the event's founder, Hobart Brown, AVAM brought the Kinetic Sculpture Race to the East coast in 1999 as an annual event. In 2004 the museum opened its third building, the Jim Rouse Visionary Center, converted from a former whiskey warehouse. The Jim Rouse Visionary Center houses such items as Kinetic Sculptures from AVAM's annual race, Baltimore painted screens, Leonard Knight's ‚ÄúLove Balloon,‚Äù DeVon Smith's ‚ÄúWorld‚Äôs First Robot Family,‚Äù and an interactive display of automata from London's Cabaret Mechanical Theatre. It also features two classrooms and a 3rd floor banquet room that can accommodate up to 400 people for the museum's programs & engagements, as well as private rentals. In 2005, AVAM began its popular ‚ÄúFlicks from the Hill‚Äù series with generous support from the Hughes family. Each summer, the free, outdoor family film series features a selection of movies inspired by the museum's current thematic exhibition. The films are projected on a large screen mounted below artist Adam Kurtzman's ‚ÄúGiant Golden Hand‚Äù in ‚ÄúThe Hughes Family Outdoor Theater,‚Äù and the natural amphitheater of Federal Hill can seat more than 1000 visitors for this popular outdoor film series. The museum's many other programs include a summer arts camp and after-school program, established in 2009. AVAM is also a popular venue for weddings, hosting over 70 weddings annually. Rental/admission fees accounted for 72% of earned income in 2011, nearly three times the average for an art museum. AVAM is seeking to raise a $25 million endowment before ‚Äúexploring the many offers to establish a West coast branch.‚Äù Mission Hoffberger has said that ‚Äúa good museum does more than just have objects that stand there on pedestals. The great ones are all muse-based, connecting viewers to the heart of inspiration.‚Äù AVAM's educational goals are another example of the museum's unorthodoxy. They are: * Expand the definition of a worthwhile life * Engender respect for and delight in the gift of others * Increase awareness of the wide variety of choices available in life for all ... particularly students * Encourage each individual to build upon his or her own special knowledge and inner strengths * Promote the use of innate intelligence, intuition, self-exploration and creative self-reliance * Confirm the great hunger for finding out just what each of us can do best, in our own voice, at any age. * Empower the individual to choose to do that something really, really well. These same goals were adopted by The Lower East Side Girls Club when it was founded in 1996. Reception The art car At the time of the museum's 1995 opening, it had been reported that Hoffberger's rejection of academic scholarship and her refusal to follow tradition perhaps had upset prominent members of the art world. Despite this, the museum won the support of collectors, critics, and the public through its exhibitions that examine the relationship of art to the human condition rather than to the canon of art history. In her inaugural address, Hoffberger stated that ‚Äúthe American Visionary Art Museum opens its doors of perception not in an effort to make war on academic or institutionalized learning, but to create a place where the best of self-taught, intuitive contributions of all kinds will be duly recognized, explored, and then championed in a clear strong voice.‚Äù Since its designation‚Äîby a unanimous vote of the U.S. Congress‚Äîas America's \\"official national education center, repository and museum for self-taught, intuitive artistry,\\" the museum has produced 18 thematic \\"mega-exhibitions\\" (as of 2012); added The Jim Rouse Visionary Center (in 2004) which more than doubled its exhibition space and provided an expansive, permanent home to its education department; and added new features to the Baltimore cultural landscape (including the Hughes Family Outdoor Theater, the LeRoy Hoffberger Speaker's Corner, and more). AVAM's Flicks from the Hill Outdoor Movie Series was included in Travel + Leisure magazine's list of \\"World's Best Free Stuff.\\" Further, the magazine also cited AVAM as one of the \\"10 Places to See Before You're 10.\\" Community involvement American Visionary Art Museum's Kinetic Sculpture Race, Baltimore, Maryland. AVAM has a long history of programs and practices intended to better the community. In 1997, several of AVAM's few full-time employees were hired directly from local homeless shelters. The murals which constitute the Museum's exterior walls were created and installed by members of AVAM's youth-at-risk and youth-incarcerated mosaic apprenticeship program in 2000. AVAM sponsors Baltimore artistic events, including art car events and the annual East Coast Championship Kinetic Sculpture Race. In 2010, AVAM started an After School program in collaboration with nearby Federal Hill Preparatory School, giving students access to the museum's collections and art workshop offerings. In October 2012, some pieces made by these students were auctioned off to benefit the Children's Home in Catonsville. AVAM expanded the program to a series of free workshops, called The Institute for Visionary Explorers, in the Enoch Pratt Free Library in 2012. AVAM was also the site of the inaugural Steps for the Cure, a breast cancer awareness event and fundraiser.

He was during the 19th century regarded as the father of modern poetry in Sweden, mainly through the national romantic epic Frithjof's Saga. He has been called Sweden's first modern man. Much is known about him, and he also wrote openly about himself.  Early life  His father was a pastor, and his grandparents on both sides were peasants. His father, whose name had been Esaias Lucasson, took the surname of Tegn√©rus‚Äîaltered by his fifth son, the poet, to Tegn√©r‚Äîfrom the village of Tegnaby in the province of Sm√•land, where he was born. In 1792 Tegn√©rus died. In 1799 Esaias Tegn√©r, hitherto educated in the country, entered Lund University, where he graduated in philosophy in 1802, and continued as tutor until 1810, when he was elected Greek lecturer. In 1806 he married Anna Maria Gustava Myhrman, to whom he had been attached since his earliest youth. In 1812 he was named professor, and continued to work as a lecturer in Lund until 1824, when he was made Bishop of V√§xj√∂. He remained in V√§xj√∂ until his death, twenty-two years later. He was comparatively slow in development. His first great success was a dithyrambic war-song for the army of 1808. In 1811 his patriotic poem Svea won the great prize of the Swedish Academy, and made him famous. In the same year was founded in Stockholm the Gothic League (G√∂tiska f√∂rbundet), a sort of club of young and patriotic men of letters, of whom Tegn√©r quickly became the chief. The club published a magazine, entitled Iduna, in which it printed a great deal of excellent poetry, and ventilated its views, particularly as regards the study of Icelandic literature and old Norse history. Tegn√©r, Geijer, Afzelius, and Nicander became the most famous members of the Gothic League.  Lund poems  Title page of Frithiofs Saga (1876) The majority of the many poems from Tegn√©r in Lund are short, but some are in lyrics. They are still shown to visitors as the Tegn√©r museum. His celebrated Song to the Sun dates from 1817. He completed three poems of a more ambitious character, on which his fame chiefly rests. Of these, the romance of Axel (1822) and the delicately chiselled idyl of Nattvardsbarnen (1820), translated by Longfellow, take a secondary place in comparison with Tegn√©r's masterpiece of worldwide fame. In 1819 he also became a member of the distinguished Swedish Academy, on seat 8.  Claim to recognition  In 1820 he published in Iduna fragments of an epic on which he was working: Frithjof's saga. In 1822 he published five more cantos, and in 1825 the entire poem. Already before its last canto it was famous throughout Europe; the aged Goethe took up his pen to commend to his countrymen this alte, kr√§ftige, gigantischbarbarische Dichtart and desired Amalie von Imhoff to translate it into German. This romantic paraphrase of an ancient saga was composed in twenty-four cantos, all differing in verse form, modeled somewhat, on an earlier Danish masterpiece, Helge of Oehlenschl√§ger. Frithjof's saga was during the 19th century the best known of all Swedish productions. It is said to have been translated twenty-two times into English, twenty times into German, and once at least into every European language. It is far from satisfying the demands of more recent antiquarian research, but it still is allowed to give the freshest existing impression, in imaginative form, of life in early Scandinavia.  Later life  Statue of Tegn√©r, right by Lund Cathedral in central Lund The period of the publication of Frithjof's saga (1825) was the critical epoch of his career. It made him one of the most famous poets in Europe. It transferred him from his study in Lund to the bishop's palace in V√§xj√∂; it marked the first breakdown of his health, which had hitherto been excellent; and it witnessed a singular moral crisis in the inner history of the poet, about which much has been written, but of which little is known. Tegn√©r was at this time passionately in love with a certain beautiful Euphrosyne Palm, the wife of a town councillor in Lund, and this unfortunate passion, while it inspired much of his finest poetry, turned the poet's blood to gall. From this time forward the heartlessness of woman is one of Tegn√©r's principal themes.  Bishop's seat  It is a remarkable sign of the condition of Sweden at that time that a man without a Christian heritage, and with little interest in formal religious matters, should be offered and should accept a bishop's crosier. He did not hesitate in accepting it: it was a great honour; he was poor; and he was anxious to get away from Lund. No sooner, however, had he begun to study for his new duties than he began to regret the step he had taken. It was nevertheless too late to go back, and Tegn√©r made a respectable bishop as long as his health lasted. In 1835, he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. But he became moody and melancholy; as early as 1833 he complained of fiery heats in his brain, and in 1840, during a visit to Stockholm, he suddenly became insane.  Mental deterioration He was sent to an asylum in Schleswig, and early in 1841 he was cured, and able to return to V√§xj√∂. In later years Tegn√©r began, but left unfinished, two important epic poems, Gerda and Kronbruden. It was during his convalescence in Schleswig that he composed Kronbruden. He wrote no more of importance; in 1843 he had a stroke of apoplexy, and on 2 November 1846 he died in V√§xj√∂. Tegn√©rmuseet in Lund Tegn√©rmuseet Tegn√©rmuseet is a museum devoted exclusively to the life and work of Esaias Tegn√©r. The museum is located in the house where Esaias Tegn√®r lived with his family from 1813 to 1826 in the city center of Lund. Since 1997, the museum has been part of the foundation Kulturen, which also operates the open-air museum in Lund. NotesReferences * This work in turn cites: ** C. W.

GKRP binds and moves glucokinase (GK), thereby controlling both activity and intracellular location of this key enzyme of glucose metabolism. GKRP is a 68 kD protein of 626 amino acids. It is coded for by a 19 exon gene, GCKR, on the short arm of chromosome 2 (2p23). GKRP was discovered by Emile van Schaftingen and reported in 1989  Physiological function  Glucokinase (GK) in liver cells phosphorylates glucose, preparing it for incorporation into glycogen or for the glycolysis . During periods of ample glucose supply, most GK activity can be found in the peripheral cytoplasm where glycogen synthesis is occurring. As the glucose supply declines during periods of fasting, GK activity in the cytoplasm diminishes. GKRP participates in this modulation of GK activity and location by binding free cytoplasmic GK as glucose levels decline, and moving it into the nucleus, where it is held in reserve in an inactive form. As glucose and insulin levels rise, as during digestion of a meal, GK is released from GKRP and moves back to the cytoplasm, where much of it associates with the bifunctional enzyme. In hepatocytes of various mammals, GKRP has always been found in molar excess of the amount of GK, but the GKRP:GK ratio varies according to diet, insulin sufficiency, and other factors. Free GKRP shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. It may be attached to the microfilament cytoskeleton. GKRP competes with glucose to bind with GK, but inactivates it when bound. In conditions of low glucose, GKRP then pulls the GK into the nucleus. Rising amounts of glucose coming into the hepatocyte prompt the GKRP to rapidly release GK to return to the cytoplasm. GKRP itself is subject to modulation. Fructose and sorbitol can both be converted to fructose-1-phosphate, which inhibits GKRP and frees GK. Fructose 6-phosphate binds to the same site of GKRP, but enhances the ability of GKRP to bind and inactivate GK. In contrast, phosphorylation of GKRP by AMP-activated protein kinase, induced by elevated levels of AMP, reduces its capacity to inactivate GK.  Presence of GKRP in other organs  A presence and role of GKRP in other organs and tissues beyond the liver remains uncertain. Some researchers have finding small amounts of GKRP, or at least RNA coding for it, in small amounts in certain rat lung cells, in pancreatic islet cells, and in periventricular neurons of the hypothalamus in rats, but physiological function and significance in these organs are unknown.  Species differences  GKRP was originally discovered in rat liver. GKRP was found to serve a similar function in livers of mice and humans as well as other animals. Cats are unusual in lacking GK activity, and have also been found to lack GKRP, though the genes for both GK and GKRP can be identified in the feline genome.  Clinical significance  Many mutant forms of human GK are associated with impaired or amplified insulin secretion or action, resulting in higher or lower blood glucose levels, and either diabetes (MODY2) or hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, respectively. Some of these variants have altered interaction with GKRP, which may contribute to the hyperglycemia. The glucokinase of \\"knockout mice\\" who lack GKRP is entirely found in the cytoplasm. They do not respond rapidly to glucose, exhibiting impaired glucose tolerance. Mutations of the GKRP gene (GCKR) in humans have been sought as possible causes of monogenic diabetes (MODY), but no examples have yet been discovered. However, variant forms of GCKR have been found to be associated with small differences in levels of glucose, insulin, triglycerides, C-reactive protein, and higher or lower risks for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Activators of GK are being investigated as possible medicines for type 2 diabetes. One of the mechanisms of activation may be protection from binding by GKRP.

History Before the establishment of the Department of PSEPC by the Emergency Preparedness Act of 1988, the agency that existed was known as Emergency Preparedness Canada, which was created under the auspices of the Department of National Defence. Legislation would begin in February 2001 for PSEPC, which would be created in December 2003 during a reorganization of the federal government. It became legally established when the Department of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Act came into force on 4 April 2005. The department was created to have a single entity with responsibility for ensuring public safety in Canada and is a direct result of lessons learned from the September 11 attacks on the United States in 2001. The department is in many ways similar to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, though it does not cover the protection of maritime sovereignty (which is covered by the Canadian Forces, Transport Canada, and Fisheries and Oceans Canada).  Overview = Legislation  The Department of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Act is an Act, coming into force on 4 April 2005, that passed as Chapter 10 in the Statutes of Canada of 2005 by the Parliament of Canada during the Martin government. Beginning to take shape in February 2001, the Act was officially created in December 2003 during a reorganization of the federal government. The Department of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness became legally established when this Act came to be. Structure Most of the department comprises organizations that were previously placed under the Department of Solicitor General of Canada, however the reorganization of several federal departments and ministries added the Canada Border Services Agency to the portfolio, after the two streams of the former Canada Customs and Revenue Agency were split in 2003. In addition, the Office of Critical Infrastructure Protection and Emergency Preparedness (OCIPEP) from the Department of National Defence was also brought into the department.

The medal was established on 27 June 1908 and the first recipient of the award was Rear Admiral John E. Pillsbury. Award criteria To be awarded the West Indies Campaign Medal, a service member must have performed sea duty in the West Indies between the dates of 1 May 1898 and 16 August 1898. The award was a one time decoration only and there were no devices authorized for multiple engagements or combat participation. The decoration was rarely bestowed, since most Navy and Marine Corps personnel received the Sampson Medal for West Indies service, and Navy regulations prohibited the bestowal of both the Sampson Medal and West Indies Campaign Medal for the same period of duty. Obsolescence The West Indies Campaign Medal was declared obsolete by the U.S. Navy in 1913, following a diplomatic request by Spain that the United States discontinue service medals which displayed Spain's national colors. As a result, those who had previously received the West Indies Campaign Medal were permitted to exchange the decoration for the Spanish Campaign Medal.

It is a statistic designed to help to compare how these price relatives, taken as a whole, differ between time periods or geographical locations. Price indices have several potential uses. For particularly broad indices, the index can be said to measure the economy's general price level or a cost of living. More narrow price indices can help producers with business plans and pricing. Sometimes, they can be useful in helping to guide investment. Some notable price indices include: * Consumer price index * Producer price index * Employment cost index * Export price index * Import price index * GDP deflator  History of early price indices  No clear consensus has emerged on who created the first price index. The earliest reported research in this area came from Welshman Rice Vaughan, who examined price level change in his 1675 book A Discourse of Coin and Coinage. Vaughan wanted to separate the inflationary impact of the influx of precious metals brought by Spain from the New World from the effect due to currency debasement. Vaughan compared labor statutes from his own time to similar statutes dating back to Edward III. These statutes set wages for certain tasks and provided a good record of the change in wage levels. Vaughan reasoned that the market for basic labor did not fluctuate much with time and that a basic laborer's salary would probably buy the same amount of goods in different time periods, so that a laborer's salary acted as a basket of goods. Vaughan's analysis indicated that price levels in England had risen six- to eight-fold over the preceding century.Chance, 108. William Fleetwood While Vaughan can be considered a forerunner of price index research, his analysis did not actually involve calculating an index. In 1707, Englishman William Fleetwood created perhaps the first true price index. An Oxford student asked Fleetwood to help show how prices had changed. The student stood to lose his fellowship since a 15th- century stipulation barred students with annual incomes over five pounds from receiving a fellowship. Fleetwood, who already had an interest in price change, had collected a large amount of price data going back hundreds of years. Fleetwood proposed an index consisting of averaged price relatives and used his methods to show that the value of five pounds had changed greatly over the course of 260 years. He argued on behalf of the Oxford students and published his findings anonymously in a volume entitled Chronicon Preciosum.Chance, 108‚Äì9  Formal calculation  Given a set C of goods and services, the total market value of transactions in C in some period t would be :\\\\sum_{c\\\\,\\\\in\\\\, C} (p_{c,t}\\\\cdot q_{c,t}) where :p_{c,t}\\\\, represents the prevailing price of c in period t :q_{c,t}\\\\, represents the quantity of c sold in period t If, across two periods t_0 and t_n, the same quantities of each good or service were sold, but under different prices, then :q_{c,t_n}=q_c=q_{c,t_0}\\\\, \\\\forall c and :P=\\\\frac{\\\\sum (p_{c,t_n}\\\\cdot q_c)}{\\\\sum (p_{c,t_0}\\\\cdot q_c)} would be a reasonable measure of the price of the set in one period relative to that in the other, and would provide an index measuring relative prices overall, weighted by quantities sold. Of course, for any practical purpose, quantities purchased are rarely if ever identical across any two periods. As such, this is not a very practical index formula. One might be tempted to modify the formula slightly to :P=\\\\frac{\\\\sum (p_{c,t_n}\\\\cdot q_{c,t_n})}{\\\\sum (p_{c,t_0}\\\\cdot q_{c,t_0})} This new index, however, does not do anything to distinguish growth or reduction in quantities sold from price changes. To see that this is so, consider what happens if all the prices double between t_0 and t_n, while quantities stay the same: P will double. Now consider what happens if all the quantities double between t_0 and t_n while all the prices stay the same: P will double. In either case, the change in P is identical. As such, P is as much a quantity index as it is a price index. Various indices have been constructed in an attempt to compensate for this difficulty.  Paasche and Laspeyres price indices  The two most basic formulae used to calculate price indices are the Paasche index (after the economist Hermann Paasche ) and the Laspeyres index (after the economist Etienne Laspeyres ). The Paasche index is computed as :P_P=\\\\frac{\\\\sum (p_{c,t_n}\\\\cdot q_{c,t_n})}{\\\\sum (p_{c,t_0}\\\\cdot q_{c,t_n})} while the Laspeyres index is computed as :P_L=\\\\frac{\\\\sum (p_{c,t_n}\\\\cdot q_{c,t_0})}{\\\\sum (p_{c,t_0}\\\\cdot q_{c,t_0})} where P is the relative index of the price levels in two periods, t_0 is the base period (usually the first year), and t_n the period for which the index is computed. Note that the only difference in the formulas is that the former uses period n quantities, whereas the latter uses base period (period 0) quantities. A helpful mnemonic device to remember which index uses which period is that L comes before P in the alphabet so the Laspeyres index uses the earlier base quantities and the Paasche index the final quantities. When applied to bundles of individual consumers, a Laspeyres index of 1 would state that an agent in the current period can afford to buy the same bundle as she consumed in the previous period, given that income has not changed; a Paasche index of 1 would state that an agent could have consumed the same bundle in the base period as she is consuming in the current period, given that income has not changed. Hence, one may think of the Paasche index as one where the numeraire is the bundle of goods using current year prices and current year quantities. Similarly, the Laspeyres index can be thought of as a price index taking the bundle of goods using current prices and base period quantities as the numeraire. The Laspeyres index tends to overstate inflation (in a cost of living framework), while the Paasche index tends to understate it, because the indices do not account for the fact that consumers typically react to price changes by changing the quantities that they buy. For example, if prices go up for good c then, ceteris paribus, quantities demanded of that good should go down.  Lowe indices  Many price indices are calculated with the Lowe index procedure. In a Lowe price index, the expenditure or quantity weights associated with each item are not drawn from each indexed period. Usually they are inherited from an earlier period, which is sometimes called the expenditure base period. Generally the expenditure weights are updated occasionally, but the prices are updated in every period. Prices are drawn from the time period the index is supposed to summarize.\\"Peter Hill. 2010. \\"Lowe Indices\\", chapter 9, pp. 197-216 in W.E. Diewert, B.M. Balk, D. Fixler, K.J. Fox, and A.O.

Jahrb√ºcher f√ºr National√∂konomie und Statistik / Journal of Economics and Statistics. 230:6, Themenheft: Index Number Theory and Price Statistics (Dec. 2010), pp. 726-740 Lowe indexes are sometimes called a \\"modified Laspeyres index\\", where the principal modification is to draw quantity weights less frequently than every period. For a consumer price index, the weights on various kinds of expenditure are generally computed from surveys of households asking about their budgets, and such surveys are less frequent than price data collection is. Another phrasings is that Laspeyres and Paasche indexes are special cases of Lowe indexes in which all price and quantity data are updated every period. Comparisons of output between countries often use Lowe quantity indexes. The Geary-Khamis method used in the World Bank's International Comparison Program is of this type. Here the quantity data are updated each period from each of multiple countries, whereas the prices incorporated are kept the same for some period of time, e.g. the \\"average prices for the group of countries\\".  Fisher index and Marshall‚ÄìEdgeworth index  The Marshall‚ÄìEdgeworth index (named for economists Alfred Marshall and Francis Ysidro Edgeworth), tries to overcome the problems of under- and overstatement by the Laspeyres and Paasche indexes by using the arithmetic means of the quantities: :P_{ME}=\\\\frac{\\\\sum [p_{c,t_n}\\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\cdot(q_{c,t_0}+q_{c,t_n})]}{\\\\sum [p_{c,t_0}\\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\cdot(q_{c,t_0}+q_{c,t_n})]}=\\\\frac{\\\\sum [p_{c,t_n}\\\\cdot (q_{c,t_0}+q_{c,t_n})]}{\\\\sum [p_{c,t_0}\\\\cdot (q_{c,t_0}+q_{c,t_n})]} The Fisher index, named for economist Irving Fisher), also known as the Fisher ideal index, is calculated as the geometric mean of P_P and P_L: :P_F = \\\\sqrt{P_P\\\\cdot P_L} All these indices provide some overall measurement of relative prices between time periods or locations.  Practical measurement considerations  Normalizing index numbers = Price indices are represented as index numbers, number values that indicate relative change but not absolute values (i.e. one price index value can be compared to another or a base, but the number alone has no meaning). Price indices generally select a base year and make that index value equal to 100. Every other year is expressed as a percentage of that base year. In this example, let 2000 be the base year: * 2000: original index value was $2.50; $2.50/$2.50 = 100%, so new index value is 100 * 2001: original index value was $2.60; $2.60/$2.50 = 104%, so new index value is 104 * 2002: original index value was $2.70; $2.70/$2.50 = 108%, so new index value is 108 * 2003: original index value was $2.80; $2.80/$2.50 = 112%, so new index value is 112 When an index has been normalized in this manner, the meaning of the number 112, for instance, is that the total cost for the basket of goods is 4% more in 2001 than in the base year (in this case, year 2000), 8% more in 2002, and 12% more in 2003. = Relative ease of calculating the Laspeyres index = As can be seen from the definitions above, if one already has price and quantity data (or, alternatively, price and expenditure data) for the base period, then calculating the Laspeyres index for a new period requires only new price data. In contrast, calculating many other indices (e.g., the Paasche index) for a new period requires both new price data and new quantity data (or alternatively, both new price data and new expenditure data) for each new period. Collecting only new price data is often easier than collecting both new price data and new quantity data, so calculating the Laspeyres index for a new period tends to require less time and effort than calculating these other indices for a new period.Statistics New Zealand; Glossary of Common Terms, \\"Paasche Index\\" In practice, price indices regularly compiled and released by national statistical agencies are of the Laspeyres type, due to the above- mentioned difficulties in obtaining current-period quantity or expenditure data. = Calculating indices from expenditure data = Sometimes, especially for aggregate data, expenditure data are more readily available than quantity data.Statistics New Zealand; Glossary of Common Terms, \\"Laspeyres Index\\" For these cases, the indices can be formulated in terms of relative prices and base year expenditures, rather than quantities. Here is a reformulation for the Laspeyres index: Let E_{c,t_0} be the total expenditure on good c in the base period, then (by definition) we have E_{c,t_0} = p_{c,t_0}\\\\cdot q_{c,t_0} and therefore also \\\\frac{E_{c,t_0}}{p_{c,t_0}} = q_{c,t_0}. We can substitute these values into our Laspeyres formula as follows: : P_L =\\\\frac{\\\\sum (p_{c,t_n}\\\\cdot q_{c,t_0})}{\\\\sum (p_{c,t_0}\\\\cdot q_{c,t_0})} =\\\\frac{\\\\sum (p_{c,t_n}\\\\cdot \\\\frac{E_{c,t_0}}{p_{c,t_0}})}{\\\\sum E_{c,t_0}} =\\\\frac{\\\\sum (\\\\frac{p_{c,t_n}}{p_{c,t_0}} \\\\cdot E_{c,t_0})}{\\\\sum E_{c,t_0}} A similar transformation can be made for any index.  Chained vs unchained calculations  The above price indices were calculated relative to a fixed base period. An alternative is to take the base period for each time period to be the immediately preceding time period. This can be done with any of the above indices. Here is an example with the Laspeyres index, where t_n is the period for which we wish to calculate the index and t_0 is a reference period that anchors the value of the series: : P_{t_n}= \\\\frac{\\\\sum (p_{c,t_1}\\\\cdot q_{c,t_0})}{\\\\sum (p_{c,t_0}\\\\cdot q_{c,t_0})} \\\\times \\\\frac{\\\\sum (p_{c,t_2}\\\\cdot q_{c,t_1})}{\\\\sum (p_{c,t_1}\\\\cdot q_{c,t_1})} \\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times \\\\frac{\\\\sum (p_{c,t_n}\\\\cdot q_{c,t_{n-1}})}{\\\\sum (p_{c,t_{n-1}}\\\\cdot q_{c,t_{n-1}})} Each term :\\\\frac{\\\\sum (p_{c,t_n}\\\\cdot q_{c,t_{n-1}})}{\\\\sum (p_{c,t_{n-1}}\\\\cdot q_{c,t_{n-1}})} answers the question \\"by what factor have prices increased between period t_{n-1} and period t_n\\". These are multiplied together to answer the question \\"by what factor have prices increased since period t_0\\". The index is then the result of these multiplications, and gives the price relative to period t_0 prices. Chaining is defined for a quantity index just as it is for a price index.  Index number theory  Price index formulas can be evaluated based on their relation to economic concepts (like cost of living) or on their mathematical properties. Several different tests of such properties have been proposed in index number theory literature. W.E. Diewert summarized past research in a list of nine such tests for a price index I(P_{t_0}, P_{t_m}, Q_{t_0}, Q_{t_m}), where P_{t_0} and P_{t_m} are vectors giving prices for a base period and a reference period while Q_{t_0} and Q_{t_m} give quantities for these periods.Diewert (1993), 75-76. # Identity test: #: I(p_{t_m},p_{t_n},\\\\alpha \\\\cdot q_{t_m},\\\\beta\\\\cdot q_{t_n})=1~~\\\\forall (\\\\alpha ,\\\\beta )\\\\in (0,\\\\infty )^2 #: The identity test basically means that if prices remain the same and quantities remain in the same proportion to each other (each quantity of an item is multiplied by the same factor of either \\\\alpha, for the first period, or \\\\beta, for the later period) then the index value will be one. # Proportionality test: #: I(p_{t_m},\\\\alpha \\\\cdot p_{t_n},q_{t_m},q_{t_n})=\\\\alpha \\\\cdot I(p_{t_m},p_{t_n},q_{t_m},q_{t_n}) #: If each price in the original period increases by a factor Œ± then the index should increase by the factor Œ±. # Invariance to changes in scale test: #: I(\\\\alpha \\\\cdot p_{t_m},\\\\alpha \\\\cdot p_{t_n},\\\\beta \\\\cdot q_{t_m}, \\\\gamma \\\\cdot q_{t_n})=I(p_{t_m},p_{t_n},q_{t_m},q_{t_n})~~\\\\forall (\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma)\\\\in(0,\\\\infty )^3 #: The price index should not change if the prices in both periods are increased by a factor and the quantities in both periods are increased by another factor. In other words, the magnitude of the values of quantities and prices should not affect the price index. # Commensurability test: #: The index should not be affected by the choice of units used to measure prices and quantities. # Symmetric treatment of time (or, in parity measures, symmetric treatment of place): #: I(p_{t_n},p_{t_m},q_{t_n},q_{t_m})=\\\\frac{1}{I(p_{t_m},p_{t_n},q_{t_m},q_{t_n})} #: Reversing the order of the time periods should produce a reciprocal index value. If the index is calculated from the most recent time period to the earlier time period, it should be the reciprocal of the index found going from the earlier period to the more recent. # Symmetric treatment of commodities: #: All commodities should have a symmetric effect on the index. Different permutations of the same set of vectors should not change the index. # Monotonicity test: #: I(p_{t_m},p_{t_n},q_{t_m},q_{t_n}) \\\\le I(p_{t_m},p_{t_r},q_{t_m},q_{t_r})~~\\\\Leftarrow~~p_{t_n} \\\\le p_{t_r} #: A price index for lower later prices should be lower than a price index with higher later period prices. # Mean value test: #: The overall price relative implied by the price index should be between the smallest and largest price relatives for all commodities. # Circularity test: #: I(p_{t_m},p_{t_n},q_{t_m},q_{t_n}) \\\\cdot I(p_{t_n},p_{t_r},q_{t_n},q_{t_r})=I(p_{t_m},p_{t_r},q_{t_m},q_{t_r})~~\\\\Leftarrow~~t_m \\\\le t_n \\\\le t_r #: Given three ordered periods t_m, t_n, t_r, the price index for periods t_m and t_n times the price index for periods t_n and t_r should be equivalent to the price index for periods t_m and t_r.  Quality change  Price indices often capture changes in price and quantities for goods and services, but they often fail to account for variation in the quality of goods and services. This could be overcome if the principal method for relating price and quality, namely hedonic regression, could be reversed.Commercial Knowledge Delivers This Then quality change could be calculated from price. Instead, statistical agencies generally use matched-model price indices, where one model of a particular good is priced at the same store at regular time intervals. The matched-model method becomes problematic when statistical agencies try to use this method on goods and services with rapid turnover in quality features. For instance, computers rapidly improve and a specific model may quickly become obsolete. Statisticians constructing matched-model price indices must decide how to compare the price of the obsolete item originally used in the index with the new and improved item that replaces it. Statistical agencies use several different methods to make such price comparisons.Triplett (2004), 12. The problem discussed above can be represented as attempting to bridge the gap between the price for the old item at time t, P(M)_{t}, with the price of the new item at the later time period, P(N)_{t+1}.Triplett (2004), 18. * The overlap method uses prices collected for both items in both time periods, t and t+1. The price relative {P(N)_{t+1}}/{P(N)_{t}} is used. * The direct comparison method assumes that the difference in the price of the two items is not due to quality change, so the entire price difference is used in the index. P(N)_{t+1}/P(M)_t is used as the price relative. * The link-to- show-no-change assumes the opposite of the direct comparison method; it assumes that the entire difference between the two items is due to the change in quality. The price relative based on link-to-show-no-change is 1.Triplett (2004), 34. * The deletion method simply leaves the price relative for the changing item out of the price index. This is equivalent to using the average of other price relatives in the index as the price relative for the changing item. Similarly, class mean imputation uses the average price relative for items with similar characteristics (physical, geographic, economic, etc.) to M and N.Triplett (2004), 24‚Äì6.

He is a monstrously obese, rude restaurant patron who is served a vast amount of food and alcohol whilst vomiting repeatedly. After being persuaded to eat an after-dinner mint ‚Äì \\"It's only wafer-thin\\" ‚Äì he explodes in a very graphic way. The sequence opens the film's segment titled \\"Part VI: The Autumn Years\\". The character is played by Terry Jones, who directed the film. According to Jones, John Cleese, who played the Ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel, struggled to keep a straight face saying \\"wafer-thin mint\\" and also struggled to get out of shot without bursting into laughter. Synopsis In the sequence, Mr. Creosote dines at a French restaurant. The entrance of this morbidly obese middle-aged man is accompanied by ominous music. One of the fish in the aquarium exclaims \\"Oh shit‚Äîit's Mr. Creosote!\\" as he passes, causing all the fish to swim for cover. The scene opens with a short dialogue between Mr. Creosote (who speaks with a coarse accent) and the ma√Ætre d' (who speaks with a fake exaggerated French accent), played by John Cleese: *Ma√Ætre d': \\"Ah, good afternoon, sir; and how are we today?\\" *Mr. Creosote: \\"Better.\\" *Ma√Ætre d': \\"Better?\\" *Mr. Creosote: \\"Better get a bucket, I'm gonna throw up.\\" Creosote is then led to his table, and once seated starts projectile- vomiting, generally failing to hit the provided bucket. The floor quickly becomes covered in , and so do the cleaning woman and the ma√Ætre d's trousers. Creosote listens patiently while the menu's highlights are read out to him by the ma√Ætre d', and after vomiting on the menu held open in front of him, he orders : *Mr. Creosote: \\"I'll have the lot.\\" *Ma√Ætre d': \\"A wise choice monsieur!\\" He is served moules marini√®res, p√¢t√© de foie gras, beluga caviar, Eggs Benedict, a leek tart, frogs' legs amandine and quail's eggs with pur√©ed mushrooms all mixed in a bucket with the quail eggs on top and a double helping of p√¢t√©. The appetizers are followed by the main course of jugged hare, with a sauce of truffles, bacon, Grand Marnier, anchovies and cream. For drinks, Mr. Creosote has six bottles of Ch√¢teau Latour 1945, a Methuselah (Double Jeroboam/6 litres) of champagne, and half a dozen crates of brown ale (144 bottles)‚Äîconsiderably less than his usual fare. *Ma√Ætre d': Bon, and the usual brown ales ...? *Mr. Creosote: Yeah‚Ä¶ No wait a minute ... I think I can only manage six crates today. He finishes the feast, and several other courses, vomiting profusely all over himself, his table, and the restaurant's staff throughout his meal, causing other diners to lose their appetite, and in some cases, throw up as well. The audience, however, never sees Creosote eating, with the sole exception of him seemingly chewing on a whole pineapple towards the end of the sequence. Finally, after being persuaded by the smooth ma√Ætre d' to eat a single \\"wafer-thin mint\\", his stomach begins to rapidly expand until it explodes: covering the restaurant and diners with viscera and partially digested food‚Äîeven starting a \\"vomit-wave\\" among the other diners, who leave in disgust. When the explosion clears, Creosote is amazingly still alive, but his chest cavity and abdomen are now blasted open, revealing his spread ribs and intact, still-beating heart, and viscera. As he looks around, seemingly confused by what has just happened, the ma√Ætre d' calmly walks up to him and presents, \\"monsieur, the check\\". Production In the documentary The Meaning of Making 'The Meaning of Life (2003), John Cleese said that the sequence, originally written by Jones and Michael Palin, was initially rejected. Cleese said the initial version suffered from a flawed construction and rewrote it with Graham Chapman. At the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival ‚Äî Tribute to Monty Python it was claimed Cleese was taken with the unflappable ma√Ætre d' character. Jones thought Creosote should be played by fellow Python Terry Gilliam, before Gilliam persuaded Jones to play the role instead. Jones was transformed into Mr. Creosote by British prosthetic make-up artist Christopher Tucker, who also created the prosthetic effects for the American film drama The Elephant Man (1980). The was portrayed using large amounts of condensed minestrone soup. This made a considerable mess of the filming location, the Porchester centre in Bayswater, west London. Reception When asked about his proclivity toward gruesome film violence, director Quentin Tarantino said that the \\"Mr. Creosote\\" scene was the only time he had been disturbed by a graphic or gruesome film sequence. George Harrison of The Beatles and who co- founded production company Handmade Films to fund the making of Monty Python and the Holy Grail and other later projects by Python members, noted the similarity between the Mr Creosote episode and the scene in Magical Mystery Tour where John Lennon, dressed as a waiter, serves pasta to Ringo‚Äôs fictional Aunt Jessie using a spade to build a giant mound of spaghetti on the table. https://theconversation.com/magical-mystery-tour-a-rare-beatles-flop-but-it- paved-the-way-for-monty-python-87547 In his 2015 Movie Guide, Leonard Maltin described Mr. Creosote as having \\"an unforgettable scene, like it or not\\".

J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. History The first American version of Capri was introduced in 1956 by Lee Brothers Tobacco, as \\"Capri Rainbows\\", a high-end brand with different- coloured cigarette papers. At a later point, the Capri trademark was acquired by Brown & Williamson, who first made Capri as a regular-gauge menthol cigarette. The brand was relaunched in 1987 as the world's first superslim cigarette, and to compete with other slim cigarettes which were marketed towards women at the time, such as Virginia Slims. Susan Cameron was one of the people who oversaw the re-launch of the brand at the time. When Brown & Williamson merged with R.J. Reynolds in 2004, a new company called Reynolds American was formed, and the company manufactures the brand to this day. The cigarette has a slim shape, at 17 mm in circumference and 100 mm in length, specifically marketed towards women. By comparison, standard cigarettes are 25 mm in circumference, and slim cigarettes are 23 mm in circumference. Capri is available in regular and menthol light varieties, as well as regular and menthol ultra-light varieties. Capri is also available in a 120 mm length, which the packaging describes as \\"luxury length.\\" Advertising Before the introduction of the modern-day Capri brand, a few TV advertisements were made in the 1960s to promote a brand under the similar name. The brand was menthol- only and emphasised that, out of the smokers that were tested, Capri was preferred. Its slogan was \\"Menthol, but with a soft, fresh taste.\\" Various poster adverts were also made to promote the brand, especially towards young women. Advertisements for Capri follow the logic that slimmer is better, apparently influenced by the assumption that women prefer to be physically slim, since a slender figure is often presented as more desirable in women‚Äôs fashion magazines and by models in the fashion industry. Slogans such as \\"The slimmest slim in town\\" (1988) and \\"There is no slimmer way to smoke\\" (1994) provided a not-so-subliminal message that by smoking Capri cigarettes, consumers could count on obtaining or maintaining a slimmer figure than everyone else. In 2000, it was reported that advertising for Capri, which was managed by \\"Bates Advertising\\" would be transferred to Grey Global Group. Grey also managed advertising for Carlton, Pall Mall, GPC and Misty brands. Additionally, Grey would remain B&W;'s agency-of- record. Bates would maintain account responsibilities for Kool and Lucky Strike brands. Controversy=Italian Isle of Capri sues Brown & Williamson In May 1989, the Italian island of Capri sued Brown & Williamson for using the name on their ultra-slim cigarette brand. A lawsuit that the island filed against the Louisville-based tobacco company went to trial in Rome on June 30, 1989. Capri officials say they do not want their paradise associated with a potentially harmful product, and Brown & Williamson has no right to market a cigarette in Italy if Capri vetoes the plan. The manufacturer has contended that the action is groundless because the company has complied with \\"all applicable laws in securing rights to use the Capri name in Italy and in other countries where the brand is sold,\\" said company spokeswoman Valeris Oates. Oates said the company obtained necessary approvals from Italian trademark officials and the nationally owned cigarette distribution system. Browns & Williamson sells Capri in 60 countries, including the United States, where it went into national distribution in 1987. Billed as the \\"slimmest ultra-slim,\\" the cigarette is aimed at women. Brown & Williamson putting higher nicotine levels in Capri cigarettes In 1995, there was further controversy when in 1995 the former B&W; vice president and chemical researcher Jeffrey Wigand defected from the company. Wigand revealed the company‚Äôs secrets, saying that they had been adding unreported chemicals to the cigarettes. The Kool, Capri, and Viceroy cigarettes had increased nicotine levels to promote higher addiction factors, therefore promoting sales. Markets Capri is mainly sold in the United States, but also was or still is sold in Mexico, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Costa Rica, Brazil, West Germany, Germany (where the brand is known as \\"Caprice\\" due to a trademark issue), Switzerland, Italy, Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, Israel, Hong Kong and Japan.

Taylor was an early bassist for the Rolling Stones, but left the band to resume his studies at Sidcup Art College. While there he formed the Pretty Things in September 1963. He now lives on the Isle of Wight, England. Career Taylor was born in Livingstone Hospital, Dartford, and attended Dartford Grammar School. In July 1962, while he was at Sidcup Art College, the Rolling Stones was formed when Taylor, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards' three-piece group Little Boy Blue and the Blue Boys joined Brian Jones and Ian Stewart's Rollin' Stones. Initially, Taylor played lead guitar in the band, but switched to bass to accommodate Jones, who quickly went on to become an accomplished slide guitarist. That November, Taylor left to return to art college, and his former bandmates posted an advertisement seeking another bassist. Bill Wyman responded, and succeeded him as the Rolling Stones' bassist in December 1962. In 1963, Taylor formed the Pretty Things with vocalist Phil May, and once again played his preferred guitar position. He left the Pretty Things in 1969, after the release of their concept album S.F. Sorrow. The band released a few more albums without Taylor and disbanded in 1976, but regrouped with Taylor in 1979 to release Cross Talk. Taylor remained with the Pretty Things until they broke up in 2018. In addition to his work with The Pretty Things, Taylor co- produced Hawkwind's debut album, on which he also played guitar, as well as Cochise's first album and Skin Alley's first album. His contribution to punk rock was a recording by Auntie Pus. During the second half of the 1980s, Taylor played guitar with the English post-punk band the Mekons.

A Fixture Unit is not a flow rate unit but a design factor. A fixture unit is equal to one cubic foot of water drained in an 1 1/4 pipe over one minute Available at: https://mycomfortheroes.com/expert-tips/what-is-dfu- drainage-fixture-unit/ [Accessed March 14, 2020]. One cubic foot of water is roughly 7.48 gallons ( 6.25 Imperial Gallons). A Fixture Unit is used in plumbing design for both water supply and waste water. Different fixtures have different flow requirements. In order to determine the required size of pipe, an arbitrary unit is used for pipe sizing which takes into account the likelihood that all the fixtures will not be used at the same time. This is called \\"fixture unit\\" (FU). The relationship between gallons per minute (gpm) and fixture unit is not constant, but varies with the number of fixture units. For example, 1000 FU is equivalent to 220 gpm, but 2000 FU is not double that, but is only 1.5 times as much, or 330 gpm. Fixture unit values can be determined using charts from the International Plumbing Code or similar codes in local jurisdictions. There are situations where a design provides for more FUs being discharged than being supplied. This occurs in situations where liquids may infiltrate or are added to a draining system, such as might happen in a large sports venue. Examples of how this could occur include rain water infiltration.

The medal recognizes the leadership of Admiral of the Navy George Dewey, during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, and the Sailors and Marines under his command. Criteria The Dewey Medal was created to recognize the forces of the U.S. Navy and United States Marine Corps who participated in the Battle of Manila Bay. To be awarded the Dewey Medal, a service member must have served on one of the following naval vessels on May 1, 1898:  USRC McCulloch The colliers and were part of Dewey's squadron and supported the Manila Bay operation but are not listed in Navy regulations having their crew members eligible for the Dewey Medal. Navy and Marine Corps Awards Manual (1953 revision). pg. 36. This is probably because 1. the ships were not actively engaged in the battle and 2. they were, at that time, civilian manned ships purchased to support the Navy. Nanshan was commanded by Lieutenant Benjamin W. Hodges, USN but technically remained a merchant ship so she could resupply at neutral ports which simplified the squadron's logistics. Zafiro was commanded by Ensign Henry A. Pearson, USN and, like Nanshan, was technically a merchant ship at the time of the battle. Both ships were later commissioned in the Navy. The Dewey Medal was a one-time only decoration and there were no devices or campaign stars authorized to the medal. The medal consists of a circular medallion, upon which rests an image of Admiral George Dewey, suspended from a blue and yellow ribbon. Admiral Dewey was awarded the medal, although, out of modesty, he always wore it with the medal's reverse displayed which depicted a sailor sitting on a gun. Dewey had the rare distinction of being one of only four Americans entitled to wear a medal with their own image on it. The others were Rear Admiral William T. Sampson (Sampson Medal), Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd (1st and 2nd Byrd Antarctic Expedition Medals) and General of the Armies John J. Pershing (Army of Occupation of Germany Medal). The medal was recognized as being given for active military duty; yet because it recognized a single battle in a single campaign, the Dewey Medal was a commemorative medal. When worn on a military uniform the Dewey Medal was considered senior to the Sampson Medal, although there were no individuals who received both medals. The Dewey Medal is one of a very few United States military awards to have fewer recipients than the Medal of Honor. Appearance This medal was designed by celebrated artist Daniel Chester French, who sculpted the statue of a seated Lincoln in Washington's Lincoln Memorial and the Minuteman statue at Concord, Mass. The medal was struck by Tiffany & Co. The front, or obverse, depicts a bust of Commodore George Dewey. On the back, or reverse, is included the name of the vessel on which the recipient served. The name of the recipient is engraved on the medal's lower rim, this being one of only two service medals issued officially named to the recipient.

As Confederate Lieutenant General Richard S. Ewell moved down the Shenandoah Valley in the direction of Pennsylvania, his corps defeated the Union Army garrison commanded by Major General Robert H. Milroy, capturing Winchester and numerous Union prisoners.  Background  After the Battle of Brandy Station on June 9, 1863, Confederate General Robert E. Lee ordered Ewell's 19,000-man Second Corps, Army of Northern Virginia, to clear the lower Shenandoah Valley of Union opposition so that Lee's army could proceed on its invasion of Pennsylvania, shielded by the Blue Ridge Mountains from Union interference. Union General- in-chief Henry Wager Halleck expressed great concerns about the Middle Department's defensive strategy for its primary objective of protecting the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad corridor.Grunder & Beck, p. 8. Brig. Gen. Benjamin Franklin Kelley, commander of the \\"railroad division\\" (Department of Harper's Ferry), had been advised that his plan along with Maj. Gen. Milroy's and Maj. Gen. Robert C. Schenck's (Commander of the Middle Department) was unsound:  Opposing forces =Ewell's Second Corps, Army of Northern Virginia Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell's force of 19,000 consisted of: * The division of Maj. Gen. Jubal A. Early, with the brigades of Brig. Gens. Harry T. Hays (Louisiana Tigers), William \\"Extra Billy\\" Smith, John B. Gordon, and Isaac E. Avery * The division of Maj. Gen. Robert E. Rodes, with the brigades of Brig. Gens. Junius Daniel, George P. Doles, Alfred Iverson, Stephen Dodson Ramseur, and Col. Edward A. O'Neal * The division of Maj. Gen. Edward \\"Allegheny\\" Johnson, with the brigades of Brig. Gens. George H. Steuart, James A. Walker (Stonewall Brigade), John M. Jones, and Col. Jesse M. Williams (Nicholls' Brigade) * The unattached 1st Maryland Battalion * The cavalry brigade of Brig. Gen. Albert G. Jenkins * Corps Artillery Reserve under Col. J. Thompson Brown 2nd Division, VIII Corps, Middle Department Maj. Gen. Robert H. Milroy's force of 6,900 consisted of three infantry brigades, under Brig. Gen. Washington L. Elliot and Cols. Andrew T. McReynolds and William G. Ely, and two small outposts northwest of town under Col. Joseph W. Keifer.  Preliminary maneuvers =Army of Northern Virginia (A.N.Va.) movement Ewell's movements were coordinated as part of an overall orchestration of the Army of Northern Virginia into position for crossing the Potomac River toward Pennsylvania by using the Blue Ridge Mountains as a screen. This strategic offensive maneuver was put into effect on 3 June, when Gen. Robert E. Lee stated his intent to \\"transfer the scene of hostilities beyond the Potomac\\", by moving in a concealed fashion down the Shenandoah Valley. Longstreet's First Corps (via Snickers Gap) and Hill's Third Corps (via Ashby's Gap) paralleled the movements of Second Corps to the east through Berryville, Virginia, and Stuart's Cavalry Division was under orders for careful synchronization and screening for Lee's Army by conducting demonstrations and screening actions along the ANV's right flank east of the Blue Ridge. =Ewell's Second Corps movements= ;June 4‚Äì11 : The Second Corps left Hamilton's Crossing on 4 June and marched to Culpeper, Virginia, arriving 7 June. Receiving intelligence that Union forces had crossed the Rappahannock River in force, Lee ordered Ewell northeast to Brandy Station, Virginia, on 9 June, to support Major General J.E.B. Stuart's actions in the Battle of Brandy Station, only to find the Union forces already retreating. Ewell resumed the march on 10 June, and on 11 June Early and Johnson's Divisions marched via the Sperryville turnpike to Gaines crossroads, while Rodes' Division took the Richmond road toward Flint Hill.Hotchkiss, p. 150. On the evening of the 11th, after consulting with General Lee, Ewell met with Early, Johnson and the Second Corps topographer, Jedediah Hotchkiss, to discuss approach routes, and a general plan for the Second Corps' objective to capture Winchester and Martinsburg. ;June 12 : The Second Corps passed through Chester's Gap southeast of Front Royal, Virginia, approaching along the Front Royal Pike (modern U.S. 522). There the Second Corps was joined by its cavalry brigade under the command of Brig. Gen. Albert G. Jenkins. Ewell consulted with Early and Jenkins to form his corps-level plan of action, composed of splitting the corps into two basic independent movements:Hotchkiss, p. 151. * North intercept & cut-off maneuver to Berryville & Martinsburg: ** Units: Rodes' Division and Jenkins' cavalry brigade ** Direction of movement: detached north through Berryville, Virginia to Martinsburg, West Virginia ** Ewell's objective: To capture, if possible, McReynolds' force of 1,800 men stationed at Berryville and then to press north to Martinsburg * Main strike maneuver to Winchester: ** Units: Early's Division, Johnson's Division and the 16th Virginia Cavalry Battalion (Maj. James H. Nounnan) of Jenkins' Brigade ** Direction of movement: Northwest to Winchester, Virginia ** Ewell's objective: To attack the fortifications in Winchester and Milroy's force of 6,000 to 8,000 men By the end of the day on 12 June, Rodes' Division was north of Front Royal, encamped at Stone Bridge, while Johnson's Division arrived at Cedarville, and Early's Division was encamped near the Shenandoah River. Milroy's defensive preparationsBerryville outpost= By April, four months into his occupation of Winchester, Milroy's loose grip on Confederate raiding in the lower Shenandoah Valley caused enough concern for the Middle Department commander, Schenck, to directly order Milroy to post one brigade further to the east at Berryville. It offered a base of operations to patrol crossings of the Shenandoah River and lookout for Confederates raiding in and out of both Snicker's Gap and Ashby's Gap in the Blue Ridge Mountains on the eastern border of the valley.Maier, p. 81. In response, Milroy posted McReynolds' brigade in Berryville, with orders to evacuate to Winchester upon the signal of the firing of one of the heavy artillery guns. =Cavalry defenses= Milroy stationed pickets and videttes around Winchester, but they were positioned too close to Winchester, due to bushwacking of his patrols.Maier, p. 67. Therefore, Milroy had practically no surveillance of the situation around himself. His caution in posting outlying videttes was also perhaps due to the severe losses he incurred in trying to suppress various Confederate cavalry raids that kept occurring in his district, such as on 26 February, when he sent the 1st New York Cavalry and the 13th Pennsylvania Cavalry out to pursue raiders. They met the 7th and 11th Virginia Cavalry, under the command of Col. O. R. Funsten, and suffered a devastating loss of 197 Federal cavalry, including 12 officers.Maier, p. 80. Milroy also often recorded many other grand-sounding cavalry incursions supposedly capturing or killing many of Colonel John S. Mosby's rangers in the weeks and months leading up to June; however, the records of Mosby's Rangers do not corroborate or mention most of these engagementsMaier, p. 97. Milroy's farthest outlying videttes to the south were located at or near Parkins Mill Battery at the Opequon Creek crossing, a mere south of Winchester.Hotchkiss, p. 151 Other reports of Federal videttes to the west of Winchester were never seen or encountered by Confederate forces. =Fortifications= MajGen. Milroy's defensive fortifications in Winchester, Virginia, in June 1863 Winchester was heavily fortified by forts and lunettes circumferencing the town, as well as along the outlying turnpike routes entering town. Within Winchester, Milroy constructed or improved ten defensive fortifications, numbered Battery No. 1 through Battery No. 10, making improvements on many pre-existing forts and fortifications left by prior Confederate and Federal occupations. The fortifications were linked in places with roads and trenches, and the use of these were a key to Milroy's defensive strategy. Through a combination of retreating his forces into the defensive works, and then using his long-range heavy artillery, Milroy felt that he could hold out for weeks (if not months) against any force that may be thrown against him. During the battle, Milroy concentrated his forces on the ridges west of town in his three highest and most improved forts connected by trenches. The larger forts were named: * Battery No. 2 - Fort Milroy: Originally built by Confederate troops and called the \\"fortification on the heights\\" or the \\"Main Fort\\", this was improved under Maj. Gen. Banks and called \\"Fort Garibaldi\\" by the 39th New York regiment. The fort was improved extensively by Milroy's troops and held 14 guns, including heavy artillery, and renamed Fort Milroy (but then renamed Fort Jackson after the battle). * Battery No. 3 - Star Fort: This fort was built by Federal troops in 1862, improved by Milroy, and equipped with 8 guns. (Renamed Fort Alabama). * Battery No. 5 - West Fort: This was a 4-gun lunette located due west of Fort Milroy (later renamed Louisiana Heights) The lesser fortifications initially used, but abandoned by Milroy during the course of the battle were: * Battery No. 1: A linear entrenchment-lunette along Bower's Hill south of Fort Milroy (Battery 2). * Battery No. 4: A large star lunette with entrenchments and minor lunettes containing 6 guns, located due north of Star Fort (Battery 3) along the same ridge line (north of modern VA 37). * Battery No. 6: A small lunette with 2 guns on a hill peak located in between West Fort (Battery 5) and Battery 7 (modern exit of VA 37 onto VA 522). * Battery No. 7: A large lunette and trench line with 8 guns on Apple Pie Ridge west of Apple Pie Ridge Road (modern James Wood High School). * Battery No. 8: A grouping of two redans downhill west of Star Fort (Battery 3). * Battery No. 9: Unknown location. * Battery No. 10: this was the Confederate Fort Collier built on the east side of the Martinsburg turnpike on the north end of town. * Fortification at Opequon Crossing (Parkins Mill Battery): A lunette or redan 4 miles south of Winchester at the Opequon River crossing on the Front Royal turnpike (modern VA 522). For further information see:The Occupation of Major General Robert Milroy  Main battle =June 13: initial engagementsEwell's attack plan= Ewell and his generals were well acquainted with the tactical situation in Winchester, having fought through here under Lt. Gen. Jackson during the First Battle of Winchester, and understood the layout of the various fortifications and terrain masking opportunities on the west side of town. Therefore, Ewell further split his main attack force of two divisions into two basic flanking movements: * West (Left) Flanking Movement ** Units: Early's Division, Brown's artillery battalion, 1st Maryland Infantry Battalion and the Baltimore Light Artillery ** Direction: West to Newton, on the Valley Pike ** Ewell's objective: Approach Winchester from the southwest, and seek flanking avenues of approach from the west and northwest ridges of town * East (Right) Flanking Movement ** Units: Johnson's Division, 16th Virginia cavalry battalion ** Direction: Northwest to Winchester on the Front Royal Pike ** Ewell's objective: Perform demonstrations moving north along the east side of Winchester to \\"divert attention\\"Official Records, Series I, Volume XXVII/2 [S# 44] from Early's movements =Johnson's Division advances on the Front Royal Pike= Johnson's division, while moving northwest on the Front Royal Pike, drove back Federal pickets at the Opequon River crossing (Parkins Mill Battery) around 8:30 a.m., and engaged in cavalry skirmishes at Hoge Run around 9:30 a.m. Johnson's advance stalled under fire from Fort Milroy's heavy guns shortly before noon, and skirmishing and artillery engagements commended afterward with Federal artillery located on the hill near Hollinsworth Mill. Johnson held his position at that point to synchronize with the arrival of Early's Division. =Early's Division advances on the Valley Pike= Ewell ordered Early's Division to cross west via Ninevah to Newtown and move north on the Valley Pike. Arriving at the outskirts of Kernstown light infantry and artillery engagements commenced around noon. Late in the afternoon, around 4 p.m., Early pushed back Federal skirmishers at the Valley Pike toll-gate and after minor engagements, the Federal forces retreated north of Abrams Creek. =Milroy concentrates into his forts= Milroy, despite the engagements up to point, still had no idea that he was facing the entire Second Corps of Lee's Army. Milroy concentrated all of his forces in the three forts defending the town. Having feared exactly this type of a scenario, General-in-chief Henry W. Halleck had asked Schenck to order Milroy to fall back from Winchester to Harpers Ferry. Although Schenck had discussed evacuation with Milroy, he left no clear direction for Milroy to evacuate, since Milroy had convinced Schenck that his defensive position in Winchester was strong. Milroy had previously decided to disregard concerns from Washington because he was confident that the strength of his fortifications would allow his garrison to withstand an assault or a siege. =Rodes' Division advances on Berryville and Martinsburg= Ewell, based on good intelligence from sources in the lower Valley, had foreseen that Milroy's only escape route could be successfully blocked and had already anticipated by having Rodes' Division advance on Martinsburg via Berryville to cut off Milroy's expected retreat route, per his plans from 11 June. That afternoon, having reached Berryville, Rodes' Division and Jenkins' cavalry brigade attempted to capture McReynolds' Brigade, but, alerted to the Confederate movement by the firing of signal guns by Milroy's main force in Winchester, McReynolds withdrew to Winchester, where his force occupied the Star Fort north of town. Nevertheless, the Confederates were able to capture portions of the Federal supply train at nearby Bunker Hill, West Virginia, along with 75 prisoners. Subsequently, Confederate forces cut the telegram line into Winchester, eliminating Milroy's only line of communication, and by sundown on 13 June Rodes' Division had reached Martinsburg, capturing the town along with five Federal artillery pieces.Hotchkiss, p. 151-152 The night of 13 June a storm arose, and a strong rain drenched Winchester and the lower Valley all night long. June 14: Ewell's double-flank AttackEarly's left flanking march to Apple Pie Ridge= At dawn on June 14, Gordon's Brigade swept forward to capture Bower's Hill with little resistance. Johnson extended his line to the right against very light opposition. There was fitful skirmishing in the streets of Winchester. Early and Ewell conferred on Bower's Hill and decided on a flanking strategy. Gordon's Brigade and two batteries were left on Bower's Hill, while Early led his three other brigades back to Cedar Creek Grade, west beyond Apple Pie Ridge where it was out of view of Federal fortifications, then north over Cloverdale Plantation to Walnut Grove. His column was accompanied by 20 guns. While Early made this march, Johnson advanced a line of skirmishers on the right to occupy the Federals' attention, providing diversionary skirmishing all day from 10 a.m. until about 4 p.m. The Confederate batteries on Bower's Hill opened up, touching off a duel with the Federal guns in Fort Milroy. By mid-afternoon, Early's force had gained a position opposite West Fort on Apple Pie Ridge. Eight guns were positioned on the Brierly Farm northwest of the fort, while 12 guns were placed in an orchard southwest of the fort, but by this time the field had quieted. Within the Federal forts, Milroy and his sub-commanders believed that the Confederates had been repulsed from Winchester, still seemingly unaware they were now totally surrounded and cut off, with the additional problem of an entire division (Rodes') occupying their primary escape route north. =Early's attack on West Fort= About 6 p.m.,Hotchkiss, p. 152 Early's artillery opened fire on West Fort. The twenty guns fired for 45 minutes, while Hays stealthily advanced his Louisiana brigade through the corn and wheat fields at the base of Apple Pie Ridge. On command, the brigade rushed forward across 300 yards of open fields and swept upward into the works. After a brief hand-to-hand struggle, the Federal defenders abandoned the works, retreating to Fort Milroy, while their own captured artillery were turned around and used against them.Hotchkiss, p. 152. Hays was supported in the attack by Smith's and Avery's brigade, and Early consolidated his line on West Fort (or Flint) Ridge, but darkness prevented further gains. An artillery duel continued until long after dark. After the battle, Ewell christened West Fort Ridge as \\"Louisiana Heights\\" in honor of Hays's brigade. That evening, Ewell located his Corps Headquarters at the Bowers' House, while Early's Division pounded away at Milroy's main fort in an artillery duel well into the night. =Johnson's right flanking march toward Stephenson's Depot= Ewell assumed that Milroy might attempt a retreat during the night and ordered Johnson to prevent his escape by marching north and cutting off escape to the east-north- east via the Charles Town Road, a potential escape route that could possibly bypass the position of Rodes' Division in the north. Therefore, about 9 p.m., Johnson (with Steuart's and Williams's brigades and 8 guns) commenced a night march north to Berryville Pike and west to Jordan Springs Road, where he turned north toward Stephenson's Depot, a train stop on the Winchester and Potomac Railroad near the intersection of the Martinsburg Pike and the Charles Town Road. About midnight, the Stonewall Brigade disengaged and joined the rear of the column, leaving one brigade (Jones) astride the Berryville Pike east of town. =Milroy retreats up the Martinsburg Pike= Also at 9 p.m., at a formal council of war, Milroy and his officers made the decision to try to \\"cut their way through\\" to Harpers Ferry on the old Charles Town Road, the very same road that Confederate Johnson and his division were marching toward to cut off. All of the cannons were spiked and their carriages destroyed. Shortly after midnight, the Federal soldiers pulled their colors and left their works so quietly that Early's Confederates did not know they were gone until morning. The column massed in the low ground between Star Fort and Fort Milroy, then moved down along the railroad line and the Valley Pike toward the Charles Town crossroad, just south of Stephenson's Depot. June 15: Johnson's attack at Stephenson's Depot Near dawn on June 15, Johnson's skirmishers encountered the head of Milroy's retreating column near the intersection of the Valley Pike and old Charles Town road. Milroy faced his column to the right on the pike and prepared to fight his way out of a \\"murderous trap\\" by enveloping the enemy. Johnson deployed his regiments along Milburn Road as they came up and advanced to the railroad and placed two guns on either side of the Charles Town Road railroad bridge. The rest of the artillery was deployed on the heights east of Milburn Road. As it grew light, Federal forces made several desperate but uncoordinated attacks against the bridge and railroad embankment. The Confederates were being steadily reinforced and repulsed each attempt. Nicholl's Brigade crushed the final Federal attack and the Stonewall Brigade then came up in line of battle north of the road and advanced to cut the Valley Pike. This was the final blow; and some remaining Federal regiments hoisted the white flag. At some point Milroy's horse was shot out from under him, and the Division as a whole scattered in various directions to the northwest, north, and northeast, with some small groups even managing to escape covertly to the southeast toward and through Manassas Gap into Federally controlled territory.  Aftermath =Casualty reports Both Union and Confederate Official Record reports on casualties are practically identical. Ewell reported: *\\"The fruits of this victory were 23 pieces of artillery (nearly all rifled), 4,000 prisoners, 300 loaded wagons, more than 300 horses, and quite a large amount of commissary and quartermaster's stores.\\"Official Record, Series 1, Volume XXVII/2 [S# 44] This prisoner count seems to include the capture of all the Federal wounded hospitalized in Winchester, since Ewell's topographer, Jedediah Hotchkiss counts about 2,000 prisoners from the town, along with an estimate of about 1,500 that escaped to Harper's Ferry, along with more prisoners captured during pursuits from the Confederate cavalry. When Milroy appeared later in Harpers Ferry, he was immediately placed under arrest. Shortly after Schenck reported Milroy's arrest had expired, Aide-de-Camp Capt. Frederick A. Palmer, 18th Connecticut Infantry, reported in an extensive and detailed table of all units, summarized:Official Records, Series 1, Volume XXVII/2 p.53 *Killed: 7 Officers, 88 Enlisted men, Wounded: 12 Officers, 336 Enlisted men, Captured or missing: 144 Officers, 3856 Enlisted men. Thus, while Ewell reports 4,000 captured, the VIII Corps reports 144 Officers and 3856 Enlisted men missing or captured, which also adds to 4,000. Captain Palmer summarized the Union losses at a total of 4,443 for 1st, 2nd and 3rd Brigades from the 2nd Division, VIII Corps including all independent attachments. Johnson's Division, alone, captured 3,500 prisoners in the action at Stephenson's Depot, and this is not surprising, since this is the only major engagement of the war in which an entire Division column was attacked at night while route-marching on a road. General Johnson claimed to have taken 30 prisoners \\"with his opera glass!\\" as well as \\"11 stands of colors, 175 horses, and arms and accoutrements of every description\\".Grunder, Beck, Second Battle of Winchester, p. 52 Some casualty estimates range lower. Eicher writes that Confederate casualties were 269 (47 killed, 219 wounded, 3 missing); Union 3,801 (95 killed, 348 wounded, 3,358 missing or captured).Eicher, p. 494. Difficult to account for in the records are additional numbers of captured Union soldiers from the many hospitals in Winchester.NPS website: Union casualty figures for Second Winchester vary widely because about two thousand Union soldiers not belonging to Milroy's command were in field hospitals in the city and were often added to the number of captured and missing. The casualty ratio in this engagement of two divisions against one was an amazing 269 to 4,443 or 0.06 ... the most lopsided for an engagement of this size in the entire war. It's no wonder that Confederate artillerist Maj. Robert Stiles wrote, \\"This battle of Winchester ... was one of the most perfect pieces of work the Army of Northern Virginia ever did.\\" A division lost, two battalions gained Milroy and his staff, his cavalry, and other small units, totaling about 1,200 escaped to Harpers Ferry. Additionally, in the days following the battle \\"2,700 more turned up in Bloody Run, Pennsylvania\\".Grunder, Beck, Second Battle of Winchester, p. 63 Milroy's command ceased to exist, and the scattered remnants of what was the 2nd Division, VIII Corps were assimilated back into the Middle Department, while Milroy was placed under arrest. The Confederates had merely hoped to re- supply and forage, but with the easy capture of Winchester, they captured enough artillery and horses to equip a battalion of infantry and cavalry, including 28 guns (23 at Winchester and 5 at Martinsburg) and 300 horses in total. Additionally, the Confederates captured a great quantity of food, clothing, small arms ammunition and medical stores in Winchester. Following this battle, a Court of Inquiry was held, and both President Abraham Lincoln and Halleck desired to know who disobeyed the orders to \\"evacuate Winchester\\". President Abraham Lincoln wrote to Milroy: The nature of the inquiry was later changed from investigating who disobeyed orders to evacuate Winchester, to the discovery of the events and nature of the retreat from Winchester. Milroy was exonerated and claimed that his brilliant defensive action at Winchester was instrumental in causing the timing of the Battle of Gettysburg, leading to the overall Union victory for the campaign. Despite this, Halleck insisted that Milroy not be given any more commands. Contribution to Lee's Gettysburg Campaign The victory at Second Winchester cleared the Valley of Federal troops and opened the door for Lee's second invasion of the North. The capturing of ample supplies justified Lee's conceptual plan to provision his army on the march. The Federal defeat stunned the North, and Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton called for additional militia to be federalized. Shortly afterwards, President Lincoln requested 100,000 volunteers to repel the threatened invasion. Several fleeing members of the scattered 87th Pennsylvania hastily tramped back to their homes near Gettysburg and in adjoining York County, Pennsylvania, spreading news to local officials that the Confederates were now in the Valley in strength, with apparent designs on invading Pennsylvania. Gov. Andrew Curtin of Pennsylvania, in response to these reports and other military intelligence, called for 50,000 volunteers to protect the Keystone State.Scott L. Mingus, Flames Beyond Gettysburg: The Gordon Expedition, Columbus, Ohio: Ironclad Publishing, 2009. Ewell's followup Immediately following the battle, Ewell dispatched the entire Corps cavalry brigade under Jenkins on a raid to Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, to forage and reconnoiter. Ewell placed his Second Corps Headquarters about 3 miles north of Winchester and then at Mr. Boyd's house near Bunker's Hill.Hotchkiss, p. 152-153. The captured flag of Fort Milroy was used to create a new Confederate flag, and Ewell and Early attended a christening ceremony in which the new flag was hosted, and the fort officially renamed \\"Fort Jackson\\" in honor of the recently slain former Second Corps commander. Topographer Jedediah Hotchkiss then commenced an all day survey, creating his now famous map of the battle which appears at the head of this article. Leadership contribution Jubal Early's leadership in this battle was superb. Later, Lee had the utmost confidence in Early, ultimately giving him not just the Confederate Second Corps, but a new Valley District army to try again, in 1864, the distracting demonstration invasion of the United States that Lee had always dreamed of. Early succeeded, where Lee failed twice at Sharpsburg and Gettysburg, and shelled Fort Stevens in Washington, D.C.

He worked primarily with historical and literary subjects, but his best-known paintings dealt with the Indian Mutiny. Eastward, Ho!, dated August 1857 but exhibited the following year, depicts the British troops embarking for India. A second painting, Home Again (1859), shows the troops returning to England. He also had popular successes with romantic scenes portraying the deaths of Mozart and Raphael, depicted as though mentally transported to heaven by their own religious art. In The Last Moments of Mozart the dying composer listens to singers performing part of his Requiem. The Last Moments of Raphael shows the painter contemplating the unseen figure of Christ in his Transfiguration. O'Neil was a member of The Clique, a group of artists in the 1840s who, like the later Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, met regularly to discuss and criticize one another's works. The other members of The Clique were Augustus Egg, Alfred Elmore, Richard Dadd, William Powell Frith, John Phillip, Edward Matthew Ward. Most of the Clique opposed the Pre-Raphaelites, but O'Neil was the most virulent in his condemnation of the movement, attacking them in both paintings and writings. These included his futuristic fantasy Two Thousand Years Hence (1867), which portrayed Britain in the year 3867 as a frozen wasteland excavated by an archaeologist from New Zealand. The archaeologist uncovers evidence of the decline of British culture in the nineteenth century, allowing O'Neil to vent his own distinctly reactionary political views, predicting dire consequences of the Reform Act 1867. In July, 1865, O'Neil accompanied the Great Eastern on her voyage to lay the cable of the Atlantic telegraph, hoping to find on board a subject suitable for a picture: the unfortunate breaking of the cable, however, prevented the accomplishment of the artist‚Äôs intention. During the voyage he edited and illustrated five issues of the shipboard newsletter The Atlantic Telegraph, and on his return to England he published an account of the expedition in Blackwood‚Äôs Edinburgh Magazine. In 1866 he again accompanied the cable expedition, producing five more publications which were printed on board, and later wrote a humorous account of the voyage for the magazine London Society.

Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart's cavalry screened Gen. Robert E. Lee's Confederate infantry as it marched north in the Shenandoah Valley behind the sheltering Blue Ridge Mountains. The pursuing Union cavalry of Brig. Gen. Judson Kilpatrick's brigade, in the advance of Brig. Gen. David McM. Gregg's division, encountered Col. Thomas T. Munford's troopers near the village of Aldie, resulting in four hours of stubborn fighting. Both sides made mounted assaults by regiments and squadrons. Kilpatrick was reinforced in the afternoon, and Munford finally withdrew toward Middleburg. Background Late in the spring of 1863 tensions grew between Union commander Joseph Hooker and his cavalry commander Brig. Gen. Alfred Pleasonton because of the latter's inability to penetrate Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart's cavalry screen and gain access to the Shenandoah Valley to locate the Army of Northern Virginia, which had been on the move since the Battle of Chancellorsville in early May. On June 17, Pleasonton decided to push through Stuart's screen. To accomplish his goal he ordered Brig. Gen. David McM. Gregg's division from Manassas Junction westward down the Little River Turnpike to Aldie. Aldie was tactically important in that near the village the Little River Turnpike intersected both the Ashby's Gap Turnpike and Snicker's Gap Turnpike, which respectively led through Ashby's Gap and Snickers Gap of the Blue Ridge Mountain into the valley. Battle Map of battlefield core and study areas. Glazier at the Aldie\\" as depicted in Sword and pen - or, Ventures and adventures of Willard Glazier in war and literature (1890) by John Algernon Owens Early that very same morning, Colonel Munford led the 2nd and 3rd Virginia Cavalry eastward across the Loudoun Valley from Upperville through Middleburg to Aldie on the Bull Run Mountains on a reconnaissance and forage mission. He established a line of pickets in Aldie to watch for enemy activity and withdrew his two regiments northwest of town on the Snicker's Gap Turnpike to camp on the farm of Franklin Carter. About 4 pm, Gregg's advance column of the 2nd and 4th New York, 6th Ohio, 1st Maine, 1st Rhode Island, and 1st Massachusetts, under the command of Brig. Gen. Judson Kilpatrick arrived in Aldie. Just west of the village the 1st Massachusetts encountered Munford's pickets and drove them back. Around the same time, the rest of Munford's brigade (the 1st, 4th, and 5th Virginia Cavalry, under the command of Col. Williams Carter Wickham) arrived at Dover Mills, a small hamlet on the Little River west of Aldie. Wickham ordered Col. Thomas L. Rosser to take the 5th Virginia to locate a campsite closer to Aldie. As they moved east they ran into the Massachusetts men and easily drove them back through Aldie to the main Union body. After positioning his sharpshooters (50 men of Company I under Capt. Reuben F. Boston) east of the William Adam farmhouse, Rosser deployed west along a ridge that covered the two roads leading out of Aldie and awaited the arrival of the Federals, as well as Munford and Wickham. As Rosser withdrew west, the 1st Massachusetts, with aid from the 4th New York, charged against what they believed to be a retreat. Rosser's line held and he mounted a countercharge in concert with a sharp volley from the sharpshooters he had placed on his left and easily drove the Federals back, securing his hold on the Ashby's Gap Turnpike. Kilpatrick then turned his attention towards the Snicker's Gap Turnpike. An artillery duel ensued and more cavalry on both sides soon arrived. A furious fight erupted, which at first went in favor of Munford as Federal charges were met, stopped, and then forced back by the withering volley of sharpshooters entrenched along a stone wall. The 1st Massachusetts Cavalry was trapped in a blind curve on the Snicker's Gap Turnpike and was destroyed, losing 198 of 294 men in the eight companies that were engaged. One detachment under Henry Lee Higginson was virtually wiped out in hand-to-hand fighting. The tide finally turned as Union reinforcements charged into the fray in the fading light and the 6th Ohio overran Boston's detachment on the Ashby's Gap Turnpike, capturing or killing most of his men. The fighting died down around 8 pm as Munford withdrew his command west towards Middleburg. Aftermath Monument to the 1st Massachusetts Munford did not consider Aldie a defeat because his withdrawal coincided with an order from Stuart to retire, as more Federal cavalry had been sighted at Middleburg. Union casualties were 305 dead and wounded, with the Confederates losing between 110 and 119. Aldie was the first in a series of small battles along the Ashby's Gap Turnpike in which Stuart's forces successfully delayed Pleasonton's thrust across the Loudoun Valley, depriving him of the opportunity to locate Lee's army. Battlefield Although not fully protected, the battlefield remains largely intact. Aldie and its mill look much as they did at the time of the battle. Widening of U.S. Route 50 has compromised the portion of the battlefield along the Ashby's Gap Turnpike. The stone wall and farmsteads remain intact along the Snicker's Gap Turnpike (present day Route 734). At the site of the stone wall along the blind curve where the 1st Massachusetts was decimated, a monument erected by the survivors stands to honor the service during the battle. On May 8, 2012, Gov. Bob McDonnell announced the preservation of a five-acre site to be purchased by the Civil War Trust and later to be operated as a passive historic interpretative site by the park authority.

It was located to the southeast of Holborn Viaduct, and east of Farringdon Street. The station was opened in 1874 by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway to alleviate increased usage of the nearby Ludgate Hill station. It was originally a through station, with services continuing through the Snow Hill Tunnel to Farringdon and King's Cross. Passenger services through the tunnel ceased in 1916, and consequently Holborn Viaduct became a terminal station. The short distance between itself and Ludgate Hill saw the latter being closed in 1929. Holborn Viaduct station became less used through the 20th century, serving a few local commuting services around southeast London and Kent. The station became redundant with the creation of the Thameslink service in the late 1980s, and was closed in 1990 under British Rail, being effectively replaced at the same location by St. Paul's Thameslink station (later renamed City Thameslink). Opening A 1914 Railway Clearing House map of lines around the sites of Holborn Viaduct railway station and Snow Hill railway station. The London Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR) had changed its name from the East Kent Railway in 1859, in order to compete with the rivalling South Eastern Railway (SER) and build a railway into Central London. They had opened station on 1 June 1865, but it had begun to struggle with increasing numbers of trains. The LCDR was suffering financial problems following the extravagant spending to build the line (which would plague the company for the rest of its lifespan), and was unable to raise capital to expand the station. The London and South Western Railway (LSWR) had agreed to fund ¬£310,000 to the LCDR, while the Great Northern Railway donated ¬£320,000. A shell company, the Holborn Viaduct Station Company, was set up to construct a branch from the Ludgate Hill-Farringdon line that would terminate at a new station located on Holborn Viaduct, which would also have a new hotel forming its frontage. Holborn Viaduct was constructed as a six-platform terminus, with two island platforms and two side platforms, covered by a three-roof train shed. Each of the platforms was long. The redevelopment that began in 1963 saw the replacement of the train shed with shorter platform canopies, while a new concourse was constructed within the new office building on the ground floor level; the platforms were located at the first floor level. The station opened on 2 March 1874 with the intention that it be used as a terminus for main line and continental trains. These services were intended to operate to both the City of London and the West End of London. Holborn Viaduct was well placed for this, as it was near the City and the mainline terminals along the New Road, yet also the nearest terminus to South London. Trains would travel as far as where they would split, with one portion going to Holborn Viaduct and the other to Victoria. Local services carried on through the Snow Hill Tunnel to join the Metropolitan Railway's Widened Lines at Farringdon Street (now Farringdon), with a pair of low-level platforms just north of Holborn Viaduct to allow interchange with the main line services. Opened on 1 August 1874, these platforms formed a small station named Snow Hill, which was renamed Holborn Viaduct Low Level on 1 May 1912. On 10 May 1886, St Paul's station opened further south on the LC&DR; line, just to the north of Blackfriars Bridge. This caused a drop in traffic at Holborn Viaduct, as St Paul's was more accessible for some destinations. Hotel Holborn Viaduct station and hotel in 1908 The Holborn Viaduct Hotel was designed by Lewis H. Isaacs, and opened on 17 November 1877. It was so well-integrated with the station that it was difficult for the casual traveller in central London to spot the main entrance. The hotel was run by the caterers Spiers & Pond, who were already co-operating with the LCDR, and became official caterers to the LSWR in 1888, and the SER the following year. J. Lyons and Co. took over operations in 1905. It was used for wireless communications during World War I. Reorganisation The rail approach to Holborn Viaduct in 1953 Passenger traffic through the Snow Hill Tunnel ceased on 3 April 1916, which saw the low-level platforms closed, and Holborn Viaduct become a terminus for passenger services from the south of London into the City. The station came under the control of the Southern Railway (SR) in the 1923 Grouping. On 21 March 1926, the signalling system at Holborn Viaduct was upgraded to use colour-light. The distance of just between Holborn Viaduct and St. Paul's station (now named Blackfriars) led to the intermediate station at Ludgate Hill being closed on 3 March 1929. The route was electrified in 1925 for services from and , with the first service opening on 12 July. The line from Bickley to was electrified in 1934, with an electric service between Holborn Viaduct and starting the following year. Electric services to Gillingham began on 2 July 1939, which involved extending Platform 1 to . This extension caused problems with arrivals and departures, due to all the trains running in such a restricted space. The station was not directly damaged by any action in World War II, but the hotel was hit by a bomb on 26 October, and then destroyed by fire overnight on 10‚Äì11 May 1941. The station was closed until 1 June as a result. A signal box to the south of the station, and a nearby bridge over Southwark Street, were destroyed by overnight bombing on 16‚Äì17 April 1941. A temporary replacement opened on 29 September, with a permanent arrangement opening on 9 October 1942. Post-nationalisation Holborn Viaduct platforms in 1985 Following the war, services to Holborn Viaduct began to be withdrawn. The electrification of the Kent Coast route led to two basic services operating all day from the station: to Sevenoaks and West Croydon, with peak time services to a number of other destinations. The station was rebuilt between 1960‚Äì63. In 1963 the hotel, which had been heavily damaged during the Blitz, was demolished and redeveloped, with a new 10-storey office building replacing it. It opened on 9 September. Two platforms were removed from the station in 1973, as services were reduced and parcel traffic stopped running. The station was closed on Saturdays after 2 May 1970, and after 7:30pm on weekdays from 1 June 1981. It remained popular for commuter services into the 1980s, serving over 22,000 passengers on 200 trains every day. In 1984, British Rail proposed using Snow Hill Tunnel as a bypass for the station; driver-only trains would run from Blackfriars to Farringdon and then on to Kings Cross, allowing passengers to skip the change of trains at Holborn Viaduct. Holborn Viaduct station was temporarily closed on 18 August 1986, then re-opened on 30 August. In 1988, Snow Hill Tunnel was restored and passenger trains began running through as a north-south rail link through central London. The Thameslink plan was to build a new underground station in the vicinity, to be called St. Paul's Thameslink. Its construction required the demolition of the bridge to Holborn Viaduct from Ludgate Hill. The last train out of Holborn Viaduct was a special formed of two Class 411 units (8 CEP). It was an \\"enthusiast special\\" which started at Holborn Viaduct at 19:40 on 26 January 1990, and visited several London terminals used at that time by Network SouthEast: Victoria, London Bridge, and Cannon Street. It terminated at Charing Cross. Holborn Viaduct station was closed permanently by British Rail on 29 January 1990. The frontage of the station buildings was incorporated into the new Thameslink station, which formed part of a new development funded by a commercial property company.

Both the President and the National Assembly are directly elected by voters, with elections organised by the Autonomous National Electoral Commission (CENA). Electoral history In 1926 three elected seats were created on the Administrative Council. Elections with a severely limited franchise were held in 1925, 1928, 1932, 1934 and 1936. Following World War II, the territory began to elect members to the French National Assembly. The first of these elections took place on 21 October 1945, with Dahomey and neighbouring Togo combined into a single constituency. Two MPs were elected using separate electoral colleges for French citizens and Africans. A by-election was held in February 1946 after one of the two elected MPs died in December 1945, with a second full election for the combined constituency held in June 1946. By the November 1946 elections, Dahomey had become a single-member seat. A General Council was established in the same period and was first elected in January 1947.Patrick Manning (2004) Slavery, Colonialism and Economic Growth in Dahomey, 1640-1960, Cambridge University Press, p276 The result was a victory for the Dahomeyan Progressive Union, which won 20 of the 30 elected seats. French National Assembly elections were held again in 1951, with Dahomey now having two seats; the Liste de l'Union Fran√ßaise and the Ethnic Group of the North (GEN) each won one seat. The General Council was converted into the Territorial Assembly in 1952, with the first elections to the new body resulting in a victory for the Republican Party of Dahomey (PRD), which won 19 of the 32 seats elected by the second college. The final French National Assembly election in Dahomey was held in 1956, with the PRD and GEN each winning a seat. The Republican Party went on to win the 1957 Territorial Assembly elections. It also won the 1959 elections, despite receiving fewer votes than the Dahomeyan Democratic Union (UDD), which emerged as the smallest of the three parties in the legislature. Following claims of fraud, the PRD gave nine seats to the UDD, although it remained the largest party. Following independence on 1 August 1960, parliamentary elections were held in December. The newly established Dahomeyan Unity Party won all 60 seats following changes to the electoral system by President Hubert Maga.Mathurin C Houngnikpo & Samuel Decalo (2012) Historical Dictionary of Benin, Scarecrow Press, p38 The country subsequently became a one-party state, and the Dahomeyan Democratic Party was the only party to contest the elections in 1964, winning all 42 seats. Following a military coup, attempts were made to reintroduce democracy; presidential elections were held in May 1968, but the results were invalidated due to insufficient voter turnout. The military government subsequently appointed √âmile Derlin Zinsou as President, but he took the post on the condition that he was approved by voters. A subsequent vote on his candidacy was approved by just over three- quarters of voters. Another military coup led to presidential elections in 1970. Although they were won by Justin Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin, this was due to the results in Atakora being annulled, denying Hubert Maga victory. In order to prevent a civil war, Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin, Maga and the other main candidate Sourou-Migan Apithy agreed to form a three-member presidential council. However, this lasted only until another coup in 1972. The country subsequently reverted to being a one-party state with the People's Revolutionary Party of Benin as the sole legal party. A National Revolutionary Assembly was established in 1977, and one-party elections were held in 1979, 1984 and 1989, before multi-party democracy was reintroduced at the start of the 1990s. Parliamentary elections held in February 1991 saw 12 parties and alliances win seats in the National Assembly, with the Union for the Triumph of Democratic Renewal (UTRD) emerging as the largest group with just 12 of the 64 seats. UTRD candidate Nic√©phore Soglo subsequently won the presidential elections in March, beating incumbent Mathieu K√©r√©kou in a runoff. Parliamentary elections in 1995 saw 18 groups win seats in the enlarged 83-seat National Assembly; the Benin Rebirth Party became the largest party with 21 seats. The following year Soglo lost the presidential elections to K√©r√©kou, who ran as an independent. Although Soglo received the most votes in the first round, K√©r√©kou won 52% of the vote in the second. The 1999 parliamentary elections resulted in 16 groups winning seats; the Benin Rebirth Party remained the largest party with 27 seats. In 2001 K√©r√©kou was re-elected president, running as the Action Front for Renewal and Development (FARD) candidate. However, the election was marred by the withdrawal of Soglo from the run-off after he alleged fraud. With third-place Adrien Houngb√©dji also refusing to participate, K√©r√©kou faced Bruno Amoussou in the second round, winning with 84% of the vote. The 2003 parliamentary elections saw the majority of parties contest under the Presidential Movement or Opposition banner, with the pro-K√©r√©kou Presidential Movement (dominated by the FARD-based Union for Future Benin) winning a majority of seats. The 2006 presidential election saw both K√©r√©kou and Soglo barred from running by term limits and age. Yayi Boni defeated Houngb√©dji in the run-off, receiving 75% of the vote. Parliamentary elections the following year saw the pro-Boni Cowry Forces for an Emerging Benin (FCBE) emerge as the largest faction, with 35 of the 83 seats. Boni was re-elected in March 2011 with 53% of the vote, the first time a presidential candidate had won in the first round of voting since the run-off was introduced. In the parliamentary elections the following month the FCBE won 41 seats, narrowly missing out on obtaining a parliamentary majority. Parliamentary elections in 2015 saw the FCBE‚ÄìAmana Alliance coalition emerge as the largest faction in the National Assembly with 33 seats. The 2016 presidential elections saw the FCBE candidate Lionel Zinsou receive the most votes in the first round, but then defeated in the second round by independent candidate Patrice Talon. Electoral system=President The President of Benin is elected using the two-round system. National Assembly During the one-party state era, elections to the National Revolutionary Assembly were conducted in the form of a referendum. Voters were presented with a single list of the ruling People's Revolutionary Party of Benin's candidates to vote for or against.Elections held in 1989 IPU Term length was originally three years,Benin IPU but was extended to five years in the early 1980s.Benin IPU The number of seats varied; starting with 336 in 1979, reduced to 196 in 1984 and increased to 206 in 1989. Currently the 83 seats in the National Assembly are elected by proportional representation in 24 multi-member constituencies.Electoral system IPU There are two constituencies for each of the country's 12 departments. Voters must be at Beninese citizens aged 18 or over. However, people can be disqualified from voting if they are in contempt of court, have an undischarged bankruptcy or are imprisoned for at least three months for certain offences. Candidates must be at least 25 years old and have been resident in Benin for at least a year before the election. If not holding Beninese citizenship by birth, they must have lived in the country for at least 10 years. Government ministers, people working for businesses subsidised by state funds, people holding non- elected public office, involved in the military or working for foreign government or international organisations are not allowed to contest to stand as candidates. Referendums During the colonial era, voters participated in French constitutional referendums in 1945, May 1946 and October 1946. The 1958 referendum on the new constitution of the French Fifth Republic was effectively an independence referendum, as if the terms of the constitution were rejected, the country would become an independent state. However, it was approved by 98% of voters, and Guinea was the only territory to reject the referendum. Following independence in 1960, a constitutional referendum was held in 1964, with the proposed changes to the constitution creating a presidential system of government, scrapping term limits for the president, and having a unicameral parliament.Dahomey (Benin), 5 January 1964: Constitution Direct Democracy It was approved by 99.8% of voters. Another constitutional referendum was held in 1968, with 92% voting in favour. The most recent constitutional referendum was held in 1990. The main changes were a proposed return to multi-party democracy, with a secondary question for those voting in favour of the change, as to whether the president should be subject to term limits; 93% voted in favour of the proposed changes, with 73% of all voters in favour of term limits.

During the Second World War his distinctive voice became synonymous with the reading of news. Early life Lidell was born in Wimbledon Park, Surrey, to Swedish parents. His father John Adrian Lidell was a timber importer; his mother was Gertrud Lidell (n√©e Lundstr√∂m). Lidell attended King's College School, Wimbledon and Exeter College, Oxford. As a boy, he studied piano, piccolo, cello and singing, and was a noted actor at Oxford. BBC After some brief teaching and singing jobs, he joined BBC Birmingham as chief announcer, transferring to London after a year. He became deputy chief announcer in 1937, and the following year married Nancy Margaret Corfield, a lawyer‚Äôs daughter (they had two daughters and a son). He made some historic broadcasts, including the announcement of Edward VIII‚Äôs abdication. On 3 September 1939 he read the ultimatum to Germany from 10 Downing Street then, at 11 a.m. introduced Neville Chamberlain who told the nation that it was at war with Germany. It was during the Second World War that the BBC named its previously anonymous announcers and newsreaders - to distinguish them from enemy propagandists. During the war, \\"Here is the news, and this is Alvar Lidell reading it\\" became an inadvertent catchphrase. Announcing the British victory at El Alamein, he said \\"Here is the news, and cracking good news it is too!\\" In 1943 he served with the RAF as an intelligence officer (some of the time at Bletchley ParkBletchley Park People: Churchill's Geese That Never Cackled, Marion Hill, Sutton Publishing 2004, ), but returned to the BBC a year later. In 1946 he was appointed chief announcer on the new BBC Third Programme, where he remained for six years, maintaining the highest standards, particularly over pronunciation and phrasing. In 1952 the BBC‚Äôs news service was reorganised, and he returned as a newsreader, even doing a little television work. He was appointed an MBE in 1964 and retired in 1969. In 1979 he published an article about the deteriorating standards of speech at the BBC in The Listener - the BBC immediately set up a panel of experts to report on the matter. Lidell also worked as a narrator, and recorded over 237 volumes for Books for the Blind, including long works such as Anna Karenina. As a baritone, he gave recitals and recorded with Gerald Moore at the piano. In 1970 Lidell was heard as narrator on the Apple Records recording of The Whale by composer John Tavener. Recordings of Lidell's news bulletins have been included in many films set in Britain during the Second World War, such as the movie Battle of Britain (1969). In later life he lived for a time at Little Knighton, Worcestershire, England. He died at Northwood, Middlesex, aged 72.

All agents of the food and fiber value chain and those institutions that influence it are part of the agribusiness system. Within the agriculture industry, \\"agribusiness\\" refers to the range of activities and disciplines encompassed by modern food production. There are academic degrees specializing in agribusiness, departments of agribusiness, agribusiness trade associations, and agribusiness publications. In the context of agribusiness management in academia, each individual element of agriculture production and distribution may be described as agribusinesses. However, the term \\"agribusiness\\" most often emphasizes the \\"interdependence\\" of these various sectors within the production chain. Among critics of large-scale, industrialized, vertically integrated food production, the term agribusiness is used negatively, synonymous with corporate farming. As such, it is often contrasted with smaller family-owned farms.  Examples  Agribusinesses include seed and agrichemical producers like Dow AgroSciences, DuPont, Monsanto, and Syngenta; AB Agri (part of Associated British Foods) animal feeds, biofuels, and micro-ingredients, ADM, grain transport and processing; John Deere, farm machinery producer; Ocean Spray, farmer's cooperative; and Purina Farms, agritourism farm. As concern over global warming intensifies, biofuels derived from crops are gaining increased public and scientific attention. This is driven by factors such as oil price spikes, the need for increased energy security, concern over greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels, and support from government subsidies. In Europe and in the US, increased research and production of biofuels have been mandated by law.  Studies and reports  Studies of agribusiness often come from the academic fields of agricultural economics and management studies, sometimes called agribusiness management. To promote more development of food economies, many government agencies support the research and publication of economic studies and reports exploring agribusiness and agribusiness practices. Some of these studies are on foods produced for export and are derived from agencies focused on food exports. These agencies include the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC), Austrade, and New Zealand Trade and Enterprise (NZTE). The Federation of International Trade Associations publishes studies and reports by FAS and AAFC, as well as other non-governmental organizations on its website. In their book A Concept of Agribusiness, Ray Goldberg and John Davis provided a rigorous economic framework for the field. They traced a complex value-added chain that begins with the farmer's purchase of seed and livestock and ends with a product fit for the consumer's table. Agribusiness boundary expansion is driven by a variety of transaction costs.

Valvano had an excellent coaching career with multiple schools, most notably at North Carolina State University. While the head coach at NC State, his team won the 1983 national title against improbable odds. Valvano is most remembered for his ecstatic celebration after winning the national championship against the heavily-favored Houston Cougars. After his career, Valvano gave an inspirational and memorable speech in 1993 at the ESPY Awards, while terminally ill with cancer, telling listeners to laugh, think, and cry each day, saying \\"don‚Äôt give up. Don‚Äôt ever give up\\".Full Video & Transcript of ESPY speech He gave the speech less than two months before his death from adenocarcinoma, a type of many glandular cancers. The ESPY Awards now include the Jimmy V Award named in his honor. Each year, a college basketball tournament called the Jimmy V Classic is held in his honor and in support of cancer victims and survivors. Early years Valvano was the middle child of Rocco and Angelina Valvano, and was born in Corona, Queens, New York. Valvano was a three-sport athlete at Seaford High School in Seaford on Long Island and graduated in 1963. Football coach Vince Lombardi was Valvano's role model. Valvano told an ESPY audience, on March 3, 1993, that he took some of Lombardi's inspirational speeches out of the book Commitment to Excellence, and used them with his team. Valvano discussed how he planned to use Lombardi's speech to the Green Bay Packers in front of his Rutgers freshman basketball team prior to his first game as their coach. He also mentioned that he accidentally told his team to \\"fight for the Green Bay Packers.\\" College playing career Valvano was a point guard at Rutgers University in 1967, where he partnered with first-team All-American Bob Lloyd in the backcourt. Under the leadership of Valvano and Lloyd, Rutgers finished third in the 1967 National Invitation Tournament (NIT), which was the last basketball tournament held at the third Madison Square Garden. (The 1967 NCAA Tournament field was just 23 teams and the NIT invited 14 teams.) He was named Senior Athlete of the Year at Rutgers in 1967, and graduated with a degree in English in 1967. Coaching career Valvano coaching N.C. State in 1983 Following graduation, Valvano began his coaching career at Rutgers as the freshman coach and assistant for the varsity. His 19-year career as a head basketball coach began at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore for a season; he was then an assistant at Connecticut for two years. Following that, he was the head coach at Bucknell, Iona, and North Carolina State. Following Norm Sloan's departure to Florida, Valvano was hired at NC State on March 27, 1980, and made his debut on November 29, when the Wolfpack defeated UNC-Wilmington 83-59. During his ten seasons at NC State, Valvano's teams were the ACC's tournament champions in 1983 and 1987 and its regular season champions in 1985 and 1989. The Wolfpack won the NCAA championship in 1983, in addition to advancing to the NCAA Elite 8 in 1985 and 1986. \\"Coach V\\" was voted ACC Coach of the Year in 1989. Valvano became NC State's athletic director in 1986. His overall record at NC State was 209‚Äì114 () and his career record as a head coach was 346‚Äì210 (). Valvano is most recognized for his reaction of running around on the court looking for somebody to hug in the moments after the Wolfpack victory came after the game- winning shot in the 1983 NCAA finals. Dereck Whittenburg heaved a last-second desperation shot that was caught short of the rim and dunked by Lorenzo Charles as time expired. Controversy In 1989, accusations of rules violations surfaced in the book Personal Fouls by Peter Golenbock. These accusations centered mostly on high school All-American Chris Washburn, who managed only a 470 out of 1600 on his SAT (with 400 being the starting score). A 1989 NCAA investigation cleared Valvano, but found that players sold shoes and game tickets. As a result, NC State placed its basketball program on probation for two years (the maximum) and was banned from participating in the 1990 NCAA tournament. The state-appointed Poole Commission issued a 32-page report that concluded that there were no major violations of NCAA regulations, and that Valvano and his staff's inadequate oversight of players' academic progress violated \\"the spirit, not the letter of the law\\". After this report, Valvano was forced to resign as the school's athletic director in October 1989. He remained as basketball coach through the 1989‚Äì90 season. Under subsequent pressure from the school's faculty and new Chancellor, Valvano negotiated a settlement with NC State and resigned as basketball coach on April 7, 1990. Six separate entities investigated Valvano and the NC State basketball program including the NC State Faculty Senate, the North Carolina Attorney General, the University of North Carolina Board of Governors, the NC State Board of Trustees, and the NCAA. None of them found any evidence of recruiting violations or academic or financial impropriety on the part of Valvano or his staff. Dave Didion, the NCAA investigator handling Valvano's case, wrote a personal letter to Valvano, saying, among other things, \\"If I had a son, I would feel comfortable with you as his coach and encourage him to learn from you.\\" A school investigation did reveal that Valvano's student- athletes did not perform well in the classroom, as only 11 of the players that he coached prior to 1988 had maintained an average of C or better. Valvano's version of these events can be found in his 1991 autobiography, Valvano: They Gave Me a Lifetime Contract, and Then They Declared Me Dead. After coaching After his coaching career, Valvano was a broadcaster for ESPN and ABC Sports, including a stint as a sideline reporter for the inaugural season of the World League of American Football. In 1992, Valvano won a Cable ACE Award for Commentator/Analyst for NCAA basketball broadcasts. From time to time he was paired with basketball analyst Dick Vitale, dubbed the \\"Killer Vees\\", with similar voices and exuberant styles. The two even made a cameo appearance, playing the role of professional movers (V&V; Movers), on an episode of The Cosby Show. Valvano created JTV enterprises to guide many of his entrepreneurial endeavors. He gave hundreds of motivational speeches across the country and was a featured guest on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and Late Night with David Letterman. Cancer In June 1992, Valvano was diagnosed with metastatic adenocarcinoma, a type of glandular cancer that can spread to the bones. One of Valvano's most memorable motivational speeches was delivered at NC State's Reynolds Coliseum, less than 10 weeks before his death, during the 10-year commemoration of the 1983 NCAA championship. It was during this speech on February 21 that Valvano stressed the importance of hope, love, and persistence, and included his famous \\"Don't give up, don't ever give up\\" quotation. ESPY speech Eleven days later on Thursday, March 4, 1993, he spoke at the first ESPY Awards at Madison Square Garden, presented by ESPN. While accepting the inaugural Arthur Ashe Courage and Humanitarian Award, he announced the creation of The V Foundation for Cancer Research, an organization dedicated to finding a cure for cancer. He announced that the foundation's motto would be \\"Don't Give Up...Don't Ever Give Up\\". During his speech, the teleprompter stated that he had thirty seconds left, to which Valvano responded, \\"That screen up there is flashing 30 seconds, like I care about that screen right now, huh? I got tumors all over my body and I'm worried about some guy in the back going '30 seconds'\\". His speech included this statement: > To me, there are three things we all should do every day. We should do this > every day of our lives. Number one is laugh. You should laugh every day. > Number two is think. You should spend some time in thought. And number three > is, you should have your emotions moved to tears, could be happiness or joy. > But think about it. If you laugh, you think, and you cry, that's a full day. > That's a heck of a day. You do that seven days a week, you're going to have > something special. Valvano's ESPY acceptance speech became legendary. He closed by saying that \\"Cancer can take away all of my physical abilities. It cannot touch my mind, it cannot touch my heart, and it cannot touch my soul. And those three things are going to carry on forever. I thank you and God bless you all.\\" He received a standing ovation. Valvano's hair was expected to fall out with chemotherapy treatment, but it didn't. Along with his ever-positive outlook, this masked to the public how serious his sickness was and the amount of pain he was dealing with. He preemptively had his head shaved and was prepared to use a variety of whimsical wigs on his broadcasts, but his own hair remained. Yankees New York native Valvano had always wanted to throw out the first pitch at Yankee Stadium. He had been given that honor for the 1993 season opener to be held on April 12, but he was too ill to do so. Coaching rival and friend Dean Smith, one week removed from leading North Carolina to the national championship, substituted for Valvano. Death Valvano died at age 47 on April 28, 1993, less than two months after his famous ESPY speech, following a nearly yearlong battle with metastatic cancer. Valvano died at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, 10 years to the month after winning the national championship in one of the biggest upsets in the history of the tournament. He is buried in the Cedar Hill Section of Oakwood Cemetery in Raleigh. His tombstone reads: \\"Take time every day to laugh, to think, to cry.\\" Lorenzo Charles, the player who dunked the winning basket in the 1983 NCAA championship game, died in a crash while driving a bus on June 27, 2011, and was buried near Valvano in Oakwood Cemetery. Coincidentally, Valvano and Charles were both 47 when they died. Pam Valvano survives him. Legacy In 1983, Valvano coined the term \\"Survive and Advance.\\" A 1996 TV movie titled Never Give Up: The Jimmy V Story, starred Anthony LaPaglia as Valvano. The movie was filmed in various locations including Wilmington, North Carolina, and on the campus of the University of North Carolina Wilmington. In 1993, Valvano was inducted into the Rutgers Basketball Hall of Fame. In 1999, Valvano was inducted into both the Hall of Distinguished Alumni at Rutgers University and the New York City Basketball Hall of Fame. In 2004, Valvano was inducted into the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame. In 2012, he was named to the first class of the NC State Athletics Hall of Fame. On March 17, 2013, ESPN broadcast \\"Survive and Advance,\\" a documentary on North Carolina State's 1983 championship run, as part of its 30 for 30 Volume II anthology series. Along with the 1983 season, it also covered the final months of his life during his battle with cancer. The documentary was first broadcast on the 30th anniversary of the Wolfpack's double overtime victory against Pepperdine in the first round of the 1983 NCAA tournament. On March 1, 2016, a book by John Feinstein titled The Legends Club: Dean Smith, Mike Krzyzewski, Jim Valvano, and an Epic College Basketball Rivalry was released to critical reviews. Krzyzewski arrived at Duke the same season as Valvano did at North Carolina State. On Wednesday, December 6, 2018, North Carolina State University named the arena inside Reynolds Colliseum on the university campus James T. Valvano Arena. Personal Valvano married his high school sweetheart, Pamela Levine, and they had three daughters, Nicole, Jamie, and Lee Ann. His younger brother, Bob, is a sportscaster and former basketball coach.

The Battle of Middleburg took place from June 17 to June 19, 1863, in Loudoun County, Virginia, as part of the Gettysburg Campaign of the American Civil War. Confederate Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart, screening Robert E. Lee's invasion route, sparred with Maj. Gen. Alfred Pleasonton's Union cavalry. On June 17, Col. Alfred N. Duffi√©'s isolated 1st Rhode Island Cavalry Regiment was attacked by the brigades of Thomas T. Munford and Beverly Robertson. The 1st Rhode Island was routed, taking about 250 casualties. On June 19, J. Irvin Gregg's brigade advanced, driving Stuart's cavalry one mile beyond the town. Both sides were reinforced, and mounted and dismounted skirmishing continued. Stuart was gradually levered out of his position but fell back to a second ridge, still covering the approaches to the Blue Ridge gap. Skirmish of June 17 Stuart established his headquarters at Middleburg and scattered his brigades throughout the Loudoun Valley to watch for enemy activity. Early in the morning, Col. Duffi√©, a French-born officer, had taken the 280 men of the 1st Rhode Island Cavalry westward from the Army of the Potomac's camp near Centreville. Pleasonton had ordered him to camp at Middleburg that evening and then to proceed the next day toward Noland's Ferry, extending his march to the west as far as Snickersville. Duffi√© crossed the Bull Run Mountains at Thoroughfare Gap at 9:30 a.m., easily pushing aside pickets from John R. Chambliss's brigade. Confederate commanders could not believe that a small Union regiment would dare to travel so deep into enemy territory without an escort, so Chambliss did not aggressively attack, fearing that the column was the advance element of a much larger enemy force. Duffi√© continued on his isolated march, turning to the north by 11:00 a.m. and heading for Middleburg as ordered. Arriving there about 4:00 p.m., Duffi√© drove in the few Confederate pickets deployed there and disrupted Stuart's evening of socializing with local ladies. Stuart and his staff quickly retreated to Rector's Crossroads, the location of his closest brigade. He ordered Beverly Robertson to move immediately to Middleburg to crush the Union cavalry. Duffi√© barricaded the streets of Middleburg, dismounted half of his regiment behind stonewalls, and sent for help from Judson Kilpatrick's brigade near Aldie. At 7:00 p.m., Stuart's attack routed the vastly outnumbered Rhode Islanders. Many of Duffi√©'s men were captured the next morning as Chambliss cut off their escape route. The Parisian colonel finally returned to Centreville with only 4 officers and 27 men. A few stragglers eventually rejoined the shattered remnants of the regiment. Duffi√© would never again serve with the Army of the Potomac, although he did command cavalry in other Union armies. The Union casualties on July 17 were reported as 250. Fight on June 19 After the Battle of Aldie, Stuart remained on the defensive, wanting to spoil any Federal attempts to force the passes in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Pleasonton tentatively sent probes towards Ashby's and Snicker's Gaps. On June 18, David McM. Gregg ran into Confederate pickets around Middleburg, and Stuart quickly fell back to a commanding ridge west of town. Fearing a trap, a cautious Pleasonton ordered Gregg to withdraw to Aldie. The next day, Gregg again moved against Middleburg, sending the brigade of his first cousin, Col. J. Irvin Gregg, at the Rebels while John Buford's division swung north towards Pot House (New Lisbon). After a flanking march, Buford eventually occupied the ground around Pot House, pushing back two regiments of William \\"Grumble\\" Jones's brigade in a mild skirmish. After a hard fight to clear reinforced pickets from Middleburg, Colonel Gregg was so impressed by the Confederate position on the high ground beyond the town that he asked for support before attacking. Kilpatrick sent two regiments to help extend the Federal line, and Gregg slowly advanced. The temperature hovered around 98 ¬∞F throughout the afternoon, sapping men and horses of energy. A series of Union charges finally forced Stuart's horse artillery to withdraw, and then his cavalry. Several Confederate counterattacks failed to regain control of the ridge. Late in the day, Buford sent the U.S. Reserve Brigade back from Pot House, and the 2nd and 6th U.S. Cavalry regiments seized a hotly contested hill south of the tiny village of Millville as darkness fell. Stuart was forced to abandon his position, falling back along the turnpike to stonewalls beyond a ravine along a stream known as Kirk's Branch. A still cautious Pleasonton refused to follow up his success and ordered his men to rest and send out pickets. Union losses in the June 19 fight were reported as 16 killed, 46 wounded, and 37 missing. Stuart lost perhaps 40 men, including his chief of staff and friend, Prussian cavalier Heros von Borcke, who was badly wounded by a bullet in his neck. Though von Borcke survived and returned to service the following spring, the bullet remained in his body for the rest of his life, and the lingering wound would ultimately result in his death from sepsis in 1895.

In 1856, Johannes Petrus Meyer (better known as Jan Meyer) acquired of his father's Elandsfontein farm and built a house next to the Natalspruit, close to where the civic centre stands today. In 1890, he built a new farmhouse mansion on the opposite end of the farm that was miraculously left unharmed during the Anglo Boer War of 1899‚Äì1902. The homestead can still be seen today from the bypassing N12 freeway. Jan's brother, also Johan Georg (Org) Meyer, took over the farm after Jan's death. General Hendrik Abraham Alberts, a veteran of the Anglo Boer War, purchased a part of the farm from Org in 1904 and named it Alberton. The Afrikaans medium primary school Jan Meyer was named for the original owner of the farm, and the affluent suburb Meyersdal also refers to the family whose original farmhouse mansion still stands on the land behind the Meyersdal koppie. The primary school Generaal Alberts, and Hennie Alberts Avenue in the suburb of Brackenhurst, are named after the town founder. The first official post office was opened in 1926, and in 1938 building work started on a town hall. In the same year, street names in the Alberton North suburb were renamed after Voortrekker leaders to coincide with the 100 year commemoration of the Great Trek. A well-known landmark of the city, ABC STORE, was established in 1943 on Pieter Uys Avenue, Alberton North, and is still trading today as a general store specializing in school uniforms. Geography= Cityscape  The city's initial centre of development was in the area now known as Alberton North or ‚ÄòOld‚Äô Alberton. The original black settlement in Alberton was in the area of the Alberton Dam. During the apartheid era, inhabitants were moved to the surrounding black townships and a 'white' suburb was established around the dam and named Verwoerdpark, after former prime minister Hendrik Verwoerd. Over the years, development sprawled out into adjacent areas, and today Alberton is made up of 19 suburbs stretching over an area of 77 km2. The city, as per South African in whole, is no longer segregated although surrounding black townships (which are now also not exclusively black) still remain.

One of the most notable industries to be established in the town during this time was CJ Fuchs (Pty) Ltd. Venturing into the production of domestic electrical appliances under licence from the American company Westing House Electric International, the business was relocated from central Johnnesburg to a newly built, modern factory in Alrode in 1948. Until the mid-seventies, CJ Fuchs (Pty) Ltd would continue to grow into a multi- million Rand operation, employing thousands of people in several subsidiary companies within the group. After Carl Fuchs' death in April 1976, the company was sold to the then Barlow Rand. In 1973, he was also the first to be admitted as a Freeman of the Town of Alberton. The construction of the Alberton Boulevard was a major development started in the late 1980s with the aim of converting a section of Voortrekker Road that runs past the Alberton City Shopping Mall into a pedestrian-friendly zone. Sports There are many well-established sports facilities and clubs for tennis, rugby, road running, boxing, wrestling, cricket, jukskei, netball, hockey, soccer, bowls, korfball and ring tennis in Alberton. It is also home to the Reading Country Club and Golf Course. Alberton was also home to the now defunct New Market Race Course, which is now a shopping mall. Parks and greenspace Alberton borders on the Klipriviersberg Nature Reserve, located on Peggy Vera Road, Kibler Park, Gauteng (26¬∞18‚Ä≤13‚Ä≥S 28¬∞0‚Ä≤39‚Ä≥E). This reserve is home to many wild animals, including zebra, red hartebeest, porcupines, black wildebeest, otters, blesbok, springbok, duiker and 170 bird species. There are also Iron Age settlements dating from about 1500 and the ruins of a house built in 1850 by voortrekker Sarel Marais.

The surface of an oil pastel painting is less powdery than one made from gum pastels, but more difficult to protect with a fixative. History Portrait of a child made from oil pastels. At the end of World War I, Kanae Yamamoto proposed an overhaul of the Japanese education system. He thought that it had been geared too much towards uncritical absorption of information by imitation and wanted to promote a less restraining system, a vision he expounded in his book Theory of self-expression which described the Jiyu-ga method, \\"learning without a teacher\\". Teachers Rinzo Satake and his brother-in-law Shuku Sasaki read Yamamoto's work and became fanatical supporters. They became keen to implement his ideas by replacing the many hours Japanese children had to spend drawing ideograms with black Indian ink with free drawing hours, filled with as much color as possible. For this, they decided to produce an improved wax crayon and in 1921 founded the Sakura Cray- Pas Company and began production. The new product was not completely satisfactory, as pigment concentration was low and blending was impossible, so in 1924 they decided to develop a high viscosity crayon: the oil pastel. This used a mixture of mashed paraffin wax, stearic acid and coconut oil as a binder. Designed as a relatively cheap, easily applied, colorful medium, oil pastels granted younger artists and students a greater freedom of expression than the expensive chalk-like pastels normally associated with the fine arts. Until the addition of a stabiliser in 1927, oil pastels came in two types: winter pastels with additional oil to prevent hardening and summer pastels with little oil to avoid melting. State schools could not afford the medium and, suspicious of the very idea of \\"self-expression\\" in general, favoured the coloured pencil, a cheaper German invention then widely promoted in Europe as a means to instill work discipline in young children. Oil pastels were an immediate commercial success and other manufacturers were quick to take up the idea, such as Dutch company Talens, who began to produce Panda Pastels in 1930. However, none of these were comparable to the professional quality oil pastels produced today. These early products were intended to introduce western art education to Japanese children, and not as a fine arts medium, although Sakura managed to persuade some avant-garde artists to acquaint themselves with the technique, among them Pablo Picasso. In 1947, Picasso, who for many years had been unable to procure oil pastels because of the war conditions, convinced Henri Sennelier, a French manufacturer who specialized in high quality art products, to develop a fine arts version. In 1949 Sennelier produced the first oil pastels intended for professionals and experienced artists. These were superior in wax viscosity, texture and pigment quality and capable of producing more consistent and attractive work. The Japanese Holbein brand of oil pastels appeared in the mid-1980s with both student and professional grades; the latter with a range of 225 colours. Use Oil pastels can be used directly in dry form; when done lightly, the resulting effects are similar to oil paints. Heavy build-ups can create an almost impasto effect. Once applied to a surface, the oil pastel pigment can be manipulated with a brush moistened in white spirit, turpentine, linseed oil, or another type of vegetable oil or solvent. Alternatively, the drawing surface can be oiled before drawing or the pastel itself can be dipped in oil. Some of these solvents pose serious health concerns. Oil pastels are considered a fast medium because they are easy to paint with and convenient to carry; for this reason they are often used for sketching, but can also be used for sustained works. Because oil pastels never dry out completely, they need to be protected somehow, often by applying a special fixative to the painting or placing the painting in a sleeve and then inside a frame. There are some known durability problems: firstly, as the oil doesn't dry, it keeps permeating the paper. This process degrades both the paper and the colour layer as it reduces the flexibility of the latter. A second problem is that the stearic acid makes the paper brittle. Lastly both the stearic acid and the wax will be prone to efflorescence or \\"wax bloom\\", the building-up of fatty acids and wax on the surface into an opaque white layer. This is easily made transparent again by gentle polishing with a woolen cloth; but the three effects together result in a colour layer consisting mainly of brittle stearic acid on top of brittle paper, a combination that will crumble easily. A long term concern is simple evaporation: palmitic acid is often present and half of it will have evaporated within 40 years; within 140 years half of the stearic acid will have disappeared. Impregnation of the entire art work by beeswax has been evaluated as a conservation measure. Surface and techniques An example of the scraping down technique The surface chosen for oil pastels can have a very dramatic effect on the final painting. Paper is a common surface but this medium can be used on other surfaces including wood, metal, hardboard (often known as \\"masonite\\"), MDF, canvas and glass. Many companies make papers specifically for pastels that are suitable for use with oil pastels. Building up layers of color with the oil pastel, called layering, is a very common technique. Other techniques include underpainting and scraping down or sgraffito. Turpentine, or similar liquids such as mineral spirits, are often used as a blending tool to create a wash effect similar to some watercolor paintings. Commercially available oil sketching papers are preferred for such technique. Grades A blended picture using mineral spirits and oil pastels There are a number of types of oil pastels, each of which can be classified as either scholastic, student or professional grade. Scholastic grade is the lowest grade; generally the oil pastels are harder and less vibrant than higher grades. It is generally meant for children or new users of oil pastels, and is fairly inexpensive compared to other grades. The middle grade, student grade, is meant for art students and is softer and more vibrant than scholastic grade. They are usually more expensive. Professional grade is the highest grade of oil pastel, and are also the softest and most vibrant, but can be very expensive. See also * Oil stick ReferencesFurther reading * Leslie, Kenneth.

Fran√ßois Leguat (1637/1639 ‚Äì September 1735) was a French explorer and naturalist. He was one of a small group of male French Protestant refugees who in 1691 settled on the then uninhabited island of Rodrigues in the western Indian Ocean. The colonists became discontented with their life on the island and after a stay of two years managed to escape to Mauritius in a small boat. Leguat arrived back in Europe in June 1698 and wrote a book recounting his adventures which was published in 1708. In his book Leguat describes several species of birds and tortoises that were endemic to Rodrigues but are now extinct. Life Fran√ßois Leguat was a French Huguenot originating from the Province of Bresse, now part of the department of Ain, who fled to Holland in 1689 after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. Marquis Henri du Quesne had published a book giving a glowing description of the island of R√©union and, with the cooperation of the Dutch East India Company, was planning to establish a colony of French Protestant refugees on the island. Two ships were charted for the purpose and many refugees, including Leguat, were eager to become colonists, but when du Quesne learned that France had sent a squadron of ships to the island, he abandoned this plan as he wanted to avoid any confrontation with the French. Instead he fitted out a small frigate, L'Hirondelle and instructed the captain, Anthony Valleau, to reconnoitre the Mascarene islands, and to take possession of whatever island was found unoccupied and suitable for colonisation. It appears that the colonists were not informed of this change of plan. On 10 July 1690 Leguat and nine male volunteers boarded L'Hirondelle in Amsterdam, intending to start a new life on the island of R√©union, which they believed had been abandoned by the French. Instead, on 16 May 1691, Leguat and seven companions were marooned on the uninhabited island of Rodrigues. Fran√ßois Leguat's map of his settlement on Rodrigues. Rodrigues solitaires can be seen sprinkled all over the map After spending a year on the island the group became homesick and set about constructing a wooden boat to allow them to escape to the island of Mauritius, then under Dutch control. The first attempt failed when they struck Rodrigues' reef; one of the party subsequently died from some illness (possibly brought about by contact with some poisonous reef fauna). They finally left Rodrigues on 21 May 1693 and spent a week being carried by the prevailing wind and current in their open boat to Mauritius, a distance of 300 nautical miles (560 km). They were initially well received by the Governor of the island, Rodolfo Diodati, but after an argument over a piece of ambergris that one of the group had brought from Rodrigues, and the discovery by the Governor of their plan to steal a dinghy and escape to R√©union, five of the party were put in prison. Relations were probably strained by the fact that France and Holland were on opposite sides in the Nine Years' War (1688‚Äì97). In February 1694 they were transferred to a tiny islet some distance from the shore and kept under abhorrent conditions. One of the group died in attempting to escape; he seems to have reached Mauritius' mainland with a crude float, but apparently perished in the woods too. Finally, in September 1696 the remaining members of the group were transferred to Batavia and brought before the Dutch Council where they were found to be innocent. Leguat and the two other survivors arrived back in Europe in June 1698. Leguat appears to have settled in England and spent the rest of his life there. He died in September 1735, in London. Works Leguat published a description of his adventures in 1708 when he was around 70 years old. The full French title was: Voyage et avantures de Fran√ßois Leguat et de ses compagnons, en deux isles d√©sertes des Indes orientales : avec la relation des choses les plus remarquables qu'ils ont observ√©es dans l'isle Maurice, √† Batavia, au Cap de Bon Esp√©rance, dans l'isle de Sainte H√©l√®ne, et en d'autres endroits de leur route. Le tout enrichi de cartes et de figures. The French edition was published in both London and Amsterdam. An English translation with the title A New Voyage to the East-Indies was published in London and a Dutch edition in Utrecht. Some of the text is very similar to passages found in works by Maximilien Misson, another French Huguenot living in exile. It appears that either Leguat copied Misson or, more likely, Misson assisted Leguat with the book and wrote the preface. The book is notable in containing Leguat's natural history observations on the now extinct fauna of Rodrigues including the Rodrigues solitaire, the Rodrigues rail, the domed and the saddle-backed Rodrigues giant tortoises and Newton's parakeet.

Background The Union cavalry made a determined effort to pierce Confederate Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart's cavalry screen. Stuart had been fighting a series of delaying actions in the Loudoun Valley, hoping to keep Union General Alfred Pleasonton's cavalry from discovering the location of the main body of Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, much of which was in the Shenandoah Valley just west of the small village of Upperville. Stuart had slowed the Federals in fighting at Aldie and Battle of Middleburg, using ravines, creeks, and stonewalls to his advantage as he slowly withdrew westward. He made another determined stand near Upperville and succeeded in preventing the Federal cavalry from entering the Shenandoah Valley. Goose Creek Following the fighting at Middleburg on June 19, a heavy rainstorm during the night had soaked the Loudoun Valley, ending a six-week drought. In the downpour, Wade Hampton's brigade of Confederate cavalry had reinforced J.E.B. Stuart, and was deployed near Beverly Robertson's brigade along the Ashby's Gap Turnpike. John R. Chambliss's brigade moved northward and joined \\"Grumble\\" Jones near Unison, Virginia. Thomas T. Munford's brigade was still farther north, guarding access to the Snickersville Gap. John Mosby's partisan rangers scouted the Union positions and provided much needed intelligence on their movements. Union cavalry commander Alfred Pleasonton, frustrated by Stuart's excellent usage of dismounted cavalry hiding behind stone walls, on June 20 asked for and received infantry support from Maj. Gen. George G. Meade's V Corps. Pleasonton had still not located Lee's main body, a task that the War Department continued to prod him to accomplish. Trying to maneuver Stuart out of position, Pleasonton sent Judson Kilpatrick's brigade along the Ashby's Gap Turnpike, supported by Col. Strong Vincent's brigade of infantry, with David McM. Gregg's cavalry division in reserve. John Buford's division would try to turn the flank. U.S. Route 50, east of Upperville. Stuart, determined to rest his weary men on the Sabbath, did not get his wish, as Federal artillery opened up on his position around 8:00 a.m. on June 21. After initially holding off Kilpatrick's cavalry, Stuart, effectively using stone walls and steep ravines and creeks, began to fall back under pressure from the Union infantry. He made a stand west of the hamlet of Rector's Crossroads along the stone bridge over Goose Creek, where for two more hours he was able to withstand repeated Federal attacks from mounted cavalry, as well as the 16th Michigan Infantry, which sent skirmishers and sharpshooters forward to pick off the Confederate gunners. Ahead of the advancing Union soldiers, the Confederate artillerymen hooked up their guns to their teams and raced off, but a Blakely Rifle flipped over as its crew hurried to get away. The gun was captured, the first artillery piece ever lost by Stuart's cavalry. However, with two of his three remaining guns soon also disabled, Stuart withdrew and headed westward toward Upperville, still fighting delaying actions where favorable. Upperville John Buford's Federal column had detoured to attack the new Confederate left flank near Upperville, while J. Irvin Gregg's and Judson Kilpatrick's brigades advanced from the east along the Ashby's Gap Turnpike. Buford soon encountered \\"Grumble\\" Jones and Chambliss's Confederate brigades, escorting Stuart's supply train just north of Upperville, and attacked. Meanwhile, Kilpatrick's troopers attacked Hampton and Robertson on a ridgeline east of Upperville known as Vineyard Hill. Some of the Union cavalrymen made it as far as the village before being repulsed. After furious mounted fighting, Stuart finally withdrew to take a strong defensive position in Ashby's Gap, even as Confederate infantry began crossing the Potomac River into Maryland. As cavalry skirmishing diminished in the next few days, Stuart made the fateful decision to strike east and make a circuit of the Union army as it marched toward Gettysburg. Upperville was significant in that Stuart's successful delaying tactics prevented Pleasonton from making an accurate assessment of the location of Lee's infantry divisions, thereby depriving the Federals of much valued intelligence of their enemy's whereabouts and objectives.

Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, Balby is within the Doncaster Central constituency and contains the electoral wards Balby South and Hexthorpe and Balby North. Housing stock ranging from terraced housing nearer to Doncaster town centre and post-war suburbs to the south west. There are several new housing developments, including, Woodfield Plantation which is part of an attempt to regenerate the area following deindustrialization. Economic activity is still centred on heavy industry, especially around the Carr Hill Industrial Estate, home to Bridon, a large rope manufacturer. History The earliest written reference to Balby occurs in the Domesday Book (1086), which records the name as Balle(s)bi. This almost certainly derives from a personal name, Bal, together with the Old Norse word b√Ωr (meaning a farm) ‚Äì dating the foundation of Balby to some time in the period of Viking settlement, between the late 8th and early 11th centuries. Balby (which then included Warmsworth), was home to several of the early followers of the Quaker faith in England, including Thomas Aldham, whose son William was instrumental in opening the first permanent meeting house in the area, in Quaker Lane, Warmsworth. Balby has long been associated, along with other areas of Doncaster, with having a large Quaker community. More recently, the suburban town was a centre for steel and brass manufacture, especially at the well-known Pegler's Brass Foundry and Bridon Ropery. In the early 20th century, St Catherine's Hospital was built in the south of Balby, near to the site of St Catherine's Well, an ancient site of healing and pilgrimage. It is now a hospital estate. Education Astrea Academy Woodfields is the only secondary school in the Balby area. Balby Central Primary Academy, Carr Lodge Academy, Mallard Primary School, St Francis Xavier Catholic Primary School, Waverley Primary Academy and Woodfield Primary School are the primary schools in Balby. Sycamore Hall Preparatory School is an independent primary and there is also specialist provision at Maple Medical PRU, incorporating Hospital Tuition, the Young Parents Centre/Link/JASP and the Mulberry unit.  Amenities  Potteric Carr Nature Reserve is a natural wetland near the Lakeside development.

It is the ninth book published and eleventh chronologically in the Redwall series. The American edition of the novel was published simply as Pearls of Lutra.  Plot summary  When gathering herbs near the quarry in Mossflower Woods, the young Redwallers Tansy and Arven come across a mysterious skeleton among the rocks. They are disoriented in a rainstorm and after failing to return to the abbey before the breaking of the storm are rescued by Martin II, son of Mattimeo and grandson of Matthias. Tansy quickly leads curious Redwallers back to the quarry to examine the mysterious skeleton, and along the way, they meet two travellers: the irrepressible hare Cleckstarr Lepus Montisle and his owl friend Gerul. Meanwhile, far across the western sea on the tropical isle of Sampetra, trouble is brewing. Ublaz Mad-Eyes, a large, sinewy pine marten with a hypnotic stare, gathers an army of barbaric monitor lizards and trident-wielding searats. The stoat captain Conva is sent out to retrieve the Tears of All Oceans, six perfectly spherical rose-pink pearls, but after murdering the Holt Lutra who owned the pearls, the Tears are stolen by the weasel Graylunk, who flees into Mossflower Woods. Conva tracks him to Redwall Abbey, where Graylunk takes refuge, before returning to Sampetra. US cover of Pearls of Lutra Ublaz is not pleased and murders Conva. He then sends out an elite force of monitor lizards, headed by their general Lask Frildur, to Mossflower to retrieve the pearls. They are escorted by the ferret captain Romsca and her crew. However, the daughter of the Lutra chieftain is not dead. Far away on the western shores, Grath Longfletch, a strong female otter, was at the gates of the Dark Forest before being found by a pair of bankvoles, who nurse her back to health. The otter fashions a powerful bow and a quiver of green-fletched arrows, with which she planned on wreaking her revenge. She eliminates a longboat-crew of searats and then takes their boat southward into Mossflower, where she hopes to find the corsairs that slew her family. Presently, Conva's brother Barranca discovers that Ublaz has killed his brother, and he begins hatching a plan to overthrow the pine marten and take the island for himself. With the fearsome Lask and his lizards gone to Mossflower, Barranca decides to seize his chance. Back at Redwall, the old bankvole recorder Rollo determines that the skeleton in the quarry was Graylunk. He had become gravely injured in a fight with the weasel Flairnose, whom he killed, over the pearls before seeking safety at Redwall. There he befriended an old squirrel called Sister Fermald before he went off to die in the woods. Fermald, a clever, though senile old beast, had expertly hidden the pearls throughout the abbey before passing away several seasons ago. Tansy, Rollo, and Martin II, along with the hedgehog maid's friends Craklyn the squirrel and Piknim the mouse, begin a search for the six exquisite pearls. The Dibbun Arven and his two partners in crime, the moles Diggum and Gurrbowl, occasionally help in the search. When Abbot Durral takes young Viola Bankvole for a stroll in Mossflower Woods, they are captured by Lask and his troops. Lask binds the Abbot and the bankvole and attempts to ransom them for the pearls at Redwall. However, the pearls have not yet been found, and Lask and his lizards take the two Redwallers back to their ship to be captives at Sampetra. Martin, Clecky, Gerul, and the Skipper of Otters pursue the lizards through Mossflower, slaying several but failing to rescue the captives. Gerul and Skipper become wounded and are sent back to the Abbey, but the others chase the lizards to the western shore. There, they meet up with the GUOSSSIM and Grath Longfletch, who had caught sight of Romsca's ship, the Waveworm, and attempted to pick off some of the vermin. Durral manages to help Viola get to safety on the shore, but the ship departs before he can escape. Viola is sent back to Redwall with two shrews to guide her, and Grath, Clecky, Martin, and the Log-a-Log's two sons use discarded vermin boats to form the Freebeast, a double-outrigger vessel in which they pursue Lask to Sampetra. Viola, who has sneaked aboard, also ends up coming along. On Sampetra, Barranca has been slain by Rasconza, a clever fox corsair who takes over the rebellion against Ublaz. Initial attempts at negotiation fail, due to the double-dealing of the pair, and when Ublaz tries to have Rasconza assassinated, Sampetra is plunged into all-out war. Ublaz's trident-rats, led by his general Sagitar, desert him and switch to Rasconza's side, but they are unable to take Ublaz's fortress, which is still held by his monitor lizards. Under siege, Ublaz decides to hold out until Lask Frildur returns with reinforcements. In the search for the six pearls, the Redwaller friends slowly but surely find them all, though not without paying the price. The young mouse Piknim ends up being slain by the cruel jackdaws at St. Ninian's while searching for a pearl. The church is burnt down to prevent evil-doers from ever using it again (it had been used as a base by Redwall's enemies twice before in Redwall and Mattimeo), and the search resumes, with all the pearls eventually being found. Martin, Grath and their friends closely follow Romsca and Lask across the ocean, and end up meeting the otters of Holt Ruddaring along the way. Inbar Trueflight, another skilled otter archer, and the seal Hawm tag along on the quest. On the Waveworm, Durral is underfed and mistreated, but the ferret captain Romsca protects him from the fierce violence and hunger of Lask's cruel monitor lizards. Lask and Romsca, who had been at odds with one another since the beginning, finally battle on deck, with the forces of both being wiped out. Romsca ends up slaying Lask but is fatally injured in the process. Before dying, she gives the Abbot instructions on how to set the rudder to fix the ship toward Sampetra. As the last living creature aboard the ship, the old Abbot sails alone toward the evil isle. By the time the ship arrives, he is so weak from hunger and thirst that he is hallucinating; Ublaz, furious that the reinforcements he was waiting for are dead, takes the Abbot hostage. When Martin, Clecky, Grath, Inbar, the shrews and Viola arrive on Sampetra, a battle ensues. Suspecting Sagitar and her trident-rats have betrayed him, Rasconza mortally wounds her, but she manages to kill him before dying herself, leaving the corsairs leaderless. Most of the monitor lizards and wave-vermin are killed, and Martin corners Ublaz alone in the caverns below his palace. They duel it out, but after wounding Martin, Ublaz accidentally steps on a poisonous coral snake (which he had hypnotised and kept as a pet to intimidate his enemies). The snake bites him, and he dies. Durral is rescued and the warriors all return to Mossflower. They leave the island of Sampetra with no timber for ship building to force the vermin to learn to live in harmony with each other. Grath stays with Inbar at Holt Ruddaring, as the pair have fallen in love, but the others meet Tansy and her friends at the shore. The young hedgehog, realising the pearls lead only to greed and violence and bring nothing but misery and death to all who own them, casts them out into the sea to be forever lost. For her hard work, perseverance and aptitude, Tansy is made Abbess of Redwall to succeed old Durral. She becomes the first non-mouse abbot/abbess.

Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart's Confederate cavalry, which was riding north to get around the Union Army of the Potomac, attacked a Federal cavalry regiment, driving it through the streets of Hanover. Brig. Gen. Elon Farnsworth's brigade arrived and counterattacked, routing the Confederate vanguard and nearly capturing Stuart himself. Stuart soon counterattacked. Reinforced by Brig. Gen. George A. Custer's Michigan Brigade, Farnsworth held his ground, and a stalemate ensued. Stuart was forced to continue north and east to get around the Union cavalry, further delaying his attempt to rejoin Robert E. Lee's army, which was then concentrating at Cashtown Gap west of Gettysburg. Background As Robert E. Lee moved his Army of Northern Virginia northward in June 1863 through the Shenandoah Valley towards Pennsylvania, portions of his cavalry under J.E.B. Stuart slipped eastward across the path of the Union Army of the Potomac. A series of raids in eastern Maryland netted prisoners and supplies, as well as disrupting Federal communications and telegraph lines. However, Stuart was not in position to effectively screen Lee's advance or to provide intelligence on the movements of the Federal army. As Stuart headed north in an effort to link with Lee, Union cavalry commander Maj. Gen. Alfred Pleasonton, riding towards Pennsylvania to the west of Stuart, ordered his divisions to fan out across a wide swath, keeping an eye out for Confederates. Brig. Gen. Judson Kilpatrick's division was on the Union right flank. The majority of his men passed through Hanover early in the morning of June 30, pausing briefly for refreshments and to receive the greetings of the jubilant townspeople. Their town had been raided three days before by Confederate Lt. Col. Elijah V. White's cavalry, attached to Maj. Gen. Jubal Early's division that had occupied York County. White's Virginians and Marylanders had followed the railroad to Hanover from nearby Gettysburg, and taken horses, food, supplies, clothing, shoes, and other desired items from the townspeople, often paying with valueless Confederate money or drafts on the Confederate government. White's raiders had destroyed the area's telegraph wires, cutting off communications with the outside world, before sacking the nearby Hanover Junction train station. The unexpected arrival of Kilpatrick's column was a pleasant surprise to the residents of Hanover, who warmly greeted the Union troopers with food and drink. Most of Kilpatrick's men remounted and passed through town, heading northward through the nearby Pigeon Hills towards Abbottstown. He left behind a small rear guard force to picket the roads south and west of Hanover. In the meantime, Stuart had left his billet at Shriver's Corner, Maryland, and was proceeding northward across the Mason‚ÄìDixon line into Pennsylvania. Hearing that Federal cavalry had been spotted near his intended destination, Littlestown, Pennsylvania, he instead turned towards Hanover in adjacent York County. His progress was slowed considerably by a cumbersome train of over 125 heavily laden supply wagons that he had captured near Rockville, Maryland. In addition, he had skirmished with Delaware cavalry on June 29 at Westminster, Maryland, further delaying him. Battle Map of Hanover Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. Shortly before 10:00 a.m. on June 30, the rear guard of the 18th Pennsylvania Cavalry encountered Confederate videttes about three miles (5 km) southwest of Hanover at Gitt's Mill. In the ensuing exchange of small arms fire, a Confederate cavalryman died and several were wounded. Shortly afterwards, 25 men from Company G of the 18th Pennsylvania were captured by the 13th Virginia from John R. Chambliss‚Äôs brigade, the vanguard of Stuart's oncoming cavalry. Also that morning, a series of minor engagements occurred near Littlestown and elsewhere along Stuart's path.Krepps, pp. 15-20. Southwest of Hanover at a tiny hamlet now known as Pennville, the 2nd North Carolina Cavalry struck the 18th Pennsylvania‚Äôs main column and split it in two. Union survivors retired in disorder through the streets of Hanover just as Stuart's horse artillery arrived, unlimbered, and opened fire. As the Confederates occupied the town in the wake of the fleeing Pennsylvanians, General Farnsworth wheeled the 5th New York Cavalry into position near the town commons and attacked the Rebel flank in the streets, forcing the Tar Heels to abandon their brief hold on the town. The commander of the 2nd North Carolina, William Henry Fitzhugh Payne, was captured after his dying horse pitched him into a nearby tanning vat. A Union soldier pulled Payne out and took him prisoner. As more of Chambliss's men (and General Stuart) arrived on the scene, they were met by additional Federals near the sprawling Karle Forney farm, just south of Hanover. Nearly surrounded in the confused fighting, Stuart and a staff officer made their escape cross-country through the hedges bordering the country lane, at one point leaping their horses over a wide ditch. Hearing the unmistakable sound of distant gunfire, Judson Kilpatrick raced southward towards Hanover, with his horse dying in the town square from the severe ride. The young general began to deploy his men in and around Hanover, barricading some streets with barrels, farm wagons, dry goods boxes, and anything else that might provide cover. Shortly before noon, fighting at the Forney farm ceased as the Rebels broke off contact. Kilpatrick positioned Custer's newly arrived brigade on the farm and awaited developments. When Fitzhugh Lee's Virginia brigade arrived, Stuart moved his and Chambliss's men into a new position on a ridge extending from the Keller Farm southwest of Hanover to Mount Olivet Cemetery southeast of town. Meantime, Kilpatrick repositioned the brigades of the newly promoted duo of Custer and Farnsworth to form a better defensive perimeter and then brought up his guns. Leaving the captured wagons two miles (3 km) south of town under heavy guard, Wade Hampton at 2 p.m. brought his brigade and Breathed's Battery into position near the Mount Olivet Cemetery on the extreme right of Stuart's line. An artillery duel ensued for the better part of two hours as opposing cannons hurtled shells over the town. Fragments blasted holes in several houses and narrowly missed killing Mrs. Henry Winebrenner and her daughter, who had just left their balcony when a projectile came hurtling through the upstairs. During the prolonged artillery exchange, Custer's dismounted 6th Michigan moved forward to within of Chambliss and the two guns supporting his line. Flanked and losing fifteen men as prisoners, the Wolverines tried again and succeeded in securing the Littlestown-Frederick Road, opening a line of communication with the Union XII Corps. Stuart and Kilpatrick made no further aggressive moves, and both sides initiated a series of skirmishes and minor probing actions. Aftermath Disengaging slowly and protecting his captured wagons, Stuart withdrew to the northeast through Jefferson towards York, known from recent newspapers to be the location of Early's division. En route, Stuart heard at New Salem that Early's Division had recently left York and marched northwestly through Dover. Stuart changed course and headed northward through the night on winding, hilly country roads, still trying to locate Early or Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell, thinking the latter still to be towards the Susquehanna River. The head of Stuart's seventeen-mile (27 km) long column arrived in Dover at 2:00 a.m. on the morning of July 1, with the rear guard there by 8:00 a.m.Civil War commemorative marker, Dover Fire Hall, erected by the citizens of Dover in November 1907. Stuart learned that Early had passed through town and was heading westward towards Shippensburg as the army concentrated. Stuart paroled over 200 Union prisoners and gave his troopers a much needed six-hour rest (while, unknown to Stuart, Maj. Gen. Henry Heth's Confederate infantry division collided with Brig. Gen. John Buford's Union cavalry at Gettysburg). Stuart resumed his exhausting march through the afternoon and early evening, seizing over 1,000 fresh horses from York County farmers.York County Civil War Damage Claims, Pennsylvania State Archives, Harrisburg, PA. Leaving Hampton's Brigade and the wagons at Dillsburg, Stuart headed for Carlisle, hoping to find Ewell. Instead, Stuart found nearly 3,000 Pennsylvania and New York militia occupying the borough. After lobbing a few shells into town during the early evening and burning the Carlisle Barracks, Stuart withdrew after midnight to the south towards Gettysburg (see Skirmish at Carlisle). The fighting at Hanover, the long march through York County with the captured wagons, and the brief encounter at Carlisle slowed Stuart considerably in his attempt to rejoin the main army and locate Lee. The \\"eyes and ears\\" of the Army of Northern Virginia had failed Lee. Losses at Hanover were relatively light in terms of casualties, but the cost in time in delaying Stuart from linking with Lee proved to be even more costly. Estimates vary as to the number of men lost at Hanover; Union losses in one source are listed as 19 killed, 73 wounded, and 123 missing (for a total of 215). The 18th Pennsylvania had suffered the most, with three men killed, 24 wounded, and 57 missing. On the Confederate side, Stuart's losses are generally estimated as 9 dead, 50 wounded, and 58 missing, for a total of 117.Hanover Historical Society, Pennsylvania Room, vertical files, Battle of Hanover. The battlefield today The fighting in Hanover is commemorated by \\"The Picket,\\" an impressive bronze statue of a mounted cavalryman sculpted by famed Boston artist Cyrus E. Dallin. Paid for by the state of Pennsylvania, it was erected in 1905 in the center square.1906 Year Book of the Pennsylvania Society of New York, p. 150. Two bronze plaques installed by the Federal government in 1901 bear inscriptions relating to the movements of the Army of the Potomac on June 30 and July 1, 1863. In addition, a small number of artillery pieces are located on the town's square, including serial number 1 of the Parrott Rifle-- the original barrel, mounted on a reproduction carriage. A wall plaque on a modern building and a star surrounded by four horseshoes installed in the sidewalk mark the location of Custer's headquarters and the \\"Custer Maple,\\" a prominent tree used by the boy general to tether his horse. In 2005, the borough erected over a dozen wayside markers at key spots along the city streets to help interpret the battle for visitors, and three years later the state added its own markers as part of the Pennsylvania Civil War Trails initiative. However, much of the open area south of town, including the Forney farm where Custer advanced, has been lost to modern development, as has the once open hills a half-mile north of Hanover Center Square where Kilpatrick's artillery deployed. Elder's Battery of four cannons was deployed along what is now Stock Street east of Carlisle Street and Pennington's Battery was deployed along what is now 4th Street west of Carlisle Street. The York County Heritage Trust and some local Hanover organizations sponsor guided tours of the battle sites. NotesReferences * Anthony, William. Anthony's History of the Battle of Hanover.

Although a single decoration, there were two versions of the Spanish Campaign Medal, one for men of the United States Army and another for the forces of the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps. The Army medal was designed by Francis Davis Millet while the Navy and Marines medals were designed by Rudolf Freund (1878-1960) of Bailey, Banks & Biddle. Early versions of the Spanish Campaign Medal suspended the medal from a gold and red ribbon, but this design was changed in 1913 upon request from Spain that a United States service medal not bear the colors of the Spanish nation.Spanish Campaign Medal Red and Yellow The new medal was suspended from a blue and yellow ribbon. Separate medallions existed for both the Navy and Army. Marine Corps recipients received the Navy version with the seal of the United States Marine Corps on the reverse of the medal. The only device authorized to the Spanish Campaign Medal was the Citation Star and then only for U.S. Army recipients of the decoration. Army version The Army version of the Spanish Campaign Medal was established on 12 January 1905. It was awarded for military service performed between 11 May and 16 August 1898 which such service in the geographical regions of either Cuba, Puerto Rico, or the Philippine Islands. For those men of the Army who had served on active duty during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, but had not been deployed in action, a separate medal was established in 1918, known as the Spanish War Service Medal.US Army Institute of Heraldry: Spanish Campaign Medal Navy version The Navy version of the Spanish Campaign Medal was created in June 1908 and issued to any man of either the Navy or Marine Corps who had served in the Philippine Islands between the dates of 1 May and 16 August 1898.

Named for Prince Chichibu, the late brother of Emperor Hirohito, the venue is used mostly for rugby sevens and rugby union matches. It will be demolished. The space will be used for a parking lot for the 2020 Summer Olympics, after the olympics a new baseball stadium will be built where Chichibunomiya stood in order to replace Meiji Jingu Stadium, since Meiji will be also demolished. The space of old baseball stadium will be used to build a replacement rugby ground. Facilities The stadium currently can accommodate 27,188 spectators, but only part of the stands are covered. A large electronic scoreboard was added to the grounds as a step toward modernization before the fifth Rugby World Cup in 2003. On April 19, 2007, it was announced that the stadium was to be equipped with lights for night games by the end of July, to assist with the RWC 2015 bid. The first rugby game under lights was Japan v Asian Barbarians in August 2007, the send- off for Japan going to RWC 2007. Since then it has been used for the first Top League game of the 2007‚Äì8 season between Suntory Sungoliath and Toshiba Brave Lupus, also played under lights and won 10‚Äì3 by the former on October 26, 2008. History Originally completed in 1947, it was at first called Tokyo Rugby Stadium. In 1953 the name was changed to Chichibunomiya Rugby Stadium. The stadium also served as a venue for football matches in the 1964 Summer Olympics. The name Chichibunomiya commemorates the sporting prince, Prince Chichibu, who was not a rugby union player but was passionately fond of the sport and died in 1953. A statue of the prince in a rugby uniform was erected at the stadium. On February 3, 2008, snow prevented two Top League games being played in the 13th and final round of the fifth season. They were postponed to February 9. From 2012 through 2015, the stadium hosted the Japan Sevens, a newly created event on the circuit for men's national rugby sevens teams now known as the World Rugby Sevens Series. When inaugurated, the tournament was the seventh on the circuit schedule, and was held in late March/early April. After the 2014‚Äì15 series, Japan was removed from the schedule in favor of a return to former series host Singapore. From 2016, it has been used as the home ground for the Sunwolves Super Rugby team, along with Singapore National Stadium. In 2019 the Meiji Jingu Gaien, the Japan Sports Council, Mitsui Fudosan and Itochu Corp. groups agreed to redevelop both the Jingu stadium and the Prince Chichibu Memorial Rugby Ground.

He was a prominent figure in the Labour Party in North East England, such that he was nicknamed Mr Newcastle.\\"Southern Discomfort\\" (leading article), The Times, 3 August 1993. Smith sought to clear Newcastle of slum housing and put a great deal of effort into regeneration plans, suggesting that the city should become \\"The Brasilia of the North\\". He also supported the expansion of higher education in Newcastle and funded local arts institutions. Among the developments Smith's council participated in were the Eldon Square Shopping Centre, Newcastle Civic Centre and Swan House. The last led to the demolition of John Dobson's Royal Arcade, though Smith's council had planned to rebuild it nearby. Smith's legacy became associated with the destruction of historic buildings in favour of unpopular concrete structures, though the key developments happened mainly under other council leaders. After leaving the council leadership, Smith ran a public relations firm and formed business links with architect John Poulson. This led to his trial for accepting bribes in April 1974. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six years' imprisonment. In Smith's later life he campaigned for prisoners' issues and continued to comment on public affairs. He starred in a film of his life released in 1987. Early life Smith was born in Wallsend, the son of a Durham miner. His father drank heavily and was a gambler. His mother worked long hours cleaning the Wallsend telephone exchange and washing floors at the Shell-Mex office. He attended Western Boys School in Wallsend and became a printer's apprentice at the age of 14. After a period of unemployment he founded his own painting and decorating business in 1937. During the economically difficult years of the 1930s, he grew his business painting cinema exteriors across Tyneside. Both his parents were communists and Smith adopted left-wing opinions himself. During World War II, Smith registered as a conscientious objector and was initially active in opposing the war and organising strikes against it; he supported the war after the German invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941. During the war, Smith joined several left-wing organisations. He was a regional representative for the Independent Labour Party in 1943, and later joined the Revolutionary Communist Party where he led a shipyard strike. By 1945, he was a member of the Labour Party and in 1950 he was elected to Newcastle City Council as a Labour member representing the Walker ward. He became chairman of the Labour Group in 1953. It was around this time that he began using his first initial in his name, after an incident at Newcastle Airport when he was confused with another person called Dan Smith. Council leadership When the Labour Party won the 1958 local elections and took control of Newcastle, Smith was appointed Chairman of the Housing Committee. He was elected as Leader of the City Council in 1959, and created one of the country's first free-standing Planning Departments and made it the most powerful department in the council. As Leader he instituted a personality-based leadership, creating an 'inner Cabinet' of his own supporters. So influential did Smith become that Lord Hailsham was sent up to Newcastle by the Conservative cabinet to try to counter him. Smith was enthusiastic about town planning and the arts as means of improving the quality of life. He believed strongly in improving Newcastle's housing stock and put a great deal of effort into regeneration plans developed by his chief planning officer Wilfred Burns, suggesting that the city be nicknamed \\"The Brasilia of the North\\". Smith's council also began the planning for Eldon Square Shopping Centre, which would be completed in 1977, on plans drawn up in 1972, by Taylor Chapman and Partners. Other projects he supported included cleaning up the River Tyne and obtaining listed status for the Grainger-town area of Newcastle and the city walls, and the expansion of Newcastle International Airport, which was completed in 1967. Redevelopment was concentrated in the eastern part of the city centre, which had until then been occupied by 18th and 19th century housing. The streetscape design favoured a strong segregation between traffic and pedestrians. The plans also favoured the preservation of the historic core around Grey Street. Though it continued under subsequent councils, the development was left substantially incomplete. Smith continued to run his painting business, which employed 250 by 1965. In 1962, he established a public relations firm to support redevelopment of other urban centres in the north-east, and later nationwide. This company formed links with John Poulson, an architect keen for the business and known for paying those who could supply it. Smith eventually received ¬£156,000 from Poulson for his work, which typically involved signing up local councillors on to the payroll of his companies and getting them to push their councils to accept Poulson's prepackaged redevelopment schemes. Poulson earned more than ¬£1,000,000 through Smith, who regarded him as the \\"best architect Britain ever produced.\\" Poulson did not design any buildings in Newcastle, and there is no evidence of corruption during Smith time as head of Newcastle's council. He attracted criticism from fellow Labour Party members for his extravagant spending, driving a Jaguar with the private plate \\"DAN 68\\", educating his children privately and purchasing a pied-√†-terre in St James's, London. Smith was a political contemporary and ally of North East Labour stalwart Andy Cunningham, who was also brought down by the Poulson scandal and served a jail sentence. Political advancement On the day after the 1964 general election, Smith waited for what he thought would be a certain phone call to invite him to become a cabinet minister in Harold Wilson's government. However, Wilson had a vague suspicion of Smith, and Smith's alliance with the more moderate side of the Labour Party meant that no such invitation was made. In early 1965, George Brown appointed Smith as chairman of the Northern Economic Planning Council, an advisory body. He resigned his council leadership to take this post, and served in it until 1970. Smith was also to serve on the Buchanan Committee on traffic management and the Redcliffe-Maud Commission on local government. On the latter he promoted a scheme whereby England would be divided into five provinces with wide devolution, making Manchester the capital of the North province with 17,000,000 people. He was a member of the Royal Commission on Local Government in England from 1966 to 1969 and was chairman of the Peterlee and Aycliffe Development Corporation from 1968 to 1970. Corruption trials Smith's PR firm was involved with Wandsworth Borough Council in pushing a redevelopment scheme, where its contact was Alderman Sidney Sporle. Sporle fell under police suspicion of corruption in the late 1960s and an inquiry led to Smith being charged with bribery in January 1970. Although acquitted at trial in July 1971, Smith was forced to resign all his political offices. Poulson's company was declared bankrupt in 1972. The subsequent hearings disclosed extensive bribery and in October 1973 Smith was again arrested on corruption charges. At his trial, it was claimed that he had received ¬£156,000 over seven years, usually in the form of payment to his public relations company. He pleaded guilty in 1974 and was sentenced to six years' imprisonment; despite his plea he continued to assert his innocence. After prison While in prison, Smith became involved in amateur dramatics where he met and encouraged Leslie Grantham to pursue his career as a professional. After his release, Grantham was to later star in the BBC soap opera EastEnders. On release from Leyhill Open Prison in 1977 Smith attempted to rebuild a political career, but was initially refused re-admission to the Labour Party. He worked for the Howard League for Penal Reform and campaigned for the rights of released prisoners, and occasionally commented on municipal housing issues. In 1985 he wrote that \\"Thatcherism, in an odd sort of way, could reasonably be described as legalised Poulsonism. Contributions to Tory Party funds will be repaid by the handing over of public assets for private gain.\\" In 1987, he was readmitted into the Labour Party. By 1990 he was a member of the executive committee of the Newcastle Tenants Association, and living on the 14th floor of Mill House, a tower block in the Spital Tongues area of the City. Smith died of a suspected heart attack on 27 July 1993, in the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne. He had undergone surgery after collapsing at home.  Personal life  Smith was married to Ada (1919‚Äì2018) from 1939 until his death. He was the father of three children, a son and two daughters. Legacy Smith was remembered for the personality and charisma he showed during his political career. He has been praised for championing North East England at a time when the region was in decline. Among his well-regarded achievements are slum clearance, helping establish an independent Newcastle University and modernising the local administration. Conversely, few defend his ethical conduct in the corruption case, although biographer Chris Foote Wood argues that Smith was treated unfairly and that the scandal was mainly the fault of Poulson. Jeremy Beecham, a later leader of Newcastle City Council, argued that the corruption scandal had overshadowed the positive aspects of Smith's legacy. He praised Smith's charisma, vision, role in creating Eldon Square Shopping Centre and reforms to the local government, though he believed Smith made mistakes with his conduct and the demolition of certain historic buildings. The loss of John Dobson's Royal Arcade in 1963-64 and Old Eldon Square became particularly symbolic, although the Smith council had planned to rebuild the former. Owen Hatherley writes that in addition to being overly car-centred, \\"The problem with the idea of the Brasilia of the North is that Newcastle never found a northern Oscar Niemeyer.\\" John Shipley, another council leader, said that \\"his plan to turn Newcastle into the Brasilia of the North was way over the top. Newcastle has a long and proud history and we have to build on that ‚Äì not just ignore it and look for the next big thing.\\"  In the media  Smith starred in a drama-documentary film, T. Dan Smith: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Utopia about his life story and the regeneration of Newcastle. Produced by Amber Films, the production was based on Smith's autobiography. It had a cinema release in 1987, and was broadcast on Channel 4 the following year. In February 1988 Smith made an extended appearance on an episode of After Dark, a live British discussion television programme entitled Freemasonry: Beyond the Law?, along with David Napley and others. Smith's career was the inspiration for Austin Donohue, a character in Peter Flannery's play, Our Friends in the North. The part was first played by Jim Broadbent in the Royal Shakespeare Company production in 1982, and then by Alun Armstrong in the 1996 BBC television drama version.Flannery, Peter. Retrospective ‚Äì An interview with the creators of the series. Included as a bonus feature on the Our Friends in the North DVD release. (BMG DVD 74321 941149). In his final years, Smith was a pundit on North East matters. He took part in a Radio Newcastle phone-in just nine days before his death. The song \\"Dan the Plan\\" by Alan Hull, featured in his album Squire (1975), refers to T. Dan Smith.

It is not to be confused with the fighting at Hoke's Run which was also known as the Battle of Falling Waters. thumb300pxGettysburg Campaign (July 5‚Äì July 14) During the night of July 4‚ÄìJuly 5, Gen. Robert E. Lee's battered Confederate army began its retreat from Gettysburg, moving southwest on the Fairfield Road toward Hagerstown and Williamsport, screened by Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart's cavalry. The Union infantry followed cautiously the next day, converging on Middletown, Maryland. By July 7, Brig. Gen. John D. Imboden stopped Brig. Gen. John Buford's Union cavalry from occupying Williamsport and destroying Confederate trains. On July 6, Brig. Gen. Judson Kilpatrick's cavalry division drove two Confederate cavalry brigades through Hagerstown before being forced to retire by the arrival of the rest of Stuart's command. Lee's infantry reached the rain-swollen Potomac River but could not cross, the pontoon bridge having been destroyed by a cavalry raid. On July 11, Lee entrenched in a line protecting the river crossings at Williamsport and waited for Maj. Gen. George G. Meade's Army of the Potomac to advance. On July 12, Meade reached the vicinity and probed the Confederate line. On July 13, skirmishing was heavy along the lines as Meade positioned his forces for an attack. In the meantime, the river fell enough to allow the construction of a new bridge, and Lee's army began crossing the river after dark on the 13th. On the morning of July 14, Kilpatrick's and Buford's cavalry divisions approached from the north and east respectively. Before allowing Buford to gain a position on the flank and rear, Kilpatrick attacked the rearguard division of Maj. Gen. Henry Heth, taking more than 500 prisoners. Confederate Brig. Gen. J. Johnston Pettigrew was mortally wounded in the fight. On July 16, Brig. Gen. David McM. Gregg's cavalry approached Shepherdstown where the brigades of Brig. Gens. Fitzhugh Lee and John R. Chambliss, supported by Col. Milton J. Ferguson's brigade, held the Potomac River fords against the Union infantry. Fitzhugh Lee and Chambliss attacked Gregg, who held out against several attacks and sorties, fighting sporadically until nightfall, when he withdrew.

History The area that is now the Maple Leaf neighborhood appeared on maps in 1894 as a plat by real estate promoters and was called the Maple Leaf Addition to the Green Lake Tract. The name may have come from the Maple Saw Mill that operated to the east on Lake Washington or from some maple trees that once grew in the area. There is also an apocryphal story that Maple Leaf was so far north of downtown Seattle that it got its name for being near Canada. It wasn't until after World War II that the entirety of Maple Leaf neighborhood was within the Seattle city limits. Prior to 1954 the city line was located at 85th Street, but after a series of annexations took place the city limits moved to its current location of 145th Street. Neighborhood of the Year In 1986 Maple Leaf was given the title of national \\"Neighborhood of the Year\\" by Neighborhoods USA. Seattle Mayor Charles Royer nominated Maple Leaf for the award. Boundaries and Geography Although Seattle neighborhood boundaries are unofficial, Maple Leaf lies between Interstate 5 in the west and State Route 522 (also known as Lake City Way) in the east. The neighborhood goes as far north as Northgate Way and as far south as NE 75th Street. Bordering neighborhoods include Roosevelt neighborhood to the south; Pinehurst and Victory Heights neighborhoods of the Northgate district to the north; Lake City and Wedgwood neighborhoods to the east; North College Park or Licton Springs neighborhood to the west. The highest point in Maple Leaf, located on 92nd Street and Roosevelt Way, is 466 feet above sea level, making it the third highest point of elevation in Seattle. Distinctive features of the neighborhood include the water tower and reservoir located at 85th and Roosevelt, plus historic Waldo Hospital at 85th NE and NE 15th. The water tower is painted with a distinctive coupling of maple leaves viewable from Interstate 5. Park and Reservoir The Maple Leaf reservoir was completed in 1910 with the purpose of creating a reservoir for residential and commercial water use. In 2009 the Seattle city government began plans to move the reservoir underground. This was part of a citywide plan to replace all open reservoirs with underground structures in order to improve the quality and security of the water supply and provide new public open spaces on reservoir lids throughout Seattle. In 2013 the 16-acre park was completed. Schools and library=Schools There are two public elementary schools in Maple Leaf which are part of the citywide Seattle Public Schools district. *Olympic View Elementary School is a 20-room, 2-story brick building located on the 500 block of 95th Street. Founded in 1903 as the East Oak Lake School, Olympic View is one of the oldest schools in the city. The current building was constructed in 1989. *Sacajawea Elementary School opened in 1955 with nine portable buildings. The current building was completed in 1959 and is located on the 9500 block of 20th Avenue. The school was named after Sacagawea, a Shoshone Indian woman who helped to guide the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Along with the two public elementary schools Maple Leaf is home to a handful of private schools. *The Fairview School: A K-8th grade school affiliated with the Church of God. The building was built in 1908 and housed a public elementary school for 70-years. After the school closed the site was put up for bid with the neighborhood fiercely opposing a plan to convert the school to low income housing units. Originally the site was sold to the Pacific Northwest Ballet but after that deal fell through the Woodland Park Avenue Church purchased the building. *St. Catherine School: A Catholic school serving students ranging from K-8th grade. The school was founded in 1941 and was staffed by the Sisters of Providence for 35-years. * The Perkins School: A K-5th grade school located on 9000 block of Roosevelt. =The Maple Leaf School= Although it would be considered outside of the current Maple Leaf neighborhoods boundaries, the Maple Leaf School opened in 1896 near Lake Washington. Library The Northgate Library, which is a branch of the Seattle Public Library system, is located on 10500 block of 5th Avenue, across from Northgate Mall. The library and the adjacent community center and park opened in July 2006.

In modern times, there are two distinct implementations of the Job Entry System called JES2 and JES3. They are designed to provide efficient execution of batch jobs. Job processing is divided into several phases to provide parallelism through pipelining. These phases include input processing where jobs are read and interpreted, the execution phase where jobs run, and output processing where job output is printed or stored on DASD. Jobs that are in the same phase of execution are usually said to reside on a particular queue; for example, jobs that are currently executing are on the execution queue. To improve I/O efficiency, JES performs spooling, which provides multiple jobs with simultaneous access to a common storage volume. JES uses a structure called a checkpoint to backup information about currently executing jobs and their associated output. The checkpoint can be used to restore jobs and output in the event of unexpected hardware or software failures. Although JES2 and JES3 provide the same core functionality, there are certain features that may be present in one JES but not the other. Because of these differences, one JES may be favored over the other in certain customer installations. JCL is used to define jobs to both JES2 and JES3, but small changes usually need to be made to the JCL to get a job written for one JES to run on the other.  History = Precursors  OS/360's batch job processing had limited operational flexibility and performance, which was addressed by two field- developed packages called the Houston Automatic Spooling Priority (HASP) and the Attached Support Processor (ASP). = HASP = HASP was developed by IBM Federal Systems Division contractors at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. It originally managed job scheduling and print and punch output for a single OS/360 computer. Multi Access Spool capability was added to let peer computers share a common job queue and print/punch output queues. With the introduction of System/370 in 1972, IBM rewrote HASP to become a standard part of the system and renamed it Job Entry Subsystem 2. JES2 was introduced in OS/VS2 in Release 2, also known as MVS, in 1973. It was many years before the HASP labels were removed from the source code, and the messages issued by JES2 are still prefixed with \`$HASP\`. Several JES2 commands continue to support specification of either \`JES2\` or \`HASP\` to maintain backwards compatibility. = ASP = ASP initially stood for Attached Support Processor,Eventually renamed to Asymmetric Multiprocessing System and was developed to provide efficient use of multiple OS/360 systems with a shared workload. It allowed one central system to distribute jobs to multiple connected systems. ASP was announced in March 1967, and that year was reported to be \\"running very stably\\". ASP evolved from the design of the 7094/7040 Direct Coupled System, using data channel to data channel communication. By attaching an IBM 7040 as a peripheral, processor throughput was more than doubled. In a typical ASP configuration, a small mainframe such as a 360/40 called the support system controlled one or more 360/65 or larger processors called main systems. The computers were connected through selector channels on each host attached to channel-to-channel adapters in an early form of short distance, point-to-point computer networking. ASP required the purchase of an additional computer to manage input and output of the hosts running the job workload, which was economically justified by the high cost of standalone byte-multiplexor channels needed to drive printers and punched card reader devices; the 360/50 and smaller systems had a built-in byte multiplexor channel, whereas the faster 360/65 and larger systems required a relatively expensive standalone unit. Using ASP made it possible to avoid the cost of the byte multiplexor channel, and offloading the job scheduling, print, and card handling also offloaded those functions from the larger machines. Increased reliability was another advantage to offset the added hardware cost. One or more main systems could fail or be taken offline for maintenance without taking down the whole complex. ASP was primarily targeted at large government agencies and defense contractors that might have as many as six 360/65s all being scheduled and managed by a separate ASP machine. An uncommon variant, local ASP (LASP), was a single large machine with the ASP functions running on the same machine. In the 1970s, a notable installation of ASP was at Princeton University controlling an IBM 360/91 mainframe. In 1973, IBM rewrote ASP and renamed it JES3, supporting MVS only.  Alternatives  There was also a JES in OS/VS1 that was often referred to as JES1. In addition, the master (MSTR) subsystem is built into the modern z/OS operating system to start jobs that run outside of the control of JES, including the primary JES itself.  Customization  Source code was provided to IBM customers for both ASP and HASP, and many customers made substantial enhancements to these programs, some of which were incorporated into the official product. Far more installations made use of HASP than ASP, and in contemporary z/OS systems, there are many more JES2 installations than JES3. Because of their unique history, IBM continues to ship JES2 and JES3 source code instead of object code, unlike most components of the operating system. To improve maintainability and serviceability of user-written enhancements, JES provides a set of exit points that pass control from the JES to user programs at key points of processing. These extensions can provide custom functionality such as special commands, custom print page headings, and non-standard job processing.  Current development  In 2017, IBM released a statement of direction for JES2 to be the \\"strategic\\" JES, meaning that all future development efforts will be focused on JES2 rather than JES3. IBM has reassured customers that JES3 will continue to be supported until an end-of-support date is announced. In February 2019, IBM announced that z/OS 2.5 (expected to be released in 2021) will be the last version of z/OS to include JES3. In October 2019, Phoenix Software International announced that it had licensed the JES3 source code from IBM and would be taking over its maintenance and enhancement.

Three fellow students escorted Smart back to her hall of residence after an off-campus party. Her death is an actively investigated missing person case. On September 6, 2016, the San Luis Obispo Sheriff Department reported it had received information about the possible location of Smart's remains, resulting in a hillside excavation on the Cal Poly campus. After five days of digging, bones were recovered from at least one excavation site. However, it was initially unclear if the findings were animal or human, and forensic analysis may take months to determine. Background Kristin Denise Smart was born February 20, 1977, in Augsburg, Germany, to Stan and Denise Smart, both teachers. She had one brother and one sister. Smart's family relocated to the United States during her childhood, where she was raised in Stockton, California. Disappearance Smart was enrolled at California Polytechnic State University, or Cal Poly, in San Luis Obispo, California. On the night she disappeared, which fell on Memorial Day weekend, Smart attended a birthday party for a fellow student. At approximately 2:00 a.m. on May 25, 1996, she was found passed out on a neighbor's lawn by two fellow students, Cheryl Anderson and Tim Davis, who both had just left the party. They helped Smart to her feet and decided to walk her back to her nearby dormitory. Another student from the party, Paul Flores, joined their group and offered to help the two return Smart to her dorm room safely. Davis departed the group first since he lived off campus and had driven to the party. Anderson was the second to depart the group after she told Flores that he could walk Smart back to her dorm, since he lived closer. Flores stated to police that he walked Smart as far as his dormitory, Santa Lucia Hall, and then allowed her to walk back to her Muir Hall dorm by herself. This was the last known sighting of her. She did not have any money or credit cards at the time she went missing. Official investigation The University Police Department originally suspected that Smart had gone on an unannounced vacation, as was common among students over the holidays, and as a result were slow in reporting her as a missing person to local law enforcement. During the Laci Peterson murder investigation, there were unfounded rumors in the media that Laci's husband Scott Peterson had something to do with Smart's disappearance due to their simultaneous attendance at the Cal Poly campus. There was a brief initial inquiry into whether Peterson was tied to the disappearance, with Peterson denying any involvement, and he was eventually ruled out as a suspect by police. Smart's disappearance remains an unsolved case, although compelling evidence was discovered that points to Paul Flores knowing what happened to her. Although her body was never discovered, Smart‚Äôs bloody earring was found by a tenant at the former residence of Paul Flores‚Äôs mother. This earring has since been lost by the police. Between 1996 and 2007, various searches for her remains and other evidence were conducted, some using police dogs trained to detect the scent of human remains, including searches of properties owned by the Flores family. No useful leads were found for nearly two decades. On September 6, 2016, officials from the San Luis Obispo County Sheriff's Office announced they were investigating a new lead in the case. Cadaver dogs from the FBI were brought in and investigators were preparing to spend approximately four days excavating an area on the Cal Poly campus. After three days, items were found at all three dig sites located on the same hillside near Smart's dorm. A spokesman for the sheriff's office said, \\"The items are being analyzed to see whether they are connected to the case, which could take days, weeks or months\\". The items uncovered are still being investigated . Legacy and later developments Smart's disappearance and slow response by the campus police resulted in the Kristin Smart Campus Security Act being written and sponsored by State Senator Mike Thompson, passed 61‚Äì0 by the California State Legislature, and signed into effect by then-Governor Pete Wilson on August 19, 1998. The law took effect on January 1, 1999, and requires all public colleges and publicly funded educational institutions to have their security services make agreements with local police departments about reporting cases involving or possibly involving violence against students, including missing students. Smart was declared legally dead on May 25, 2002, the sixth anniversary of her disappearance. Her parents, Denise and Stan Smart, took a civil case of wrongful death against Flores, one of the three students who walked Smart to her dorm, in 2005. Flores has denied any involvement in the disappearance. The Flores family had also filed a lawsuit against the Smart family for emotional distress. The San Luis Obispo County Sheriff's Office still reviews the case regularly, having spent thousands of hours and dollars in the last five years (2011‚Äì2016). The FBI have her on file as a high priority missing person investigation, with a reward of $75,000 for information leading to finding her or resolving her case. Terry Black, a Delta-area man, offered a $100,000 reward for Smart's body. Beginning September 30, 2019, Chris Lambert released a series of seven podcast episodes. The podcast recounts, in detail, the publicly available information about Kristin's abduction and subsequent death at the hands of another student on the campus of California Polytechnic State University over 23 years ago. The podcast was downloaded over two million times in its first 4 months. Renewed public interest led to a new billboard being put up in Arroyo Grande in January 2020 to replace the original, which had been up since 1997. On January 18, 2020, the Stockton Record reported that the FBI informed Smart's family that additional news about her disappearance would be coming and that the family \\"might want to get away for a while\\" but did not provide any specific information. However, on January 22, 2020, The Record issued a correction: the FBI did not contact the Smart family; rather, a retired FBI agent who had been in contact with the family for years was the source of the advice.https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kristin-smart-case-fbi-reportedly-tells- mom-of-woman-missing-since-1996-to-be-ready-for-unexpected-news/ On January 29, the San Luis Obispo police department confirmed that two trucks owned by Flores had been taken in as evidence. On February 5, 2020, search warrants were served for \\"specific items of evidence\\" at four different locations two in San Luis Obispo, one in Washington state, and at a home in Los Angeles County.

Sparked by a close interest in cryptology, he then turned to the strange case of Tyler Kent, an American national employed as a code and cipher clerk at the American Embassy in London, at a time when Great Britain was at war with Germany and America claimed to be strictly neutral. In May 1940, Kent was arrested, tried in camera and sentenced to seven years' penal servitude. Clough's book State Secrets: The Kent-Wolkoff Affair (2005) took advantage of privileged access to Government files and also the release of others under the Freedom of Information Act. Sixty-five years after the event, Clough finally revealed the 'real reason' for Kent's arrest and imprisonment ‚Äì which was very different from the earlier versions in officially inspired publications. Clough appeared in the documentary Churchill and the Fascist Plot broadcast on Channel Four on 16 March 2013.Churchill and the Fascist Plot Channel 4; 16 March 2013  Personal life  Clough was educated at the Hulme Grammar School, Oldham and served his national service with the 10th Royal Hussars in Germany. He then worked in a variety of industries, mainly in engineering, before becoming chief executive for a major international company which allowed him to travel widely. He set up his own computer supply and maintenance company in 1983 which he sold out in 1990 in order to concentrate on research and writing.

The conversation depicted in the work's twelve books begins with the question of who is given the credit for establishing a civilization's laws. Its musings on the ethics of government and law have established it as a classic of political philosophy alongside Plato's more widely read Republic. Scholars generally agree that Plato wrote this dialogue as an older man, having failed in his effort in Syracuse on the island of Sicily to guide a tyrant's rule, instead having been thrown in prison. These events are alluded to in the Seventh Letter. The text is noteworthy as Plato's only undisputed dialogue not to feature Socrates.  Summary = Setting  Unlike most of Plato's dialogues, Socrates does not appear in the Laws: the dialogue takes place on the island of Crete, and Socrates appears outside of Athens in Plato's writings only twice, in the Phaedrus, where he is just outside the city's walls, and in the Republic, where he goes down to the seaport Piraeus five miles outside of Athens. The conversation is instead led by an Athenian Stranger () and two other old men, the ordinary Spartan citizen Megillos and the Cretan politician and lawgiver Clinias from Knossos. The Athenian Stranger, who resembles Socrates but whose name is never mentioned, joins the other two on their religious pilgrimage from Knossos to the cave of Zeus. The entire dialogue takes place during this journey, which mimics the action of Minos: said by the Cretans to have made their ancient laws, Minos walked this path every nine years in order to receive instruction from Zeus on lawgiving. It is also said to be the longest day of the year, allowing for the densely packed twelve chapters. By the end of the third book Clinias announces that he has in fact been given the responsibility of creating the laws for a new Cretan colony, and that he would like the Stranger's assistance. The rest of the dialogue proceeds with the three old men, walking towards the cave and making laws for this new city which is called the city of the Magnetes (or Magnesia).Cf. Plato, Laws. Book VIII, 848D. \\"And if there exist any local deities of the Magnetes or any shrines of ancient gods whose memory is still preserved, we shall pay to them the same worship as did the men of old. ...\\". A footnote in the Loeb Classical Library 1926 edition, translated by R.G. Bury, says: \\"The original inhabitants of the site of Clinias's new colony (cp. 702 B, 860 E); they subsequently migrated to Magnesia in Asia Minor\\".Hunter, Virginia, \\"Plato's Prisons\\", in Greece & Rome journal, v.55, n.2, October 2008, pp.193‚Äì201  Topics  The question asked at the beginning is not \\"What is law?\\" as one would expect. That is the question of the apocryphal Platonic dialogue Minos. The dialogue rather proceeds from the question, \\"who it is that receives credit for creating laws.\\" The questions of the Laws are quite numerous, including: *Divine revelation, divine law and law-giving *The role of intelligence in law-giving *The relations of philosophy, religion, and politics *The role of music, exercise and dance in education *Natural law and natural right The dialogue uses primarily the Athenian and Spartan (Lacedaemonian) law systems as background for pinpointing a choice of laws, which the speakers imagine as a more or less coherent set for the new city they are talking about.  Comparisons = Comparisons to Plato's other dialogues  The Laws is similar to and yet in opposition to the Republic. It is similar in that both dialogues concern the making of a city in speech. The city of the Laws is described as \\"second best\\", not because the city of the Republic is the best, but because it is the city of gods and their children. The city of the Laws differs in its allowance of private property and private families, and in the very existence of written laws, from the city of the Republic, with its property-system and community of wives for the guardians, and absence of written law. Also, whereas the Republic is a dialogue between Socrates and several young men, the Laws is a discussion among old men, where children are not allowed and there is always a pretense of piety and ritualism. Traditionally, the Minos is thought to be the preface, and the Epinomis the epilogue, to the Laws, but these are generally considered by scholars to be spurious.John M. Cooper in Plato, Complete Works. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing, 2002.  Comparisons to other works on Greek law  Plato was not the only Ancient Greek author writing about the law systems of his day, and making comparisons between the Athenian and the Spartan laws. Notably, the Constitution of the Spartans by Xenophon, the Constitution of the Athenians, wrongly attributed to Xenophon, and the Constitution of the Athenians, possibly by Aristotle or one of his students, have also survived. Some centuries later Plutarch would also devote attention to the topic of Ancient Greek law systems, e.g. in his Life of Lycurgus. Lycurgus was the legendary law-giver of the Lacedaemonians. Plutarch compares Lycurgus and his Spartan laws to the law system Numa Pompilius introduced in Rome around 700 BC.Plutarch, Plutarch's Lives. Nabu Press, 2010. Both pseudo-Xenophon and Plutarch are stark admirers of the Spartan system, showing less reserve than Plato in expressing that admiration.

The Jewish Revolts Against Rome, A.D. 66-135: A Military Analysis. McFarland. 2010. While the First Jewish‚ÄìRoman War (66‚Äì73 CE) and the Bar Kokhba revolt (132‚Äì136 CE) were nationalist rebellions, striving to restore an independent Judean state, the Kitos War was more of an ethno-religious conflict, mostly fought outside Judea Province. Hence, some sources use the term Jewish-Roman Wars to refer only to the First Jewish‚ÄìRoman War (66‚Äì73 CE) and the Bar Kokhba revolt (132‚Äì135 CE), while others include the Kitos War (115‚Äì117 CE) as one of the Jewish‚ÄìRoman wars. The Jewish‚ÄìRoman wars had a dramatic impact on the Jewish people, turning them from a major population in the Eastern Mediterranean into a scattered and persecuted minority. The Jewish‚ÄìRoman wars are often cited as a disaster to Jewish society.Hitti, P. K. The events also had a major impact on Judaism, after the central worship site of Second Temple Judaism, the Second Temple in Jerusalem, was destroyed by Titus' troops. Although having a sort of autonomy in Galilee until the 4th century and later a limited success in establishing the short-lived Sasanian Jewish autonomy in Jerusalem in 614‚Äì617 CE, Jewish dominance in parts of the Southern Levant was regained only in the mid-20th century, with the founding of the modern state of Israel in 1948 CE. Background Following increasing Roman domination of the Eastern Mediterranean, the client kingdom of the Herodian dynasty had been officially merged into the Roman Empire in the year 6 CE with the creation of the Roman province of Judea. The transition of the Tetrarchy of Judea into a Roman province immediately brought a great deal of tensions and a Jewish uprising by Judas of Galilee erupted right away as a response to the Census of Quirinius. Although initially pacified (the years between 7 and 26 CE being relatively quiet), the province continued to be a source of trouble under Emperor Caligula (after 37 CE). The cause of tensions in the east of the Empire was complicated, involving the spread of Greek culture, Roman law, and the rights of Jews in the Empire. Caligula did not trust the prefect of Roman Egypt, Aulus Avilius Flaccus. Flaccus had been loyal to Tiberius, had conspired against Caligula's mother and had connections with Egyptian separatists.Philo of Alexandria, Flaccus III.8, IV.21. In 38 CE, Caligula sent Herod Agrippa to Alexandria unannounced to check on Flaccus.Philo of Alexandria, Flaccus V.26‚Äì28. According to Philo, the visit was met with jeers from the Greek population, who saw Agrippa as the king of the Jews.Philo of Alexandria, Flaccus V.29. Flaccus tried to placate both the Greek population and Caligula by having statues of the emperor placed in Jewish synagogues.Philo of Alexandria, Flaccus VI.43. As a result, extensive religious riots broke out in the city.Philo of Alexandria, Flaccus VII.45. Caligula responded by removing Flaccus from his position and executing him.Philo of Alexandria, Flaccus XXI.185. In 39 CE, Agrippa accused Herod Antipas, the tetrarch of Galilee and Perea, of planning a rebellion against Roman rule with the help of Parthia. Herod Antipas confessed and Caligula exiled him. Agrippa was rewarded with his territories.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews XVIII.7.2. Riots again erupted in Alexandria in 40 CE between Jews and Greeks.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews XVIII.8.1. Jews were accused of not honoring the emperor. Disputes occurred also in the city of Jamnia.Philo of Alexandria, On the Embassy to Gaius XXX.201. Jews were angered by the erection of a clay altar and destroyed it. In response, Caligula ordered the erection of a statue of himself in the Temple of Jerusalem,Philo of Alexandria, On the Embassy to Gaius XXX.203. a demand in conflict with Jewish monotheism.Philo of Alexandria, On the Embassy to Gaius XVI.115. In this context, Philo writes that Caligula \\"regarded the Jews with most especial suspicion, as if they were the only persons who cherished wishes opposed to his\\". The governor of Roman Syria, Publius Petronius, fearing civil war if the order were carried out, delayed implementing it for nearly a year.Philo of Alexandria, On the Embassy to Gaius XXXI.213. Agrippa finally convinced Caligula to reverse the order. However, only Caligula's death at the hands of Roman conspirators in 41 CE prevented a full-scale war in Judaea, that might have well spread to the entire Eastern Roman Empire.H.H. Ben-Sasson, A History of the Jewish People, Harvard University Press, 1976, , The Crisis Under Gaius Caligula, pages 254‚Äì256: \\"The reign of Gaius Caligula (37‚Äì41) witnessed the first open break between the Jews and the Julio-Claudian empire. Until then -- if one accepts Sejanus' heyday and the trouble caused by the census after Archelaus' banishment -- there was usually an atmosphere of understanding between the Jews and the empire ... These relations deteriorated seriously during Caligula's reign, and, though after his death the peace was outwardly re-established, considerable bitterness remained on both sides. ... Caligula ordered that a golden statue of himself be set up in the Temple in Jerusalem. ... Only Caligula's death, at the hands of Roman conspirators (41), prevented the outbreak of a Jewish-Roman war that might well have spread to the entire East.\\" Caligula's death did not stop the tensions completely and in 46 CE an insurrection led by two brothers, the Jacob and Simon uprising, broke out in the Judea province. The revolt, mainly in the Galilee, began as sporadic insurgency; when it climaxed in 48 CE it was quickly put down by Roman authorities. Both Simon and Jacob were executed.  Sequence  The Jewish‚ÄìRoman wars include the following: * First Jewish‚ÄìRoman War (66‚Äì73 CE) ‚Äî also called the First Jewish Revolt or the Great Jewish Revolt, spanning from the 66 CE insurrection, through the 67 CE fall of the Galilee, the destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple and institution of the Fiscus Judaicus in 70 CE, and finally the fall of Masada in 73 CE. * Kitos War (115‚Äì117 CE) ‚Äî known as the \\"Rebellion of the Exile\\" and sometimes called the Second Jewish‚ÄìRoman War. * Bar Kokhba revolt (132‚Äì136 CE) ‚Äî also called the Second Jewish‚ÄìRoman War (when Kitos War is not counted), or the Third (when the Kitos War is counted). History=First Jewish‚ÄìRoman War The First Jewish‚ÄìRoman War began in the year 66 CE, originating in the Greek and Jewish religious tensions, and later escalated due to anti-taxation protests and attacks upon Roman citizens.Josephus, War of the Jews II.8.11, II.13.7, II.14.4, II.14.5 In response to the Roman plunder of the Second Jewish Temple and the execution of up to 6,000 Jews in Jerusalem, a full-scale rebellion erupted. The Roman military garrison of Judaea was quickly overrun by rebels, while the pro-Roman king Herod Agrippa II together with Roman officials fled Jerusalem. As it became clear the rebellion was getting out of control, Cestius Gallus, the legate of Syria, brought the Syrian army, based on XII Fulminata and reinforced by auxiliary troops, to restore order and quell the revolt. Despite initial advances, the Syrian Legion was ambushed and defeated by Jewish rebels at the Battle of Beth Horon with 6,000 Romans massacred and the Legio aquila lost ‚Äì a result that shocked the Roman leadership. The experienced and unassuming general Vespasian was then tasked with crushing the rebellion in Judaea province. His son Titus was appointed second-in-command. Vespasian was given four legions and assisted by forces of King Agrippa II. In 67 CE he invaded Galilee. While avoiding a direct attack on the reinforced city of Jerusalem which was packed with the main rebel force, Titus' forces launched a persistent campaign to eradicate rebel strongholds and punish the population. Within several months Vespasian and Titus took over the major Jewish strongholds of Galilee and finally overran Jotapata under command of Yosef ben Matitiyahu, following a 47-day siege. Meantime in Jerusalem, an attempt by Sicarii leader Menahem to take control of the city failed, resulting in his execution. A peasant leader Simon Bar-Giora was ousted from the city by the new moderate Judean government and Ananus ben Ananus began reinforcing the city. Driven from Galilee, Zealot rebels and thousands of refugees arrived in Judea, creating political turmoil in Jerusalem. Zealots were at first sealed in the Temple compound. However, confrontation between the mainly Sadducee Jerusalemites and the mainly Zealot factions of the Northern Revolt under the command of John of Giscala and Eleazar ben Simon became evident. With Edomites entering the city and fighting on the side of the Zealots, Ananus ben Ananus was killed and his forces suffered severe casualties. Simon bar Giora, commanding 15,000 troops, was then invited into Jerusalem by the Sadducee leaders to stand against the Zealots, and quickly took control over much of the city. Bitter infighting between factions of Bar Giora, John and Elazar followed through the year 69 CE. After a lull in the military operations, owing to civil war and political turmoil in Rome, Vespasian returned to Rome and was accepted as the new Emperor in 69 CE. With Vespasian's departure, Titus besieged the center of rebel resistance in Jerusalem in early 70 CE. While the first two walls of Jerusalem were breached within three weeks, a stubborn stand prevented the Roman Army from breaking the third and thickest wall. Following a brutal seven-month siege, in which Zealot infighting resulted in the burning of the entire food supply of the city to enhance \\"fighting to the end\\", the Romans finally succeeded in breaching the weakened Jewish forces in the summer of 70 CE. Following the fall of Jerusalem, Titus left for Rome, while Legion X Fretensis defeated the remaining Jewish strongholds later on, finalizing the Roman campaign in Masada in 73/74 CE. Kitos War The Kitos War (115‚Äì117 CE) also known as mered ha'galuyot or mered ha'tfutzot (Rebellion of the exile) is the name given to the second of the Jewish‚ÄìRoman wars. The Kitos War consisted of major revolts by diasporic Jews in Cyrene (Cyrenaica), Cyprus, Mesopotamia and Aegyptus, which spiraled out of control, resulting in a widespread slaughter of Roman citizens and others (200,000 in Cyrene, 240,000 in Cyprus according to Cassius Dio) by the Jewish rebels. The rebellions were finally crushed by Roman legionary forces, chiefly by the Roman general Lusius Quietus, whose nomen later gave the conflict its title, as \\"Kitos\\" is a later corruption of Quietus. Bar Kokhba Revolt The Bar Kokhba revolt (132‚Äì136 CE,for the year 136, see: W. Eck, The Bar Kokhba Revolt: The Roman Point of View, pp. 87‚Äì88. ) was the third major rebellion by the Jews of Judaea Province and the Eastern Mediterranean against the Roman Empire and the last of the Jewish‚ÄìRoman wars. Simon bar Kokhba, the commander of the revolt, was acclaimed as a Messiah, a heroic figure who could restore Israel. The revolt established an independent state of Israel over parts of Judea for more than two years, but a Roman army made up of six full legions with auxilia and elements from up to six additional legions finally crushed it. The Romans then barred Jews from Jerusalem, except to attend Tisha B'Av. Although Jewish Christians hailed Jesus as the Messiah and did not support Bar Kokhba,Justin, \\"Apologia\\", ii.71, compare \\"Dial.\\" cx; Eusebius \\"Hist. Eccl.\\" iv.6,¬ß2; Orosius \\"Hist.\\" vii.13 they were barred from Jerusalem along with the rest of the Jews. The war and its aftermath helped differentiate Christianity as a religion distinct from Judaism (see Jewish Christian#Split of early Christianity and Judaism).M. Avi-Yonah, The Jews under Roman and Byzantine Rule, Jerusalem 1984 p. 143 The rebellion is also known as The Third Jewish‚ÄìRoman War or The Third Jewish Revolt, though some historians relate it as Second Jewish Revolt, not counting the Kitos War, 115‚Äì117 CE. Aftermath Due to the First Jewish-Roman War, the destruction of the Second Temple ushered in a major time of dramatic reformation in religious leadership, causing the face of Judaism to change. The Second Temple served as the centralized location from which the ruling groups Sadducees and the Pharisees maintained Judaism, with rivaling Essenes and Zealots being largely in opposition. With the destruction of the temple, the major ruling group lost their powerthe Sadducees, who were the priests, directly lost their localized power source and were rendered obsolete. Due to this, only one group was left with all the powerthe Pharisees, who were the rabbinic group. The rabbinic groups‚Äô power did not derive from the temple or from military prowess, which enabled their power to spread among synagogues to different communities. This changed the way Judaism was practiced on a daily basis, which included changing from sacrificing animals to praying in order to worship God. Rabbinic Judaism became a religion centered around synagogues, and the Jews themselves dispersed throughout the Roman world and beyond.Rabbi Nosson Dovid Rabinowich (ed.), The Iggeres of Rav Sherira Gaon, Jerusalem 1988, p. 6. With the destruction of Jerusalem, important centers of Jewish culture developed in the area of Galilee and in Babylonia and work on the Talmud continued in these locations. Before Vespasian's departure, the Pharisaic sage and Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai obtained his permission to establish a Judaic school at Yavne. Zakkai was smuggled away from Jerusalem in a coffin by his students. This school later became a major center of Talmudic study (see Mishnah). Hadrian (emperor 117‚Äì138 CE) attempted to completely root out Judaism, which he saw as the cause of continuous rebellions. He prohibited the Torah and the Hebrew calendar and executed Judaic scholars. The sacred scroll was ceremonially burned on the Temple Mount. At the former Temple sanctuary he installed two statues, one of Jupiter, another of himself. In an attempt to erase any memory of Judea or Ancient Israel, he wiped the name off the map and replaced it with Syria Palaestina, supplanting earlier terms, such as Judaea. Similarly, he re- established Jerusalem, this time as the Roman polis of Aelia Capitolina, and Jews were barred from entering the city, except on the fast day of Tisha B'Av.H.H. Ben-Sasson, A History of the Jewish People, page 334: \\"Jews were forbidden to live in the city and were allowed to visit it only once a year, on the Ninth of Ab, to mourn on the ruins of their holy Temple.\\" The Jewish‚ÄìRoman wars had a dramatic impact on the Jews, turning them from a major population in the Eastern Mediterranean into a scattered and persecuted minority. The Jewish‚ÄìRoman wars are often cited as a disaster to Jewish society. The defeat of the Jewish revolts altered the Jewish population and enhanced the importance of Jewish diaspora, essentially moving the demographic center of Jews from Judea to Galilee and Babylon, with minor communities across the Mediterranean. Although having a sort of autonomy in the Galilee until the 4th century and later a limited success in establishing the short- lived Sasanian Jewish autonomy in Jerusalem in 614‚Äì617 CE, Jewish dominance in parts of the Southern Levant was regained only in the mid-20th century, with the founding of the modern state of Israel in 1948 CE.

It runs from Llandudno via Llandudno Junction () to Blaenau Ffestiniog, and was originally part of the London and North Western Railway, being opened in stages to 1879. The primary purpose of the line was to carry slate from the Ffestiniog quarries to a specially built quay at Deganwy for export by sea. The line also provided goods facilities for the market town of Llanrwst, and via the extensive facilities at Betws-y-Coed on the London to Holyhead A5 turnpike road it served many isolated communities in Snowdonia and also the developing tourist industry. Although only a little over between Llandudno and Blaenau Ffestiniog, the journey takes over one hour, largely due to the sinuous and steeply graded nature of the route taken (particularly south of Betws-y-Coed). Most of the stations along the line are treated as request stops.  History  The first section from Llandudno Junction to Llanrwst (now called North Llanrwst) was built as the Conway and Llanrwst Railway and opened in 1863. The LNWR took over in 1863 and opened the extension to Betws-y-Coed in 1868.Baughan 1980, page 117 The next extension was to Blaenau Ffestiniog to access the output of the large slate quarries there. At first the LNWR proposed a 2' narrow gauge railway via the steeply graded Lledr Valley to Blaenau Ffestiniog, this being the 'Bettws & Festiniog Railway'; authorisation was sought in November 1870.The Cambrian News and Merionethshire Standard, 26 November 1870 After construction began, it was decided that the extension would be built to standard gauge, allowing through running of trains. Between 1874 and 1879 the railway tunnel underneath Moel Dyrnogydd was bored, and in July 1879 a terminus was initially opened by the tunnel entrance. The line was subsequently extended by the best part of a mile to a terminus in the town, which opened 31 March 1881.Baughan 1980, pages 128-130The North Wales Express, 1 April 1881 Blaenau Ffestiniog's other standard gauge railway, the Bala and Ffestiniog Railway, was closed to all traffic in 1961, and a portion was flooded in the creation of the Llyn Celyn reservoir. A rail connection was desired for the nuclear power station under construction at Trawsfynydd, and a connecting line was built from Blaenau Ffestiniog North to the site of the demolished Blaenau Ffestiniog Central station for freight use. With the reconstruction of the Ffestiniog Railway, passenger services were relocated to a new joint station on the site of the old Central station in 1982. Regular freight traffic to Trawsfynydd nuclear power station ceased in 1995, and the power station is being decommissioned. The line's proximity to the River Conwy at its northern end has led to periodic problems with flooding over the years. In 2004, 2005 and 2019 floods resulted in prolonged closures whilst the trackbed and embankments were rebuilt - the 2004 floods putting the line out of action from early February until 22 May that year.\\"Flooding closed the Conwy Valley line for 3 months\\" ‚Äì The Conway Valley Line, Penmorfa.com; Retrieved 4 March 2016 The line was again closed from 27 December 2015 for seven weeks, after the formation was damaged by floodwater in more than 100 places following heavy rain on Boxing Day.Conwy Valley line had 1,200 tonnes of material removed from railway during repair work Davidson, Tom; Daily Post article 10 February 2016; Retrieved 4 March 2016 A further closure occurred between February and April 2017 after Storm Doris, when a tree fell on the track near Pont-y-Pant.

The service is reduced to 4 trains per day in both directions on Sundays - this service now operates all year round, rather than in summer only as it did up until the winter 2019 timetable change. The train service is operated by Transport for Wales Rail and is being marketed as the Conwy Valley Railway ().

From 20 May 2007, Concessionary Travel Pass holders resident in Conwy and Gwynedd have been able to travel free of charge on the Conwy Valley Railway line between Llandudno and Blaenau Ffestiniog, as well as between Llandudno Junction and Llandudno on all Transport for Wales Rail services, as a result of funding provided by the Welsh Assembly Government. The Office of Rail Regulation says 116,500 passenger journeys were made on the line in 2013/14, excluding exits and entries at the main line stations of Llandudno Junction, Deganwy and Llandudno. This was a small increase compared with the figure of 112,134 in 2012/13. Figures show that Blaenau Ffestiniog is the busiest of the line's stations with 44,828 passengers in 2013/14, followed by Betws-y-Coed with 35,400.

LNER K4 no 61994 The Great Marquess in the loop at Blaenau Ffestiniog after arriving with \\"The Welsh Mountaineer\\" on Tue 29 July 2014. 1998 the first steam working in the preservation era was to run back to Blaenau Ffestiniog from London behind a BR Standard 4 Tank no 80079. The first attempt up the route on 2 May 1998 ended in disaster as the engine stalled near Pont-y-Pant and due to the water supply running low resulted in the train having to be rescued and then returned to Llandudno. A second attempt the day later, this time with just 4 coaches instead of the previous 6 proved successful, with 80079 becoming the first standard gauge steam locomotive in Blaenau for 31 years. On 1 May 1999 LMS black 5 no 45407 worked \\"The Conwy Climber\\" tour from Llandudno Junction to Blaenau Ffestiniog, from the lessons learnt with 80079 it was decided that although 45407 was a power class 5 engine (The BR standard being power class 4) 45407 would take a max of 4 coaches up the line while working solo. 45407 first took up 4 coaches to Blaenau without problems and then returned light engine to Llandudno Junction to collect the remaining four coaches, after this the eight coaches were coupled together for the return trip to Llandudno Junction. Five months later on 17 October the BR Standard tank no 80079 returned for a rematch on the route, this time she was to haul 4 coaches instead of 6 and she was working the trip with another member of her class no 80098. Once again 80079 slipped to a stand near Pont-y-Pant and 80098, which had been waiting with the second portion of the train at Llanrwst, was detached to bank 80079 up to Blaenau. Thereafter the two engines double-headed the remaining 4 coaches before reforming the train to 8 coaches for the journey back to Llandudno. In 2009, after a 10-year gap since the BR Standard tanks had worked up the route, \\"The Railway Touring Company\\" ran a special under the name \\"The Welsh Mountaineer\\" from Worcester to Blaenau Ffestiniog with 2 LMS Black 5's working the train from Llandudno Junction for the journey up the route to Blaenau. The Black 5's chosen for the trip were Bert Hitchen's no 45231 The Sherwood Forester & Ian Riley's no 45407 The Lancashire Fusilier. The locos' support coaches were left at Llandudno for the journey, leaving them with a load of 9 coaches to take up the line's 1 in 47 gradient. After the success of this trip a number of regular \\"Welsh Mountaineer\\" trips are run on select Tuesdays from Preston to Blaenau during the summer months, and today these trips are still running. Unlike the trip with 45231 & 45407 which hauled 9 coaches, steam engines on their own owing to the gradient and curvature of the route are only permitted to haul a max of 6 coaches. Other than the trip in 2009 which ran from Worcester the majority of trips ran from Preston to Blaenau running via Warrington and Frodsham before joining the North Wales Coast Line at Chester for the journey to Llandudno Junction. From Preston till Chester the engines run in the usual chimney first formation and from Chester after turning on the triangle the engine runs tender first to Llandudno Junction where the tour would reverse direction.

However, following the closure and removal of a section of the former Great Western Railway line from Bala, a short section of new railway was built alongside the Ffestiniog Railway Company's narrow gauge line in order to connect the Conwy Valley line with the isolated section of the GWR line, which had been retained to serve the nuclear power station at Trawsfynydd. Years later a new Blaenau Ffestiniog station was constructed in the centre of the town. Beyond the new station, the line was used only for goods traffic connected with Trawsfynydd, although occasional special passenger trains have been run at times. In recent years, the traffic from Trawsfynydd has ceased completely (the last charter special ran in October 1998) and the line has been disconnected from the Conwy Valley line just outside Blaenau Ffestiniog station. There are connections at Llandudno Junction with the North Wales Coast Line (the main line between London and Holyhead) and at Blaenau Ffestiniog with the Ffestiniog Railway to Porthmadog.

The Battle of Boonsboro took place on July 8, 1863, in Washington County, Maryland, as part of the Retreat from Gettysburg during the Gettysburg Campaign of the American Civil War. While Gen. Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia retreated toward Virginia following its defeat in the Battle of Gettysburg, Confederate cavalry held the South Mountain passes. The cavalry fought a rearguard action against elements of the Union 1st and 3rd Cavalry Divisions and supporting infantry. This action was one of a series of successive cavalry engagements around Boonsboro, Hagerstown, and Williamsport. Battle Confederate Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart faced a difficult assignment--locate the Union cavalry and prevent it from severing Gen. Lee's avenue of retreat to Williamsport and the Potomac River. The result was the biggest and most sustained cavalry battle in Maryland during the campaign. The Battle of Boonsboro occurred along the National Road on Wednesday, July 8, 1863. Stuart, with five cavalry brigades, advanced from the direction of Funkstown and Williamsport. He first encountered Federal resistance at Beaver Creek Bridge, north of Boonsboro. By 11 a.m., the Confederate cavalry had pushed forward to several mud-soaked fields, where fighting on horseback was nearly impossible, forcing Stuart's troopers and Brig. Gens. H. Judson Kilpatrick's and John Buford's Union cavalry divisions to dismount and slug it out like infantry. By mid-afternoon, the Union left under Kilpatrick crumbled as the Federals ran low on ammunition under increasing Confederate pressure. Stuart's advanced ended about 7 p.m., however, when Union infantry arrived--the first to engage in battle since Gettysburg. Stuart withdrew north to Funkstown, but he had gained another day for Lee's retreating army. Two days later, he would again delay the Federal pursuit at the Battle of Funkstown.Maryland Civil War Trails wayside marker for the Battle of Boonsboro References *National Park Service battle description Notes 1863 in the United States Boonsboro Boonsboro Boonsboro Boonsboro History of Washington County, Maryland 1863 in Maryland Boonsboro July 1863 events ","title":"Battle of Boonsboro"},{"id":"1356272","text":"The fineness of a precious metal object (coin, bar, jewelry, etc.) represents the weight of fine metal therein, in proportion to the total weight which includes alloying base metals and any impurities. Alloy metals are added to increase hardness and durability of coins and jewelry, alter colors, decrease the cost per weight, or avoid the cost of high-purity refinement. For example, copper is added to the precious metal silver to make a more durable alloy for use in coins, housewares and jewelry. Coin silver, which was used for making silver coins in the past, contains 90% silver and 10% copper, by mass. Sterling silver contains 92.5% silver and 7.5% of other metals, usually copper, by mass. Various ways of expressing fineness have been used and two remain in common use: millesimal fineness expressed in units of parts per 1,000 and karats used only for gold. Karats measure the parts per 24, so that 18 karat = = 75% and 24 karat gold is considered 100% gold. Millesimal fineness Millesimal fineness is a system of denoting the purity of platinum, gold and silver alloys by parts per thousand of pure metal by mass in the alloy. For example, an alloy containing 75% gold is denoted as \\"750\\". Many European countries use decimal hallmark stamps (i.e., \\"585\\", \\"750\\", etc.) rather than \\"14K\\", \\"18K\\", etc., which is used in the United Kingdom and United States. It is an extension of the older karat system of denoting the purity of gold by fractions of 24, such as \\"18 karat\\" for an alloy with 75% (18 parts per 24) pure gold by mass. The millesimal fineness is usually rounded to a three figure number, particularly where used as a hallmark, and the fineness may vary slightly from the traditional versions of purity. Here are the most common millesimal finenesses used for precious metals and the most common terms associated with them.

The karat system is a standard adopted by US federal law.  Measure  : K is the karat rating of the material, : Mg is the mass of pure gold in the alloy, and : Mm is the total mass of the material. 24-karat gold is pure (while 100% purity is unattainable, this designation is permitted in commerce for 99.95% purity), 18-karat gold is 18 parts gold, 6 parts another metal (forming an alloy with 75% gold), 12-karat gold is 12 parts gold (12 parts another metal), and so forth.Comprehensive Jewelry Precious Metals Overview International Gem Society (IGS), Retrieved 01-16-2015 In England, the carat was divisible into four grains, and the grain was divisible into four quarts. For example, a gold alloy of fineness (that is, 99.2% purity) could have been described as being 23-karat, 3-grain, 1-quart gold. The karat fractional system is increasingly being complemented or superseded by the millesimal system, described above. Conversion between percentage of pure gold and karats: * 58.33‚Äì62.50% = 14K (acclaimed 58.33%) * 75.00‚Äì79.16% = 18K (acclaimed 75.00%) * 91.66‚Äì95.83% = 22K (acclaimed 91.66%) * 95.83‚Äì99.95% = 23K (acclaimed 95.83%) * 99.95‚Äì100% = 24K (acclaimed 99.95%) Volume However, this system of calculation gives only the mass of pure gold contained in an alloy. The term 18-karat gold means that the alloy's mass consists of 75% of gold and 25% of alloy(s). The quantity of gold by volume in a less- than-24-karat gold alloy differs according to the alloy(s) used. For example, knowing that standard 18-karat yellow gold consists of 75% gold, 12.5% silver and the remaining 12.5% of copper (all by mass), the volume of pure gold in this alloy will be 60% since gold is much denser than the other metals used: 19.32 g/cm3 for gold, 10.49 g/cm3 for silver and 8.96 g/cm3 for copper. This formula gives the amount of gold in cubic centimeters or in milliliters in an alloy: : V_\\\\text{Au} = \\\\frac{M_\\\\text{a} \\\\times \\\\frac{kt}{24}}{19.32} where : VAu is the volume of gold in cubic centimeters or in milliliters, : Ma is the total mass of the alloy in grams, and : kt is the karat purity of the alloy. To have the percentage of the volume of gold in an alloy, divide the volume of gold in cubic centimetres or in millilitres by the total volume of the alloy in cubic centimetres or in millilitres. For 10-carat gold, the gold volume in the alloy represents about 26% of the total volume for standard yellow gold. Talking about purity according to mass could lead to some misunderstandings; for many people, purity means volume. Etymology Karat is a variant of carat. First attested in English in the mid-15th century, the word carat came from Middle French , in turn derived either from Italian or Medieval Latin . These were borrowed into Medieval Europe from the Arabic meaning \\"fruit of the carob tree\\", also \\"weight of 5 grains\\", () and was a unit of masscarat , Oxford Dictionaries though it was probably not used to measure gold in classical times. The Arabic term ultimately originates from the Greek () meaning carob seed (literally \\"small horn\\")Œ∫ŒµœÅŒ¨œÑŒπŒøŒΩ , Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on PerseusWalter W. Skeat (1888), An Etymological Dictionary of the English Language (diminutive of Œ∫Œ≠œÅŒ±œÇ ‚Äì keras, \\"horn\\"Œ∫Œ≠œÅŒ±œÇ , Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus). In 309 CE, Roman Emperor Constantine I began to mint a new gold coin solidus that was of a libra (Roman pound) of gold equal to a mass of 24 siliquae, where each siliqua (or carat) was of a libra. This is believed to be the origin of the value of the karat. Verifying fineness While there are many methods of detecting fake precious metals, there are realistically only two options available for verifying the marked fineness of metal as being reasonably accurate: assaying the metal (which requires destroying it), or using X-ray fluorescence (XRF). XRF will measure only the outermost portion of the piece of metal and so may get misled by thick plating. That becomes a concern because it would be possible for an unscrupulous refiner to produce precious metals bars that are slightly less pure than marked on the bar. A refiner doing $1 billion of business each year that marked .980 pure bars as .999 fine would make about an extra $20 million in profit. In the United States, the actual purity of gold articles must be no more than .003 less than the marked purity (e.g. .996 fine for gold marked .999 fine), and the actual purity of silver articles must be no more than .004 less than the marked purity. Fine weight A piece of alloy metal containing a precious metal may also have the weight of its precious component referred to as its fine weight. For example, 1 troy ounce of 18 karat gold (which is 75% gold) may be said to have a fine weight of 0.75 troy ounces.

Lee's retreat back to Virginia in the final days of the Gettysburg Campaign of the American Civil War. Union forces attempted to force passage across the Blue Ridge Mountains and attack the Confederate rear as it formed a defensive position in the upper Shenandoah Valley. Despite successfully forcing the passage at Manassas Gap, the Union force was unable to do so before Lee retreated further up the valley to safety, resulting in an inconclusive battle. Background Following their defeat at the Battle of Gettysburg, Lee's Confederate Army of Northern Virginia retreated across the Potomac River at Williamsport, Maryland, and withdrew into the Shenandoah Valley. Maj. Gen. George G. Meade's Army of the Potomac, in pursuit of Lee's army, decided to try to flank the Confederate army by crossing the river east of the Blue Ridge Mountains at Harpers Ferry and Berlin, Maryland, into the Loudoun Valley and then forcing a passage across the Blue Ridge in Lee's rear. To this end, on July 23, Meade ordered the III Corps, under Maj. Gen. William H. French, to cut off the retreating Confederate columns at Front Royal, Virginia, by forcing passage through Manassas Gap. Battle Map of Manassas Gap Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program At dawn, French began his attack with the New York Excelsior Brigade, led by Brig. Gen. Francis B. Spinola, against Brig. Gen. Ambrose R. Wright's brigade of Georgians, under the command of Col. Edward J. Walker of the 3rd Georgia Regiment, defending the pass. The fight was slow at first, with the superior Union force using its numbers to push Walker from his defensive position back through the gap. In the late afternoon, around 4:30 p.m., French made a concerted assault on Walker's brigade, driving them from the gap. The Confederates were quickly reinforced by Col Edward Asbury O'Neal's Brigade and artillery of Col Thomas Henry Carter, which stalled the Union advance. By dusk, the Union attack became uncoordinated and was abandoned. During the night, Confederate forces withdrew into the Luray Valley. On July 24, the Union army occupied Front Royal, but Lee's army was safely beyond pursuit.Salmon, pp. 215-16. Aftermath The small fight was inconclusive. The Union army was able to successfully gain passage through the gap in the Blue Ridge and occupy Front Royal, but not before Lee was able to withdraw further up the valley to safety. By failing to cut off the Confederate retreat and bring Lee into battle, the Army of Northern Virginia was allowed to reorganize and regroup. By the end of the summer both armies had taken their familiar positions opposite the Rappahannock and Rapidan rivers, setting the stage for the Bristoe and Mine Run campaigns in the fall.

It was opened in 2001 and originally named Murray Park after the then Rangers owner David Murray. It is also often referred to as Auchenhowie, the name of the locality within Milngavie where it is situated. Following improvements completed in 2019, the facility became the regular home venue for competitive matches played by Rangers' women's team, the club's male under-18 team and some fixtures of the reserve team.  History =Development and opening Prior to the construction of the club's own training facility, the first team trained at several locations across Glasgow including Ibrox Stadium, Bellahouston Park and the West of Scotland cricket ground. A dedicated training complex was first proposed by the then manager Dick Advocaat upon his arrival at the club in June 1998. It was officially opened on 4 July 2001 by Advocaat and then-chairman David Murray, after whom it was originally named as Murray Park. The total cost of the complex was estimated at around ¬£14 million.  Purchase by Green's consortium and use as a security  On 14 June 2012, after the Administration and liquidation of The Rangers Football Club Plc, the training facility was sold along with other Rangers' assets, in a deal worth ¬£5.5m, to The Rangers Football Club Ltd - a consortium led by Charles Green. In July 2014, there was speculation that the Rangers board was looking to sell the facility in order to raise money, due to a fan boycott of season tickets.  Renaming  The use of the name Murray Park significantly reduced after the club was sold to Craig Whyte in 2011. Moreover, after the liquidation of the company running the club and its assets, many fans held David Murray partly or wholly responsible, and so began calling the facility Auchenhowie (after the geographic area where it is based). In June 2012, the then Rangers Chief executive Charles Green stated he would ask Rangers season ticket holders to vote on renaming the club's training ground. Green proposed that it could be renamed the Moses McNeil Academy or the Davie Cooper Academy after former Rangers players. In June 2016, then chairman Dave King revisited the issue of the renaming of Murray Park and asked Rangers fans to suggest an alternative name. In June 2018, the facility was renamed The Hummel Training Centre as part of a sponsorship deal with Danish sportswear company and then club kit manufacturer Hummel. Spectator stand In February 2016, the Rangers Fans Fighting Fund revealed plans to provide ¬£450,000 to build a 264-seater stand at Murray Park. Planning permission was granted in December 2017 for the improvements, which included the stand and further dressing room facilities as well as a classroom area and additional floodlighting. Work began in January 2018 and was completed around 18 months later; the stand was officially opened on 2 August 2019. Structure and facilities The site covers a size of thirty-eight acres (over fifteen hectares). It is divided into three areas: the administration wing, the professional wing for the first team and the youth development wing. The professional and youth wings have their own separate receptions, dining areas, changing rooms, kit stores and lecture rooms. Both share facilities including the gym, medical suite and the indoor synthetic pitch. Outside there are six full-size pitches along with two half- sized, and a practice area. Two of the full-sized and one half-sized pitch are used only by the first team, these have under-soil heating, the others are used by the youth sides. The gym equipment, costing ¬£150,000, is linked to a computer system which can activate a personalised fitness programme for individual players. The gym also houses an iso-kinetic machine, which allows players to work out despite being injured by testing muscle strength and reactions. There is a hydrotherapy pool that has an angled, movable floor and a series of massage jets and currents that allows a range of rehabilitation exercises to take place. There is also a media editing suite costing ¬£50,000 where a video analyst will video each training session. The footage will be used to conduct tactical lessons in the lecture room afterwards.  Other uses Rangers training centre is often used by visiting club and national teams playing in Scotland. For example, the South Korea national football team, then managed by Advocaat, hired the facilities for their training before the 2006 FIFA World Cup. In February 2015, Inter Milan trained at the centre after Rangers agreed to allow the Italians use of the facility prior to a UEFA Europa League match against Celtic. This was not the first time Rangers offered support to a club that were to play city rivals Celtic, having made a similar offer to Juventus in 2013 and Blackburn Rovers (who were managed by Graeme Souness) in 2002.

She was based on the same plans as . Construction and commissioning Although St. Lawrence was laid down in 1826 by the Norfolk Navy Yard in Portsmouth, Virginia, she remained uncompleted on the ways until work on her, interrupted by a shortage of funds, was resumed during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War (1846‚Äì1848). The frigate was finally launched early in 1848 and commissioned on 17 August of that year with Captain Hiram Paulding in command. Service history=European voyage, 1848-1850 On 29 August, the Navy Department, at the request of the Prussian Minister to the United States, directed Paulding to \\"take on board a Mister H. W. Foster and rate him Master's Mate.\\" The German states, then striving to establish a German Federation, had recently become aware of the need for a German navy and had asked the United States for help in establishing and training a national fighting force afloat. The ship got underway on 8 September and headed eastward across the Atlantic. After touching at Cowes, on the Isle of Wight, the ship reached the mouth of the Weser River on 7 October. The next day, she was towed to Bremerhaven. She remained at that port for the next month and one-half while Capt. Paulding visited important cities in several German states to discuss with various leaders matters important to the establishment of the new navy. Before departing Bremerhaven, St. Lawrence received on board four Prussian midshipmen for training, and they served on the frigate, learning the customs, discipline, and seamanship of the United States Navy. The frigate left the mouth of the Weser on 22 November and reached Southampton, England, on 2 December. She was anchored at the port for more than a month while her officers and men exchanged courtesies with their English counterparts, building good will between the two nations. Early in January 1849, the ship sailed for Portugal and reached Lisbon on the 12th. But for a visit to Cadiz, Spain, from 5 February to 14 March, she remained at Lisbon until again sailing for England on 1 May. In July, she returned to Bremerhaven where Paulding discharged the German midshipmen on the 10th, since Prussia was then at war with Denmark, the next country on the frigate's itinerary. St. Lawrence got underway on the 19th and visited Copenhagen until 2 August when she sailed for Sweden. She arrived at Stockholm five days later and remained at that Baltic port until the 16th. On her voyage back south, the frigate touched again at Copenhagen, and spent much of the autumn at Bremerhaven before heading for the Mediterranean. She reached Port Mahon, Minorca, in the Balearics, on 3 December 1849. At that time, political conditions in Europe were still unstable in the aftermath of the revolutions which had shaken Europe in 1848; and the American naval force in the Mediterranean had been increased to its greatest strength since the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. During the protracted series of crises, it had been a source of stability in the area without offending any nation or faction. In the summer of 1850, when tension in Europe began to subside, St. Lawrence was ordered to proceed once more to the Baltic for a short cruise before returning home. She touched at Boston, Massachusetts on 1 November, reached New York on the 6th, and was decommissioned there on the 15th. Voyage to England, 1851 Recommissioned on 5 February 1851, Commander Joshua R. Sands in command, the frigate departed New York on the 20th, carrying to England the exhibits from the United States for the Great Exhibition at London, the first modern world's fair. On her return voyage from this interesting assignment, she gave the United States charg√© d'affaires in Portugal passage from Southampton to Lisbon. The ship reached New York on 11 August and decommissioned there a week later. Pacific Squadron, 1851-1855 Recommissioned on 18 November 1851, St. Lawrence sailed on 12 December for the Pacific. For the next three and one- half years, she cruised along the west coast of North and South America, from Cape Horn to Puget Sound, occasionally venturing as far west as the Sandwich (Hawaiian) Islands. In 1853, she relieved as flagship of the Pacific Squadron and continued this duty until she relinquished her role as flagship to on 2 February 1855. She departed Valpara√≠so five days later and arrived at Hampton Roads on 21 April. She was decommissioned and placed in ordinary at Norfolk, Virginia exactly a month later. Brazil Squadron, 1856-1859 Recommissioned on 22 September 1856, St. Lawrence sailed for the Atlantic coast of South America to become flagship of the Brazil Squadron early the next year. Her service on the Brazil Station was enlivened late in 1858 by the expedition to Paraguay to obtain redress for the unprovoked firing upon the during surveying operations in the Paran√° River. Efforts to settle the affair by negotiations, underway since the incident on 1 February 1855, had been fruitless. However, the presence of a task force, commanded by Flag Officer William B. Shubrick, added eloquence to the arguments of United States Special Commissioner James B. Bowlin. He promptly obtained a satisfactory apology, an indemnity for damages, and a new commercial treaty which established most cordial relations between the two countries. The successful conclusion of the expedition freed St. Lawrence to return home, and she was decommissioned at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 25 May 1859. American Civil War, 1861-1865 Still in ordinary at the outbreak of the American Civil War, St. Lawrence was hurriedly prepared for action and recommissioned on 21 June 1861, Capt. Hugh Y. Purviance in command. She sailed for the Confederate coast eight days later but was delayed in the lower Delaware River by low tides until 8 July when she finally put to sea. After joining the Atlantic Blockading Squadron upon her arrival at Hampton Roads, she headed further south on the 14th. Two days later, she captured the British blockade runner, Herald, off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. That vessel had escaped from Beaufort, North Carolina, laden with naval stores and was bound for Liverpool. Capt. Purviance sent the prize to Hampton Roads and continued his voyage south. On the 28th, a lookout on the frigate spotted a schooner flying British colors and gave chase. Some four hours later, as St. Lawrence was overhauling the schooner, the fleeing vessel ran up the Confederate flag and fired three shots at her pursuer. One passed through the frigate's \\"mainsail and took a splinter out of the main yard.\\" St. Lawrence answered with her forecastle battery and hit the chase twice, once in her bow. Survivors from the schooner, which sank half an hour later, revealed that their ship had been the Confederate privateer, Petrel, of Charleston, South Carolina. Boats from St. Lawrence rescued all but two of the privateer's 38 crewmen and sent them north in the steamer . Destruction of the privateer Petrel by the USS St. Lawrence. The frigate proceeded south and blockaded off Savannah, Georgia, until returning to Hampton Roads in September. However, after minor repairs and taking on provisions, she headed back to blockade duty off the Georgia coast. On 19 October, when responsibility for blockading the Confederate Atlantic coast was divided in two, St. Lawrence was assigned to the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. On 6 November, she captured British schooner, Jenny Lee, of Nassau, New Providence, laden with rice and tobacco from Darien, Georgia, and headed for Nassau. St. Lawrence continued blockade duty, operating along the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina, until ordered north on 27 January 1862. After replenishing her ammunition, provisions and water at New York, the frigate sailed for the Virginia Capes for service in the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. =Battle of Hampton Roads= She reached Hampton Roads on 6 March and was on hand when Confederate ironclad, Virginia, (formerly ) attacked Union warships there two days later. On that fateful afternoon, gunboat , came alongside with word of the ram's raid and towed St. Lawrence toward the scene of the action. As the two ships passed Sewell's Point, Southern batteries there opened fire with shot and shell and made several hits, but did no serious damage. The two Union warships responded in kind. As they approached the battle scene, observers on the Union warships learned that had gone down, had surrendered, and had run hard aground. Then, St. Lawrence herself grounded. While Cambridge and tug, , were attempting to refloat the frigate, Virginia opened fire from some 900 yards distance. St. Lawrence replied with rapid fire, but her projectiles glanced harmlessly off the ironclad's greased armor. One 80 pound (36 kg) shell from Virginia penetrated St. Lawrence's starboard quarter just above the water line and did considerable damage to her wardroom pantry and to the Assistant Surgeon's stateroom. Toward dusk, Virginia retired, planning to resume the task of destroying the Union men-of-war after the return of daylight. About 2000, St. Lawrence was again afloat; and she withdrew to the anchorage at Fort Monroe. That night, arrived and took position near Minnesota, still hard aground. The following day, Virginia returned to Hampton Roads where she engaged Monitor in a historic battle which, although inconclusive, revolutionized naval warfare. After the battle in Hampton Roads, St. Lawrence served briefly in the Potomac River to protect the Federal capital from attack by sea. She returned to Hampton Roads late in April, but was reassigned to the East Gulf Blockading Squadron. St. Lawrence arrived at Key West, Florida on the 23rd and was soon at sea again looking for blockade runners operating between Cuba and the gulf coast. In July, she became flagship of the squadron, and she performed this duty until sailing north on 7 May 1863 because of a serious outbreak of yellow fever. The ship was decommissioned at Portsmouth Navy Yard on 30 May 1863. Recommissioned on 5 August, St. Lawrence sailed to Hampton Roads to become an ordnance ship for the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. In 1865, she served as a store ship at Norfolk where she was decommissioned on 12 December. Barracks ship, 1867-1875 In ordinary through 1866, the frigate was used as a barracks ship for marines at Norfolk from 1867 through 1875. On 31 December 1875, she was sold at Norfolk to E. Stannard. In literature In Robert Conroy's alternate history novel 1862, St. Lawrence is sunk by the Royal Navy steam sloop-of-war as revenge for the Trent Affair, bringing the United Kingdom into the American Civil War on the side of the Confederacy.

Then Joe Davitch came along and she was ‚Äúswept off my feet by a fully grown man, someone who...was already living his life.‚Äù Joe was a 33-year-old divorcee with 3 children whom Rebecca met at a friend‚Äôs party that happened to be at the Open Arms. One month later, Rebecca had quit college, had married Joe, and‚Äîas she quickly discovered‚Äîhad married the Davitch family, with Joe‚Äôs 3 daughters, his mother, his brother Zeb, his huge old Baltimore house (Open Arms) and its business as a venue for celebrations of all sorts‚Äîweddings, graduations, christenings, anniversaries, etc. Before too long she also discovers that she has become the de facto manager of the Open Arms and the mother of Joe‚Äôs 3 girls and their own new baby daughter. When Joe himself dies after only 6 years of marriage and Joe‚Äôs uncle Poppy moves in, she finds herself with even more responsibility. Having cheerfully and exhaustingly raised four daughters, run the ‚Äúcelebrations business,‚Äù and helped her daughters through 6 marriages (+ 2 divorces) and 7 grandchildren, Rebecca is now taking a breath to ask, ‚ÄúWhat happened to the 20-year young woman who was a serious scholar, politically-involved idealist, engaged to be engaged‚Ä¶.?‚Äù At an engagement party for one of her stepdaughters, Rebecca finds herself questioning everything about her life, and decides to take steps to resurrect her former self. Her self-improvement project includes a visit to her hometown in Virginia, picking up old hobbies, reading books that she had read in college, and renewing her intellectual interests, without abandoning her many matriarchal and professional duties. She also eventually gets reacquainted with her old college/high school sweetheart. Will Allenby is a somewhat stodgy and constricted person (much as he was in college, way \\"back when they were grownups\\") and is now a divorced physics professor working at the same nearby college that they had both attended. While Rebecca is touched by certain remembrances and traits of Will, her fantasy of re-kindling their old affections is spoiled by his sad, staid and inflexible demeanor. Rebecca eventually realizes that the path that she chose (or chose her) decades ago may have resulted in her \\"right person\\" after all. Reviews Beth Kephart: \\"Back When We Were Grownups is Tyler's fifteenth novel, and she is still not scrimping on wackiness and wit, on sentences of shocking originality, on wisdom. ...There's not a flat line in this book, not a single simple character, not a moment that isn't tapped for all its glorious possibilities. There is a party on almost every page, and there is also the party's aftermath. This is storytelling at its best and most breathtaking. Tyler, an acknowledged master of the form, is living up to her well-earned reputation.Kephart, Beth (2001) Book Review of Back When We Were Grownups, Book Magazine. \\"With Davitch, Tyler has created a character who is brave enough to look back on her life and to imagine herself making different kinds of choices. Brave enough to wonder what honesty looks like, whether there is ever really a single distillation of self that is unshakable and true....Anne Tyler has a talent for spinning out characters we care about, characters who go on living long after their stories end.Kephart, Beth (May 6, 2001) \\"Anne Tyler's 15th Grasps Peculiarity,\\" The Baltimore Sun. Publishers Weekly: \\"Tyler...has a gift for creating endearing characters, but readers should find Rebecca particularly appealing, for despite the blows she takes, she bravely keeps on trying. Tyler also has a gift...for unfurling intricate stories effortlessly, as if by whimsy or accident. The ease of her storytelling here is breathtaking, but almost unnoticeable because, rather like Rebecca, Tyler never calls attention to what she does. Late in the novel, Rebecca observes that her younger self had wanted to believe \\"that there were grander motivations in history than mere family and friends, mere domestic happenstance.\\" Tyler makes it plain: nothing could be more grand.\\" Publishers Weekly (2001). Tom Shone: \\"But then that's the thing about Anne Tyler novels: your certainty about how things are going to turn out in no way interferes with your desire to see them do so. Tyler's plots are the mere stuff of family albums, really‚Äîa procession of marriages, births, deaths. And yet her feel for character is so keen that even‚Ä¶readers who‚Ä¶.would happily fry the whole notion of ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù for breakfast‚Äîare reduced to the role of helpless gossips, swapping avid hunches about the possible fates of the characters. You're involved before you even notice you were paying attention.\\"Shone, Tom (May 14, 2001) ‚ÄúFamily Feelings,‚Äù The New Yorker Author's comments on novel and characters ‚ÄúI plotted Back When We Were Grownups just after emerging from a year in which there had been several losses and serious illnesses in my family. I wanted my next novel to be full of joy and celebration, which is how I ended up with a main character who earned her living throwing parties.

Gedi's location along the coast and association with similar sites along the Swahili Coast made it an important trade center. Although there are few historical documents specifically associating Gedi with Indian Ocean trade, the site is thought to have been one of the most important sites along the coast. Gedi's architecture and an abundance of imported material culture including pottery, beads, and coins provide evidence of the city's rising prosperity over the course of its occupation from as early as the eleventh century to its abandonment in the early seventeenth century.Wilson, Thomas H. \\"Spatial Analysis and Settlement Patterns on the Eastern African Coast\\" Mitteilungen zur Kulturkunde Bd. 28 (1982): 211.Pradines, Stephane. \\"Islamization and Urbanization on the Coast of East Africa: recent excavations at Gedi, Kenya.\\" Azania vol. 38 (2003): 181. https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00672700309480369 History of discovery and excavation Although Gedi remained unknown to most of British East Africa's colonists until the 1920s, the site was known by the local Mijikenda peoples. Currently, the Giriama, one of the Mijikenda tribes, maintain a large community around the Gedi ruins who view the site as a sacred and spiritual place.Deadly, Tucker. \\"The Interdependence of Gedi Ruins and the Giriama: A Study of Ancestral Spirits, Jinn, and the Impact of Islam.\\" Dickinson College, 2012. Despite changes in their belief system and the prominence of Islam in the region, evil and ancestral spirits are thought by many to reside at Gedi. According to local tradition, the ruins are protected by the spirits of its priests. These \\"Old Ones\\" are said to curse anyone who harms the site. The Gedi ruins were first discovered by colonialists in 1884 after a British resident of Zanzibar, Sir John Kirk, visited the site. However, the ruins remained obscured until their subsequent rediscovery in the 1920s, when the site began to gain attention from the British East African government. Initial excavations at Gedi began in the late-1940s, and the site today remains one of the most intensely studied Swahili Coast settlements. The significance of the ruins has been largely used to assess the site's role within the region in association with other sites to provide insight into the development of Swahili culture, the organization of Indian Ocean trade, the introduction and spread of Islam, and the political and economic ties between Swahili communities through their cultural remains and their spatial relationships.Pradines, Stephane. \\"Islamization and Urbanization on the Coast of East Africa: recent excavations at Gedi, Kenya.\\" Azania vol. 38 (2003): 180.Spear, Thomas. \\"Early Swahili History Reconsidered.\\" The International Journal of African Historical Studies vol. 33 no. 2 (2000): 261. DOI: 10.2307/220649 Early archaeological research Excavations commenced at Gedi in 1948 under the supervision of James Kirkman, lasting until 1958 with intermittent excavations occurring from the 1960s to the 1980s.Connah, Graham. African Civilizations: An Archaeological Perspective. 2nd ed. (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2001): 192. Kirkman excavated the buildings at the city's core, including the palace and several mosques and houses, and also cleared and repaired the walls. The Great Mosque was excavated in 1954 and the palace was excavated in 1963. Following his excavation of the Great Mosque, Kirkman's report \\"The Arab City of Gedi, The Great Mosque, Architecture and Finds\\" was published, followed by a series of monographs and papers.Kirkman, James. \\"Potters' Marks from Medieval Arab Sites in Kenya\\" The South African Archaeological Bulletin vol. 13 no. 52 (December 1958): 158. Along with the excavations at Gedi during the 1950s, concurrent excavations also took place at similar sites along the Swahili Coast.Kirkman, James. \\"Potters' Marks from Medieval Arab Sites in Kenya\\" The South African Archaeological Bulletin vol. 13 no. 52 (December 1958): 156. Wilson's 1982 survey of the 116 sites along the coast found 34 isolated ruins, which he concluded likely contained possible settlements or isolated dwellings.Wilson, Thomas H. \\"Spatial Analysis and Settlement Patterns on the Eastern African Coast\\" Mitteilungen zur Kulturkunde Bd. 28 (1982): 210. Although smaller settlements were studied, larger sites received the most attention.Wilson, Thomas H. \\"Spatial Analysis and Settlement Patterns on the Eastern African Coast\\" Mitteilungen zur Kulturkunde Bd. 28 (1982): 210‚Äì211. Other than Gedi, the site most intensively excavated was Ungwana at the mouth of the Tana River, which was similar in size to Gedi.Kirkman, J. S. \\"The Culture of the Kenya Coast in the Later Middle Ages: Some Conclusions from Excavations 1948‚Äì56.\\" The South African Archaeological Bulletin vol. 11 no. 44 (December 1956): 89. However, compared to sites similar in size, Gedi had one of the more densely populated urban centers. Recent archaeological research Since the 1990s archaeological research at Gedi and other Swahili coastal settlements has intensified. From the 1980s archaeological research increasingly began to focus more on the relationships between the coastal communities and their internal development, challenging the original notion that the development of the Swahili Coast was driven by foreign influence through Indian Ocean trade or by Arab colonists. Another important development in the study of Swahili coastal sites is the increased attention given to remains of structures that were not built of stone. Surveys of the open terrain at Gedi found dense concentrations of mud- thatched dwellings. In 2001, Stephane Pradines from the Institute Francias d'Archeologie Orientale and archaeologists from the National Museum of Kenya conducted a topographical survey of Gedi, which mapped the distribution of neighborhoods in order to investigate the site's urban development. Concurrently, Lynn Koplin conducted surveys of the mud-thatch neighborhoods, focusing on the area between the inner and outer walls.Reynolds, David West. \\"Swahili Ghost Town.\\" Archaeology vol. 54 no. 6 (November/December 2001): 46‚Äì47. From 2002 to 2003, research at Gedi continued to focus on urban development prior to the fifteenth century, with focus on a group of coral houses built by social elites in the site's urban core.  History of occupation  Stone slab with original Arabic inscriptions that was used to date the site The history of occupation at Gedi has been extrapolated as a result of excavations and historical documents pertaining to its material culture, architecture, and the known history of trade linking the Swahili Coast with the regions adjoining the Indian Ocean. The settlement of Gedi occurred long after the emergence of the earliest settlements along the Swahili Coast with the intensification of trade in the sixth century. The earliest evidence for occupation at Gedi is a grave marker that has been radiocarbon dated to between 1041 to 1278, placing the original settlement of the site sometime in the eleventh or early twelfth century. Gedi's participation in trade is believed to be the contributing factor in its founding and its later development into a city supporting an estimated population of 2,500 inhabitants at its peak. Despite the absence of historical documents specifically mentioning Gedi, it is considered to be one of the most important sites along the coast. Prior to the construction of the outer wall in the fifteenth century, the city initially developed in the northern section of the modern site. The adoption of Islam by the inhabitants in the twelfth century is marked by the presence of three superimposed mosques in the northern area the city, which were constructed during the twelfth to the fourteenth century. The style of architecture and the absence of minarets characteristic of all of Gedi's mosques has been used to suggest that the locals were influenced by the Ibadite denomination. From the eleventh through the fourteenth centuries, urban development at Gedi expanded primarily to the north, west and south with the eventual shift of the population around the Great Mosque during the fifteenth century. Gedi's population and prosperity peaked during the fifteenth and into the sixteenth century until it and many other coastal sites began to decline in the late-sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Gedi was abandoned by the middle of the seventeenth century. The presence of the Portuguese from the sixteenth century has been considered one of the primary factors in Gedi's eventual abandonment with their attempts to monopolize trade and due to armed intervention. However, a drop in the water table seen with the deepening of the well next to the Great Mosque, a Wazimba raid along the coast in 1589, and Galla migrations and raids from Somalia may have been additional factors in the abandonment of Gedi and most of the mainland coastal sites north of Mombasa.  Architecture  The Gedi ruins make up a site consisting of that lies in the primeval Arabuko-Sokoke Forest. The ancient town at Gedi is divided by two walls, with an outer wall enclosing and an inner wall enclosing . Within the inner wall there are two mosques, a palace or Sheikh's house, four large houses, several clustered houses, and four large pillar tombs comprising the urban core. The inner wall also encloses four other houses and three other mosques. Between the inner and outer walls few stone structures have been identified with the exception of two mosques. Immediately beyond the outer wall there is one mosque and several other unidentified structures. In addition to being divided by the inner and outer walls, which created an urban core occupied by the site's foremost buildings and areas of occupation between and outside of the outer wall, Gedi has a well-established infrastructure. Gedi's structures appear to be formally arranged in accordance with streets laid out in a grid pattern. Additionally the site contained sumps to collect storm water and lavatories in many of its primary buildings.Reynolds, David West. \\"Swahili Ghost Town.\\" Archaeology vol. 54 no. 6 (November/December 2001): 45 & 47. The majority of Gedi's structures were domestic residences made of thatched-roofed mud buildings concentrated between the outer and inner walls; however, the only buildings that survived to the present were constructed using coral stones extracted from the Indian Ocean. Although several of the buildings predate the fourteenth century, coral became a more common construction material for important structures and elite residences during that time period.Kirkman, J. S. \\"The Culture of the Kenya Coast in the Later Middle Ages: Some Conclusions from Excavations 1948‚Äì56.\\" The South African Archaeological Bulletin vol. 11 no. 44 (December 1956): 91.Spear, Thomas. \\"Early Swahili History Reconsidered.\\" The International Journal of African Historical Studies vol. 33 no. 2 (2000): 258. All of the buildings at Gedi are single-story structures. The walls and other coral structures were constructed in a similar manner using lime mortar, with most foundations no greater than one foot in depth and filled with stones. Where foundations were used, they tended to be no wider than the wall they supported. There are several examples of non-utilitarian design elements. Doorways for the buildings consist of square framed pointed archways, with tombs and mosques containing spandrels and architraves that have been carved or inlaid with porcelain. Walls The inner and outer walls were constructed similarly with the outer wall measuring nine feet high and 18 inches thick, which was also coated in plaster. The outer wall is believed to have been constructed during the fifteenth century. The construction of the inner wall has been attributed to the Portuguese presence along the coast in the sixteenth century, whilst the presence of gun ports has been used to infer that the walls were not constructed earlier. However, the practicality of the walls as defensive fortification is unclear, since according to Kirkman the walls and gates surrounding the town have no significant strength, which seems to conform to a proposal that the walls and the layout of buildings were used to maintain social barriers.Wilson, Thomas H. \\"Spatial Analysis and Settlement Patterns on the Eastern African Coast\\" Mitteilungen zur Kulturkunde Bd. 28 (1982): 213.Kirkman, J. S. \\"The Culture of the Kenya Coast in the Later Middle Ages: Some Conclusions from Excavations 1948‚Äì56.\\" The South African Archaeological Bulletin vol. 11 no. 44 (December 1956): 98. Although the inner wall has a more obvious defensive function and despite the absence of gun ports and the questionable strength of the outer wall, it has nonetheless been credited as being a fortification. Mosques The mosques at Gedi contained wells and washing facilities, which would have been used for cleansing prior to worship. However, they were not constructed with minarets used for the call to prayer, which was more characteristic in other regions. Gedi's mosques were typically laid out with anterooms flanking the central room, which had a roof supported by wood beams resting on square stone pillars. The isles created by the pillars obstructed the view of the mihrab, which were situated on the north walls in the direction of Mecca. At Gedi, two of the mosques have been dubbed \\"Great Mosques.\\" The mosque traditionally known as the Great Mosque is a rectangular building located within the inner wall, which was built during the fifteenth century. The Great Mosque has three entrances and three rows of pillars in the central room supporting the roof. Above one of the entrances is a relief of a spear point flanked by a shield on its spandrel, while on the east entrance the architrave is engraved with a herringbone pattern. The structure also has one of the deepest foundations, with its 21 inch wide walls extending four feet into the subsoil. The second Great Mosque resided in an older portion of the city, which was inhabited from the eleventh century and located to the north of the walled city. The structure that is standing was constructed in the fourteenth century on top of two earlier mosques from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The mosque measures in length along its north-south orientation. Tombs PIllar tomb at Gedi The pillar tombs at Gedi, which consist of masonry based structures topped with a pillar or column, are part of an architectural style of the medieval Swahili Coastal settlements. A common feature on the pillar tombs at Gedi are decorative recessed panels. Although there are four large pillar tombs at Gedi, the \\"dated tomb,\\" located within the inner wall, stands out from the rest since it has on Arabic inscription with the date A.H. 802 (A.D. 1399). Houses The surviving residential buildings at Gedi are all located within the inner wall and are representative of the living conditions of the elite members of Gedi society, since the majority of the population lived in the mud thatched dwellings outside the city's core. The four largest houses include the House on the Wall, the House on the West Wall, the House of the Dhow, and the Large House.Schofield, J. F. \\"The City of Gedi: Presidential Address.\\" The South African Archaeological Bulletin vol. 10 no. 38 (June 1955): 36. A cluster of smaller houses adjacent to the palace or Sheiks residence includes the House of the Chinese Cash, the House of the Porcelain Bowl, the House of the Cistern, the House of the Two Rooms, the House of the Paneled Walls, the House of the Scissors, the House of the Venetian Bead, the House of the Sunken Court, the House of the Cowries, the House of the Iron Lamp, the House of the Iron Box, and the House of the Well.Wilson, Thomas H. \\"Spatial Analysis and Settlement Patterns on the Eastern African Coast\\" Mitteilungen zur Kulturkunde Bd. 28 (1982): 212. Although the houses at Gedi vary in size, their number of rooms, and their layout, the basic house at the site is a three-room structure, which usually contained a forecourt and domestic court. With the three-room layout, there was usually a long main room with two storage and sleeping quarters towards the back of the house. One of the back rooms usually had a storage compartment near the roof with access through a trapdoor. Latrines, usually located toward the back of the main room, were also present in many of the houses, while wells were present in the courtyards of some of the houses. One of the oldest stone houses dates to the fourteenth century and has a long narrow sunken court, which contrasts the wider and deeper courts found in houses constructed during the fifteenth century.Kirkman, J. S. \\"The Culture of the Kenya Coast in the Later Middle Ages: Some Conclusions from Excavations 1948‚Äì56.\\" The South African Archaeological Bulletin vol. 11 no. 44 (December 1956): 94. The entrances of houses have a greater deal of variability in the configuration of their passageways, since many of the houses were highly concentrated and laid out to maximize the use of available space. The palace at Gedi Palace The palace, which housed the city's sheikh, had a large central room with two anterooms, each containing its own courtyard. A series of residential rooms were accessible from the main hall. There were also two additional courts, the audience court and the reception court, which were accessed through different gates.  Hinterland  Gedi also has a hinterland consisting of several smaller sites made up of either solitary mosques and tombs or several houses.Wilson, Thomas H. \\"Spatial Analysis and Settlement Patterns on the Eastern African Coast\\" Mitteilungen zur Kulturkunde Bd. 28 (1982): 215. The sites of Shaka and Kilepwa are nearby. Kilepwa, located on an island in Mida Creek, is closer to Gedi and consists of three stone houses. There is also an isolated mosque at the west end of the creek, a mosque at Watamu, and a mosque and tombs at Kiburugeni. Material culture Excavations at Gedi have uncovered numerous artifacts, but the most abundant and commonly discussed in literature are beads and ceramics, which have been used to identify trade and to obtain dates for the site's occupation. Many of the names given to the stone houses refer to the objects found within or in association with them including two Chinese coins, a porcelain bowl, scissors, a Venetian Bead, cowrie shells, an iron lamp, and an iron box. The material remains found at Gedi have been found to be similar to the remains at adjacent Swahili coastal settlements with the greatest degree of variation among the styles of pottery represented. Of eight sites examined by Kirkman, the sites of Gedi, Ungwana, and Kilepwa had nearly identical material remains prior to the fifteenth century, while the sites of Mnarani, the Pillar Tomb at Malindi, Takwa, Kinuni, and Kilindidni increasingly similar material culture over the course of the fifteenth through seventeenth centuries. In addition to local production, one of the major contributors to the presence of cultural materials found at the site is due to the importance of Indian Ocean trade, which assumed a growing role in East Africa at the beginning of the Islamic era in the seventh century.Killick, David. \\"A global perspective on the pyrotechnologies of Sub-Saharan Africa.\\" Azania vol. 51 no. 1 (January 2016) 67. Currency It is speculated that cowrie shells may have been the principal currency at Gedi. Cowrie shells have been recovered in the store rooms of the houses and found in greater abundance than struck coins, represented by only two coins of Chinese origin. The use of cowries as currency is supported by their historical use as tender in various parts of Africa, and Kirkman estimated the exchange rate of cowrie shells to the gold dinar to be 400,000 to 1.Kirkman, J. S. \\"The Culture of the Kenya Coast in the Later Middle Ages: Some Conclusions from Excavations 1948‚Äì56.\\" The South African Archaeological Bulletin vol. 11 no. 44 (December 1956): 99. However, there are examples of locally struck coins at contemporary sites, but none have been recovered at Gedi. The use of beads as a currency has also been proposed by J. F. Schofield, who claims that a decline in the number of beads recovered in the upper stratigraphic layers reflects a decline in their value around the fifteenth century.Schofield, J. F. \\"The City of Gedi: Presidential Address.\\" The South African Archaeological Bulletin vol. 10 no. 38 (June 1955): 40. Beads There are several classifications of beads common to the Swahili coastal settlements that have been found at Gedi.Schofield, J. F. \\"The City of Gedi: Presidential Address.\\" The South African Archaeological Bulletin vol. 10 no. 38 (June 1955): 37 & 39. In his examination of beads found at Gedi and the Limpopo Valley (Mapungubwe), Schofield placed beads into three categories: red, blue, green, and yellow cylinders made from cane glass; smaller black, red, green, yellow, and blue biconical and lenticular beads made from wound glass; and spheres of red, black, and yellow pressed glass. Kirkman similarly created eight classifications of beads.Schofield, J. F. \\"The City of Gedi: Presidential Address.\\" The South African Archaeological Bulletin vol. 10 no. 38 (June 1955): 39. All but 25 of the 558 beads categorized as class 1‚Äì3 were made from opaque glass. During his excavations at Gedi, Kirkman recovered 631 beads in six stratigraphic layers. Monochrome yellow, green, and black wound and pressed glass beads formed in melon, biconical, globular, barrel, and cylindrical shapes were the most common styles represented in strata from the fourteenth century and sporadically appeared in later levels. Small drawn cane glass beads are also commonly represented in fourteenth and fifteenth century levels with the colors green, opaque red, yellow, and black occurring more frequently than blue, brown, and red. It is believed that Islamic traders brought the majority of glass beads to East Africa, which were traded across the continent, since there is no evidence for local production or trade south or west of Egypt and Nubia with the exception of a site in Igbo Olokun Grove at Ile-Ife in southern Nigeria.Killick, David. \\"A global perspective on the pyrotechnologies of Sub-Saharan Africa.\\" Azania vol. 51 no. 1 (January 2016): 78. Pottery Numerous types and styles of ceramics have been found during the excavations at Gedi including Chinese porcelain, Islamic glazed ware, and locally produced earthenwares. Several examples of the ceramics recovered at Gedi are represented in different quantities at other coastal sites. Red slipped pottery is rare at Gedi, compared to other inland sites, while bowls with rounded bottoms, flat rims, and incised ornamentation on top of the rims are more common at Gedi.Kirkman, J. S. \\"The Culture of the Kenya Coast in the Later Middle Ages: Some Conclusions from Excavations 1948‚Äì56.\\" The South African Archaeological Bulletin vol. 11 no. 44 (December 1956): 94 & 99. White to cream colored bowls were also found in small quantities, along with an isolated pottery type that has a golden brown luster. A sherd with a trellis pattern is a possible import from the African interior.Kirkman, J. S. \\"The Culture of the Kenya Coast in the Later Middle Ages: Some Conclusions from Excavations 1948‚Äì56.\\" The South African Archaeological Bulletin vol. 11 no. 44 (December 1956): 91‚Äì92 & 94. =Imports= Ceramic that were imported to Gedi represent either direct or indirect trade with China, South Asia, and the Islamic world. Islamic pottery found at Gedi was wheel spun, glazed, and kiln fired, which includes sgraffiato, Yemeni black on yellow ceramics, and figured wares frequently depicting floral designs on blue and white panels.Spear, Thomas. \\"Early Swahili History Reconsidered.\\" The International Journal of African Historical Studies vol. 33 no. 2 (2000): 280. Sgraffiato is red-bodied earthenware with yellow or green glaze that was common in modern-day Iraq from the ninth to the sixteenth century. A type of polychrome stoneware from the sixteenth century characterized by grey, green, and brown glazes may have been made in Persia or India as an attempted imitation of Chinese porcelain. Another type of partially grey glazed bowls with circular decorations on their interior is believed to come from Indochina since the disappearance of the style coincides with the Thai conquest of the region in AD 1467.Kirkman, J. S. \\"The Culture of the Kenya Coast in the Later Middle Ages: Some Conclusions from Excavations 1948‚Äì56.\\" The South African Archaeological Bulletin vol. 11 no. 44 (December 1956): 92. Various types of Chinese pottery also appear at Gedi, including celadon and blue and white porcelain, which were found in large enough volumes to assume that a significant portion of the population had access to higher quality wares, while sherds were also found inlayed in the mosques. =Local wares= Pottery produced locally in East Africa was shaped by hand, unglazed, and assumed to be open fired, but it has been proposed that the absence of evidence for kilns may be the result of mistaking their remnants for metal furnaces. However, the absence of glazed and wheeled pottery illustrates that the inhabitants of the Swahili Coast did not adapt these technologies as a result of Indian Ocean trade, but were primarily the recipients of finished products in exchange for other local produce. Conversely, fifteen different potters' marks have been found at Gedi on pottery found on or near the surface of the site dating to the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, which has been used to suggest the site may have had a communal kiln at that time. The pots inscribed with the potters marks show the variation of different types and styles of ceramics over time, which were influenced by local production, as well as, the adaption of foreign design elements.Kirkman, James. \\"Potters' Marks from Medieval Arab Sites in Kenya\\" The South African Archaeological Bulletin vol. 13 no. 52 (December 1958): 159. Prior to the diversification of local styles and types, early ceramics at Gedi were more uniform and contained similarities with ceramics found at other coastal sites.Schofield, J. F. \\"The City of Gedi: Presidential Address.\\" The South African Archaeological Bulletin vol. 10 no. 38 (June 1955): 42. Despite the increase of imported ceramics in the fifteenth century, local varieties continued to be present in later levels of the sites occupation. =Ceramic chronology= In the fourteenth century, celadon was a prized import in East Africa, which was initially obtained from the Ming Dynasty in exchange for ivory.Kirkman, J. S. \\"The Culture of the Kenya Coast in the Later Middle Ages: Some Conclusions from Excavations 1948‚Äì56.\\" The South African Archaeological Bulletin vol. 11 no. 44 (December 1956): 95. However, knowledge of direct exchange with the Chinese is restricted to a single account of a Chinese fleet harbored off of Malindi and Mombasa between 1417 and 1419. The number of imports from China and elsewhere continued to increase throughout the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, represented by a large number of black on yellow Islamic wares and celadon.Kirkman, J. S. \\"The Culture of the Kenya Coast in the Later Middle Ages: Some Conclusions from Excavations 1948‚Äì56.\\" The South African Archaeological Bulletin vol. 11 no. 44 (December 1956): 94‚Äì95. Also during the fourteenth century, local wares began to diversify with Gedi's expanding economy. During the beginning and end of the fifteenth century, respectively, blue and white porcelain began to gradually replace celadon and monochrome Islamic wares completely replaced black on yellow types.Schofield, J. F. \\"The City of Gedi: Presidential Address.\\" The South African Archaeological Bulletin vol. 10 no. 38 (June 1955): 41. During the same century, local wares began to change with the reduction in the number of incised ornamental patterns and a shift to long necked-pots, compared to earlier short-necked variants.Kirkman, J. S. \\"The Culture of the Kenya Coast in the Later Middle Ages: Some Conclusions from Excavations 1948‚Äì56.\\" The South African Archaeological Bulletin vol. 11 no. 44 (December 1956): 96. In the following century, blue and white porcelain and monochrome Islamic wares became the dominant imports; a trend that began to emerge in the previous century and would continue until Gedi's decline in the seventeenth century. =Pottery associated with the dated tomb= The array of different types and styles of ceramic found during the excavations of Gedi provide information about the city's trade ties through the origin of imported vessels and aid in dating the site through seriation. At Gedi, a chronology has been established for the appearance of many of the ceramics, which have been found in deposits up to five feet. The dated tomb with an inscription connecting it to AD 1399 has served as a datum point for dating the stratigraphic layers. Celadon, Islamic monochromes, and blue and white Chinese porcelain were found in levels above the tomb, which date to the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Below the tomb, yellow and black Islamic wares were found down to the natural soil, while celadon was found in layers immediately below the tomb. The celadon below the tomb varied from the celadon found above the tomb, since carvings of lotus pedals were more common on the celadon in the lower layers. Given the date of the tomb, it was determined that the ceramics above the tomb dated to the fifteenth century, which helped extrapolate dates for the remaining stratigraphy. Economy Local industries and trades likely included pottery production, metal working, construction, spinning and weaving cloth, fishing, trade, and possibly the production of salt, which are represented in the archaeological and historical record at a number of coastal sites.Connah, Graham. African Civilizations: An Archaeological Perspective. 2nd ed. (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2001): 209. In addition, the local coral architecture using limestone mortar also indicates the presence of local trades associated with construction and masonry.Connah, Graham. African Civilizations: An Archaeological Perspective. 2nd ed. (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2001): 189 & 209. Food production at Gedi likely involved a mixed economy based on livestock, as well as agricultural and horticultural production. Some foods were introduced through trade.Connah, Graham. African Civilizations: An Archaeological Perspective. 2nd ed. (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2001): 188. Available crops included millet, African rice, cocoyam, coconuts, bananas, citrus fruits, pomegranates, figs, sugar cane, cotton, and various vegetables, while the principal livestock was likely cattle. Sheep, goats, and chickens played an important role as well. Swahili coastal settlements frequently conducted trade with the interior, obtaining goods for overseas trade or local consumption.Connah, Graham. African Civilizations: An Archaeological Perspective. 2nd ed. (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2001): 189. However, isolated and small settlements have been interpreted as hinterlands that developed around and supported the economies of the larger settlements. Small settlements or hamlets were established between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries within the vicinity of Gedi including sites at the end of Mida Creek, Kiburugeni, Watamu, Shaka, and Kilepwa. These smaller settlements are thought to represent agricultural communities that provided Gedi with most of its agricultural produce.Wilson, Thomas H. \\"Spatial Analysis and Settlement Patterns on the Eastern African Coast\\" Mitteilungen zur Kulturkunde Bd. 28 (1982): 215‚Äì216. Maritime trade The history of maritime trade along the coast of East Africa dates to the Classical Period. The Periplus Maris Erthraei, written by an Egyptian- Greek merchant circa AD 40‚Äì55, described trading ports along the Indian Ocean including Azania, a historic designation of the East African coast extending southward to present day Tanzania.Spear, Thomas. \\"Early Swahili History Reconsidered.\\" The International Journal of African Historical Studies vol. 33 no. 2 (2000): 279.Connah, Graham. African Civilizations: An Archaeological Perspective. 2nd ed. (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2001): 200. Physical evidence for trade predates the earliest towns in the ninth century with the discovery of four Roman beads from the fourth century and pottery from the fifth century.Spear, Thomas. \\"Early Swahili History Reconsidered.\\" The International Journal of African Historical Studies vol. 33 no. 2 (2000): 262.Connah, Graham. African Civilizations: An Archaeological Perspective. 2nd ed. (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2001): 201. Roman documents from the first through fifth centuries, as well as, Ptolemy's Geographia also provide historical accounts of trade with East Africa, followed by a dearth of historical documents until the tenth century. After the fall of the Roman Empire in the fifth century, Arab, Indian, and Chinese shipping grew in importance, which was eventually dominated by Persia after its conquest of southern Arabia and Egypt in AD 515 and AD 616. It has been proposed that trade between the Swahili Coast and Persia, as well as later Islamic merchants following the spread of Islam after AD 632, contributed to the settlement and development of the coastal sites. Gedi's participation in maritime trade can be seen in the increasing frequency of imports found at Gedi over the course of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Conditions along the Atlantic coast prevented European nations from opening sea lanes until the early-sixteenth century, limiting maritime trade to states with easy access to the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean.Connah, Graham. African Civilizations: An Archaeological Perspective. 2nd ed. (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2001): 182. Many artifacts found at Gedi including much of the ceramics, all the beads, and the two Chinese coins resulted from either direct or indirect trade with the Near East, Arabia, China, India, and Indochina. Swahili coastal settlements exported gold, ivory, slaves, ebony, mangrove poles, copper, copal gum, frankincense, myrrh, and crystal rock. Maritime trade along the coast of East Africa was facilitated by trade winds in the Indian Ocean, as well as relatively short distances between land masses. Gedi and other large, contemporary mainland sites often had poor anchorages compared to later sites along the coast, considering the exposure of their shorelines, availability of sheltered harbors, and water depth upon approach.Wilson, Thomas H. \\"Spatial Analysis and Settlement Patterns on the Eastern African Coast\\" Mitteilungen zur Kulturkunde Bd. 28 (1982): 213 & 215. However, despite reduced access to good anchorage, Gedi and other large mainland sites were able to maintain a high degree of economic success. Their success in trade may have been influenced by the early establishment of trade routes and available commercial support from their hinterlands.  Conservation and administration  Gedi was made a historic monument in 1927. The site was declared a protected monument in 1929, after looters began removing Chinese porcelain inset as architectural decoration. In 1939, the Kenya Public Works Department began restoring structures that were at the greatest risk of collapse. Further site restoration, primarily clearing vegetation overgrowth, was conducted in 1948‚Äì1959 by James Kirkman, who was appointed warden of the site after Gedi and the surrounding forest was declared a national park in 1948.James Kirkman, \\"Gedi\\", 8th edition, 1975, Rodwell Press In 1969, stewardship of Gedi was turned over to the National Museums of Kenya. The site is currently administered by the museum's Department of Coastal Archaeology.Reynolds, David West. \\"Swahili Ghost Town.\\" Archaeology vol. 54 no. 6 (November/December 2001): 44.

Description A keepalive signal is often sent at predefined intervals, and plays an important role on the Internet. After a signal is sent, if no reply is received the link is assumed to be down and future data will be routed via another path until the link is up again. A keepalive signal can also be used to indicate to Internet infrastructure that the connection should be preserved. Without a keepalive signal, intermediate NAT-enabled routers can drop the connection after timeout. Since the only purpose is to find links that don't work or to indicate connections that should be preserved, keepalive messages tend to be short and not take much bandwidth. However, their precise format and usage terms depend on the communication protocol. TCP keepalive Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) keepalives are an optional feature, and if included must default to off. The keepalive packet contains no data. In an Ethernet network, this results in frames of minimum size (64 bytes). There are three parameters related to keepalive: * Keepalive time is the duration between two keepalive transmissions in idle condition. TCP keepalive period is required to be configurable and by default is set to no less than 2 hours. * Keepalive interval is the duration between two successive keepalive retransmissions, if acknowledgement to the previous keepalive transmission is not received. * Keepalive retry is the number of retransmissions to be carried out before declaring that remote end is not available When two hosts are connected over a network via TCP/IP, TCP Keepalive Packets can be used to determine if the connection is still valid, and terminate it if needed. Most hosts that support TCP also support TCP Keepalive. Each host (or peer) periodically sends a TCP packet to its peer which solicits a response. If a certain number of keepalives are sent and no response (ACK) is received then the sending host will terminate the connection from its end. If a connection has been terminated due to a TCP Keepalive time-out and the other host eventually sends a packet for the old connection, the host that terminated the connection will send a packet with the RST flag set to signal the other host that the old connection is no longer active. This will force the other host to terminate its end of the connection so a new connection can be established. Typically TCP Keepalives are sent every 45 or 60 seconds on an idle TCP connection, and the connection is dropped after 3 sequential ACKs are missed. This varies by host, e.g. by default Windows PCs send the first TCP Keepalive packet after 7200000ms (2 hours), then sends 5 Keepalives at 1000ms intervals, dropping the connection if there is no response to any of the Keepalive packets. Keepalive on higher layers Since TCP keepalive is optional, various protocols (e.g. SMB and TLS) implement their own keep-alive feature on top of TCP. It is also common for protocols which maintain a session over a connectionless protocol, e.g. OpenVPN over UDP, to implement their own keep- alive. Other uses=HTTP keepalive The Hypertext Transfer Protocol uses the keyword \\"Keep-Alive\\" in the \\"Connection\\" header to signal that the connection should be kept open for further messages (this is the default in HTTP 1.1, but in HTTP 1.0 the default was to use a new connection for each request/reply pair). Despite the similar name, this function is entirely unrelated. Other devices \\"Keep-alive\\" devices are used in automotive repair to maintain battery voltage for devices in the vehicle when the battery is disconnected or changed, usually by plugging in a small battery to the vehicle's 12 volt power outlet. A typical application is preventing the vehicle's radio or other device from going to \\"code\\" mode (security lockout) during vehicle repair. Typically a lower voltage source, such as a 9‚Äìvolt battery, is sufficient for the purpose. Electric clocks often have battery- powered keep-alive circuits to maintain time and other settings during a power outage. Some electronic devices use a capacitor circuit to maintain volatile memory when the user changes the battery.

The term can also be applied to human women with a certain amount of spiritual development. The Sanskrit term is related to ' - to fly, as in ' (meaning flight). The Tibetan term means \\"skygoer\\" and may have originated in the Sanskrit khecara, a term from the Cakrasa·πÉvara Tantra. Dakinis are often represented as consorts in Yab-Yum representations. The masculine form of the word is ', which is usually translated into Tibetan as pawo \\"hero\\" (). Tibetan board carving of the ·∏çƒÅkinƒ´ Vajrayogini. The ·∏çƒÅkinƒ´ (and the ·∏çƒÅka) appeared in medieval legends in India (such as in the Bhagavata Purana, Brahma Purana, Markandeya Purana and Kathasaritsagara) as a demon in the train of Kali who feeds on human flesh.Monier-Williams, A Sanskrit Dictionary 1899 Devi Kavacham in Marakandeya Purana provides protection against Dakini and others.https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_devii/durga700.html?lang=sahttp://webstock.in/001-Epics- PDF/Durga-Saptashati-Sanskrit-Hindi/001-Durga-Saptashati-Sanskrit-Hindi.pdf As a key tantric figure, the ·∏çƒÅkinƒ´ does appear in Tangmi; the ·∏çƒÅkinƒ´ figure disseminated into Japanese culture from Shingon Buddhism, evolving into the dakini-ten (\\"ten\\" means \\"deva\\" in Japanese), becoming linked to the kitsune iconography. The ·∏çƒÅkinƒ´ appears in a Vajrayana formulation of the Buddhist refuge formula known as the Three Roots. Sometimes she appears as the dharmapala, alongside a guru and yidam. ::The dakini, in her various guises, serves as each of the Three Roots. She may be a human guru, a vajra master who transmits the Vajrayana teachings to her disciples and joins them in samaya commitments. The wisdom dakini may be a yidam, a meditational deity; female deity yogas such as Vajrayogini are common in Tibetan Buddhism. Or she may be a protector; the wisdom dakinis have special power and responsibility to protect the integrity of oral transmissions\\" The archetypal ·∏çƒÅkinƒ´ in Tibetan Buddhism is Yeshe Tsogyal, consort of Padmasambhava. In Buddhism=In Tibetan Buddhism Although ·∏çƒÅkinƒ´ figures appear in Hinduism and Bon, ·∏çƒÅkinƒ´s occur most notably in Vajrayana Buddhism and especially Tibetan Buddhism. The khandroma, generally of volatile or wrathful temperament, acts somewhat as spiritual muse for spiritual practice. Dakinis are energetic beings in female form, evocative of the movement of energy in space. In this context, the sky or space indicates ≈õ≈´nyatƒÅ, the insubstantiality of all phenomena, which is, at the same time, the pure potentiality for all possible manifestations. =Classes of ·∏çƒÅkinƒ´= Judith Simmer-Brown, based on teachings she received from Tibetan lamas, identifies four main classes of ·∏çƒÅkinƒ´. These follow the twilight language tradition of esoteric Buddhism in referring to secret, inner, outer and outer-outer classes of ·∏çƒÅkinƒ´s. # The secret class of ·∏çƒÅkinƒ´ is prajnaparamita (Tibetan yum chenmo), the empty nature of reality according to Mahayana doctrine. # The inner class of ·∏çƒÅkinƒ´ is the ·∏çƒÅkinƒ´ of the mandala, a meditational deity (Tibetan:yidam) and fully enlightened Buddha who helps the practitioner recognise their own Buddhahood. # The outer ·∏çƒÅkinƒ´ is the physical form of the ·∏çƒÅkinƒ´, attained through completion stage tantra practices such as the Six Yogas of Naropa that work with the subtle winds of the subtle body so that the practitioner's body is compatible with an enlightened mind. # The outer-outer ·∏çƒÅkinƒ´ is a ·∏çƒÅkinƒ´ in human form. She is a yogini in her own right but may also be a karmamudrƒÅ, or consort, of a yogi or mahasiddha. Dakinis can also be classified according to the Trikaya, or three bodies of buddhahood. # The DharmakƒÅya ·∏çƒÅkinƒ´, which is Samantabhadrƒ´, represents the dharmadhatu where all phenomena appear. # The SambhogakƒÅya ·∏çƒÅkinƒ´s are the yidams used as meditational deities for tantric practice. # The NirmanakƒÅya ·∏çƒÅkinƒ´s are human women born with special potentialities; these are realized yoginis, consorts of gurus, or even all women in general as they may be classified into the Five Buddha Families.Cf. Capriles, El√≠as (2003/2007). Buddhism and Dzogchen, and Capriles, El√≠as (2006/2007). Beyond Being, Beyond Mind, Beyond History, vol. I, Beyond Being' =In Dzogchen= Dancing ·∏çƒÅkinƒ´, Tibet, c. 19th century When considered as a stage on the Vajrayana Path, the ·∏çƒÅkinƒ´ is the final stages: the first is the guru, which corresponds to the initial realization of the true condition of reality, as this is introduced by the guru in the empowerment, if the disciple obtains what the Inner Tantras call peyi yeshe () or the clarity of shunyata. The second is the devata, which corresponds to the meditation insofar as the devata is the method used for developing the state discovered in the initial realization of the true condition of reality. The third stage is the ·∏çƒÅkinƒ´ insofar as the ·∏çƒÅkinƒ´ is the source of the activities based on the realization of the guru and the meditation of the devata. In Dzogchen these three correspond to tawa (lta ba), gompa (sgom pa) and ch√∂pa (spyod pa): the first is the direct vision of the true nature of reality rather than an intellectual view of reality, as is the case with the term in other vehicles; the second is the continuity of this vision in sessions of meditation; and the third is the continuity of this vision in everyday activities. As a tantric practice, imperfections are utilised to make the vision uninterrupted. As the Base, the ·∏çƒÅkinƒ´s are the energies of life; as the Path, they are the activities of advanced practitioners; as the Fruit, they are the actionless activities of realized Masters. =In Anuttarayoga Tantra= Being associated with energy in all its functions, ·∏çƒÅkinƒ´s are linked with the revelation of the Anuttarayoga Tantras, which represent the path of transformation, whereby the energy of negative emotions or kleshas, called poisons, is transformed into the luminous energy of enlightened awareness yielding the most profound experience of clear light. Thubten Yeshe explains: > When the completion stage practices have been mastered and we have gained > control over our subtle energy winds and so forth, there will come a time > when the dakas and dakinis will come... physically embracing such a consort > is necessary to bring all the pervading energy winds into the central > channel, a prerequisite for opening the heart center and experiencing the > profoundest level of clear light. =Daka= In some instances, the terms ·∏çƒÅka and ·∏çƒÅkinƒ´ have been used for practitioners of tantric yoga themselves. In other instances, just ·∏çƒÅkinƒ´ was used for female practitioners, while male practitioners were just known as yogi. Padmasambhava was known as a yogi and Yeshe Tsogyal, a Tibetan princess, yogini and consort of Padmasambhava, as a ·∏çƒÅkinƒ´. Miranda Shaw, associate professor of religion at University of Richmond, said in an interview in 1995, \\"In Sanskrit there is only one word, Dakini. There are only female Dakinis... there is no male Dakini. It is an impossibility and a contradiction in terms.\\" Whereas Jan Willis in the chapter ·∏êƒÅkinƒ´; Some Comments on Its Nature and Meaning points out that \\"'she' is not 'female'. Though the ·∏çƒÅkinƒ´ assuredly most often appears in female form... this is but one of the myriad of ways Absolute Insight chooses to make manifest its facticity\\". Tibetan Lamas trained in the Gelug school, such as Sermey Khensur Lobsang Tharchin and Kelsang Gyatso, and those of the Karma Kagyu school such as Khenpo Karthar Rinpoche, write freely of \\"dakas and dakinis\\". Thubten Yeshe clarifies their meaning: \\"what are dakas and dakinis? Simply speaking they are males and females who possess advanced experiences of tantric transformation and control and are therefore able to increase the blissful wisdom of a highly qualified practitioner\\". In Japanese Buddhism Dakini-ten in Japan She always appears in the form of riding on a white fox. 1783 Although the ·∏çƒÅkinƒ´ imagery appears to have come to Japan via K≈´kai's introduction of Tangmi in Shingon Buddhism in the early 9th century; her form appears more like the ·∏çƒÅkinƒ´s of Hindu iconography than those found in Tibetan Buddhism. During the decline of the Heian period, the ·∏çƒÅkinƒ´ image was mixed together with images of foxes and half-naked women, acquiring the names , , and . In the Middle Ages, the Emperor of Japan would chant before an image of the fox Dakini-ten during his Enthronement, and both the sh≈çgun and the emperor would venerate Dakini-ten whenever they saw it, as it was a common belief at the time that ceasing to pay respects to Dakini-ten would cause the immediate ruin of the regime. Although Dakini-ten was said to be a powerful Buddhist deity, the images and stories surrounding it in Japan in both medieval and modern times are drawn from local kitsune mythology. The modern folk belief, often printed in Japanese books about religion, is that the fox image was a substitute for the Indian jackal, but the black jackal and other black animals are associated with Kali. As another example of the connection between Dakini- ten and the government of Japan, in the Genpei J≈çsuiki it is claimed that Taira no Kiyomori met a kitsune on the road and that his subsequent performance of Dakini-ten rites caused him to rise from an unimportant clan leader to the ruler of the entire nation. In the early modern period, the ·∏çƒÅkinƒ´ rite devolved into various spells called Dakini-ten, Atago Gongen. Those who felt wronged in their village could go to a corrupt yamabushi who practiced black magic, and get him to trap a kitsune and cause it to possess a third party. Reports of possession became especially common in the Edo and Meiji periods. For details, see kitsunetsuki.

They were killed by members of the Cayuse tribe who accused him of having poisoned 200 Cayuse in his medical care. The incident began the Cayuse War. It took place in southeastern Washington state near the town of Walla Walla, Washington and was one of the most notorious episodes in the U.S. settlement of the Pacific Northwest. Whitman had helped lead the first wagon train to cross Oregon's Blue Mountains and reach the Columbia River via the Oregon Trail, and this incident was the climax of several years of complex interaction between him and the local Indians.Drury, Clifford M. \\"Marcus and Narcissa Whitman and the Opening of Old Oregon.\\" Volume 1, Chapter 8. Seattle: Northwest Interpretive Association, 2005. The story of the massacre shocked the United States Congress into action concerning the future territorial status of the Oregon Country, and the Oregon Territory was established on August 14, 1848. The killings are usually ascribed in part to a clash of cultures and in part to the inability of Whitman, a physician, to halt the spread of measles among the Indians. The Cayuse held Whitman responsible for subsequent deaths. The incident remains controversial to this day; the Whitmans are regarded by some as pioneer heroes, while others see them as settlers who had attempted to impose their religion on the Indians and otherwise intrude, even allegedly poisoning them. Background A Cayuse tribe member Sahaptin nations came into direct contact with whites several decades before the arrival of the members of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM). These relations set expectations among the Cayuse for how exchanges and dialogue with whites would operate. Primarily the early Euro-Americans engaged in the North American fur trade and the Maritime fur trade. Marine captains regularly gave small gifts to indigenous merchants as a means to encourage commercial transactions. Later land-based trading posts, operated by the Pacific Fur Company, the North West Company and the Hudson's Bay Company, regularized economic and cultural exchanges, including gift giving. Interactions were not always peaceful. Native Americans suspected that the whites had power over the new diseases that they suffered. Reports from the period note that members of the Umpqua, Makah, and Chinookan nations faced threats of destruction through white-carried illnesses, as the natives had no immunity to these new infectious diseases.Whaley, Gray. Oregon and the Collapse of Illahee U.S. Empire and the Transformation of an Indigenous World, 1792-1859. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2010. p. 94. After becoming the premier fur gathering operation in the region, the HBC continued to develop ties on the Columbian Plateau. Historian Cameron Addis recounted that after 1840, much of the Columbian Plateau was no longer important in the fur trade and that: > ... most of its people were not dependent on agriculture, but traders had > spread Christianity for thirty years. When Catholic and Protestant > missionaries arrived they met Indians already content with their blend of > Christianity and native religions, skeptical toward farming, and wary of the > whites' apparent power to inflict diseases. Local Indians expected trade and > gifts (especially tobacco) as part of any interaction with whites, religious > or medical.Addis, Cameron. \\"The Whitman Massacre: Religion and Manifest > Destiny on the Columbia Plateau, 1809-1858\\", Journal of the Early Republic > 25, No. 2 (2005), pp. 221-258. Establishment of the mission Samuel Parker and Marcus Whitman journeyed overland in 1835 from the Rocky Mountains into portions of the modern states of Idaho, Oregon, and Washington to locate potential mission locations. Parker hired a translator from Pierre-Chrysologue Pambrun, manager of the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) trading post Fort Nez Perc√©s. He wanted help in consulting with the elite of the Liksiyu (Cayuse) and Niim√≠ipu (Nez Perce) in order to identify particular places for missions and Christian proselytizing. During specific negotiations over what became the Waiilatpu Mission, six miles from the site of the present-day city of Walla Walla, Washington, Parker told the assembled Cayuse men that: > I do not intend to take your lands for nothing. After the Doctor [Whitman] > is come, there will come every year a big ship, loaded with goods to be > divided among the Indians. Those goods will not be sold, but given to you. > The missionaries will bring you plows and hoes, to teach you how to > cultivate the land, and they will not sell, but give them to you.\\"Brouillet, > J.

Henry Spalding and Eliza Hart Spalding. The wives were the first known white American women to enter the Pacific Northwest overland. HBC Chief Factor Dr. John McLoughlin advised against the missionaries residing on the Columbia Plateau, but offered material support for their venture regardless. In particular, he allowed the women to reside at Fort Vancouver that winter as the men went to begin work on constructing the Waiilatpu Mission.Whitman, Marcus. \\"To Rev. Greene: May 5, 1837.\\" Whitman Mission. November 11, 1841. Accessed September 17, 2015. Because the beaver population of the Columbian Plateau had declined, British fur trading activities were being curtailed. Despite this, the HBC practices during previous decades shaped the perceptions and expectations of the Cayuse in relation to the missionaries. Whitman was frustrated because the Cayuse always emphasized commercial exchanges. In particular, they requested that he purchase their stockpiles of beaver skins, at rates comparable to those at Fort Nez Perc√©s. The Mission supplies were, in general, not appealing enough to the Sahaptin to serve as compensation for their labor. Whitman lacked sizable stockpiles of gunpowder, tobacco, or clothing, so he had to assign most labor to Hawaiian Kanaka (who had settled after working as sailors) or whites.Whitman, Marcus. To Rev. Greene: October 15, 1840. Whitman Mission. October 15, 1840. Accessed September 8, 2015. To bolster food supplies for the first winter, Whitman purchased several horses from the Cayuse. Additionally, the initial plowing of the Waiilatpu farm was done primarily with draft animals loaned by a Cayuse noble and Fort Nez Perc√©s. The missionary family suffered from a lack of privacy, as the Cayuse thought nothing of entering their quarters. Narcissa complained that the kitchen was \\"always filled with four or five or more Indians-men-especially at meal time ... \\" and said that once a room was established specifically for Indigenous that the missionaries would \\"not permit them to go into the other part of the house at all ... \\". According to Narcissa, the Natives were \\"so filthy they make a great deal of cleaning wherever they go ... \\" She wrote that \\"we have come to elevate them and not to suffer ourselves to sink down to their standard.\\" In the beginning of 1842, when the Cayuse returned to the vicinity of Waiilatpu after winter, the Whitmans told the tribesmen to establish a house of worship for their use. The Cayuse noblemen disagreed, stating that the existing mission buildings were sufficient. The Whitmans tried to explain that \\"we could not have them worship there for they would make it so dirty and fill it so full of fleas that we could not live in it.\\" The Cayuse who visited the Whitman's found Narcissa's haughtiness and Marcus' refusal to hold sermons in the mission household to be rude. Marcus Whitman Narcissa Whitman Land ownership dispute The Cayuse allowed construction of the mission, in the belief that Parker's promises still held. During the summer of 1837, a year after construction had started, the Whitmans were called upon to make due payment. The chief who owned the surrounding land was named Umtippe. Whitman balked at his demands and refused to fulfill the agreement, insisting that the land had been granted to him free of charge.Whitman, Marcus. To Rev. Greene: November 11, 1841. Whitman Mission. November 11, 1841. Accessed September 8, 2015. Umtippe returned the following winter to again demand payment, along with medical attention for his sick wife. He informed Whitman that \\"Doctor, you have come here to give us bad medicines; you come to kill us, and you steal our lands. You had promised to pay me every year, and you have given me nothing. You had better go away; if my wife dies, you shall die also.\\" Cayuse men continued to complain to HBC traders of Whitman's refusal to pay for using their land and of his preferential treatment of incoming white colonists.Brouillet (1869), p. 27. In particular, the Cayuse leader impeded Gray's cutting of timber intended for various buildings at Waiilatpu. He demanded payment for the lumber and firewood gathered by the missionaries. These measures were intended to delay the use of the wood resources, as a settler in the Willamette Valley had suggested to the noble that he would establish a trading post in the vicinity. During 1841, Tiloukaikt kept his horses within the Waiilatpu farm, earning Whitman's enmity as the horses destroyed the maize crop. Whitman claimed that the farmland was specifically for the mission and not for roving horses. Tiloukaikt told the doctor \\" ... that this was his land, that he grew up here and that the horses were only eating up the growth of the soil; and demanded of me what I had ever paid him for the land.\\" Aghast at the demands, Whitman told Tiloukaikt that \\"I never would give him anything ... \\" During the start of 1842, Narcissa reported that the Cayuse leaders \\"said we must pay them for their land we lived on.\\"Narcissa Whitman to Rev. Mrs. H. K. W. Perkins, May 2, 1840. Whitman, Narcissa Prentiss. The Letters of Narcissa Whitman. Fairfield, WA: Ye Galleon Press, 1986. A common complaint was that Whitman sold wheat to settlers, while giving none to the Cayuse landholders and demanding payment from them for using his grist mill. Conversion efforts The Catholic Church dispatched two priests in 1838 from the Red River colony to minister to the spiritual needs of both the regional Indigenous and Catholic settlers. Fran√ßois Norbert Blanchet and Modeste Demers arrived at Fort Nez Perc√©s on 18 November 1839.Blanchet, Francis Norbert Historical sketches of the Catholic Church in Oregon, Portland, OR: 1878, p. 35. This began a long-lasting competition between the ABCFM and the Catholic missionaries to convert the Sahaptin peoples to Christianity. While Blanchet and Demers were at the trading post for one day, they preached to an assembled group of Walla Wallas and Cayuse. Blanchet would later allege that Whitman had ordered local natives against attending their service. Whitman contacted the agent McLoughlin to complain of the Catholic activity. McLoughlin responded saying he had no oversight of the priests, but would advise them to avoid the Waiilaptu area.Whitman, Marcus. To Rev. Walker: December 27, 1839. Whitman Mission. December 27, 1839. Accessed September 17, 2015. The rival missionaries competed for the attention of Cayuse noble Tawatoy. He was present when the Catholic priests held their first Mass at Fort Nez Perc√©s. Demers returned to the trading post for two weeks in the summer of 1839.Blanchet (1878), p. 93. One of Tawatoy's sons was baptized at this time and Pierre-Chrysologue Pambrun was named as his godfather. According to Whitman, the Catholic priest forbade Tawatoy from visiting him. While Tawatoy did occasionally visit Whitman, he avoided the Protestant's religious services.Whitman, Marcus. To Rev. Greene: March 27, 1840. Whitman Mission. March 27, 1840. Accessed September 17, 2015. Also, the headman gave the Catholics a small house which Pambrun had built for him, for their use for religious services. After Demers left the area in 1840, Whitman preached to assembled Cayuse on several occasions, saying that they were in a \\"lost ruined and condemned state ... in order to remove the hope that worshipping will save them.\\" While he faced threats of violence for denying the power of worship,Whitman, Marcus. To Rev. Greene: October 29, 1840. Whitman Mission. October 29, 1840. Accessed September 17, 2015. Whitman continued to tell the Cayuse that their interpretation of Christianity was wrong. Whitman had opposed closing the Waiilatpu Mission, as suggested by Asa Bowen Smith in 1840, because he thought it would allow \\"the Catholics to unite all the [Pacific] coast from California to the North ... \\" Religious strife continued between the two Christian denominations. Cayuse and related natives \\"brought under papal influences\\" was, according to the ABCFM board, \\"manifest less confidence in the ceremonies of that delusive system.\\"American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (1845), pp. 212-213. Despite this claim, in 1845 the board admitted that no Cayuse had formally joined the churches maintained by ABCFM missionaries.American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (1845), p. 187. Henry Spalding and other anti-Catholic ministers later claimed that the Whitman killings were instigated by Catholic priests. According to their accounts, the Catholics may have told the Cayuse that Whitman had caused disease among their people and incited them to attack. Spalding and other Protestant ministers suggested that the Catholics wanted to take over the Protestant mission, which Whitman had refused to sell to them. They accused Fr. Pierre-Jean De Smet of being a party to such provocations. Agriculture Whitman and his fellow missionaries urged the adjacent Plateau peoples to learn to adopt European-American style agriculture, and settle on subsistence farms. This topic was a common theme in their dispatches to the Secretary of ABCFM, Rev. David Greene. Trying to persuade the Cayuse to abandon their seasonal migrations consumed much of Whitman's time. He believed that if they would cultivate their food supply through farming, they would remain in the vicinity of Waiilaptu. He told his superiors that if the Cayuse would abandon their habit of relocating during the winter, he could spend more time proselytizing among them. In particular, Whitman told Rev. Green that \\" ... although we bring the gospel as the first object we cannot gain an assurance unless they are attracted and retained by the plough and hoe ... \\"Whitman, Marcus. To Rev. Greene: May 8, 1838. Whitman Mission. May 8, 1838. Accessed September 17, 2015. In 1838 Whitman wrote about his plans to begin altering the Cayuse diet and lifestyle. He asked to be supplied with a large stockpile of agricultural equipment, so that he could lend it to interested Cayuse. He also needed machinery to use in a grist mill to process any wheat produced. Whitman believed that a mill would be another incentive for the Cayuse nation to stay near Waiilaptu.Whitman, Marcus. To Rev. Greene: October 5, 1838. Whitman Mission. October 5, 1838. Accessed September 17, 2015. To allow him some freedom from secular tasks, Whitman began to ask that a farmer be hired to work at his station and advise the Cayuse. The Cayuse started to harvest various acreages of crops originally provided to them by Whitman. Despite this, they continued their traditional winter migrations. The ABCFM declared in 1842 that the Cayuse were still \\" ... addicted to a wandering life\\".American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. Annual Report: Volumes 32-36. Boston: 1845. Vol. 33, p. 194. The board said that the natives were \\"not much inclined to change their mode of life ... \\" During the winter of 1843-44, food supplies were short among the Cayuse. As the ABCFM recounted: > The novelty of working for themselves and supplying their own wants seem to > have passed away; while the papal teachers and other opposers of the mission > appear to have succeeded in making them believe that the missionaries ought > to furnish them with food and clothing and supply all their wants. Rising tensions Sketch of the mission An additional point of contention between Whitman and the Cayuse was the missionaries' use of poisons. John Young, an immigrant from the United States, reported two cases in particular that strained relations.Brouillet (1869), p. 30. In 1840, he was warned by William Gray of the mission melon patch, the larger of them poisoned. This was from Cayuse taking the produce, to safeguard the patch Gray stated that he \\" ... put a little poison ... in order that the Indians who will eat them might be a little sick ... \\" During the winter of 1846, Young was employed on the mission sawmill. Whitman gave him instructions to place poisoned meat in the area surrounding Waiilatpu to kill Northwestern wolves. Several Cayuse ate the deadly meat but survived. Tiloukaikt visited Waiilatpu after the people recovered, and said that if any of the sick Cayuse had died, he would have killed Young. Whitman reportedly laughed when told of the conversation, saying he had warned the Cayuse several times of the tainted meat. Measles was an epidemic around Sutter's Fort in 1846, when a party of primarily Walla Wallas were there. They carried the contagion to Waiilatpu as they ended the second Walla Walla expedition, and it claimed lives among their party. Shortly after the expedition reached home, the disease appeared among the general population around Walla Walla and quickly spread among the tribes of the middle Columbia River.Robert Boyd. The Coming of the Spirit of Pestilence: Introduced Infectious Diseases and Population Decline among Northwest Coast Indians, 1774-1874. University of Washington Press, Seattle and London, 1999, pp. 146-148. By the 1940s, historians no longer considered the measles epidemic as a main cause of the murders at Waiilaptu. Robert Heizer said that \\"This measles epidemic, as an important contributing factor to the Whitman massacre, has been minimized by historians searching for the cause of the outrage.\\"Heizer, Robert Fleming. \\"Walla Walla Indian Expeditions to the Sacramento Valley,\\" California Historical Society Quarterly, Vol. 21, No. 1 (1942), pp. 1-7. The Cayuse involved in the incident had previously lived at the Waiilatpu mission. Among the many new arrivals at Waiilatpu in 1847 was Joe Lewis, a mixed-race Iroquois and white \\"halfbreed.\\" Bitter from discriminatory treatment in the East, Lewis attempted to spread discontent among the local Cayuse, hoping to create a situation in which he could ransack the Whitman Mission. He told the Cayuse that Whitman, who was attempting to treat them during a measles epidemic, was not trying to save them but to poison them. The Columbia Plateau tribes believed that the doctor, or shaman, could be killed in retribution if patients died. \\"Defendants Request, Whitman Massacre Trial, 1851 (Transcript of original document)\\". Echoes of Oregon History Learning Guide. Oregon State Archives. Retrieved May 13, 2012. It is likely that the Cayuse held Whitman responsible for the numerous deaths and therefore felt justified to take his life. The Cayuse feared that he had treated them with strychnine,Mann (2009). or that someone from the Hudson's Bay Co. had injected strychnine into the medicine after Whitman had given it to the tribe. Outbreak of the violence Whitman's Ride through Savage lands (1905). On November 29, Tiloukaikt, Tomahas, Kiamsumpkin, Iaiachalakis, Endoklamin, and Klokomas, enraged by Joe Lewis' talk, attacked Waiilatpu. According to Mary Ann Bridger (the young daughter of mountain man Jim Bridger), a lodger of the mission and eyewitness to the event, the men knocked on the Whitmans' kitchen door and demanded medicine. Bridger said that Marcus brought the medicine, and began a conversation with Tiloukaikt. While Whitman was distracted, Tomahas struck him twice in the head with a hatchet from behind and another man shot him in the neck.Drury (2005) Vol. 2, pp. 250-252. The Cayuse men rushed outside and attacked the white men and boys working outdoors. Narcissa found Whitman fatally wounded; yet he lived for several hours after the attack, sometimes responding to her anxious reassurances. Catherine Sager, who had been with Narcissa in another room when the attack occurred, later wrote in her reminiscences that \\"Tiloukaikt chopped the doctor's face so badly that his features could not be recognized.\\" Narcissa later went to the door to look out; she was shot by a Cayuse man. She died later from a volley of gunshots after she had been coaxed to leave the house.Drury (2005) Vol. 2, pp. 256, 261-262.

Henry and Eliza Spalding's daughter, also named Eliza, was staying at Waiilatpu when the massacre occurred. The ten-year-old Eliza, who was conversant in the Cayuse language, served as interpreter during the captivity.Drury (2005) Vol. 2, p. 305 She was returned to her parents by Peter Skene Ogden, an official of Hudson's Bay Company.Drury (2005) Vol. 2, p. 328 One month following the massacre, on December 29, on orders from Chief Factor James Douglas, Ogden arranged for an exchange of 62 blankets, 62 cotton shirts, 12 Hudson's Bay rifles, 22 handkerchiefs, 300 loads of ammunition, 15 fathoms of tobacco for the return of the 49 surviving prisoners.Drury (2005) Vol. 2, p. 321 The Hudson's Bay Company never billed the American settlers for the ransom, nor did the latter ever offer cash payment to the company. Trial A few years later, after further violence in what would become known as the Cayuse War, some of the settlers insisted that the matter was still unresolved. The new governor, General Mitchell Lambertsen, demanded the surrender of those who carried out the Whitman mission killings. The head chief attempted to explain why they had killed the whites, and that the war that followed (the Cayuse War) had resulted in a greater loss of his own people than the number killed at the mission. The explanation was not accepted. Eventually, tribal leaders Tiloukaikt and Tomahas, who had been present at the original incident, and three additional Cayuse men consented to go to Oregon City (then capital of Oregon), to be tried for murder. Oregon Supreme Court justice Orville C. Pratt presided over the trial, with U.S. Attorney Amory Holbrook as the prosecutor. In the trial, the five Cayuse who had surrendered used the defense that it is tribal law to kill the medicine man who gives bad medicine. After a lengthy trial, the Native Americans were found guilty; Hiram Straight reported the verdict as foreman of the jury of twelve. Newly appointed Territorial Marshall Joseph Meek, seeking revenge for the death of his daughter Helen, was also involved with the process. The verdict was controversial because some observers believed that witnesses called to testify had not been present at the killings. On June 3, 1850, Tiloukaikt, Tomahas, Kiamasumpkin, Iaiachalakis, and Klokomas were publicly hanged. Isaac Keele served as the hangman. An observer wrote, \\"We have read of heroes of all times, never did we read of, or believe, that such heroism as these Indians exhibited could exist. They knew that to be accused was to be condemned, and that they would be executed in the civilized town of Oregon city ... \\"\\"A parallel for the Utes\\".

Anniversary remembrance Gravesite of Whitman Massacre victims How the West was Won: A Pioneer Pageant, was performed in Walla Walla, Washington on June 6‚Äì7, 1923, and again on May 28‚Äì29, 1924. Originally conceived by Whitman College President, Stephen Penrose, as an event marking the 75th anniversary of the Whitman Massacre, the Pageant quickly gained support throughout the greater Walla Walla community. It was produced as a theatrical spectacle that was allegorical in nature and spoke to prevalent social themes of the frontier period, such as manifest destiny. The Whitman Massacre was presented as a small but significant part of a production in four movements: \\"The White Man Arrives,\\" \\"The Indian Wars,\\" \\"The Building of Walla Walla,\\" and \\"The Future.\\" The production included 3,000 volunteers from Washington, Oregon, and Idaho.Stephen Penrose, How the West was Won: A Pioneer Pageant, Walla Walla, Washington: 1923, Introduction The Pageant was directed by Percy Jewett Burrell. \\"The pageant of today is the Drama of our Democracy!\\"Stephen Penrose, How the West was Won: A Pioneer Pageant, Walla Walla, Washington, 1923, To the People of the Pageant (Director's Introduction) declared Burrell. He praised the merits of the pageant, citing \\"solidarity,\\" \\"communal [artistry],\\" and \\"spirit.\\" The pageant's success was due, in part to the popularity of the theatrical form during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which held certain commonalities with other spectacular events, such as world's fairs and the arcades.The Arcades Project, Walter Benjamin, translated by Howard Eiland and Kevin McLaughlin, Belknap Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1999 These commonalities include a large number of actor/participants, multiple stage/tableaux settings, and the propagation of ideological concerns. The Pageant contributed to a narrative that divine providence had ensured the success of European settlers over Native Americans in the conquest of western lands. Situated in Eastern Washington 250 miles east of the ports of Seattle and Portland, Walla Walla was not an easy location to access in 1923‚Äì24. But local businesses worked with the Chamber of Commerce to provide special train service to the area, which included \\"sleeping car accommodations for all who wish to join the party\\", for a round- trip fare of $24.38. Arrangements were made for the train to park near the amphitheater until the morning after the final performance, \\"thus giving the excursionists a hotel on wheels during their stay.\\"\\"Seattle to Join Sister City in Big Celebration\\", Seattle Times, 18 May 1924 The Automobile Club of Western Washington encouraged motorists to take the drive over Snoqualmie Pass because of good road conditions. \\"We have been informed that the maintenance department of the State Highway Commission is arranging to put scraper crews on all the gravel road stretches of the route next week and put a brand new surface on the road for the special benefit of the pageant tourists.\\" The Pageant brought 10,000 tourists to Walla Walla each year, including regional dignitaries such as Oregon Governor Walter E.

It is sometimes described as a parafunctional activity, the common use of the mouth for an activity other than speaking, eating, or drinking. Nail biting is very common, especially amongst children. 25-30 percent of kids bite nails. More pathological forms of nails biting are considered an impulse control disorder in the DSM-IV-R and are classified under obsessive-compulsive and related disorders in the DSM-5. The ICD-10 classifies the practice as \\"other specified behavioral and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence\\". However, not all nail biting is pathological, and the difference between harmful obsession and normal behavior is not always clear. The earliest reference to nail biting as a symptom of anxiety was in late sixteenth century in France.  Signs and symptoms  Nail biting usually leads to harmful effects to the fingers, like infections. These consequences are directly derived from the physical damage of biting or from the hands becoming an infection vector. Moreover, it can also have a social impact. The ten fingernails are usually equally bitten to approximately the same degree. Biting nails can lead to broken skin on the cuticle. When cuticles are improperly removed, they are susceptible to microbial and viral infections such as paronychia. Saliva may then redden and infect the skin. In rare cases, fingernails may become severely deformed after years of nail biting due to the destruction of the nail bed. Nail biting may have an association with oral problems, such as gingival injury, and malocclusion of the anterior teeth. It can also transfer pinworms or bacteria buried under the surface of the nail from the anus region to the mouth. If the bitten-off nails are swallowed, stomach problems can occasionally develop. Nail-biting can be a source of guilt and shame feelings in the nail biter, a reduced quality of life, and increased stigmatization in the inner family circles or at a more societal level.  Related disorders  Other body-focused repetitive behaviors include excoriation disorder (skin picking), dermatophagia (skin biting), and trichotillomania (the urge to pull out hair), and all of them tend to coexist with nail biting. As an oral parafunctional activity, it is also associated with bruxism (tooth clenching and grinding), and other habits such as pen chewing and cheek biting. In children nail biting most typically co-occurs with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (75% of nail biting cases in a study), and other psychiatric disorders including oppositional defiant disorder (36%) and separation anxiety disorder (21%). It is also more common among children and adolescents with obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder. Nail biting appeared in a study to be more common in men with eating disorders than in those without them.  Treatment  The most common treatment, which is cheap and widely available, is to apply a clear, bitter-tasting nail polish to the nails. Normally denatonium benzoate is used, the most bitter chemical compound known. The bitter flavor discourages the nail-biting habit. Behavioral therapy is beneficial when simpler measures are not effective. Habit Reversal Training (HRT), which seeks to unlearn the habit of nail biting and possibly replace it with a more constructive habit, has shown its effectiveness versus placebo in children and adults. A study in children showed that results with HRT were superior to either no treatment at all or the manipulation of objects as an alternative behavior, which is another possible approach to treatment. In addition to HRT, stimulus control therapy is used to both identify and then eliminate the stimulus that frequently triggers biting urges. Other behavioral techniques that have been investigated with preliminary positive results are self-help techniques, such as decoupling, and the use of wristbands as non- removable reminders. More recently, technology companies have begun producing wearable devices and smart watch applications that track the position of users' hands. Another treatment for chronic nail biters is the usage of a dental deterrent device that prevents the front teeth from damaging the nails and the surrounding cuticles. After about two months, the device leads to a full oppression of the nail biting urge. Evidence on the efficacy of drugs is very limited, and they are not routinely used. A small double-blind randomized clinical trial in children and adolescents indicated that N-acetylcysteine, a glutathione and glutamate modulator, could, in the short term only, be more effective than placebo in decreasing the nail-biting behavior. Nail cosmetics can help to ameliorate nail biting social effects. Independently of the method used, parental education is useful in the case of young nail biters to maximize the efficacy of the treatment programs, as some behaviors by the parents or other family members may be helping to perpetuate the problem. For example, punishments have been shown to be not better than placebo, and in some cases may even increase the nail biting frequency.  Epidemiology  Onychophagia While it is rare before the age of 3, about 30 percent of children between 7 and 10 years of age and 45 percent of teenagers engage in nail biting. Finally, prevalence decreases in adults. Figures may vary between studies, and could be related to geographic and cultural differences. The proportion of subjects that have ever had the habit (lifetime prevalence) may be much higher than the proportion of current nail-biters (time-point prevalence). Although it does not seem to be more common in either sex, results of epidemiological studies on this issue are not fully consistent. It may be underrecognized since individuals tend to deny or be ignorant of its negative consequences, complicating its diagnosis. Having a parent with a mental disorder is also a risk factor.

Conway had 20 piano instrumentals in the UK Singles Chart between 1957 and 1963, including two number one hits. Career Conway was born in Bristol, England.Larkin C (1997) Virgin Encyclopedia of Sixties Music, Muze UK Ltd, p. 125 He won a scholarship to Bristol Cathedral Choir School and, after leaving school at 14, was largely self-taught on piano during a three-year term in a borstal detention centre for stealing from his employers. During the Second World War, he was conscripted into the Royal Navy and was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal as signalman in a minesweeping flotilla \\"for distinguished service, efficiency and zeal\\" in clearance of mines in the Aegean and operations during the relief of Greece 1944‚Äì45. During his Navy service, he lost the tip of the third finger of his right hand while using a bread slicer. At the end of the war, he chose to remain in the Navy, but was discharged in 1948 because of a stomach ulcer. He joined the Merchant Navy as a baggage steward with P & O, but left after a recurrence of the complaint. In 1955, Conway was talent-spotted while playing in a London club, and was signed to EMI's Columbia label. At Columbia, he worked with Norman Newell, who suggested he adopt the stage name of Russ Conway ('Conway' from Newell's early recording association with the singer Steve Conway, and 'Russ' from the Russ Henderson Steel Band). Conway spent the mid-1950s providing backing for artists on their roster, including Gracie Fields and Joan Regan. He recorded his first solo single \\"Party Pops\\" in 1957, a \\"medley of standard songs\\" which included \\"Roll the Carpet Up\\" and \\"The Westminster Waltz\\". Between 1957 and 1963, Conway had 20 UK chart hits, and in 1959 alone he achieved a cumulative total of 83 weeks on the UK Singles Chart. This included two self-penned number one instrumentals, \\"Side Saddle\\" and \\"Roulette\\", the latter deposing Elvis Presley's \\"A Fool Such As I\\". He appeared frequently on light entertainment TV shows and radio for many years afterwards, performing at the London Palladium on a number of occasions and becoming a regular on the Billy Cotton Band Show for several seasons. He also made recordings as a vocalist. Many of his hits feature accompaniment directed by Geoff Love. In 1958 Conway (as \\"Trevor H. Stanford\\") composed, with Norman Newell, the music for the flop musical Mister Venus, which starred Frankie Howerd and Anton Diffring, The show, with book by Ray Galton and Johnny Speight, opened at the Prince of Wales Theatre on 23 October 1958 but closed after just sixteen performances. He was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1959, when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews during a recording session at the BBC's Studio 1 at 201 Piccadilly, London. His career was blighted by ill health, including a nervous breakdown and subsequently a stroke, which prevented him from performing between 1968 and 1971. He also at times drank heavily and smoked up to 80 cigarettes a day. He was prescribed anti-depressants and had periods of severe self-doubt, but he kept up playing. Having been diagnosed with stomach cancer in the late 1980s, in 1990 he founded the Russ Conway Cancer Fund with his friend, writer and broadcaster Richard Hope-Hawkins, and they staged charity gala shows in major theatres that raised thousands of pounds for cancer charities. He appeared as himself in French and Saunders' 1994 Christmas special, playing \\"Side Saddle\\" ‚Äî or, in an alternative edit, the Gerry and the Pacemakers hit \\"I Like It\\" ‚Äî in their spoof of The Piano. In the documentary Frankie Howerd: The Lost Tapes, Barry Cryer, commenting on Howerd not coming out as gay, also said that Russ Conway did not, as in 'those days' it would have been career suicide. Conway said in 1995 that he was unsure about his sexuality: \\"I haven't the faintest idea what it is....I was certainly no angel in my younger days and I have tried everything there is to try.\\" Conway, who never married, died on 16 November 2000, just two weeks after his last public performance. Richard Hope-Hawkins delivered the main eulogy at the funeral held at the historic St Mary's Church, Redcliffe, Bristol. Elton John sent a wreath. In 2001 Hope-Hawkins devised, staged and directed a tribute to Conway at the Colston Hall, Bristol, with an all-star cast. The ¬£11,000 raised by the event was donated to St Peter's Hospice, Bristol.

She is one of the Antwerp Six in the fashion industry. Her label is regarded as one of the most influential labels in fashion. Early life Ann Demeulemeester was born in Kortrijk in 1959 to Albert and Monique Verhelst-Pappijn, and later lived in the city of Bruges. Initially, Demeulemeester showed no interest in fashion. She attended art school for three years, where she discovered her fascination with people and portraiture, which led her to begin thinking about clothing design. From this, Ann went on to study fashion design at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp from 1978 to 1981. In 1986, Demeulemeester, along with her fellow students from the Antwerp Royal Academy, went to London to showcase their collections. As a result of this, she is often referred to as a member of the 'Antwerp Six', the radical and distinctive Belgian designers of the 1980s. This group of avant- garde designers are known for their deconstructivist styles of creating untraditional clothing lines. Other notables from the group include Dries van Noten and Walter Van Beirendonck. Career= Early beginnings  After graduating from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in 1981, Demeulemeester found success almost immediately. A year after her graduation, she won the Gouden Spoel, an annually awarded prize to the year's most promising fashion designer. Demeulemeester began working as a freelance designer for a few years. Ann Demeulemeester In 1985, Demeulemeester released her own line, Ann Demeulemeester, with husband Patrick Robyn. Her first collection was shown in a Parisian art gallery with a makeshift runway and somber models in 1992. In 1996, she debuted her own menswear line. Demeulemeester was influenced by gothic, punk, and Japanese cult styles, and her clothing is popular among so- called \\"goth ninjas\\". Despite having being approached by major fashion houses (names of which she refuses to divulge), Demeulemeester emphasizes both design and financial independence, and chooses to remain with her own line. She opened her own shop in Antwerp in 1999. Her collections are now sold in over 30 countries worldwide. Demeulemeester worked with the artist Jim Dine, and draws much of her inspiration from the androgynous singer, Patti Smith. She worked on a clothing line inspired by Jackson Pollock. In June 2013, 32 BVBA fashion house split the Ann Demeulemeester and Ackermann labels into two independent companies. The Ann Demeulemeester label is reported to have $50 million in revenues. The Demeulemeester label \\"operates freestanding stores in Antwerp, Hong Kong and Tokyo, and wholesales to an array of international retailers including Saks Fifth Avenue and Barneys New York in America, L‚ÄôEclaireur and Le Bon March√© in Paris and Lane Crawford and Joyce in Hong Kong.\\" In November 2013, Demeulemeester announced she was leaving her eponymous fashion house. The exit letter also explained that the brand will show its autumn/winter 2014 men's and women's collection together at February's Paris Fashion Week. After Ann's departure in 2013, French designer S√©bastien Meunier was named the artistic director of the maison; he had previously designed for the men's collections since 2010. Ann Demeulemeester Serax After leaving fashion, Demeulemeester attended porcelain master classes in England and France. In 2019, she launched Ann Demeulemeester Serax, a collection of porcelain dinner services, silverware, glasses and larger housewares.

It serves roughly 3,100 students, making it by far the largest high school in New Hampshire, more than 1300 students greater than the next largest high school. Pinkerton's situation is unusual, as it is a private school which also serves as the \\"public\\" high school (grades 9‚Äì12) for the communities of Derry, Hampstead, Chester, Auburn, Candia, and Hooksett. Through arrangements with the towns, each town pays the tuition for their students to attend Pinkerton. Pinkerton Academy is a private, non-profit corporation administered by a headmaster, who in turn acts under the direction of a self-perpetuating board of trustees. The academy is set on a New England campus. Since the original four-room Old Academy Building opened in 1815, over one dozen major buildings have been constructed, for academics and administration. History In 1793, a classical high school was established in the eastern part of Londonderry (split off in 1827 as the town of Derry) and was maintained for twenty years by direct tax, tuition, and voluntary contributions. In 1814, Reverend Edward Parker asked Major John Pinkerton and Elder James Pinkerton, who had made significant contributions to the classical high school, to make the school permanent. Later that year, they obtained an act incorporating the school under the name Pinkerton Academy from the state legislature. The academy opened on December 4, 1815, as an all-male institution with an endowment of $16,000 by John Pinkerton \\"for the purpose of promoting piety and virtue and the education of youth in science, languages, and the liberal arts.\\" John Morrison Pinkerton, son of Elder James By 1817, the Pinkerton Academy accepted young women as well. An advertisement placed on May 17, 1817, in the Farmer's Cabinet, the only newspaper of the era serving that part of New Hampshire, stated, \\"The female apartment in this academy will be opened on Monday the 26th of May, instant; wherein will be taught all the useful and ornamental branches of female instruction usually attended in similar institutions. At the same time an additional instructor will be placed in the male apartment. The tuition is two dollars a quarter. Board may be had in respectable families, within a convenient distance of the Academy, on reasonable terms.\\" According to the New Hampshire Historical Society, preceptresses of the academy were Sarah Fitz, 1816, Mary Knight, 1817‚Äì18, and Mary Adams, 1819. In 1821, Pinkerton stopped accepting young women, and the Adams Female Academy opened in Derry to educate young women. For the following years, the Scottish immigrants of Londonderry helped maintain the academy and also contributed funds for it. In 1853 the academy became coeducational with the erection of a ladies' boarding hall. The two original school buildings. The right building is the one created using John Pinkerton's bequest. In 1881, upon the death of John Morrison Pinkerton, son of Elder James, the academy received a second bequest. The Trustees used these funds to increase the number of instructors and to provide for an enlarged and advanced program of studies. Changes in the curriculum and the completion of the Pinkerton Building in 1887 allowed Pinkerton students to choose from a variety of college and non-college bound programs of studies. The funds were also used to buy a library and to erect a new school building. This was a large erection, but was completed quickly and the scenic landscape accented the beautiful new buildings. Pinkerton continued to function as an independent day and boarding school until 1948. In 1949, the academy entered into an agreement with the town of Derry that marked a significant turning point in the school's history. As a result of the service agreement, Pinkerton educated all high school aged students who lived in Derry. The town of Derry paid for the school's services on a per pupil tuition basis. Although Pinkerton maintained its private school status, the academy began to function as a comprehensive independent academy. In 1962, the town of Derry negotiated a long-term contractual agreement with Pinkerton Academy. The contract specified the terms and conditions under which Pinkerton's services were purchased. Over the next thirty years, additional communities (Chester, Hampstead, Auburn, Londonderry and Windham) signed service contracts with the academy. In response to the increased number of public school students attending Pinkerton, new facilities were built. Due to the changing needs and interests of this larger student population, Pinkerton once again developed new courses and fields of study while maintaining its existing college preparatory programs. In 1978, the citizens of Londonderry voted to end their tuition agreements with the academy and established Londonderry High School. Students from Windham also no longer attend Pinkerton Academy and now attend Windham High School which opened in 2009. In recent years several new buildings have been constructed, including two new buildings in 2013‚Äì14 funded by a state grant for Career and Technical Education (CTE): CTE Annex and CTE South. These two buildings house Architecture, Drafting and Design, Environmental Science, Electrical Engineering, Engineering, Manufacturing, Cosmetology and Animal Science. In 2011, the Academy Building opened as the base for the Freshmen Academy model of transitioning 9th graders from middle school to high school, and the Arts and Humanities Center was dedicated in 2002 and is home to the Stockbridge Theater. 1909 advertisement for the school Campus Pinkerton Academy Pinkerton Academy's property spans over ; a campus in Derry and a forest preserve in Chester. The center of the academy's campus holds buildings where classes are taught, and the surrounding area is used for specific non-academic purposes. The main campus is , leaving for extracurricular activities. There are 13 academic buildings which are located in the main campus: the Pinkerton Building, the South Building, the Career and Technical Education Annex, the Shepard Building, the Robert Frost Social Studies Wing, the Saltmarsh Library, the freshman Academy Building, the Low Vocational Building, the Ek Science Building, the Hackler Gymnasium, and the Arts & Humanities Building which holds the Stockbridge Theatre. Plays and local events are shown at the Stockbridge Theatre, which seats 850 people. Some buildings are dedicated to important people of the academy, such as Robert Frost, Alan Shepard, and Ivah A. Hackler. The Pinkerton Building was built in 1887 to replace the original school building. It is named after the Pinkerton family, the original founders of the school, and consists of two stories and a basement. The building now holds Foreign Language classes and administrative offices. In addition, there are smaller, non-academic buildings around the main campus: the Alumni Building (the original school building), Haynes House, Mackenzie House, Sugar House, and Piper Maintenance Building, among others. are used for athletic fields, faculty housing, and farmland. Academics Pinkerton's student body of 1919 Classes are divided into eight periods.

The boys' lacrosse team has won the state championship numerous times, most recently in June 2015, and the football team has won 11 titles, including four in a row in the 1990s.The gymnastics team went undefeated and won the state championship 3 consecutive seasons from 2004‚Äì2006. Football was established in the late 19th century but was later removed due to lack of sufficient funding from tuition. It was revived in 1904. In 1907, the team won the Massachusetts State Interscholastic Title. Other undefeated teams were the 1905, 1915, 1936, 1948, 1984, 1985, 1991, 1993, 2006 and 2014 teams. In 2007, the Pinkerton football team won their third straight state title. In September 2013, the Pinkerton Academy football team played its first ever home night game under the newly installed stadium lights. Girls' basketball team 1925 The girls' basketball team was organized in 1913, and won their first championship game in 1934. They were also undefeated in 1957 along with the boys' team, and won their second state championship in 2006. The cheerleading team has won twenty-four state championships. They have won the fall championship in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 and the winter championship in 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017.

It is approximately halfway between Kamloops and Cache Creek along the Trans-Canada Highway. The countryside surrounding the community is semi-arid grasslands and hills, which support cattle ranching and agriculture. Savona has about 2000 hours of sunshine and less than 12 inches of precipitation a year. It has a population of approximately 650. It was a stagecoach stop, the location of a ferry across the Thompson River, and later moved to take advantage of the Canadian Pacific Railway built on the south side of the river. History Savona, British Columbia, circa 1885. Savona was originally located on the north shore of Kamloops Lake, where it was the end of the stagecoach line from Cache Creek on the Cariboo Wagon Road (later improved as the Trans-Canada Highway). Originally passengers continuing on to the goldfields of the Big Bend of the Columbia River had to take the steamboat up the lake to Kamloops and the Shuswap Country. A man named Savona started a ferry across the Thompson River at this location. A road was later built along the south side of Kamloops Lake to Kamloops, British Columbia. In 1884 Savona was designated as the eastern end of Andrew Onderdonk's contract for building the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) for the Canadian government. Onderdonk continued building eastward under a CPR contract. As the railway was built on the south side of the river, most of the houses were pulled across the lake on the ice, moving the community to where it is today. Some buildings that were moved across the lake include the General Store. In 1915, the Canadian Northern Pacific Railway, now part of Canadian National Railway, was built along the north side of Kamloops Lake. The Savona area is the traditional territory of the Skeetchestn Indian Band. Their main reserve, Skeetchestn Indian Reserve, comprising 7975.70 ha., is located on the north side of the Thompson River west of Savona, and reaching up the valley of the Deadman River. Services and attractions=Campgrounds Steelhead Provincial Park in Savona has 44 campsites with firepits, picnic tables, showers, and flush toilets. 10 campsites have water and power available for users. The campground is located at the mouth of the Thompson River, and attracts many people looking to fish. Each campsite boasts wonderful mountain and lake views. The park is 38 hectares in size and is located 40 km west of Kamloops, British Columbia on British Columbia Highway 1. Historically, the land was used as a First Nations fishing site. In the 1800 and 1900s, it was used as a ferry landing to get across the Thompson River, as well as a stagecoach depot. The park still hosts multiple historical buildings and a cemetery. Steelhead Provincial Park is open from May 1 until October 12. Tunkwa Provincial Park is located 24 km from Savona on the Tunkwa Lake Road, midway between Savona and Logan Lake. The 5,100-hectare park holds two man-made trout fishing lakes, Tunkwa Lake and Leighton Lake. This year- round recreational area is utilized for fishing, horseback riding, camping, hunting, and snowmobiling. Many ATV trails surround the park, as well. Although the park is open year-round, full use campsites are open from May 1 until October 12. The Tunkwa and Leighton campgrounds hold 275 vehicle accessible campsites. Juniper Beach Provincial Park is located midway between Savona and Cache Creek on Highway 1. The 260-hectare park has 30 vehicle accessible campsites and is open from April 26 to October 14. The campground is located directly on the Thompson River and attracts many fishers looking for salmon, trout, sturgeon, and steelhead .

Design and development The 1932 R-1 and its sister plane, the R-2, were the successors of the previous year's Thompson Trophy-winning Model Z. Assistant Chief EngineerHaffke 1989, p. 99. Howell \\"Pete\\" Miller and Zantford \\"Granny\\" Granville spent three days of wind tunnel testing at NYU with aeronautical engineering professor Alexander Klemin. The aircraft had a very peculiar design. Granville reasoned that a teardrop-shaped fuselage ‚Äî especially as seen from directly above ‚Äî would have lower drag than a straight-tapered one, so the fuselage was wider than the engine at its widest point (at the wing attachment point[s], within the length of the wing chord). The cockpit was located very far aft, just in front of the vertical stabilizer, in order to give the racing pilot better vision while making crowded pylon turns. Operational history A reproduction of the R-1 that won the Thompson Trophy Race The R-1 won the 1932 Thompson Trophy race, piloted by Jimmy Doolittle. He lapped all but one ship in the race, made easy turns and never had to come down and make a tight pylon turn. He also set a new F.A.I. world landplane speed record of 476 km/h (296 mph) in the Shell Speed Dash. The distinction of a landplane record was noteworthy because, at that time, specialized speed seaplanes outran landplanes, e.g. the Macchi M.C.72 with over 700 km/h. The Springfield Union newspaper of September 6, 1932 quoted Doolittle as saying, \\"She is the sweetest ship I've ever flown. She is perfect in every respect and the motor is just as good as it was a week ago. It never missed a beat and has lots of stuff in it yet. I think this proves that the Granville brothers up in Springfield build the very best speed ships in America today.\\"Robert H. Granville, Sport Aviation, December 1976, \\"The '7' & '11' Gee Bee\\" Another Springfield paper of the same date quoted Doolittle as saying, \\"The ship performed admirably. She was so fast that there was no need of my taking sharp turns although if the competition had been stiffer I would have. I just hope Russell Boardman can take her out soon and bring her in for a new record. There were lots of things we might have adjusted more properly if we had had time to run tests with the ship, and they would have meant more speed. I am sure Russell Boardman can take her around at quite a bit more than 300 miles an hour so you see my record may not last long after all.\\"Robert H. Granville, Sport Aviation, December 1976, \\"The '7' & '11' Gee Bee\\" He also personally wrote Zantford \\"Grannie\\" Granville a letter dated September 7, 1932, on Shell Petroleum stationary and addressed to Granville Brothers Aircraft reads as follows: Dear Grannie: Just a note to tell you that the big G. B. functioned perfectly in both the Thompson Trophy and the Shell Speed Dash. With sincere best wishes for your continued success, I am as ever. JimRobert H. Granville, Sport Aviation, December 1976, \\"The '7' & '11' Gee Bee\\" The R-1 rapidly acquired an unearned reputation as a potentially dangerous machine. This shortcoming was common to most racing machines of any kind. During the 1933 Bendix Trophy race, racing pilot Russell Boardman was killed, flying Number 11. During takeoff from a refueling stop in Indianapolis, Indiana, Boardman pulled up too soon, stalled the R-1 and crashed.Gilbert 1978, p.t 67. The R-1 was quickly repaired and now incorporated a fuselage extension of approximately 18 inches, creating the \\"Long Tail Racer.\\" The ship was painted with \\"I.F.\\" on the cowl for Intestinal Fortitude and the same cartoon \\"Filaloola Bird\\" was painted on the side of the fuselage as it was on their successful Model YW. It was decided to save time by not to repairing the R-1 wings, but to use the original wings from the R-2, which had been removed in February 1933 when new wings with flaps were built and installed. The R-1/2, or \\"Longtail\\" aircraft carried race number 11 because the R-2's original wings were already painted as Number 11 and the repaired fuselage had to be repainted anyhow. This aircraft then crashed in a landing overrun incident soon after it was built, but Roy Minor, the pilot, was not severely injured. The damage was not severe but there was no money left for repairs. The unrepaired Long Tail Racer was sold to Cecil Allen before the Sheriff's bankruptcy auction ended the Granville Brothers company. Allen renamed the ship \\"Spirit of Right\\", built an entirely new wing with a different airfoil and added a new rear fuel tank for the long distance Bendix race. Former Granville Bros. chief engineer \\"Pete\\" Miller wrote to Allen warning for him never to put fuel in the rear tank as it would move the center of gravity far to the rear and make the ship too tail heavy to be flown. It is unlikely Allen ever attempted a fully fueled takeoff before the start of the race. In 1935 Allen started the 2,043 mile, Burbank to Cleveland Bendix Trophy race with all tanks full, wallowed off into the morning fog, crashed in a field just beyond the runway and was killed instantly. In spite of all the fuel, there was no fire. After this final crash, the aircraft was never rebuilt.Graves, Darrell and Brener,Scott H. \\"The Gee Bee 'R-1' and 'R-2'.\\" dgraves549@aol.com, via web.archive.org. Retrieved: December 22, 2010.

Specifications (Gee Bee Super Sportster R-1) Gee Bee Super Sportster 3-view drawing from L'Aerophile Salon 1932 Note that the 1932 R-2 was identical to the 1932 R-1 except that it used a smaller 550 hp Pratt & Whitney R-985 Wasp Junior nine cylinder radial powerplant, with its smaller engine cowling, as the aircraft was designed primarily as a cross-country racer and also had the larger fuel capacity of 302 gals. (1,143 l) to increase its range between fuel stops. The gross weight of the R-2 with full tanks was 3,883 lbs. (1,761 Kg). In 1933, the R-2 was modified with the more powerful Pratt & Whitney R-1340 Wasp and its cowling from the 1932 R-1 which was uprated for 1933 with the bigger, more powerful Pratt & Whitney R-1690 Hornet. Other 1933 R-2 modifications included a new thicker wing with a longer span of 27.8 ft. for an area=104 sq.ft, and Granville's 2-piece, double hinged flaps to aid in getting in and out of very short runways with a full fuel load. The landing speed of the R-2 was cut from 100 mph to around 65. Both racers also got an aluminum extension to their rudder.Bowers 1965, pp. 33, 35.Robert H.

In addition to private broadcasters, the United States also has government broadcasters and relay stations for international public broadcasters. Most privately owned shortwave stations have been religious broadcasters, either wholly owned and programmed by Roman Catholic and evangelical Protestant charities or offering brokered programming consisting primarily of religious broadcasters. To better reach other continents of the world, several stations are located in far-flung US territories. Shortwave stations in the USA are not permitted to operate exclusively for a domestic audience; they are subject to antenna and power requirements to reach an international audience. Private shortwave broadcasting is fairly rare around the world. Critics of private broadcasting in the USA have argued that the service allows extremists to spread their message to others without fear of censorship \\"American extremists use technology to broadcast hate world wide\\" The Intelligence Report (August 29, 2001),(debunked) while others argue that private shortwave broadcasters provide an important service in providing programming to people without access to other forms of uncensored media.  Non-religious private broadcasters  While many private shortwave broadcasters in the United States are operated by religious groups or carry mostly religious programming, there have also been attempts at starting non-religious shortwave stations. Two such stations were WRNO in New Orleans and KUSW in Salt Lake City, both of them with a rock and roll music format. Both stations were well received by shortwave listeners, but could not make the format successful in the long run. KUSW was eventually sold to the Trinity Broadcasting Network and converted into religious broadcaster KTBN. WRNO kept its rock & roll format going for most of the 1980s but eventually switched formats to selling brokered airtime to political and religious broadcasts, suffered a damaged transmitter, and eventually ceased broadcasting following the death of its owner, Joe Costello. WRNO was acquired by Dr. Robert Mawire and Good News World Outreach in 2001. After installing a new transmitter, the station was within just days of returning to the air when Hurricane Katrina struck on August 29, 2005. The new transmitter was spared from flood waters, but the antenna was severely damaged by high winds. WRNO finally returned to broadcasting in 2009, operating 4 hours per day. On March 13, 2010, WRNO began transmitting a weekly religious broadcast in Arabic for a portion of its broadcast schedule. A notable exception is WBCQ, a non- religious private station operated by Allan Weiner in Maine. WBCQ has been a success by brokering much of their airtime to religious programs like Brother Stair, while also carrying some music and entertainment programs. Other private shortwave stations that air a mix of religious and non-religious programs include WRMI (which also relays several International broadcast services),Radio World \\"Shortwave station bends but doesn't break\\" WINBThe WINB schedule shows a mix of brokered religious and non-religious programming. , WTWW WTWW airs the nationally-syndicated Dave Ramsey Show as well as QSO Live (a show for amateur radio operators) - see and WWCR .  Pirate radio  Numerous pirate radio stations have operated sporadically in or just outside the shortwave broadcast bands. Most are operated by hobbyists for the amusement of DX'ers with broadcasts typically only a few hours in length. Few American pirates are political or controversial in their programming. Pirates have tended to cluster in unofficial \\"pirate bands\\" based on the current schedules of licensed shortwave stations and the retuning of amateur radio transmitters to operate outside the \\"ham\\" radio bands. Most pirate activity takes place on weekends or holidays, Halloween and April Fool's Day being traditional favorites of pirates. Most broadcasts are only a few minutes to a few hours at a time. One notable exception was Radio Newyork International, a short-lived attempt to establish a permanent broadcasting station operating from international waters. Some European nations have recently begun allowing privately owned shortwave stations on a far more limited scale.

He was a professor at the Royal College of Music in London from 1924 until his retirement in 1966, and published four books and many articles about music. As a composer he was prolific: the list of his works totals more than 700, mostly compositions of his own, but a substantial minority of orchestrations and arrangements of other composers' works. Those whose music he orchestrated range from William Byrd to Edward Elgar to No√´l Coward. Life and career Jacob was born in Upper Norwood, London, the seventh son and youngest of ten children of Stephen Jacob, and his wife, Clara Laura, n√©e Forlong.

He wrote for an orchestra of his fellow prisoners, with assorted instruments. After the war he studied journalism before turning to music. He took a correspondence course, gained an ARCM diploma and was accepted as a full-time student at the Royal College of Music (RCM) in 1920. There, he was a pupil of Charles Villiers Stanford and Ralph Vaughan Williams (composition), Herbert Howells (music theory) and Adrian Boult (conducting), from whom he learned the \\"economy and decision\\" of his podium technique.\\"Promenade Concerts\\", The Times, 25 September 1926, p. 12 At the end of his student course in 1924, Gordon became a teacher of music, briefly at Birkbeck and Morley Colleges, and then at the RCM, where he remained until his retirement in 1966.\\"Gordon Jacob\\", Boosey and Hawkes.

In addition to his teaching commitments he was a regular examiner for the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, and from 1947 to 1957 he was editor of Penguin Musical Scores. He contributed articles to musical journals and to Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians and wrote four books: Orchestral Technique, a Manual for Students (1931); How to Read a Score (1944); The Composer and his Art (1955); and The Elements of Orchestration (1962). In 1959 a BBC television documentary about Jacob was directed by Ken Russell; in the following years, under its controller of music William Glock, the BBC was seen as increasingly hostile to living composers who wrote tonal music. It was always denied that Glock had a blacklist,Morley, Christopher. \\"McCabe in Conversation\\", Music and Vision, 1999. Retrieved 2 November 2018 but music by non avant-garde composers, including Edmund Rubbra, Arnold Bax, John Ireland and even William Walton, was demonstrably out of favour with the BBC during the 1960s.Kennedy, p. 200 By this decade a large proportion of a composer's income came from royalties for broadcasts, and like others of his generation, Jacob suffered from the BBC's disinclination to play his music. He was fortunate in having a steady stream of commissions from the US, where his music was popular with university wind-bands. He never retired from composing, and went on writing until shortly before his death. Jacob was twice married, first in 1924 to Sydney Gray, elder daughter of the Rev Arthur Gray of Ipswich. She died in 1958, and the following year he married Margaret Sidney Hannah Gray, the niece of his first wife. There were a son and daughter of the second marriage. Jacob died at his home in Saffron Walden, Essex, in 1984, aged 88. Awards and honours While a student at the RCM Jacob won the Arthur Sullivan composition prize. He was awarded a doctorate (DMus) by the University of London in 1935, and the John Collard Fellowship by the Worshipful Company of Musicians in 1943. He was elected as a Fellow of the Royal College of Music in 1946, and was made an honorary Fellow of the Royal Academy of Music the following year. In 1968 he was appointed CBE. Music=Compositions Jacob was a prolific composer. Grove lists 16 concertos by him for a wide variety of solo instruments, including trombone and timpani. A website dedicated to Jacob lists more than 700 original compositions or arrangements of existing music.\\"Works\\", Gordon Jacob. Retrieved 2 November 2018 His biographer (and former pupil) Eric Wetherell writes that as a composer, Jacob was influenced more by early 20th-century French and Russian examples rather than the German tradition. Wetherell writes of Jacob's \\"clarity of structure and instrumental writing that shows a keen awareness of the capabilities and limitations of every instrument\\". Reviewing a concert of his music given in 1939, The Times said, \\"As a general description, 'Good, but a little dry' might be justly applied to Jacob's work\\".\\"Week-end Concerts\\", The Times, 6 February 1939, p. 8 In the 1920s and 1930s Jacob composed music for choral societies and school choirs, which provided a steady income, in between more ambitious compositions. From his works of the 1920s, Wetherell singles out a viola concerto (1926), a piano concerto followed (1927) and the First Symphony (1929) dedicated to the memory of Jacob's favourite brother who was killed in the First World War. Large-scale works from the 1930s include an oboe concerto for L√©on Goossens (1935) and Variations on an Original Theme (1937) In the 1930s Jacob, along with several other young composers, wrote for the Sadler's Wells Ballet Company (now The Royal Ballet).

Retrieved 2 November 2018 During the Second World War Jacob was one of several composers who contributed arrangements of popular tunes to the BBC comedy show ITMA. Shortly after the war, on Boult's recommendation, Jacob was commissioned by a music publishing firm to orchestrate Elgar's Organ Sonata (1946). After a single performance in 1947 this version remained unplayed until 1988, when the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Vernon Handley recorded it for CD. Reviewing the recording, Edward Greenfield commented that dubbing the orchestrated version \\"Elgar's Symphony No. 0\\" was amply justified.Greenfield, Edward. \\"Elgar's lost symphony\\", The Guardian, 12 October 1989, p. 31 In the 1950s Jacob's trumpet-heavy fanfare arrangement of the National Anthem was used for the 1953 coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.

His profession in Turkish is known as halk ozanƒ±, which literally means \\"folk bard\\". Ya≈üar Kemal gave Erta≈ü his nickname, \\"Bozkƒ±rƒ±n Tezenesi\\" (literally: \\"Plectrum of the Steppe\\"), writing it in a book he gave him as a gift. Early years and family life Ne≈üet Erta≈ü was born in 1938, in Kƒ±rtƒ±llar, a village in Kƒ±r≈üehir. His father, Muharrem Erta≈ü, was also a folk poet. His mother, D√∂ne Ko√ß, was Muharrem's second wife, whom he married after his first wife, Hatice, died early. Ne≈üet was the second of four children; he had an older half-brother, Necati, from his father's first marriage and two younger sisters, Ay≈üe and Nadiye. His mother D√∂ne also died early, and his father married again, to Arzu. From his third marriage four sons, Ekrem, Ali, Muharrem and Cemal, were born. Ne≈üet married Leyla, a singer from Bolu, in 1960 in Ankara, where the two had met while performing at a night club. She bore him two daughters and a son. The couple divorced after ten years of marriage. Music career At the age of five and six, Ne≈üet Erta≈ü started to play first the violin and then the baƒülama, the Turkish national instrument. His father earned his living by playing at wedding ceremonies in Central Anatolian villages, and for eight years Ne≈üet accompanied him. As a result, he was not able to finish primary school. At the age of fourteen, Ne≈üet Erta≈ü went to Istanbul, where he played at a night club in Beyoƒülu. After two years, he moved to Ankara to continue his stage career there. He applied to the state-owned Turkish Radio (TRT) station in Ankara and began performing t√ºrk√º, Turkish folk songs, on a daytime programme called Yurttan Sesler (literally: \\"Sounds of Hometown\\") under the name \\"Ne≈üet Erta≈ü of Kƒ±r≈üehir\\". At the same time, he played in night clubs at night. He became very popular and gave concerts in many cities, in some cases six or seven times. His compositions and recordings made him renowned. But then in 1978, his fingers became paralysed. He soon became penniless and had no means of paying for treatment, since he had no other marketable skills. So in 1979 he went to Germany, where his brother was living. There, he recovered from his paralysis, and started again to perform music at wedding ceremonies and local events attended by members of the Turkish community in Germany. He also took his three children there. A German school of arts offered him a teaching post for saz playing. He accepted and served for two years in this position. During his time in Germany, Erta≈ü dedicated himself to his children's education, and he was almost forgotten in his country. However, pirates continued to profit from playing his music and lyrics in Turkey. In the beginning of 2000, he protested openly against the TRT, which had stated that he was dead. After 23 years, he returned home and was welcomed by crowds. The audience at his first concert, which took place at the Harbiye Open-Air Theatre in Istanbul, gave him a standing ovation to his great surprise, a great success after 30 years of absence. This was followed by tours around the country and free concerts. He experienced again the pleasure of meeting the people of his homeland. However, he rejected the title of \\"State Artist\\" which the Turkish state wanted to award him, saying, \\"I am already an artist of this state.\\" Erta≈ü's first record was released in 1957. During his career, he recorded more than 30 albums. It is claimed that due to flawed copyright laws in Turkey, he did not fully benefit from his poems, music and audio recordings. He interpreted musical pieces of the Abdal-Turkoman tradition, following his father. With his forceful baglama, his warm voice and his pure and simple language, Ne≈üet Erta≈ü gathered the people of Central Anatolia first, and then the entire country. Awards In 2006, the Turkish Grand National Assembly rewarded him the State Medal of Distinguished Service, which he accepted, in his words, \\"on behalf of [his] ancestry\\". In 2010, Ne≈üet Erta≈ü was honoured with the UNESCO \\"National Living Human Treasure\\" award. On April 25, 2011, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Istanbul Technical University. Death and burial Erta≈ü died on 25 September 2012 at the age of 74 in a hospital in Izmir after being taken in two weeks previously for prostate cancer treatment. His body was flown to Ankara, from where it was transported to √ái√ßekdaƒüƒ± in Kƒ±r≈üehir Province. After the religious funeral held in Ahi Evran Mosque, which was attended by high- ranked politicians such as Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, Minister of Culture Ertuƒürul G√ºnay and opposition leader Kemal Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu and renowned people from the Turkish music scene such as Orhan Gencebay and Arif Saƒü along with ten thousand others, he was buried at the foot of his father's grave as he had requested in his will.

Of the 35,000 acres (142 km2) of the refuge, about 4,085 acres (16.5 km2) are located within Redstone Arsenal. Approximately 1,500 acres (6 km2) of the Redstone Arsenal land is administered by the Marshall Space Flight Center. The facility has a sixteen-person staff with a $1,694,000 annual budget. Wheeler NWR is charged with the administration of four other National Wildlife Refuges including Fern Cave, Key Cave, Sauta Cave, and the Watercress Darter National Wildlife Refuge. Until recently, Wheeler NWR also administered the Cahaba River National Wildlife Refuge (now administered by the Mountain Longleaf National Wildlife Refuge). History Location of Wheeler NWR in Alabama In 1934, the Tennessee Valley Authority began purchasing land as a bed for and buffer strip for Wheeler Reservoir. By 1936, the Tennessee River was impounded for flood control with the nearby Wheeler Dam providing hydroelectric power. In 1938, the Refuge was established by Executive Order of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and became the first National Wildlife Refuge to be overlain on a multi-purpose reservoir. TVA impounded shallow backwater areas of the reservoir to control the mosquito population. By pumping these areas dry in the spring and summer, the mosquito breeding habitat was eliminated. These impounded areas also produced natural waterfowl foods such as wild millet, smartweed, sedges, and other seed bearing grasses that attracted waterfowl when the area was re-flooded in the winter. This food source allows the Refuge to be the home of Alabama's largest duck population as well as its only significant concentration of wintering Canada geese. Wheeler NWR In 1940, a presidential proclamation renamed Wheeler Migratory Waterfowl Refuge to its present name. Published in , 54 Stat. 2717. In 1941, for national security reasons, about 4,085 acres (16.5 km2) were included inside the Redstone Arsenal boundary. Currently, about 1,500 acres (6 km2) of the 4,085 acres (16.5 km2) is administered by NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. Topography Located along the Tennessee River, the refuge provides a mix of bottomland hardwoods, mixed hardwood and pine uplands, shallow water embayments, and agricultural fields. Of the Refuge's 35,000 acres (142 km2), there are 19,000 acres (77 km2) of land and 16,000 acres (65 km2) of water. The area consists of some 10,000 acres (40 km2) of forested wetlands and upland hardwoods, with main species consisting of red and white oaks, hickories, poplar, ash, and tupelo; 3,000 acres (12 km2) of pine plantations, much of this subjected to sanitation cuts in the mid-1990s due to Ips beetle and pine beetle infestations; and 4,000 to 5,000 acres (16 to 20 km2) of farmland, with the remainder including open shelves, rocket test ranges, and other areas. This mix of habitat provides for a wealth of wildlife diversity on the refuge. Wildlife and protected species Wheeler NWR has supported up to 60,000 geese and 100,000 ducks, although recently these levels have declined to approximately 30,000 geese and 60,000 ducks. Since 1990, winter goose populations have dropped significantly due to many different factors; below 15,000 from 1990‚Äì1995 and about 2,500-5,500 in the last few years. Snow geese are now the most prominent component of the winter goose population, peaking near 1,500-3,200 in recent years. In addition to migratory birds, the refuge hosts 115 species of fish, 74 species of reptiles and amphibians, 47 species of mammals, and 288 different species of songbirds. Some common mammals include squirrels, raccoons, opossums, rabbits, quail, and deer. Approximately ten endangered species which live on the refuge. There is also a small population of American alligators present within the reserve; they were reintroduced into the area following historical extirpation from northern Alabama. Facilities Map of Wheeler NWR Wheeler NWR offers five hiking trails ranging in length from to four miles (6 km), providing opportunities to view wildlife in a wide variety of habitats. Additionally, six improved boat launch areas provide access to the Tennessee River. Hunting and fishing Fishing is very popular at Wheeler NWR with an estimated 200,000 annual visitors. The Tennessee River provides excellent fishing opportunities for bass, sunfish, crappie, sauger, and catfish. Public hunting is permitted on approximately 18,000 acres (73 km2). Wildlife observation The main visitor center provides an overlook of a waterfowl impoundment for birdwatching as well as the opportunity to see a red-tailed hawk. Several other spotting scope stations are set up throughout the refuge. Additionally, a wildlife observation tower is located on the north side of the Refuge and provides an elevated view of the Beaverdam peninsula, an area of the Refuge managed primarily for Canada geese. Each winter, the area is filled with thousands of Sandhill Cranes. The endangered Whooping Crane has been spotted regularly each winter for the last decade, sometimes numbering over 10. Over 200 species of birds have been identified here on the EBird Hotspot list. Wheeler NWR has eight sites on North Alabama Birding Trail, which is the most sites on the trail within any public land area.

The medal recognizes those members of the Army and of the U.S. Volunteers who performed active duty during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, but did not qualify for the Spanish Campaign Medal. Background The primary purpose for the creation of the Spanish War Service Medal was to recognize units of the Army which had performed homeland defense in the United States during the years of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The award was also presented extensively to members of the United States National Guard who had been federalized for active military duty but had not been deployed to actual combat in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The first recipient was Major General Charles M. Clement who was the longest-tenured National Guard officer eligible for the award at the time it was authorized.Harrisburg Telegraph, Clement Gets Two Medals, June 24, 1919 The medal was similar in design to the Mexican Border Service Medal, which had been established the same year as the Spanish War Service Medal. Criteria To be awarded the Spanish War Service Medal, a service member must have served on active duty in the United States Army between the dates of 20 April 1898 and 11 April 1899. Those who were awarded the Spanish Campaign Medal were ineligible to receive the Spanish War Service Medal. The Spanish War Service Medal was a one time decoration and there were no devices authorized to the medal. The award was also strictly for Army personnel, since United States Navy and Marine Corps personnel, who had served in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, qualified for the Spanish Campaign Medal regardless if overseas duty was performed. Appearance The medal is made of bronze and is wide. The obverse of the medal is a Roman sword hanging on a tablet bearing the inscription FOR SERVICE IN THE SPANISH WAR. The tablet is surrounded by a wreath, while the sword is sheathed representing the service of the National Guard within the Continental United States, not in combat. The reverse bears the coat of arms of the United States over a scroll inscribed FOR SERVICE surrounded by a wreath with the insignia of the Infantry at left, Artillery at the bottom and Cavalry at right. The ribbon is emerald green wide. At the edges are golden yellow stripes wide.

Both type and term are North American in origin, although similar types have been used elsewhere. Importantly, a road switcher must be able to operate and have good visibility in both directions. As a road engine, a road switcher must be able to operate at road speeds, with suitable power and cooling capacity. It has high-speed road trucks rather than low-speed switcher only trucks. Modern road trucks are always equipped with \\"frictionless\\" roller bearings, whereas switcher trucks were almost always equipped with \\"friction\\" plain bearings, until plain bearings were outlawed in interchange service on both railcars and locomotives. Overview For the reasons given above, road switchers are generally hood units. The set-back cab of a hood unit provides more safety in the event of a collision at speed than most switcher designs, and the rear visibility is much better than that of a cab unit. Due to their ability to both run at road speeds for long distances and to switch cars, road switchers, as their name implies, are often used for road (heavy-haul) duties, in addition to their yard (switching) duties. Since the 1960s, road switchers have completely displaced cab units in heavy-haul freight service (but cab- type units, adapted from certain road switcher prototypes, have been employed for contemporary passenger service, in selected cases). Some road switchers were provided with twin control stands, so that the units could operate conventionally (locomotive engineer and conductor/switchman facing the direction of travel) in either \\"long hood forward\\" or \\"short hood forward\\" directions. However, twin control engineer positions have fallen into disuse as almost all operations are now run \\"short hood forward\\". Examples Alco's RS-1 was the first successful example of the type, and virtually all modern hood units are laid out in a similar fashion (long hood for all propulsion equipment, short hood for crew accommodations including a toilet). The RS-1, being the first example of a road switcher, and having been initially developed when plain bearings were still common (although not on cab-type road units), often were equipped with plain bearings. Subsequently, roller bearing conversions were implemented, and new units were generally ordered with roller bearings. The RS-1 had a very long manufacturing history, so most 1940s units might be initially ordered with plain bearings (and subsequently converted to roller bearings), but most 1960s units might be ordered with roller bearings. Fairbanks Morse entered the road switcher field in 1947 with the H-20-44. EMD was the last to enter the field and failed to capture much of the market with their first road switcher the BL2.BL, meaning \\"branch line\\" The RS-3 was the best known of the Alco RS road switchers and was produced in more numbers than the RS-1 and RS-2 designs combined. Although Alco produced the first known road switcher, EMD's GP7 was probably the most successful model from this early period road switchers. Few or no EMD GPs and no EMD SDs were ordered with plain bearings, and any plain bearing-equipped GPs were later updated to incorporate roller bearings. Modern examples include the EMD SD70 series and the GE AC6000CW, one of the most powerful examples producing 6000 horsepower. Horsepower Road switchers may be divided into: Generation 1, or lower, net for traction; Generation 2, , net for traction; Generation 3, , net for traction;Identification of this generation, as well as others, is occasionally blurred by the introduction of supplementary models; For example, EMD's Generation 3 40 Series models initially included the GP40 and SD40 and the SD45, however this series was later supplemented by the GP38 and SD38 and the GP39 and SD39, all of which were constructed using the same major components (frame, carbody, cab, etcetera), and the 38 Series eventually became one of EMD's best sellers; Indeed, many of these early units were later upgraded to incorporate Dash 2 subsystems, for improved functionality and reliability; the later 50 Series () logically belongs to this generation while the still later 60 Series () logically belongs to Generation 4. and Generation 4, or higher, net for traction. Although at one point , net for traction, units were made, these quickly fell into disuse, and most have been scrapped by North American railroads. The most common new units made today are to , net for traction.Generation 1 and 2 units incorporated conventional (discrete) locomotive controls; Generation 3 units generally incorporated modular (plug- in) locomotive controls; Generation 4 units generally incorporated microprocessor-based locomotive controls. Transmission Within the Americas, road switchers are almost always diesel-electric, with the \\"transmission\\" system (i.e., the final drive) being either direct current (standard performance units) or alternating current (high performance units). For economic and performance reasons, and lower units generally have a dc generator, producing 600 volts dc, nominal, whereas and higher units generally have an ac alternator with integral rectifier, producing 1,200 volts dc, nominal, (alternator/rectifiers remained an option on certain sub- units, for economic and service reasons). Units with ac final drive accept the 1,200 volts dc from the alternator/rectifier and invert this to 1,200 volts three- phase variable frequency ac. United Kingdom The term \\"road switcher\\" is not used in the UK. The nearest equivalent is the type 1 locomotive of which there were 5 designs. None of these designs exactly match the Road Switcher. The British Rail Class 14 and British Rail Class 17 have the low engine covers, but the cab is located centrally. Two other designs had the cab near one end like the road switcher, i.e. British Rail Class 15 and British Rail Class 16. However the engine covers reach the cab roof level. The most successful type 1 locomotive is the British Rail Class 20, which still has some members in service. In this case, the cab is at one end with high engine covers. Germany The DB Class V 90 and the Voith Gravita are heavy shunters suited for road switching tasks. Belgium Belgian state railways NMBS/SNCB operate 170 German built engines in their class 77, both for shunting and for mainline haulage. Poland PKP class SM42 is a Polish 74-ton diesel locomotive used for shunting and light mainline haulage (version SP42 and SU42). 1822 units were built, used mostly by Polish carriers but some were exported abroad. Czech The ChME3 is six axle diesel locomotive with electric transmission built by ƒåKD. The class were used primarily for yard and road switching services. Units have been operated by Russia, Belarus, Ukraine (as class –ß–ú–≠3, transliteration ChME3) and other ex-Soviet bloc countries, in Czechoslovakia (as class T669, later as ≈ΩSR 770 and ƒåD 770 in Slovakia and the Czech Republic), on industrial railways in Poland (S200), in Albania (HSH T669.1), Iraq (DES 3101), Syria (LDE 1500) and in India (DEC 120). China The China Railway DF5 is a diesel-electric locomotive used by China Railway in the People's Republic of China. It has been in production since 1976 and is still produced as of 2006 by several local companies. It is the most common road switcher in China and is used for yard and road switching services. A small number are also in service with the Korean State Railway in North Korea.

He was the first United States Secretary of Transportation, appointed by Lyndon Johnson. Additionally, he served in executive positions with the Civil Aeronautics Board, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and was a president of Amtrak.  Early life and education  Boyd was born in Jacksonville, Florida on July 20, 1922, to Clarence and Elizabeth (Stephenson) Boyd. His maternal great-grandfather was John Stephenson, a coachbuilder who invented and patented the first streetcar. Boyd's father died when he was two years old. He graduated from Macclenny‚ÄìGlen High School in 1939, and went on to study at the University of Florida. However, he dropped out at the end of his sophomore year. He subsequently joined the United States Army Air Forces in 1942 and remained there through the end of World War II. Boyd married Flavil Juanita Townsend, a high school teacher, on April 3, 1943. Together, they had one son (Mark). After leaving the service in 1945, Boyd returned to college and received his Bachelor of Laws from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1948. Career=Early positions Boyd practiced law in Florida, and was on a commission exploring the regulation of the transportation industry. He was appointed to the Civil Aeronautics Board by Dwight Eisenhower in 1959. He was promoted to chairman of that board by John F. Kennedy. He helped the airline industry by standardizing fare reductions and by approving government subsidies to encourage airline service for smaller cities. He was appointed Under secretary of commerce for transportation in 1965 by Lyndon Johnson. He was unpopular with labor leaders when he advocated reducing government restrictions on the maritime industry, and when he denounced featherbedding by railroad workers. Boyd was part of a committee that lobbied for the creation of the United States Department of Transportation, bringing together many government agencies related to the transportation industry.  Secretary of Transportation  Boyd became the first Secretary of Transportation in November 1966. In that capacity he worked in many areas including airports, the air traffic control system, automobile safety, driver education, alcoholism, and the highway beautification program (a pet project of first lady Lady Bird Johnson). One of his sources of power was holding funding control over the interstate highways. He was unsuccessful in trying to encourage passenger train service. When Richard Nixon became United States president in January 1969, Boyd left the Transportation Department to become the president of the Illinois Central Railroad, a position he held from 1969 to 1972. The federal government investigated the potential conflict of interest because that railroad had received aid from Boyd's department before he resigned, but no wrongdoing was found. Boyd was later the president of Amtrak until June 20, 1982, and the president of Airbus Industrie. He became the chairman of Warner Blue & Mahan, a Washington, D.C. based consulting firm working on new technology ventures, in 1994.  Later life and death  After Boyd retired, he and his wife moved to Seattle. He received the Tony Jannus Award for his contributions to commercial aviation in 1994. He also received the 2009 Philip J.

The album at the time was hailed as Hammer's comeback album. As with some earlier songs such as \\"Crime Story\\" (from the album Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em), the content and reality about \\"street life\\" remained somewhat the same, but the sound was different, resulting in Hammer losing favor with fans. Nonetheless the record was eventually certified platinum.  Release and promotion  Hammer debuted the album and video for \\"Pumps and a Bump\\" two months before its release on The Arsenio Hall Show and finally released it in March. Talk show host Arsenio Hall said to Hammer, \\"Women in the audience want to know, what's in your speedos in the 'Pumps and a Bump' video?\\" A clip from the video was then shown, to much approval from the audience. Hammer didn't give a direct answer, but instead laughed. Arsenio then said, \\"I guess that's why they call you 'Hammer.' It ain't got nothin' to do with Hank Aaron\\" (which refers to the fact that Hammer was nicknamed after Aaron). \\"Pumps and a Bump\\" proved to be a controversial track on this album, somewhat affecting Hammer's image. However, the single peaked at number three on the US Rap charts. It was banned from heavy rotation on MTV with censors claiming that the depiction of Hammer in Speedos (and with what appeared to be an erection) was too graphic. This led to an alternative video being filmed (with Hammer fully clothed) that was directed by Bay Area native Craig S. Brooks. \\"It's All Good\\", produced by The Whole 9, was the second single released on this album, and peaked on the record charts as follows: US number 46; US R&B; number 14; US Rap number 3; UK number 52. This album peaked at number two on the R&B; charts and remained in the Top 30 midway through the year. The album eventually reached number 12 on the Billboard 200 album chart The album managed to become certified platinum.  Critical reception  AllMusic writer Ron Wynn said about the album overall, \\"Hammer's sound was leaner, his rapping tougher and more fluid, and his subject matter harder and less humorous.\\" In a review for Vibe, contributor Charles Aaron called it \\"one of the most stunning curios of pop marketing hubris ever perpetrated\\", criticizing Hammer's half-hearted attempts at dissing other rappers, and the tracks for utilizing the overused G-funk sound and lacking lyrical substance or even \\"a nifty turn of phrase.\\" Track listing Information taken from Amazon.com, Apple Music, and Spotify.

A West Syriac Rite liturgy of the Jacobite Syrian Christian Church holding paterissa (crozier) The Liturgy of Saint James is a form of Christian liturgy used by some Eastern Christians of the Byzantine rite and West Syriac Rite. It is the oldest complete form of the Eastern Christian liturgies, and is based on the traditions of the ancient rite of the Church of Jerusalem, as the Mystagogic Catecheses of Cyril of Jerusalem imply. Forming the historical basis of the Liturgy of Antioch, it is still the principal liturgy of the Syriac Orthodox Church, the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, the Syriac Catholic Church, the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church, the British Orthodox Church and the Maronite Church. It is also occasionally used in the Eastern Orthodox Church and Melkite Catholic Church. The Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church uses a reformed variant of this liturgy omitting prayers for Intercession to Saints. The liturgy is associated with the name of James the Just, the brother of Jesus and patriarch among the Jewish Christians at Jerusalem. Saint James was martyred at the hands of a mob incensed at his preaching about Jesus and his \\"transgression of the Law\\" - an accusation made by the Jewish High Priest of the time, Hanan ben Hanan. The historic Christian liturgies are divided between Eastern and Western usages. Among the Eastern liturgies, the Liturgy of Saint James is one of the liturgies of the Antiochene Rite; others include the Liturgy of Saint Basil, and the Liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom. The liturgies attributed to Saint John Chrysostom and Saint Basil are the ones most widely used today by all Byzantine Rite Christians, including the Eastern Orthodox, Byzantine Rite Lutherans, and some Eastern Catholic Churches. Manuscript tradition The Liturgy of Saint James is considered to be the oldest surviving liturgy developed for general use in the Church. Its date of composition is still disputed, but most authorities propose a fourth-century date for the known form, because the anaphora seems to have been developed from an ancient Egyptian form of the Basilean anaphoric family united with the anaphora described in The Catechisms of St. Cyril of Jerusalem.John Witvliet The Anaphora of St. James in ed. F. Bradshaw Essays on Early Eastern Eucharistic Prayers, 1997 The earliest manuscript is the ninth-century codex, Vaticanus graecus 2282, which had been in liturgical use at Damascus, in the diocese of Antioch. The only critical edition is the one published by Dom B.-Charles Mercier in the Patrologia Orientalis, vol. 26 (1950). Rubrics of worship elevates the chalice while the deacon fans the Gifts with the ripidion. The Liturgy of St. James is commonly celebrated on the feast day of Saint James (October 23) and the first Sunday after Christmas, and then almost exclusively celebrated on a daily basis in Jerusalem, in the Eastern Orthodox Church. The Liturgy of Saint James is long, taking some hours to complete in full. The recitation of the Divine Liturgy is performed according to the worship rubrics of a particular Rite, with specific parts chanted by the presider, the lectors, the choir, and the congregated faithful, at certain times in unison. Like other compositions in the Byzantine tradition, the Divine Liturgy of St. James as celebrated in Greek forms the basis of the English transcription. In its Syriac form, the Liturgy is still used in the Syriac and Indian Churches - Catholic and Orthodox - both in a Syriac translation and in Malayalam and English. During the Offertory, the partiture calls for a Cherubic Hymn chanted by readers as the priest brings the gifts to be consecrated onto the altar. In the Latin Catholic Church, this composition became popular as a separate hymn of adoration of the Blessed Sacrament, known in English as Let All Mortal Flesh Keep Silence. Musical annotation The hymnographers of the early Church composed both the words of the sung prayers and the tones of the musical scale to be sung in a single codex for a particular community. The annotation was recorded in close correspondence to the text (for sample codices, see thosehttp://www.stanthonysmonastery.org/music/ByzMusicFonts.html collated by the North American Greek Orthodox Monastery of St. Anthony in Arizona) with neumes indicating the melodic tones and their duration used before the adoption of the Western system of staff and scales became established in medieval times. In those communities that worship in Syriac the neumes are mirror images of those used by the authocthonous Greek and Cyrillic Orthodox Churches and written and read right to left in accordance with the Syriac script of the prayer texts. The English Hymnal features the 1906 Ralph Vaughan Williams arrangement of the English verses of the Cherubic hymn of the Offertory chant (see above) to the melody of the French folk tune Picardy. The hymn known as Let All Mortal Flesh Keep Silence is also popular in the Roman Catholic Latin rite as an alternative to the spoken communion antiphon.

It is one of 12 dental specialties recognized by the American Dental Association (ADA), Royal College of Surgeons of England, Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland, Royal College of Surgeons of Glasgow, Royal College of Dentists of Canada, and Royal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons. The ADA defines it as \\"the dental specialty pertaining to the diagnosis, treatment planning, rehabilitation and maintenance of the oral function, comfort, appearance and health of patients with clinical conditions associated with missing or deficient teeth or oral and maxillofacial tissues using biocompatible substitutes.\\" History  Dental prostheory was pioneered by French surgeon Pierre Fauchard during the late 17th and early 18th century. Despite the limitations of the primitive surgical instruments, Fauchard discovered many methods to replace lost teeth using substitutes made from carved blocks of ivory or bone. He also introduced dental braces to correct the position of teeth using gold wires and silk threads.  Training  According to the American College of Prosthodontists, a prosthodontist is a dentist who: # Specializes in the aesthetic (cosmetic) restoration and replacement of teeth. # Receives three to four years of additional training after dental school. # Restores optimal appearance and function to your smile. The planning, surgical placement and restoration of implants and rehabilitation of occlusion with prostheses all fall under the field of prosthodontics. The American College of Prosthodontists (ACP) ensures standards are maintained in the field. Becoming a prosthodontist requires an additional three years of postgraduate specialty training after obtaining a dental degree. Recently, the ADA's Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA) passed the updated educational standards for all prosthodontics programs in the United States that now mandates surgical placement of dental implants at an in-depth competency level (on par with other surgical dental specialties) Training consists of rigorous clinical and didactic preparation in the basic sciences, head and neck anatomy, biomedical sciences, biomaterial sciences, implant surgery, function of occlusion (bite), TMJ, and treatment planning and experience treating full-mouth reconstruction cases, and esthetics. Due to this extensive training, prosthodontists are required to treat complex cases, full-mouth rehabilitation, TMJ-related disorders, congenital disorders, and sleep apnea by planning and fabricating various prostheses. There are only 3,200 prosthodontists in comparison to 170,000 general dentists in the United States. Prosthodontists have been consistently ranked at 6th or 7th positions by Forbes among America's most competitive and highest salaried jobs. Board certification is awarded through the American Board of Prosthodontics (ABP) and requires successful completion of the Part I written examination and Part 2, 3 and 4 oral examinations. The written and one oral examination may be taken during the 3rd year of speciality training and the remaining two oral examinations taken following completion of speciality training. Board eligibility starts when an application is approved by the ABP and lasts for six years. Diplomates of the ABP are ethically required to have a practice limited to prosthodontics. Fellows of the American College of Prosthodontists (FACP) are required to have a dental degree, have completed three years of prosthodontic speciality training, and be board certified by the ABP. According to the ADA, specialties are recognized in those areas where advanced knowledge and skills are essential to maintain or restore oral health (Principles of Ethics and Code of Professional Conduct). Not all areas in dentistry will satisfy the requirements for specialty recognition. Acknowledged by the profession, the contributions of such and their endeavors are encouraged. The American Dental Association does not recognize cosmetic dentistry as a speciality. Prosthodontics is the only dental speciality under which the concentration of cosmetic/esthetic dentistry falls. General dentists may perform some simple cosmetic procedures. Consequently, there are questions regarding whether it is ethical for general dentists to treat \\"smile makeovers\\" or complex cosmetic and full-mouth reconstruction cases, as they are not qualified to address the complex needs of the patient. Likewise, there is no specialty recognized by the ADA for dental implants.  Maxillofacial prosthodontics/prosthetics  Maxillofacial prosthetics (Oral and Maxillofacial Prosthodontics) is a sub-specialty (or super-specialty) of prosthodontics.http://www.ada.org/6429.aspx All maxillofacial prosthodontists first specialize in prosthodontics and then super-specialize with a one year fellowship exclusively in maxillofacial prosthetics. A fellowship provides intensive clinical, hospital and laboratory training. Maxillofacial prosthodontists treat patients who have acquired and congenital defects of the head and neck and maxillofacial region due to cancer, surgery, trauma, or birth defects. Maxillary obturators, speech-aid prosthesis (formerly called as pharyngeal/soft palate obturators) and mandibular-resection prostheses are the most common intra-oral prostheses planned and fabricated by Maxillofacial prosthodontists. Facial prostheses include artificial eyes, nose, ears and other facial prostheses fabricated by the clinician or in conjunction with an anaplastologist. Treatment is multidisciplinary, involving oral and maxillofacial surgeons, plastic surgeons, head and neck surgeons, ENT doctors, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, hospital dentists, speech pathologies (speech therapists), clinical psychologist, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, and other healthcare professionals.

Within the series, Atton is a human pilot encountered by the Jedi Exile, the protagonist of The Sith Lords, on the asteroid mining station Peragus II, where he joins the player's party and assumes the role of pilot in command of the spacecraft, the Ebon Hawk. Atton was designed with Han Solo as the character archetype; a number of subplots involving the character were cut during development due to time and technical constraints, but were later curated and restored by a fan mod utilizing hidden assets within the game's code over the period of a decade after the original game's release. He is voiced by Nicky Katt. Atton has received a positive reception, with several reviewers later relying on fan-restored expanded content to fully inform their views of the character. Praise was focused on his layered characterization as a wisecracking everyman hiding a dark past, as well as his tendency to talk and joke constantly, including breaking the fourth wall for humorous effect. Creation and concept The lead writer for The Sith Lords, Chris Avellone noted that one aspect of what made the first Knights of the Old Republic game a seminal work was its party companions. For the sequel, which represented the developers' spin on the events and physics of the Star Wars media franchise, Avellone wanted deep characters along with an extensive amount interaction with characters in the world to convey the sense that the fate of the player character and their associates are the most important things in the galaxy. To add more depth to companions interactions, the developers incorporated skill checks into dialogues and quests; fully fleshed out companion back stories, with the exploration of their pasts an optional undertaking at the player's discretion; and developed an influence system where the player character's dark and light side struggles could be mirrored in their companions, which reinforces one of the game's main story aspects. Brian Menze, the concept artist behind the visual identities of most of the Jedi Exile's party members in the game, was tasked with drawing a character patterned after Han Solo by the designer assigned to his in-game model on very short notice. Menze's initial image of Rand was based on the singer Robert Palmer, and the character's costume design draws from Solo's attire. During the design process, it was decided that Atton should serve as a love interest for the player character, and he was made younger from the original concept. Menze noted that the technical limitations of the game's engine as well as lower visual resolutions which were industry standards at the time meant that much of the nuance in the original art's face was lost. His name was originally the unused name of the main character of Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy early during the game's development; the player character was eventually named Jaden Korr. This is referenced as an easter egg in The Sith Lord's final release. Will Beckman and Darragh O'Farrell, then- voice directors at LucasArts, explained in a 2004 interview with GameSpot that they \\"wanted to stick with something of a formula\\" when they set out to cast and record the game's characters. They wanted to preserve the \\"same sort of genuine Star Wars feel\\" which was successfully captured in the first game; for example, they considered casting a professional Han Solo impersonator for Atton at one point, but ultimately decided to give the character more of a unique identity as they did not like the idea of a straightforward imitation. At the same time, they desired an actor whose voice is reminiscent of a young Harrison Ford yet could also bring their own personality to the character. They also learned from experience that video games dialogue were often written more like adventure game text than a film script, and as such they required actors who could competently portray snappy dialogue out of paragraph text. The role of Atton eventually went to Nicky Katt, as he was a fresh voice who was not part of the \\"usual pool of voice actors who have performed in most video games at the time\\" according to Beckman and O'Farrell. They also noted Katt's physical resemblance to Menze's concept drawings of the character. Atton was featured in a number of plot scenarios that were eventually cut from the final game. One particular cut content of note is a boss encounter which hinges on Atton's solitary participation at a predetermined point in the narrative, where the player assumes control of him to fight off the Sith Lord Darth Sion. In one proposed ending, if the Exile is female, he would die from wounds inflicted by Sion if defeated in the boss battle, and as he lays dying in the Exile‚Äôs arms, he confesses that he loved her all along. Members of The Sith Lords fan community group pieced together a narrative through the fragmented code, which included innumerable unused original assets and voice- over recordings, and incorporated these alterations into a mod known as The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod or TSLRCM, which has seen intermittent updates in the years after the game's original release. Character Atton Rand is depicted as a roguish scoundrel who is an avid player of the Pazaak card game, and hides his dark past behind a laidback attitude; his irreverent style and predilection for Pazaak are part of the mental defenses he has built against the mind manipulation abilities of Force users. Atton and his sense of humour serve as a counterweight and foil to Kreia's dour lectures as the Exile's mentor, balancing her crusty tone by acting as comic relief and making snarky quips about every character and every situation that he encounters. As part of his back story, Atton was once an airman in service of the Republic army, who grew to despise the Jedi Order and came to see them as hypocritical cowards who swear fealty to the Republic but fail to step up when they are needed. He later joined Revan's cause, and underwent intensive training to become a deadly hunter of Jedi. When recounting his experience of being an assassin for the Sith, Atton claims there is no functional difference between the opposing factions as the average person does not care about what side of the Force someone is on, though he is haunted by his internalized guilt of murdering Jedi and considers himself to be beyond forgiveness. If the player accumulates enough influence with Atton, he develops a genuine respect for the Exile and chooses to follow them of his own volition, even allowing himself to be trained as an apprenticed Force user. Atton may also develop feelings for a female player character, though there is no fully fledged romance in the original release. Atton is an example of a stock character who makes throwback references to other works in the Star Wars media franchise, such as Han Solo's signature \\"I have a bad feeling about this\\" quote. Under certain conditions, for example if the player complete the game at least once, Atton will break the fourth wall during his introductory conversation with the Exile in the next play-through, such as explaining the origins of his name or lampooning a young Anakin Skywalker's first line of dialogue to Padme Amidala in Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace. Appearances Atton is a human pilot that the Jedi Exile meets on the asteroid mining station Peragus II. After the Exile frees him from a force cage at the facility and cooperates with him to escape, Atton reluctantly joins them in their travels. When Kreia discovers Atton‚Äôs past when they were imprisoned by the Jedi historian Atris on the planet Telos, she uses the information to blackmail him into remaining with the Exile's party as pilot of The Ebon Hawk. The Exile may also learn about Atton's proficiency in Echani combat techniques from speaking with Atris' Echani handmaidens, a fact which he attempts to cover up and feign ignorance about if questioned. The Exile may later speak with a Twi'lek non-player character in the Refugee Sector in Nar Shadaa who reveals that he is an old acquaintance of Atton and knows about his secret. If the Exile accrues enough influence and successfully convinces Atton to reveal the truth about his past, he will reveal some incriminating details about himself, including the fact that he has fought in the Mandalorian Wars as well as the Jedi Civil War. Atton explains that he originally served with the Republic military forces under Revan's command, and when Revan fell to the dark side and turned on the government the Jedi had sworn to protect, Atton along with many other Republic military forces remained loyal to Revan, whom they consider to be their savior. During the Jedi Civil War, Atton was part of an elite Sith assassin unit, trained to resist Jedi Force powers and sent on missions to kill or capture Jedi to be broken and converted to the Sith. Later during the war, Atton was confronted by a female Jedi who informed him of his Force-sensitive nature and warned him that the Sith would undoubtedly compel him to train as a Dark Jedi if they find out about it. Atton struck her down, but before her death, she opened up her mind to his, giving him a glimpse of the Force as she saw it. Enraged, Atton killed her, though the impression she left caused him to become disillusioned, and he eventually deserted the Sith. The Exile has the option to forgive Atton, who is expecting to be punished for his crimes. At his request, he may be trained in the ways of the Jedi Sentinel, and he may be influenced to follow either the light or dark side of the Force. Atton continues to travel with the Exile, participating in the defense of Telos against a Sith armada led by Darth Nihilus and, shortly after, taking the Exile to Malachor V where they went on to defeat Darth Sion and Darth Traya. Within the established Star Wars Legends continuity, Atton along several of the Exile's companions are supposed to survive the events of the game and help rebuild the Jedi Order; Kreia will prophesy their fates following her defeat if questioned by the Exile. If the Jedi Exile is female, as is the case with the canonical character Meetra Surik, the nature of Atton's relationship with her will be addressed through a few dialogue changes; however, the ending would be the same. The resolution of Atton's character arc in Trayus Academy on the planet Malachor V was cut in its entirety in the final release of The Sith Lords. If a fan mod which restores the cut content is installed, Atton encounters Darth Sion after he flees from Kreia, who has reassumed her title as Darth Traya and incapacitates the Exile's other companions who have attempted to confront her. If Atton defeats Sion and survives the duel, he will escape with his life. Should Atton turn to the dark side and have a low influence rating with a player character who is female, he will attack fellow party member Mical out of jealousy for her affections. Other appearances The character makes no further appearances in Star Wars media works, though Atton has been mentioned in the MMO role playing game Star Wars: The Old Republic as well as several Star Wars reference books, such as Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force and the second volume of The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia. In addition, Wizards of the Coast created a miniature for the character, along with other characters in the Knights of the Old Republic series, which was released August 19, 2008. Reception Atton Rand's critical reception has been positive; while many sources commented on the apparent similarities between the character and Han Solo, Atton has also been praised for his layered, well-written characterization as a thought provoking subversion of similar character archetypes. Hilary Goldstein from IGN initially found Atton's constant attempts to imitate Han Solo in the early narrative to be annoying, but remarked that his characterization in the later portions of the game would surprise many players due to the dark secrets he hides behind his \\"ho-hum surface\\". Sam Dunn from Fan Sided noted that Atton claims \\"rare territory among cut-rate Han Solos, as he‚Äôs neither smuggler nor bounty hunter nor pirate\\". Atton has also been positively compared to Carth Onasi from the first game, with the former being considered the more interesting character. In an article published by The Escapist, OnlySP staff formed the view that Kreia and Atton stick out as strong examples of good characterization in The Sith Lords, lauding the latter for his \\"genuinely funny quips and a mellow attitude\\". Jen Rothery, a staff writer at PCGamesN, described her favorite The Sith Lords character as \\"enigmatic, charming, and flirtatious\\". Caleb Bailey from CBR ranked Atton's fourth wall breaking comments second on a list of unforgettably funny moments from the Star Wars Legends universe. Brian Winters, also from CBR, ranked Atton fourth on a list of Jedi characters from the various Star Wars Legends works that deserve to be more celebrated. Atton's character arc has been praised for its depth. Fraser Brown from PCGamesN remarked that the optional content which allows the player to gain influence with Atton, steer his moral alignment to match the player character's and finally train him as a Force user, is a good example of a side quest which could be just as important as the main quest. Brown recalled that in his playthrough, he moulded Atton's personality into a heartless killer after the character breaks down emotionally and confesses his secret to his character about his murder of the Jedi who revealed his Force sensitive nature; he remarked that the choices he made which concludes the exploration of Atton's past were morally disturbing, but also compelling as a gameplay experience. Rothery said The Sith Lords as a whole is a compelling albeit atypical Star Wars story; the theme of Atton's story arc revolves around an individual‚Äôs relationship with the Force, and his attempt to deal with the actions of his past. Nicky Katt's performance as Atton Rand has been well received. Beckman and O'Farrell praised Katt for bringing the \\"tempo and energy needed to carry that first part of the game where he has a lot of dialogue\\". Dunn praised \\"the sheer snark\\" Katt projected through the character's \\"arsenal of quick-draw one-liners\\". Jen Rothery from PCGamesN recalled that Katt's performance was a major part of the character's appeal and got her interested in his body of work as an actor. Following the implementation of Steam workshop support for the game in July 2015, multiple sources have recommended The Sith Lords: Restored Content Mod or \\"TSLRCM\\" as an essential gameplay experience for addressing the various story arc discrepancies of The Sith Lords. Matthew Byrd from Den of Geek considered Atton to be one of the game's most important characters, and praised the fan- restored encounter with Darth Sion for providing a proper conclusion to the most enjoyable character story arc of The Sith Lords in his view. Rothery revisited The Sith Lords 15 years after her last playthrough with TSLRCM installed, and remarked that while the mod gave her closure as she had declined to finish the game due to her discovery of Atton's endgame content being removed in the final release, she did appreciate the original release of the game just as deeply during her younger years and that she funneled the emotional impact the game had on her \\"through the lens of romantic obsession\\". William Hughes from The A.V. Club drew from his experience of Atton's endgame arc as part of the restored content to reflect on the themes of loss, and how a deliberate choice to lose a gameplay challenge \\"makes for a better story than a win ever possibly could\\". Byrd as well as Luke Winkie from Paste Magazine cited the TSLRCM project as proof of the dedication from the game's fanbase to salvage unused assets buried within the game's code and fix the narrative arcs for certain characters, with Winkie remarking that \\"It seems almost criminal that players didn‚Äôt get to watch these scenes pay off on the disc. These characters meant something to people. Putting them out to pasture in crunchtime isn‚Äôt fair\\". Analysis Travis Annabel from IGN noted that redemption is a core theme to any Star Wars story; while characters like Atton have the opportunity to redeem himself for his past crimes, Annabel remarked that few of the game's main cast members are truly altruistic, which makes their narrative journey through the story of The Sith Lords much more interesting. Alexandra Jekic from Norwegian website Gamer claimed that Atton is an unreliable man with villainous traits yet comes across as strangely sympathetic at the same time, and that he is an example of a lost and unhappy character who had learned to live with the kind of person he has become, which she considers to be a recurring trope in Chris Avellone's writing work. Phil Owen from Kotaku remarked that \\"there are always reasons people follow evil leaders beyond those people themselves being evil\\", singling out Atton as an example who \\"puts a sympathetic face on those enemy hordes\\" and whose moral convictions is not rooted in rigid notions of good or evil, and noted that \\"the game truly is awash in grey areas\\". Atton's role within the game is positioned to assert the lack of distinction between Jedi and Sith Orders from the masses' point of view, save that both sides possess powers capable of immense destruction. Owen discussed an early game conversation with Atton where the player character may argue with him over rumors and hearsay about how the aftermath of the so-called Jedi Civil War in the first game affects present events; aside from its primary function of maintaining continuity between the two games, a point is also made that it is irrelevant whether the Jedi-backed Republic or the Sith won the war within the wider context of the Knights of the Old Republic series' setting. In a research dissertation submitted to Edge Hill University, Eamon Reid emphasized dialogue exposition from Atton that highlights the unemployment crisis and callous exploitation faced by refugees in Nar Shadaa, which count many displaced war veterans hailing from all sides among their number, as a direct byproduct of the preceding wars. The reveal of Atton's backstory also highlights his personal suffering as he is caught in the constant violent struggles between the Jedi and Sith. An editorial published by the Official Xbox Magazine argued that since The Sith Lords \\"takes a universe of light and dark, and paints it in shades of grey\\", both factions' single-minded pursuit for balance of the Force could be compared to a religious schism, which holds little relevance for the rest of the galaxy but results in far reaching collateral damage. Hughes said Atton's death at the hands of Darth Sion, a potential scenario restored by the TSLRCM mod, turned to be a profoundly sad and moving moment for him. He remarked that if he had persisted on winning the boss fight as Atton and deliberately refused to lose, he would have missed out on that experience. He observed that players get attached to characters because they stay around for a while, and over time players would get emotionally attached to these characters and would want them to continue sticking around, and concluded that losing a character \\"almost always comes through story-mandated deaths outside the player‚Äôs control, instead of as a consequence of their own actions\\".

The Lusty Lady was made famous by the labor activism of its San Francisco workers and the publication of several books about working there. History The Seattle Lusty Lady, known originally as the Amusement Center, was opened in the 1970s by two business associates, who soon after opened the other location in San Francisco. Originally, both Lusty Ladys showed 16mm peep show films only; in 1983 live nude dancers were added and became the main focus of the businesses.\\"A Brief History of the Lusty Lady Theater\\" , Lusty Lady San Francisco website. Until 2003 they were both owned by the same company; in that year the San Francisco franchise was bought by the strippers working there and began to be managed as a worker cooperative. The San Francisco branch had already entered the news in 1997 when it became the first (and only) successfully unionized sex business in the U.S.\\"S.F.

Accessed online 2012-12-05. The San Francisco branch closed at 3 a.m. on September 2, 2013 on Labor Day. Operation The Lusty Lady featured exotic dancers in a peep show setting on a main stage and in one-on-one booths. The main stage featured several nude women dancing, separated by glass windows from the customers who each stood in their own booth, paying by the minute. The dancers were also available for more explicit private shows in the VIP and Private Pleasures booths. These were also glass-separated private booths where customers could give direction to the show and tipping was possible. Rates for shows varied by dancer. The Private Pleasures booth also occasionally featured \\"Double Trouble\\" shows, with two dancers who might have performed a lesbian sex show. In addition, booths showing adult videos 24/7 were available. Once a year, The Lusty Lady SF organized a \\"Play Day\\": the dancers came out from behind the glass, explained the operation of the club to customers, and allowed behind- the-scenes peeks.Merry XXXmas to All by Leah Greenblatt, Seattle Weekly, December 11, 2002\\"Events\\" , Lusty Lady San Francisco website. Lusty Lady occasionally featured \\"art days\\", exhibiting erotic photographs and paintings in the hallways. In February 2002, both peep shows featured a video art exhibition called \\"Peepshow 28\\", with one channel in all video booths devoted to showing a sequence of 64 short videos exploring voyeurism, exhibitionism and sexuality.\\"Peepshow Gets an Artistic Implant\\", by Robin Clewley, Wired, January 21, 2002.Peeping by Bethany Jean Clement, Seattle Weekly, February 14, 2002.

Nirvana‚Äôs logo was also inspired by a sign at the lusty lady which said have an erotic day by Rick Anderson, Seattle Weekly, March 29, 2006 The club was well known for its frequently changing and often amusing marquee announcements.\\"Seattle's Irreverent Marquee is no Bust\\" by Robert L. Jamieson Jr., Seattle Post- Intelligencer, March 17, 2001.

On Sunday April 11, 2010, the Lusty Lady in Seattle announced that it would close its doors for business in June. The economic climate and the rise of Internet pornography were cited as reasons for closing. On June 28, 2010, the Lusty Lady marquee was removed from the Seattle location. It was acquired by the Museum of History & Industry and is now on display at their museum in the South Lake Union neighborhood. In the wake of the Lusty Lady announcing its shutdown, the NPR program All Things Considered did a story focusing on the peep show's history and relationship to the broader downtown Seattle community. Books The 1997 book The Lusty Lady by photographer Erika Langley documents the work in the Seattle branch of Lusty Lady. It includes photos by Langley (who had worked there as a dancer since 1992) as well as essays by a number of Lusty Lady dancers, who vary considerably in their attitudes toward their customers and toward their work.Review of The Lusty Lady by E.

It was open 24 hours a day, though the live stage was closed between 3 and 11 AM. Unionization Several grievances led to the unionizing effort in 1997. African American feminist sociologist Siobhan Brooks while working at the club had noticed that African American dancers were discriminated against and filed a complaint. The precipitating event was the installation of one-way mirrors in a number of booths (which also exist in the Seattle branch), resulting in some customers taking photos and videos of the show.\\"Lusty Lady Dancers Ratify Union Contract\\", by David Steinberg, Comes Naturally #58, May 2, 1997.Laurel Druley: \\"Lusty Labor\\", Mother Jones, January 6, 1998.

Float of the Lusty Lady at the 2008 San Francisco Pride parade Among the leaders of the organizing drive was the stripper Julia Query who documented the efforts on video, resulting in the documentary Live Nude Girls Unite!, written and directed by Vicky Funari and Julia Query. After a vote of the employees, the business was organized by the Exotic Dancers Union, an affiliate of Service Employees International Union, then a member of AFL-CIO, Local 790. The Bay Area Sex Worker Advocacy Network (BAYSWAN) provided website support for the workers' unionization effort, which helped to garner public support for the workers as well as inquiries from other exotic dancers and sex workers throughout the country.Irvine, Martha. (1997-04-12). \\"Strippers get ground- breaking labor pact.\\" Associated Press. Former Lusty Lady employee Siobhan Brooks commented in a 1997 article that \\"In some cases the media misquoted us as being the first strip club to unionize. But the first strip club to unionize was Pacer's in San Diego. However, Pacer's union, Hotel Management, Employee Management, Local 30, negotiated an open clause in its contract. Open shop means there's no requirement that employees join the union, so the club recruited workers and discouraged them from joining the union and were able to decertify the union.\\" Worker cooperative After management cut hourly compensation at the San Francisco Lusty Lady in 2003, the workers struck and won, but the closure of the peep show was announced soon after. The subsequent efforts to turn the club into a worker cooperative were led by Donna Delinqua (stage name), a stripper and graduate student in English.

While dancers had been regularly evaluated by managers before, now a peer review process was established wherein dancers evaluate each other. The team leaders are elected from among the dancers for six month terms. A dispute began in the summer of 2006 when a male employee wrote a confidential email to the co-op board, complaining that hiring of too many heavy women drove customers away, thus lowering every employee's income. One member of the board posted the message on a message board, causing considerable consternation among dancers. The board member was dismissed.\\"S.F. strip club's hefty lady show sparks tempest\\" by Phillip Matier and Andrew Ross, San Francisco Chronicle, October 2, 2006 Two of the male employees have argued that the union should be abandoned as not useful in a worker-owned cooperative. On its website, the Lusty Lady describes a worker-owned business as \\"a rare and ideal situation\\" but \\"not without its challenges\\" and discusses how the workers address these challenges. On Tuesday August 20, 2013, the Lusty Lady in San Francisco announced that it would close its doors for business in just two weeks, on Monday at 3:00 a.m. September 2, 2013. The landlord, Roger Forbes (part of Deja Vu Consulting Inc. which by that time owned almost every strip club in San Francisco with the exception of Crazy Horse, Mitchell Brothers O‚ÄôFarrell Theatre, and Nob Hill) refused to renew the lease after attempts to re-negotiate the rent failed.

Biography He was born in London on 20 November 1809. His father, Samuel Chappell, soon after the son's birth, entered into partnership with Johann Baptist Cramer and F. T. Latour, and opened a music publishing business at 124 New Bond Street. In 1826, he became sole partner, and in 1830 was established at 50 New Bond Street, where he died in December 1834. William, his eldest son, then managed the business for his mother until 1843. Chappell began the study of English folk-tunes and ballads. In 1838, he issued his first work, A Collection of National English Airs, consisting of Ancient Song, Ballad, and Dance Tunes, in two volumes, one containing 245 tunes, the second some elucidatory remarks and an essay on English minstrelsy. The airs were harmonised by Macfarren, Dr. Crotch, and Wade; only Macfarren's were adequate. Wade's being too slight, and Crotch's too elaborate. Chappell was the first who seriously studied traditional English tunes. In 1840, Chappell became a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. He took an active part in the formation of the Percy Society, for which he edited Johnson's Crown Garland of Golden Roses. He projected the Musical Antiquarian Society, to publish and perform early English compositions, and established madrigal-singing by a small choir at his premises in New Bond Street. Most of the leading English musicians joined the society, which began publishing in 1841; Chappell acted as treasurer and manager of the publications for about five years. He edited the twelfth volume, Dowland's First Booke of Songes or Ayres, but inexplicably omitted Dowland's accompaniments. The society's publications were in cumbersome and expensive folios, and the members soon fell away until the society dissolved in 1848. The Chappell family had in 1843 made an arrangement by virtue of which William retired from the business. In 1845, he bought a share in the publishing business of Cramer & Co., which was then called Cramer, Beale, & Chappell.Chappell, W. (William), 1809‚Äì1888, compiler, Harvard College Library He patiently continued his investigations into antiquarian music, and waited till 1855 before issuing an improved edition of his collection. It was renamed Popular Music of the Olden Time, and arranged in two octavo volumes, letterpress and music interspersed. The tunes were harmonised by Macfarren. Immense learning and research are displayed throughout the work, which at once became the recognised authority upon the subject. It suffers from Chappell's prejudices against Scotland and everything Scottish; and Dr. Burney, who did not appreciate Elizabethan madrigals, is repeatedly attacked with unjustifiable exaggeration, notably in the preface. A new edition, edited by Professor H. E. Wooldridge, appeared in 1892, with the title Old English Popular Music, and the tunes re-harmonised on the basis of the medi√¶val modes; this edition is practically a new work. In 1861, Chappell retired from the firm of Cramer & Co. He suffered from writers' palsy for several years, but eventually recovered. He acted as honorary treasurer of the Ballad Society, for which he edited three volumes of the Roxburgh Ballads (London, 1869 &c.; 8vo). He was also an active member, and for a time treasurer, of the Camden Society. He gave most important assistance in the publication of Coussemaker's Scriptores de Musica (4 tom. Paris, 1863‚Äì76). The celebrated double canon, Sumer is icumen in, whose existence in a thirteenth- century manuscript is the most inexplicable phenomenon in the history of music, was long studied by Chappell; a facsimile in colours served as the frontispiece of his Popular Music of the Olden Time, and he finally succeeded in identifying the handwriting as the work of Johannes de Fornsete, and in showing that the writer died on 19 January 1239 or 1240. At the foundation of the Musical Association in 1874, he was appointed a vice-president, and on 6 November 1877, he read a profound and original paper on Music a Science of Numbers. During the latter part of his life he lived mostly at Weybridge, but died at his London residence, 53 Upper Brook Street, on 20 August 1888.

It was directed by Roger Vadim, and stars Jeanne Moreau, Gerard Phillipe, and Annette Vadim. It was a French/Italian co-production. Synopsis In present-day France, Valmont and Juliette de Merteuil are a married couple who help each other have extramarital affairs. Juliette's latest lover, Court, breaks up with her in order to be free to pursue his plan to marry the 16-year-old Cecile. Seeking revenge, Juliette encourages Valmont to seduce the virginal Cecile while she holidays at the ski resort of Meg√®ve. Cecile is in love with a student, Danceny, but he refuses to marry her until he can support her. While on holiday, Valmont meets the beautiful and virtuous Marianne, originally from Denmark, who has a small child and is happily married to a young civil servant. He decides to pursue her as well, at first by befriending her and being completely honest as to what sort of person he is. Valmont succeeds in seducing the virginal Cecile by blackmailing her. Cecile confesses the act to Juliette who encourages her to keep seeing Valmont, and Cecile does so. Valmont then follows Marianne to Paris and succeeds in seducing her as well. Eventually Valmont genuinely falls in love with Marianne, and she prepares to leave her husband for him. Juliette becomes jealous and sends Marianne a telegram supposedly from Valmont, but with Valmont's reluctant consent, breaking it off with her and saying the seduction was all a game. Cecile tells Juliette that she is pregnant by Valmont and asks for her help in persuading Danceny to marry her. Instead, Juliette tells Danceny that he should not marry and plans to seduce Danceny herself. Valmont and Cecile tell Danceny about Juliette's duplicity. However, Juliette then tells him that Cecile and Valmont slept together, and Danceny strikes Valmont, accidentally killing him. While Danceny faces murder charges, Marianne loses her reason with the shock of Valmont's rejection of her and subsequent death. Valmont has written letters to Juliette throughout the film describing both their actions. Juliette burns the letters, but catches fire herself and is disfigured for life doing so.

Selfmates were once known as sui-mates. Example The problem shown is a relatively simple example. It is a selfmate in two by Wolfgang PaulyPauly selfmateW. Pauly from The Theory of Pawn Promotion, 1912: White moves first, and compels Black to deliver checkmate on or before Black's second move. If White can leave Black with no option but to play Bxg2#, the problem is solved. * White might try moving the bishop, but this is no good, as it will allow Black to play a non-capturing bishop move himself, delaying the mate beyond move two; * moving the knight allows the king to move; * 1.e6 allows 1...exf6 and 2...f5; * 1.f7 or 1.fxe7 allows 1...Kxg7; * 1.g8=Q or 1.g8=R are no good after 1...Bxg2+ 2.Q/Rxg2; * 1.g8=N# checkmates Black, which is entirely wrong; * 1.g8=B is also no good, since after 1...exf6 2.exf6 Bxg2+ the bishop can interpose with 3.Bd5. The only move by which White can force Black to deliver checkmate on or before move two is 1.c8=N. There are two variations: * 1...exf6 2.exf6 Bxg2# is a selfmate; * 1...e6 allows 2.g8=B (the e6 pawn blocks 3.Bd5), forcing 2...Bxg2# and selfmate. Note that only a promotion to a knight works on move one: any other piece would be able to interpose after 1...Bxg2+. Variations A derivative of the selfmate is the reflexmate, in which White compels Black to give mate with the added condition that if either player can give mate, they must (when this condition applies only to Black, it is a semi-reflexmate). There is also the maximummer, in which Black must always make the geometrically longest move available, as measured from square- centre to square-centre; although this condition is sometimes found in other types of problems, it is most common in selfmates. Another variation is the series-selfmate, a type of seriesmover in which White makes a series of moves without reply, at the end of which Black makes one move and is compelled to give mate.

Artaud, who was briefly a member of the surrealist movement, outlined his theories in The Theatre and its Double. The Theatre of Cruelty can be seen as a break from traditional Western theatre and a means by which artists assault the senses of the audience. Artaud's works have been highly influential on artists including Jean Genet, Jerzy Grotowski, Peter Brook, and Romeo Castellucci. History Antonin Artaud was well known as an actor, playwright, and essayist of avant-garde theatre, and briefly a member of the surrealist movement in Paris from 1924 - 1926, before his 'radical independence and his uncontrollable personality, perpetually in revolt, brought about his excommunication by Andr√© Breton.' Much of the avant-garde theatre developed in France from 1914 to 1939 can be seen as a revolt against tradition. Deeply affected by the events of World War I, the artists of the movement felt increasing skepticism of the existing societal structures that had allowed for global warfare. While Artaud would eventually break away from surrealism, the movement helped to shape his later theories on the Theatre of Cruelty. Led by Andr√© Breton, surrealist theatre reflected a belief that the unconscious mind is a source of artistic truth. In his manifesto on surrealism, Breton writes, \\"pure psychic automatism, by which is intended to express, verbally, in writing, or by other means, the real process of thought. Thought's dictation, in absence of all control exercised by the reason and outside all esthetic or moral preoccupation.\\" In 1926, in association with surrealist playwright Roger Vitrac, Artaud founded the Theatre Alfred Jarry, which only produced non-realistic drama. The theatre lasted only two years. After his work in surrealist theatre, Artaud went on to develop his theories on the Theatre of Cruelty after he was inspired by a Balinese dance troupe performance that he viewed at the Paris Colonial Exhibit in 1931. The performance conventions of Balinese dance were different from any Artaud had previously experienced, and he was struck by the intense physicality of the dancers. Artaud went on to publish his major work on the Theatre of Cruelty, The Theatre and Its Double, seven years later in 1938. Theory Antonin ArtaudEncyclop√¶dia Britannica describes the Theatre of Cruelty as \\"a primitive ceremonial experience intended to liberate the human subconscious and reveal man to himself\\". It goes on to say that Manifeste du th√©√¢tre de la cruaut√© (1932; Manifesto of the Theatre of Cruelty) and Le Th√©√¢tre et son double (1938; The Theatre and Its Double) both called for \\"communion between actor and audience in a magic exorcism; gestures, sounds, unusual scenery, and lighting combine to form a language, superior to words, that can be used to subvert thought and logic and to shock the spectator into seeing the baseness of his world.\\" Artaud warned against the dangers of psychology in theater and strove to create a theater in which the mise-en-sc√®ne, everything present in the staging of a production, could be understood as a codified stage language, with minimal emphasis on spoken language. Defining Artaud's \\"theatre\\" and \\"cruelty\\" In his writings on the Theatre of Cruelty, Artaud notes that both \\"theatre\\" and \\"cruelty\\" that are separate from their colloquial meanings. For Artaud, theatre does not merely refer to a staged performance before a passive audience. The theatre is a practice, which \\"wakes us up. Nerves and heart,\\" and through which we experience, \\"immediate violent action,\\" that \\"inspires us with the fiery magnetism of its images and acts upon us like a spiritual therapeutics whose touch can never be forgotten.\\" Similarly, cruelty does not refer to an act of emotional or physical violence. According to scholar Nathan Gorelick, > Cruelty is, more profoundly, the unrelenting agitation of a life that has > become unnecessary, lazy, or removed from a compelling force. The Theatre of > Cruelty gives expression to everything that is ‚Äòcrime, love, war, or > madness' in order to ‚Äòunforgettably root within us the ideas of perpetual > conflict, a spasm in which life is continually lacerated, in which > everything in creation rises up and asserts itself against our appointed > rank. For Artaud, cruelty is not exclusively sadism or causing pain, but just as often a violent, physical determination to shatter a false reality. He believed that text had been a tyrant over meaning, and advocated, instead, for a theatre made up of a unique language, halfway between thought and gesture. Artaud described the spiritual in physical terms, and believed that all theatre is physical expression in space.Evidently, Artaud's various uses of the term cruelty must be examined to fully understand his ideas. Lee Jamieson has identified four ways in which Artaud used the term cruelty. First, it is employed metaphorically to describe the essence of human existence.Artaud's second use of the term (according to Jamieson), is as a form of discipline. Although Artaud wanted to \\"reject form and incite chaos\\" (Jamieson, p. 22), he also promoted strict discipline and rigor in his performance techniques. A third use of the term was 'cruelty as theatrical presentation'. The Theatre of Cruelty aimed to hurl the spectator into the centre of the action, forcing them to engage with the performance on an instinctive level. For Artaud, this was a cruel, yet necessary act upon the spectator, designed to shock them out of their complacency:Artaud wanted to put the audience in the middle of the 'spectacle' (his term for the play), so they would be 'engulfed and physically affected by it'. He referred to this layout as being like a 'vortex' ‚Äì a constantly shifting shape ‚Äì 'to be trapped and powerless'. He also placed a great emphasis on sound rather than words or dialogue, by incorporating loud cries, screams, eerie sounds, or noises causing the audience to become uncomfortable. Words were an insufficient medium of expression. Finally, Artaud used the term to describe his philosophical views. Break with Western theatre In The Theatre and Its Double, Artaud expressed his admiration for Eastern forms of theatre, particularly the Balinese. Artaud felt that the focus of theatre in the west had become far too narrow‚Äîprimarily examining the psychological suffering of individuals or the societal struggles of specific groups of people. He wanted to delve into the aspects of the subconscious that he believed were often the root cause of human being's mistreatment of one another. Through an assault on the audiences' senses, Artaud was convinced that a theatrical experience could help people purge destructive feelings and experience the joy that society forces them to repress. For Artaud, \\"the theatre has been created to drain abscesses collectively.\\" Insufficiency of language Artaud believed that language was an entirely insufficient means to express trauma. Accordingly, he felt that words should be stripped of meaning and chosen for their phonic elements. According to scholar Robert Vork, \\"Speech on the Theatre of Cruelty's stage is reduced to inarticulate sounds, cries, and gibbering screams, no longer inviting a subject into being but seeking to preclude its very existence.\\" Somewhat paradoxically, Artaud claims that his characters are able to express things that others are unable to say. Vork claims, \\"Artaud seems to be suggesting that his play reveals emotions and experiences that we all attempt to proscribe and are unwilling to acknowledge, but which nevertheless occur.\\" \\"Impossible theatre\\" Stephen Barber explains that \\"the Theatre of Cruelty has often been called an 'impossible theatre'‚Äîvital for the purity of inspiration which it generated, but hopelessly vague and metaphorical in its concrete detail.\\" This impossibility has not prevented others from articulating a version of his principles as the basis for explorations of their own. \\"Though many of those theatre-artists proclaimed an Artaudian lineage,\\" Susie Tharu argues, \\"the Artaud they invoke is marked by a commitment as ahistorical and transcendent as their own.\\" There is, she suggests, another Artaud and \\"the tradition he was midwife to.\\"See Tharu (1984). Productions and staging Artaud wanted to abolish the stage and auditorium, and to do away with sets and props and masks. He envisioned the performance space as an empty room with the audience seated in the center and the actors performing all around them. The stage effects included overwhelming sounds and bright lights in order to stun the audience's sensibilities and completely immerse them in the theatrical experience. Artaud believed that he could erode an audience's resistance by using these methods, \\"addressed first of all to the senses rather than to the mind,\\" because, \\"the public thinks first with all of its senses.\\" In his lifetime, Artaud only produced one play that put the theories of the Theatre of Cruelty into practice. He staged and directed Les Cenci, adapted from the dramatic work of the same title by Percy Bysshe Shelley, in 1935 at the Th√©√¢tre des Folies-Wagram in Paris. The play was neither a commercial or critical success and ran for only 17 performances. Artaud, however, believed that, while he was forced to limit the scope of his vision due to financial constraints, Les Cenci succeeded in exemplifying the tenets of the Theatre of Cruelty. Legacy According to scholar Pericles Lewis, the influences of the Theatre of Cruelty can most clearly be seen in the works of Jean Genet, a post World War II playwright. His plays featured ritualized murder and systemic oppression in order to show the negative consequences and suffering caused by political subjugation. In the 1960s, a number of directors began to incorporate Artaud's theories and staging practices in their work, including Jerzy Grotowski at the Theater Laboratory in Poland. In England, famed theatre director Peter Brook experimented with the Theatre of Cruelty in a series of workshops at the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC). These experiments are reflected in his direction and staging of RSC's lauded 1966 production of Marat/Sade, a play with music by Peter Weiss. Marat/Sade uses dramatic devices developed by both Artaud and Brecht to depict class struggle and human suffering in the midst of changing social structures. The German dramatist Heiner M√ºller argues that we have yet to feel or to appreciate fully Artaud's contribution to theatrical culture; his ideas are, M√ºller implies, 'untimely' :For the Brecht-Artaud dialogue in postmodern theatre, see Wright (1989), Price (1990), and Howe Kritzer (1991).\\"The emergency is Artaud. He tore literature away from the police, theater away from medicine. Under the sun of torture, which shines equally on all the continents of this planet, his texts blossom. Read on the ruins of Europe, they will be classics.\\"M√ºller (1977), p. 175. Modern activist application In 2011, a group of geography and sociology professors used the Theatre of Cruelty as a conceptual, experience based technique to explore the agrarian struggle and deforestation in the Amazon Basin. These professors: \\"‚Ä¶suggest that theater, more generally, provides structure for cruel performance, and that violent land conflict, together with forest destruction, constitutes a predictable tragedy of theatrical events. In other words, violent land conflict in Amazonia, with all its terrible implication for people and environment, can be grasped as a theatrical structure with philosophic and material consequences for mind and body.\\"Walker (2011) See also *Theatre of the Absurd *Living Theatre *Panic Movement *Experimental theatre *Theatre of France CitationsReferences * Antonin Artaud, Mary C.

Both the groom and the bride are to consent to the marriage of their own free wills. A formal, binding contract ‚Äì verbal or on paper ‚Äì is considered integral to a religiously valid Islamic marriage, and outlines the rights and responsibilities of the groom and bride. Divorce in Islam can take a variety of forms, some executed by a husband personally and some executed by a religious court on behalf of a plaintiff wife who is successful in her legal divorce petition for valid cause. In addition to the usual marriage until death or divorce, there is a different fixed-term marriage known as zawƒÅj al-mut ªah (\\"pleasure marriage\\")Wehr, Hans.

There is also Nikah Misyar, a non-temporary marriage with the removal of some conditions such as living together, permitted by some Sunni scholars.  Terminology  In Islamic law, marriage ‚Äì or more specifically, the marriage contract ‚Äì is called , an Arabic word which already in the Quran is used exclusively to refer to the contract of marriage.Vincent J. Cornell (2007), Voices of life: family, home, and society. p. 59‚Äì60 (Marriage in Islam by Nargis Virani). In the Wehr-Cowan Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic, is defined as \\"marriage; marriage contract; matrimony, wedlock\\". (At least in some marriages in some Muslim cultures such as Pakistan, there may be a delay between the nikkah and the rukhsati -- when the husband, having obtained a good job and home, has the wife move in with him.) In Arabic-speaking countries, marriage is commonly called zawƒÅj (, from the Quranic term zawj (), referring to a member of a pair), and this term has recently gained currency among Muslim speakers of other languages as well. The marriage contract is known by different names: Literary Arabic: ', \\"matrimony contract\\"; / ALA-LC: '; ; \\"marriage\\" and or (, ) for the certificate. The marriage celebration may be called  øurs / zawƒÅj (), ezdewaj/arusi (Persian), shaadi (Urdu), biye/biya (Bengali) or d√ºƒü√ºn (Turkish). History In Arabia before the advent of Islam in the 7th century CE, a variety of different marriage practices existed. The most common and recognized types of marriage at this time consisted of: marriage by agreement, marriage by capture, marriage by mahr, marriage by inheritance and \\"Mot'a\\" or temporary marriage. In Mesopotamia, marriages were generally monogamous, except among royalty, who would have harems consisting of wives and concubines. The Sasanian society followed Zoroastrianism, which viewed women to be possessions in marriage, although consent was required in both marriage and divorce. According to Islamic sources, most women in pre-7th century Arabia had little control over their marriages. They were rarely bound by contract for marriage or custody of children and their consent was rarely sought. Women were seldom allowed to divorce their husbands and their view was not regarded for either a marriage or divorce. However, in the transitional age from non-Islamic to Islamic society, elite women could divorce and remarry without stigma. They were given the power to negotiate the terms of their marriage contract, and could even initiate divorce. Reforms with Islam Muhammad had reformed the laws and procedures of the common marriage practices that existed during his prophethood. The rules of \\"marriage by agreement (marriage through consent)\\" was reformed and a strict set of rules and regulations were put in place. The practices of \\"marriage by inheritance\\" was forbidden. Several chapters and verses from the Quran were revealed which banned such practices. Under the Arabian Jahiliyyah law, Islamic sources allege that no limitations were set on men's rights to marry or to obtain a divorce.Khadduri (1978) Islamic law limited men to four wives at one time, not including concubines. ()Esposito (2005) p. 79 The institution of marriage was refined into one in which the woman was somewhat of an interested partner. 'For example, the dowry, previously regarded as a bride-price paid to the father, became a nuptial gift retained by the wife as part of her personal property' Under Islamic law, marriage was no longer viewed as a \\"status\\" but rather as a \\"contract\\". The essential elements of the marriage contract were now an offer by the man, an acceptance by the woman, and the performance of such conditions as the payment of dowry. The woman's consent, given either actively or by silence, was required. Furthermore, the offer and acceptance had to be made in the presence of at least two witnesses.Esposito (2004), p. 339 A married woman had the right to be given food and clothes by her husband, though her husband had more rights over her: \\"I enjoin good treatment of women, for they are prisoners with you, and you have no right to treat them otherwise, unless they commit clear indecency. If they do that, then forsake them in their beds and hit them, but without causing injury or leaving a mark. If they obey you, then do not seek means of annoyance against them. You have rights over your women and your women have rights over you. Your rights over your women are that they are not to allow anyone whom you dislike to tread on your bedding (furniture), nor allow anyone whom you dislike to enter your houses. And their right over you are that you should treat them kindly with regard to their clothing and food.\\" Sunan Ibn Majah ¬ª The Chapters on Marriage accessed 22 May 2018 Conditions Islamic marriages require acceptance, in ', of the groom, the bride and the consent of the custodian (wali) of the bride. The wali of the bride is normally a male relative of the bride, preferably her father. The wali can only be a free Muslim, unless the bride is of the Christian or Jewish faith; in such cases the bride should be given away by someone from her religious background.The Encyclopaedia of Islam, New Edition, Vol. VIII, p. 27, Leiden 1995. The bride is normally present at the signing of the marriage contract. The Walƒ´ mujbir () is a technical term of Islamic law which denotes the guardian of a bride. In traditional Islam, the literal definition of \\"wali\\", which means \\"custodian\\" or \\"protector\\", is used. In this context, it is meant that the silence of the bride is considered consent. In most schools of Islamic law, only the father or the paternal grandfather of the bride can be wali mujbir. If the conditions are met and a mahr and contract are agreed upon, an Islamic marriage ceremony, or wedding, can take place. The marital contract is also often signed by the bride. The consent of the bride is mandatory. The Islamic marriage is then declared publicly, in i ølƒÅn (), by a responsible person after delivering a sermon to counsel and guide the couple. It is not required, though customary, that the person marrying the couple should be religiously well-founded in knowledge. The bridegroom can deliver the sermon himself in the presence of representatives of both sides if he is religiously educated, as the story goes about Imam Muhammad bin Ali around 829 AD . It is typically followed by a celebratory reception in line with the couple's or local customs, which could either last a couple of hours or precede the wedding and conclude several days after the ceremony. The Quran tells believers that even if they are poor they should marry to protect themselves from immoralityAmin Ahsan Islahi, Tadabbur-i Qur‚Äôan, vol. 5, 400.. The Quran asserts that marriage is a legitimate way to satisfy one's sexual desire. Islam recognizes the value of sex and companionship and advocates marriage as the foundation for families and channeling the fulfillment of a base need. Marriage is highly valued and regarded as being half of one's faith, according to a saying of Muhammad. Whether marriage is obligatory or merely allowed has been explored by several scholars, and agreed that \\"If a person has the means to marry and has no fear of mistreating his wife or of committing the unlawful if he does marry, then marriage in his case is mustahabb (preferred).\\" Prerequisites The Quran outlines some conditions for a marriage to take place: * A marriage should be conducted through a contract and a mandatory sum of wealth provided to the bride, which here refers to the mahr. Once a mahr has been ascertained with the realization that it is an obligation of a Muslim husband, the groom is required to pay it to the bride at the time of marriage unless he and his bride can mutually agree to delay the time of some of its payment. In 2003, Rubya Mehdi published an article in which the culture of mahr among Muslims was thoroughly reviewed. There is no concept of dowryIntroduction to Islam by Dr. Muhammed Hamidullah as such in Islam. A dowry as such is a payment to the groom from the bride's family, and is not an Islamic custom. Bride prices are also expressly prohibited. * Another requisite of marriage is chastity. No fornicator has the right to marry a chaste partner except if the two purify themselves of this sin by sincere repentance.Abu Da‚Äôud, Sunan, vol. 2, 227, (nos. 2051 -2052 ) * Marriage is permitted for a man with a chaste woman either Muslim or from the People of the Book (Arabic Ahl al Kitab, Jews, Sabians and Christians) but not to polytheists (or \\"idolaters\\": Yusuf Ali translation or \\"idolatresses\\": Pickthal translation). For women, marriage to Jews, Sabians and Christians and to polytheists (Idolatry) (or \\"idolaters\\": Yusufali translation or \\"disbelievers\\": Pickthall translation) is prohibited; they are only allowed to marry Muslims. There is no express prohibitionin the Quran or elsewhere about a Muslim woman marrying a People of the Book. However, the vast majority of Muslim jurists argued that since express permission was given to men, by implication women must be prohibited from doing the same. The movement of Islamic jurists and imams that do not agree on this interpretation is growing. * Spoken consent of the woman is only required if she is not a virgin and her wali is neither her father nor her paternal grandfather. But a virgin may not be married off without her permission. If she is too shy to express her opinion her silence will be considered as implicit agreement [Al Bukhari:6968].Muslim, Al-Jami' al-sahih, 596, (no. 3476) Binti Khudham says that when she became a widow her father solemnized her marriage. She did not like the decision so she went to Muhammad, who gave her permission to revoke her marriage. Al-Bukhari, Al-Jami‚Äò al-sahih, 919, (no. 5138) Hence, forced marriages are against Islamic teachings if the woman is a virgin, and those forced into marriages before they have come of age have the right to contest them once they do. * The importance of the wali is debated between the different schools of thought. To the Hanafi Sunnis, a male guardian is not required for the bride to become married, even if it is her first marriage. Therefore, the marriage contract is signed between the bride and the groom, not the groom and the wali. To the Hanbali, Shafi‚Äòi, and Maliki Sunni schools, a wali is required in order for a virginal woman to marry. In these schools, if a woman has been divorced, she becomes her own guardian and does not need a wali to sign a marriage contract. Rights and obligations of spouses According to Islam, both men and women have rights over each other when they enter into a marriage contract, with the husband serving as protector and supporter of the family most of the time, from his means. This guardianship has two aspects for both partners: * The husband is financially responsible for the welfare and maintenance of his wife or wives and any children they produce, to include at a minimum, providing a home, food and clothing. In return, it is the duty of the wife to safeguard the husband's possessions and protect how wealth is spent. If the wife has wealth in her own capacity she is not obliged to spend it upon the husband or children, as she can own property and assets in her own right, so the husband has no right for her property and assets except by her will. A pre-marital agreement of the financial expectation from the husband is in the mahr, given by him to the wife for her exclusive use, which is included as part of his financial responsibility. Several commentators have stated that the superiority of a husband over his wife is relative, and the obedience of the wife is also restrictive.Amin Ahsan Islahi, Tadabbur-i Qur'an, vol. 2, 291‚Äì292 Elaine Stokey writing in Scars Across Humanity: Understanding And Overcoming Violence Against Women, says \\"both the Quran and Hadiths contain passages which present women as the sexual property of men\\". Women are also reminded that in case the husband is not fulfilling his responsibilities, there is no stigma on them in seeking divorce. The Quran re-emphasizes that justice for the woman includes emotional support, and reminds men that there can be no taking back of the mahr or bridal gifts given to women, unless they are found guilty of sexual immorality . In unfortunate cases where the agreement was to postpone payment of the mahr, some husbands will bully their wives and insist on the return of what he gave her in order to agree to the dissolution of the marriage, this is un-Islamic and cruel. \\"Where the husband has been abusive or neglectful of his responsibilities, he does not have the right to take his wife's property in exchange for her freedom from him. Unfortunately most couples refuse to go to the judge and binding arbitration for these issues even though the Quran says: > \\"And if you fear a breach between them, then appoint an arbiter from his > folk and an arbiter from her folk. If they (the arbiters) desire > reconciliation, Allah will affect it between them. Surely, Allah is All- > Knowing, All-Aware.\\" Mahr, dowry and gifts Mahr (donatio propter nuptias) differs from a marriage dowry or gift, in that it is mandatory for a Muslim marriage and is paid by the groom to the bride. The amount of money or possessions of the mahr is paid by the groom to the bride at the time of marriage for her exclusive use.Kecia Ali, \\"Marriage in Classical Islamic Jurisprudence: A Survey of Doctrines\\", in The Islamic Marriage Contract: Case Studies in Islamic Family Law 11, 19 (Asifa Quraishi & Frank E. Vogel eds., 2008). The mahr does not have to be money, but it must have monetary value. Therefore, \\"it cannot be love, honesty, being faithful, etc., which are anyway traits of righteous people.\\" If the marriage contract fails to contain an exact, specified mahr, the husband must still pay the wife a judicially determined sum.PEARL & MENSKI, supra note 11, ¬∂ 7‚Äì16, at 180. Mahr is mentioned several times in the Quran and Hadith, and there is no maximum limit to the amount the groom may pay as mahr, but at a minimum it is an amount that would be sufficient for the woman to be able to survive independently if her husband dies or they divorce. With prior mutual agreement, the mahr may also be paid in parts to the bride with an amount given by the groom to the bride at the signing of the marriage contract, also called a mu'qadamm (in ), and the later portion postponed to a date during the marriage, also called a mu'akhaar (in ). Various Romanized transliterations of mu'qadamm and mu'akhaar are accepted. Such an agreement does not make the full amount of the mahr any less legally required, nor is the husband's obligation to fulfill the agreement waived or lessened while he fulfills his obligations to reasonably house, feed, or cloth the wife (and any children produced from the union) during the marriage.(PDF) The Islamic Institution of Mahr and American Law by Richard Freeland, Gonzaga University Quran [4:4] \\"You shall give the women their due dowries, equitably.\\" Quran [5:5] \\"Today, all good food is made lawful for you. The food of the people of the scripture is lawful for you. Also, you may marry the chaste women among the believers, as well as the chaste women among the followers of previous scripture, provided you pay them their due dowries. You shall maintain chastity, not committing adultery, nor taking secret lovers. Anyone who rejects faith, all his work will be in vain, and in the Hereafter he will be with the losers.\\" Quran [60:10] \\"O you who believe, when believing women (abandon the enemy and) ask for asylum with you, you shall test them. GOD is fully aware of their belief. Once you establish that they are believers, you shall not return them to the disbelievers. They are not lawful to remain married to them, nor shall the disbelievers be allowed to marry them. Give back the dowries that the disbelievers have paid. You commit no error by marrying them, so long as you pay them their due dowries. Do not keep disbelieving wives (if they wish to join the enemy). You may ask them for the dowry you had paid, and they may ask for what they paid. This is GOD's rule; He rules among you. GOD is Omniscient, Most Wise.\\" Marriage contracts and forced / un-consented marriages The Marriage contract is concluded between the wali (guardian) of the bride and the bridegroom and bride.The wali of the bride can only be a free Muslim. The wali of the bride is normally a male relative of the bride, preferably her father. If the bride is a virgin, the wali mujbir, that is her father or paternal grandfather, can not force the bride into the marriage against her proclaimed will; according to most scholars.

Permalink The notable example to this is the Hanafi school (the largest of the four classical schools of Islamic thought), which holds that a bride's permission is required if she has reached puberty. They also hold that if a bride was forced into marriage before reaching puberty, then upon attaining puberty she has the option to nullify the marriage if she wishes. A wali other than the father or the paternal grandfather of the bride, then called wali mukhtar, needs the consent of the bride according to the majority of scholars. If the bride is silent about the issue, i.e. her wali expressed his intention to marry her off to a certain man, and she did not object to it; then consent is assumed via her lack of objection.Encyclopaedia of Islam New Edition, Leiden 1995, tome 8, page 27 b, article NikƒÅ·∏•: \\"The wali can only give the bride in marriage with her consent, but in the case of a virgin, silent consent is sufficient. The father or the grandfather, however, has the right to marry his daughter or granddaughter against her will, as long as she is a virgin (he is therefore called wali mudjbir, wali with power to coercion); the exercise of this power is, however, very strictly regulated in the interests of the bride.\\" Abu Hurayrah reported that the Prophet said: \\"A non-virgin woman may not be married without her command, and a virgin may not be married without her permission; and it is permission enough for her is to remain silent (because of her natural shyness).\\" (Al-Bukhari:6455, Muslim & Others). It is reported in a Hadith that A'ishah related that she asked the Prophet : \\"In the case of a young girl whose parents marry her off, should her permission be sought or not?\\" He replied: \\"Yes, she must give her permission.\\" She then said: \\"But a virgin would be shy, O Messenger of Allaah!\\" He replied: \\"Her silence is [considered as] her permission.\\" (Al-Bukhari, Muslim, & Others) International human rights responses Children in some Muslim sub-cultures who defy their parents' wishes may in practice, suffer penalties supported by the community. International awareness, campaigns and organizations such as the U.K.'s Forced Marriage Unit have recognized the severity of this human rights issue and their rescue and support services extend beyond the borders of U.K. territories. Some countries have instituted prison time for parents who try to coerce their children into such unions. Divorce Divorce in Islam can take a variety of forms, some initiated by the husband and some initiated by the wife. The theory and practice of divorce in the Islamic world have varied according to time and place. Historically, the rules of divorce were governed by the Sharia, as interpreted by traditional Islamic jurisprudence, and they differed depending on the legal school. Historical practice sometimes diverged from legal theory. In modern times, as personal status (family) laws were codified, they generally remained \\"within the orbit of Islamic law\\", but control over the norms of divorce shifted from traditional jurists to the state. Prohibited marriages A bride signing the nikah nama (marriage certificate) In certain sections of the Jahiliyyah Arab tradition, the son could inherit his deceased father's other wives (i.e. not his own mother) as a wife. The Quran prohibited this practice. Marriage between people related in some way is subject to prohibitions based on three kinds of relationship. The following prohibitions are given from the male perspective for brevity; the analogous counterparts apply from the female perspective; e.g., for \\"aunt\\" read \\"uncle\\". The Quran states: Prohibitions based on consanguinity Seven relations are prohibited because of consanguinity, i.e. kinship or relationship by blood, viz. mothers, daughters, sisters, paternal aunts, maternal aunts and nieces (whether sister's or brother's daughters). In this case, no distinction is made between full and half relations, both being equally prohibited. Distinction is however made with step relations i.e. where both the biological mother and father of a couple wishing to marry are separate individuals for both parties, in which case it is permitted. The word \\"mother\\" also connotes the \\"father's mother\\" and \\"mother's mother\\" all the way up. Likewise the word \\"daughter\\" also includes the \\"son's daughter\\" and \\"daughter's daughter\\" all the way down. The sister of the maternal grandfather and of the paternal grandmother (great aunts) are also included on equal basis in the application of the directive. Prohibitions based on suckling Marriage to what are sometimes described as foster relations in English are not permitted, although the concept of \\"fosterage\\" is not the same as is implied by the English word. The relationship is that formed by suckling from the breast of a wet nurse. This is what is meant by \\"fosterage\\" in Islam in the quotation below. In Islam, the infant is regarded as having the same degree of affinity to the wet nurse as in consanguinity, so when the child grows up marriage is prohibited to those related to the wet nurse by the same degree as if to the child's own mother. A hadith (reports) confirm that fosterage does not happen by a chance suckling, it refers to the first two years of a child's life before it is weaned.Muslim, Al-Jami‚Äò al-sahih, 616, (no. 3590)Al-Bukhari, Al-Jami‚Äò al-sahih, 912 (no. 5102)Muslim, Al-Jami‚Äò al-sahih, 619, (no. 3606)\\"Every relationship which is prohibited (for marriage) owing to consanguinity is also prohibited owing to fosterage\\" Malik ibn Anas, Al-Mu‚Äôatta, 395-396, (no. 1887) Islahi writes that \\"this relationship is established only with the full intent of those involved. It only comes into being after it is planned and is well thought of\\".Amin Ahsan Islahi, Tadabbur-i Qur‚Äôan, vol. 2, 275. Prohibitions based on marriage The daughter-in-law is prohibited for the father, and the mother- in-law, the wife's daughter, the wife's sister and daughters of the wife's siblings (nieces), the maternal and paternal aunts of the wife are all prohibited for the husband. However, these are conditional prohibitions: # Only the daughter of that wife is prohibited with whom one has had conjugal contact. # Only the daughter-in-law of a real son is prohibited. # The sister of a wife, her maternal and paternal aunts and her brother's or sister's daughters (nieces) are only prohibited if the wife is in wedlock with the husband.Malik ibn Anas, Al-Mu‚Äôatta‚Äô, 341, (no. 1600) Prohibition based on religion The Quran states: *It is lawful for Muslim men to marry Jewish or Christian women but not a polytheist woman (Quran 5:5). Prohibited marriage partners * Marriage between people of the same sex * Marriage between a man and his sister, half-sister, foster sister, mother, stepmother, foster mother, wife's mother, aunt, grandmother, great aunt, great-grandmother, etc. * Marriage between a woman and her father, stepfather, husband's biological father, uncle, grandfather, great uncle, great-grandfather, etc. * Marriage of a man with women who are sisters or stepsisters or foster sisters of each other (except if marrying one who was separated from her husband by divorce or death) *Marriage of a man with women who are sisters or stepsisters or even cousins of his mother or father. Polygamy According to the Sharia (Law), Muslims are allowed to practice polygyny. According to the Quran, a man may have up to four legal wives only if there is a fear of being unjust to non- married orphan girls. Even then, the husband is required to treat all wives equally. If a man fears that he will not be able to meet these conditions then he is not allowed more than one wife. A bride-to-be may include terms in her marriage contract that require monogamy for her husband or require her consent before he marries another wife. Polyandry is forbidden. A woman cannot have more than one husband at a time. Sororal polygyny Sororal polygyny is forbidden. A man cannot marry: * two sisters * a woman and a descendant of her sibling * a woman and sibling of her ancestor Iddah A woman cannot marry after divorce or death of her husband for a certain period. This period is known as iddah. * A divorcee cannot marry for three menstrual cycles after divorce * A divorcee who has no courses cannot marry for three months * A pregnant woman cannot marry until laying her burden * A widow cannot remarry for four months and ten days Modern implementations In today's world, Muslims practice Islamic marital laws in a multitude of ways all over the globe. In the United States, for example, 95% of Muslim American couples included in a 2012 study by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding had completed both the Nikkah and had obtained a civil marriage license, which is required to have a marriage legally recognized in the United States. The study also shares that ‚ÄúIn some cases, the Islamic marriage contract is completed once the couple has decided to get married, but cohabitation occurs later after the wedding reception. In other cases, the Islamic marriage contract is completed simultaneously with the civil marriage and is followed immediately by the wedding reception.‚Äù There is ongoing debate about whether or not Sharia should be recognized in western countries like the United States and Australia that would allow for the Nikkah to be recognized as a legally valid marriage. There are also other elements to the Islamic marriage rituals that have difficulty being acknowledged in courts, according to the study, including the Mahr, or the dowry. Women who are denied their dowry do not have a clear path to legal contestation in either the US or Canada. Studies have also shown that even young Muslim Americans who might describe themselves as \\"not very religious embrace the rituals of their faith at important moments of transition ‚Äì birth, death and marriage. These occasions motivate reaffirmation of emotional and behavioral touchstones, even for those who do not practice their faith by attending mosque, praying or fasting regularly.\\" When it comes to divorce, the 2014 study conducted by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding states that, \\"Two divorce rates commonly cited for American Muslims include 32.33% and 21.3%, respectively.\\" Within the United States and Canada, many Muslim couples interviewed in the study mention that they value a religious divorce and its proceedings. Some turn to religious figures to help them navigate the divorce process, while many still go through the courts to terminate the civil marriage. Divorced Muslim women today also face the stigmas associated with being divorced within the North American Muslim community that can make it difficult for them seek remarriage. Gender roles and ideas about marriage have also shifted since the early onset of Islam when many of the rules around marriage were established. ISPU reports that \\"the most frequent source of marital conflict in this study was conflict over changing gender roles and expectations,\\" citing a nation-wide increase in women in higher education and professional jobs over the past three decades, and, ‚ÄúIn many cases are trying to integrate childrearing and family life with professional goals‚Äù. In March 2017, Salamet Memetimin, an ethnic Uyghur and the communist party secretary for Chaka township‚Äôs Bekchan village in Qira County, Hotan Prefecture, Xinjiang, China, was relieved of her duties for taking her nikah marriage vows at her home. In interviews with Radio Free Asia in 2020, residents and officials of Shufu County (Kona Sheher), Kashgar Prefecture (Kashi) stated that it was no longer possible to perform traditional Uyghur nikah marriage rites in the county.

While Megalon is of limited intelligence (he must be led to his destination by the protagonists' robot, Jet Jaguar), he makes up for it with his strength. Megalon possess two drill-like front appendages, which it uses both for burrowing and as weapons, and a set of wings usually covered by a beetle-like shell. The creature can fly, burrow, and swim at high speeds. Unlike most kaiju under fire from humans who prevail with brute force, Megalon uses retreat and ambush tactics to defeat human forces in his first encounter. Megalon also has a horn (similar to a rhinoceros beetle) from which it can fire lightning-like bolts of electricity and it is capable of spitting fire bombs from its mouth. In Godzilla vs. Megalon, Megalon is worshipped as a deity by the people of the subterranean kingdom known as Seatopia. The Seatopians unleash Megalon on the surface world as revenge for the damage caused to Seatopia through reckless nuclear testing.

The policy was enacted by the Tokugawa shogunate under Tokugawa Iemitsu through a number of edicts and policies from 1633 to 1639, and ended after 1853 when the American Black Ships commanded by Matthew Perry forced the opening of Japan to American (and, by extension, Western) trade through a series of treaties. It was preceded by a period of largely unrestricted trade and widespread piracy. Japanese mariners and merchants travelled Asia, sometimes forming Nihonmachi communities in certain cities, while official embassies and envoys visited Asian states, New Spain (since the early 19th century Mexico), and Europe. This period was also noted for the large number of foreign traders and pirates who were resident in Japan and active in Japanese waters. The term sakoku originates from the manuscript work written by Japanese astronomer and translator Shizuki Tadao in 1801. Shizuki invented the word while translating the works of the 17th-century German traveller Engelbert Kaempfer concerning Japan. Japan was not completely isolated under the sakoku policy. Sakoku was a system in which strict regulations were placed on commerce and foreign relations by the shogunate and certain feudal domains (han). There was extensive trade with China through the port of Nagasaki, in the far west of Japan, with a residential area for the Chinese. The policy stated that the only European influence permitted was the Dutch factory at Dejima in Nagasaki. Western scientific, technical and medical innovations did flow into Japan through Rangaku (\\"Dutch learning\\"). Trade with Korea was limited to the Tsushima Domain (today part of Nagasaki Prefecture). Trade with the Ainu people was limited to the Matsumae Domain in Hokkaid≈ç, and trade with the Ry≈´ky≈´ Kingdom took place in Satsuma Domain (present-day Kagoshima Prefecture). Apart from these direct commercial contacts in peripheral provinces, trading countries sent regular missions to the sh≈çgun in Edo and Osaka Castle.  Trade under sakoku  Japan traded at this time with five entities, through four \\"gateways\\". The largest was the private Chinese trade at Nagasaki (who also traded with the Ry≈´ky≈´ Kingdom), where the Dutch East India Company was also permitted to operate. The Matsumae clan domain in Hokkaid≈ç (then called Ezo) traded with the Ainu people. Through the S≈ç clan daimy≈ç of Tsushima, there were relations with Joseon-dynasty Korea. Ry≈´ky≈´, a semi-independent kingdom for nearly all of the Edo period, was controlled by the Shimazu clan daimy≈ç of Satsuma Domain. Tashiro Kazui has shown that trade between Japan and these entities was divided into two kinds: Group A in which he places China and the Dutch, \\"whose relations fell under the direct jurisdiction of the Bakufu at Nagasaki\\" and Group B, represented by the Korean Kingdom and the Ry≈´ky≈´ Kingdom, \\"who dealt with Tsushima (the S≈ç clan) and Satsuma (the Shimazu clan) domains respectively\\".Tashiro, Kazui. \\"Foreign Relations During the Edo Period: Sakoku Reexamined\\". Journal of Japanese Studies. Vol. 8, No. 2, Summer 1982. Many items traded from Japan to Korea and the Ry≈´ky≈´ Kingdom were eventually shipped on to China. In the Ry≈´ky≈´ Islands and Korea, the clans in charge of trade built trading towns outside Japanese territory where commerce actually took place.Toby, Ronald (1984). State and Diplomacy in Early Modern Japan. Princeton: Princeton University Press. Due to the necessity for Japanese subjects to travel to and from these trading posts, this resembled something of an outgoing trade, with Japanese subjects making regular contact with foreign traders in essentially extraterritorial land. Commerce with Chinese and Dutch traders in Nagasaki took place on an island called Dejima, separated from the city by a narrow strait; foreigners could not enter Nagasaki from Dejima, nor could Japanese enter Dejima without special permission or authorization. For the island's inhabitants, conditions on Dejima were humiliating; the police of Nagasaki could harass them at will, and at all times a strong Japanese guard was stationed on the narrow bridge to the mainland in order to prevent them from leaving the island. Walworth, Arthur. Black Ships Off Japan. New York, NY, 1946. pp 5-6  Terminology  Trade in fact prospered during this period, and though relations and trade were restricted to certain ports, the country was far from closed. In fact, even as the shogunate expelled the Portuguese, they simultaneously engaged in discussions with Dutch and Korean representatives to ensure that the overall volume of trade did not suffer. Thus, it has become increasingly common in scholarship in recent decades to refer to the foreign relations policy of the period not as sakoku, implying a totally secluded, isolated, and \\"closed\\" country, but by the term kaikin (Êµ∑Á¶Å, \\"maritime prohibitions\\") used in documents at the time, and derived from the similar Chinese concept haijin.Toby, Ronald (1977). \\"Reopening the Question of Sakoku: Diplomacy in the Legitimation of the Tokugawa Bakufu\\", Journal of Japanese Studies. Seattle: Society for Japanese Studies.  Rationale  It is conventionally regarded that the shogunate imposed and enforced the sakoku policy in order to remove the colonial and religious influence of primarily Spain and Portugal, which were perceived as posing a threat to the stability of the shogunate and to peace in the archipelago. The increasing number of Catholic converts in southern Japan (mainly Ky≈´sh≈´) was a significant element of that which was seen as a threat. Based on work conducted by Japanese historians in the 1970s, some scholars have challenged this view, believing it to be only a partial explanation of political reality. The motivations for the gradual strengthening of the maritime prohibitions during the early 17th century should be considered within the context of the Tokugawa bakufu's domestic agenda. One element of this agenda was to acquire sufficient control over Japan's foreign policy so as not only to guarantee social peace, but also to maintain Tokugawa supremacy over the other powerful lords in the country, particularly the tozama daimy≈çs. These daimy≈çs had used East Asian trading linkages to profitable effect during the Sengoku period, which allowed them to build up their military strength as well. By restricting the daimy≈çs ability to trade with foreign ships coming to Japan or pursue trade opportunities overseas, the Tokugawa bakufu could ensure none would become powerful enough to challenge the bakufu's supremacy. This is consistent with the generally agreed rationale for the Tokugawa bakufu's implementation of the system of alternate attendance, or sankin-k≈çtai. Directing trade predominantly through Nagasaki, which came under Toyotomi Hideyoshi's control in 1587, would enable the bakufu, through taxes and levies, to bolster its own treasury. This was no small matter, as lack of wealth had limited both the preceding Kamakura bakufu and the Muromachi bakufu in crucial ways. The focus on the removal of Western and Christian influence from the Japanese archipelago as the main driver of the kaikin could be argued to be a somewhat eurocentric reading of Japanese history, although it is a common perception. Nevertheless, Christianity and the two colonial powers it was most strongly associated with were seen as genuine threats by the Tokugawa bakufu. Once the remnants of the Toyotomi clan had been defeated in 1615, Tokugawa Hidetada turned his attention to the sole remaining credible challenge to Tokugawa supremacy. Religious challenges to central authority were taken seriously by the bakufu as ecclesiastical challenges by armed Buddhist monks were common during the sengoku period. The Empress Meish≈ç (1624‚Äì96) also had grave doubts when she heard about how the Spanish and Portuguese were settling in the New World, and thought that Japan would soon become one of the many countries in their possession. Buddhist statue with hidden cross on back, used by Christians in Japan to hide their real beliefs. Protestant English and Dutch traders reinforced this perception by accusing the Spanish and Portuguese missionaries of spreading the religion systematically, as part of a claimed policy of culturally dominating and colonizing Asian countries. The Dutch and English were generally seen by the Japanese to be able to separate religion and trade, while their Iberian counterparts were looked upon with much suspicion. The Dutch, eager to take over trade from the Spanish and Portuguese, had no problems reinforcing this view. The number of Christians in Japan had been steadily rising due to the efforts of missionaries, such as Francis Xavier and daimy≈ç converts. The direct trigger which is said to have spurred the imposition of sakoku was the Shimabara Rebellion of 1637‚Äì38, an uprising of 40,000 mostly Christian peasants. In the aftermath, the shogunate accused missionaries of instigating the rebellion, expelled them from the country, and strictly banned the religion on penalty of death. The remaining Japanese Christians, mostly in Nagasaki, formed underground communities and came to be called Kakure Kirishitan. All contact with the outside world became strictly regulated by the shogunate, or by the domains (Tsushima, Matsumae, and Satsuma) assigned to the task. Dutch traders were permitted to continue commerce in Japan only by agreeing not to engage in missionary activities. Today, the Christian percentage of the population (1%) in Japan remains far lower than in other East Asian countries such as China (3%), Vietnam (7%), South Korea (29%). Beacon on Taketomi, one of the Sakishima Beacons constructed in 1644 to monitor foreign shipping The sakoku policy was also a way of controlling commerce between Japan and other nations, as well as asserting its new place in the East Asian hierarchy. The Tokugawa had set out to create their own small-scale international system where Japan could continue to access the trade in essential commodities such as medicines, and gain access to essential intelligence about happenings in China, while avoiding having to agree to a subordinate status within the Chinese tributary system. Japan's generally constructive official diplomatic relationship with Joseon Korea allowed regular embassies (Tongsinsa) to be dispatched by Korea to Japan. Together with the brisk trade between Tsushima and Korea, as well as the presence of Japanese in Pusan, Japan was able to access Chinese cultural, intellectual and technological developments throughout the Edo period. At the time of the promulgation of the strictest versions of the maritime prohibitions, the Ming dynasty had lost control of much of China and it was unnecessary, and perhaps undesirable, for Japan to pursue official diplomatic relations with either of the Ming or the Qing governments while the issue of imperial legitimacy was unsettled. Japan was able to acquire the imported goods it required through intermediary trade with the Dutch and through the Ryukyu Islands. The Japanese actually encouraged the Ry≈´ky≈´ Kingdom's rulers to maintain a tributary relationship with China, even though the Shimazu clan had surreptitiously established great political influence in the Ryukyu Islands. The Qing became much more open to trade after it had defeated the Ming loyalists in Taiwan, and thus Japan's rulers felt even less need to establish official relations with China. Liberalizing challenges to sakoku did come from within Japan's elite in the 18th century, but they came to nothing.Hall, J (1955). Tanuma Okitsugu, 1719‚Äì1788, p. 105. Later on, the sakoku policy was the main safeguard against the total depletion of Japanese mineral resources‚Äîsuch as silver and copper‚Äîto the outside world. However, while silver exportation through Nagasaki was controlled by the shogunate to the point of stopping all exportation, the exportation of silver through Korea continued in relatively high quantities. The way Japan kept abreast of Western technology during this period was by studying medical and other texts in the Dutch language obtained through Dejima. This developed into a blossoming field in the late 18th century which was known as Rangaku (Dutch studies). It became obsolete after the country was opened and the sakoku policy collapsed. Thereafter, many Japanese students (e.g., Kikuchi Dairoku) were sent to study in foreign countries, and many foreign employees were employed in Japan (see o-yatoi gaikokujin). The policies associated with sakoku ended with the Convention of Kanagawa in response to demands made by Commodore Perry. Challenges to seclusion Many isolated attempts to end Japan's seclusion were made by expanding Western powers during the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. American, Russian and French ships all attempted to engage in a relationship with Japan but were rejected. *In 1647 Portuguese warships attempted to enter Nagasaki. The Japanese formed a blockade of almost 900 boats to stop the ships. After the event, the Japanese added more security to Nagasaki as fears rose that other countries would challenge the new seclusion policy and attempt to enter through Nagasaki.Cullen, L.M. A History of Japan, 1582‚Äì1941. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003. p. 39 *In 1738, a Russian naval squadron (including Martin Spangberg) visited the island of Honshu. The Russians landed in a scenic area which is now part of the Rikuchu Kaigan National Park. Despite the prevalent seclusion policy, the sailors were treated with politeness if not friendliness.Glynn Barratt. Russia in Pacific Waters, 1715‚Äì1825. UBC Press, 1981. . Pages 35‚Äì37. *In 1778, a merchant from Yakutsk by the name of Pavel Lebedev-Lastochkin arrived in Hokkaid≈ç with a small expedition. He offered gifts, and politely asked to trade in vain. *In 1787, Jean-Fran√ßois de Galaup, comte de Lap√©rouse navigated in Japanese waters. He visited the Ry≈´ky≈´ islands and the strait between Hokkaid≈ç and Sakhalin, naming it after himself. *In 1791, two American ships commanded by the American explorer John Kendrick‚Äîthe Lady Washington,Islands and empires: Western impact on the Pacific and east Asia by Ernest Stanley Dodge p.302 under Captain Kendrick, and the Grace, under Captain William Douglas‚Äîstopped for 11 days on Kii ≈åshima island, south of the Kii Peninsula. Kendrick was the first known American to have visited Japan. He apparently planted an American flag and claimed the islands, although only one English-language account of the voyage exists.Logbook for Brig ‚ÄúGrace‚Äù (1791). The Duxbury Rural & Historical Society. *In 1792 the Russian subject Adam Laxman visited the island of Hokkaido. *From 1797 to 1809, several American ships traded in Nagasaki under the Dutch flag, upon the request of the Dutch who were not able to send their own ships because of their conflict against Britain during the Napoleonic Wars:K. Jack Bauer, A Maritime History of the United States: The Role of America's Seas and Waterways, University of South Carolina Press, 1988., p. 57 ** In 1797 US Captain William Robert Stewart, commissioned by the Dutch from Batavia, took the ship Eliza of New York to Nagasaki, Japan, with a cargo of Dutch trade goods. ** In 1803, William Robert Stewart returned on board a ship named \\"The Emperor of Japan\\" (the captured and renamed \\"Eliza of New York\\"), entered Nagasaki harbour and tried in vain to trade through the Dutch enclave of Dejima. ** Another American captain John Derby of Salem, Massachusetts aboard the Margaret, tried in vain to open Japan to the opium trade. *In 1804, the Russian expedition around the world led by captain Adam Johann von Krusenstern reached Nagasaki. The Russian envoy Nikolai Rezanov requested trade exchanges. The Bakufu refused the request and the ships had to leave in spring 1805. The Russians attacked Sakhalin and the Kuril islands during the following three years, prompting the Bakufu to build up defences in Ezo. * In 1808, the British frigate HMS Phaeton, preying on Dutch shipping in the Pacific, sailed into Nagasaki under a Dutch flag, demanding and obtaining supplies by force of arms. * In 1811, the Russian naval lieutenant Vasily Golovnin landed on Kunashiri Island, and was arrested by the Bakufu and imprisoned for 2 years. *In 1825, following a proposal by (È´òÊ©ãÊôØ‰øù)), the shogunate issued an \\"Order to Drive Away Foreign Ships\\" (Ikokusen uchiharairei, also known as the \\"Ninen nashi\\", or \\"No second thought\\" law), ordering coastal authorities to arrest or kill foreigners coming ashore. *In 1830, the brig \\"Cyprus\\", a ship of British convicts (destined for colonies in what would become Australia) who had successfully mutinied against their masters and set sail for Canton, China, arrived on the coast of Shikoku near the town of Mugi in Tokushima Prefecture. The mutineers were desperately low on water, firewood, and supplies, but were attacked and sent away by the Japanese. This was the first time a ship ever visited Japan from what are now Australian waters. *Also in 1830, the Bonin Islands, claimed by Japan but uninhabited, were settled by the American Nathaniel Savory, who landed on the island of Chichijima and formed the first colony there.Asia Society of Japan, Long lecture . * In 1837, an American businessman in Canton (Guangzhou) named Charles W. King saw an opportunity to open trade by trying to return to Japan three Japanese sailors (among them, Otokichi) who had been shipwrecked a few years before on the coast of Oregon. He went to Uraga Channel with Morrison, an unarmed American merchant ship. The ship was fired upon several times, and finally sailed back unsuccessfully. *In 1842, following the news of the defeat of China in the Opium War and internal criticism following the Morrison Incident, the Bakufu responded favourably to foreign demands for the right to refuel in Japan by suspending the order to execute foreigners and adopting the \\"Order for the Provision of Firewood and Water\\" ( (Ëñ™Ê∞¥Áµ¶‰∏é‰ª§). *In 1844, a French naval expedition under Captain Fornier-Duplan visited Okinawa on April 28, 1844. Trade was denied, but Father Forcade was left behind with a translator. *In 1845, whaling ship Manhattan (1843) rescued 22 Japanese shipwrecked sailors. Captain Mercator Cooper was allowed into Edo Bay, where he stayed for four days and met with the Governor of Edo and several high officers representing The Emperor. They were given several presents and allowed to leave unmolested, but told never to return. * On July 20, 1846, Commander James Biddle, sent by the United States Government to open trade, anchored in Tokyo Bay with two ships, including one warship armed with 72 cannons, but his demands for a trade agreement remained unsuccessful. * On July 24, 1846, the French Admiral C√©cille arrived in Nagasaki, but failed in his negotiations and was denied landing. He was accompanied by two priests who had learnt the Japanese language in Okinawa: Father Forcade and Father Ko.Polak 2001, p. 19 *In 1848, Half-Scottish/Half-Chinook Ranald MacDonald pretended to be shipwrecked on the island of Rishiri in order to gain access to Japan. He was sent to Nagasaki, where he stayed for 10 months and became the first English teacher in Japan. Upon his return to America, MacDonald made a written declaration to the United States Congress, explaining that the Japanese society was well policed, and the Japanese people well behaved and of the highest standard. * In 1848, Captain James Glynn sailed to Nagasaki, leading at last to the first successful negotiation by an American with \\"Closed Country\\" Japan. James Glynn recommended to the United States Congress that negotiations to open Japan should be backed up by a demonstration of force, thus paving the way to Perry's expedition. * In 1849, the Royal Navy's HMS Mariner entered Uraga Harbour to conduct a topographical survey. Onboard was the Japanese castaway Otokichi, who acted as a translator. To avoid problems with the Japanese authorities, he disguised himself as Chinese, and said that he had learned Japanese from his father, allegedly a businessman who had worked in relation with Nagasaki. * In 1853, the Russian embassy of Yevfimy Putyatin arrived in Nagasaki (August 12, 1853). The embassy demonstrated a steam engine, which led to the first recorded attempts at manufacturing a steam engine in Japan, by Hisashige Tanaka in 1853. These largely unsuccessful attempts continued until, on July 8, 1853, Commodore Matthew Perry of the U.S. Navy with four warships: Mississippi, Plymouth, Saratoga, and Susquehanna steamed into the Bay of Edo (Tokyo) and displayed the threatening power of his ships' Paixhans guns. He demanded that Japan open to trade with the West. These ships became known as the kurofune, the Black Ships. End of isolationism Commodore Perry's fleet for his second visit to Japan in 1854. The following year, at the Convention of Kanagawa (March 31, 1854), Perry returned with seven ships and forced the Shogun to sign the \\"Treaty of Peace and Amity\\", establishing formal diplomatic relations between Japan and the United States. The United Kingdom signed the Anglo-Japanese Friendship Treaty at the end of 1854. Between 1852 and 1855, Admiral Yevfimiy Putyatin of the Russian Navy made several attempts to obtain from the Shogun favourable trade terms for Russia. In June 1853, he brought to Nagasaki Bay a letter from the Foreign Minister Karl Nesselrode and demonstrated to Tanaka Hisashige a steam engine, probably the first ever seen in Japan. His efforts culminated in the signing of the Treaty of Shimoda in February 1855. Within five years, Japan had signed similar treaties with other western countries. The Harris Treaty was signed with the United States on July 29, 1858. These \\"Ansei Treaties\\" were widely regarded by Japanese intellectuals as unequal, having been forced on Japan through gunboat diplomacy, and as a sign of the West's desire to incorporate Japan into the imperialism that had been taking hold of the continent. Among other measures, they gave the Western nations unequivocal control of tariffs on imports and the right of extraterritoriality to all their visiting nationals. They would remain a sticking point in Japan's relations with the West up to the turn of the 20th century. Missions to the West Nadar. Several missions were sent abroad by the Bakufu, in order to learn about Western civilization, revise treaties, and delay the opening of cities and harbour to foreign trade. A Japanese Embassy to the United States was sent in 1860, on board the Kanrin Maru. In 1861 in the Tsushima Incident a Russian fleet tried to force open a harbour not officially opened to foreign trade with foreign countries, but was finally repelled with the help of the British. An Embassy to Europe was sent in 1862, and a Second Embassy to Europe in 1863. Japan also sent a delegation and participated to the 1867 World Fair in Paris. Other missions, distinct from those of the Shogunate, were also sent to Europe, such as the Ch≈çsh≈´ Five, and missions by the fief of Satsuma.

Description  The First Apocalypse of James is regarded as part of the New Testament apocrypha. It was first discovered amongst 52 other Gnostic Christian texts spread over 13 codices by an Arab peasant, Mohammad Ali al- Samman, in the Egyptian town of Nag Hammadi late in December 1945. Another copy has more recently been found in the Codex Tchacos, where it is merely titled 'James'. Those texts were in the Coptic language. In 2017, the first Greek copy was found (the work was originally written in Greek) amongst unpublished Oxyrhynchus Papyri housed at Oxford University. The Nag Hammadi Coptic manuscript is remarkably well preserved for its age; it was reported that the cache of texts called the \\"Nag Hammadi library\\", when originally found, were sealed within a large terra cotta vessel. They were secreted during the fourth century, in an effort to hide the texts from destruction by others.Markschies, Christoph (trans. John Bowden), (2000). Gnosis: An Introduction. T & T Clark. See details at Nag Hammadi library. The form of the text is primarily that of a Revelation Dialogue/Discourse between James the brother of Jesus (James the Just) and Jesus, with a rather fragmentary account of the departure (possibly meaning martyrdom) of James appended to the bottom of the manuscript, connected to the remainder by an oblique reference to crucifixion. The first portion of the text describes James' understandable concern about being crucified, whereas the latter portion describes secret \\"passwords\\" given to James so that he can ascend to the highest heaven (out of 72) after dying, without being blocked by evil \\"powers\\" of the demiurge. In the text, Jesus tells James, \\"you are not my brother materially.\\"The text begins \\"It is the Lord who spoke with me: \\"See now the completion of my redemption. I have given you a sign of these things, James, my brother. For not without reason have I called you my brother, although you are not my brother materially.\\" Some of the framing background details about James given in the text are thought by academics to reflect early traditions; according to the text: * James was the head of the early church. * James was the most senior apostle. The first-known Greek copy of the text was discovered in 2017 at Oxford University by Geoffrey Smith and Brent Landau, religious studies scholars at the University of Texas at Austin. The fragments date from the fifth or sixth century and were probably a teacher's model used to help students learn to read and write. The fragments will be published in the Oxyrhynchus compilation The Greco-Roman Memoirs. One of the most curious features of the First Apocalypse of James is that the range of dating of its original text, assigned to it by scholars, requires that it was written after the Second Apocalypse of James.

The population of the Burnage Ward at the 2011 census was 15,227. It lies between Withington to the west, Levenshulme to the north, Heaton Chapel to the east and Didsbury and Heaton Mersey to the south. History=Toponymy The name Burnage is thought to have stemmed from \\"Brown Hedge\\", from the old brown stone walls or \\"hedges\\" which were common there in medieval times. In a survey of 1320, the district is referred to as \\"Bronadge\\". Middle Ages During the Middle Ages, Burnage was an area of common pasture and marsh land. Burnage did not have its own manor but the land was shared between the farmers from the Manors of Withington and Heaton Norris as it was a border district between two neighbouring lordships. A survey of 1320 records 356 acres of common pasture land under the Manor of Heaton. As the population began to expand, the land was reclaimed for arable land. In a survey of 1322, the Lord of Manchester was permitted to appropriate more land for arable use, provided he left enough common pasture land for the commoners to graze their animals. Named arable farmers of this time included Thomas Grelley, Sir John de Byron, Sir John de Longford and Dame Joan de Longford, who farmed 136 acres of land subject to the Lord of Manchester. There are records of a sale of land, which refer to \\"that moiety of the place called Burnage lying next to Heaton\\", when John La Warre and his wife Joan granted 100 acres of moor and pasture in Heaton and Withington to a Thomas de Trafford. The Withington land belonging to the de Longford family later passed to the Mosley family and subsequently to the Egerton family. Because the Mosleys were former Lords of the Manor of Withington, the Mosley family's heraldic crest was used as the crest of Withington. A carved Mosley crest can still be seen above the door of the old Withington Town Hall (1881) on Lapwing Lane in West Didsbury. In recognition of the connection with the Withington Manor, the Mosley crest was also adopted in the 20th century as the badge of Burnage High School. 17th‚Äî19th centuries By 1655, Burnage had become a township. The Egerton family were major landowners in Burnage; in 1798, the politician William Egerton was recorded as the largest contributor to the land tax, paying over a third, and by 1844, William's eldest son and heir Wilbraham Egerton owned about half of the land in Burnage. In 1894, the Irish writer George Bernard Shaw described Burnage as the prettiest village in Manchester.\\"Looking back at Levenshulme and Burnage\\" Willow Publishing 1987 , page 8. Burnage had an established cottage industry in hand weaving. Many of the original weavers' cottages survive today. 20th century A tram running along Kingsway, c.1930 An example of council housing on Elmhurst Drive, Burnage 1906 saw plans to build a \\"garden suburb\\" in the district. Burnage Garden Village was created by building many new semi-detached houses as well as open recreational spaces, including lawns, gardens, a bowling green, tennis courts, allotments and a children's playground. Hans Renold established an engineering works at Burnage from 1906 to manufacture roller chain. The factory closed during the late 1980s. The site lay abandoned for several years, but now has been developed and a Tesco supermarket and a development of flats and retail units sit on the site. Construction of Kingsway (the A34) began in 1928. It was named after King George V and was originally numbered A5079. Like Princess Road further to the west, Kingsway was laid out as a dual carriageway for motor vehicles with a segregated tram track along the central reservation which allowed Manchester Corporation Tramways to run trams into Manchester City Centre. A large housing estate was built by Manchester City Council along the Kingsway route, mostly characterised by brick semi-detached houses laid out in avenues and octagons. Today, only parts of Burnage Lane still survive as original weavers' cottages. A cinema, the Lido, was built in the 1920s on Kingsway. This was renamed the Odeon in the 1940s and then became the Classic in the 1960s, before finally becoming the Concorde cinema in the 1970s which then also included a bingo hall in the premises. The cinema closed in the early 1990s, and has since been demolished and a supermarket built on the site.Cinema Treasures (Burnage Concorde) Mauldeth Hall in Green End was the dwelling of the Bishop of Manchester for more than 20 years, before his move to Higher Broughton. ;Aviation On 28 April 1910, French pilot Louis Paulhan landed his Farman biplane in Barcicroft Fields, Pytha Fold Farm, on the borders of Withington, Burnage and Didsbury. This completed the first ever powered flight from London to Manchester, with a short overnight stop at Lichfield, (195 miles/298 km), and he won a ¬£10,000 prize offered by the Daily Mail, beating the British contender, Claude Grahame-White. Two special trains were chartered to Burnage railway station to take spectators to the landing, with other spectators waiting through the previous night. Paulhan was followed throughout by a train carrying his wife, Henri Farman and his supporting mechanics. Today, a blue plaque recording Paulhan's achievement is displayed on a house in Paulhan Road, which forms part of the site where he landed. ;Babies' Hospital The Duchess of York Hospital for Babies in 1953 In 1919 the Manchester Babies Hospital moved to Cringle Hall in Burnage having previously been in Levenshulme and Chorlton-on-Medlock. It then had 50 beds; the number of patients increased from 82 in the first year to 430 in 1929. After the building of a new pavilion on the open-air principle with glass wards specially designed for the treatment of rickets in 1925 the number of cots rose to 80. In 1935 a new hospital wing with much improved surgical facilities was opened by the Duchess of York in June 1935. The name of the hospital was changed to the Duchess of York Hospital for Babies. Until the creation of the National health Service in 1948 the hospital was supported by the Corporation of Manchester and by voluntary contributions. It closed in 1986 and a new Duchess of York ward was then opened in Withington Hospital.Mohr, Peter D. \\"Dr Catherine Chisholm (1879‚Äì1952)\\", in: Manchester Memoirs; vol. 140 (2001‚Äì02), pp. 21‚Äì30The Book of Manchester and Salford.

Geography Burnage is a suburb of South Manchester, approximately from Manchester City Centre Governance Burnage electoral ward within the City of Manchester Civic history Burnage was a township in the ancient parish of Manchester in the Salford Hundred of Lancashire (historic boundaries). In the early 13th century it lay within the Manor of Withington, a feudal estate which also encompassed the townships of Withington, Didsbury, Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Moss Side, Rusholme, Denton and Haughton, ruled by the Hathersage, Longford, Mosley and Tatton families. Burnage remained under the manor of Withington for several centuries. Burnage was in Chorlton Poor Law Union (together with most of south Manchester but named after Chorlton-on-Medlock) from 1837 to 1915, and in Manchester Poor Law Union from 1915 to 1930. In 1876 it was included in the area of Withington Local Board of Health. Under the Divided Parishes Act 1882 there was an exchange of areas with Withington township and part of Didsbury township was added to Burnage township. In 1894 it became part of Withington Urban District in the administrative county of Lancashire. In 1904 it became part of the City of Manchester, which later in 1974 became a metropolitan borough within the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester. Political representation The current city councillors for the ward are Azra Ali (Labour), Ben Clay (Labour) and Bev Craig (Labour). Burnage is one of seven Manchester City Council wards in the parliamentary constituency of Manchester Withington, currently represented by Jeff Smith MP (Labour).

He was 29 years old when he was elected mayor in 2003, the youngest mayor in Windsor's history and one of the youngest mayors ever elected in Canada. He is also Windsor's first Lebanese-Canadian mayor. Background Francis was born in Windsor to Lebanese Maronite Catholic parents who had recently immigrated to Canada from Lebanon. He speaks fluent English and Arabic. Francis is an alumnus of Notre Dame Elementary School and Holy Names Catholic High School, both in Windsor. While in high school, Francis was a major contributor to student life while participating in the student council, and held the office of student body president. He holds a combined honour's degree in chemistry and biochemistry from the University of Western Ontario. He graduated from the University of Windsor Law School and was called to the Bar in 2002.City of Windsor: Biography of the Mayor Prior to entering politics, Francis ran and operated Royal Pita Baking Company with his brothers. Under their stewardship the \\"mom and pop\\" operation's distribution quickly expanded to other markets, including London, Ontario, Toronto and 12 U.S. states.\\"A region's hard road to renewal\\" , Canadian Business, January 8, 2007. In 2003, he was awarded the Windsor Chamber of Commerce Business Excellence Award as the Young Entrepreneur of the Year for his work with Royal Pita. Councillor Francis was first elected to Windsor City Council in a by-election in June 1999, following the resignation of Rick Limoges. He became the youngest city councillor in Windsor's history, beating a record previously held by Limoges, when he was chosen to represent Ward 5 (Riverside / Forest Glade) at the age of 25. Shortly after being elected to city council, Francis enrolled in the University of Windsor Law School. He graduated in 2002 and articled with the international law firm of Miller Canfield Paddock and Stone. Subsequently, Francis was called to the Bar of the Law Society of Upper Canada. In the November 2000 general election, Francis was re-elected to his Ward 5 seat with the largest majority ever recorded in a Windsor municipal election. As an active member of city council, Francis was involved in many of the city's major committees, agencies and boards. He held the positions of director of Windsor Canada Utilities, member of the Detroit‚ÄìWindsor Tunnel Commission, chair of the Windsor Licensing Commission and chair of the International Relations Committee. Mayoralty Francis was first elected mayor in the 2003 municipal election, winning narrowly over fellow councillor Bill Marra. One of his first acts as mayor was to join the planning committee for the 2006 Super Bowl festivities in Detroit, ensuring that Windsor would receive some of the economic benefits of participating in a major tourist event. He was subsequently re-elected in the 2006 election, garnering 77.56 per cent of the votes cast in the mayoral race, for which 38.2 per cent of registered voters cast a ballot. He won again in the 2010 election, with 56.17% of the vote. During Francis' mayoralty, Windsor has consistently reduced municipal debt and passed six consecutive budgets with zero tax increases.\\"Across the river from bankrupt Detroit, Windsor boasts five years without a tax hike\\". National Post, December 3, 2013. Francis announced in March 2014 that he will not run for a fourth term as mayor, and will instead take a job as executive vice- president of the Windsor Family Credit Union beginning on December 1, 2014.\\"Francis sets summer deadline to finish job; Mayor to start with WFCU Dec. 1\\". Windsor Star, March 27, 2014. Waterfront marina On July 29, 2008, Francis announced one of the most ambitious projects of his mayoral term, a waterfront redevelopment proposal which would transform a struggling section of downtown Windsor into a waterfront park by converting the block bounded by Crawford, Caron and University Avenues ‚Äî an area which currently consists primarily of parking lots and a disused section of railway track ‚Äî into an inland marina cut back from the Detroit River, and converting either Chatham Street or Pitt Street into a canal and adjoining boardwalk, which would extend easterly for three blocks from the marina to a spot near the Art Gallery of Windsor, and then from there back to the river at the eastern edge of Dieppe Park. He appointed Dave Cooke, a former Member of Provincial Parliament, to chair a feasibility study on the proposal. On August 19, councillor Alan Halberstadt criticized Francis for allegedly being secretive about the plan, and in response Cooke was brought in to speak to city council about the plan on September 2. The project was never commissioned, lacking public support and funding. Relationship with Detroit during the Kilpatrick crisis On August 7, 2008, Detroit mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, already in the midst of pending felony charges, was jailed for violating his bail conditions after travelling to Windsor on July 23 for a meeting with Francis regarding a proposed deal pertaining to the Detroit‚ÄìWindsor Tunnel, which would have seen the city of Windsor take over operational control of the tunnel in exchange for a $75 million loan to the cash-strapped city of Detroit. Kilpatrick stated that Francis had requested the meeting on short notice, while Francis and other city bureaucrats indicated that the meeting had in fact been at Kilpatrick's request. The meeting resulted in a 14-month investigation by Windsor's Integrity Commissioner, Earl Basse, who cleared Francis of wrongdoing in his relationship with Kilpatrick. Francis later stated that he was confident that Kilpatrick's resignation on September 4 would not threaten the tunnel deal, indicating that he also had a strong working relationship with Kilpatrick's successor, Ken Cockrel. However, Cockrel himself indicated that he would prefer to renegotiate an alternate agreement to maintain joint management of the tunnel between the two cities. Following Detroit's July 2013 bankruptcy filing, Francis said that his city would consider purchasing Detroit's half of the Detroit‚ÄìWindsor Tunnel if it was offered for sale.

The Butler Medal, also known as the Colored Troops Medal, was a military decoration of a unit of the United States Army which were issued in 1865. The medal was commissioned by Major General Benjamin Butler and was intended to recognize meritorious or heroic acts of bravery performed by African American soldiers at the Battle of Chaffin's Farm and New Market Heights. Fourteen African Americans had earned the Medal of Honor in that engagement, but Butler wished to further recognize his African American troops involved in the battle, and he paid for the Butler Medals out of his personal funds. In May 1865, and later that year, the Butler Medal was presented to nearly two hundred African American Union soldiers. The medal was originally known as the Colored Troops Medal, but the name was changed to Butler Medal after the close of the Civil War. The Butler Medal was solid silver, suspended from a red, white, and blue ribbon meant to be worn around the neck. Attached to the ribbon was a wreath reading \\"Army of the James\\".

Originally built for the Soviet Navy, it was one of the biggest and most important surface combatants of the Russian Navy. It is similar in displacement to a World War I battleship. Although commissioned as a missile cruiser, Kirovs size and weapons complement have given her the unofficial designation of a battlecruiser throughout much of the world. The appearance of the Kirov class was a significant factor in the U.S. Navy recommissioning the . She was named after a Project 26 cruiser (named after Sergey Kirov, a Bolshevik hero). History She was laid down on 27 March 1974, at the Baltiysky Naval Shipyard in Leningrad, launched on 26 December 1977, and commissioned on 30 December 1980, part of Soviet Northern Fleet. When she appeared for the first time in 1981, NATO observers called her BALCOM I (Baltic Combatant I). Her first long voyage was in 1984 to the Mediterranean Sea. Heavy cruiser's second and final long voyage happened between December 1, 1989 - February 17, 1990 in the Mediterranean Sea. During the deployment, she suffered a reactor malfunction. Afterwards, she was placed in reserve.http://nvo.ng.ru/armament/2009-09-25/8_kreiser.html For political reasons, Kirov was renamed Admiral Ushakov after the 18th-century admiral Fyodor Fyodorovich Ushakov in 1992, but subsequent photos suggest that it has since reverted to its original name. An overhaul was started in 1999, but the ship was written off in 2001 and was slated to be dismantled in 2003. In 2010, the Russian navy again announced new plans for an overhaul of the cruiser. At the time, the plan was to modify and reactivate all of the Kirov battlecruisers by 2020. However, in 2012 it was reported that Admiral Ushakov and Admiral Lazarev would not be overhauled due to being in a state of \\"beyond repair\\". Armament This ship had an armament of missiles and guns as well as electronics. Its largest radar antenna is mounted on its foremast and called \\"Top Pair\\" by NATO. Kirovs main weapons are 20 P-700 Granit (SS-N-19 Shipwreck) missiles mounted on deck, designed to engage large surface targets, and air defense is provided for with 12 S-300F (SA-N-6) launchers with 96 missiles, two Osa-M (SA-N-4 Gecko) with 40 missiles and the Kashtan CIWS air- defence missile/gun system. Other weapons are the automatic 130 mm AK-130 gun system, 30 mm AK-630, 10 torpedo/missile tubes, Udav-1 (SS-N-14 Silex) with 40 anti-submarine missiles and the two RBU-1000 six-tube launchers. Fate Admiral Ushakov at Severomorsk in 1992 Kirov suffered a reactor accident in 1990 while serving in the Mediterranean Sea. Repairs were never carried out, due to lack of funds and the changing political situation in the Soviet Union. She may have been cannibalized as a spare-parts cache for the other ships in her class. In June 2004, the name Admiral Ushakov was transferred to the . In September 2004, it was revealed that the Severodvinsk-based Design Bureau Onega had been tasked with developing the dismantlement project for the cruiser, currently moored at the Severodvinsk Zvezdochka plant. According to the Zvezdochka plant, dismantlement of the former Admiral Ushakov would cost $40 million. This plan was halted when the Russian navy planned to bring her back to service. This now seems unlikely and Zvezdochka shipyard CEO Vladimir Nikitin foresees dangers removing the spent nuclear fuel from the vessel's two reactors, it having never been moved or changed in 34 years. In April 2019, Russia decided to scrap and recycle the Admiral Ushakov in 2021. In popular culture * In the film Threads, Kirov collides with in the Persian Gulf.

It was used every year on Ascension Day up to 1798 to take the doge out to the Adriatic Sea to perform the \\"Marriage of the Sea\\" ‚Äì a ceremony that symbolically wedded Venice to the sea every year on the \\"Festa della Sensa\\" (Ascension Day). Scholars believe there were four major barges, the first significant bucentaur having been built in 1311. The last and most magnificent of the historic bucentaurs made its maiden voyage in 1729 in the reign of Doge Alvise III Sebastiano Mocenigo. Depicted in paintings by Canaletto and Francesco Guardi, the ship was long and more than high. A two-deck floating palace, its main salon had a seating capacity of 90. The doge's throne was in the stern, and the prow bore a figurehead representing Justice with sword and scales. The barge was propelled by 168 oarsmen, and another 40 sailors were required to man it. The ship was destroyed in 1798 on Napoleon's orders to symbolize his victory in conquering Venice. In February 2008, the Fondazione Bucintoro announced a ‚Ç¨20 million project to rebuild the 1729 bucentaur. Work started on 15 March 2008 at the Arsenale shipyard and naval dock. Origin of the name The origin of the name bucintoro is obscure, but one possibility is that it is derived from the Venetian burcio, a traditional term for a lagoon vessel, and in oro, meaning covered in gold.. On the other hand, man of letters Francesco Sansovino (1521‚Äì1586) proposed, based on documents dating from 1293, that it was named after an earlier boat built at the Arsenale shipyard called the Navilium Duecentorum Hominum (Of Two Hundred Naval Men). It has also been suggested that the vessel was named after the ship Centaurus referred to by Virgil when describing the funeral rites observed by Aeneas to honour his father's death; the bucentaur was twice the size of the ship mentioned in the Aeneid. The name may also refer to trumpets and horns that were played on board.. The term bucintoro was Latinized in the Middle Ages as bucentaurus on the analogy of an alleged Greek word Œ≤ŒøœÖŒ∫Œ≠ŒΩœÑŒ±œÖœÅŒøœÇ (boukentauros) meaning \\"ox-centaur\\", from Œ≤ŒøœÖœÇ (bous, \\"ox\\") and Œ∫Œ≠ŒΩœÑŒ±œÖœÅŒøœÇ (kentauros, \\"centaur\\"). The common supposition was that the name derived from a creature of a man with the head of an ox, a figure of which served as the barge's figurehead.. This derivation is, however, fanciful; the word Œ≤ŒøœÖŒ∫Œ≠ŒΩœÑŒ±œÖœÅŒøœÇ is unknown in Greek mythology, and representations of the \\"figurehead\\" of the bucentaurs in fact depict the lion of St. Mark the Evangelist.. The name \\"bucentaur\\" seems, indeed, to have been given to any great and sumptuous Venetian vessels. Du Cange quotes from the chronicle of the Doge Andrea Dandolo (reigned 1343‚Äì1354): \\"... cum uno artificioso et solemni Bucentauro, super quo venit usque ad S. Clementem, quo jam pervenerat principalior et solemnior Bucentaurus cum consiliariis, &c; [... with a well- wrought and stately Bucentaur, upon which he came to San Clemente, where a more important and more stately Bucentaur had already arrived with his advisors, etc. ...]\\". The earliest known depiction of a bucentaur, from Jacopo de' Barbari's Pianta di Venezia (Map of Venice, 1500) The term was also used to describe a 16th-century sumptuous transport boat, built and decorated in Modena, to celebrate the marriage of Lucrezia, the daughter of Ercole II d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, to the Duke of Urbino. The vessels Before the age of the bucentaurs, it is probable that for ceremonies in the Venetian Lagoon the doge was simply assigned a small galley from the Venetian fleet. As Venice's wealth increased due to its naval power, plans were made for a special ship to be built. This is evidenced by the promissioni ‚Äì sacramental pledges spoken by the doges when they were sworn into office ‚Äì of Reniero Zeno of 1252, Lorenzo Tiepolo of 1268 and Giovanni Soranzo of 1312 which mention the construction of a bucentaur in the Arsenale shipyard and naval depot., a translation of an extract from . The 1311 bucentaur Historians agree that four major barges were built. While there are believed to have been earlier vessels, the bucentaur of 1311 is regarded as the first significant one, for on 17 August 1311 the promissione was amended to add the statement \\"quod Bucentaurus Domini ducis fiat per Dominium et teneatur in Arsenatu\\" (\\"... that a Bucentaur should be made for the Lord Doge for his rule, and it should be held in the Arsenale\\"). This was the first time that Venetian law had provided that the expense of building the bucentaur was to be borne by the public budget. The two-decked bucentaur had a tiemo (canopy) with two sections, one in purple velvet for the doge, the other in red velvet for Venetian nobles. The historian Marino Sanuto the Younger, in his work De origine, situ et magistratibus urbis Venetae (On the Origin, Site and Officials of the City of Venice), also described the ship as bearing a sculpture of Justice. (Italian). The bucentaur was used not only for the Marriage of the Sea ceremony, but also for other state functions such as festivals celebrating the Virgin Mary and the bearing of newly crowned dogaressas (the wives of doges) to the Doge's Palace. On 6 May 1401, a law was passed to prohibit the doge from making private use of the bucentaur. (Italian). Documents mention the construction of another bucentaur in 1449 larger than the 1311 one, but little is known about this vessel. The earliest known image of a bucentaur appeared in Jacopo de' Barbari's monumental woodcut Pianta di Venezia (Map of Venice) which was published in 1500. This work pictured a bucentaur afloat in the Arsenale without oars or decoration save for a large wooden sculpture of Justice in the bow. A similar illustration was produced by Andrea Valvassore between 1517 and 1525. The 1526 bucentaur On 10 May 1526, Marino Sanuto the Younger recorded that on \\"Ascension Day the serenissimo [the Most Serene One ‚Äì the doge] went in the new bucintoro to wed the sea\\", adding that \\"it was a beautiful work, larger and wider than the other one\\". The proportions and rich decoration of this Bucentaur, built in the reign of Doge Andrea Gritti, became the model for successive versions of the ship. It had two decks and 42 oars, and was adorned with figures of lions with a sculpture of Justice at the prow (preserved in the Museum of Naval History in Venice). The movable canopy of the vessel was covered with red fabric on the outside, and blue fabric with gold stars inside. (Italian). This bucentaur was frequently referred to in Venetian chronicles. It was on the ship that in July 1574 Henry III of France was conveyed with the doge down the Grand Canal to the Ca' Foscari where he stayed during his visit to Venice. The ship was also used to transport the newly crowned Dogaressa Morosina Morosini- Grimani to the Doge's Palace on 4 May 1597. This event was the subject of numerous etchings and paintings by Giacomo Franco, Andrea Vicentino, Sebastian Vrancx and anonymous artists.McManus, History of the Bucentaurs , states that the event took place on 4 May 1497. This appears to be an error, as the Dogaressa Morosina Morosini-Grimani lived from 1545 to 21 January 1614, and was crowned official consort in 1597 after her husband Marino Grimani's election as doge in 1595. Sebastian Vrancx's Trionfo sul Bucintoro in Bacino San Marco di Morosina Morosini Grimani (The Triumphal Entry of Morosina Morosini-Grimani on the Bucentaur into St. Mark's Basin, 17th century) The 1606 bucentaur A bucentaur, from the Folger Shakespeare Library's copy of Giacomo Franco's Habiti d'hvomeni et donne venetiane (Dress of Venetian Men and Ladies, 1609?) (Italian) (see also the frontispiece and pp. 14, 26, 32, 44, 84 and 118 of the book). Despite Venice's economic and maritime decline, in 1601 at the behest of the Doge Marino Grimani, (Italian). the Venetian Senate decided to have a new bucentaur built at the cost of 70,000 ducats; although the existing one was still in service, experts regarded it as too old. The designer of the new ship is unknown, but he was selected from among the most qualified marangoni (ships' carpenters) of the Arsenale. The work was supervised by Marco Antonio Memmo, the sovraprovveditore (overseer of the provveditore) of the Arsenale. The new vessel was approved and praised by all on its maiden voyage to the Lido with the newly elected Doge Leonardo Donato on Ascension Day, 10 May 1606. The third barge was modelled after its predecessors, its decorations influenced by late-Renaissance forms. Contemporary illustrations show that the sides of the bucentaur were covered by mythical figures of sirens riding seahorses, and that the loggias were supported by curved dolphins amongst intertwined garlands and scrollwork taking on the form of monstrous hydras extending from the ends of the two bow spurs. It was once believed that most of the wooden sculptures, including a large sculpture of Mars, two lions of St. Mark positioned on either side of the stern, and the figurehead of Justice (dressed in apparel made by the San Daniele Monastery), were the work of the renowned Venetian sculptor Alessandro Vittoria, but research has revealed the names of the brothers Agostino and Marcantonio Vanini of Bassano who were praised as \\"authors of carvings of marvellous beauty\\". After more than a century of service, in 1719 a decision was made to demolish the ship. A model of the bucentaur's figurehead in the Museum of Naval History in Venice The 1727 bucentaur The last and most magnificent of the historic bucentaurs was commissioned by the Senate in 1719, (Italian). and the construction of it began in the Arsenale in 1722. The ship was designed by Michele Stefano Conti,Not to be confused with the Stefano Conti who was a patron of Canaletto, who painted the bucentaur on several occasions: see . the protomagistro dei marangoni (head master of the ships' carpenters). Wooden sculpting work was assigned to Antonio Corradini, as was testified by the phrase \\"Antonii Coradini sculptoris Inventum\\" (\\"invention of the sculptor Antonio Corradini\\") inscribed near the bow palmette. He was an established sculptor, having already worked on commissions in Austria, Bohemia and Saxony. The gilding, in pure gold leaf, was handled by one Zuanne D'Adamo. Some of the 1606 ship's ornaments and sculptures, including the sculpture of Mars and the two lions of St. Mark, were salvaged and reused. The vessel was long and more than high. A two-deck floating palace, its main salon was covered in red velvet, had 48 windows set in a huge, elaborately carved baldacchino or canopy, and had a seating capacity of 90. The doge's throne was in the stern, and the prow bore the traditional figurehead representing Justice with sword and scales. The barge was propelled by 168 oarsmen rowing in teams of four on its 42 oars each in length; another 40 sailors were required to man it. Only the most handsome and sturdy youths of the Arsenale were selected for the ship's crew. The new bucentaur made its d√©but on Ascension Day 1729 in the reign of Doge Alvise III Sebastiano Mocenigo. The event was officially recorded, and the splendour of the vessel praised with sonnets and publications such as that by Antonio Maria Lucchini entitled La Nuova regia su l'acque nel Bucintoro nuovamente eretto all'annua solenne funzione del giorno dell'Ascensione di Nostro Signore (The New Palace upon the Waters of the Newly Built Bucentaur at the Annual Solemn Function of the Day of the Ascension of Our Lord, 1751). (Italian). An extract from the work appears as (Italian). The German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, in his work Italienischen Reise (Italian Journey, 1816‚Äì1817) which was an account of his travels in Italy between 1786 and 1787, described the bucentaur on 5 October 1786 in these terms: In 1798, Napoleon ordered this bucentaur to be destroyed, less for the sake of its golden decorations than as a political gesture to symbolize his victory in conquering the city.. French soldiers broke up the carved wooden portions and the gold decorations of the ship into small pieces, carted them to the island of San Giorgio Maggiore and set fire to them to recover the gold. The ship burned for three days, and French soldiers used 400 mules to carry away its gold. The decorative elements of the vessel that survived the flames are preserved in the Museo Civico Correr in Venice, and there is a detailed scale model of the vessel in the Arsenale. The hull survived and, renamed the Prama Hydra and armed with four cannons, was stationed at the mouth of the Lido's port where it served as a coastal battery. Subsequently, the ship was returned to the Arsenale and used as a prison ship.. until it was entirely destroyed in 1824. Marriage of the Sea ceremony The Return of the Bucentaur to the Molo on Ascension Day (1730) by Canaletto The \\"Marriage of the Adriatic\\", or more correctly \\"Marriage of the Sea\\" (in Italian, Sposalizio del Mare), was a ceremony symbolizing the maritime dominion of Venice. The ceremony, established about 1000 to commemorate the Doge Pietro II Orseolo's conquest of Dalmatia, was originally one of supplication and placation, Ascension Day being chosen as that on which the doge set out on his expedition. The form it took was a solemn procession of boats, headed by the doge's nave (ship), from 1311 the Bucentaur, out to sea by the Lido port. Modern reconstruction In February 2008, plans to rebuild the bucentaur destroyed in 1798 were announced. More than 200 shipbuilders, woodcarvers and jewellers started work on 15 March 2008 at the Arsenale. It has been reported by the Italian press that it will take two years for the bucentaur to be constructed. However, Colonel Giorgio Paterno, the head of Fondazione Bucintoro which is behind the ‚Ç¨20 million project, said in March 2008 that \\"[w]e'll build it as fast as we can but we're not in a hurry.\\" It is intended that the project will make use of traditional shipbuilding techniques and original materials, including larch and fir wood, and will reproduce gold decorations. The foundation is supported by businessmen in the Veneto and Lombardy regions but has also written to the French President Nicolas Sarkozy for France to make a financial contribution as a goodwill gesture to compensate for Napoleon's \\"vandalism\\" of the 1729 vessel. Fondazione Bucintoro hopes that the vessel will become \\"the most visited floating museum in the world\\", but also sees the project as a means to \\"help Venice recover its former glory and its old spirit\\".

The original decoration was known as the Kearny Medal and was adopted as an unofficial medal by the officers of the 1st Division, 3rd Corps, of the Union Army of the Potomac, which had served under Major General Philip Kearny. The original Kearny Medal was first bestowed on November 29, 1862, and was awarded to any Union officer who had performed acts of extreme bravery and heroism in the face of the enemy. It was created by Black, Starr & Frost in 1863. In 1863, the medal was authorized retroactively to officers who had performed such acts while enlisted soldiers, and had been subsequently commissioned. On March 13, 1863, a second version of the Kearny Medal was ordered established as a \\"Cross of Valor\\" for enlisted personnel. The new medal, known as the Kearny Cross, was awarded to any Union soldier who had displayed meritorious, heroic, of distinguished acts while in the face of an enemy force. By 1865, both the Kearny Medal and the Kearny Cross were commonly referred to by the single name of the Kearny Cross. Since the decorations were issued by local commanders, the medals remained unofficial awards and were not issued after the close of the Civil War. Nevertheless, the Kearny Cross and Medal are regarded as one of the oldest military decorations of the United States Army, second only to the Badge of Military Merit and the Fidelity Medallion. Women awarded the cross General Birney awarded Mrs. Anna Etheridge with this award; a nurse and vivandiere born either on May 3, 1839, or May 3, 1844. Also known as \\"Gentle Annie\\", she received the award for her bravery. Marie Tepe, (1834-1901) also known as \\"French Mary\\", a famous vivandiere of the Civil War, was one of at least three women who served during the battle of Gettysburg, the other well documented example being a currently unidentifiable woman, whose body was found amongst the many Confederate dead after Pickett's Charge. While serving under the 114th Pennsylvania Volunteers, also known as the Collis' Zouaves d'Afrique, she received the award for being wounded in the ankle. She was in 13 battles, and carried a .44 caliber pistol. Charlotte Elizabeth McKay received the Kearney Cross from the officers of the 17th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment, whom she had cared for after the Battle of Chancellorsville.

Roots and early life King grew up in a small two-room flat in Beggars Bush, Dublin tenement that had once been part of Beggars Bush Barracks. When he was around the age of six or seven his parents bought him a guitar. King remembers being called inside by his mother to watch David Bowie perform \\"Starman\\" on television, which he cites as one of many influences along with Luke Kelly, Joe Strummer, Johnny Cash, and Freddie Mercury to name a few. King's father died when he was 10 years old. He left Dublin in his twenties, briefly residing in London and then on to Los Angeles where he first joined Fastway and later formed Flogging Molly with Ted Hutt, Jeff Peters, and Bridget Regan.Friction magazine, by George B. Sanchez, 5 November 2002 After emigrating to the United States, he was without a \\"green card\\" for eight years. King was not able to visit his home or family in Ireland during this time for fear that immigration laws would prevent his return to the United States. This separation from his homeland and his mother is thought to be a contributing factor in many of Flogging Molly's early song lyrics, with many of the songs alluding to King's time in \\"exile\\". Career King's professional career began in the early 1980s when he was hired as the vocalist for Fastway, an English hard rock band formed by ex-Mot√∂rhead guitarist \\"Fast\\" Eddie Clarke and ex-UFO) bassist Pete Way in 1983. They recorded their first four records with King on vocals, as well as a live record. When Fastway was ostensibly disbanded (Eddie carried on the name with all new members), King formed Katmandu with Mandy Meyer (former member of the band Krokus) and Mike Alonso, (former member of the Detroit- based band Speedball), who released one self-titled album. The band had a couple of minor hits but later disbanded. King retained a record deal with Epic records, who wanted him to sing for Jeff Beck, but he declined. He started working with forming the band Flogging Molly, with new material that had a distinct Irish sound, but still retaining the hard driving, loud and fast musical style. He asked to be let out of his Epic contract because \\"they wouldn't know what to do with the new music anyways...\\" Since then, Flogging Molly has reached position No. 4 on the Billboard charts top 200 and a No. 1 on the Billboard Indie Chart. Personal life King is married to fellow musician and bandmate Bridget Regan. After years together, the two married in a private ceremony in Tokyo, Japan while on tour in 2008.

At the end of the Mexican War in 1848, Wood returned to Ohio and saw service in the newly acquired California territory during the gold rush. After serving at sea on Ohio for three years, Wood's ship returned to Boston where he was given a three-month leave of absence. During his time aboard Ohio, Zachary Taylor had become president. Wood served for a time aboard Ohio alongside William Hall and later supported Hall's US Navy pension claim.States, David W. \\"William Hall VC of Horton Bluff, Nova Scotia Nineteenth Century Naval Hero\\", Collections of the Royal Nova Scotia Historical Society Vol. 44, Suppression of African slave trade Wood served at sea during the last part of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, performing shore duty as a Naval Academy officer. During the last part of the war he sailed off the coast of Africa suppressing the African slave trade and in the Mediterranean. He served aboard patrolling in the Gulf of Guinea when it captured a Spanish slave ship. His first command of a ship occurred when he was ordered to bring the captured Africans to Liberia and set them free. He was responsible for his ship, his crew, and three hundred and fifty prisoners. The voyage lasted three weeks and was pitted against stormy seas but Wood succeeded in reaching Monrovia with his ship and passengers intact. The authorities in Liberia denied Wood the right to land his human cargo in the capital and he was forced on another one hundred and fifty mile voyage to Grand Bassa. Once again Wood was confronted by governmental authorities and was told he could not land his cargo of captured and would be slaves. However, this time he did not comply, asserted his authority, and landed his human cargo. Wood returned to Porpoise and at age 21 had gained confidence as a commander from the experience.Bell, 2002, p.18 Other service Wood graduated second in his class from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1852. He then went on to serve on on voyage about the Mediterranean which last two years. Cumberland was a ship that he would later fight against as a Confederate officer in the American Civil War. After returning to Annapolis, Maryland in September 1855, he received promotion to lieutenant. Wood returned to Maryland and met Lola Mackubin, daughter of a prominent Maryland politician. They were married on November 26, 1856. Their daughter, Anne, was born on September 18, 1857. In 1858 he served as a gunnery officer for eighteen months aboard . During this time, he suffered the loss of his infant daughter in 1859. Civil War Lieutenant Wood taught gunnery tactics at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, at the beginning of the Civil War. Due to his southern sympathies, he resigned his commission on April 2, 1861, and took up farming nearby. He later went to Virginia and in October 1861, received a commission as a Confederate Navy first lieutenant, where he was appointed as officer in the Confederate States Navy by October and assigned to in November.Field, 2011, p. 35 Following service with shore batteries on the Potomac River,Bell, 2002, p.22 he became an officer in the newly converted ironclad CSS Virginia serving under Commander Buchanan. He was wounded in the Battle of Hampton Roads. Wood commanded the stern pivot gun during the battle and fired the shot that seriously wounded Lieutenant John Lorimer Worden, captain of Monitor.Field, 2011, pp. 35, 37 In May 1862, after Virginia was destroyed, Wood assisted with the defense of Drewry's Bluff, on the James River. During the next two years, Wood led several successful raids against Federal ships and also served as naval aide to Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Promoted to commander in May 1863, he simultaneously held the rank of colonel in the cavalry. These dual ranks, with his reputation for extraordinary daring and his family connections to Confederate leaders, allowed him to play an important liaison role between the South's army, navy and civil government. In August 1864, Wood commanded , a Confederate commerce raider and blockade runner against U.S. shipping off the Atlantic coast, capturing an astonishing 33 Union ships during a ten-day period off the coast of New England.Symonds, 2009, p.84Bell, 2002, pp.62, 67Tucker, 2006, p.293 He received the rank of captain in February 1865. A few months later, as the Confederacy was disintegrating, he accompanied President Davis in his attempt to evade capture and leave the country. Though briefly taken prisoner, Wood escaped to Cuba. He subsequently went to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he became a businessman. His wife and family joined him there, and they lived the rest of their lives in Nova Scotia. Wood died there on July 19, 1904. His obituary appeared in the New York Times the next day. He is buried in Halifax's Camp Hill Cemetery.Bell, 2002, p.64  Legacy  * Tallahassee Avenue, Tallahassee Elementary School, and Taylorwood Lane in Eastern Passage are named for Wood and his ship. * Halifax Street Names; An Illustrated Guide. p. 148  See also  * Bibliography of American Civil War naval history * Military history of Nova Scotia * Canada in the American Civil War ReferencesBibliography * , Book (par view) * , Book (par view) * , Book (par view) , Book (no view) * , Book (par view) * Url Other sources * Further reading * , Book *U.S. Naval Historical Center External links Biography at the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online * Photographs of John Taylor Wood's tombstone, Halifax, Nova Scotia 1830 births 1904 deaths American emigrants to pre-Confederation Nova Scotia Canadian people of the American Civil War Confederate States Navy captains Confederate States Army officers Military history of Nova Scotia Northern-born Confederates People from Fort Snelling, Minnesota United States Naval Academy alumni United States Navy officers Zachary Taylor family ","title":"John Taylor Wood"},{"id":"1356854","text":"Dharwad, is a city located in the north western part of the Indian state of Karnataka. It is the headquarters of the Dharwad district of Karnataka and forms a contiguous urban area with the city of Hubballi. It was merged with Hubballi in 1962 to form the twin cities of Hubballi-Dharwad. It covers an area of 213 km¬≤ and is located 430 km northwest of Bangalore, on NH-48, between Bangalore and Pune.  History  The Chalukyas ruled Dharwad during the 12th century. A stone inscription indicates that there was a ruler by the name of BhaskaraDeva in 1117. In the 14th century, the district was first overrun by the Bahmani Sultanate, after which it was annexed to the newly established Hindu kingdom of Vijayanagar, an official of which named Dhar Rao, according to local tradition, built the fort at Dharwad town in 1403. After the defeat of the king of Vijayanagar at Talikot (1565), Dharwad was for a few years practically independent under its Hindu governor; but in 1573 the fort was captured by the sultan of Bijapur, Adil Shah, and Dharwad was annexed to his dominions. Adil Shah built a fort in an area later called Manna Killa, and later Nazratabad. With this fort, the strategic importance of Dharwad increased and it attracted the attention of subsequent conquerors, including Aurangzeb, Shivaji, Aurangzeb's son Muhammad Muazzam known as Bahadur Shah I or Shah Alam, the seventh Mughal emperor (1707-1712), Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao, Hyder Ali, Tipu Sultan and finally the British colonizers. In 1685, the fort was taken by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, and Dharwad, on the break-up of the Mughal empire, fell under the sway of the Maratha Peshwa of Pune. In 1764, the province was overrun by Hyder Ali of the Mysore, who in 1778 captured the fort of Dharwad. The fort was retaken in 1791 by the Marathas. After the final defeat of the Peshwa by the British in 1818, Dharwar was incorporated into the territory of the British East India Company's Bombay Presidency. During the early 19th century, when the British were expanding their domains, they faced a lot of opposition from local rulers, including Baba Saheb of Naragund and Kittur Chennamma. Dharwad was independent before 1947.  Geography = Climate  Hubli-Dharwad has a tropical wet and dry climate. Summers are hot and dry, lasting from late February to early June. They are followed by the monsoon season, with moderate temperatures and a large amount of precipitation. Temperatures are fairly moderate from late October to early February, with virtually no rainfall. Hubli is 750 meters above sea level. The average yearly rainfall is 838 mm. Demographics The population of the twin cities as per provisional figures of Census 2011 is 943,857 and is urban. Hubli-Dharwad's population increased 22.99% between 1981 and 1991, from 527,108 to 648,298, and by 21.2% between 1991 and 2001. The Hubli-Dharwad municipality covers 213 sq. km.  Economy  Hubballi is one of the commercial hubs of Karnataka. It is the fourth largest city in terms of economy after Bangalore, Mangalore & Mysore. It has a wide cluster of industries and has more than a 100,000 small and medium industries. The Government of India set up a Software Technology Park of India on Pune‚ÄìBengaluru Road and Aryabhata Tech Park in the Navanagar region of Hubballi. The city is situated on the dividing line between Malnad and the Deccan plateau. Malnad is well known for its forests and forest-based industries and the other surrounding areas for agricultural products comprising cotton, groundnut, other oil seeds, etc., as well as manganese ore and granite. The establishment in 1880 of a new-generation diesel locomotive shed in the city by the Indian Railways was another major boost for development of industries in this region, as it was the first of its kind in the history of the Indian Railways. The diesel locomotive shed at Hubballi is even today the largest holder of EMD locomotives in India.http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/uploads/directorate/mec_engg/downloads/DLS/swr/Brief%20history%20of%20the%20shed- UBL.pdf  Civic administration  Hubli-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) was constituted in 1962 by combining two cities separated by a distance of 20 kilometers. The area covered by the corporation is 213 km¬≤. spread over 45 revenue villages. The population of the city as per the 1991 census was 7 lakhs. The population of Hubli-Dharwad is 943,857 according to 2011 Census.There has been a huge demand by people of Dharwad to create a separate civic body and get itself detached by HDMC.Claims are that most of the funds are allocated to Hubli solely. *Hubli: Under the Government of India Act of 1850, the Hubli-Municipal council was established on 15 August 1855. *Dharwad: The Dharwad Municipal Council first came into existence on 1 January 1856. The first non-official President of the Council was S.K. Rodda in 1907, and Shri S.V. Mensinkai, was nominated in the following year. But the credit of being the first elected President goes to Shri S.G. Karigudari, who took office in 1920. Hubli is well known as a commercial as well as industrial centre, whereas Dharwad is seat of learning. Popularly believed that, it is this diversity and geographical positions that the state government amalgamated the two cities.The twin-city corporation occupies unique place in Karnataka State. After the capital city of Bangalore, this is the largest city Corporation in the State.  Economy = Industrial and business development  Hubli- Dharwad is a developing industrial hub in Karnataka after Bangalore & Mangalore, with more than 1000 allied small and medium industries established in Gokul Road and Tarihal regions of Hubli. There are machine tools industries, electrical, steel furniture, food products, rubber and leather industries, and tanning industries. To promote the overall economic development of industries, institutions and businesses, the Karnataka Chamber of Commerce & Industry was formed. It is one of the premier associations, which has been gaining momentum in achieving potential growth and prosperity in Hubli region. One key aspect of industrialisation for Hubballi-Dharwad was foundation of Agricultural Produce Market Committee, which aimed at providing hassle-free market conditions for farmers, to establish regulated and stimulated production of agricultural related commodities and goods.

He also served as Minister for Industrial Relations, Minister for Transport and Communications and Minister for Finance. He represented the Victorian seat of Gellibrand in the House of Representatives from 1972 to 1998. Early life Willis was born in Melbourne to Stan and Doris Willis and educated at Footscray Central School, University High School and Melbourne University, gaining a Bachelor of Commerce. He subsequently worked as a research officer and industrial advocate for the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) during the time that Bob Hawke was ACTU President. He and his wife Carol Willis (n√©e Dawson) have three children, Sandra, Fiona and Evan. Political career In 1972, the year that the Whitlam Government was elected, Willis was elected to the House of Representatives for the safe Labor seat of Gellibrand in Melbourne's western suburbs. After Labor's defeat at the 1975 election, Willis was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet, serving initially as Shadow Minister for Industrial Relations, and from 1980 as Shadow Treasurer. In January 1983, however, he was replaced as Shadow Treasurer by Opposition Leader Bill Hayden, who gave the position to Paul Keating in an unsuccessful attempt to shore up his own position as party leader.Bill Hayden (1996), Hayden: An autobiography, Angus & Robertson, Sydney. Hawke Government As a former ACTU official, Willis was regarded as a prot√©g√© of Bob Hawke, and some expected Hawke to make him Treasurer upon his election as Prime Minister in March 1983. However Hawke decided to appoint Paul Keating to the role instead, making Willis the Minister for Employment Relations and giving him a major role in establishing and overseeing the Prices and Incomes Accord, one of the central policy reforms of the Hawke Government. Willis retained this role following the 1984 and 1987 elections, before being appointed Minister for Transport and Communications in 1988. After the 1990 election, Willis became Minister for Finance. Following Keating's resignation as Treasurer in June 1991 in an unsuccessful attempt to challenge Hawke for the leadership, there was media speculation that Willis would be given the role, but he was passed over a second time when Hawke ultimately decided to appoint John Kerin. However, Kerin's period as Treasurer was troubled, and after Hawke was forced to sack Kerin for making a public gaffe in December 1991, Willis was finally appointed to the role of Treasurer in his place. Keating Government Willis's initial time as Treasurer was brief as Paul Keating launched a second and this time successful challenege to Hawke, just three weeks later. Keating had long promised to appoint his close political ally John Dawkins as Treasurer, and so Keating moved Willis back to the role of Finance Minister in order to accommodate this. Willis retained the role after Labor unexpectedly won a fifth consecutive election in 1993, and was expected to remain in the role until the sudden resignation of Dawkins in December 1993, who had grown frustrated with the role. Willis was duly appointed as Treasurer for a second time by Keating, and was responsible for helping to roll-out the Government's major 'One Nation' economic package on which it had won the 1993 election, including a round of middle-income tax cuts and the establishment of a national infrastructure commission. Willis remained as Treasurer until the 1996 election, which Labor heavily lost; in the weeks before the election, Willis chose to unilaterally release a letter purportedly written by Liberal Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett, which suggested that a Coalition Government led by John Howard would cut grants to the states. However, media examination quickly revealed the letter to be a forgery, allegedly foisted on Willis by Melbourne University Liberal Club students. This successful ruse had a significantly adverse impact upon the last week of Labor's campaign. After the 1996 election, Willis chose to move to the backbench and announced his retirement from Parliament prior to the 1998 election. Willis was one of only three people to be a member of the Cabinet continuously during the Hawke- Keating Government between 1983 and 1996, the other two being Kim Beazley and Gareth Evans. At the time of his retirement from Parliament, Willis was the only MP from the time of the Whitlam Government still serving. Following his retirement from politics, Willis has served on several boards of companies and charities. Honours Willis was awarded the Centenary Medal in 2001 for long service to the Commonwealth Parliament. On 13 June 2011, he was named an Officer of the Order of Australia for distinguished service to the Parliament of Australia, particularly in the areas of economic development and industrial relations, to the superannuation industry, and to the community. On 2 June 2009, Willis was conferred with the degree of Doctor of the University Honoris Causa from Victoria University for services to Australia and in particular the Western Suburbs of Melbourne.

The current population is about 250. A synod of the Roman Catholic Provincial Council of Armagh was held in Owengallees, Baunbuidhe (Bawnboy) on 25 May 1669 where the Bishop of Kilmore, Eugene MacSweeney tried to depose Thomas Fitzsimons, the vicar general of the diocese.Lynch, De Praesulibus Hiberniae, Vol. I, p. 256. Bawnboy is part of the ancient parish of Templeport, birthplace of St Mogue. Its most famous building is a Victorian workhouse, built in 1853, long disused and now derelict. Name Bawnboy takes its name from the term \\"bawn\\", the defensive wall surrounding an Irish tower house. It is the anglicised version of the Irish word badh√∫n meaning \\"cattle-stronghold\\" or \\"cattle-enclosure\\" ‚Äì its original purpose was to protect cattle during an attack. The remains of a late medieval bawn is to be seen at Bawnboy House, which is the origin of the village name. The earliest surviving mention of the placename is in the 1663 Hearth Money Rolls for Templeport where it is called Baonboy. Another name for the village is Kilsub or Kilsob.KILSUB, or BAWNBOY, a village, in the parish of TEMPLEPORT, barony of TULLAGHAGH, county of CAVAN, and province of ULSTER The 1622 Survey of County Cavan states: Sir Richard Greames, holdeth 1000 acres of this land, upon which there is built a Bawne of stone and lyme, sixty foot square and nine foot high, with a little stone house within, where in Lieutenant William Ruttledge dwelleth and hath a lease thereof and of 200 acres of land for 21 yeares and the rest of Sir Richard‚Äôs 1000 acres are sett to the Irish from yeare to yeare, who plowgh after ye Irish fashion. A lease dated 10 December 1774 from William Crookshank to John Enery of Bawnboy includes the lands of Bawnboy. Population In the Hearth Money Rolls compiled on 29 September 1663The Hearth Money Rolls for the Baronies of Tullyhunco and Tullyhaw, County Cavan, edited by Rev. Francis J. McKiernan, in Breifne Journal. Vol. I, No. 3 (1960), pp. 247-263 there were three taxpayers listed in Baonboy- William Lawther Esq., Stephen Murphy and Patricke Atcheson. The 1821 Census of Ireland states that the population of the village was 189. The 1831 Census of Ireland states that there were 12 houses in the village, all occupied. The population was 60, of which 28 were males and 32 females, so the population had dropped by 129 since 1821. The occupations were 2 female servants, 1 male servant, 1 professional, 4 retailers or craftsmen, 6 agricultural labourers, 4 farmers. The Bawnboy Valuation Office Field books are available for 1839-1840. The 1841 Census of Ireland states that there were 26 houses in the village, 8 of which were unoccupied. The population was 96, of which 47 were males and 49 females, so the population had increased by 36 since 1831. Bawnboy National School The book Bawnboy and Templeport History Heritage Folklore by Chris Maguire gives the following description of the school: :The right to teach in schools was restored to Catholics under the Relief Act of 1772 and from that time onward education progressed in the parish. The second Report from the Commissioners of Irish Education Inquiry 1826 shows that eight schools were operating in the parish of Templeport, including Bawnboy School. They were attended by a total of 670 pupils. All except one of these schools were mud wall cabins and overcrowded. Reading, writing and arithmetic were the main subjects taught. Bawnboy was a pay school held in a temporary room. The headmaster was Charles Brady, a Roman Catholic, who had a salary of ¬£8 per annum. There were 80 pupils of whom 68 were Catholic and 12 Church of Ireland. 47 were boys and 33 were girls. In 1831 a state system of primary education came into being under which the National Education Board was set up. Between 1839 and 1849 Bawnboy was taken over under the National Board at the request of Rev. Philip Magauran P.P. :BAWNBOY N.S. was formerly called St. Mogue's and is now named St. Aidan's N.S. It was officially opened on 31st August 1971. Principal Teachers of Bawnboy N.S. : Peter O'Neill (1841-'45); F.

This usually has a vintage car show, jam testing, fancy dress contest and numerous stalls which sell cakes and other objects.  First Farming Society  The earliest Farming Society founded in County Cavan was in Bawnboy in 1800. Sir Charles Coote in his ‚ÄòStatistical Survey of County Cavan‚Äô, 1801, page 289 writes: :‚ÄúThere had not been any farming society in Cavan, at the time I was collecting the materials for this survey; however I now learn, that a society is established at Bawnboy, of which Mr. Sneyd is president, who represents the county. So important are the advantages resulting from the meetings and communications of experimental and judicious farmers, that they should meet every encouragement. No part of Cavan is less engaged in manufacture, than the vicinity of the members of this new society; nor are there any lands so favourably disposed for improvement, if we consider the small rents,and the valuable change, which is wrought on the soil of this hilly region by a small applicationof lime, and a little persevering industry. The encouragement now held out by the Farming Society of Ireland, to the minor establishments, will be doubtless no small incentive to us to cultivate our lands, and bring into immediate profit those valuable resources, which have lain too long neglected, though possessing capabilities enough to procure true wealth and independence.‚Äù Coote also says on page 125: :‚ÄúDescending towards Ballyconnell, the prospect improves, where Mr. Sneyd's plantations, at Bawnboy, give the country a warmer and more comfortable appearance, but the roads in this country are terribly bad indeed.\\" And on page 138: :‚ÄúThe plantations are but few; Mr. Sneyd's, of Bawnboy, are contiguous to the small village of the same name, rank foremost amongst those, and his demesne shews a judicious management\\". The Mr.Sneyd referred to was Nathaniel Sneyd, a Member of Parliament for County Cavan from 1800-1826 and married to a Miss Montgomery of Ballyconnell. The Enery's of Bawnboy were his in-laws.  Services and infrastructure  The Garda station closed at the end of January 2013. The village is situated on the N87 road (Ireland) and the L1037 road.  Transport  Bawnboy Road railway station opened on 24 October 1887 and finally closed on 1 April 1959. It was part of the narrow gauge Cavan and Leitrim Railway. Leydons Coaches operate route 930 linking the village to Ballyconnell, Belturbet, Cavan, Swanlinbar and Enniskillen. Until mid-October 2012 Bawnboy was served several times daily by Bus √âireann Expressway route 30.

She was one of the most renowned singers of the age, and was one of the four concerto di donne at the Ferrara court of the d'Este family, for whom many composers wrote in a progressive style.  Life and murder  She was the daughter of the famous poet Giovanni Battista Guarini, author of Il pastor fido. Details of her early years are scanty, but it is known that she began her employment with the court of the d'Este family at the age of seventeen, and immediately attracted attention for the beauty and control of her singing voice. In addition to singing, she was a talented player of the lute. The Duchess of Ferrara, Margherita Gonzaga d'Este, apparently kept her and the other three members of the concerto di donne (Laura Peverara, Tarquinia Molza and Livia d'Arco) as frequent companions wherever she went; and the four musicians sang so beautifully together that they became famous throughout Italy. In 1585 she was married to Count Ercole Trotti. Circumstantial evidence suggests it was an arranged marriage; he was much older than she was, and there is also evidence that the marriage was not happy. In 1596 she was accused, evidently without justification, of having an affair with a member of the Duke's armed forces. Ercole Bevilacqua also had to flee Ferrara due to Trotti's suspicions that he had had an affair with Anna. Although Duke Alfonso had ordered Trotti not to harm Anna, the Duke died in 1597 and, on 3 May 1598, Trotti surprised Anna in her bedroom while she lay ill with a fever, and aided by an accomplice -- her own brother, Girolamo -- he murdered her with a hatchet. Trotti not only was pardoned by the new Duke of Modena, Cesare d'Este, but increased in prestige. At any rate, in 1598 the period of musical experimentation at the Ferrara court ended with the takeover of the town by the Papal States under Pope Clement VIII.  Influence  The addition of women's voices, and in particular the high soprano range, was one of the most significant events in the history of singing in the late 16th century. Prior to this time almost all music was written for male voices. Anna Guarini was one of the most influential of the virtuoso singers in the upper soprano range during this transitional period. The four singers of the concerto di donne inspired numerous compositions by the leading composers of the court, including Luzzasco Luzzaschi, Lodovico Agostini, and others. In addition, their fame was so widespread that composers from elsewhere -- such as the nobleman Carlo Gesualdo, Prince of Venosa (who also murdered his first wife) -- came to Ferrara specifically to write music for them. Anna was famous for her vocal virtuosity and the beauty of her voice, and Agostini dedicated specific madrigals to her specifically in his third book of madrigals (1582). The vogue for music written for soprano voices was to prove durable; indeed it has never ended. Monteverdi's first book of madrigals (1587) features soprano voices as the main attraction; in most of the pieces the bass voice only enters after a rest of several bars, allowing the upper voices to begin. The poet Torquato Tasso praised her in verse, in his Mentre in concento alterno, as did Agostini himself in the introduction to his 1582 madrigal collection.

Lugalbanda prominently features as the hero of two Sumerian stories dated to the Ur III period (21st century BCE), called by scholars Lugalbanda I (or Lugalbanda in the Mountain Cave) and Lugalbanda II (or Lugalbanda and the Anzu Bird). Both are known only in later versions, although there is an Ur III fragment that is quite different from either 18th century versionMichalowski, P.

These tales are part of a series of stories that describe the conflicts between Enmerkar, king of Unug (Uruk), and Ensuhkeshdanna, lord of Aratta, presumably in the Iranian highlands. In these two stories, Lugalbanda is a soldier in the army of Enmerkar, whose name also appears in the Sumerian King List as the first king of Uruk and predecessor of Lugalbanda. The extant fragments make no reference to Lugalbanda's succession as king following Enmerkar.For a detailed treatment of Enmerkar and Lugalbanda stories see: Vanstiphout, H. (2003). Epics of Sumerian Kings, Atlanta: SBL. Lugalbanda appears in Sumerian literary sources as early as the mid-3rd millennium, as attested by a mythological text from Abu Salabikh that describes a romantic relationship between Lugalbanda and Ninsun.Jacobsen, Thorkild (1989) ‚ÄúLugalbanda and Ninsuna‚Äù, Journal of Cuneiform Studies Vol. 41, No. 1, pp. 69-86 A deified Lugalbanda often appears as the husband of the goddess Ninsun.

For a full summary of the god-list references refer to Reallexikon der Assyriologie 7, p. 118. Ample evidence for the worship of Lugalbanda as a deity comes from the Ur III period, as attested in tablets from Nippur, Ur, Umma and Puzrish-Dagan.Reallexikon der Assyriologie 7, pp. 119‚Äì120. Nippur tablets indicate that all Ur III kings have made offerings to the deity Lugalbanda In Old Babylonian period, Sin-kashid of Uruk is known to have built a temple called √â-KI.KAL dedicated to Lugalbanda and Ninsun, and to have assigned his daughter Ni≈°i-ƒ´nƒ´-≈°u as the eresh-dingir priestess of Lugalbanda.Reallexikon der Assyriologie 7, p. 120 In royal hymns of the Ur III period, Ur-Nammu of Ur and his son Shulgi describe Lugalbanda and Ninsun as their holy parents, and in the same context call themselves the brother of Gilgamesh.Reallexikon der Assyriologie 7, p. 131.

Arab on Radar Interview mentioning Providence bands They have been active in the punk scene since 1991, Interview with drummer (1st question) having been formed in January of that year. The band's songs are generally short and very fast-paced, with few lasting longer than one minute. Other famous crust punk and grindcore bands like Nasum have covered some of their songs. The band has a strong do-it-yourself ethic.  History  Meeting in Providence in 1989, they started playing as Hellocaust. After reconfiguring the lineup, a name change, and a great increase in speed and intensity, Dropdead was officially formed in January 1991. The first show happened in April 1991 with Born Against and Rorschach. They are currently writing material for their third full length record, the follow up to their 1998 Untitled album. They plan on recording it with Kurt Ballou at GodCity Studio, hoping for a 2019 release.

Her parents are the deities Anu and Uras. Ninsun has also been linked to older deities. Mythology In the Epic of Gilgamesh, Ninsun is depicted as a human queen who lives in Uruk with her son as king. Since the father of Gilgamesh was former king Lugalbanda, it stands to reason that Ninsun procreated with Lugalbanda to give birth. She assists her son at the beginning of his adventures by helping to interpret his dreams. Also in the Epic of Gilgamesh, Ninsun is summoned by Gilgamesh and Enkidu to help pray to the god Utu to help the two on their journey to the Country of the Living to battle Humbaba. Names In the Tello relief at ancient Laga≈°, dating to ca. 2150 BC, her name is written in cuneiform dNIN.SUMUN2. The meaning of sumun in Sumerian is \\"wild cow\\" and her name is also attested as dNIN.SUMUN2.NA Nin- sumunak, revealing its origin as a genitive phrase meaning \\"lady of the wild cows\\". The sign SUMUN2 was formerly read SUN2, leading to the widespread usage of the name Ninsun. Other names include Rimat-Ninsun (from Akkadian rimƒÅtu \\"cattle\\"), the \\"August Cow\\", the \\"Wild Cow of the Enclosure\\", and \\"The Great Queen\\". Related deities In Sumerian mythology, Ninsun was originally called Gula until her name was later changed to Ninisina. Later, Gula became identified with the Babylonian goddess Nintinugga. According to \\"Pabilsag's Journey to Nibru,\\" Ninsun was originally named Nininsina. According to the ancient Babylonian text, Nininsina wedded Pabilsag near a riverbank and gave birth to Damu as a result of the union. Other sources give Gunura as Ninsun's husband and Damu's father.

The Islands belong to the South Andaman administrative district, part of the Indian union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Etymology The archipelago is named after an 18th-century British marine surveyor, John Ritchie, who spent nearly two decades in the employ of the Council of Bengal charting and documenting the Andaman's and surrounding regions. The individual islands are largely named after British generals and civil officials serving in India at the time of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Of the archipelago which now bears his name, Ritchie's accounts and maps were the first reliable sources of information on the islands, which until then were very sketchily known to Europeans. Ritchie was one who championed that the British administration in India make further investigation and use of the Andamans. During Ritchie's time these entreaties were largely ignored. Perhaps frustrated and disillusioned after years of thankless work under difficult circumstances, Ritchie requested to be returned for home leave, which he was in 1787. An extract from his parting note to his superiors explained: > \\"The condition of my health being such as requires an immediate change of > climate... after a series of 19 years continuous service in the office of > Marine Surveyor, I hope there is no impropriety in my requesting the favour, > also... to continue my allowance to me... It is a small salary, and the > receipt of it has been the only advantage I have ever reaped from the > Company's service, and because my Line of Service, from its singularity, has > had no gradation of advancement... whilst its Duties have been uncommonly > severe, uncommonly hazardous, and equally unprofitable; for what advantage > could be obtained from tracking a Labyrinth of Woods and Rivers? Or from > exploring the Shoals of a shelving and broken Sea Coast? All of which > uninhabited, and seldom visited, except perhaps in the disastrous case of > shipwreck... In the meantime it has been from my Labours, that the Hon'ble > Company have obtained all authentic knowledge of the Sea Coast and Tide > Rivers of their possessions in Bengal, together with other services more > important and beneficial.\\"Ritchie overstates the \\"uninhabited\\" nature of the > islands, since he was well aware of the existence of the indigenous tribes, > and had spent some time in the company and direct presence of several of > them Two years after Ritchie's departure, an attempt was made to set up a colony in the Andamans, but this was aborted after only a few years. It was not until 1867 that a permanent European presence was established, when the whole islands were annexed by the British and a penal colony established at Ross Island(Subash Chandra Bose Island ) on South Andaman Island. Geography The islands are located in the Bay of Bengal, bordering with the Andaman Sea and are some south of the nearest Asian mainland, Cape Negrais in Myanmar. The archipelago comprises 4 larger islands, 3 medium islands, and 10 smaller islands and islets, extending in a roughly north‚Äìsouth chain, parallel to the main Great Andaman group. Baratang Island and South Andaman Island lie to the west across Diligent Strait; the active volcano Barren Island is further to the east. The islands of Ritchie's Archipelago run in a closely spaced arc which extends about from the southernmost Rose Island. to North Button I., with Diligent Strait between them and Great Andaman ranging from to less than . Most of the islands are clustered closely together separated by only narrow, almost river-like channels. The exceptions are Rose Island and Neill Island to the south of Havelock Island, and the three small Button islands which are smaller outliers to the north of the group. The interior of most of the islands consists of undulating hills and plains, with a topography generally not exceeding above mean sea level. Wilson Island rises to 216 m. Occasionally the land rises reasonably abruptly from the sea to a domed plateau, and there are a few rocky coastal cliffs; however, in the main the coastlines are relatively flat, interspersed by both rocky and sand beaches and some low- lying lagoons and estuaries on the larger islands. Coral reefs surround many of the islands, particularly on the \\"sea-ward\\" (i.e., eastern) coastlines. Havelock, John Lawrence, Henry Lawrence, Peel and Outram Is. have a few tidal creeks winding into their interiors; in general freshwater streams are few. Islands The main islands in the archipelago (in decreasing order of approximate size) are: * Havelock Island - * Henry Lawrence Island - * John Lawrence Island - , formerly inhabited * Peel Island - * Wilson Island - * Outram Island - * Neill Island - Administration Politically, Ritchie's Archipelago is part of Port Blair Taluk.  Demographics  The islands were originally populated by the indigenous Great Andamanese peoples, in particular the tribal and linguistic grouping known as Aka-Bale. However, as the populations of the various Andamanese indigenous peoples declined greatly in the decades following the establishment of colonial settlements by the British Raj (and later, independent India), the indigenous communities of these islands have vanished. The present population of the islands consists of immigrant Indian and a few Karen (Burmese) settlers. The 2011 census of India reported 9,355 people living on two inhabited islands of Ritchie's Archipelago: Havelock Island and Neill Island. Transportation Port Blair, is located approximately to the southwest of the archipelago, accessible via a 3-5 hour ferry trip.

He was the 1970 championship crew chief for Bobby Isaac. He inspired the Harry Hogge character in the movie Days of Thunder. Early life Born in Brownsville, Kentucky on January 17, 1925, he learned to be a mechanic in the Army during World War II. Upon returning home he worked as an auto mechanic and drove race cars for a couple years, then continued racing as a car builder for local competitions in Kentucky, Indiana, and Ohio. Racing career In 1965 he was hired by Nord Krauskopf to be the crew chief of the K&K; Insurance team. By 1969 the team began to see considerable success with driver Bobby Isaac, winning 17 races. In 1970 the team won the NASCAR championship and Hyde was named Mechanic of the Year. The K&K; team was one of the leaders through most of the 1970s, but in 1977 Krauskopf sold the team to J. D. Stacy. The team continued to win some races, but in 1978 the relationship between Stacy and Hyde deteriorated and Hyde left the team in mid-June. Late in 1978 Hyde would sue Stacy, and eventually would win. In 1979 Amelio Scott hired Hyde to be the crew chief for his family team in 1979 with his son Tighe Scott as the driver. Their first race together was the 1979 Daytona 500. Scott finished sixth in the race. At the following race at Rockingham Speedway, Scott recorded his best NASCAR result when he finished fourth. They competed in 15 more events that season and ten more in 1980 before parting ways. In 1980 Hyde opened his own racing engine shop and supplied engines to various teams. In 1984, he was hired by Rick Hendrick to be crew chief for a team he was partner in, All Star Racing. The partnership did not work out, and Hendrick bought the team out forming Hendrick Motorsports. The team won three races in 1984 with Geoff Bodine driving. Hyde was then paired with new driver Tim Richmond, a young open-wheel racer from Ashland, Ohio, as Hendrick went to a two-car operation. The brashness of the new driver from outside the southern stock car circuit did not initially sit well with the notably irascible Hyde. However, after a few races they developed a relationship and began to win races. This season was the source of much of the story line for the motion picture Days of Thunder. Hyde's character was portrayed by Robert Duvall. The team was very successful in 1986. Richmond won 7 races and finished third in points behind legends Dale Earnhardt and Darrell Waltrip. Richmond, who was noted for womanizing, was diagnosed with AIDS during 1987 and missed most of the season with illness which he explained to the public as pneumonia. Richmond returned to the track in the Miller High Life 500 at Pocono. Driving like a man on a mission, he overcame a shifter problem to put the Folgers No. 25 Chevrolet back into victory lane. The very next week he outclassed the field in the Budweiser 400 at Riverside, bringing home his final Winston Cup victory. Jimmy Means drove Richmond's Folgers Chevrolet in the Oakwood Homes 500 at Charlotte, but the No. 25 was reversed to No. 52, which was Jimmy's normal car number. He crashed on lap 20, finishing 40th. Car owner Rick Hendrick drove the Folgers No. 25 in the Winston Western 500 at Riverside, not fairing much better. He left the race on lap 75 with transmission trouble, finishing 33rd. Ken Schrader became the driver for the No. 25 team in 1988 but Hendrick had become a three car operation, and Hyde sometimes felt ignored. He left after the season to become crew chief for Stavola Brothers Racing where he worked through the first half of the 1991 season, before moving to Chad Little's No. 19 Bullseye BBQ/Tyson Foods Ford. Hyde had 48 career victories. His forte was setting up cars for specific tracks.

Role in the Epic of Gilgamesh In the earlier Old Babylonian version of the Epic, she attempts to dissuade Gilgamesh in his quest for immortality, urging him to be content with the simple pleasures of life. Later influence Several scholars suggest direct borrowing of Siduri's advice by the author of Ecclesiastes.e.g. Van Der Torn, Karel, \\"Did Ecclesiastes copy Gilgamesh?\\", BR, 16/1 (Feb 2000), pp. 22ff The advice given by Siduri has been seen as the first expression of the concept of carpe diem, although some scholars see it as urging Gilgamesh to abandon his mourning, \\"reversing the liminal rituals of mourning and returning to the normal and normative behaviors of Mesopotamian society.\\" Siduri has been compared to the Odyssey's Circe. Like Odysseus, Gilgamesh receives directions on how to reach his destination from a divine helper. In this case it is the goddess Siduri, who, like Circe, dwells by the sea at the ends of the earth. Her home is also associated with the sun: Gilgamesh reaches Siduri's house by passing through a tunnel underneath Mount Mashu, the high mountain from which the sun comes into the sky.

It is the capital city of the province of Iloilo where it is geographically situated but, in terms of government and administration, it is politically independent. In addition, it is the center of the Iloilo-Guimaras Metropolitan Area, as well as the regional center and primate city of the Western Visayas region.

Founded in 1566 when the Spaniards established a settlement area between the towns of Oton and the city's present district of La Villa Rica de Arevalo (Villa de Arevalo), Iloilo City is the second Spanish colonial center after Cebu in the Philippine islands. It is one of the Royal Spanish Cities in the Philippines in the Spanish Asia along with Naga and Manila. An honorific royal title, \\"La Muy Leal y Noble Ciudad\\" (\\"The Most Loyal and Noble City\\") was given by Queen Regent of Spain, Maria Christina, through the city's loyalty to the Spanish crown during the Philippine revolution, the second city to have so in the country after the City of Manila. A second to the primate city of Manila at the turn of 20th century in economy, foreign and local commercial establishments lines the whole stretch of Calle Real (Iloilo's Escolta and old business district), an agricultural experimental station established at La Paz in 1888, a school of arts and trades which opened in 1891, and a telephone network system operating in the metropolis in 1894. The city is the site of the Jaro Metropolitan Cathedral, the seat of Roman Catholicism in Western Visayas and the first National Shrine dedicated to Marian devotion in Visayas and Mindanao (2nd National Shrine after the one in Cebu); the Archdiocese of Jaro, one of the oldest and largest archdioceses in the country founded as a parish in 1587; and Nuestra Se√±ora de la Candelaria (Virgin of Candelaria), the first marian image crowned personally without a papal legate by a pope and saint in the Philippines and Asia (by Pope John Paul III). Iloilo is the last capital of Spanish Empire in Asia and the Pacific before the Philippines was ceded to the United States in 1898 through the Treaty of Paris. The city is the regional hub of education, culinary, religion, healthcare, tourism, culture, industry and economy in Western Visayas. Delectable cuisine that came Iloilo is famous of are Pancit Molo, La Paz Batchoy, Laswa and Kansi. Several regional national government offices, financial institutions and government- owned and controlled corporations held offices in the city. Iloilo city is one of the thriving economic centers in the country - an adequate and growing number of banks establishing branches leads the metropolis as the city with the most number of banks savings deposits and accounts in the Western Visayas region (third in the Philippines); the modernly built Iloilo International Airport is the 4th busiest airport in the country; the Port of Iloilo which is one of the historical ports in the Philippine islands is now one of the busiest ports and natural harbor in the country by terms of passenger movement and cargo handling; and with the on-going building construction boom especially in the real estate and retail sectors.

Panay might be named after the kingdom of Pannai which is located in Sumatra, since i and y are interchangeable in Spanish. Proof for this is corroborated by linguistic evidence such as Talang Tuo inscription where many Old Malayan words during Srivijayan survived in modern Ilongo Language. The Srivijayan City states of Sumatra was ruled by an Indian King MahƒÅrƒÅja with their Datu, a lesser vassal Malayan chieftain.Kota Kapur inscription mentioned \\"manraksa yan kadatuan √ßrivijaya\\"  Period of Malay Mass Migration  Cruel rule of a certain Rajah Makatunao, the ten Bornean datus sailed to the island which they named Panay, Pani or Panae (shortened word for Ananipay) as part of Visayan Empire. The Malayan Datus offered a golden hat (salakot) and a long pearl necklace called Manangyad in the Hiligaynon language (meaning a long necklace that touches or \\"nagasangyad\\" the ground) as a barter to the Ati to allow them entry and habitation of the island. The Datus founded the Kadatuan Srivijaya consisted of several settlements called wanua/Benua/Banwa as corroborated by Kota Kapur inscription. Some historians also affirm the Sumatran origin of the people of Panay, observing that the Visayans derived their writing system from those of Toba, Borneo, Celebes, Ancient Java and from the Edicts of the ancient Indian emperor Ashoka. The very probable proof of Sumatran origin of the Malay settlement in Panay is the account of P. Francisco Colin, S.J, a historian who came to Asia during the early years of the Spanish conquest of the Philippines. The following is his personal observation recorded during his visit to Sumatra: So, Colin concluded that the Tagalogs and Pampangos, and other political or ethnic groups (Visayans and other related civilized groups), by symbols used in expressing language, by color of dress and costume, one can believe that these came from parts of Borneo and Sumatra. The phrase \\"subjugated ethnic groups\\" gives hint to the encroaching of the Majapahit Empire into the falling Srivijaya Empire, or perhaps to the Islamization of Sumatra, forcing the inhabitants to look for safer territories where they could preserve their freedom and culture. This resonates with the local Panay tradition regarding the arrival of ten Datus from Borneo. The kingdom of Pannai was a militant-nation allied under the Srivijaya Mandala that defended the conflict-ridden Strait of Malacca, the world's busiest maritime choke-point. The Visayan lore says that in the 13th century, ten Bornean datus came to the island which they named Panay, Pani or Panae (after the fallen kingdom of Pannai or a shortening of the Ati word for the island, Ananipay). This, after they dissented from the unjust rule of a certain Rajah Makatunao and exiled themselves. Upon arriving on the island of Panay, they gave a golden hat (salakot) and a long pearl necklace called Manangyad in the Hiligaynon language (meaning a long necklace that touches or \\"nagasangyad\\" the ground) as a peace offering and treaty-items to the Ati natives of the island. It was said that it was also a way of the ten Bornean datus to barter the flat lands of Panay from the Ati. One datu, named Paiburong, was given the territory of Irong-Irong (cf. also Kedatuan of Madja-as).The noble people of Panay (and thus Iloilo City) claim descent from these idealistic rebel royals and their few faithful and loyal soldiers who chose to abandon a wealthy but oppressed life under a foreign empire in Sumatra and Borneo and instead, build a state that was truer to their ideals in Panay island. The Kedatuan of Madja- as centered in Panay island eventually grew a powerful and strong naval presence that it rivaled the nearby states of the Rajahnate of Cebu, The Kingdom of Maynila and the Sultanate of Sulu when it came to wealth and prestige.http://vicilongo.weebly.com/ In Panay, according to Friar Gaspar de San Agust√≠n, O.S.A., \\"...in the ancient times, there was a trading center and a court of the most illustrious nobility in the whole island.\\"Mamuel Merino, O.S.A., ed., Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas (1565‚Äì1615), Madrid: Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, 1975, pp. 374‚Äì376. By the 14th century, under Datu Padojinog, this state had grown so powerful militarily and economically, their naval power regularly threatened Chinese Imperial shipping. This was so much so, that the Chuan-chou gazetteer specifically reported that the Pisheya/Bisaya (another term for people from Irong-Irong) consistently made devastating raids against the Empire's commerce.Chuan-chou Fu-chi (Ch.10) Year 1612  Early Spanish colonial period  Charles V In 1519, Charles V I already acquired and inherited Catholic kingdoms. He is the King of all Spain, King of Germany and Holy Roman Emperor, Duke of Burgundy and Luxembourg, Count of Holland, Count of Barcelona, Count of Flanders, Prince of Asturias, Archduke of Austria, King of Aragon, King of Jerusalem, Catalonia, Valencia, Naples, two Sicilies, Corsica and Sardinia.

He commissioned Ferdinand Magellan to circumnavigate the globe especially to establish International Trade in Spice Island. The dangerous and uncertain voyage as 5 ships with 270 men departs from Seville and by 1520, the expedition have traversed for months calm Ocean they called Pacifico or Peaceful.Laurence Bergreen, Over the Edge of the World: Magellan's Terrifying Circumnavigation of the Globe HarperCollins Publishers [2003] The mountains of Samar and Leyte was visible as they drew closed which the crew called \\" Las Velas \\" or the Sails. They disembark in unpopulated Homonhon Island for a week from a long journey for food and water and called the place as \\" Buenas Senas\\" or good sign. They navigated through Strait of Siargapo and landed Limasawa Island and received peacefully by locals. Delighted, the Spaniards planted a cross on a hill and first mass was celebrated. It was the first Spanish settlement and the birthplace of Christianity in the Philippines. The locals introduced to visit another kinsman chieftain along the Butuan River. King of Butuan received the Spaniards in 8 April 1521. Returning to Limasawa, The Prince of Limasawa also told them about 3 powerful Kedatuan - in Sugbu, Yrong-yrong and Tondo. In 17 March 1521, Magellan named newly discovered Island as \\" Las islas de San L√°zaro \\" . By 7 April, Magellan arrived in Sugbu . . Datu Zula of Mactan sent Magellan 2 goats. Humabon tricked Magellan to kill Lapu Lapu, the Datu or chieftain of nearby Mactan Island.Nowell, Charles E. (1962). Magellan's Voyage Around the World: Three Contemporary Accounts. Northwestern University Press. The men of Humabon who accompanied Magellan did not engage in battle with Lapu-Lapu. Magellan was hit by a poisoned arrow he turned toward his men who are returning to the ships and fell down. The next day, Rajah Humabon of Sugbu offered a Banquet for Spaniards. Twenty-seven Spanish sailors died due to poisoning by Cebuanos. Rajah Humabon restored friendly relations with Lapu- Lapu, as he is married to Hara Humamay, Lapu-lapu niece. Under Philip II, on 1565, the Spaniards in Mexico returned to Cebu to avenge Magellan death against treachery of Cebuanos. Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi pillaged and burned houses in Cebu for days . Cebuanos retreated, fearing the heavily-armored Spaniards now with formidable reformed-infantry called Tercios composed of alabardero, alf√©rez with a sword and Arcabucero with gunpowder.Scott, William Henry (1992) p. 48 Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi directed Felipe de Salcedo along with Spanish Friar Mart√≠n de Rada and other Augustinian missionaries to look for food. They disembarked in Iloilo and established a temporary settlement in Araut somewhere in Dumangas. In 1566, they founded a settlement in the areas between Ogtong (Oton) and the present day La Villa Rica de Arevalo district of Iloilo City. Though founded in 1566, Oton, which forms a big part of area in the said settlement with Arevalo, was established formally in 1572 as the second official (third after the town of Oton) Spanish colonial outpost after Cebu City). Unlike the Indianized Cebuanos who were neutral to the Spaniards or the partially Islamized Tagalogs of Manila who were more hostile, the people of Madja-as welcomed the Iberians as allies since at that time period, Madja-as was locked in a war against the invading Muslims, especially with the Sultanate of Brunei and its vassal states, the Sultanate of Sulu and the Kingdom of Maynila which, according to Spanish Governor-General Franciso de Sande, are their blood-cousins. The people then fervently accepted Christianity as they supplied the bulk of the mercenaries used in the conquest of partially Islamized Manila, whose rulers were related to the Sultan of Brunei. When the Spaniards came to the Visayas, they noted that the pirates among them were more terrifying than the Mohammedans of Jolo and Mindanao. All year long, after the harvest, they would sail toward faraway places to hunt slaves and make surprise attacks on settlements. Those who did not live along the rivers, would make their raids in the months of February, March, April, October and November, going deeper into the interior parts of the islands, sacking the villages. These raiding expeditions are called panggubat (noun) or manggubat (gerund verb form). The Plan of the Fort of Iloilo in 1738, formerly called Fortificaci√≥n de Nuestra Se√±ora del Rosario en el Puerto de Yloylo, Provincia de Oton, in the early 1700s. However, upon Christianization and Hispanization, the fiercest slave-raiders among the Philippine islands, the people Panay and the other Christianized peoples of the archipelago were converted and reformed and they abandoned the practice of slaving, piracy and raiding and contended themselves to be simple soldiers or farmers.Schwalbenberg, Henry M. \\"The Economics of Pre-Hispanic Visayan Slave Raiding,\\" Philippine Studies 42, no. 3 (1994) 376-84.Salman, Michael. \\"Resisting Slavery in the Philippines: Ambivalent Domestication and the Reversibility of Comparisons,\\" Slavery & Abolition 25 no. 2 (2004) 30. In 1581, Ronquillo moved the colonial center from Ogtong to approximately eastward due to recurrent raids by Moro pirates and Dutch and English privateers. He renamed this new colonial seat La Villa Rica de Ar√©valo in honor of his hometown in √Åvila, Spain. Ronquillo also settled groups of Spanish and Mexican soldiers to become the first colonists of Arevalo as he built his mansion in the area.\\"A History of the Philippines by David P. Barrows\\" Page 147. The few years of Ronquillo‚Äôs reign were in other ways important. A colony of Spaniards was established at Oton, on the island of Panay, which was given the name of Ar√©valo (Iloilo). The Chinese traders supplying the colonists then established themselves in Iloilo's parian Molo. Meanwhile, Jaro was soon filled up with various kinds of mestizos (Mixed raced people) and Mandurriao hosted the growing Indian community near the Nanak Darbar Indian Sikh Temple. At the early days of the Spanish period; the first Manila Galleons were originally constructed at the port of Oton to the west of Iloilo. Since there was no precedent in Spain for the immensity of a Manila- Galleon, it could be argued that the proto-type Manila galleons were of Visayan design since the Visayans were already constructing huge multi-masted 4 to 5 decked caracoas in their wars against the other kingdoms and thus, the technical know-how to construct the first Manila galleons was an amelioration of Visayan shipbuilding with Spanish shipbuilding. Oton built the first Manila galleons before operations were eventually transferred to the Bicol and Cavite shipyards.  1600s-1700s  In the year 1600, a large Muslim attack on Iloilo City was launched, with a force of 70 ships and 4,000 warriors, raiding and attacking several Visayan islands in order to abduct slaves. However, the attack was repulsed by a force of 1,000 Visayan warriors and 70 Mexican arquebusiers under the command of the Don Juan Garcia de Sierra (the Spanish alcalde mayor), who died in battle.Philippines: A Unique Nation By Dr. Sonia M. Zaide (2015) p. 150. [All Nations Publishing Co., Inc.] With the increase in Moro incursions toward the end of the sixteenth century, Spanish defenses in the Visayas were strengthened by the construction of a fort at Iloilo staffed by two companies of (Mexican) soldiers.San Agust√≠n, Conquistas, lib. 2 cap 37: 545 In 1635, in an effort to check the Islamic slave-raiding into the Visayas islands, the Christian Visayans from Iloilo together with Spanish officers and their Latino soldiers from Peru\\"SECOND BOOK OF THE SECOND PART OF THE CONQUESTS OF THE FILIPINAS ISLANDS, AND CHRONICLE OF THE RELIGIOUS OF OUR FATHER, ST. AUGUSTINE\\" (Zamboanga City History) \\"He (Governor Don Sebast√≠an Hurtado de Corcuera) brought a great reinforcements of soldiers, many of them from Per√∫, as he made his voyage to Acapulco from that kingdom.\\" soon founded Zamboanga City and settled in it, using it as fortress to prevent Moro attacks in the Visayas, and as a staging ground for Christian campaigns into Muslim Mindanao. In 1700, due to ever-increasing attacks especially from the Dutch and the Moros, the Spaniards again moved their seat of power some eastward to the village of Irong-Irong, which had natural and strategic defense against raids. At the mouth of the river that snakes through Panay, the Spaniards built the Fortificaci√≥n de Nuestra Se√±ora del Rosario en el Puerto de Yloylo, Provincia de OtonPlanos de las Plazas, Presidios, y Fortificaciones en todo el Distrito de las Provincias, que sugeta al Real Dominio en las Yslas Philipinas: Relaci√≥n de Artiller√≠a, Tren de manejo, Pertrechos de Guerra, Tropas regladas de Dotaci√≥n: Raciones, y Municiones, con Liquidaci√≥n, y Separaci√≥n de su Importaci√≥n en el A√±o: Producto de las Rentas y Consignaciones que se reporta segun el estado presente, dated 1738 (Manuscript drawn by Order of the Field Marshall Don Fernando Valdes y Tamon, Governor of the Philippine Islands from 1729 to 1739. The document is currently under the custody of the Archives of the Naval Museum in Madrid, Spain, p. 41. (now called Fort San Pedro) to better guard against the raids which were now the only threat to their hold on the islands. Irong-Irong or Ilong-Ilong was shortened to Iloilo. Later, the natural port area quickly became the capital of the province.  Sugar boom era & the late Spanish colonial period (1800s)  Aduana de Iloilo (Iloilo Customs House) is the second biggest customs house in the Philippines after the Aduana (Intendencia) de Manila in Intramuros. Spanish rule government allowed Chinese migrants which worked among the city's industries (the Locsin, Lopez, Jalandoni, Lim and Sy families) and Latinos from across the Pacific (Viceroyalty of New Spain) to man its military fortifications (the Araneta, De Rama and Arroyo families). In the late 18th century, the development of large-scale weaving industry started the movement of Iloilo's surge in trade and economy in the Visayas. Sometimes referred to as the \\"Textile Capital of the Philippines\\", the products were exported to Manila and other foreign places. Sinamay, pi√±a, and jusi are examples of the products produced by the looms of Iloilo. Because of the rise of the textile industry, there was also a rise of the upper middle class. However, with the introduction of cheap textile from the UK and the emergence of the sugar economy, the industry waned in the mid-19th century. Nelly Garden), which is regaled as the \\"Queen of all heritage houses in Iloilo\\" and Panay, is one of the grand mansions in the heritage district of Jaro that resulted from the sugar boom. The waning textile industry was replaced, however, by the opening of Iloilo's port to the world market in 1855. Because of this, Iloilo's industry and agriculture was put on direct access to foreign markets. But what triggered the economic boom of Iloilo in the 19th century was the development of the sugar industry in Iloilo and its neighboring island of Negros. Sugar during the 19th century was of high demand. Nicholas Loney, the British vice-consul in Iloilo, developed the industry by giving loans, constructing warehouses in the port, and introducing new technologies in sugar farming. The rich families of Iloilo developed large areas of Negros, which were later called haciendas, because of sugar's high demand in the world market. Because of the increase in commercial activity, infrastructures, recreational facilities, educational institutions, banks, foreign consulates, commercial firms and much more sprouted in Iloilo. On 5 October 1889, due to the economic development that was happening in Iloilo making it the most important port in the Philippine Islands next to Manila,Manila was occupied by Miguel Lopez de Salcedo as the colonial capital of the Archipelago on 24 June 1571, establishing it as the metropolis of Nueva Castilla (the name he gave to the Island of Luzon). Twenty-three years later, King Philip II confirmed the Salcedo's erection of Manila as a City, granting it all the privileges enjoyed by the colonial capitals of territories under his empire, through a royal cedula of 21 June 1594. Another royal cedula was issued by the Spanish Monarch granting Manila the title of Noble y siempre leal (Noble and ever loyal). Cf. FERRANDO, Fr Juan & FONSECA OSA, Fr Joaquin (1870‚Äì1872).

Iloilo was raised from the status of a town to a city through a Royal Decree,The actual words of the Royal Decree says: \\"A propuesta del Ministro de Ultramar, y teniendo en cuenta el creciente desarrollo que en la industria y el commercio ha alcanzado la cabecera de la provincia de Ilo- Ilo, la m√°s importante de las islas de Filipinas, despues de la de Manila; En nombre de mi Augusto Hijo el Rey D.

Decreto Real de la Reina Regente Maria Cristina (5 Octubre 1889) en Gazeta de Madrid, N. 298, 25 Octubre 1889, p. 238. and in 1890, the city government was established. In 1893, the royal Spanish decree was ratified through a 2nd (legal) declaration by the virtue of Bacura/Becerra Law. Iloilo City was the second most important city in the Archipelago at the end of the Spanish Regime.  The Revolutionary Period (1896)  Queen Regent Maria Cristina of Spain and her son King Alfonso XIII. The Queen Regent raised the status of Iloilo as a Royal City, on 5 October 1889, in the name of King Alfonso XIII, who was still a minor. The immediate reaction of Ilonggo elite to the outbreak of the 1896 rebellion in Manila was that of surprise. They immediately responded with protestations of outrage and affirmed their loyalty to Spain. The Ilonggos themselves were united in their support of Spain during the first two years of the revolutionary period.Policarpio F. Hernadez, Iloilo, the Most Noble City: History and Development (1566-1898), p. 143. Shortly after the Cry of Balintawak, the Jaro Ayuntamiento (another colonial city adjacent to Iloilo City), composed of native Ilonggos,The members of the Jaro Ayuntamiento who signed the act of protestation against the uprising were: Mariano Villalobos, Tranquilino Gonzales, Severino Arg√ºelles, Raimundo Escarilla, Vidal Jabelona, Ruperto Jalandoni, Esteban Jalandoni, Juan Ledesma, Pablo Ledesma, and Le√≥n Jereos (Secretary). Cf. 7 September 1896 issue of El Porvenir de Bisayas convened a special session on 1 September 1896, where the Manila uprising was condemned as an unpatriotic act \\"that finds no echo in the noble hearts of Jare√±os, who do not forget the immense gratitude they owe Spain who, from nothing, raised us to a life of civilization and progress.\\"Policarpio F. Hernadez, Iloilo, the Most Noble City: History and Development (1566-1898), p. 144. The actual text of the letter of the members of the Jaro Ayuntamiento addressed to the Governor General of the Philippines (published in the 7 September 1896 issue of El Porvenir de Bisayas) says: Estos hechos de sedici√≥n, doblemente criminales en las dolorosas circunstancias que afligen a la Patria com√∫n, que all√°, al otro lado de los mares, en los Campos de Cuba, est√° vertiendo sin tasa la generosa sangre de sus leales hijos que otros hijos integrados la hacen derramar; no pueden levantar eco en los corazones nobles de los Jare√±os, que no olvidan la inmensa gratitud que deben a Espa√±a que, de la nada... los hizos nacer a la vida de la civilizaci√≥n y del progreso. The Ayuntamiento of IloiloThe officials of the City of Iloilo who signed the letter of protestation were as follows: Victoriano Mapa (Primer Alcalde), Emilio Escay (Primer Teniente Alcalde), Arcadio Conde Otegui (Segundo Teniente Alcalde), Vanancio Conception, Jos√© Mar√≠a Aguilar, F√©lix de la Rama, Severino Dur√°n, Eduardo Arjanuate, Francisco Aguado, Francisco Ortiz, Lorenzo Guevara, Ram√≥n Roco, and Mariano Tea√±o - regidores. Cf. 7 September 1896 issue of El Porvenir de Bisayas. also affirmed its allegiance and loyalty to Spain and made a similar protestation. Condemning the uprising, the city's letter to the Governor General says: > \\"Those dark betrayals, the mere notion of which embarrasses good and loyal > Filipinos, have produced a unanimous sentiment of protest and indignation > among the Ilongo people, who engrave its most honorable blazon in the sacred > and inextinguishable love that it professes to the glorious Spanish > nationality that it legitimately feels proud of.

The foreign community in the city also asked its representatives to visit local authorities and to elevate their protests against the revolt. And so did the Filipino parish priests of Jaro, Molo, Mandurriao, and Ar√©valo.Cf. 3 September 1896 issue of El Porvenir de Bisayas. Also cf. Policarpio F. Hernadez, Iloilo, the Most Noble City: History and Development (1566-1898), p. 145. Towns in Iloilo province also condemned the Manila uprising, and those of the neighboring provinces of C√°piz and Antique, as well as the island of Negros, followed suit. This emboldened the Ilonggo elite to initiate the organization of volunteers to be sent to quell what was seen as a mostly- Tagalog rebellion. The move was backed by the Spanish and foreign communities of Iloilo.Cf. Policarpio F. Hernadez, Iloilo, the Most Noble City: History and Development (1566-1898), p. 145. A battalion of five hundred native volunteers was raised, which was divided into two companies, and placed under the cadre of mostly Spanish officers.Cf. 30 December 1896 issue of El Eco de Panay. Also cf. Policarpio F. Hernadez, Iloilo, the Most Noble City: History and Development (1566-1898), pp. 145-146. They arrived in Manila on 16 January 1897.Cf. 16 January 1897 issue of Diario de Manila. They were one of the largest native contingent to serve the government forces against Katipunan troops led by Emilio Aguinaldo, in the battlegrounds of Cavite province.Cf. Policarpio F. Hernadez, Iloilo, the Most Noble City: History and Development (1566-1898), p. 147. The Ilonggo volunteers established for themselves a distinguished combat record in Cavite. Once the Pact of Biak-na-Bato was signed, they returned to Iloilo. In April 1898 their homecoming, just like their departure, was met with much fanfare. This galvanized the Ilonggos into more public outpourings and manifestations of loyalty to Spain.Cf. 26 April 1898 issue of El Eco de Panay. Cf. also Policarpio F. Hernadez, Iloilo, the Most Noble City: History and Development (1566-1898), p. 147. Due to the loyalty of the Ilonggos, the city of Iloilo was honored with the perpetual title of Muy Noble. The Royal Decree granting this title was signed on 1 March 1898 by Queen Regent Maria Cristina.\\"Queriendo dar una prueba de Mi Real aprecio √° la ciudad de Ilo-Ilo por su honroso proceder con motivo de haber sido la primera que present√≥ voluntarios para combatir la insurrecci√≥n de Filipinas; a propuesta del Ministro de Ultramar, de acuerdo con Mi Consejo de Ministros; En Nombre de Mi augusto Hijo el Rey D. Alfonso XIII, y como Reina Regente del Reino, vengo en conceder √° dicha ciudad el dictado de ¬´Muy Noble¬ª, como recompensa √° su conducta y estimulo para el porvenir. Dado en Palacio √° primero de Marzo de mil ocho-cientos noventa y ocho.\\" These were the actual words (in Spanish) of the Royal Decree honoring the City with the title \\"Muy Noble\\" (Most Noble). Real Decreto de La Reina Regente Maria Cristina (Marzo 1, 1898) in Gaceta de Mardrid, No. 63, 4 Marzo 1898, p. 750. Over time, this title earned for Iloilo City the reputation of it being \\"The Queen's Favored City in the South\\" or simply \\"Queen's City in the South\\", being the second Spanish port of importance next to Manila, and being located South of the Archipelago's Capital. On a side note, at the beginning of the American period, Cebu became the second port of importance (Iloilo having been partly ravaged by bombardment, fire, and riot during the American occupation of Iloilo City). Yet, it was also during this period of Philippine history that Iloilo was more popularly known as the \\"Queen City of the South\\". This points to the fact that the moniker was associated to the Queen Regent's favor and to the honorary title granted to Iloilo City as Muy Noble Ciudad, due to the loyalty of its citizens to the Spanish Crown.Foreman, John, The Philippine Islands : a political, geographical, ethnographical, social and commercial history of the Philippine Archipelago, embracing the whole period of Spanish rule, with an account of the succeeding American insular government, New York: 1907, C. Scribner's Sons, pp. 518, 526. Besides, the Ilonggos, who were among the first allies of the Spanish Crown in the archipelago, contributed in the Spanish conquest of Luzon. It was in Arevalo (later, a district of Iloilo City), Panay that the conquest of Luzon was planned and launched, on 8 May 1570, with the help of seafaring inhabitants of the Island.Cf.

Modern day Plaza Libertad (formerly Plaza Alfonso XII [El Doceavo]) at night After the defeat of the Spanish forces at the Battle of Manila Bay during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the Capital of the Spanish East Indies was transferred to Iloilo, with General Diego de los Rios as the new Governor General residing in the city. A truce was declared between the American and the Spanish forces pending the negotiations of the joint commission of both warring Countries in Paris, France for the terms of peace. Meanwhile, General Aguinaldo sent several small vessels to Panay with Tagalog revolutionaries in order to stir up rebellion in the Visayas. He was anxious to secure all territories he could before the conditions for peace should be settled in Paris. At stake was the hope that actual possession of territories would influence the final decision.John, Foreman, The Philippine Islands : a political, geographical, ethnographical, social and commercial history of the Philippine Archipelago, embracing the whole period of Spanish rule, with an account of the succeeding American insular government, New York: 1907, C. Scribner's Sons, p. 474. By October 1898, fresh Tagalog expeditions were sent to Panay and coerced or persuaded its people to rise in greater force than ever, until finally, General de los Rios had to fall back to Iloilo. By the middle of November, after having secured the support of the inhabitants of the towns outside Iloilo through the leadership of General Mart√≠n Delgado, practically the whole island of Panay, except for the City Proper, Jaro, La Paz, and Molo, was under the revolutionary dominion. By December, de los Rios held only the city and port of Iloilo.John, Foreman, The Philippine Islands : a political, geographical, ethnographical, social and commercial history of the Philippine Archipelago, embracing the whole period of Spanish rule, with an account of the succeeding American insular government, New York: 1907, C. Scribner's Sons, p. 476. On 25 December 1898 (fifteen days after the signing of the Treaty of Paris on 10 December),John, Foreman, The Philippine Islands : a political, geographical, ethnographical, social and commercial history of the Philippine Archipelago, embracing the whole period of Spanish rule, with an account of the succeeding American insular government, New York: 1907, C. Scribner's Sons, p. 478. the Spanish government surrendered to the Ilonggo revolutionaries at Plaza Alfonso XII (Plaza Libertad today). Military Provincial Governor Ricardo Monet, who was representing Governor General de los Rios, together with Lt. Col. Agust√≠n Sol√≠s, formally handed over Plaza Alfonso XII to Delgado, who represented Emilio Aguinaldo, president of the newly established Philippine Republic, in Iloilo. Delgado was named provincial governor afterwards. The newly found freedom of the Ilonggos would be short- lived. The American forces arrived in Iloilo on 27 December 1898, under the command of General Marcus P. Miller, and were afterwards reinforced up to a total strength of about 3,000 troops and two ships,John, Foreman, The Philippine Islands : a political, geographical, ethnographical, social and commercial history of the Philippine Archipelago, embracing the whole period of Spanish rule, with an account of the succeeding American insular government, New York: 1907, C. Scribner's Sons, p. 477. to take possession of the territory in accordance with the Treaty of Paris. Filipino‚ÄìAmerican War After the Spanish forces left the city, the revolutionary forces made a formal entry amidst music and banners. A government was constituted. On 17 January 1899, an election placed Raymundo Melliza, of a notable family from Molo that was respected by both the natives and foreigners, to office as Mayor. However, the influence of the new regime established by the government of Aguinaldo did not have effective extent far beyond a day's march from the Capital. At the threshold of the City and Province of Iloilo, the Americans were waiting for signal from Manila. Two more ships supplemented the U.S. forces, even though no clashes with the revolutionaries took place after the Spaniards abandoned the city. Miller expressed demands for the surrender of Iloilo but no gun was fired. The Americans were waiting for the right moment, for it was not until 6 February 1899 that the American Senate ratified the Treaty of Paris.John, Foreman, The Philippine Islands: a political, geographical, ethnographical, social and commercial history of the Philippine Archipelago, embracing the whole period of Spanish rule, with an account of the succeeding American insular government, New York: 1907, C. Scribner's Sons, pp. 511-512. On 4 February, hostilities broke out between Aguinaldo's forces and the Americans in Luzon. Emissaries brought Aguinaldo's message to the Ilonggos to hold the City against the enemies. The demand for surrender was renewed by Miller, on 7 February, upon receipt of orders from Manila, with the threat to bombard Iloilo by the 12th day of the month if no surrender would take place.John, Foreman, The Philippine Islands: a political, geographical, ethnographical, social and commercial history of the Philippine Archipelago, embracing the whole period of Spanish rule, with an account of the succeeding American insular government, New York: 1907, C. Scribner's Sons, p. 513. Mart√≠n Teofilo Delgado marching in 1901 ahead of 30 officers and 140 men to surrender to Brig. Gen. Robert P. Hughes, regional commander of the US imperialist forces occupying the country As the Americans were preparing to attack the city, the 1,650 native troops under General Martin Delgado became uncontrollable and insolent to their officers. They were promised a monthly remuneration of Php4 and food, but only received Php1. Threats of mutiny, sacking and burning of the city, forced the Generals to collect money from the towns of Panay in order to appease the Visayan contingents. The same thing happened to the Tagalog component of the troops. The danger of riots in the city and the attitude of native soldiers fomented fear among the inhabitants. Chinese merchants closed their stores leaving only a small hole for transacting business. Many prominent families, who were in constant fear for their safety, went over to Negros Island in small schooners that flew the Philippine flag, without having any trouble with the American ships on standby in the waters between the two islands. On 10 February, an Extraordinary Session at the City Hall discussed plans for the impending bombardment of the city. There was a proposal to burn Iloilo, but the Mayor protested to this barbarous plan. A majority in the meeting was in favor of burning, which was seen as an invitation to despoil, lay waste and slay. The instigators who had no property interests in Iloilo, but who were so jealous of those who have, found a ready response of the Tagalog mercenaries, who had no local attachment to the city.John, Foreman, The Philippine Islands : a political, geographical, ethnographical, social and commercial history of the Philippine Archipelago, embracing the whole period of Spanish rule, with an account of the succeeding American insular government, New York: 1907, C. Scribner's Sons, p. 515. The Americans fired the first shell on 11 February 1899. Foreign eyewitnesses observed that the bombardment damaged quite a few buildings. In the meantime, from early morning, the withdrawing native soldiers, followed by a riffraff mob, were observed to have rushed hither and thither, throwing firebrands on to petroleum-washed houses. The Chinese had to barricade themselves to no use since fire burned their bazaars. Europeans and the Spanish half-castes had to defend themselves with every means possible, including bribing the rioters with a few pesos. Two British warships in the roadstead sent boats ashore and landed a party of marines, who made a gallant effort to save foreign properties, as the United Kingdom had a strong business interest in Iloilo and a Consulate. By 1 o'clock of the same day, the Americans made a landing and restored order. Sentinels were stationed to protect what still remained of the townspeople's goods. In due course, indemnity claims were forwarded to the American military authorities, but were all rejected.John, Foreman, The Philippine Islands : a political, geographical, ethnographical, social and commercial history of the Philippine Archipelago, embracing the whole period of Spanish rule, with an account of the succeeding American insular government, New York: 1907, C. Scribner's Sons, p. 516. Ten years later, an article published in the local paper Nuevo Heraldo summarized the downfall of the Queen City in these words: \\"The fire left behind only the name Iloilo, as the main part of the city was reduced to ashes by the retreating Ilongo troops. That event was the cause of the ruin of such a beautiful city, second only to Manila, where, if there was not a surplus of money, neither the people's welfare was wanting, and life was prosperous and peaceful. If the brain who planted such an unqualified act had measured the consequences... maybe he would never have dared doing it...\\"Nuevo Heraldo, Iloilo, 11 February 1908. By February 1899, the Americans had started mobilizing to colonize anew the City and Province. They continued to meet resistance from the Ilonggos, which lasted up to 1901. In which case, Iloilo was also among the last cities to fall to Americans. Many leaders surrendered to the new regime and were reintegrated to the Ilonggo society without conditions. Among them was General Martin Delgado, who accepted the position of Governor of the Province of Iloilo from 1901 to 1904, under the American flag. He was, at that time, the highest paid Governor in the whole Archipelago, receiving $3,000 gold annually.The San Francisco Call, 12 April 1901, p. 2. Local government was established in some towns of Iloilo by 11 April 1901. Jose Maria Gay was appointed Alcalde, Matias Hibiernas was teniente alcalde of Iloilo;Jose Yusay was President of Molo; Pablo Borromeo was President of Arevalo; Ruperto Montinola was the lone representative of Jaro, but was not its president; Madurriao's president was Emigdio Mesa. Emilio Magbanua was appointed its police delegate. It was observed by Juan de Leon, judge of the Court of First Instance that there existed a rivalry between the pueblos of Iloilo, Jaro and Molo, which are adjacent to and are only half an hour travel by carriage from each other. Besides, Molo and Jaro are residential pueblos, and Iloilo was the business town for both. It was also recommended that Arevalo be joined to Molo, and La Paz to Jaro. The aggregate population of these territories was at 100,000 in 1901.Annual report of the Philippine Commission / Bureau of Insular Affairs, War Department to the President of the United States, Washington D.C.: 1901, Vol. I, p. 130. Presidents and other representatives were also appointed for the towns of Alimodian, Miag-ao, Janiuay, Mina, Oton, Passi, Guimbal, Pototan, San Joaquin, Santa Barbara, San Miguel, Pavia, Sara, Nagaba (currently known as Nueva Valencia), San Enrique, Lambunao, Cordoba (a barangay of Tigbauan today), Cabatuan, Leganes, Tigbauan, Banate, Buena Vista, Navalas, Tubungan, Duenas, Mandurriao, Maasin, Lucena, and Leon. Other formerly existing ones, like Anilao and Barotac Viejo, were fused with other towns. As the aftermath of the revolution and the Filipino‚ÄìAmerican War, it was clear to all the most sober-minded and best educated Ilonggos that Aguinaldo's government was a failure in Panay at least. Visayans of position, with property interests at stake, were convinced that absolute independence without any control or protection from some established political power was premature and doomed to disaster. The Visayan grudge against the Tagalog predominance was also a factor that contributed to the failure of Aguinaldo's government. But the aggravating factor was the dictatorial air and brutal conduct of the Tagalog troops, which destroyed the theory of fraternal unity.John, Foreman, The Philippine Islands : a political, geographical, ethnographical, social and commercial history of the Philippine Archipelago, embracing the whole period of Spanish rule, with an account of the succeeding American insular government, New York: 1907, C. Scribner's Sons, pp. 516-517. Ananias Diocno, the Tagalog contingents' leader known for severity in his Capiz and Iloilo campaigns, left a lasting non-commendable remembrance in the history of Panay.N.B.

American colonial era (1900‚Äì1941)  Central Philippine University was founded in 1905 through a grant given by the American industrialist, oil magnate and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller, by the Baptist American missionaries; it is the first Baptist- founded and second American university in the Philippines and in Asia. In 1900, the Americans reverted the city's status into a township. By virtue of Act No. 719 of 1903, the municipalities of Jaro, La Paz, Mandurriao, and Molo, were incorporated into the municipality of Iloilo. Pavia was also incorporated into Iloilo from Santa Barbara by virtue of Act No. 1333 19 April 1905. Later, Executive Order No. 64 24 December 1907 separated Pavia and Jaro from Iloilo and constituted them as the municipality of Jaro with effect on 15 February 1908.Executive Order No. 64 24 December 1907, see La Paz was re-established as a separate municipality in 1920 by virtue of Executive Order No. 70 signed on 11 October 1919. The Americans initiated the construction of the Baluarte and Arroyo streets, the extension of Delgado Street to Valeria and from Fuentes and Jalandoni streets up to the present-day U.P. in the Visayas. Quezon and Mabini streets were asphalted while their sidewalks were also constructed. More significant was the installation of streetlights all throughout the city in 1921. In 1926, the widening of important streets, like General Luna, J.M. Basa and Ledesma, was started. In 1927, an improved street, Valeria-Ledesma (formerly known as Weyler), was inaugurated (David 1937). Colegio de San Agust√≠n During the American colonial regime that time in the Philippine islands, the Americans brought with them their faith, the Protestantism. A comity agreement was made in 1898 that the Philippine islands would be divided into different Protestant denominations for missionary works to avoid future conflicts; Iloilo is one of the first favored places in the country where the early Protestant sects came because of the city's economic prominence and importance next to Manila during such time.Guillermo & Verora, pp. 1‚Äì3 Western Visayas and Negros, in accordance with the comity agreement, was given to the religious jurisdictions of the Baptists, although other Protestant sects were allowed to do missions in the same area. The Protestant missionaries initiated large-scale enterprises in the predominantly Catholic province. The Presbyterians established the first Protestant and American hospital in the country, the Iloilo Mission Hospital. Supposedly it came also that Iloilo is the original location for foundation of Silliman University, the first Protestant and American university in the country and in Asia. However, due to the Catholic opposition where the school will stand, the founder, David Hibbard, prospected some new locations. He went to Cebu and later had a side trip in Dumaguete City, where he had a decision to establish and where Silliman University is presently located. Baptists on the other hand, established institutions like Central Philippine University in 1905, as the first Baptist-founded and second American university in Asia; the Jaro Evangelical Church, the first Baptist church in the Philippines; and the Convention of Philippine Baptist Churches, the oldest Baptist organizational body in the Philippines.The Convention of Philippine Baptist Churches, Inc. - is the oldest Baptist organizational body in the Philippines. Retrieved 19 October 2012 Later, the Seventh-day Adventists established the Jaro Adventist Center, the first organized Seventh-day Adventist church in the islands.

Central Philippine University pioneered the work-study program in the country which was later patterned and followed by other institutions and has also established the first and oldest student governing body in South East Asia modeled on the American civil government, the Central Philippine University Republic in 1906 after the Jaro Industrial School, CPU's forerunner, was established. Under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church in the United States in 1901, the Sabine Haines Memorial Union Mission Hospital (Union Mission Hospital) was established by American missionary doctor Joseph Andrew Hall and his wife Jane Russell Hall. The hospital is also the first hospital for soldiers and the constabulary (predecessor of the Philippine National Police) during the American colonial regime in the country. The hospital pioneered the nursing education in the country through the establishment of the Union Mission Hospital Training School for Nurses, the first nursing school in the Philippines. Later, the hospital was handed over to the Protestant Baptists. In 1931, the Union Mission Hospital moved to its present site in a property bought by the Baptists, thus a year later in 1932, the hospital changed its name to Iloilo Mission Hospital alongside with its nursing school. The school was later transferred and became and organic academic unit of the Central Philippine University (the present day Central Philippine University College of Nursing. Iloilo Mission Hospital has over the years associated with Central Philippine University as its university hospital (CPU-Iloilo Mission Hospital). Up to the present, the various evangelical Protestant denominations (composing around 2.8% of the Filipinos) and their educational institutions also serve Catholic students in Iloilo, who make up 83% of the population. St. Vincent Ferrer Seminary in Jaro, Iloilo City Seizure of friar lands and parishes and the above-mentioned Protestant activities gave the American and Filipino public an impression of an anti-Catholic stance of the U.S. occupation of the Islands during the first years of the American rule. The Taft Commission, the sole legislative body of the American government for the Philippines (then known as the Philippine Islands under the sovereign control of the United States) while still under the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, were attacked by Catholic press in New York for anti-Catholic bigotry. Soon, pressures from influential Catholics in the United States, and also in Ireland caused President Theodore Roosevelt to appoint a Catholic in the commission to defend Catholic interest in the Philippines. Influential Catholics in Manila followed suit. Worries about Catholic vote in national elections moved the civil government to send the commission to the Vatican to negotiate exploring workable to solutions to the Catholic question in the newly acquired territory. Before coming to Rome, the head of the Commission personally visited the Cardinal Archbishop of Baltimore.Frank T. Reuter, Catholic Influence on American Colonial Policies, 1898-1904, Austin: 2014, University of Texas Press, pp. 139-155. Pace by pace, acceptable solutions were employed. In 1902, the President of the United States of America commissioned two American Augustian friars to pioneer a movement to send American priests out to the Philippines to replace the Spanish friars,Frank T. Reuter, Catholic Influence on American Colonial Policies, 1898-1904, Austin: 2014, University of Texas Press, p. 151. who diminished in number (1,013 in 1898 to 246 in 1903) due to normal loss of personnel due to death or retirement, death caused by native hostilities, or voluntary return to Spain.Frank T. Reuter, Catholic Influence on American Colonial Policies, 1898-1904, Austin: 2014, University of Texas Press, p. 155. In Iloilo, American Catholics countered the Protestant American missions and the American Catholic bishops, like Frederick Rooker, Dennis Joseph Dougherty, and James McCloskey, were named for the Roman Catholic See of Jaro in Iloilo City. These bishops sustained the educational achievements of the Spanish friars by bringing in American and European Catholic missionaries, among whom were the Sisters of Charity of St. Paul, and Augustinian missionary priests. The Augustinians, who were the first to bring the Christian faith in the Philippines as well as in Panay island, and who built the centuries-old heritage churches in this island,Cf. Fr. Juan Fernandez, O.S.A, Monografias de los pueblos de la isla de Panay in Monographs of the Towns of Panay, Jose Espinosa, Jr., trans., Iloilo City: University of San Augustine, 2006 established the Collegio de San Agust√≠n in 1904, which eventually became the only university of the Augustinian Order in Asia. During the American regime, their confreres from the United States developed evermore this institution, which later became the first university in Iloilo. The American Catholic Bishops also maintained and upgraded the St. Vincent Ferrer Seminary (established in 1869 as the Collegio-Seminario de San Vicente Ferrer), which was the first institution of higher learning in Western Visayas. Despite the Augustinians being Catholics and Baptists being Protestants, they mutually enriched each other through dialogue mainly because Augustinian ideals were the foundations of Protestantism since the first Protestant was Martin Luther and he was a former Augustinian priest himself and the Protestant zeal for reformation from corruption even started some reform in the church itself. Saint Ezekiel Moreno who was ordained in the Minor Orders in Jaro, Iloilo had walked the fine line between reform, obedience and leadership since he ministered and walked hand in hand with condemned rebels and criminals in the Iwahig Prison and Penal Farm, he was also obedient to his superiors in the Order of Augustinian Recollects, a reform or \\"Recollection\\" movement in the Augustinian Order, which took elements from the Protestant Reformation. Saint Ezekiel Moreno also became the leader of a political movement when he became a Bishop of Pasto, Colombia.http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/revistas/credencial/octubre1993/octubre2.htm The visitation of Saint Ezekiel Moreno is a harmonized incarnation of the ancient Conviv√®ncia in Spain when different religions and kingdoms; Pagan, Christian, Jewish and Muslim lived side by side and struggled to maintain their perspective purity, contested with each other and yet also mutually enriched each other without turning into a mongrelized melting pot of a mixed up and confused morass. Coincidentally, Saint Ezekiel Moreno was ordained in the Minor Orders in the then church of Jaro which housed a Virgin Mary statue under the Title of \\"Nuestra Se√±ora de la Candelaria de Jaro\\". An image with complex Conviv√®ncia alluding properties due to the confluence of many symbols from various cultures simultaneously present in the image but it is likely not earthly of nature and is a pure grace direct from heaven or an image \\"Not carved by human hands\\" due to its miraculous nature which was found floating in a river, shifting in weight and growing in size. A market in Iloilo, in the 1910s The Paulinian Sisters took charge of St. Paul Hospital, originally owned by the Catholic Diocese of Jaro. Bishop Dennis Joseph Dougherty, who later became Cardinal Archbishop of Philadelphia, gave the medical facilities to the Sisters. To commemorate the bishop's generosity, the hospital named a more recent section of the facilities after him: the CADMA (Cardinal Dougherty Medical Annex). To meet the growing need to provide nurses for their hospital, the Paulinians also opened a nursing school. Today, this institution has also become a university (St. Paul University Iloilo), and has ever since supplied high-quality healthcare professionals known worldwide for their skills and dedication to work. St. Paul Hospital c. 1920 During the American colonial occupation, one of the platforms by the colonial government was first to establish and implement a public education system in the islands and the Thomasites were deployed and commissioned by the American government to teach in the public schools that will be established. The Thomasites tolerated religious freedom, which is one of the foundations of the United States constitution and legacy to the Philippines, while commissioned and under their tutelage to teach in public schools during the colonial period. Public schools that were established when the Thomasites came to Iloilo are Iloilo Normal School, the present-day West Visayas State University (formally established in 1924 but dates back its founding in 1902 as part of the Philippine Normal School System in the Philippines); the Iloilo National High School, the first public provincial high school in the islands; and Baluarte Elementary School, the first public elementary school in the islands. Commonwealth Act No. 57 was passed in 1936 granting city status to Iloilo; this charter was immediately amended by Commonwealth Act No. 158 some days later to incorporate the municipalities of La Paz and Arevalo as part of the new city's territory. Iloilo regained cityhood status on 16 July 1937, through Commonwealth Act 158. Incorporated as part of Iloilo City were the towns of La Paz and Ar√©valo and inaugurated on 25 August 1937. The municipality of Jaro, on the other hand, was incorporated into Iloilo City some years later by virtue of Commonwealth Act No. 604 22 August 1940, which amended the city charter of Iloilo to include, into Iloilo City, the municipality of Jaro \\"on the date that the President of the Philippines may set by proclamation\\". To that effect, President Manuel L. Quezon issued Proclamation No. 663 on 7 January 1941, giving 16 January as the date of Jaro's incorporation into Iloilo City. Sugar's demand was declining, labor unrests in the port area scared the investors away, and the opening of the sub-port of Pulupandan in Negros Occidental moved the sugar importation closer to the sugar farms. Japanese occupation (1942‚Äì1945) Central Philippine University's main campus north- eastern side aerial view in the 1960s. During the onset of World War II, Central's entire properties on its main campus were heavily destroyed. The war torned university's main campus was rebuilt after the post-war, resulting for a well-laid campus plan dotted with palm and acacia trees and home to a plethora of century old colonial American heritage structures built in early 1900s. By 1942, the Japanese invaded Panay and the economy moved into a standstill. During World War II, Iloilo was controlled by several Japanese battalions. Japan's ultimate goal was to entrench itself deeply into the Philippines so that at the close of the war they could occupy it just as the Spanish and the Americans had years before. When Iloilo was liberated by Filipino and American forces from Japanese military occupation on 25 March 1945, the remnants of these battalions were held in Jaro Plaza as a makeshift detention facility.  Post-war decline  The war heavily damaged the infrastructure in Iloilo. However, the continuing conflict between the labor unions in the port area, declining sugar economy, and the deteriorating peace and order situation in the countryside, the exodus of Ilonggos to other cities, provinces/regions and islands that offered better opportunities and business. People were moving to other cities such as Bacolod, Cebu, and Manila that led to Iloilo's decline in economic importance in central Philippines. Rural agricultural areas continued to help the local economy. For years, because of this exodus of investors, Iloilo's economy progressed in a moderate pace. Change slowly came. First came the construction of the fishing port and a new international seaport. One by one, commercial business firms invested in Iloilo, spurring on the city to its eventual recovery. Iloilo became a highly urbanized city in 1979 by the virtue of Batas Pambansa Blg. 51. Corollary to this new status, its residents effectively lost their eligibility to vote for provincial officials.  21st century and economic boom  After the opening of the new commercial and business center in Mandurriao district and with the construction of a national highway that traverses this area, big businesses like the SM Supermalls, SM Prime Holdings, Megaworld Corporation, Gaisano Capital, and Ayala Corporation poured in huge investments in the city, giving impetus and catalyst toward future progress.  Geography  Iloilo City is located in the southern shores of Panay Island. The city faces Iloilo Strait and Guimaras Island across it, making it a natural harbor and a safe anchorage for ships. It is bordered by the towns of Oton in the west, Pavia in the north and Leganes in the northeast. Just across the Iloilo Strait in its eastern and southern coastlines, are the towns of Buenavista and Jordan in the island- province of Guimaras. The city lies on a flat alluvial plain, reclaimed mostly from the swampy areas due to urbanization and industrialization in the late 19th century until the present. Traversing the city are the rivers of Iloilo, Batiano, Jaro and Dungon Creek. Iloilo River is an estuary that separates the districts of City Proper, Molo and Villa Arevalo from the rest of the city. On the other hand, Jaro River is fed by its tributary rivers, Aganan and Tigum. Lately, a new escape channel for floodwaters coming from these two rivers to Iloilo Straight was developed, the Jaro Floodway. Iloilo City is from Manila, from Roxas City, from Kalibo, and from San Jose de Buenavista. The city has a total land area of . The city is divided into seven geographical districts. All of the districts were once individual towns, excluding Lapuz, which was a sub-district of La Paz until 2008. All districts have their own town centers complete with a plaza, a Roman Catholic church, a fire station, a police station and a public market. City Proper is a commercial area and the political center of the city and the Province of Iloilo and the Regional Government Center of Western Visayas. Iloilo City is the center of the only officially recognized Metropolitan Area in Western Visayas. The metropolitan area is composed of the City of Iloilo, the municipalities of Leganes, Pavia, Santa Barbara, Cabatuan, San Miguel, Oton, the Island Province of Guimaras and its five municipalities, namely - Sibunag, San Lorenzo, Nueva Valencia, Buenavista and Jordan. The city of Iloilo has only one legislative district and is subdivided into 180 barangays (barrios). Climate Iloilo City has a tropical wet and dry climate as according to the K√∂ppen climate classification system, with pronounced wet season from June throughout November; then dry season from December to May. Demographics= Language  Hiligaynon is the dominant language of Iloilo City. English is used as the language of business and education. In addition, other local languages such as Karay-a (also known as Kinaray-a or obsolete Haraya) is also spoken. Spanish, once widely spoken during the colonial era up to the 1980s, is dying out, though a broken Spanish creole is spoken by a few of some Spanish-blood families and elderly sugar barons. Hiligaynon is spoken in Panay, Guimaras and Negros islands, and is part of the Visayan language family of the Malayo- Polynesian languages. Because Iloilo was a former Spanish colony for 300 years, Hiligaynon is heavily influenced by the Spanish language with a plethora of loaned words (Guerra, Puerta, Golpe, Aguanta, Puerto, Calle, and Edificio, among others). Hiligaynon is mainly concentrated in the provinces of Iloilo, Guimaras and Negros Occidental. The language is referred to as \\"Ilonggo\\" () in Iloilo and Negros Occidental. More precisely, \\"Ilonggo\\" is the ethno-linguistic group referring to the inhabitants of Iloilo and the culture associated with native Hiligaynon speakers. The distinction between the terms, Ilonggo and Hiligaynon, is unclear however, as most of the townspeople are claiming that Hiligaynon is the language being spoken and Ilonggo is a term used to refer a person living in Iloilo or its associated culture and ethnicity.  Religion  Jaro Cathedral (Catedral de Jaro/Catedral Metropolitana de Jaro) or National Shrine of Our Lady of Candles which is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Jaro is one of the largest Roman Catholic Archdioceses in the Philippines. The present Archdiocese of Capiz, the islands of Palawan and Mindoro and Zamboanga were former parts of its ecclesiastical jurisdiction before they became a separate bishopric. As the second National Shrine in the Visayas (first in Western Visayas and first Marian dedicated church to do so outside Luzon), Jaro Cathedral is likewise widely known as the seat of Roman Catholicism in Western Visayas. Jose Romeo O. Lazo, the incumbent Roman Catholic Archbishop of Jaro. Iloilo City is one of the notable centers of faith in the Philippines. Due to the heavy Spanish Missions, the city's population is predominant Catholic with over 95% belonging to the Roman Catholic Church. Other religious minorities such as Protestants (5%), Iglesia NI Cristo(2%) and Aglipayans (1%) (also a form of Episcopal Protestantism) have a significant presence at the city. The former city of Jaro (one of the present districts (boroughs) of Iloilo city) is the seat of bishopric and pioneer Christian institutions not only in Western Visayas but in the whole Philippines established through the Spanish colonization. The Spaniards which brought the Catholic faith established the Roman Catholic metropolitan see of the Archdiocese of Jaro with its diocesan cathedral while the Americans which brought the Protestantism established the Convention of Philippine Baptist Churches (the first and oldest Baptist churches organization in the Philippines), the Jaro Evangelical Church (the first Baptist church in the Philippine islands), and Jaro Adventist Center (first organized Adventist church in the Philippines). The Roman Catholic Archdiocese is one of the oldest and largest bishopric sees in the country. It was established as a parish in 1587 initially covering Catmon, Cabatuan and Maasin . It was created a diocese by virtue of a papal bull of Pope Pius IX on 27 May 1865 . It has jurisdiction over sufragan bishops of Mindoro, Palawan, Zamboanga, the provinces of Iloilo, Negros Oriental, Guimaras, San Jose de Buenavista, Capiz, Bacolod, San Carlos and Kabankalan in Negros Occidental. It lost some of its territory to establish the Diocese of Zamboanga and Apostolic Prefecture of Palawan. Much later, three other ecclesiastical jurisdictions were established from parts of its territory: Diocese of Bacolod (15 July 1932), Apostolic Prefecture of Mindoro (2 July 1936), and Diocese of Capiz (27 January 1951). The diocese was elevated into a Metropolitan Archdiocese by Pope Pius XII. Later, on 24 March 1962, it lost further some of its territory that resulted to the establishment the Territorial Prelature of San Jose de Antique (but still a part of it at present). Jaro Evangelical Church, the first Baptist Church in the Philippines (second Protestant Church in the Philippines and first Protestant Church outside Manila in the Philippines both after the Central United Methodist Church (Manila) (1899)) by the Northern American Baptists. The Jaro Cathedral (National Shrine of the Our Lady of Candles) is the seat of the Archdiocese of Jaro. Saint Elizabeth of Hungary and the Our Lady of Candles are the official Catholic patronesses of the Archdiocese. The Nuestra Se√±ora de la Candelaria or Our Lady of the Candles is the official patron of the whole Western Visayas and Romblon. Being designated as a National Shrine, Jaro Cathedral is likewise widely known as the seat of Roman Catholicism in Western Visayas. The said designation (National Shrine) by the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines is the first of its kind in the region, the second in Western Visayas (after Cebu), and the first Marian dedicated church outside of Luzon. Protestantism forms as the second largest faith in the City of Iloilo. Protestant sects was brought by the Americans when the Philippines was ceded to the American rule by Spain through the 1898 Treaty of Paris. The said faith brought by the United States in the heavily Roman Catholic Iloilo has gained adherents and still continues to grow at present. Iloilo which is one of the pioneering places in the country that Protestants set foot is strongly contributed due to its economic importance in the international scene in the early 1900s. The American colonial government tolerated religious freedom that even to this day Iloilo is still a predominantly Catholic. Presbyterians and Baptists are among the first Protestant sects that arrived in Iloilo. The arrival of American brand of Protestant denominations resulted to the establishment of notable pioneering institutions in Iloilo. The Presbyterians established the Iloilo Mission Hospital in 1901 (the first American and Protestant hospital in the Philippines) while Baptists established the American John D. Rockefeller funded Central Philippine University in 1905 (the first Baptist and second American university in the Philippines and in Asia), Jaro Evangelical Church in 1900 (the first Baptist church in the Philippines and also the first Protestant church outside Manila (2nd in the Philippines after the Central United Methodist Church in Manila), and the Convention of Philippine Baptist Churches (the first and oldest Baptist churches organization in the Philippines). The Seventh-day Adventists did not join the comity agreement with the early Protestant sects for jurisdictional division on the Philippine islands for missionary works, because they wanted to go to any parts of the country. They arrived years later following the advent of Protestant missions in the Philippines in the early 1900s in Iloilo. Their arrival resulted to the founding of Jaro Adventist Center, the first organized Seventh-day Adventist church in the Philippines. There are other Christian sects such as Iglesia ni Cristo and Church of Christ of Latter Day Saints or Mormon and communities of non-Christian sects like Islam which brought by Muslim-Filipinos from the south, Sikhism by the Indian immigrants, and Taoism and Buddhism which brought by Chinese immigrants.

Iloilo City has a multitude of districts, each with its distinctive character and representing colonial influence. Iloilo's other distinctive features include its cityscape surrounded with water features such us rivers and is bounded by a sea; bicycle paths and ornamental trees that line most city streets; and its many open spaces, gardens and parks.

The two main rivers of Iloilo and Batiano snakes through the city and empties out of the Iloilo-Guimaras Strait. Iloilo is a conglomerate of former separate towns which includes the former city of Jaro established during the Spanish colonial times, thus the layout of the towns civic centers follows a typical Spanish colonial town center composed of a Plaza (Public Square), church, municipal hall and other religious, academic and government instrumentalities offices. A modern development is clustered in an organized form in the city's premises but is strongly concentrated in the Mandurriao district to protect the city's initiatives in protecting the city's skyline, heritage zones and environment. Present modern developments spread out outside the city in neighboring towns that are a part of Metropolitan Iloilo. Architecture Nelly's Garden or Lopez Mansion (Mansion de Lopez) in Jaro is regaled as the \\"Queen of all Heritage Houses in Western Visayas\\". Iloilo City's urban planning and architecture reflect the plans of the Spanish and the American colonial administrations. Since Iloilo City is a conglomeration of towns, the districts have their own plazas which are surrounded by establishments of political and ecclesiastical influence, such as churches and old administrative halls. In 1930, Juan M. Arellano of the Bureau of Public Works designed the schematic plan for Iloilo City, which was influenced by Ebenezer Howard's \\"Garden City.\\" Beaux-Arts Villa Lizares (Lizares Mansion) in the town of Jaro. The Spanish colonial influence is strongly imprinted not only in Iloilo's history and cultural background but also the architectural perspective. The city's regaled status during the Spanish colonial era until the turn of the 20th century is implied during by the sugar boom with ubiquitous stately mansions and edifices built by the old money Ilonggo Sugar Baron and elite families which contrast to the city's economic importance as a second city next to Manila during the said era in the Philippines. The city's other moniker ‚Äì ‚Äò‚ÄôCity of Mansions‚Äô‚Äô is likewise implied because Iloilo holds 240 mansions in which 30 of it are grand mansions built during the Spanish and American colonial eras. Campanario de Jaro (Jaro Belfry), one of the few free standing bell towers in the Philippines that is detached from the church. The ravaged ‚Äò‚ÄôFuerte de San Pedro‚Äô‚Äô (Fort San Pedro) is Iloilo‚Äôs ground zero as there was no Iloilo City back in the 1600s. As a fortress, Fort San Pedro was built solely by the Spaniards to protect Iloilo from the marauding pirates and privateers. The fort is the second Spanish built fort after the one in Cebu (also Fort San Pedro) in the Philippines and Asia. The foundation of the Fort San Pedro was substantial to the Spanish Empire‚Äôs stronghold as Panay Island with Iloilo as their second colonial center established through the Iloilo precursor towns of Oton (1566) and La Villa Rica de Arevalo (1581). Oton which was founded as early as 1566 but formally established in 1572 was the actual second seat of Spanish colonial powers but due to pirate attacks, they moved the capital eastward and established the ‚Äò‚ÄôLa Villa Rica de Arevalo‚Äô‚Äô. The town of La Villa Rica de Arevalo holds some of the fine example of Spanish built mansions like the mansion of the Spanish Governor General, but were destroyed when the pirates ransacked and destroyed the town. It was in the said frequent events of pirate attacks that the Spaniards moved finally the capital further eastward in the mouth of ‚Äò‚ÄôRio de Iloilo‚Äô‚Äô (Iloilo River) which is flanked and protected by Guimaras Island across it. Casa de Emperador in Iloilo Business Park, an example of modern built classical styled edifice. It was in the said establishment of the city on the mouth of Iloilo River that as years go by, the city flourished to its heights especially in the economic and regal importance in the Spanish and American eras. La Villa Rica de Arevalo (Arevalo) is the first Spanish named town in the Philippine islands. It is also in Arevalo that the third oldest image of Holy Child Jesus (Se√±or Santo Ni√±o) in the Philippines was brought by the Spaniards. Notable present day structures that are repositories that attest to the town's former glory as a Spanish precursor town of Iloilo is the mansion of Balay Cami√±a na Bato and the Convento de Arevalo. During the Spanish and American eras, the city developed its own unique charm that exudes a typical European city in the east which differed it from other cities just like the old Manila in the Philippines. It was in the said eras that architectural perspective of Iloilo flourished with European styled edifices and stately mansions was built which stands of Iloilo's once economic and political importance in its heyday.

Two of notable mansions that attest to Jaro‚Äôs importance as an old rich town that developed out of the sugar boom during the Spanish colonial period is the Mansion de Lopez (Lopez Mansion) or Nelly Garden and the beaux-art styled Villa Lizares (Lizares Mansion) which houses at present the Angelicum School Iloilo of the Dominicans. Religion is also a crucial factor that influenced Jaro‚Äôs architectural and town plan perspective as it is the cradle of Christian faith in Western Visayas. The Spanish which brought the Roman Catholic faith established the Jaro Cathedral (National Shrine of the Our Lady Candles) with its separate belfry located across it (one of the few churches in the Philippines with a detached belfry) and the Seminario-Colegio de San Vicente Ferrer (the first institution of Higher Learning in Western Visayas). The advent of American colonialization which brought Protestantism has resulted also to the establishment of institutions.

Tertulia also means an informal meeting of people to talk about current affairs, arts, etc. The word is originally Spanish (borrowed by Catalan and Portuguese), but it has only moderate currency in English, used mainly in describing Latin cultural contexts. Format A tertulia is rather similar to a salon, but a typical tertulia in recent centuries has been a regularly scheduled event in a public place such as a bar, although some tertulias are held in more private spaces, such as someone's living room. Participants, known as contertulios, may share their recent creations such as poetry, short stories, other writings, and even artwork or songs. Usually, but not always, the participants in a regularly scheduled tertulia are in some respects like-minded, with similar political or literary tastes. Etymology Philip II of Spain, in the 16th century, was very interested in the ancient world and its cultures. Within his court, he employed polymaths such as Juan de Mal Lara to compose poetry to accompany artworks which enriched his various palaces. Of great interest to the king were the works of the Christian author Quintus Septimius Florens Tertullianus. Courtiers and academics would gather to discuss such works with their royal patron, and so tertulia emerged as a term for learned discussion. In the Spanish colonies At tertulias before 1810 in at the houses of Buenos Aires society women such as Mercedes de Lasalde Riglos, Mariquita S√°nchez de Thompson and Flora Azcu√©naga the discussions led up to the May Revolution, the first stage in the struggle for Argentine independence from Spain. \\"Madame Riglos\\" could be seen as the chief lady of the Tory (conservative) faction in Buenos Aires. She was sparkling and familiar, although highly aristocratic. Do√±a Melchora de Sarratea, queen of fashion and of the Buenos Aires salons, was so well aware of public and private affairs that she was held to be an enthusiastic supporter of Whig (liberal) principles. Mariquita S√°nchez de Thompson's forte was foreign relations. Similar tertulias were being held during this period in Lima, Peru, by women such as Manuela R√°bago de Avellafuertes de Riglos and Narcisa Arias de Saavaedra. Jos√© Antonio Wilde (1813‚Äì87) described Buenos Aires in the period immediately following independence. He wrote that it was a widespread custom among the more notable and well-to-do families, and also with many decent families, to give tertulias at least once a week. Usually the guests danced only from 8:00 to 12:00 at night, in which case only mate was served, but if it went on later chocolate would be added. Dress was not elaborate, and dancing, music and conversation were the only entertainment, so the cost was low. A piano player might be hired, or the young people might play dance pieces, or some old and complacent aunt might play some contradanza. Even if it was old, the thing was to dance.

The series was created by Dan Gordon, and was produced by Don Simpson/Jerry Bruckheimer Films (the company's first venture into television) and Rysher Entertainment. During the first season, the show dealt with terrorists and drug lords, and often tackled issues such as patriotism and self-sacrifice. The primary cast included Brad Johnson, Tim Abell, Melinda Clarke, R√©al Andrews, Mark Sheppard, and David Selby. For the second season, the show was renamed SOF: Special Ops Force. Andrews and Sheppard left the show. Dennis Rodman and David Eigenberg replaced them, though their \\"hip\\" characters and new plots led many to abandon the show, leading to its cancellation. The theme song was performed by Trevor Rabin. During the second season, an introductory voice-over by an uncredited Peter Graves was added.  Cast of characters = Season 1  * Brad Johnson - Major Matthew Quentin Shepherd (former U.S. Army Special Forces; counter-terrorism, special recon, unconventional warfare, infiltration, edged weapons) Maj. Shepherd grew up in southern California, the son of a United States Navy A-6 pilot who was MIA during the Vietnam War. Shepherd would later graduate from The Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina. It was there that he excelled at various edge weapons ranging from Japanese short sword, to a sharpened deck of cards. After he graduated, he received a commission in the United States Army, where he served as a platoon leader at the 82nd Airborne Division and was qualified as a member of both the Army Rangers and the Army's Special Forces. It was during this time that he became an expert in infiltration, and small team tactics. Later he would become an expert in counter-terrorism when he joined the elite Delta Force. He would show signs of natural leadership and was promoted to the rank of Major. While on a peacekeeping mission in the former Yugoslavia, Maj. Shepherd disobeyed a direct order and returned for an injured soldier under his command. This was the first time he would deliver his code \\"Everybody comes home.\\" Shortly after the rescue the soldier died in Maj. Shepherd's arms, but Maj. Shepherd didn't feel that the rescue attempt was a waste because he got to return the body to the young man's family. After this incident, the Army nearly court-martialled Maj. Shepherd for disobeying a direct order; however, they instead accepted his resignation. Despite the discharge, he continued to have the respect of his fellow soldiers. Following his discharge he would be recruited by Xavier Trout, to go on one mission for the U.S. government inside Iraq. Trout felt that the mission would offer the government plausible deniability because none of his team would be connected as active duty soldiers to an actual government. If captured, Maj. Shepherd and his team would have been executed as spies, so Trout offered them one million dollars if they were successful. Maj. Shepherd then recruited six others for his mission, Benny Ray Riddle, Margo Vincent, Chance Walker, C.J. Yates, Gunter Hauer and Rico Valesquez. The team would complete the mission but not before the death of Hauer and the injuring of Valesquez. Instead of taking the million dollars, Maj. Shepherd would ask Trout give the money to Hauer's family and help pay for Valesquez's physical rehabilitation. He would submit a bill for their services and would continue to accept missions like the previous one for the government. As a cover, Maj. Shepherd runs a bar and grill called the Silver Star. The Silver Star had a secret room in which Maj. Shepherd and his team would meet to plan missions, and store weapons, supplies and spare money. * Tim Abell - Staff Sergeant Benny Ray Riddle (former U.S. Marine; scout sniper, armorer) Benny Ray Riddle enlisted in the United States Marine Corps right out of high school. Because he was from Alabama, he received his training at Parris Island. Upon the completion of training Riddle would be accepted into the elite Scout Snipers, where he became a skilled marksman, a member of Marine Force Reconnaissance, and expert in a variety of firearms. Riddle would eventually be promoted to Staff Sergeant. While on a United Nations peacekeeping mission SSgt. Riddle refused a direct order from a UN officer. He believed that as an American, he should not take a direct order from a foreign officer. The Marine Corps disagreed, and he would be court- martialed and discharged from the Marines. When Maj. Shepherd recruited him, he was employed teaching target shooting at a private shooting range. Riddle is divorced and has three children. One of which is a son named Billy, who he likes to have \\"man-to-man talks\\" while they are fishing. Riddle was known for not being very talkative, and was sometimes teased by his teammates as being a little bit obsessive. For example, he doesn't use any scented, detergents, soaps or shampoo, on the theory that it might give away his position to the enemy. Benny Ray is usually seen driving around in his beloved Harley Davidson motorcycle. He also is a huge fan of country music. In the first-season finale, C.J. and Chance were wondering what they would miss if they bought it on the mission. Benny Ray said he would miss his kids, his ex-wife and Shania Twain. \\"Not more than the kids, but more than the ex-wife.\\" * Melinda Clarke - Margo Vincent (former CIA GS-14; intelligence, cryptography, linguistics) Margo Vincent was born in Bucharest, Romania; she emigrated to the United States at age six, and became a naturalized citizen. Margo developed a knack for learning languages and would eventually master six languages and become proficient in several others. Over the course of the series she demonstrated familiarity with Romanian, English, French, and some Arabic. She was told on one occasion that her Portuguese was horrible. She was a good student and graduated high school early. Margo's skill with language and intelligence led to her being recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency, as an expert primarily in Eastern Europe. At one point she was the CIA's Station Chief for Moscow in the Soviet Union. One of her spies was compromised by a KGB counter- espionage expert, who seduced the agent's wife and sent photos of their affair to him and Margo. It is unclear if this was the reason why she would end up leaving the CIA, but apparently she was fired. After leaving the agency, she initially worked in industrial espionage as a freelancer. This may have been where she developed underworld contacts for buying illegal arms. When Maj. Shepherd initially recruited her she was leaving for a potential job in France. However he convinced her to come work with him as an opportunity to make a difference, as his team's intelligence officer. Although Chance was the second highest-ranking military officer, usually Margo was shown acting as Maj. Shepherd's second in command. It is implied throughout the show that the two of them shared a mutual attraction. In one episode when Maj. Shepherd was in a coma, he dreamed that he told her that he loved her. On more than one mission she seemed a little more concerned about him than just as a colleague. However, during the show's run their relationship never developed. * R√©al Andrews - Lt. Jason \\"Chance\\" Walker (former U.S. Army; aviation expert, close quarters combat specialist) Lt. Chance Walker is a skilled martial artist; which martial arts are never made clear but probably those originating in Japan. When he was in the Army, he was a member of the elite Special Operations Aviation Regiment also known as the Night Stalkers. He showed expertise in flying everything from a variety of helicopters, turboprop planes and small passenger jets. He left the army due to a knee injury, however throughout the season he would show little signs of any complications from the injury. For example, he still jumped out of planes, fought, and trekked through hard terrain. Chance was working as track and field coach for a high school when Maj. Shepherd initially recruited him for the team's first mission. Maj. Shepherd says that he got his nickname of \\"Chance\\", because he never takes one. For example, he rolls his own parachute before missions. At the start of the second season it is stated that Chance and C.J. have moved to Hawaii, and started a business. * Mark Sheppard - Staff Sergeant Christopher \\"C.J.\\" Yates (former SAS; demolitions, electronic surveillance) Christopher \\"C.J.\\" Yates was the son of a British soldier and an Irish mother. C.J. enlisted in the British Army after finishing high school. At one point he served in a tank unit, as well as serving in the infantry. He tried out, and after three attempts would get into the elite 22nd Special Air Service or 22 SAS. Yates's specialty was explosives, however he was also trained in electronic surveillance. There is some suggestion that he may have been trained as a member of MI6, but this was never confirmed during the series. Yates was also a skilled rock climber. On an SAS mission in Libya C.J. was captured. During the experience he was tortured over an extended period of time. C.J. claimed that all he told them was useless info such as who was the greatest drummer of all time. However it has been implied that he may have told them more than that. The experience left him with a lifelong hatred of the Libyans. It was never made clear if this was the reason he left the army. Throughout the first season C.J. was used primarily for comedic relief. Known for the occasional wisecrack, and having a slightly strange sense of humor, he was still a very capable soldier. When Maj. Shepherd first contacted him, he was working in construction making use of his demolition training. It is never made clear what business he and Chance went into when they left the team for Hawaii. * David Selby - Xavier Trout (government liaison) Xavier Trout was a U.S. Army officer. In the series premiere, Maj. Shepherd addresses him as Colonel Trout, then asks if it's now General Trout. Trout says that he no longer has a rank, he is just a number on an office door. It is implied throughout the show that he now works for the National Security Council, running covert operations for the government. It is never made clear as to whether or not Maj. Shepherd's team is his only responsibility or are there other covert teams he runs. Most other information about Trout is classified and very little is revealed about him throughout the series of the show. He did several tours in Vietnam, first in the 101st Airborne Division, then as a member of the Army Rangers, and finally as a Green Beret. Trout would later be one of the officers that helped start Delta Force. It was in this capacity as a training officer that he would first meet Major Shepherd. Trout keeps himself in shape by running at least two miles every day. Trout is divorced from his first wife but currently happily married to his second wife. He and his second wife tried for a long time to have a child before they conceived a daughter, Alison. Alison Trout is a covert operative for the CIA, with a cover that she works for the United States Department of State.  Season 2  * Dennis Rodman - Chief Warrant Officer Deacon \\"Deke\\" Reynolds (former U.S. Army; helicopter pilot, demolitions) Deacon Reynolds entered the army after a judge gave him a choice between the military or jail. During his time in the Army he initially served as a demolitions expert before he became a warrant officer and would transfer to aviation. Deke also served in Operation Desert Storm. Although Reynolds had chosen the army over jail, he never fit into the military culture. He had several insubordination charges in his file, and eventually received a court martial. At this time he would be recruited by Col. Earl Swanee to perform covert missions for the U.S. government. Swanee could be said to have a similar relationship to Deke that Trout would have with Shepherd's team. However, Deke was not much of team player and would spend most of his time working solo missions. It is implied he has several connections to the underworld black market using this knowledge to provide the team with intel and equipment. When actually with the team, he replaces Chance as the group's helicopter pilot. After Col. Swanee's death, Trout asked the team (at this point consisting of only Shepherd, Vincent, and Riddle) to investigate the possibility that it was murder. At the funeral they would meet Deke, who arrived late and kissed Swanee's corpse. Deke agreed to help them find out who had killed his late mentor. When they had accomplished this, Deke, continued to work with the team under Trout. However, he was never a full-time member, usually showing up at the right moment when the team need his help. This was because in real life Dennis Rodman was still playing basketball with the Chicago Bulls and could not always get time off to shoot for the show. * David Eigenberg - Nick Delvecchio (former DEA Special Operations GS-13; undercover operations, escape artist) Nick Delvecchio grew in an Italian-American neighborhood in New York City. Delvecchio had a lifelong fascination with magic tricks. He would become an expert at various forms of sleight of hand, lock picking and escape artistry. Delvecchio left his neighborhood and then girlfriend behind to pursue a career in the Justice Department's Drug Enforcement Administration or the DEA. Leaving behind his girlfriend was one of his early regrets, but he felt it was necessary to pursue his career. During his tenure at the DEA he specialized in undercover work. It was while he was working undercover that he would meet the team, Shepherd, Margo, and Benny Ray. They had no idea that Delvecchio was undercover thinking that he was actually a part of a drug runner's gang. After they realized that they were all on the same side, they would work together to bring the dealer down. With this completed Delvecchio joined the team on a full-time basis. Delvecchio lacked a military background, and was somewhat sensitive about the fact. For example, he did not know that a klick meant a kilometer. However his knowledge of the drug trade would sometimes come in handy. He would replace CJ as the team's comic relief as well as electronics specialist.  Other members  * Billy Gallo - Ricardo \\"Rico\\" Valesquez (former Navy SEAL; underwater infiltration, combat medic, signals) Rico Valesquez was a former Navy Corpsmen who joined the SEALs. Little is known about Petty Officer Valesquez, on account that he was not a regular member of the team. When Major Shepherd first recruited him, he was no longer in the Navy but was working as an EMT in Los Angeles, California. After he got a victim to the hospital, he was seen praying for her using a crucifix. This implies that he was probably a Roman Catholic. Valesquez was injured in their first mission as a team, when he was shot in the arm. He would attend rehab and would eventually get full use of his arm back. Rico would later be seen aiding Major Shepherd in his rehab after the Major was shot in both his legs. It is unclear as to whether or not Rico was doing full-time rehab or if he just came back to help Major Shepherd. Rico would make another appearance to aid the team when Katrina Herrera would kidnap Benny Ray's son. * Brian Cousins - Lieutenant Gunter Hauer (former GSG 9; demolitions, electrical engineering.) Gunter Hauer was from Germany, other than C.J., he was the only member of the team who was not an American. During the first mission he was seen portraying a UN inspector in Iraq. However he died before the team left Iraq, Shepard the one who carried him \\"home\\"; as such very little about him was ever explained. Shepard had some of the payment go to Hauer and his family. Although Hauer is supposed to be German, the actor who played him, Brian Cousins, was in fact born in Portland, Maine.

Sponsors of the show would include SIG Sauer, Ka-Bar, SureFire, Emerson Knives, and Soldier of Fortune Magazine. In the second season of the show, SIG Sauer pistols (particularly two-tone SIG Sauer .357s) would be in highly visible use by the team, and also verbally mentioned on many occasions. Margot would even be given a SIG P230/232 (sans serial number) for her birthday. Matt (and other characters) would often be seen wearing a Ka-Bar fighting knife on their torso (Ka-Bar being another regular sponsor of the show). In one episode, one character would state that he had a subscription to Soldier of Fortune magazine.

He served in the United States Ram Fleet under his father Charles Ellet, Jr. and as commanding officer of the ram fleet as part of the Mississippi Marine Brigade under his uncle Alfred W. Ellet. He commanded the ram ships USS Queen of the West, USS Switzerland, USS Lancaster and USS Monarch during the brown-water navy battle for control of the Mississippi River and its tributaries as part of the Vicksburg Campaign from 1862 to 1863. At only nineteen years of age, he was one of the youngest colonels in the Union Army. His daring runs of two different ram ships past the batteries at Vicksburg as well as operations on the Yazoo River won him praise from William T. Sherman and David Dixon Porter. However, he was criticized by Porter when his aggressive actions on the Red River led to the capture of the Queen of the West by Confederate forces. Early life and education Ellet was born on June 1, 1843 in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C. He was the only son to the well-known civil engineer Charles Ellet Jr. In 1855, he traveled to Europe with his father and attended school in Paris for two years. He studied medicine at Georgetown University until the Civil War began. In 1861 he volunteered as an assistant surgeon and helped treat wounded soldiers from the First Battle of Bull Run in Washington, D.C. Civil war Ellet joined the Union Army in the spring of 1862 as a medical cadet working as an assistant to a Union Army surgeon. He transferred to the United States Ram Fleet led by his father. The ram fleet was a Union Army unit of ram ships converted from commercial steamboats. In June 1862, he served in the First Battle of Memphis as a medical cadet on the Switzerland. He was one of the Union Army representatives that accepted the surrender of Memphis. Ellet and his cousin, Edward Ellet, lowered the Confederate flag over the Memphis post office and raised the American flag in its place. His father died from a wound received during the Battle of Memphis and command of the ram fleet went to his uncle Alfred W. Ellet. Actions north of Vicksburg On June 26, Alfred W. Ellet commanded the Monarch and Charles R. Ellet commanded the Lancaster during action on the Yazoo River near Liverpool, Mississippi, to capture or destroy three Confederate gunboats. The Confederates burned their ships; the CSS General Van Dorn, CSS General Polk and CSS Livingston, when they saw the Union forces approaching. On July 15, Queen of the West, , and engaged the Confederate ironclad ram on the Yazoo River. The Arkansas was heavily damaged but escaped into the Mississippi River and took refuge under the Confederate batteries at Vicksburg, Mississippi. On July 22, Queen of the West and attacked Arkansas, despite the batteries at Vicksburg. During the engagement, the Queen of the West rammed Arkansas but inflicted only minor damage and rejoined the Mississippi River Squadron ships above Vicksburg. In August, the USS Benton along with Ellet's rams Monarch and Lancaster, captured the CSS Fairplay at Milliken's Bend on the Mississippi River. When captured, the steamer was carrying five thousand muskets and ammunition headed for the Army of the Trans-Mississippi. Ellet and the Queen of the West continued to support operations against Vicksburg. On September 19, while escorting two transport barges, the Queen of the West had a short engagement with Confederate infantry and artillery on the Mississippi River above Bolivar, Mississippi. Ellet and the Queen of the West also conducted operations in the Yazoo River clearing mines and engaging Confederate batteries. In November 1862, the Mississippi Marine Brigade, an amphibious raiding unit, was organized by Alfred W. Ellet. The ram fleet was incorporated as a part of the brigade. On November 5, Charles was promoted to the rank of colonel and became the third member of the Ellet family to lead the ram fleet. Ellet was only 19 years old which made him one of the youngest colonels in the Union Army. In December 1862, Ellet was assigned the task to arm the USS Lioness with a torpedo raft, known as a devil, and use it to destroy armed rafts on the Yazoo River directly in front of the batteries at Drumgold's Bluff. While the mission planned for December 31 was scrapped due to heavy fog, Admiral David Dixon Porter praised Ellet in a report to Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton. Porter wrote, \\"Colonel Ellet took it upon himself the perilous duty of running up in the Lioness, in face of the batteries, to clear out the torpedoes or break the wires, and to plant torpedoes on the raft which had batteries at each end of it. No doubt he would have performed it or lost his life and his vessel. I have great confidence in the commander of the rams and those under him, and take this opportunity to state to the department how highly I appreciate the commander and his associates.\\" First run past Vicksburg On February 2, 1863, Ellet was ordered by Admiral David Dixon Porter to run the Queen of the West past the batteries at Vicksburg, Mississippi, to support Admiral David Farragut below the city. The boat was equipped with a 30-pounder bow gun, three 12-pounder howitzers, cotton bales and wooden sheathing for protection. Major General William T. Sherman described Ellet as \\"full of energy and resources\\" in his preparations to run two of his rams past Vicksburg. Ellet intended to \\"run the gauntlet\\" of Vicksburg by cover of night, however delays resulted in passage of the guns at daybreak. The guns at Vicksburg fired for 50 minutes straight. The Queen of the West took 12 hits and lost a gun but made it past the batteries with minimal damage. The run provided the Union forces with insight as to where the guns at Vicksburg were positioned. USS Queen of the West ramming the CSS City of Vicksburg Once past the batteries, Ellet's orders were to intercept Confederate boat traffic at the mouth of the Red River and specifically destroy the CSS City of Vicksburg. Ellet found the City of Vicksburg docked, rammed her and set her ablaze with turpentine soaked balls fired from the guns of the Queen of the West. Ellet caused significant damage to the City of Vicksburg but failed to destroy her. The Queen of the West had to disengage before destroying the City of Vicksburg due to enemy fire which set the cotton bales aboard the Queen of the West ablaze. Ellet recommended the Union forces supply the Queen of the West with fuel by floating an unmanned coal barge filled with 20,000 bushels of coal past the Vicksburg batteries at night. The barge went unnoticed by the Confederate forces and floated downriver before being intercepted by the Queen of the West. The barge provided the Queen of the West with enough fuel to continue her mission. On February 3, Ellet and the Queen of the West captured three Confederate transport ships ‚Äì the CSS A.W. Baker, CSS Moro and CSS Berwick Bay. The Moro was empty of cargo since it had just dropped off supplies at Port Hudson, Louisiana. The other two ships were laden with food supplies headed toward Vicksburg. The Queen of the West rendezvoused with the De Soto and on February 12, Ellet directed both ships down the Atchafalaya River to Simmesport, Louisiana, in search of Confederate forces. The crew went ashore, destroyed all supplies found and looted the residential area. On the way back up the Mississippi River, the Queen of the West received Confederate gun fire and the 1st mate was injured. In retaliation, Ellet and his crew burned three plantations that were believed to be the residences of those that injured the 1st mate. Loss of the Queen of the West Capture of the Queen of the West by Confederate forces On February 14, Ellet led the Queen of the West and De Soto up the Red River and captured the steamboat Era No. 5 carrying 4,500 bushels of corn. Ellet moved the Queen of the West upstream to investigate reports of steamships at Gordon's Landing near Marksville, Louisiana. She came under heavy fire by the shore batteries of Fort DeRussy and was run aground onto the right bank by her pilot instead of backing down river as ordered. She was directly in the sight of Confederate guns, which pounded her until Ellet ordered \\"abandon ship\\". The Queen of the West was not burned out of concern for the 1st mate, who was wounded and could not be moved. The USS Queen of the West was captured, repaired and re-entered into service as the CSS Queen of the West by the Confederate forces. Ellet and the crew escaped and floated downstream on bales of cotton and were rescued by the De Soto. The De Soto and the Era No. 5 fled down the Red River to rejoin the Union forces. During their escape downstream, the pilot grounded the De Soto and severely damaged the paddles by continuing to run them long after contact, whereupon the pilot was placed under arrest by Ellet. In his official report, Ellet alleged the grounding was done purposely by the pilot, whom he accused of being a rebel sympathizer. The De Soto was set ablaze to prevent her capture by Confederate forces and Ellet and crew escaped on the Era No. 5. The CSS Queen of the West joined forces with the CSS Webb to attack and sink the USS Indianola on the Mississippi River south of Vicksburg. In his report, Admiral David Dixon Porter criticized the aggressiveness of Ellet to continue up the Red River instead of maintaining guard at the mouth of the Red River and awaiting arrival of the Indianola. Porter wrote in his report, \\"Had the commander of the Queen of the West waited patiently, he would, in less than twenty-four hours, have been joined by the Indianola...This is a serious disappointment to us [above Vicksburg], as we calculated certainly on starving on the garrison at Port Hudson by merely blockading the mouth of the Red River. My plans were well laid, only poorly executed. I can give orders, but I cannot give officers good judgment.\\" Porter also questioned whether Ellet and his crew abandoned the Queen of the West too easily since it was entered back into service by Confederate forces so quickly. Second run past Vicksburg On March 26, Ellet ran a second ram ship, the Switzerland, past the batteries at Vicksburg to support Admiral Farragut. Ellet commanded the Switzerland and his cousin, John A. Ellet, commanded the Lancaster. Both ships received heavy fire from the batteries and the Lancaster was run aground and sunk to avoid capture by the Confederate forces. The Switzerland was damaged but was repaired and continued duty on the Mississippi until Vicksburg and Port Hudson were captured by Union forces. Ellet also commanded the infantry of the Mississippi Marine Brigade until he requested a leave of absence due to poor health. He tendered his resignation on August 14, 1863. Command of the ram fleet went to his cousin John A. Ellet. Death and legacy Charles Rivers Ellet was interred at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia After leaving the military, Ellet recuperated at the home of his uncle Dr. E.C. Ellet in Bunker Hill, Illinois. Ellet was a chronic sufferer from migraines, which he treated with laudanum. On the evening before his death, Ellet complained he did not feel well and was going to take medication for \\"the pain in his face\\". He died during the night of October 29, 1863 from what was most likely an accidental overdose by a self-administered injection of morphine. He was known to have previously prepared and administered self-injections of morphine. He was interred at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia next to his father. The US Navy destroyer USS Ellet, in service from 1939 to 1946, was named in honor of Charles Rivers Ellet and other members of his family.

Like its counterpart, the Senate was established by the United States Constitution and convened for its first meeting on March 4, 1789 at Federal Hall in New York City. The history of the institution begins prior to that date, at the 1787 Constitutional Convention, in James Madison's Virginia Plan, which proposed a bicameral national legislature, and in the Connecticut Compromise, an agreement reached between delegates from states and those from states that in part defined the structure and representation that each state would have in the new Congress.  Constitutional creation  The U.S. Senate, named after the ancient Roman Senate, was designed as a more deliberative body than the U.S. House. Edmund Randolph called for its members to be \\"less than the House of Commons ... to restrain, if possible, the fury of democracy.\\" According to James Madison, \\"The use of the Senate is to consist in proceeding with more coolness, with more system, and with more wisdom, than the popular branch.\\" Instead of two-year terms as in the House, senators serve six-year terms, giving them more authority to ignore mass sentiment in favor of the country's broad interests. The smaller number of members and staggered terms also give the Senate a greater sense of community. Despite their past grievances with specific ruling British governments, many among the Founding Fathers of the United States who gathered for the Constitutional Convention had retained a great admiration for the British system of governance. Alexander Hamilton called it \\"the best in the world,\\" and said he \\"doubted whether anything short of it would do in America.\\" In his Defense of the Constitutions of Government of the United States, John Adams stated \\"the English Constitution is, in theory, both for the adjustment of the balance and the prevention of its vibrations, the most stupendous fabric of human invention.\\" In general, they viewed the Senate to be an American version of House of Lords.Richard N. Rosenfeld John Dickinson said the Senate should \\"consist of the most distinguished characters, distinguished for their rank in life and their weight of property, and bearing as strong a likeness to the British House of Lords as possible.\\"Harpers, May 2004, p42 The Senate was also intended to give states with smaller populations equal standing with larger states, which are given more representation in the House. The apportionment scheme of the Senate was controversial at the Constitutional Convention. Hamilton, who was joined in opposition to equal suffrage by Madison, said equal representation despite population differences \\"shocks too much the ideas of justice and every human feeling.\\"The Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787 by James Madison Referring to those who demanded equal representation, Madison called for the Convention \\"to renounce a principle which was confessedly unjust.\\" The delegates representing a majority of Americans might have carried the day, but at the Constitutional Convention, each state had an equal vote, and any issue could be brought up again if a state desired it. The state delegations originally voted 6‚Äì5 for proportional representation, but small states without claims of western lands reopened the issue and eventually turned the tide towards equality. On the final vote, the five states in favor of equal apportionment in the Senate‚ÄîConnecticut, North Carolina, Maryland, New Jersey, and Delaware‚Äîonly represented one-third of the nation's population. The four states that voted against it‚ÄîVirginia, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Georgia‚Äîrepresented almost twice as many people than the proponents. Convention delegate James Wilson wrote \\"Our Constituents, had they voted as their representatives did, would have stood as 2/3 against equality, and 1/3 only in favor of it\\".Harper's Magazine, May 2004, 36. One reason the large states accepted the Connecticut Compromise was a fear that the small states would either refuse to join the Union, or, as Gunning Bedford, Jr. of Delaware threatened, \\"the small ones w[ould] find some foreign ally of more honor and good faith, who will take them by the hand and do them justice\\".New Republic, August 7, 2002. In Federalist No. 62, James Madison, the \\"Father of the Constitution,\\" openly admitted that the equal suffrage in the Senate was a compromise, a \\"lesser evil,\\" and not born out of any political theory. \\"[I]t is superfluous to try, by the standard of theory, a part of the Constitution which is allowed on all hands to be the result, not of theory, but 'of a spirit of amity, and that mutual deference and concession which the peculiarity of our political situation rendered indispensable.'\\" Even Gunning Bedford, Jr. of Delaware admitted that he only favored equal representation because it advanced the interests of his own state. \\"Can it be expected that the small states will act from pure disinterestedness? Are we to act with greater purity than the rest of mankind?\\"Sizing Up the Senate, 33. Once the issue of equal representation had been settled, the delegates addressed the size of the body: to how many senators would each state be entitled? Giving each state one senator was considered insufficient, as it would make the achievement of a quorum more difficult. A proposal from the Pennsylvania delegates for each state to elect three senators was discussed, but the resulting greater size was deemed a disadvantage. When the delegates voted on a proposal for two senators per state, all states supported this number.The Senate and the United States Constitution, United States Senate, undated. Retrieved May 21, 2014. Since 1789, differences in population between states have become more pronounced. At the time of the Connecticut Compromise, the largest state, Virginia, had only twelve times the population of the smallest state, Delaware. Today, the largest state, California, has a population that is seventy times greater than the population of the smallest state, Wyoming. In 1790, it would take a theoretical 30% of the population to elect a majority of the Senate, today it would take 17%.  1789‚Äì1865  The Senate originally met, virtually in secret, on the second floor of Federal Hall in New York City in a room that allowed no spectators. For five years, no notes were published on Senate proceedings. A procedural issue of the early Senate was what role the vice president, the President of the Senate, should have. The first vice president was allowed to craft legislation and participate in debates, but those rights were taken away relatively quickly. John Adams seldom missed a session, but later vice presidents made Senate attendance a rarity. Although the founders intended the Senate to be the slower legislative body, in the early years of the Republic, it was the House that took its time passing legislation. Alexander Hamilton's Bank of the United States and Assumption Bill (he was then Treasury Secretary), both of which were controversial, easily passed the Senate, only to meet opposition from the House. In 1797, Thomas Jefferson began the vice presidential tradition of only attending Senate sessions on special occasions. Despite his frequent absences Jefferson did make his mark on the body with the Senate book of parliamentary procedure, his 1801 Manual of Parliamentary Practice for the Use of the Senate of the United States, which is still used. The decades before the American Civil War are thought of as the \\"Golden Age\\" of the Senate. Backed by public opinion and President Jefferson, in 1804, the House voted to impeach Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase, 73‚Äì32. The Senate voted against conviction, 18‚Äì16. The Senate seemed to bring out the best in Aaron Burr, who as vice president presided over the impeachment trial. At the conclusion of the trial Burr said: Even Burr's many critics conceded that he handled himself with great dignity, and the trial with fairness. Debate over Compromise of 1850 in the Old Senate Chamber. Digitally restored. Over the next few decades the Senate rose in reputation in the United States and the world. John C. Calhoun, Daniel Webster, Thomas Hart Benton, Stephen A. Douglas, and Henry Clay overshadowed several presidents. Sir Henry Maine called the Senate \\"the only thoroughly successful institution which has been established since the tide of modern democracy began to run.\\" William Ewart Gladstone said the Senate was \\"the most remarkable of all the inventions of modern politics.\\"Master of the Senate, 23. Among the greatest of debates in Senate history was the Webster‚ÄìHayne debate of January 1830, pitting the sectional interests of Daniel Webster's New England against Robert Y. Hayne's South. During the pre-Civil War decades, the nation had two contentious arguments over the North‚ÄìSouth balance in the Senate. Since the banning of slavery north of the Mason‚ÄìDixon line there had always been equal numbers of slave and free states. In the Missouri Compromise of 1820, brokered by Henry Clay, Maine was admitted to the Union as a free state to counterbalance Missouri. The Compromise of 1850, brokered by Henry Clay and Stephen Douglas, helped postpone the Civil War.  1865‚Äì1913  \\"The Bosses of the Senate by Reformers like Joseph Keppler depicted the Senate being controlled by giant moneybags which represented the financial trusts and monopolies. In the post-Civil War era, the Senate dealt with great national issues such as Reconstruction and monetary policy. Given the strong political parties of the Third Party System, the leading politicians controlled enough support in state legislatures to be elected Senators. In an age of unparalleled industrial expansion, entrepreneurs had the prestige previously reserved to victorious generals, and many were elected to the Senate. In 1890‚Äì1910 a handful of Republicans controlled the chamber, led by Nelson Aldrich (Rhode Island), Orville H. Platt (Connecticut), John Coit Spooner (Wisconsin), William Boyd Allison (Iowa), along with national party leader Mark Hanna (Ohio). Aldrich designed all the major tax and tariff laws of the early 20th century, including the Federal reserve system. Among the Democrats Arthur Pue Gorman of Maryland stood out. From 1871 to 1898, the Senate did not approve any treaties. The Senate scuttled a long series of reciprocal trade agreements, blocked deals to annex the Dominican Republic and the Danish West Indies, defeated an arbitration deal with Britain, and forced the renegotiation of the pact to build the Panama Canal. Finally, in 1898, the Senate nearly refused to ratify the treaty that ended the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War.  1913‚Äì1945  The Senate underwent several significant changes during the presidency of Woodrow Wilson, the most profound of which was the ratification of the 17th Amendment in 1913, which provided for election of senators by popular vote rather than appointment by the state legislatures. Another change that occurred during the presidency of Woodrow Wilson was the limitation of the filibuster through the cloture vote. The filibuster was first used in the early Republic, but was seldom seen during most of the 19th century. It was limited as a response to the filibuster of the arming of merchant ships in World War I. At that time, the public, the House, the great majority of the Senate, and the president wanted merchant ships armed, but less than 20 Senators, led by William Jennings Bryan fought to keep US ships unarmed. Wilson denounced the group as a \\"group of willful men\\". The post of Senate Majority Leader was also created during the Wilson presidency. Before this time, a Senate leader was usually a committee chairman, or a person of great eloquence, seniority, or wealth, such as Daniel Webster and Nelson Aldrich. However, despite this new, formal leadership structure, the Senate leader initially had virtually no power, other than priority of recognition from the presiding officer. Since the Democrats were fatally divided into northern liberal and southern conservative blocs, the Democratic leader had even less power than his title suggested. Rebecca Felton was sworn in as a Senator for Georgia on November 21, 1922, and served one day; she was the first woman to serve in the Senate.David B. Parker, \\"Rebecca Latimer Felton (1835‚Äì1930),\\" New Georgia Encyclopedia (2010) online Joseph T. Robinson of Arkansas, the Democratic leader from 1923 to 1937, saw it as his responsibility not to lead the Democrats, but to work the Senate for the president's benefit, no matter who the president was. When Coolidge and Hoover were president, he assisted them in passing Republican legislation. Robinson helped end government operation of Muscle Shoals, helped pass the Hoover Tariff, and stymied a Senate investigation of the Power Trust. Robinson switched his own position on a drought relief program for farmers when Hoover made a proposal for a more modest measure. Alben Barkley called Robinson's cave-in \\"the most humiliating spectacle that could be brought about in an intelligent legislative body.\\" When Franklin Roosevelt became president, Robinson followed the new president as loyally as he had followed Coolidge and Hoover. Robinson passed bills in the Hundred Days so quickly that Will Rogers joked \\"Congress doesn't pass legislation any more, they just wave at the bills as they go by.\\"Master of the Senate, 354‚Äì55 In 1932 Hattie Caraway of Arkansas became the first woman elected to the Senate. In 1937 the Senate opposed Roosevelt's \\"court packing\\" plan and successfully called for reduced deficits.  Since 1945  The popular Senate drama of the early 1950s was Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy's investigations of alleged communists. After years of unchallenged power, McCarthy fell as a result of producing little hard evidence for his claims while the claims themselves became more elaborate, even questioning the leadership of the United States Army. McCarthy was censured by the Senate in 1954. Prior to World War II, Senate majority leader had few formal powers. But in 1937, the rule giving majority leader right of first recognition was created. With the addition of this rule, the Senate majority leader enjoyed far greater control over the agenda of which bills to be considered on the floor. During Lyndon Baines Johnson's tenure as Senate leader, the leader gained new powers over committee assignments. In 1971 Paulette Desell was appointed by Senator Jacob K. Javits as the Senate's first female page. In 2009 Kathie Alvarez became the Senate's first female legislative clerk.

A wide variety of music genres are used in Goa ranging from Western art music to Indian classical music. Konkani music is also popular across this tiny state. Being a former territory of Portugal, Goa has a dominant western musical scene with the use of instrument such as the violin, drums, guitar, trumpet and piano. It has also produced a number of prominent musicians and singers for the world of Indian music. Portuguese Fado also has significance in Goa. Lorna Cordeiro is a popular singer and is referred to as the \\"nightingale of Goa\\". She sings in both English and Konkani. Some of her popular oldies are Pisso, Bebdo, Red Rose, Tuzo mog and Noxibak Rodta. Other popular musicians and singers include Anthony Gonsalves (violinist), Ant√≥nio Fortunato de Figueiredo (conductor and violinist), Chris Perry (often called the king of Goan music), Hema Sardesai (playback singer), Ian D'Sa, (former guitarist of Canadian band Billy Talent, of Goan descent), Remo Fernandes (musician and playback singer), Kishori Amonkar (classical vocalist), Dinanath Mangeshkar (dramatist and classical vocalist), and Oliver Sean (singer/songwriter). Goa has produced many performers of Indian classical music, such as the vocalist Kesarbai Kerkar, Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhosle. Goan local bands are also known for their use of western music styles and are popular at both, public and private celebrations. Goa has become home to a style of Electronic music, the Trance music. It is popular at the Electronic music festivals hosted yearly in Goa that attract people from over 50 countries. However, owing to the tourism peak around the Christmas-New year period, the festivals have either been cancelled or rescheduled on other dates. Traditional music The traditional Goan musical instruments include dhol, mridanga, tabla, ghumat, dholak, kansallem, mhadalem, shehnai, surt, tasso, nagado, and tambura. The ghumat is an earthen-ware pot-like vessel made by Goan potters with openings on the two opposite sides, one large and the other small in diameter, with the middle portion much bulging outwards. On the larger opening with the edge conveniently moulded for the fitting, a wet skin of a lizard (lacerta ocelata), known in Konkani as sap or gar, is fully stretched to cover the whole surface of the opening. The ghumat is essential for Hindu festivals, some temple rituals like Suvari vadan, bhivari and mando performances. A mhadalem is a cylindrical earthen vessel covered at both ends with the skin of a lizard and is mostly played by the Kunbis. Surpavo and konpavo are flutes of the dhangar community of Goa. The surpavo is a long bamboo flute of the shepherds. The instrument is like a staff and is around 60-70 cm long.http://musicartsdance.blogspot.com/2013/03/are-goan-musical- instruments-extinct-by.html Its sound is described as being 'soft and sweet'.http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/12459/14/14_appendix.pdf The konpavo is 20-30 cm long. Its tone is described as being 'bright and high- pitched'. It is played in the upright position and is made of bamboo with a reed. This instrument is said to calm aggressive or disturbed cattle.http://goachitra.com/research.html Surt (Konkani: ‡§∏‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§§) is a long wooden tube fixed with a funnel shaped bell with three holes.

Korno (Konkani: ‡§ï‡•ã‡§∞‡§®‡•ã) is a wooden straight trumpet with a funnel-shaped bell. Banko is a curved brass pipe instrument with four pipes fitted in one another. It has a harsh and loud sound.http://digitalgoa.com/fairs-and-festival-of-goa/ Being part of Portugal for over 450 years led to the introduction of the piano, mandolin and violin to Goa. Other instruments such as the drums, guitar and trumpet were also widely used. Schools in this period taught pupils at least one such instrument. It is said that Goans have music in their blood, a statement further strengthened by the role music and dance plays in Goan culture. Popular folk dances such as the Portuguese Corridinho are still part of Catholic weddings. Konkani song may be classified in four groups: one which draws on the more pristine form in music and verse, as in the fugdi or the dhalo; the second which blends western and native music but retains Konkani lyrics as in deknnis; the third which blends native and western music as well as language as in dulpod; and the fourth which has a marked influence of western music and lyrics (in Konkani) with borrowed Portuguese words as in mando.

Refer also to Rodrigues, Manuel C. 1957. ‚ÄúFolk Songs of Goa ‚Äú, in : Goan Tribune of 6.10.1957, pp. 9-10. types of Konkani Song have been classified. These include banvarh, deknni, dhalo, dulpod, duvalo, fell song, fughri, kunnbi song, launimm, mando, ovi, palnnam, talghari, tiatr song, zagor song and zoti. The Christian hymns and Hindu religious songs are also characterized separately with the former related to contemporary western styles. * Banvarh is a mourning song, usually sung on the day of cremation by Hindus. * Deknni is a song which originated in Bardez, Ilhas and Salcete. * Dhalo is a wedding song. * Dulpod is a dance song with quick rhythm and themes from everyday Goan life. * Duvallo is a pregnancy song. * Fell is folk drama with themes from Indian epics or Indian history. It is performed by wandering artists usually after the rains, which start in June and end in August or September. The fell song is a dance song. * Fughri is a dance song performed on religious occasions, particularly in honour of the deity Ganesha. * The Kunnbi, who are probably together with the Gaudde the oldest inhabitants of Goa, belong to the peasant strata. The kunnbi song is a dance song in the fughri style depicting their own life, but also protesting against exploitation and social discrimination in a subtle manner. * Launim is a song dealing with religious and legendary themes. * Mando is a dance song whose major theme is love, the minor ones being historical narratives, grievance against exploitation and social injustice, and political resistance during the Portuguese presence in Goa. * Ovi, which the Portuguese termed as versos, is a song with nuptial themes. It has the Sanskrit root vri which means ‚Äúto choose, to select‚Äù. The ovi has three rhymed lines and one unrhymed. The former contain each three or four words and the fourth line one, two, and exceptionally three words. The number of syllables is nine for the rhymed lines and four or five for the last line. The early Portuguese Christian missionaries adopted the ovi-form for liturgical and devotional hymns. * Palnnam is a cradle song, a lullaby. * Talgarhi is a song of the Gaudde. The theatre song is sung during the stage play, mainly performed by wandering artists during the dry season. They entertain the public while touching on daily life, but also sing subtle satires on local politics and the shortcomings of Goans. * Zagor means ‚Äúwatch‚Äù. The zagor song is sung in kunnbi folk plays depicting their own life. They are usually staged at night. * Zoti is sung at nuptials. The Christian hymns and Hindu songs for the liturgy and popular devotions form an essential part of Goan daily life. It is common for passersby to hear people playing instruments in their houses during the evening hours. Western, Portuguese and indigenous Local musician performing at Martins Corner in Betalbatim Portuguese music and dance on cruise, Mandovi River in Panjim Goa, a part of India since 1961, had been part of Portugal for over 450 years and hence has closer connections with Western classical and popular music. Use of Portuguese music and other western music is popular specifically at most Catholic weddings and celebrations. Live bands are a celebratory feature at such weddings and are generally clubbed with a local Disc Jockey to allow for intervals to be covered also. Over the centuries, indigenous Goan music was blended with European music, particularly that of Portugal. Hence Goan music uses western styles, notes and musical instruments more significantly than regional Asian variants. The Goa Symphony Orchestra and Goa Philharmonic Choir were founded by Lourdino Barreto. Another major attraction of the Goan music industry is the Tiatr derived from the Portuguese word 'teatro' meaning theater. It is a type of musical theatre still very popular with Goans, resident in Goa or Bombay as well as with expatriates and resident communities in the Middle East, London and other major western cities (where Konkani speakers have a considerable presence). The dramas are performed in the Roman Konkani dialects and include music, dancing and singing. Tiatr performers are called tiatrists. Songs integral to the plays are known as 'Kants'. Other songs, called kantaram are generally either comedic or based on topical, political and controversial issues that are interspersed through the performance. These musical interludes are independent of the main theme of the play. The songs are often satirical and unsparing of the politics and politicians of Goa. The music is provided by a live band including keyboard, trumpet, saxophone, bass guitar and drums. This century old theater industry in Goa still remains independent of government control and efforts to bring it under such control have met massive opposition from locals for fear of government regulation over content of political nature. The Monte Music Festival hosted by Lisbon-headquartered Funda√ß√£o Oriente, in partnership with the hotel Cidade de Goa is one of the premier cultural events on Goa‚Äôs crowded calendar. Every year, the three-day concert features both Indian and Western classical music along with dance performances held at the spectacularly situated Capela do Monte, high above the old capital of the Estado da India (former Portuguese state). The area is a UNESCO world heritage site. The recently introduced annual two-day Ketevan World Sacred music festival offers music programs, courses and conferences with artists from several traditions around the world including Carnatic, Christian, Sufi, Hindustani, Jewish, Orthodox and many others. Artists like Santiango Girelli (orchestra conductor from Argentina), Rocio De Frutos (soprano from Spain) and Leo Rossi (violinist from Argentina) have participated in past events.

The standard hymnal of the Archdiocese of Goa and Daman is called Gaionancho Jhelo (Garland of hymns) and the diocese also brings out a periodical sheet music publication of Konkani liturgical hymns a called Devacheam Bhurgeanchim Gitam (Songs of God's children). As with the liturgy, the entire music of the Catholic church in Goa is in the Latin script. Lourdino Barretto, presented by the Santa Cecilia Choir, conducted by Rev. Romeo Monteiro, at Goa (April 2008). Churches across Goa always maintain choirs. Like most Catholic churches worldwide, there are separate choirs for adults and children. Some historically significant seminaries also maintain choirs of their own. A notable one is the all-male seminarians of the Santa Cecilia Choir (Coro di Santa Cecilia), part of the over 400 year old Rachol seminary (Semin√°rio de Rachol) of Goa. The choir has also been known to use a 16th-century restored pipe organ for its concerts. Most of the centuries-old churches in Goa feature these pipe organs, but few are known to use them now because of their upkeep. However, they still form part of the churches interior decor and in almost all instances are located in the nave above the main entrances facing the altar in the far end below. Pop In the area of Western music, there are several pop stars, among them Remo Fernandes (born 1953). Goan popular music is generally sung in the Konkani language and English language. Another contributor to Goan music is the Canadian-Goan band Goa Amigos, which has represented Goa at the largest South Asian festival in North America. Home for electronic music Goa has become a home for electronic music, especially a style called Goa trance. This genre began its evolution in the late 1960s, when hippies from the United States, United Kingdom and elsewhere turned Goa into a tourist destination. When tourism began to die out, a number of devotees stayed in the area, pursuing a specific style of trance music. Early pioneers included Mark Allen, Goa Gil and Fred Disko. Goa trance Goa Trance (sometimes referred to as Goa or by the number 604) is a form of electronic music that developed around the same time as Trance music became popular in Europe. It originated during the late 1980s and early 1990s in the Indian state of Goa. Essentially, Trance music was pop culture's answer to the Goa Trance music scene on the beaches of Goa where the traveler's music scene has been famous since the time of the Beatles. Goa Trance enjoyed the greater part of its success from around 1994 -1998, and since then has dwindled significantly both in production and consumption, being replaced by its successor, Psychedelic Trance (also known as psytrance). Many of the original Goa Trance artists: Hallucinogen, Slinky Wizard, and Total Eclipse are still making music, but refer to their style of music simply as \\"PSY\\". TIP Records, Flying Rhino Records, Dragonfly Records, Transient Records, Phantasm Records, Symbiosis Records, Blue Room Released were all key players on the beach and in the scene. Goa Trance is closely related to the emergence of Psytrance during the latter half of the 1990s and early 2000s, where the two genres mixed together. In popular culture, the distinction between the two genres often remains largely a matter of opinion (they are considered by some to be synonymous; others say that Psytrance is more \\"psychedelic/cybernetic\\" and that Goa Trance is more \\"organic\\", and still others maintain that there is a clear difference between the two). If anything, the styles are easier to differentiate in Central and Eastern Europe (e.g. Austria, Hungary, Romania) where Goa Trance parties are more popular than Psy-Trance parties - the opposite being true in the UK, Belgium and Germany. Psy Trance has a noticeably more aggressive bass line and Goa tends to avoid the triplet-style bass lines. Between them however, both psy- and Goa trance are sonically distinct from other forms of trance in both tonal quality, structure and feel. In many countries they are generally more underground and less commercial than other forms of trance, except for Brazil and Israel, which since the year of 2000 it became both countries most popular type of music for the general party scene. Top DJs from the UK and other parts of Western Europe fly to Goa for special parties, often on the beaches or in rice paddies. \\"Shorebar\\" at Anjuna Beach in Northern Goa is traditionally seen as the birthplace and center of the Goan trance scene.

It is a remake of the 1954 Billy Wilder film Sabrina, which in turn was based upon the 1953 play Sabrina Fair. It was directed by Sydney Pollack, and stars Harrison Ford as Linus Larrabee, Julia Ormond as Sabrina and Greg Kinnear (in his first starring film role) as David Larrabee. It also features Angie Dickinson, Richard Crenna, Nancy Marchand, Lauren Holly, John Wood, Dana Ivey, and French actress Fanny Ardant. Sabrina was released on December 15, 1995, by Paramount Pictures. The film was a box office disappointment, but earned mostly positive reviews from critics. Plot Sabrina Fairchild is the young daughter of the Larrabee family's chauffeur, Thomas, and has been in love with David Larrabee all her life. David is a playboy, constantly falling in love, yet he has never noticed Sabrina, much to her dismay. Sabrina travels to Paris for a fashion internship at Vogue and returns as an attractive, sophisticated woman. David, after initially not recognizing her, is quickly drawn to her despite being newly engaged to Elizabeth Tyson, a doctor and billionaire. David's workaholic older brother Linus fears that David's imminent wedding to the very suitable Elizabeth might be endangered. If the wedding were to be canceled, so would a lucrative merger with the bride's family business, Tyson Electronics, run by her father Patrick. This could cost the Larrabee Corporation, run by Linus and his mother Maude, in the neighborhood of a billion dollars. Linus tries to redirect Sabrina's affections to himself and it works. Sabrina falls in love with him, even though she quotes others as calling Linus \\"the world's only living heart donor\\" and someone who \\"thinks that morals are paintings on walls and scruples are money in Russia.\\" In the process, Linus also falls in love with her. Unwilling to admit his feelings, Linus confesses his scheme to Sabrina at the last minute and sends her back to Paris. Before she gets on the plane to Paris, her father informs her that over the years of chauffeuring the father of David and Linus, he listened. When Mr. Larrabee sold, he sold and when Mr. Larrabee bought, he bought. Sabrina jokingly says \\"So you are telling me that you have a million dollars?\\" Her father says no, he has a little over two million and that her mother would want her to have it. Meanwhile, Linus realizes his true feelings for Sabrina, and is induced to follow her to Paris by chiding from his mother and an unexpectedly adult and responsible David, who steps into his shoes at the Larrabee Corporation with detailed plans for the merger with Tyson. Linus arrives in Paris and reunites with Sabrina, revealing his love to her and kissing her.

The location used to portray the Larrabee family's mansion was the 'Salutation' estate, which is located on Long Island in Glen Cove, New York. This home was built around 1929 for Junius Spencer Morgan III, who was a director of the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company. His father was J. P. Morgan, Jr., who was a banker and the son of J. P. Morgan, the renowned financier. The property is no longer owned by the Morgan family, but it is still in private hands and used as a residence. The movie made extensive use of this mansion's interiors during the filming. Reception=Box office The film was a box office disappointment, with a result of US$53 million domestically and $87 million worldwide.

The urban population of Esperance was 12,145 at June 2018. Its major industries are tourism, agriculture, and fishing. History European history of the region dates back to 1627 when the Dutch vessel Gulden Zeepaert, skippered by Fran√ßois Thijssen, passed through waters off the Esperance coast and continued across the Great Australian Bight. French explorers are credited with making the first landfall near the present day town, naming it and other local landmarks while sheltering from a storm in this area in 1792. The town itself was named after a French ship, the Esp√©rance, commanded by Jean-Michel Huon de Kermadec. Esp√©rance is French for \\"hope\\". In 1802, British navigator Matthew Flinders sailed the Bay of Isles, discovering and naming places such as Lucky Bay and Thistle Cove. Whalers, sealers and pirates followed, as did pastoralists and miners, keen to exploit the free land and cash in on the gold boom in the gold fields to the north. The first European settlement of the Esperance townsite area was by the Dempsters, a pioneer family of Scottish descent, in the 1860s. First published in hardcopy in the Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 4, (MUP), 1972 The Dempster brothers, Charles, Edward, Andrew and James, were granted of land in the area, first settling in 1864. They initially brought sheep, cattle and horses overland from Northam, but in 1866 they shipped stock to the Esperance area from South Australia. They built Esperance's first landing, but only one ship made the Adelaide to Esperance voyage in the first year. Once other settlers started taking up land on the Esperance coastal plain, a small settlement developed, serving as an important link in the Overland Telegraph between Albany and Eucla. A telegraph station was opened in 1876, although the formal gazettal of the townsite did not occur until 1893.Western Australian Government Gazette, file 1339/93, 14 December 1893, p.1241. The town jetty was also built through the 1890s, following the discovery of gold in the eastern goldfields region. At this point, Esperance became the \\"gateway to the Goldfields.\\" The population of the town was 985 (623 males and 362 females) in 1898. After visiting the town in 1898, Western Australian Premier John Forrest pledged to construct a railway line between Esperance and the Goldfields. However, due to a perceived threat that Adelaide merchants would take Goldfields trade away from Fremantle merchants via the Esperance port, Norseman was connected by rail to the Goldfields and Fremantle, but the line was not extended to Esperance. A railway line between Coolgardie and Esperance was eventually completed in 1927. The Mallee area approximately north of the town began grain production in the 1920s, and by 1935 the construction of a second jetty, tankers jetty, was completed. After a rail link had been established between Salmon Gums and the Esperance port in 1925, the wheat harvest rose from 1471 tons that year to 4376 tons in 1929 and more than 15,608 tons two years later. Large-scale agriculture was introduced to the Esperance sand plain by an American syndicate, in partnership with the state government, in the 1960s following the discovery that adding superphosphate fertilisers containing trace elements to the poor soils made them suitable for cropping and pastoral activity. Despite early difficulties, the project eventually became a success and large areas of land were cleared during this time. The population of the town in 1968 was approximately 2,700. In 1979, pieces of the space station Skylab crashed onto Esperance after the craft broke up over the Indian Ocean. The municipality fined the United States $400 for littering.In 2004, the History Channel documentary \\"History Rocks\\" stated, in an episode covering major events of 1979, that this fine had not been paid. The fine was paid in April 2009, when radio show host Scott Barley of Highway Radio raised the funds from his morning show listeners, and paid the fine on behalf of NASA. Skylab's demise was an international media event, with merchandising, wagering on time and place of re-entry, and nightly news reports. The San Francisco Examiner offered a $10,000 prize for the first piece of Skylab to be delivered to their offices. Seventeen-year-old Stan Thornton scooped a few pieces of Skylab off the roof of his home in Esperance, caught the first flight to San Francisco, and collected the prize. In January 2007 Esperance experienced a storm with wind gusts of up to which brought of rainfall within 24 hours, causing significant flooding. More than 100 homes were damaged, several boats were destroyed, trees were felled, of bridge on the South Coast Highway, (the main road linking Esperance to Perth), was washed away, and power was cut from thousands of homes. The Western Australian Government declared the area a \\"natural disaster zone\\". At least 37,000 sheep were killed in the storm. Climate Esperance experiences a Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Csb) with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. It is subject to wide variations in the weather, from hot summer days when northerly winds arrive from the interior of the state, to cold, wet winter days with southerly winds from the Great Southern Ocean. Annually, the town has 85.5 clear days.  Economy= Esperance Port  Grain loading at Esperance Port Esperance has the only port in the south-east of Western Australia ‚Äì the Esperance Port Authority completed a A$54 million upgrade in 2002. The upgrade made the port one of the deepest in southern Australia, capable of handling Cape-class vessels (up to 180,000 tonnes) and fully loaded Panamax-class vessels (up to 75,000 tonnes). Exports for the year ending June 2005 were 7,694,155 tonnes, including 1.8 million tonnes of grain, and 5.5 million tonnes of iron ore which is railed from Koolyanobbing. =Lead and nickel contamination= In 2007, the deaths of thousands of wild birds alerted residents to a toxicity hazard which was found to be the unsafe transport by truck and rail of lead ore from Wiluna for export by ship. When elevated levels of lead were measured in a number of adults and children, as well as in water tanks, a multimillion-dollar cleanup was paid for by the state government. The miner, Magellan Metals, was banned from exporting lead through the port. A parliamentary inquiry presented its report in November 2007.Parliamentary Inquiry Report , November 2007, www.dec.wa.gov.au Before long, additional concerns were raised about pollution caused by nickel dust escaping from exported ore. In October 2008, the Esperance Port Authority banned the export of nickel after emission targets were exceeded twice, but the ban, which threatened Western Australia's $8 billion nickel industry, was overturned by the newly elected Premier of Western Australia, Colin Barnett.  Tourism  Esperance is renowned for its white sandy beaches and aqua coloured waters. Near the town itself are numerous beaches, offering surfing, scuba diving, and swimming. Also nearby are a number of salt lakes, including Pink Lake, which gains its rosy hue from red algae living within its waters. Esperance is also home to the Cyclops wave, said to be the world's heaviest wave with massive amounts of water unloading on shallow reef. Cyclops is featured in the surfing films Billabong Odyssey, and the Bra Boys documentary. There are five major national parks near the town. A major nearby tourist attraction, 20 minutes away from the town centre, is the Cape Le Grand National Park, which offers a picturesque coast of largely granite terrain and sheltered white sand beaches. The park is a popular spot for recreational fishing, as well as four wheel drive enthusiasts and hikers. Esperance also has a number of wind turbines supplying electricity to the town. Esperance had the first electrical wind farm in Australia, built at Salmon Beach as a research facility in 1987. In late 2007, a television advertisement promoting one of the newer Ferrari cars was filmed on Esperance's foreshore, to be shown overseas. In October 2020, a surfer who was a member of the local community in Esperance was killed by a shark at Wylie Bay near the town.Eliza Borrello and Emily Smith, 'Search suspended after shark attacks Esperance man Andrew Sharpe', ABC News, 11 October 2020. Education There are five primary schools in the region: Our Lady Star of the Sea Catholic Primary School, Castletown Primary School, Esperance Primary School, Nulsen Primary School and Esperance Christian Primary School. There are also two secondary schools: Esperance Senior High School and Esperance Anglican Community School. The Anglican school won an appeal in December 2009 against a State Government condition that limited it to grades 8‚Äì10; the school can now educate years 8‚Äì12. South Regional TAFE also has a campus in the town. Transport Esperance is at the southern end of the Coolgardie‚ÄìEsperance Highway and the eastern end of the South Coast Highway, both highways forming a part of Australia's Highway 1. The town is connected by public transport to Perth, Albany and Kalgoorlie via Transwa coach services GE1, GE2, GE3 and GE4. Regional Express Airlines has daily flights to/from Perth, arriving and departing from Esperance Airport. The Esperance-Perth route was previously serviced by Virgin Australia Regional Airlines and Skywest Airlines. The Esperance airport is also used for general aviation. The Esperance Branch Railway is a standard gauge railway line from Kalgoorlie to Esperance, linking the region to the Trans-Australian Railway and the Eastern Goldfields Railway. This is a freight-only railway and no passenger services currently run. Media A locally-printed lifestyle, entertainment and news magazine, Esperance Tide,Esperance Tide was first published in 2016 and is currently the only print publication in Esperance. It is published monthly, on the first Friday of the month. The local newspaper for the Esperance region is The Esperance Express, published by Fairfax Media.

The act authorized the construction of six frigates at a total cost of $688,888.82. These ships were the first ships of what eventually became the present-day United States Navy.Allen, G. Weld. (1909). Our naval war with France. Boston: Houghton Mifflin company, p.42 Purpose In August 1785, after the Revolutionary War drew to a close, Congress had sold , the last ship remaining in the Continental Navy due to a lack of funds to maintain the ship or support a navy. From 1785 until 1797, the United States' only armed maritime service was the Revenue Marine, founded in 1790 at the prompting of Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton.Allen 1909, pp. 41, 42 In 1785, two American merchant ships had been captured by the Muslim state of Algiers, and then Minister to France Thomas Jefferson began to urge the need for an American naval force to protect their passage through the Mediterranean. Jefferson's recommendations were initially met with indifference. However, Congress in 1786, and the Senate in 1791, discussed various proposals for a naval force, including estimates of costs for building frigates, but none were acted upon. Only in 1793, when Muslim pirates from Algiers had captured eleven additional merchant ships, was a proposal finally taken seriously.Allen 1909, p. 42 A bill was presented to the House of Representatives on January 20, 1794, providing for the construction of four ships to carry forty-four guns each, and two ships to carry thirty-six guns each ‚Äì by purchase or otherwise. The bill also provided pay and sustenance for naval officers, Marine officers, petty officers, sailors, and Marines, and outlined how each ship should be manned in order to operate them. Opposition to the bill was strong and a clause was added that should peace be established with Algiers the construction of the ships was to cease. Piracy had not been a problem when the American colonies were a part of the British Empire; the Royal Navy protected American vessels, since they belonged to subjects of the British Crown. After the American Revolutionary War, however, that protection was lost, and many foreign powers found that they could harass American merchant ships with impunity. Indeed, once the French Revolution started, Britain also started interdicting American merchant ships and there was little the fledgling American government could do about it. This was a major philosophical shift for the young Republic, many of whose leaders felt that a Navy would be too expensive to raise and maintain, too imperialistic, and would unnecessarily provoke the European powers. In the end, however, it was felt necessary to protect American interests at sea. In March 1796, as construction of the frigates slowly progressed, a peace accord was announced between the United States and Algiers. In accordance with clause nine of the Naval Act of 1794, a clause that specifically directed that construction of the frigates be discontinued if peace was established, construction on all six ships was halted. After some debate and prompting by President Washington, Congress passed an act on 20 April 1796, allowing the construction and funding to continue only on the three ships nearest to completion: , and .Allen 1909, p. 47 By late 1798 however, France began to seize American merchant vessels and the attempt at a diplomatic resolution had resulted in the XYZ Affair, prompting Congress to approve funds for completion of the remaining three frigates: , and .

She has often been confused with Elizabeth \\"Madame\\" Montour, her aunt or grandmother who was a noted interpreter and adviser to the governor, and with \\"Queen Esther\\" Montour, usually described as her sister.Sivertsen, 114. Sivertsen argues that Esther was not Catharine's sister, as is usually said, but a relative by marriage. Several places in western New York were later named in her honor, after most of the Iroquois had been forced to cede their lands and were driven out of the region. Early life Catherine was likely born in Pennsylvania or New York as the daughter of Marguerite Fafard Turpin, an Iroquois-French m√©tis also known as Margaret Montour or \\"French Margaret.\\" Margaret was either the daughter or niece of Madame Montour. Catherine's father was Katarioniecha, also known as Peter Quebec. He was described as a Caughnawaga Mohawk, referring to converted Catholic Mohawk who lived in the Jesuit mission village now known as Kahnawake. It was founded south of Montreal across the St. Lawrence River in Quebec in the early 18th century.Sivertsen, 110. Catherine had a sister named Mary (or Molly), and two brothers: Andrew Montour and Nicholas Quebec. (Her brother Andrew should not be confused with Andrew Montour (c. 1720‚Äì1772), who was the son of Elizabeth \\"Madame\\" Montour and was probably Catharine's uncle. He was a well-known interpreter in the backcountry of Pennsylvania and Virginia.) Marriage and family Catherine Montour married a Seneca chief named Telenemut, also known as Thomas Hudson. She and her husband lived in the Finger Lakes region at Queanettquaga, a Seneca town that became known as Catherine's Town. After the village was destroyed by rebel continental forces during the 1779 Sullivan Expedition in the American Revolutionary War, Montour relocated with other Seneca to Niagara. This area was held by the British at the time, although it later became part of New York state.Sivertsen, 112. When Schuyler County in western New York was settled by European Americans following the revolution and United States independence, they named several places after Catharine Montour. Historical references to Catherine in her later years are few. In 1791, Catherine's sister Mary sought permission to live at the Moravian mission village of New Salem, near present Milan, Ohio. Missionary David Zeisberger recorded at the time that Catherine Montour was still living near Niagara.Eugene F. Bliss, ed., Diary of David Zeisberger: A Moravian Missionary among the Indians of Ohio (Cincinnati: Clarke, 1885), 2:148‚Äì49. Representation in media \\"Catherine Montour\\" was the name of a fictional leading character of a 1917 silent film, The Spirit of '76.

He was recognized from a young age as being developed in both the theory (Abhidharma) and practice of Buddhism and so was revered as being scholarly. He wrote many books on Dhamma in Burmese and these were accessible even to a serious lay person, hence he was responsible for spreading Dhamma to all levels of society and reviving the traditional practice of vipassana meditation, making it more available for renunciates and lay people alike. Biography Sayadaw began his studies at age 20 in Mandalay at Thanjaun. While there he was considered to be a bright and ambitious young monk but his work was scholarly; there is no evidence that Sayadaw engaged in a serious meditation practice during his years in Mandalay. Leaving Mandalay after a great fire in 1883 caused the loss of his home and his written work to that time, Sayadaw returned to the village of his youth. Soon, Sayadaw founded a forest monastery in the \\"Ledi forest\\" and began practicing and teaching intensive meditation. It was from this monastery that he would take his name, Ledi Sayadaw, meaning \\"respected teacher of the Ledi forest.\\" In 1885, Ledi Sayadaw wrote the Nwa-myitta-sa (), a poetic prose letter that argued that Burmese Buddhists should not kill cattle and eat beef, since Burmese farmers depended on them as beasts of burden to maintain their livelihoods, that the marketing of beef for human consumption threatened the extinction of buffalo and cattle and that the practice was ecologically unsound. He subsequently led successful beef boycotts during the colonial era, despite the presence of beef eating among locals and influenced a generation of Burmese nationalists in adopting this stance. In 1900, Sayadaw gave up control of the monastery and pursued more focused meditation in the mountain caves near the banks of the Chindwin River. At other times he traveled throughout Burma. Because of his knowledge of pariyatti (theory), he was able to write many books on Dhamma in both Pali and Burmese languages such as, Paramattha-dipani (Manual of Ultimate Truth), Nirutta-dipani, a book on Pali grammar and The Manuals of Dhamma. At the same time he kept alive the pure tradition of patipatti (practice) by teaching the technique of Vipassana to a few people. Legacy Ledi Sayadaw was one of the foremost Burmese Buddhist figures of his age. He was instrumental in reviving the traditional practice of Vipassana, making it more available for renunciates and lay people alike. Many of his works are still available, including in English through the Buddhist Publication Society. After Ledi died in 1923, influential teachers, such as U Ba Khin, SN Goenka, Mahasi Sayadaw, and many others, spread the teachings to the West.

He was honored with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. He won two Pulitzer Prizes for his writing, and numerous other awards. Royster was famed for providing a conservative interpretation of the news every day, especially regarding economic issues.Richard Vetter, \\"Wall Street Journal,\\" in Bruce Frohnen, ed. American Conservatism (2006) pp. 898‚Äì99 Early life Although his life began and ended in Raleigh, North Carolina, the parts in between took him to the rest of the world. He was named after his paternal grandfather. His distinctive first and middle names were the result of a family tradition of using the names of states for offspring, begun by his great-grandfather. In addition to his grandfather's unusual name, his great-uncles were named Arkansas Delaware, Wisconsin Illinois, Oregon Minnesota, and Iowa Michigan Royster. They were usually called by their first and middle initials. These names were so unusual that for many years they were printed in the Ripley's Believe It or Not! series of books. Royster's father, Wilbur High Royster, owned and operated the Royster Candy Company in Raleigh, which in the early 1900s sold chocolate, peanut brittle, and other candies across the Carolinas and Virginia. His family also had a strong connection to the nearby University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Vermont's grandfather had taught Latin and Greek at the university, and his great-uncle Wisconsin Royster had helped create the medical school at UNC. Vermont was a cousin of bandleader and radio personality Kay Kyser. Career Royster was a 1935 graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; during his time at UNC he was a member of the Philanthropic Society and served as the editor of the student newspaper, The Daily Tar Heel. Soon after graduating, he moved to New York City and secured a job as a reporter for the New York City News Bureau, and a year later began his 61-year career with The Wall Street Journal. His career at Journal was one of steady advancement: reporter, 1936; Washington correspondent, 1936‚Äì40 and 1945‚Äì46; editorial writer and columnist, 1946‚Äì48; associate editor, 1948‚Äì51; senior associate editor, 1951‚Äì58; editor, 1958‚Äì71; contributing editor, columnist, 1971‚Äì96; editor emeritus, 1993-96. In 1940 Royster joined the United States Navy Reserve. During the Second World War he served as the captain of a US Navy destroyer, the USS Jack Miller, in the Pacific theater of the war. He rose to the rank of lieutenant commander in the Navy. The Jack Miller saw a considerable amount of combat against the Japanese Navy, and survived being caught in two typhoons. In early September 1945, Royster was among the first group of American officers to see the ruins of the Japanese city of Nagasaki, which had been destroyed by the second atomic bomb dropped on Japan. After the war ended Royster resumed his career at The Wall Street Journal. In 1953 Royster was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing. He served as president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors in 1965‚Äì66. He retired as editor of The Wall Street Journal in 1971 and began writing his popular weekly column Thinking Things Over, which he continued until the handicaps of old age forced him to discontinue it in 1986. He was awarded a second Pulitzer Prize, in 1984, for Commentary. After his retirement from the Journal, he became the Kenan Professor of Journalism and Public Affairs at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Honors When he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Ronald Reagan in 1986, the citation read: :For over half a century, as a journalist, author, and teacher, Vermont Royster illuminated the political and economic life of our times. His common sense exploded the pretensions of \\"expert opinion,\\" and his compelling eloquence warned of the evils of society loosed from its moorings in faith. The voice of the American people can be heard in his prose‚Äîhonest, open, proud, and free. Other awards he received include Distinguished Service Award, Sigma Delta Chi, 1958; William Allen White Award, University of Kansas, 1971; the 1975 Gerald Loeb Memorial Award for excellence in business and financial reporting; Elijah Lovejoy Award 1976; North Carolina Journalism Hall of Fame, 1980. In 1976, Royster received the Elijah Parish Lovejoy Award as well as an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Colby College. Several of the editorials he wrote are considered classics: The Desolate Wilderness along with And the Fair Land are now The Wall Street Journals traditional Thanksgiving editorials, and In Hoc Anno Domini appears every Christmas. Personal life Royster married Frances Claypoole in 1937, and the couple had two daughters, Francis and Eleanor. He died on July 22, 1996, and she followed two years later on April 23, 1998, both in Raleigh, North Carolina. He was 82 and she was 83. He is a cousin, through the Roysters, of Kay Kyser, a popular bandleader in the 1930s and 1940s.

Nicknamed \\"Chainsaw\\" for the way he cut through defences, he was also a good goal kicker. From South Canterbury in New Zealand, he began his professional rugby career at full back for the Highlanders in the Super 12. He played for Yamaha Jubilo in Japan at the end of his career. Scotland He was controversially rushed straight into the Scottish national team by the then national coach, Ian McGeechan just two days after he arrived from New Zealand. This annoyed many ex-Scottish internationals, particularly Gavin Hastings who voiced his feelings publicly, and this was hard for Laney who had hero-worshipped Hastings as a child. After the initial controversy died down, however, he became a popular figure with teammates and fans, through his personality and leadership. He also made his mark with Scotland, setting a new record of 24 points in a Six Nations game, and went on to equal Gavin Hastings‚Äô record of scoring 100 points in just nine Test matches. Perhaps most significantly, he contributed 11 points in the 21-6 defeat of the Springboks at Murrayfield in 2002, Scotland‚Äôs first win over one of the tri-nations teams in 20 years. His Scotland career was not without disappointment. After heavy criticism, Laney was left out of the Six Nations fixture against Ireland due to the \\"psychological effect of an injury\\" and was not to be seen in a Scotland jersey again. Edinburgh Rugby Laney played at flyhalf, centre and fullback for Edinburgh from 2001 to 2005. He played 76 times and scored 409 points from 15 tries, 69 penalties, 53 conversions and seven drop-goals. Japan Laney left Edinburgh for Yamaha Jubilo in March 2005.

The syndicated loan market is the dominant way for large corporations in the U.S. and Europe to receive loans from banks and other institutional financial capital providers. Financial law often regulates the industry. The U.S. market originated with the large leveraged buyout loans of the mid-1980s, and Europe's market blossomed with the launch of the euro in 1999. At the most basic level, arrangers serve the investment-banking role of raising investor funding for an issuer in need of capital. The issuer pays the arranger a fee for this service, and this fee increases with the complexity and risk factors of the loan. As a result, the most profitable loans are those to leveraged borrowers ‚Äî issuers whose credit ratings are speculative grade and who are paying spreads (premiums or margins above the relevant LIBOR in the U.S. and UK, Euribor in Europe or another base rate) sufficient to attract the interest of non-bank term loan investors. Though, this threshold moves up and down depending on market conditions. In the U.S., corporate borrowers and private equity sponsors fairly even-handedly drive debt issuance. Europe, however, has far less corporate activity and its issuance is dominated by private equity sponsors, who, in turn, determine many of the standards and practices of loan syndication. Loan market overview The retail market for a syndicated loan consists of banks and in the case of leveraged transactions, finance companies and institutional investors. The balance of power among these different investor groups is different in the U.S. than in Europe. The U.S. has a capital market where pricing is linked to credit quality and institutional investor appetite. In Europe, although institutional investors have increased their market presence over the past decade, banks remain a key part of the market. Consequently, pricing is not fully driven by capital market forces. In the U.S., market flex language drives initial pricing levels. Before formally launching a loan to these retail accounts, arrangers will often get a market read by informally polling select investors to gauge their appetite for the credit. After this market read, the arrangers will launch the deal at a spread and fee that it thinks will clear the market. Once the pricing, or the initial spread over a base rate (usually LIBOR), was set, it was largely fixed, except in the most extreme cases. If the loans were undersubscribed, the arrangers could very well be left above their desired hold level. Since the 1998 Russian financial crisis roiled the market, however, arrangers have adopted market-flex contractual language, which allows them to change the pricing of the loan based on investor demand ‚Äî in some cases within a predetermined range ‚Äî and to shift amounts between various tranches of a loan. This is now a standard feature of syndicated loan commitment letters. As a result of market flex, loan syndication functions as a book-building exercise, in bond-market parlance. A loan is originally launched to market at a target spread or, as was increasingly common by 2008 with a range of spreads referred to as price talk (i.e., a target spread of, say, LIBOR+250 to LIBOR+275). Investors then will make commitments that in many cases are tiered by the spread. For example, an account may put in for $25 million at LIBOR+275 or $15 million at LIBOR+250. At the end of the process, the arranger will total up the commitments and then make a call on where to price the paper. Following the example above, if the paper is vastly oversubscribed at LIBOR+250, the arranger may slice the spread further. Conversely, if it is undersubscribed even at LIBOR+275, then the arranger will be forced to raise the spread to bring more money to the table. In Europe, banks have historically dominated the debt markets because of the intrinsically regional nature of the arena. Regional banks have traditionally funded local and regional enterprises because they are familiar with regional issuers and can fund the local currency. Since the Eurozone was formed in 1998, the growth of the European leveraged loan market has been fuelled by the efficiency provided by this single currency as well as an overall growth in merger & acquisition (M&A;) activity, particularly leveraged buyouts due to private equity activity. Regional barriers (and sensitivities toward consolidation across borders) have fallen, economies have grown and the euro has helped to bridge currency gaps. As a result, in Europe, more and more leveraged buyouts have occurred over the past decade and, more significantly, they have grown in size as arrangers have been able to raise bigger pools of capital to support larger, multi-national transactions. To fuel this growing market, a broader array of banks from multiple regions now fund these deals, along with European institutional investors and U.S. institutional investors, resulting in the creation of a loan market that crosses the Atlantic. The European market has taken advantage of many of the lessons from the U.S. market, while maintaining its regional diversity. In Europe, the regional diversity allows banks to maintain a significant lending influence and fosters private equity's dominance in the market. Types of syndications Globally, there are three types of underwriting for syndications: an underwritten deal, best-efforts syndication, and a club deal. The European leveraged syndicated loan market almost exclusively consists of underwritten deals, whereas the U.S. market contains mostly best-efforts. Underwritten deal An underwritten deal is one for which the arrangers guarantee the entire commitment, then syndicate the loan. If the arrangers cannot fully subscribe the loan, they are forced to absorb the difference, which they may later try to sell to investors. This is easy, of course, if market conditions, or the credit's fundamentals, improve. If not, the arranger may be forced to sell at a discount and, potentially, even take a loss on the paper. Or the arranger may just be left above its desired hold level of the credit. Arrangers underwrite loans for several reasons. First, offering an underwritten loan can be a competitive tool to win mandates. Second, underwritten loans usually require more lucrative fees because the agent is on the hook if potential lenders balk. Of course, with flex-language now common, underwriting a deal does not carry the same risk it once did when the pricing was set in stone prior to syndication. Best- efforts syndication A best-efforts syndication is one for which the arranger group commits to underwrite less than or equal to the entire amount of the loan, leaving the credit to the vicissitudes of the market. If the loan is undersubscribed, the credit may not close ‚Äî or may need significant adjustments to its interest rate or credit rating to clear the market. Traditionally, best-efforts syndications were used for risky borrowers or for complex transactions. Since the late 1990s, however, the rapid acceptance of market-flex language has made best-efforts loans the rule even for investment- grade transactions. Club deal A club deal is a smaller loan ‚Äî usually $25‚Äí100 million, but as high as $150 million ‚Äî that is premarketed to a group of relationship lenders. The arranger is generally a first among equals, and each lender gets a full cut, or nearly a full cut, of the fees. The syndication process As a syndicated loan is a collection of bilateral loans between a borrower and several banks, the structure of the transaction is to isolate each bank's interest whilst maximising the collective efficiency of monitoring and enforcement of a single lender. The essence is to make loans on similar terms to make a bundle of loans into a single agreement. This draws upon Loan Market Association documents.Mugasha 'The Law of Multi-bank Financing' Chapters 1 and 3, (2007) OUP Correspondingly, three key actors operate within a syndicated lending: * Arranger * Agent * Trustee These actors utilise two core legal concepts to overcome the difficulty of large-cap lending, those being Agency and Trusts. A single bank may not on its own be willing or able to advance the whole amount. The essence of syndication is that two or more banks agree to make loans to a borrower on common terms governed by a single agreement. This agreement not only regulates the relationship between the lenders and the borrower but importantly between lenders. Most loans are documented using LMA precedents, in England, this will not be on the lenders' 'written standard terms of business' for the purposes of UCTA 1977.African Export-Import Bank v Shebah Exploration (2017) The distinction in the lending agreements, and use of the three aforementioned actors is primarily to avoid the creation of a partnership, avoid lenders from inadvertently acting as guarantors to one another ‚Äî or to prevent Set- off.Sempra Meals Ltd v IRC [2008] 1 AC 561, [74]-[100] The borrower is sometimes given a ‚ÄúYank the bank‚Äù power to force a transfer of a lenders interest in repayment (a chose in action) if the lender does not consent to a waiver or amendment. Lenders are traditionally limited in their decision- making by overlapping clauses requiring voting and collective decision-making. This acts as a disincentive for individual lenders to act in their own interests over the collective group. It has been suggested that the historical cooperation within the London loan market helped produce efficiency insolvency work-outs through the London Approach. Lending Terms There are several common types of lending terms, including implied terms in syndicated lending that affect the operation and coordination of lending behaviour. * Snooze-you- lose provision where lenders are required to submit their votes, these are contractual discretions which allow. These were found within several cases which regard terms relating to contractual discretions which must be exercised for the purposes which they are conferred. * Good Faith. Participants Within the banking sector, the role of setting up syndicated loans differ from deal to deal but generally a handful of key actors are consistent. These were the aforementioned key actors of the arranging bank, the agent, and the trustee. =Arranging Bank= The arranging bank acts as a salesman, and may be cannot exclude liability in its role of representing the agreement; either through misrepresentation, negligence, or breach of fiduciary duty. It may also be liable if it fails to do its best endeavours to acquire lending parties, these vary depending on the law of representation and fiduciary duty within national law.Sumitomo Bank Ltd v Bankque Bruxelles Lambert SA [1997] 1 Lloyds Rep 487; IFE Funds SA v Goldman Sachs International [2007] EWCA Civ 811; cf the extensive liability in Australian NatWest Australia Bank Ltd v Tricontinental Corp Ltd [1993] ATPR (Digest) Syndication is generally initiated by the grant of a mandate by the borrower to the arranging bank(s) or ‚Äòlead managers‚Äô setting out the financial terms of the proposed loan. The financial terms are set out in a ‚Äúterm sheet‚Äù which states the amount, term of the loan, repayment schedule, interest margin, fees any special terms, and a general statement that the loan will contain representations and warranties. This might include terms which relate to when the loan is to finance a company acquisition or a large infrastructure project, conferring interests in the lenders. Often term sheets are made to be expressly non-binding. However, in Maple Leaf Macro Volatility Master Fund v Rouvroy (2009) a loan term sheet was held to create a contract. =Agent= The core function of the Agent is to act as a conduit between the borrowers and the lenders. The agent owes contractual duties both to the borrower AND to the lenders. In TORRE ASSET FUNDING v RBS (2013) the mezzanine lenders alleged it was the Agent's duty to inform them of when an event of default occurred. The relationship of the agent tends not to be a fiduciary one.Mugasha 'The Law of Multi-bank Financing' Chapter 3, (2007) OUP The essence of a fiduciary relationship is that they may be reasonably expected to subordinate their own commercial interests to that of their beneficiary, in English law, this is not representative of a banking relationship. They are; * Not fiduciaries * No advisory duty as agent bank's duties are ‚Äòsolely mechanical and administrative in nature‚Äô. The agent bank's express duty, is to provide information designed to enable lenders to consider how to exercise their right under various facility agreements in relation to accelerating the debt, not to assist with ‚Äòexit‚Äô or liability for misstatements. As set out in Torre, the agent is typically a conduit between borrowers and lenders. They are typically described as solely technical and owe no fiduciary. They hold no duty to advise and are not liable for negligence. =Trustee= Security will usually be held by a trustee, as is common within Bond issuances on behalf of the lenders. This makes taking security easier, since there is a single chargee which is unlikely to change through the duration of the loan (through the secondary market). In jurisdictions where the trust is not recognised, it is often addressed by parallel debt provisions stating that the amount outstanding is deemed to be owing to the security trustee but will be reduced by any amounts actually received by the syndicate members. * Duty to enforce security under an event of default, or instruction by lenders * valuation and described as solely technical. They are fiduciary for lenders but not necessarily all lenders. Trustee duties cannot be fully excluded, core of that is fiduciary. Some discretion and good faith is sufficient. Statutory regulation is not desired, as doing so will likely limit the number willing trustees. Sub-participation There are normally no express restrictions on sub-participations. Banks usually exclude the requirement for consent if there has been an event of default to enable the bank to sell a defaulted loan without consent from the borrower. Similarly the requirement for consent is often excluded if the assignment is to an affiliate of an existing lender. Bank which has been a loan and not been repaid holds an asset comprising the debt of the borrower. Lead bank to engage in such asset sales relate inter alia to over exposure, regulatory capital requirements, liquidity, and arbitrage. Assignments may be permitted to assignees who satisfy stipulated criteria or who are included on a list of permitted assignees (a so-called ‚Äòwhite list‚Äô) or are not on a list of prohibited assignees (a ‚Äòblack list‚Äô). The borrower's liabilities are not to be increased as a result of an assignment or change of lending office: under the tax grossing-up or increased cost clauses. Syndicated credits generally contain a provision whereby a bank may novate its rights and obligations to another bank. The object of the novation is to ensure a transfer of obligations of the bank to lend; without this transfer releasing the original bank, the original bank may have a continuing credit exposure to the transferee bank if the transferee bank fails to make a new loan to the borrower when required by the loan agreement and this exposure may attract a capital adequacy requirement. Novation may amount to a complete substitution of the new bank or rather as an assignment of the rights of the old bank and the assumption by the new bank of obligations under the loan agreement plus the release of the old bank. The difference between the two is that a novation cancels old loans completely (which might have adverse effects on any security for the loan unless held by a trustee for the banks) whereas an assignment and assumption preserves the old loans and their security. Other obligations of a bank which may be transferred in this way are obligations to indemnify the agent and obligations under a pro rata sharing clause. In the case of assignments of rights, it may be a requirement that the assignee assumes these obligations to the existing banks. The contractual mechanics of the novation are that the agent bank is authorised by the borrower and the banks in the credit agreement to sign the scheduled novation certificates on behalf of the borrower and the banks so that all parties are bound.Habibsons Bank Ltd v Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) [2010] EWCA Civ 1335 Conflict between Lenders Four reasons can cause conflicts between lenders: =Co-ordination= Decision making requires coordination. Bonds are widely dispersed and the holder's identity is often unknown to the issuer or other bond holders due to the intermediate holding of securities. Scheme of arrangement require majority in number (head-count test) whereas if bonds are issued on a global note there is only one true creditor with sub participation through trusts. The solution to this problem is to develop inter-creditor agreements. To overcome the head-count test issues in bonds: bondholders can be given definite notes (although costly) or on the basis of this right be perceived as contingent-creditors. =Tragedy of the Commons= Hardin writes that Individual management and enforcement of the loans/bond increases individual monitoring costs, enforcement costs and facilities wealth destruction due to premature acceleration of loan/bond and enforcement of security. Collective issues can be addressed again by the inter-creditor agreements. Management and enforcement is in principle vested in a single individual in order to reduce monitoring costs and value distraction. This is a crucial concept within insolvency, which is primarily concerned with # BONDS: Individual action by bond holders is not allowed. This is personified by a no-action clause unless the trustee fails to enforce within a reasonable time of instruction. No-action clauses can be seen as a contractual variant of Vanderpitte procedure( a beneficiary can force a party to bring an action by bringing an action against the trustee). A bond trustee is obliged to enforce if; * event of default * certification of material prejudice * instruction from bond holders; and * satisfactory indemnity # SYNDICATED; Security trustees within these situations are obliged to enforce upon an event of default AND majority instructions. Individual action by a lender is possible because their rights are several and not joint. However, they do not have the benefit of security as it is vested in the strictly trustee. The result is that the realisation of the security to pay off the called debt (if not all parties are calling the debt) is shared severally pro rata. This discourages parties from realising the debt. This is found within a ‚Äòpro-rata sharing clause‚Äô by forcing individual lenders to share individual recoveries which reduces incentive to cut-the-line behaviour. =Tragedy of the anti- commons= As we have outlined above, veto-rights of individual bond holders/lenders can lead to sub-optimal outcomes. For example, a proper restructuring benefitting everyone is blocked. A solution to this problem is restrictions on agreements based on majorities. Majority can bind a minority, with the exception of some ‚Äòall lenders matters‚Äô. In case of loans, majority lenders typically defined as 50% or 75% of value based on commitments. Non- consenting banks can sometimes be forced to transfer. This was observed in the Yank-the-bank clause outlined above. =Minority oppression & Prisoners dilemma= Majority might oppress minority bond holders/lenders. Coordination problems lead to lenders to prefer sub-optimal options, because it is the safest option but not necessarily the best. Two forms of protections exist to prevent minority oppression. Several concepts have been outlined above and below, but it will be useful to be summarised here in order to appreciate the two primary methods of lenders within minority positions. # Transfer: Minority lenders who feel oppressed may choose to transfer their debts to other, although conflict might limit amount of willing buyers to reduce price of the loan/bonds # Implied term: It is an implied term in loan and bond agreements that the majority must act in good faith and for the purpose of benefiting the class as a whole.Redwood Master Fund Ltd v TD Bank Europe Ltd Subject to the express terms of contract. Where there are different classes, there is no need to vote in interests of the creditor as a whole. Therefore, in last years exam, the subordinated nature of the second lender meant that there was a different class and the first group could call the debt without consequence of the second group being hesitant. Leveraged Transaction Leveraged transactions fund a number of purposes. They provide support for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures, working capital, and expansion. They refinance the existing capital structure or support a full recapitalization including, not infrequently, the payment of a dividend to the equity holders. They provide funding to corporations undergoing restructurings, including bankruptcy, in the form of super senior loans also known as debtor in possession (DIP) loans. Their primary purpose, however, is to fund M&A; activity, specifically leveraged buyouts, where the buyer uses the debt markets to acquire the acquisition target's equity. In the U.S., the core of leveraged lending comes from buyouts resulting from corporate activity, while, in Europe, private equity funds drive buyouts. In the U.S., all private equity related activities, including refinancings and recapitalizations, are called sponsored transactions; in Europe, they are referred to as LBOs. A buyout transaction originates well before lenders see the transaction's terms. In a buyout, the company is first put up for auction. With sponsored transactions, a company that is for the first time up for sale to private equity sponsors is a primary LBO; a secondary LBO is one that is going from one sponsor to another sponsor, and a tertiary is one that is going for the second time from sponsor to sponsor. A public-to-private transaction (P2P) occurs when a company is going from the public domain to a private equity sponsor. As prospective acquirers are evaluating target companies, they are also lining up debt financing. A staple financing package may be on offer as part of the sale process. By the time the auction winner is announced, that acquirer usually has funds linked up via a financing package funded by its designated arranger, or, in Europe, mandated lead arranger (MLA). Before awarding a mandate, an issuer might solicit bids from arrangers. The banks will outline their syndication strategy and qualifications, as well as their view on the way the loan will price in market. Once the mandate is awarded, the syndication process starts. In Europe, where mezzanine capital funding is a market standard, issuers may choose to pursue a dual track approach to syndication whereby the MLAs handle the senior debt and a specialist mezzanine fund oversees placement of the subordinated mezzanine position. The arranger will prepare an information memo (IM) describing the terms of the transactions. The IM typically will include an executive summary, investment considerations, a list of terms and conditions, an industry overview, and a financial model. Because loans are unregistered securities, this will be a confidential offering made only to qualified banks and accredited investors. If the issuer is speculative grade and seeking capital from nonbank investors, the arranger will often prepare a \\"public\\" version of the IM. This version will be stripped of all confidential material such as management financial projections so that it can be viewed by accounts that operate on the public side of the wall or that want to preserve their ability to buy bonds or stock or other public securities of the particular issuer (see the Public Versus Private section below). Naturally, investors that view materially nonpublic information of a company are disqualified from buying the company's public securities for some period of time. As the IM (or \\"bank book\\", in traditional market lingo) is being prepared, the syndicate desk will solicit informal feedback from potential investors on what their appetite for the deal will be and at what price they are willing to invest. Once this intelligence has been gathered, the agent will formally market the deal to potential investors. The executive summary will include a description of the issuer, an overview of the transaction and rationale, sources and uses, and key statistics on the financials. Investment considerations will be, basically, management's sales \\"pitch\\" for the deal. The list of terms and conditions will be a preliminary term sheet describing the pricing, structure, collateral, covenants, and other terms of the credit (covenants are usually negotiated in detail after the arranger receives investor feedback). The industry overview will be a description of the company's industry and competitive position relative to its industry peers. The financial model will be a detailed model of the issuer's historical, pro forma, and projected financials including management's high, low, and base case for the issuer. Most new acquisition-related loans are kicked off at a bank meeting at which potential lenders hear management and the sponsor group (if there is one) describe what the terms of the loan are and what transaction it backs. Management will provide its vision for the transaction and, most importantly, tell why and how the lenders will be repaid on or ahead of schedule. In addition, investors will be briefed regarding the multiple exit strategies, including second ways out via asset sales. (If it is a small deal or a refinancing instead of a formal meeting, there may be a series of calls or one-on-one meetings with potential investors.) In Europe, the syndication process has multiple steps reflecting the complexities of selling down through regional banks and investors. The roles of each of the players in each of the phases are based on their relationships in the market and access to paper. On the arrangers‚Äô side, the players are determined by how well they can access capital in the market and bring in lenders. On the lenders' side, it is about getting access to as many deals as possible. There are three primary phases of syndication in Europe. During the underwriting phase, the sponsor or corporate borrowers designate the MLA (or the group of MLAs) and the deal is initially underwritten. During the sub-underwriting phases, other arrangers are brought into the deal. In general syndication, the transaction is opened up to the institutional investor market, along with other banks that are interested in participating. In the U.S. and in Europe, once the loan is closed, the final terms are then documented in detailed credit and security agreements. Subsequently, liens are perfected and collateral is attached. Loans, by their nature, are flexible documents that can be revised and amended from time to time after they have closed. These amendments require different levels of approval. Amendments can range from something as simple as a covenant waiver to something as complex as a change in the collateral package or allowing the issuer to stretch out its payments or make an acquisition. Loan market participants There are three primary- investor constituencies: banks, finance companies, and institutional investors; in Europe, only the banks and institutional investors are active. In Europe, the banking segment is almost exclusively made up of commercial banks, while in the U.S. it is much more diverse and can involve commercial and investments banks, business development corporations or finance companies, and institutional investors such as asset managers, insurance companies and loan mutual funds and loan ETFs. As in Europe, commercial banks in the U.S. provide the vast majority of investment-grade loans. These are typically large revolving credits that back commercial paper or are used for general corporate purposes or, in some cases, acquisitions. For leveraged loans, considered non- investment grade risk, U.S. and European banks typically provide the revolving credits, letters of credit (L/Cs), and ‚Äî although they are becoming increasingly less common ‚Äî fully amortizing term loans known as \\"Term Loan A\\" under a syndicated loan agreement while institutions provide the partially amortizing term loans known a \\"Term Loan B\\". Finance companies have consistently represented less than 10% of the leveraged loan market, and tend to play in smaller deals ‚Äî $25‚Äì200 million. These investors often seek asset- based loans that carry wide spreads and that often feature time-intensive collateral monitoring. Institutional investors in the loan market are principally structured vehicles known as collateralized loan obligations (CLO) and loan participation mutual funds (known as \\"prime funds\\" because they were originally pitched to investors as a money-market-like fund that would approximate the prime rate) also play a large role. Although U.S. prime funds do make allocations to the European loan market, there is no European version of prime funds because European regulatory bodies, such as the Financial Services Authority (FSA) in the U.K., have not approved loans for retail investors. In addition, hedge funds, high-yield bond funds, pension funds, insurance companies, and other proprietary investors do participate opportunistically in loans. Typically, however, they invest principally in wide-margin loans (referred to by some players as \\"high-octane\\" loans), with spreads of 500 basis points or higher over the base rate. CLOs are special- purpose vehicles set up to hold and manage pools of leveraged loans. The special-purpose vehicle is financed with several tranches of debt (typically a ‚ÄòAAA‚Äô rated tranche, a ‚ÄòAA‚Äô tranche, a ‚ÄòBBB‚Äô tranche, and a mezzanine tranche with a non-investment grade rating) that have rights to the collateral and payment stream in descending order. In addition, there is an equity tranche, but the equity tranche is usually not rated. CLOs are created as arbitrage vehicles that generate equity returns through leverage, by issuing debt 10 to 11 times their equity contribution. There are also market-value CLOs that are less leveraged ‚Äî typically three to five times ‚Äî and allow managers more flexibility than more tightly structured arbitrage deals. CLOs are usually rated by two of the three major ratings agencies and impose a series of covenant tests on collateral managers, including minimum rating, industry diversification, and maximum default basket. In U.S., before the financial crisis in 2007‚Äì2008, CLOs had become the dominant form of institutional investment in the leveraged loan market taking a commanding 60% of primary activity by institutional investors by 2007. But when the structured finance market cratered in late 2007, CLO issuance tumbled and by mid-2008, the CLO share had fallen to 40%. In 2014 CLO issuance has demonstrated a full recovery with issuance of $90 billion by August, an amount that effectively equals the previous record set in 2007. Projections on total issuance for 2014 are as high as $125 billion. In Europe, over the past few years, other vehicles such as credit funds have begun to appear on the market. Credit funds are open- ended pools of debt investments. Unlike CLOs, however, they are not subject to ratings oversight or restrictions regarding industry or ratings diversification. They are generally lightly levered (two or three times), allow managers significant freedom in picking and choosing investments, and are subject to being marked to market. In addition, in Europe, mezzanine funds play a significant role in the loan market. Mezzanine funds are also investment pools, which traditionally focused on the mezzanine market only. However, when second lien entered the market, it eroded the mezzanine market; consequently, mezzanine funds expanded their investment universe and began to commit to second lien as well as payment-in-kind (PIK) portions of transaction. As with credit funds, these pools are not subject to ratings oversight or diversification requirements, and allow managers significant freedom in picking and choosing investments. Mezzanine funds are, however, riskier than credit funds in that they carry both debt and equity characteristics. Retail investors can access the loan market through prime funds. Prime funds were first introduced in the late 1980s. Most of the original prime funds were continuously offered funds with quarterly tender periods. Managers then rolled true closed-end, exchange-traded funds in the early 1990s. It was not until the early 2000s that fund complexes introduced open-ended funds that were redeemable each day. While quarterly redemption funds and closed-end funds remained the standard because the secondary loan market does not offer the rich liquidity that is supportive of open-end funds, the open-end funds had sufficiently raised their profile that by mid-2008 they accounted for 15-20% of the loan assets held by mutual funds. As the ranks of institutional investors have grown over the years, the loan markets have changed to support their growth. Institutional term loans have become commonplace in a credit structure. Secondary trading is a routine activity and mark-to-market pricing as well as leveraged loan indexes have become portfolio management standards. Credit facilities Syndicated loans facilities (credit facilities) are basically financial assistance programs that are designed to help financial institutions and other institutional investors to draw notional amount as per the requirement. There are four main types of syndicated loan facilities: a revolving credit; a term loan; an L/C; and an acquisition or equipment line (a delayed-draw term loan). A revolving credit line allows borrowers to draw down, repay and reborrow as often as necessary. The facility acts much like a corporate credit card, except that borrowers are charged an annual commitment fee on unused amounts, which drives up the overall cost of borrowing (the facility fee). In the U.S., many revolvers to speculative-grade issuers are asset-based and thus tied to borrowing-base lending formulas that limit borrowers to a certain percentage of collateral, most often receivables and inventory. In Europe, revolvers are primarily designated to fund working capital or capital expenditures (capex). A term loan is simply an installment loan, such as a loan one would use to buy a car. The borrower may draw on the loan during a short commitment period and repay it based on either a scheduled series of repayments or a one-time lump-sum payment at maturity (bullet payment). There are two principal types of term loans: an amortizing term loan and an institutional term loan. An amortizing term loan (A-term loan or TLA) is a term loan with a progressive repayment schedule that typically runs six years or less. These loans are normally syndicated to banks along with revolving credits as part of a larger syndication. In the U.S., A-term loans have become increasingly rare over the years as issuers bypassed the bank market and tapped institutional investors for all or most of their funded loans. An institutional term loan (B-term, C-term or D-term loan) is a term-loan facility with a portion carved out for nonbank, institutional investors. These loans became more common as the institutional loan investor base grew in the U.S. and Europe. These loans are priced higher than amortizing term loans because they have longer maturities and bullet repayment schedules. This institutional category also includes second-lien loans and covenant-lite loans. Regulatory compliance The Shared National Credit Program was established in 1977 by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to provide an efficient and consistent review and classification of any large syndicated loan. As of January 1, 2018, the program covers any loan or loan complaint of at least $100 million that is shared by three or more supervised institutions. The agencies' review is conducted annually, reporting after third quarter examinations and reflecting data as of June 30.Agencies announce Shared National Credit definition change References=NotesBibliography * Signoriello, Vincent J.

Complex event processing, or CEP, consists of a set of concepts and techniques developed in the early 1990s for processing real-time events and extracting information from event streams as they arrive. The goal of complex event processing is to identify meaningful events (such as opportunities or threats) in real-time situations and respond to them as quickly as possible. These events may be happening across the various layers of an organization as sales leads, orders or customer service calls. Or, they may be news items, text messages, social media posts, stock market feeds, traffic reports, weather reports, or other kinds of data. An event may also be defined as a \\"change of state,\\" when a measurement exceeds a predefined threshold of time, temperature, or other value. Analysts have suggested that CEP will give organizations a new way to analyze patterns in real-time and help the business side communicate better with IT and service departments. CEP has since become an enabling technology in many systems that are used to take immediate action in response to incoming streams of events. Applications are now to be found (2018) in many sectors of business including stock market trading systems, mobile devices, internet operations, fraud detection, the transportation industry, and governmental intelligence gathering. The vast amount of information available about events is sometimes referred to as the event cloud. Conceptual description Among thousands of incoming events, a monitoring system may for instance receive the following three from the same source: # church bells ringing. # the appearance of a man in a tuxedo with a woman in a flowing white gown. # rice flying through the air. From these events the monitoring system may infer a complex event: a wedding. CEP as a technique helps discover complex events by analyzing and correlating other events:D. Luckham, \\"The Power of Events: An Introduction to Complex Event Processing in Distributed Enterprise Systems\\", Addison-Wesley, 2002. the bells, the man and woman in wedding attire and the rice flying through the air. CEP relies on a number of techniques,O. Etzion and P. Niblett, \\"Event Processing in Action\\", Manning Publications, 2010. including: * Event-pattern detection * Event abstraction * Event filtering * Event aggregation and transformation * Modeling event hierarchies * Detecting relationships (such as causality, membership or timing) between events * Abstracting event-driven processes Commercial applications of CEP exist in variety of industries and include algorithmic stock-trading,Complex Event Processing for Trading, FIXGlobal, June 2011 the detection of credit-card fraud, business activity monitoring, and security monitoring. Details of commercial products and use cases History The CEP area has roots in discrete event simulation, the active database area and some programming languages. The activity in the industry was preceded by a wave of research projects in the 1990s. According to the first project that paved the way to a generic CEP language and execution model was the Rapide project in Stanford University, directed by David Luckham. In parallel there have been two other research projects: Infospheres in California Institute of Technology, directed by K. Mani Chandy, and Apama in University of Cambridge directed by John Bates. The commercial products were dependents of the concepts developed in these and some later research projects. Community efforts started in a series of event processing symposiums organized by the Event Processing Technical Society, and later by the ACM DEBS conference series. One of the community efforts was to produce the event processing manifesto. Related concepts CEP is used in operational intelligence (OI) products to provide insight into business operations by running query analysis against live feeds and event data. OI collects real-time data and correlates against historical data to provide insight and analysis. Multiple sources of data can be combined to provide a common operating picture that uses current information. In network management, systems management, application management and service management, people usually refer instead to event correlation. As CEP engines, event correlation engines (event correlators) analyze a mass of events, pinpoint the most significant ones, and trigger actions. However, most of them do not produce new inferred events. Instead, they relate high-level events with low-level events.J.P. Martin-Flatin, G. Jakobson and L. Lewis, \\"Event Correlation in Integrated Management: Lessons Learned and Outlook\\", Journal of Network and Systems Management, Vol. 17, No. 4, December 2007. Inference engines, e.g., rule-based reasoning engines, typically produce inferred information in artificial intelligence. However, they do not usually produce new information in the form of complex (i.e., inferred) events. Example A more systemic example of CEP involves a car, some sensors and various events and reactions. Imagine that a car has several sensors‚Äîone that measures tire pressure, one that measures speed, and one that detects if someone sits on a seat or leaves a seat. In the first situation, the car is moving and the pressure of one of the tires moves from 45 psi to 41 psi over 15 minutes. As the pressure in the tire is decreasing, a series of events containing the tire pressure is generated. In addition, a series of events containing the speed of the car is generated. The car's Event Processor may detect a situation whereby a loss of tire pressure over a relatively long period of time results in the creation of the \\"lossOfTirePressure\\" event. This new event may trigger a reaction process to note the pressure loss into the car's maintenance log, and alert the driver via the car's portal that the tire pressure has reduced. In the second situation, the car is moving and the pressure of one of the tires drops from 45 psi to 20 psi in 5 seconds. A different situation is detected‚Äîperhaps because the loss of pressure occurred over a shorter period of time, or perhaps because the difference in values between each event were larger than a predefined limit. The different situation results in a new event \\"blowOutTire\\" being generated. This new event triggers a different reaction process to immediately alert the driver and to initiate onboard computer routines to assist the driver in bringing the car to a stop without losing control through skidding. In addition, events that represent detected situations can also be combined with other events in order to detect more complex situations. For example, in the final situation the car is moving normally and suffers a blown tire which results in the car leaving the road and striking a tree, and the driver is thrown from the car. A series of different situations are rapidly detected. The combination of \\"blowOutTire\\", \\"zeroSpeed\\" and \\"driverLeftSeat\\" within a very short period of time results in a new situation being detected: \\"occupantThrownAccident\\". Even though there is no direct measurement that can determine conclusively that the driver was thrown, or that there was an accident, the combination of events allows the situation to be detected and a new event to be created to signify the detected situation. This is the essence of a complex (or composite) event. It is complex because one cannot directly detect the situation; one has to infer or deduce that the situation has occurred from a combination of other events. Integration with business process management A natural fit for CEP has been with business process management (BPM).C. Janiesch, M. Matzner and O. M√ºller: \\"A Blueprint for Event-Driven Business Activity Management\\", Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2011, Volume 6896/2011, 17-28, BPM focuses on end-to-end business processes, in order to continuously optimize and align for its operational environment. However, the optimization of a business does not rely solely upon its individual, end-to-end processes. Seemingly disparate processes can affect each other significantly. Consider this scenario: In the aerospace industry, it is good practice to monitor breakdowns of vehicles to look for trends (determine potential weaknesses in manufacturing processes, material, etc.). Another separate process monitors current operational vehicles' life cycles and decommissions them when appropriate. One use for CEP is to link these separate processes, so that in the case of the initial process (breakdown monitoring) discovering a malfunction based on metal fatigue (a significant event), an action can be created to exploit the second process (life cycle) to issue a recall on vehicles using the same batch of metal discovered as faulty in the initial process. The integration of CEP and BPM must exist at two levels, both at the business awareness level (users must understand the potential holistic benefits of their individual processes) and also at the technological level (there needs to be a method by which CEP can interact with BPM implementation). For a recent state of the art review on the integration of CEP with BPM, which is frequently labeled as Event-Driven Business Process Management, refer to.J. Krumeich, B. Weis, D. Werth and P. Loos: \\"Event-Driven Business Process Management: where are we now?: A comprehensive synthesis and analysis of literature\\", Business Process Management Journal, 2014, Volume 20, 615-633, Computation-oriented CEP's role can arguably be seen to overlap with Business Rule technology. For example, customer service centers are using CEP for click-stream analysis and customer experience management. CEP software can factor real-time information about millions of events (clicks or other interactions) per second into business intelligence and other decision-support applications. These \\"recommendation applications\\" help agents provide personalized service based on each customer's experience. The CEP application may collect data about what customers on the phone are currently doing, or how they have recently interacted with the company in other various channels, including in-branch, or on the Web via self-service features, instant messaging and email. The application then analyzes the total customer experience and recommends scripts or next steps that guide the agent on the phone, and hopefully keep the customer happy. In financial services The financial services industry was an early adopter of CEP technology, using complex event processing to structure and contextualize available data so that it could inform trading behavior, specifically algorithmic trading, by identifying opportunities or threats that indicate traders (or automatic trading systems) should buy or sell. For example, if a trader wants to track stocks that have five up movements followed by four down movements, CEP technology can track such an event. CEP technology can also track drastic rise and fall in number of trades. Algorithmic trading is already a practice in stock trading. It is estimated that around 60% of Equity trading in the United States is by way of algorithmic trades. CEP is expected to continue to help financial institutions improve their algorithms and be more efficient. Recent improvements in CEP technologies have made it more affordable, helping smaller firms to create trading algorithms of their own and compete with larger firms. CEP has evolved from an emerging technology to an essential platform of many capital markets. The technology's most consistent growth has been in banking, serving fraud detection, online banking, and multichannel marketing initiatives. Today, a wide variety of financial applications use CEP, including profit, loss, and risk management systems, order and liquidity analysis, quantitative trading and signal generation systems, and others. Integration with time series databases A time series database is a software system that is optimized for the handling of data organized by time. Time series are finite or infinite sequences of data items, where each item has an associated timestamp and the sequence of timestamps is non-decreasing. Elements of a time series are often called ticks. The timestamps are not required to be ascending (merely non-decreasing) because in practice the time resolution of some systems such as financial data sources can be quite low (milliseconds, microseconds or even nanoseconds), so consecutive events may carry equal timestamps. Time series data provides a historical context to the analysis typically associated with complex event processing. This can apply to any vertical industry such as finance and cooperatively with other technologies such as BPM. Consider the scenario in finance where there is a need to understand historic price volatility to determine statistical thresholds of future price movements. This is helpful for both trade models and transaction cost analysis. The ideal case for CEP analysis is to view historical time series and real-time streaming data as a single time continuum. What happened yesterday, last week or last month is simply an extension of what is occurring today and what may occur in the future. An example may involve comparing current market volumes to historic volumes, prices and volatility for trade execution logic. Or the need to act upon live market prices may involve comparisons to benchmarks that include sector and index movements, whose intra-day and historic trends gauge volatility and smooth outliers. Internet of Things and Smart Cyber-physical systems Complex event processing is a key enabler in Internet of Things (IoT) settings and Smart Cyber-physical systems (CPS) as well. Processing dense and heterogeneous streams from various sensors and matching patterns against those streams is a typical task in such cases. The majority of these techniques rely on the fact that representing the IoT system's state and its changes is more efficient in the form of a data stream, instead of having a static, materialized model. Reasoning over such stream-based models fundamentally differs from traditional reasoning techniques and typically require the combination of model transformations and CEP.I. D√°vid, I. R√°th, D.

The Cleveland East Ohio Gas Explosion occurred on the afternoon of Friday, October 20, 1944. The resulting gas leak, explosion and fires killed 130 people and destroyed a one-square-mile area of the east side of Cleveland, Ohio. History The East Ohio Gas Company built a full-scale commercial liquid natural gas (LNG) plant in Cleveland, Ohio in 1940, just after a successful pilot plant was built by its sister company, Hope Natural Gas Company of West Virginia. This was the first such plant in the world. Originally it had three spheres, approximately 63 feet in diameter containing LNG at ‚àí260 ¬∞F. Each sphere held the equivalent of about 50 million cubic feet of natural gas. A fourth tank, a cylinder, was added in 1942. It had an equivalent capacity of 100 million cubic feet of gas. The plant operated successfully for three years. The stored gas was regasified and put into the mains when cold snaps hit and extra capacity was needed; formerly, some customers' gas service was curtailed during a cold snap. The disaster At 2:30 p.m. on the afternoon of Friday, October 20, 1944, the cylindrical above- ground storage tank number 4, holding liquefied natural gas in the East Ohio Gas Company's tank farm, began to emit a vapor that poured from a seam on the side of the tank. The tank was located near Lake Erie on East 61st Street, and winds from the lake pushed the vapor into a mixed-use section of Cleveland, where it dropped into the sewer lines via the catch basins located in the street gutters. As the gas mixture flowed and mixed with air and sewer gas, the mixture ignited. In the ensuing explosion, manhole covers launched skyward as jets of fire erupted from depths of the sewer lines. One manhole cover was found several miles east in the Cleveland neighborhood of Glenville. At first it was thought that the disaster was contained, and spectators returned home thinking that the matter was being taken care of by the fire department. At 3:00 p.m., a second above-ground tank exploded, leveling the tank farm. However, the explosions and fires continued to occur, trapping many who had returned to what they thought was the safety of their own homes. Housewives who were at home suddenly found their homes engulfed in flame as the explosion traveled through the sewers and up through drains. The following day, Associated Press wire stories contained quotes from survivors, many of whom were at home cleaning in preparation for the coming Sabbath. Survivors said that within a split second after the explosion, their homes and clothes were on fire. Cuyahoga County Coroner Dr. Samuel Gerber estimated that the initial death toll stood at 200; however, Gerber was quoted in newspaper wire stories stating the magnitude of the fire and the intense temperatures had the power to vaporize human flesh and bone, making an exact count impossible until weeks after the disaster. The final death toll was lower than the coroner's initial estimates. The toll could have been significantly higher had the event occurred after local schools had let out and working parents returned to their homes for the evening. In all over 600 people were left homeless, and seventy homes, two factories, numerous cars and miles of underground infrastructure destroyed. Following the explosions and fires, East Ohio Gas worked to assure the public that the destroyed plant held only 24 hours' worth of gas for the city. Many families living in the area not only lost their homes, but stocks, bonds and cash, which many kept at home. Estimates for destroyed personal and industrial property ranged between $7 to $15 million. The explosion also had a long-range impact on the natural gas industry. Until the disaster, above- ground low-pressure storage of natural gas, used as fuel for homes, office buildings and factories, was a common sight in cities across America. Following the disaster, utility companies and communities began to rethink their natural gas storage systems, and below-ground storage of natural gas grew in popularity. The disaster plays a major role in Don Robertson's 1965 novel \\"The Greatest Thing Since Sliced Bread\\" and also in Sebastian Barry's novel On Canaan's Side published in 2011. The East Ohio Gas Explosion was calculated to equal a 2.43 kt TNT explosion or 1/6 of the Hiroshima atomic bomb.

Michael Noll's computer art exhibition, Computer-Generated Pictures, held at the Howard Wise Gallery, New York City, in 1965 B√©la Julesz (also Bela Julesz in English; February 19, 1928 - December 31, 2003) was a Hungarian-born American visual neuroscientist and experimental psychologist in the fields of visual and auditory perception. Julesz was the originator of random dot stereograms which led to the creation of autostereograms. He also was the first to study texture discrimination by constraining second-order statistics. Biography B√©la Julesz was born in Budapest, Hungary, on February 19, 1928. He immigrated to the United States with his wife Margit after receiving his Ph.D. from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1956. Although B√©la is the Hungarian name with the accent, Julesz always used the non-accented version. In 1956, Julesz joined the renowned Bell Laboratories, where he headed the Sensory and Perceptual Processes Department (1964‚Äì1982), then the Visual Perception Research Department (1983‚Äì1989). Much of his research focused on physiological psychology topics including depth perception and pattern recognition within the visual system. In 1959, Julesz created the random-dot stereogram using pairs of random dot patterns that were identical except for slight differences in the horizontal position of a subset of dots. When these patterns were viewed one to each eye via a stereoscope, the subset of dots appeared to be at a different depth from the remainder. Julesz referred to this, whimsically, as cyclopean vision, after the mythical Cyclopes, creatures with a single eye in their forehead instead of the usual two. This was because the shape of the depth area was invisible to either eye separately; it is visible only to the cyclopean eye of stereoscopic perception that combines the information from the two eyes. Later, Christopher Tyler, a former student of Julesz, used the principles of random-dot stereograms to invent autostereograms, which create the same effect using a single image instead of two. Julesz made important contributions to the theory of human visual perception of texture. In 1962 he originated the Julesz Conjecture, which states that humans cannot distinguish between textures with identical second-order statistics. In 1973, he proved this conjecture false, though the concept that image textures could be modeled based on low-order statistics remained. In 1981, he originated the Texton Theory, which states that textons, composed of local image features, are \\"the putative units of pre-attentive human texture perception\\". In 1989, he retired from Bell Labs and began teaching in the Psychology department at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey. It was there that he established and directed the Laboratory of Vision Research, which was dedicated to investigating mechanisms of stereopsis, motion, binocular vision, texture perception and attention. The lab helped establish cognitive science, neuroscience, and vision science as important fields of study at Rutgers. Julesz became professor emeritus in 1999, and remained the director of the lab until his death on December 31, 2003. Education * 1956 - Ph.D., Hungarian Academy of Sciences * 1950 - Electrical Engineering, Technical University, Budapest Publications B√©la Julesz authored or collaborated on more than 200 publications, including Foundations of Cyclopean Perception (1971).

By means of another State law, the city of Tatu√≠ was nominated ‚ÄúThe Capital of Music‚Äù in Brazil, due to the Conservatory's relevant performance in both artistic and pedagogic work. Known as a center of excellence in music teaching in Latin America, the conservatory is located in the city of Tatu√≠, a pleasant town with a population of 117,000 inhabitants and situated 130 km from the capital of the state, S√£o Paulo. The conservatory includes in its student body more than 3.000 youngsters from over 20 states in Brazil, and 67 from various countries, such as Peru, Paraguay, France, Japan and the United States. All courses offered are tuition-free, and for those students who come from distant places in Brazil or from other countries, free room and board may also be offered. Some of the conservatory's former music students now belong to OSESP, Latin America's leading symphony orchestra, conducted by Pascal Tortelier, as well as other Brazilian symphonic groups. Many students have been awarded scholarships for study in the United States, where some of them now teach at local universities and/or play in various orchestras there, as well as in France and the United Kingdom. One such grant from the Karajan Foundation was given to at least two former students member of the Conservat√≥rio de Tatu√≠. Among past alumni now performing and teaching successfully abroad is the acclaimed cellist Dr. Tania Lisboa, a permanent member of the Royal College of Music in London. Other students now residing and working professionally in Austria and Germany include Luis Garcia a former permanent horn player of the Berlin Staatskapelle under conductor Daniel Barenboim. The Conservatorio de Tatui is administered by its executive director, Prof. Dr. Henrique Autran Dourado (New England Conservatory of Music of Boston, USA), administrative and financial director, Dalmo Defensor (Economist at the University of S√£o Paulo), pedagogic assistant, Antonio Ribeiro (State University of S√£o Paulo, composer and researcher), and artistic assistant, Erik Heimann (Trinity College of London). The Conservatory's music hall (Teatro Procopio Ferreira) presents over 300 performances per year, such as symphonic, jazz, Brazilian popular music, drama and shows. Events include various international festivals, such as the S√£o Paulo version of RICE (Rio International Cello Encounter), International Early Music Encounter, and competitions such as the National Violin Making Concours, Spartaco Rossi Piano Competition among many others. At least, one master class is performed in the Theater, weekly, and guest conductors and soloists from other states and countries are frequently invited to perform with the Conservatory's Symphony Orchestra and Wind Ensemble. Sports Besides music, soccer is another great passion of the tatuians people, and they stand out among the elite four: * Clube de Campo * S√£o Martinho * Santa Cruz * XI de Agosto * Realmatismo Esporte Clube Famous residents *Mario Longhi, CEO of United States Steel from 2013 to 2017. *Celso de Mello, Brazilian Supreme Court justice http://www.stf.jus.br/portal/ministro/verMinistro.asp?periodo=stf&id;=28 ReferencesExternal links * http://www.tatui.sp.gov.br/ * http://www.aeroclubedetatui.com.br ","title":"Tatu√≠"},{"id":"1357071","text":"Hell for Certain is an unincorporated community in Leslie County, Kentucky, United States.

He is portrayed by Scottish actor Sylvester McCoy. Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old alien Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey who travels in time and space in the TARDIS, frequently with companions. At the end of life, the Doctor regenerates; as a result, the physical appearance and personality of the Doctor changes. McCoy portrays the Seventh Doctor as a whimsical, thoughtful character who quickly becomes more layered, secretive, and manipulative. His first companion was Melanie Bush (Bonnie Langford), a computer programmer who travelled with his previous incarnation, and who is soon succeeded by troubled teenager and explosives expert Ace (Sophie Aldred), who becomes his prot√©g√©e. The Seventh Doctor first appeared on TV in 1987. After the programme was cancelled at the end of 1989, the Seventh Doctor's adventures continued in novels until the late 1990s. The Seventh Doctor made an appearance at the start of the 1996 movie before the character was replaced by the Eighth Doctor (Paul McGann). Overview In his first season, the Seventh Doctor started out as a comical character, engaging in dundrearyisms (\\"Time and tide melt the snowman,\\" or when partner Mel is kidnapped, \\"A bird in the hand keeps the Doctor away\\"), playing the spoons, and making pratfalls, but later started to develop a darker nature. The Seventh Doctor era is noted for the cancellation of Doctor Who after 26 years. It is also noted for the Virgin New Adventures, a range of original novels published from 1992 to 1997, taking the series beyond the television serials. The Seventh Doctor's final appearance on television was in the 1996 Doctor Who television movie, where he regenerated into the Eighth Doctor, played by Paul McGann. A sketch of him is later seen in John Smith's A Journal of Impossible Things in the new series 2007 episode \\"Human Nature\\". Brief holographic clips of the Seventh Doctor appear in \\"The Next Doctor\\" (2008) and \\"The Eleventh Hour\\" (2010), and as flashbacks in \\"The Name of the Doctor\\" (2013) and as a holographic representation in \\"Twice Upon a Time\\" (2017). The Seventh Doctor also appeared in the 50th anniversary special, \\"The Day of the Doctor\\" (2013) and can be seen standing beside all incarnations of the Doctor, at the time. Biography When the TARDIS was attacked by the Rani, the Sixth Doctor was injured and forced to regenerate. After a brief period of post-regenerative confusion and amnesia (chemically induced by the Rani), the Seventh Doctor thwarted the Rani's plans, and rejoined his companion Mel for whimsical adventures in an odd tower block and a Welsh holiday camp in the 1950s. On the planet Svartos, Mel decided to leave the Doctor's company for that of intergalactic rogue Sabalom Glitz. Also at this time, the Doctor was joined by time-stranded teenager Ace. Although he did not mention it at the time, the Doctor soon recognised that an old enemy from a past adventure, the ancient entity known as Fenric, was responsible for the Time Storm which transported Ace from 1980s Perivale to Svartos in the distant future. Growing more secretive and driven from this point on, the Doctor took Ace under his wing and began teaching her about the universe, all the while keeping an eye out for Fenric's plot. The Doctor began taking a more scheming and proactive approach to defeating evil, using the Gallifreyan stellar manipulator named the Hand of Omega as part of an elaborate trap for the Daleks which resulted in the destruction of their home planet, Skaro. Soon afterwards, the Doctor used a similar tactic and another Time Lord relic to destroy a Cyberman fleet. He engineered the fall of the oppressive government of a future human colony in a single night and encountered the Gods of Ragnarok at a circus on the planet Segonax, whom he had apparently fought throughout time. Later, he was reunited with his old friend, Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart while battling the forces of an alternate dimension on Earth. The Seventh Doctor's manipulations were not reserved for his rivals. With the goal of helping Ace confront her past, he took her to a Victorian house in her home town of Perivale in 1883 which she had burned down in 1983. Eventually, the Doctor confronted and defeated Fenric at a British naval base during World War II, revealing Fenric's part in Ace's history. The Doctor continued to act as Ace's mentor, returning her to Perivale; however, she chose to continue travelling with him. The circumstances of her parting from the Doctor were not shown on television. Near the end of his incarnation, the Seventh Doctor was given the responsibility of transporting the remains of his former enemy the Master from Skaro to Gallifrey. This proved to be a huge mistake; despite having a limited physical form, the Master was able to take control of the Doctor's TARDIS and cause it to land in 1999 San Francisco, where the Doctor was shot in the middle of a gang shoot-out. He was taken to a hospital, where surgeons removed the bullets but mistook the Doctor's double heartbeat for fibrillation; their attempt to save his life instead caused the Doctor to \\"die\\" with one last shocking scream. He is thus the only Doctor to have died at the (unwitting) hand of one of his own companions. Perhaps due to the anaesthesia, the Doctor did not regenerate immediately after death, unlike all previous occasions; he finally did so several hours later, while lying in the hospital's morgue. In Time and the Rani (1987), the Seventh Doctor gives his age soon after his regeneration as \\"exactly\\" 953 years, indicating that some two centuries of subjective time has passed since his fourth incarnation was revealed to be 756 in The Ribos Operation (1978), and approximately half a century since Revelation of the Daleks (1985) in which the Sixth Doctor stated he was 900 years old. The later revival of the series, however, contradicts earlier episodes by establishing the Ninth Doctor as being 900 years old in \\"Aliens of London\\" (2005). Personality The Seventh Doctor has the most profound change in attitude of any of the Doctor's incarnations, beginning as someone bumbling (to the extent of putting himself in danger but not at the cost of his overall great intelligence and benevolent intentions) and progressing into a driven, dark gamemaster whose plans to defeat his adversaries, both old and new, would play out across space and time. He generally displayed an affable, curious, knowledgeable, easygoing, excitable, and charming air. However, as he began to choose his battles and keep a tighter grip on his secrets ‚Äì from his plans to his very identity ‚Äì he also presented more serious, contemplative, secretive, wistful, and manipulative sides with undercurrents of mischief and authority (constantly giving the impression that there was more to him than met the eye). As something of a showman, the Doctor would sometimes act like a buffoon, usually preferring to manipulate events from behind the scenes; much like his second incarnation, he was prepared to play the fool to trick his foes into underestimating him, inevitably leading to their defeat at his hands. He was an adept physical performer and deployed a repertoire of magic tricks, illusions and escape artistry to this effect as part of his plans. Although his more obvious whimsical tendencies disappeared over time (particularly his spoons-playing), he maintained a fondness for idiosyncratic speeches that occasionally referred to literature, ordinary places and even food and drink amidst the weightier concerns on his mind. He was empathetic to his friends (and even his enemies, such as Helen A) and somewhat melancholic at times (such as during Mel's departure and before his decision to eradicate the Daleks) but now placed greater burdens upon himself in the name of protecting the universe. This may have led him to shroud his true intentions in mystery and the use of sleight of hand as befit his fondness for performance, in effect, subverting his more lighthearted qualities to complement and enhance his heroic and darker ones. Given the Seventh Doctor's appearance and stature, he was surprisingly capable of both directly and indirectly taking control of situations involving strangers, using his greater intelligence to assess and direct events. Concerned with the bigger picture, he would sometimes overlook the finer details and his planning (both prepared and improvised) would sometimes have fatal results and consequences. When he acted to end threats, it was usually a ruthless, destructive and final manoeuvre. He was also not above hiding the truth from his friends and allies and using them to complete his schemes and gambits. His tendency to reveal only select information to his companion Ace ‚Äì as well as anyone else around them ‚Äì was used both in her education and in their adventures, as if he were the only one who should know all the answers and others should come to their own conclusions. At two points he even abused Ace's trust in him, once to develop her as a person and again to keep her alive (on both occasions, freeing her from the evil influences that had haunted her during her life), while on one of these adventures, he showed great difficulty in admitting his foreknowledge of the situation's severity to her when she finally confronted him. In spite of his immense fondness for her, and hers for him, he often frustrated her with his secretive nature as his alien behaviour, the great importance of his objectives (especially his focus on obliterating enemies from his past) and his strong desire to both educate and protect her would lead him to keep even her in the dark and would even subordinate her feelings towards him to succeed in their battles. Their close, almost familial bond was likely what helped Ace in moving past the feelings of betrayal she sometimes felt towards the Doctor, particularly as he genuinely had her best interests at heart. In fact, while he appeared to be an unassuming figure, fond of performing magic tricks and displaying notable showmanship, the Seventh Doctor was actually quite powerful and calculating, for he would use his friends and foes alike as pawns in his elaborate chess game against \\"evil\\". As Ace herself put it, he was \\"well devious\\". In direct contrast to his third incarnation, this Doctor was absolutely opposed to violence of any sort (as demonstrated in stories such as Battlefield, where he stops a battle merely by ordering the warriors to desist) and he was totally against the use of firearms (to the extent of 'talking down' a soldier ordered to execute him in The Happiness Patrol by emphasising the easiness of the kill versus the enormity of ending a life), although he also proved capable of rendering a man unconscious with a touch (Battlefield, Survival). In keeping with his established habits, he would use gadgetry of his own invention when the situation called for it, but never as his final gambit. Instead, he almost always managed to talk his enemies into submission, often into suicide ‚Äì perhaps most memorably in Remembrance of the Daleks, where he taunts the seemingly last Dalek in existence until it self-destructs, or in Ghost Light, where he defeats the dangerously unstable Light by ramming home the folly of trying to prevent evolution (he employs variations of this 'talk to death' tactic in Dragonfire, Silver Nemesis and The Curse of Fenric, although primarily to manipulate opponents to guarantee the outcome in his favour). This Doctor also displays strange and 'alien' characteristics playing with the perception of his senses, as he smells an apple and listens to cheese in Survival, and listens to an apple briefly in Delta and the Bannermen. He also displayed a talent for hypnosis on various occasions that appeared to be much stronger than in past incarnations (Battlefield). The Greatest Show in the Galaxy shows him to be a capable entertainer, performing a variety of well known magic tricks. In Ghost Light, he reveals his pet peeves to be burnt toast, bus stations, unrequited love, tyranny, and cruelty. Costume The Doctor's outfit in this incarnation was calmer than his previous attire, but as idiosyncratic as any other. It consisted of an ivory safari jacket with a crimson paisley scarf worn under its lapels and a matching handkerchief in the left pocket, a fob watch chained to the left lapel, a plain white shirt, a scarlet paisley tie, a yellow-brown fair isle-themed pullover adorned with cherry question marks and turquoise zigzag patterns, sand-beige tweed plaid trousers, beige brogued spectator shoes, an ivory colonial-styled Panam cap with a scarlet paisley hatband and an upturned brim and a black umbrella with a cherry question mark- shaped handle. As with the three other Doctors costumed during the John Nathan-Turner era, the above-mentioned question marks on the Doctor's pullover and his umbrella handle continued the cherry-question-marked clothing motif that was introduced in the Fourth Doctor's final season and ended before the Seventh Doctor's regeneration. Although a seemingly casual outfit that reflected the Seventh Doctor's initially easy and whimsical manner, it took on a new light when he became more scheming and prepared in his missions ‚Äì to reflect the emergence of his personality's more mysterious and darker aspects, his jacket, hatband, handkerchief, scarf and tie became more muted and darker in colour, now in shades of burgundy and brown. In the New Adventures novels, images of the Doctor on the covers usually omitted the pullover and eventually depicted him in a cream single breasted suit. On a DVD featurette (\\"Light in Dark Places\\") for Ghost Light, when drawing attention to the stylistic choice of performing in most of the serial without his hat and umbrella, Sylvester McCoy expresses some disdain for the garment, feeling it detracts somewhat from the mood of the story. The changes in colours make the Seventh the only Doctor under Nathan-Turner's tenure to greatly alter his costume; the changes to the outfits worn by his three previous selves during this production period tended to be more subtle and less noteworthy. The Seventh's own attire was repeatedly revised during his first season, initially including a crimson/black tartan scarf and burgundy braces, along with the whangee bamboo- handle umbrella. The Seventh Doctor's TV Movie costume. In the TV Movie the Doctor's costume changed again, with a return to a lighter jacket, now a light brown tweed. Gone were the question mark pullover, scarves, paisley tie and question mark umbrella, replaced by a scarlet brocade waistcoat and a brown/black zig zag pattern tie. However, the Doctor retained his Panama hat. The Doctor enjoyed using his hat, umbrella and the TARDIS key, amongst other items, as physical props, usually as showy affectations or to command attention, while the umbrella could also be used to disarm and trip foes (Paradise Towers, Battlefield, Ghost Light, Survival). Like most of his previous selves, the Seventh carried any number of random items in his pockets, including technological devices and books (Dragonfire, Ghost Light). In a break from his past however, he spoke with a mild Scottish accent with rolled Rs, rather than in his past selves' Received Pronunciation speaking patterns.  Story style  In Season 24, the Seventh Doctor era began with a light-hearted approach, with stories like Delta and the Bannermen clearly aimed at a younger audience. However, in the final two seasons with Andrew Cartmel as script editor, the stories soon explored the true nature of the Doctor, hinting at dark secrets in his past. In Silver Nemesis, Lady Peinforte hints she knows the Doctor's secret of being more than just a Time Lord (deleted scenes in Remembrance of the Daleks and Survival also refer to this). Remembrance has the Doctor use \\"we\\" when referring to early Gallifreyan time travel experiments. Ace also became the focus of a dedicated character arc that was seeded from her introduction onwards and prominently played out during Season 26. With the cancellation of the series, these developments were never fully played out in the television series, but some of them were revealed in the New Adventures. Marc Platt's novel Lungbarrow is usually considered to be the conclusion of the \\"Cartmel Masterplan\\". In that novel, the Doctor is revealed to be the reincarnation of \\"the Other\\", a shadowy figure and contemporary of Rassilon and Omega from Ancient Gallifrey. Lungbarrow was originally intended for Season 26, but producer John Nathan- Turner felt that it revealed too much of the Doctor's origins. It was reworked to become Ghost Light instead. According to McCoy and script editor Andrew Cartmel, a number of Seventh Doctor stories were intended to satirise or protest the rule of then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. McCoy told the Sunday Times in 2010 \\"The idea of bringing politics into Doctor Who was deliberate, but we had to do it very quietly and certainly didn't shout about it...We were a group of politically motivated people and it seemed the right thing to do. At the time Doctor Who used satire to put political messages out there in the way they used to do in places like Czechoslovakia. Our feeling was that Margaret Thatcher was far more terrifying than any monster the Doctor had encountered. Those who wanted to see the messages saw them; others, including one producer, didn't.\\" One story mentioned as having an anti- Thatcher theme was The Happiness Patrol in which the tyrannical Helen A outlawed unhappiness and remarked \\"I like your initiative, your enterprise\\" as her secret police rounded up dissidents. The Doctor persuaded \\"the drones\\", who toiled in the factories and mines, to down tools and rise up in revolt, an echo of the miners' strikes and printers' disputes during Thatcher's first two terms in office.\\"Doctor Who in war with Planet Maggie\\", Sunday Times, 14 February 2010 Script editor Andrew Cartmel assembled several \\"angry young writers\\" such as Ben Aaronovitch and Rona Munro to produce storylines that they hoped would foment anti-Thatcher dissent. Other appearances=Television The Seventh Doctor and Ace appeared twice on television between the time Doctor Who was cancelled and the 1996 television movie. The first was in 1990, in a special episode of the BBC2 educational programme Search Out Science. In this episode, the Doctor acted as a quiz show host, asking questions about astronomy; Ace, K-9 and \\"Cedric, from the planet Glurk\\" were the contestants. The Seventh Doctor then appeared in the 1993 charity special Dimensions in Time. A picture of the Seventh Doctor appears briefly in the Tenth Doctor story \\"Human Nature\\" (2007), in John Smith's A Journal of Impossible Things, and visions of him appear briefly in \\"The Next Doctor\\" (2008), \\"The Eleventh Hour\\" (2010), \\"Nightmare in Silver\\" and \\"The Name of the Doctor\\" (both 2013). He also appears in the 50th anniversary special \\"The Day of the Doctor\\" (2013) helping his past and future incarnations save Gallifrey from the Time War. Audio The Seventh Doctor has featured in dozens of audio dramas. Storylines in these audios include his travels with Ace and nurse Thomas Hector Schofield- known as 'Hex'- who is the son of a young woman that the Doctor failed to save in his sixth incarnation who was particularly close to his then-companion Evelyn Smythe-, his attempts to reform Elizabeth Klein, a Nazi officer from an alternate timeline, and his later interaction with her other self from this reality, and the return of Mel as she travels with him and Ace. Novels Following the end of the TV series, the adventures of Doctor Who were continued in the Virgin New Adventures. The Seventh Doctor was the subject of 60 of these between 1991 and 1997. The Virgin novels pit the Seventh Doctor against the powerful Timewyrm, a complex plan to change history by his old enemy the Monk, facing the renegade time traveler Kadiatu Lethbridge-Stewart, a mysterious psychic brotherhood and their role in Earth's history, and culminates in a return to his family home on Gallifrey that reveals details about how the Doctor left Gallifrey in the first place. These novels also introduce original companions of Professor Bernice Summerfield- who proves so popular that she acquires her own spin-off series-, Roslyn Forrester, and Chris Cwej. His adventures also appeared in the BBC Past Doctor Adventures novels. Some of these are stand-alone stories, but authors Robert Perry and Mike Tucker create a miniseries that explores the Doctor's discovery that Ace is destined to die in her immediate future and the Doctor's attempts to prevent it (as well as a confrontation with his foe the Valeyard), setting up a complex confrontation with the twisted psychopath George Limb as Limb abuses time-travel to avoid his fate of becoming a Cyberman.

The city is located at 42 m above sea level, 7 km to the south of the province's capital (Castell√≥ de la Plana), which it is separate from by the Millars River. it has 51,367 inhabitants (2010 data), most of them living in the urban area that covers about 10.72% of its comarca's 55.4 km2 surface. Ranked by population, it is the second-largest city in the province (after the capital), and fifteenth in the Valencian Community. The city was founded with royal status by King James I of Aragon in 1274 during his campaign to regain Muslim territory in present-day Valencia during the Reconquista. It later became an agricultural centre for orange cultivation, and more recently a centre for the ceramics industry. The city is the birthplace of Francisco de As√≠s T√°rrega y Eixea (21 November 185215 December 1909) who was a Spanish composer and classical guitarist of the Romantic period. He is also the composer of Gran Vals, an excerpt of which was used in a popular Nokia ringtone. In modern times Vila-real is well known for its football club that bears the city's name, a club that in spite of the city's small size has played a semi final in the Champions League and finished among the top teams in Spain on several occasions. Etymology Both the Castilian Spanish Villarreal and Valencian Catalan Vila-real are cognates meaning 'Royal Village', due to the city's foundation by King James I of Aragon. Throughout the Middle Ages, as were most European settlements, it was officially known by its Latinised name Villae Regalis. A 1592 tapestry of the Valencian Parliament shows the city's representative with the old Valencian name Vilareal. It was in the late 18th century, as Spain became more centralised, that the Castilian name took over. The city was renamed in 1939, after the Spanish Civil War, as Villarreal de los Infantes (Royal Town of the Infantes), to avoid confusion with other Spanish localities with the same name. It is sometimes still referred to under this extended version. On 27 February 2006, after a campaign which started in the 1980s, the Valencian form became the only official name for the city, after a unanimous vote by the city council. Inhabitants of the city are known as vila-realencs (male) or vila-realenques (female) in Valencian, and villarrealenses in Spanish.  History  The city's former Valencian name, Vilareal, adorns its representative in a tapestry of the 1592 Valencian Parliament Villarreal was founded on 20 February 1274 by King James I of Aragon (hence its royal status), to strengthen his reconquest of Eastern Spain from the Moors. It was placed strategically on the ancient Via Augusta 65 km north from Valencia, and in the outskirts of the then-Muslim stronghold of Borriana. It was founded with royal status, with representation in the Valencian Parliament and Delegation of the Kingdom, and had the privilege of using the royal standard as its ensign. Villarreal was part of the royal sector of the Valencian Parliament and had an active say in its affairs. The original town was surrounded by walls, but expanded outside these limits beginning in the 14th century due to an increase in population. The demographic and economic imbalances which characterise the 15th century carried on into the beginning of the 16th with constant conflicts between the Christian population and the Mud√©jars (Muslims who still lived in Christian majority Spain) who lived in the area. During the 16th century, productive farm land was extended and enhanced by drilling wells to obtain water and convert dry land into irrigated fields, making it possible to begin commercial agriculture in the 17th century. After the city's disastrous participation in the War of the Spanish Succession, in the second half of the 18th century, the first industries were established, mainly for textiles. Also during that time, the city became involved in various revolts and wars which changed Spain's political make-up. In the 19th century, the cultivation and trade of oranges was introduced, which gave the town great economic progress, led both by businessmen and by farmers' associations or \\"cooperatives\\". After the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), the earnings obtained from the orange trade allowed several entrepreneurs to build ceramic tile factories as a way to diversify their industries. Ceramics has continued to expand up to the present day, and is now Villarreal's main economic activity.  Main sights  The belfry of Sant Jaume Church Sights in the town include: * Bas√≠lica de Sant Pasqual (Saint Paschal's Basilica), from the 20th century (the former building was destroyed during the Spanish Civil War). * Esgl√©sia de Sant Jaume (Saint James's Church), from the 18th century. * Pla√ßa Major (Main Square), a square surrounded by several porticoed houses built in different periods. * The City Museum \\"Casa de Polo\\" * Chapel and park of Mare de D√©u de Gr√†cia (Our Lady of Grace). * Monument of Francisco T√°rrega Monument of Francisco T√°rrega in Villarreal  Economy  Villarreal's economy has evolved since the days of cultivation and trade of oranges in the last century to the manufacturing of ceramic tiles, which today is its most important source of income. It hosts 4 of Spain's 500 largest businesses, all of which trade in the ceramic tile industry. Other industries in the city include financial services, bricks and other clay products, and basic metals. Sport Villarreal CF playing at the Estadio de la Cer√°mica The town is home to Villarreal CF, a football club in La Liga, Spain's highest tier of football. Founded in 1923, the club reached the national divisions in 1956 and the top-tier in 1998. During a successful spell in La Liga, the side were League runners-up in the 2007‚Äì08 season, Champions League semi-finalist in 2006 and Europa League semi-finalist in 2011. The team play at the Estadio de la Cer√°mica which, with a 25,000-seat capacity, could fit half of the population of the town. Villarreal CF full- back Joan Capdevila played in the Spain national squad that won the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa.

Collectively, this body of knowledge is passed down from one generation of urban children to the next, and can also be passed between different groups of children (e.g. in the form of crazes, but also in intergenerational mixing). It is most common in children between the ages of seven and twelve. It is strongest in urban working class industrial districts where children are traditionally free to \\"play out\\" in the streets for long periods without supervision. Difference from mass media culture Children's street culture is invented and largely sustained by children themselves, although it may come to incorporate fragments of media culture and toys in its activities. It is not to be confused with the commercial media-culture produced for children (e.g., comics, television, mass-produced toys, and clothing), although it may overlap. Location and play materials Young children's street culture usually takes place on quiet backstreets and sidewalks, and along routes that venture out into local parks, playgrounds, scrub and wasteland, and to local shops. It can often incorporate many found and scavenged materials such as old car seats, tires, planks, bricks, etc. Sometimes found materials will be combined to create objects (e.g. making guys for Guy Fawkes Night -- see Beck 1984). Play will often incorporate crazes (sometimes incorporating seasonal elements that are freely collected, such as conkers, snowballs, sycamore seeds). It also imposes imaginative status on certain sections of the urban realm (local buildings, street objects, road layouts, etc.). In summer, children may use scavenged materials to create a temporary and semi-hidden \\"den\\" or \\"hideout\\" or \\"HQ\\" in a marginal area near their homes, which serves as an informal meeting and relaxation place during the summer (see: Sobel, 2001). An urban area that looks faceless or neglected to an adult may have deep \\"spirit of place\\" meanings in children's street culture. History and research Although it varies from place to place, research shows that it appears to share many commonalities across many cultures. It is a traditional phenomenon that has been closely investigated and documented in the western world during the 20th century by anthropologists and folklorists such as Iona Opie; street photographers such as Roger Mayne, Helen Levitt, David Trainer, Humphrey Spender and Robert Doisneau; urbanists such as Colin Ward and Robin Moore, as well as being described in countless novels of childhood. The research of Robin Moore stresses children's need for 'marginal' unsupervised areas 'within running distance' of homes (scrubby bushes and hedges, disused buildings). There are now two academic journals devoted to this area, the Journal of Children's Geographies and Play & Folklore. It has occasionally been central to feature films, such as the Our Gang (\\"Little Rascals\\") series, Ealing's Hue and Cry (1947) and some Children's Film Foundation films such as Go Kart, Go! and Soap Box Derby. Mass motorisation Between 1922 and 1933 over 12,000 children in England and Wales were killed in accidents involving motor vehicles. In 1900, some 10,000 automobiles were produced, in 2015 some 100 million automobiles were produced, the rise negatively affecting children's street culture. Since the advent of distractions such as video games, and television, concerns have been expressed about the vitality - or even the survival - of children's street culture. Children's urban legends Many informal groups of small children will develop some level of superstitious beliefs about their local area. For instance, they may believe that there are certain places that are \\"unlucky\\" to step on (e.g.: certain large cracks in a sidewalk) or touch (e.g.: gateposts of a certain color) or pass beyond (such as the end of the sidewalk, beyond which is another dimension inhabited by the bogeyman), or that an old woman is a \\"witch\\", or that an abandoned house is \\"haunted\\". But in some extreme circumstances, a consistent myth may emerge among young children, and across a large area. One example dates from 1997; the Miami New Times published Lynda Edwards' report \\"Myths Over Miami\\", which describes a huge consistent mythology spreading among young homeless children in the American South. The story has been picked up and reprinted many times on internet blogs and websites.Allie Conti, How a 1997 New Times Feature on Homeless Kids' Folklore Exploded the Internet. New Times, September 5, 2013. There is no known verification or confirmation that the mythology she describes actually exists,Ian Simmons, Twenty Years of Myths Over Miami. Fortean Times, Christmas 2017. but these \\"secret stories\\" are clearly based on known elements of street culture, such as labeling certain places \\"haunted\\" or recycling legends of dangerous spirits such as Bloody Mary. The article was the basis for Mercedes Lackey's novel Mad Maudlin, co-written with Rosemary Edghill.

Bricklin (born March 9, 1939) is an American businessman, widely known for an unorthodox career spanning more than six decades with numerous prominent failures and successes -- primarily manufacturing or importing automobiles to the United States, ultimately starting over thirty companies. After franchising his father's hardware stores at age 19, Bricklin founded Subaru of America, Inc. in 1968, founded General Vehicles to manufacture the Bricklin SV-1 (1974-76), imported and marketed Fiat X1/9 and Fiat 124 Sport Spider (1982), imported and marketed under the name Yugo the Zastava Koral hatchback from the then-Yugoslavia (1985‚àí92), manufactured and marketed an electric bicycle as the EV Warrior (1982), and contracted to import and distribute vehicles made by the Chinese company Chery (2004). In 2017, at age 78, he promoted a plan to transform high-end car dealers into high-end art dealers, after becoming interested in the business aspect of art. In 2005, the New York Times said Bricklin is \\"often likened to an automotive version of P.T. Barnum.\\" In 2009, noted documentarian Morgan Spurlock said Bricklin \\"goes nonstop. He‚Äôs testosterone unleashed, a brilliant negotiator and an incredible character.\\" In 2013, Rolling Stone described him as \\"brash, bombastic, and pathologically prone to betting the farm on pie-in-the-sky automotive endeavors.\\" In 2017, Autoweek said Bricklin has \\"a mind that works like a machine gun.\\" Keith Crain, publisher of Automotive News said Bricklin is \\"like one of those toy clowns that when you punch it, it bounces right back up.\\" Background Born in Philadelphia to Jewish parents, Albert and Gertrude Bricklin, young Malcolm had one of his first jobs stretching hides in his family's furrier shop. As a young child, he moved to Orlando, Florida with his family -- where he grew up and graduated from William R. Boone High School in 1956, later dropping out of the University of Florida (1958). Bricklin said that as a child, he never liked to eat; \\"stopping to eat meant I had to stop playing.\\" At the height of his success, he owned a desert ranch in Scottsdale, Ariz., and a 5,000-acre home in the Colorado Rockies with an indoor shooting range, a riverfront swimming pool, helipad, and pet camel. Bricklin has six sons, three with his first wife. As of 2017, he has been divorced three times, amicably, and lives in Monroe, New York with his fourth wife, artist Sania Teymeny. One of his boys, ping-pong buff Jonathan, is author of the book Flicking Boogers in the Wind and starred in the 2015 television series Connected with his then-girlfriend, Susan Sarandon. Career=Handyman America Bricklin built his father's Orlando, Florida, building supply business into a franchised chain at age 19. Named Handyman America and open seven days a week, Bricklin left behind his interest in 1960 after dozens of lawsuits and judgments stemming from the chain, -- shortly before the chain's bankruptcy. Subaru In the mid-1960s, after he sold his interest in Handyman, Bricklin moved back to Philadelphia. When he was exploring establishing a network of gas stations that would rent scooters, he went to Japan to meet with the manufacturer of the Rabbit scooter, Fuji Heavy Industries, to arrange for the purchase and importation of their scooters -- at a time when Fuji was just getting out of manufacturing scooters and was concentrating on their automotive business. At the meeting, Bricklin saw Fuji‚Äôs Subaru 360 mini-car, which got up to 60 miles to a gallon of gas and did not require federalizing in the United States because it weighed under 1,000 pounds.http://www.hemmings.com/hsx/stories/2009/05/01/hmn_feature14.html He was able to secure an exclusive contract with Fuji Heavy Industries to import Subaru cars and trucks into the United States, forming Subaru of America. Despite the car's ill fit for American roads and traffic, Bricklin was described as \\"one of the first auto industry mavericks to recognize that thrifty, inexpensive Japanese cars could be big in the United States.\\"Orlando Sentinel http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1996-06-16/features/9606071016_1_bricklin- sv-1-malcolm-bricklin-subaru-of-america The first Subarus to enter the US were the 1968-1969 Subaru 360 and the 1970 Subaru FF-1 Star. Less than six months after the company formed, it became a public company and has been from 1968. Subaru of America became the only import car company that was publicly traded, making small fortunes for Bricklin and COO Harvey Lamm.http://fortune.com/2012/11/19/are-subarus-the-best-cars-money-can-buy/ FasTrack In 1971, Bricklin created a franchise named FasTrack, combining RV sales with shopping center parking lot race courses, where the public could drive one of 900 unsold Subaru 360s, modified by Bruce Myers. The venture ultimately failed. Bricklin SV-1 Bricklin subsequently founded his own car company, General Vehicle, manufacturing the Bricklin SV-1 two-seat gull- wing door sports car -- informally called the Bricklin. \\"SV\\" stood for \\"safety vehicle,\\" and Bricklin applied standards ahead of those the US government was requiring in the 1970s, including exceeding US crash protection standards. The SV-1 protected occupants with a tubular steel perimeter frame, roll cage and a chassis capable of withstanding a high velocity impact without deformation. The car didn't include a cigarette lighter or ashtray, as Bricklin viewed smoking while driving as unsafe. The Bricklin featured a vacuum forming process with color-impregnated acrylic bonded to fiberglass body panels. The car garnered mostly positive coverage from consumer media. In Car & Driver's comparison test, a '75 Bricklin with the Ford engine proved to be nearly a match for a '75 Corvette in every performance category‚Äîand the Bricklin's power-operated gullwing doors maxed out the \\"coefficient of cool\\" metric. Car and Driver concluded that despite some build quality and ergonomic deficiencies, and a price disadvantage, the Bricklin was \\"a tangible threat to the Corvette.\\" Intended for the US market, the Bricklin SV1s were manufactured in Canada in the province of New Brunswick which sought to address its unemployment, nearing 25% in the mid-‚Äô70s. New Brunswick Premier Richard Hatfield supported the Province‚Äôs involvement in the Bricklin venture as a way of establishing a manufacturing base that could provide steady, high paying jobs and attract interest in the Province through the publicity the car provided. Cars of Futures Past- Bricklin SV1 Kurt Ernst December 26, 2014 http://blog.hemmings.com/index.php/2013/12/26/cars-of-futures-past-bricklin- sv1/ Production began in mid 1974 and continued through late 1975, employing over 1200 people in the Saint John and Minto, New Brunswick plants. In September 1975, after building 2,854 cars, and General Vehicles having set up over 400 US automobile dealers with 40,000 back orders, the Province refused to provide further financial assistance and forced the company into receivership. International Automobile Importers (IAI) After Fiat left the U.S. market, Bricklin created International Automobile Importers (IAI) in 1982 to import the Fiat X1/9 and 2000 roadster, renaming them the Bertone and the Pininfarina Azzura. The company was profitable, but when Cadillac subsequently made a joint venture with Pininfarina, IAI was told that Cadillac didn't want a $14,000 Pininfarina being sold next to its $55,000 Pininfarina- manufactured Allant√© -- and gave IAI six months before they cancelled production of the cars.Car and Driver July 2009 Steven Cole Smith http://www.caranddriver.com/features/malcolm-bricklin-what-id-do-differently- feature  Yugo, Global Motors  Seeking to import a simple, low cost car to the U.S. market, Bricklin was introduced to Zastava Automobiles, manufactured in Kragujevac Yugoslavia ‚Äì now Serbia. Zastava had produced cars since 1953 under a license from the Italian company Fiat. In 1984, the entire Yugoslav car industry produced 236,000 cars, 58,000 of which were exported. http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-11-28/business/8503220481_1_zavodi- crvena-zastava-yugo-gv-italian-fiat Bricklin, senior advisor Henry Kissinger, former U.S. Under-Secretary of State and Yugo board member Lawrence Eagleburger, and Global Motors executives met with Zastava. Bricklin agreed to import the Zastava Koral, marketing it as the Yugo. Bricklin and his engineers suggested some 600 changes for the U.S. market, including a 1.1-liter 4-cylinder engine, improvements in the anti-pollution system, comfort adjustments, safety devices, and special carburetors for lead-free gasoline. In addition to the main Kragujevac complex, about 200 smaller Yugoslav factories manufactured parts for the cars.Zastava Koral Bricklin had his own people at the plant to monitor the effort, stressing high quality. A team of British quality experts sent a cadre to Kragujevac to study the factory and recommend improvements. The first shipment of the Yugos arrived via ship from Bar, Montenegro in Baltimore, Maryland in July 1985. The Yugo was the fastest- selling car ever in the US from Europe, 163,000 in three years, and was the least expensive new car sold in the United States. At first, five models of Yugo were marketed in the United States for model year 1987: the basic entry- level $3,990-($9,363.69 in 2020) GV (for \\"Great Value\\"), the GVC with a glass sunroof, the nearly identical GVL and GVS with minor trim and upholstery upgrades, and the sportier GVX with the 1300 cc engine, five-speed manual transmission and standard equipment including a plush interior, ground-effects package, alloy wheels, rally lights, and a centre high mount stop lamp. The Cabrio convertible was introduced in 1988. Bricklin sold his interest in Yugo in 1988 for $20 million. On May 30, 1992 United Nations sanctions were imposed, severing Yugoslavia from world trade. The effects of the United Nations sanctions on Yugoslavia forced Zastava to withdraw the car from every export market. After embargoes stifled production, NATO bombed the company's automotive facilities in 1999, instead of its munitions division. The Yugo was subject to derision by critics who pointed to its use of older Fiat technology. It was voted Car Talk's worst car of the millennium. Defenders argued that Yugo's reputation suffered when owners failed to perform basic maintenance. Popular Mechanics magazine surveyed 1,000 Yugo buyers and published the report in June 1987. 78% described workmanship as good to excellent, 25% giving an unqualified excellent, 5% said poor. 42.4% said they would buy a Yugo again and 36% said maybe they would buy again. Electric vehicles In the 1990s, Bricklin turned his attention to producing environmentally friendly vehicles. He studied battery technology and formed an electric vehicle company. Bricklin electric vehicles were the wave of the future, a notion that appeared to be ahead of its time. After trying to get electric cars off the ground for a time, Bricklin formed a partnership with Dr. Malcolm Currie. Currie is the former Chairman and CEO of Hughes Aircraft, GM Delco and former Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering. In Bricklin‚Äôs and Currie‚Äôs view, an electric bike was a promising first step to winning people over to the idea of electric cars. California had just enacted the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) regulation in 1990 which mandated 3% of a vehicle manufacturer's products would have to be zero emission (electric) by the year 2000. An electric bike that could be sold through dealerships seemed like a perfect way to address the requirements of that mandate. Bricklin and Currie formed the Electric Bicycle Company, and produced the first EV Warriors by late 1993. The electric bike was initially built using a custom aluminum mountain bike frame from Zimmark Corporation in Malaysia. Later versions used a Giant frame produced in Taiwan. All versions used a 6-speed Shimano rear derailleur with GripShift handlebar controller. The rider could pedal unaided by the motors, or could activate them with a thumb switch on the handle bar. That smoothly, quietly and quickly took the bike to 15-20 MPH depending on the size of the rider with a range of about 17 miles before it needed a charge. The EV Warrior came in seven colors, resembling a mountain bike with a large box behind the seat that straddled the rear wheel. Inside the box were two 24-volt electric motors powered by two rechargeable sealed 12-volt lead-acid batteries. The bike used advanced technology for the time, with halogen headlights, LED taillights and brake lights, and offered options such as a wireless security remote fob, LED turn signals in the mirrors, and a front disc brake. The suggested retail price was $1,400 to $1,900, depending on options.https://articles.latimes.com/1996-07-12/business/fi-23293_1_electric- bicycle http://wardsauto.com/news-amp-analysis/bricklin-returns-us-electric- bicycle This was roughly one-third the price of an inexpensive new car, and even a youth-oriented marketing campaign that included a super hero comic book (The EV Warriors) failed to generate enough interest. The company filed for bankruptcy in 1996. When the company folded, Electric Bicycle company was purchased by Lee Iacocca who renamed the company EV Global. That company no longer exists. Currie later founded Currie Cruisers and co-founded Real Spirit USA, to further develop the electric bicycles. Chery Beginning in 2002, Bricklin embarked on a three-year journey around the world to find a manufacturing partner to help him create a value brand in the US, examining the United Kingdom, India, Poland and after seeing their factory and meeting the executive staff, he decided to enter into an Importation Agreement with Chery Automobile Company, which is located in the Anhui Province of ChinaAnhui and owned by the Provincial Anhui Government. Visionary Vehicles (now named VCars, LLC) entered into a joint venture in December 2004 to import 5 different models of cars into North America.https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/09/26/car-town Bricklin staffed an Engineering office in Detroit to direct the changes required to meet and exceed safety the homologation requirements in the United States. He established a dealer network in the United States and Canada. Bricklin hired consultants, advisors and employees with financial and automotive experience, including Allen and company;Allen & Company Atlantic Pacific Capital;Atlantic- Pacific Capital Ambassador van den Heuvel, former US Ambassador to the United Nations;William vanden Heuvel Maurice Strong, former United Nations undersecretary; Ron Harbour, of Harbour Consultants, international automobile factory evaluators; Marianne McInerney, former President of the International Automotive Dealers Association;https://www.linkedin.com/pub/marianne- mcinerney/4/b3b/3b4 and Per Arnberg, President of Fram Shipowning, LTD, an international shipping company. Working with Atlantic Pacific Capital, he brought in George Soros, who put $200,000,000 in escrow to help bring Chery to the U.S.http://autoweek.com/article/car-news/bricklin-gets-bankroll-visionary- vehicles-founder-gets-200-million-help-bring-chery - sthash.pNlh0JhD.dpufhttp://tapscottscopydesk.blogspot.com/2006/06/soros- investing-200-million-in-chinese.html; He also retained New York Marketing and Public Relations firms that generated worldwide exposure for Chery. After spending two years and $26 million to bring Chery‚Äôs manufacturing capabilities up to international standards and to create awareness of Chery, Visionary Vehicles discovered that Chery was using Visionary Vehicle‚Äôs engineering staff to work on a project that involved Chrysler Corporation [which ultimately failed to materialize]. Shortly thereafter, Chery entered into an agreement with Quantum LLC, a subsidiary company of the Israel Corporation, brought in to help fund Visionary Vehicle‚Äôs participation in the joint venture with Chery. The agreement between Chery and Israel Corporation was done without Visionary Vehicle‚Äôs knowledge or approval, and excluded Visionary Vehicles. Bricklin told Reuters, \\"We found out what was really going on behind our back at the end of '06 and we have been trying to get justice ever since. Dennis Gore, former Visionary Cars executive, used proprietary information to help Chery launch a joint venture with Quantum LLC. Visionary Vehicles subsequently filed suits to recoup losses and collect damages from the failed deal. The lawsuit against Chery AutomobileV Cars LLC v. Chery Automobile Co et al., U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division, No. 08-cv-13113 was arbitrated in Hong Kong and Visionary Vehicles received an award, subject to a confidentiality provision. Having discovered Dennis Gore‚Äôs role in undermining the joint venture with Chery, Visionary Vehicles also sued Gore in Federal Court, in Detroit, Michigan.V Cars, LLC v. KCA Engineering, LLC, United States District Court for The Eastern District of Michigan, Case No. 2:11-cv-12805. A Federal jury returned a verdict in favor of V Cars, LLC, finding that KCA Engineering LLC, controlled by Dennis Gore, committed fraud and other offenses and awarded $2 million in damages to Visionary Vehicles.https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/15/us-autos-detroit-bricklin- idUSBRE96E0SV20130715.

Tasque√±a connects Line 2 with the Xochimilco Light Rail line, which runs from this station to the borough of Xochimilco. It also connects with two trolleybus lines: route A, running between Tasque√±a and Metro Autobuses del Norte, north of the city, and route K, running between Ciudad Universitaria (UNAM's main campus) and the San Lorenzo Teconzo campus of the Universidad Aut√≥noma de la Ciudad de M√©xico (UACM). Tren Ligero at Tasque√±a, 2008 Metro Tasque√±a also serves Mexico City's southern bus depot, which serves important cities like Cuernavaca, Acapulco, Taxco, and the rest of southern Mexico. The station has four hexagonal murals from Alberto Castro Le√±ero: \\"Fuego\\", \\"Aliento\\", \\"Azul\\" y \\"Horizontal\\". Each mural is 11 meters high and 3 meters wide. The murals are made of pieces of talavera and polychromatic ceramic.https://web.archive.org/web/20150403043953/http://www.metro.df.gob.mx/cultura2/murelementos.html The terminal currently causes major traffic problems in the neighborhood, mainly by public buses and taxi cabs trying to cruise and flow into the terminals to pick up passengers both from the subway and the regional bus lines. It has become a major gathering center for informal merchants, selling of illegally reproduced media, prostitution and environment pollution. Nearby *Terminal Central de Autobuses del Sur, bus depot.

The district, numbered as the 7th District from 2005 to 2013, is located in the southwestern portion of the state and includes Lafayette and Lake Charles. He is a member of the Republican Party. Boustany stepped down from the U.S. House in January 2017; he was a candidate for the United States Senate in 2016 in a bid to succeed the retiring Republican David Vitter. Boustany did not advance beyond the primary election, finishing third in the jungle primary behind Republican John Neely Kennedy and Democrat Foster Campbell. He was succeeded in the House of Representatives by Clay Higgins, a Republican who is a Lafayette law enforcement officer residing outside the district in St. Landry Parish. Early life, education, and medical career Boustany was born in Lafayette, Louisiana, the son of Madlyn M. (n√©e Ackal) and Charles W. Boustany, Sr. (1930‚Äì2009); his paternal grandparents, Alfred Frem Boustany and Florida (n√©e Saloom), were immigrants from Lebanon. His maternal grandparents were also Lebanese. In 2006, he was one of four Arab-American members of Congress. The senior Boustany, a Democrat, served for sixteen years as coroner of Lafayette Parish. Congressman Boustany has nine siblings: James, Jon, Ron, Stella (Dr. Stella B. Noel), Therese (Mrs. Reggie), Kathryn (Mrs. Scurlock), Madlyn (Mrs. Juneau), Adele (Mrs. Weber), and Cheryn (Mrs. Eppley). He is a cousin of Victoria Reggie Kennedy, widow of U.S. Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts. Boustany attended the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, at which he was a member of Kappa Alpha Order fraternity. He earned his medical degree from Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center New Orleans in 1978. He is a retired cardiovascular surgeon who completed his residency in Rochester, New York before returning to Louisiana to take a job at Charity Hospital, New Orleans. U.S. House of Representatives=Elections ;2004 In 2004, incumbent Democratic U.S. Congressman Chris John of Louisiana's 7th congressional district decided to retire in order to run for the U.S. Senate. John had held the district for eight years without serious difficulty, even though it had been trending increasingly Republican at the national level. Boustany jumped into the race with another Republican, the late David Thibodaux of Lafayette, Democratic state senator Willie Mount of Lake Charles and Democratic state representative Don Cravins Jr. of Opelousas. In the open primary election, Boustany ranked first with 39 percent, with Mount garnering 25 percent for second place. Under Louisiana's nonpartisan blanket primary system, in the event no candidate wins a \\"50 percent plus one vote\\" total, a runoff is conducted between the two top candidates, regardless of party. Vice President Dick Cheney campaigned on behalf of Boustany. In the December 4 run- off election, Boustany defeated Mount 55‚Äì45 percent. He was only the second Republican to represent the district, the first having been Jimmy Hayes, who switched from Democratic affiliation in 1995. ;2006 Boustany won re-election to a second term with 71 percent of the vote, defeating Democrat Mike Stagg.\\"Boustany secured a second term with 71 percent of vote\\" , The Daily Advertiser; accessed November 15, 2016. ;2008 Boustany won re-election to a third term defeating Cravins, now a state senator, 62‚Äì34 percent. ;2010 Boustany won re-election to a fourth term unopposed.Unopposed Candidates in Acadiana , KATC.com; accessed November 15, 2016. ;2012 After Louisiana lost a district in redistricting, most of Boustany's territory became the 3rd District. He faced freshman fellow Republican and 3rd District incumbent Jeff Landry of New Iberia. Although the district was numerically Landry's district, it was geographically and demographically more Boustany's district. Indeed, the new 3rd contained almost two-thirds of Boustany's former territory, while Landry retained only the western third of his former district. Landry led Boustany in third-quarter 2011 fundraising, $251,000 to $218,000. According to Federal Election Commission, Boustany led in cash-on-hand lead, $1.1 million ‚Äì $402,000. In addition to Boustany and Landry, a third Republican, state Representative Chris Leopold of Plaquemines Parish, announced via Facebook his candidacy for the seat, but he never filed the paperwork. The Boustany-Landry race attracted most of the political attention in Louisiana in 2012, as it was seen as pitting an establishment Republican against a candidate identifying with the Tea Party. Though most politicians shunned involvement in the heated race, Louisiana Commissioner of Agriculture and Forestry Michael G. Strain endorsed Boustany, whom he described as particularly helpful to the agricultural sector while serving as a U.S. representative. Landry, meanwhile, carried the backing of most of the Republican parish executive committees in the district. Landry also was endorsed by Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum political action committee. In the November 6 election, technically a nonpartisan blanket primary for Congress, Boustany led Landry by 45,596 votes. In a five-candidate field, Boustany received 139,123 votes (45 percent); Landry received 93,527 votes (30 percent). Democrat Ron Richard procured the critical 67,070 votes (22 percent). The remaining 7,908 votes (2 percent) and 3,765 ballots (1 percent) were cast, respectively, for Republican Bryan Barrilleaux and the Libertarian Jim Stark. Because no candidate received a majority, Boustany and Landry met in a runoff contest held on December 8. Boustany won the runoff election against Landry with 58,820 votes (61 percent). He had large margins in seven of the ten parishes in the district, particularly in Acadia, Calcasieu, and Lafayette but lost the three parishes that Landry represents, St. Martin, Iberia, and St. Mary. Tenure Boustany presented the Republican response to President Barack H. Obama's joint address to Congress on Wednesday September 9, 2009. He was the sponsor of H.R. 1173, the Fiscal Responsibility and Retirement Security Act of 2011. The bill would repeal title VIII of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act which established a voluntary long-term care insurance program. It passed the house 267‚Äì159 on February 1, 2012 but was never passed by the Senate. In 2013, Boustany was a sponsor of the United States farm bill, which was rejected 234‚Äì195 in votes, with sixty-two Republicans voting against. Committee assignments * Committee on Ways and Means ** Subcommittee on Oversight (Chairman) ** Subcommittee on Human Resources ** Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures 2016 U.S. Senate campaign Boustany ran for the open U.S. Senate seat held by retiring Republican David Vitter, and on election day he received 15.4 percent of the vote at third place, not enough to advance to the run-off. Personal life Boustany's wife Bridget Edwards is a daughter of the late Acadia Parish assistant district attorney Nolan Edwards (1930‚Äì1983) of Crowley and Eleanor Merrill of Longboat Key, Florida. Nolan Edwards was shot to death in his law office by a disgruntled client. Bridget Boustany is hence a paternal niece of Democratic former Governor Edwin Washington Edwards.Jim Brown, \\"Internal Republican Battles Affect La.

Classically, this occurs as a postoperative complication of tooth extraction. Alveolar osteitis usually occurs where the blood clot fails to form or is lost from the socket (i.e., the defect left in the gum when a tooth is taken out). This leaves an empty socket where bone is exposed to the oral cavity, causing a localized alveolar osteitis limited to the lamina dura (i.e., the bone which lines the socket). This specific type is known as dry socket and is associated with increased pain and delayed healing time. Dry socket occurs in about 0.5‚Äì5% of routine dental extractions, and in about 25‚Äì30% of extractions of impacted mandibular third molars (wisdom teeth which are buried in the bone of the lower jaw and which erupt during adulthood). If it is going to occur, the pain of dry socket may appear as early as three days following surgery; however, a patient who has gone a full week without experiencing this kind of pain is highly unlikely to develop it. Signs and symptoms The most common location of dry socket: in the socket of an extracted mandibular third molar (wisdom tooth). Since alveolar osteitis is not primarily an infection, there is not usually any pyrexia (fever) or cervical lymphadenitis (swollen glands in the neck), and only minimal edema (swelling) and erythema (redness) is present in the soft tissues surrounding the socket. Signs may include: * An empty socket, which is partially or totally devoid of blood clot. Exposed bone may be visible or the socket may be filled with food debris which reveals the exposed bone once it is removed. The exposed bone is extremely painful and sensitive to touch. Surrounding inflamed soft tissues may overlie the socket and hide the dry socket from casual examination. * Denuded (bare) bone walls. Symptoms may include: * Dull, aching, throbbing pain in the area of the socket, which is moderate to severe and may radiate to other parts of the head such as the ear, eye, temple and neck. The pain normally starts on the second to fourth day after the extraction, and may last 10‚Äì40 days. The pain may be so strong that even strong analgesics do not relieve it. * Intraoral halitosis (oral malodor). * Bad taste in the mouth. Causes The cause(s) of dry socket are not completely understood. Normally, following extraction of a tooth, blood is extravasated into the socket, and a blood clot (thrombus) forms. This blood clot is replaced with granulation tissue which consists of proliferating fibroblasts and endothelial cells derived from remnants of the periodontal membrane, surrounding alveolar bone and gingival mucosa. In time this in turn is replaced by coarse, fibrillar bone and finally by mature, woven bone. The clot may fail to form because of poor blood supply (e.g., secondary to local factors such as smoking, anatomical site, bone density and conditions which cause sclerotic bone to form). The clot may be lost because of excessive mouth rinsing, or disintegrate prematurely due to fibrinolysis. Fibrinolysis is the degeneration of the clot and may be caused by the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin and formation of kinins. Factors which promote fibrinolysis include local trauma, estrogens, and pyrogens from bacteria. Bacteria may secondarily colonize the socket, and lead to further dissolution of the clot. Bacterial breakdown and fibrinolysis are widely accepted as a major contributing factors to the loss of the clot. Bone tissue is exposed to the oral environment, and a localized inflammatory reaction takes place in the adjacent marrow spaces. This localizes the inflammation to the walls of the socket, which become necrotic. The necrotic bone in the socket walls is slowly separated by osteoclasts and fragmentary sequestra may form. The bones of the jaws seem to have some evolutionary resistance to this process. When bone is exposed at other sites in the human body, this is a much more serious condition. In a dry socket, healing is delayed because tissue must grow from the surrounding gingival mucosa, which takes longer than the normal organisation of a blood clot. Some patients may develop short term halitosis, which is the result of food debris stagnating in the socket and the subsequent action of halitogenic bacteria. The main factors involved in the development of dry socket are discussed below. Extraction site Dry sockets more commonly occur in the mandible than the maxilla, due to the relatively poor blood supply of the mandible and also because food debris tends to gather in lower sockets more readily than upper ones. It more commonly occurs in posterior sockets (molar teeth) than anterior sockets (premolars and incisors), possibly because the size of the created surgical defect is relatively larger, and because the blood supply is relatively poorer at these sites. Dry socket is especially associated with extraction of lower wisdom teeth. Inadequate irrigation (washing) of the socket has been associated with increased likelihood of dry socket. Infection Dry socket is more likely to occur where there is a pre-existing infection in the mouth, such as necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis or chronic periodontitis. Wisdom teeth not associated with pericoronitis are less likely to cause a dry socket when extracted. The oral microbiota has been demonstrated to have fibrinolytic action in some individuals, and these persons may be predisposed to developing dry sockets after tooth extraction. Infection of the socket following tooth extraction is different from dry socket, although in dry socket secondary infection may occur in addition. Smoking Smoking and tobacco use of any kind are associated with increased risk of dry socket. This may be partially due to the vasoconstrictive action of nicotine on small blood vessels. Abstaining from smoking in the days immediately following a dental extraction reduces the risk of a dry socket occurring. Surgical trauma Dry socket is more likely to occur following a difficult tooth extraction. It is thought that excessive force applied to the tooth, or excessive movement of the tooth burnishes the bony walls of the socket and crushes blood vessels, impairing the repair process. It has also been shown that dry socket is more likely to occur when an inexperienced surgeon performed the extraction, possibly because excessive force or excessive tooth movements are used. Vasoconstrictors Vasoconstrictors are present in most local anesthetics, and are intended to increase the length of analgesia by reducing blood supply to the region which reduces the amount of local anesthetic solution that is absorbed into the circulation and carried from the local tissues. Hence, use of local anesthetics with vasoconstrictors is associated with an increased risk of dry socket occurring. However, on occasion, use of local anesthetic without vasoconstrictors would not provide sufficient analgesia, especially in the presence of acute pain and infection on maxillary teeth, meaning that the total dose of local anesthetic may need to be increased. Adequate pain control during the extraction is balanced against an increased risk of dry socket. However, the use of 3% Mepivacaine in inferior alveolar nerve blocks has been found to have a similar anesthetic effect to that of lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine, save for a slightly shorter duration of action, and, as such, this may be advantageous in certain situations. Radiotherapy Radiotherapy directed at the bones of the jaws causes several changes to the tissue, resulting in decreased blood supply.  Menstrual cycle  The menstrual cycle could be a determinant risk factor in the frequency of Alveolar Osteitis. Studies have shown that because of hormonal changes, women in the middle of menstrual cycle and the ones taking oral contraceptives (birth control pills) have a higher tendency of having Alveolar Osteitis after their tooth extraction surgery. It is recommended that elective surgeries be performed during the menstrual period in both oral contraceptives users and non users to eliminate the effect of cycle-related hormonal changes on the development of Alveolar Osteitis. Diagnosis Dry socket typically causes pain on the second to fourth day following a dental extraction. Other causes of post extraction pain usually occur immediately after the anesthesia/analgesia has worn off, (e.g., normal pain from surgical trauma or mandibular fracture) or has a more delayed onset (e.g., osteomyelitis, which typically causes pain several weeks following an extraction). Examination typically involves gentle irrigation with warm saline and probing of the socket to establish the diagnosis. Sometimes part of the root of the tooth or a piece of bone fractures off and is retained in the socket. This can be another cause of pain in a socket, and causes delayed healing. A dental radiograph (x-ray) may be indicated to demonstrate such a suspected fragment. Prevention Some evidence suggests that rinsing with chlorhexidine (0.12% or 0.2%) or placing chlorhexidine gel (0.2%) in the sockets of extracted teeth reduces the frequency of dry socket. Another review concluded that preventative antibiotics reduce the risk of dry socket (and infection and pain) following third molar extractions of wisdom teeth, however their use is associated with an increase in mild and transient adverse effects. The authors questioned whether treating 12 people with antibiotics to prevent one infection would do more harm overall than good, in view of the potential side effects and also of antibiotic resistance. Nevertheless, there is evidence that individuals who are at clear risk may benefit from antibiotics. There is also evidence that antifibrinolytic agents applied to the socket after the extraction may reduce the risk of dry socket. Some dentists and oral surgeons routinely debride the bony walls of the socket to encourage hemorrhage (bleeding) in the belief that this reduces the incidence of dry socket, but there is no evidence to support this practice. It has been suggested that dental extractions in females taking oral contraceptives be scheduled on days without estrogen supplementation (typically days 23‚Äì28 of the menstrual cycle). It has also been suggested that teeth to be extracted be scaled prior to the procedure. Prevention of alveolar osteitis can be exacted by following post-operative instructions, including: # Taking any recommended medications # Avoiding intake of hot fluids for one to two days. Hot fluids raise the local blood flow and thus interfere with organization of the clot. Therefore, cold fluids and foods are encouraged, which facilitate clot formation and prevent its disintegration. # Avoiding smoking. It reduces the blood supply, leading to tissue ischemia, reduced tissue perfusion and eventually higher incidence of painful socket. # Avoiding drinking through a straw or spitting forcefully as this creates a negative pressure within the oral cavity leading to an increased chance of blood clot instability. Treatment Treatment is usually symptomatic, (i.e., pain medications) and also the removal of debris from the socket by irrigation with saline or local anesthetic. Medicated dressings are also commonly placed in the socket; although these will act as a foreign body and prolong healing, they are usually needed due to the pain. The dressings are usually stopped once the pain is lessened. Examples of medicated dressings include antibacterials, topical anesthetics and obtundants, or combinations of all three, e.g., zinc oxide and eugenol impregnated cotton pellets, alvogyl (eugenol, iodoform and butamen), dentalone, bismuth subnitrate and iodoform paste (BIPP) on ribbon gauze and metronidazole and lidocaine ointment. A 2012 review of treatments for dry socket concluded that there was not enough evidence to determine the effectiveness of any treatments. People who develop a dry socket typically seek healthcare advice several times after the dental extraction, where the old dressing is removed, the socket irrigated and a new dressing placed. Curettage of the socket increases the pain and whether it is of overall benefit is debated.> Prognosis If a dry socket occurs, the total healing time is increased. Postoperative pain is also worse than the normal discomfort which accompanies healing following any minor surgical procedure. The pain may last for seven to forty days. Epidemiology Overall, the rate of dry socket is about 0.5‚Äì5% for routine dental extractions, and about 25‚Äì30% for impacted mandibular third molars (wisdom teeth which are buried in the bone). Females are more frequently affected than males, but this appears to be related to oral contraceptive use rather than any underlying gender predilection. The majority of dry sockets occur in individuals aged between 20 and 40 which is when most dental extractions occur, although for any given individual it is more likely to occur with increasing age. Other possible risk factors include periodontal disease, acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, local bone disease, Paget's disease of bone, osteopetrosis, cemento-osseous dysplasia, a history of previously developing a dry socket with past extractions and inadequate oral hygiene. Other factors in the postoperative period that may lead to loss of the blood clot include forceful spitting, sucking through a straw, and coughing or sneezing. Etymology Alveolar refers to the alveolus, the alveolar processes of the mandible or maxilla; osteitis is derived from oste-, from Greek, osteon meaning \\"bone\\"; and -itis means a disease characterized by inflammation. Osteitis generally refers to localized inflammation of bone with no progression through marrow spaces (compare with osteomyelitis). Often, the term alveolar osteitis is considered synonymous with \\"dry socket\\", but some specify that dry socket is a focal or localized alveolar osteitis. An example of another type of osteitis is focal sclerosing/condensing osteitis. The name dry socket is used because the socket has a dry appearance once the blood clot is lost and debris is washed away.

Reed, along with Mike Pringle and Johnny Bright, is one of the players most often mentioned as being the greatest running back in CFL history. In November 2006, Reed was voted one of the CFL's Top 50 players (#2) of the league's modern era by Canadian sports network TSN. Reed played his entire 13-year professional football career for the CFL Saskatchewan Roughriders and his #34 jersey is one of eight that has been retired by the club. His daughter Georgette represented Canada in the 1992 Summer Olympics in the shot put competition.  College career  Reed played Pacific-8 Conference college football with the Washington State University Cougars from 1959 to 1962 where he was teamed with fellow Canadian Football Hall of Famer Hugh Campbell.  CFL  Following college, Reed signed with the Saskatchewan Roughriders where he starred for 13 years from 1963 until 1975, 203 games in all. By the time he retired, Reed held career records in rushing yards (16,116), rushing touchdowns (134), and touchdowns (137). Reed's rushing yards total has since been surpassed by National Football League stars Emmitt Smith and Walter Payton, and, in 2004 by CFL star Mike Pringle. Pringle tied Reed's total of 137 career touchdowns, and George Reed still holds the CFL rushing for touchdowns record with 134. George Reed was voted the CFL's Most Outstanding Player for 1965 and in 1976 he was the inaugural winner of the Tom Pate Memorial Trophy for playing ability and community service. He was the MVP of the 54th Grey Cup of 1966, as Saskatchewan defeated Ottawa, his sole Grey Cup win. On October 9, 1973, in Regina, Saskatchewan, George Reed was honored with the unique proclamation of October 9 as George Reed Day. In 1972, while still an active player, Reed became the fourth president of the Canadian Football League Players' Association (CFLPA). He maintained the CFLPA presidency until 1981, six years after his retirement from the CFL. Reed returned as the sixth president of the CFLPA from 1986 to 1993.  Post-football career  A naturalized Canadian citizen who is currently the Director of Guest and Community Relations at SaskGaming, Reed was made a Member of the Order of Canada in 1978, Canada's highest civilian honour, and in 1979 was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame. In 2012 in honour of the 100th Grey Cup, Canada Post used his image on a series of commemorative postage stamps. The image was also used on presentation posters and other materials to promote the Grey Cup game and other celebrations associated with the centennial.

The screenplay by John Sweet is based on what became known as the Affair of the Diamond Necklace, an incident that helped fuel the French populace's disillusionment with the monarchy and, among other causes, eventually led to the French Revolution. The film received negative reviews from critics, but the sets, music and costume design were widely praised. Plot Jeanne de Saint-R√©my de Valois, orphaned at an early age, is determined to reclaim her noble title and the home taken from her family when she was a child. When she is rebuffed by Marie Antoinette and fails to achieve her goal through legal channels, she joins forces with the arrogant, well- connected gigolo R√©taux de Villette and her own wayward, womanizing husband Nicholas. They concoct a plan to earn her enough money to purchase the property. In 1772, King Louis XV had commissioned Parisian jewellers Boehmer & Bassenge to create an opulent , 647-diamond necklace to present to his mistress Madame du Barry, but the king died before it was completed. Hoping to recover the high cost of the necklace, its creators try to persuade Queen Marie Antoinette to purchase it. Knowing its history, she declines. Jeanne approaches debauched libertine Cardinal Louis de Rohan and introduces herself as a confidante of the Queen. For years the Cardinal has yearned to regain the Queen's favor and acquire the position of Prime Minister of France, and when he is reassured by occultist Count Cagliostro that Jeanne is legitimate, he allows himself to be seduced by her promise to intervene on his behalf. He begins to correspond with the Queen and is unaware that his letters to her are intercepted and the Queen's responses are forgeries intended to manipulate him. The tone of the letters become very intimate. The cardinal becomes more and more convinced that Marie Antoinette is in love with him, and he becomes ardently enamored of her. Jeanne allegedly arranges a meeting between the two in the gardens of the Palace of Versailles. Portraying the Queen is Nicole Leguay d'Oliva, a prostitute bearing some resemblance to her. Heavily cloaked, with her face in the shadows, she agrees to forget their past disagreements. The Cardinal believes his indiscretions have been forgiven and he once again is in the Queen's good favor. Jeanne advises the Cardinal the Queen has decided to purchase the necklace but, not wanting to offend the populace by openly buying such an expensive trinket, she wishes him to do so on her behalf, with a promise to reimburse him for the cost by the Feast of the Assumption. The Cardinal gladly agrees and presents the necklace to R√©taux de Villette, believing him to be an emissary from the Queen. Nicholas de Lamotte sells some of the diamonds, and Jeanne uses the profits to buy her family home. The Cardinal begins to panic when Jeanne disappears and his correspondence with the Queen comes to an abrupt end. Nicholas is almost arrested for selling without proper certification, but he escapes. Jeanne advises him to not sell anymore diamonds in Paris. She sends correspondence to the jewelers, saying that Antoinette is no longer interested in the necklace and they must ask the Cardinal for reimbursement. However, Minister Breteuil comes upon an anxious Boehmer on his way to the Cardinal's estate. The Cardinal is invited to visit the palace on the Feast of the Assumption, at which time he assumes he will be repaid in full and named Prime Minister. Instead, King Louis XVI, who has been made aware of his machinations by Minister Breteuil, has him imprisoned in the Bastille. Soon to follow are everyone else involved in the plot. A trial finds the Cardinal, Count Cagliostro, and Nicole Leguay d'Oliva innocent of all charges. R√©taux de Villette is found guilty and banished from France. Jeanne is found guilty and whipped and branded before being imprisoned; she later escapes to London where she publishes her memoirs and regales the locals with her tales. Eventually, Marie Antoinette, assumed to be a key player in the affair by an increasingly angry and restless populace, meets her fate on the guillotine. Via an epilogue, it is shown that Jeanne died after falling from her hotel room window and was rumored to have been killed by Royalists.

In reality, she was a member of an illegitimate branch of the family, the house of Valois-Saint-Remy, descended from Henry de Saint R√©my, an illegitimate son of Henry II. * Jeanne had two siblings; an older brother, Jacques, and a younger sister Marie-Anne. In a deleted scene, Jeanne is shown with her unnamed baby brother. *According to her memoirs, Jeanne's father was the son of a minor nobleman. Her father was deep in debt and sold off the family property when Jeanne was young. There is no mentioning of him being a reformist like in the film. He tried to regain his wealth when the family moved to Paris, but he died later and Jeanne's mother ran away, leaving her children to beg on the streets. Jeanne and her family was seen as no threat to the current monarchy. * In the film, Marie Antoinette explains that Madame du Barry, Louis XV's mistress was recently banished from the French court. In fact, du Barry was banished from Versailles in 1774 shortly before the king died from smallpox, and the necklace was presented to Antoinette in 1778, and again in 1781, she refused the necklace both times.Marie Antoniette, by Stefan Zweig, originally published in 1932The Story of the Diamond Necklace, by Henry Vizetelly, originally published in 1867 * Jeanne was in fact a con-artist, who sought to use the necklace to gain wealth, power, and possibly royal patronage. In the film, Jeanne used the diamonds as profit to buy her family estate.The Story of the Diamond Necklace, by Henry Vizetelly, originally published in 1867 * Nicolas de la Motte actually sold the diamonds in London. He did not sell any in Paris. * Jeanne did escape to London, disguised as a boy, where she died from falling from a hotel window in 1791. Some speculate that she was trying to hide from tax payers, while others say it was an act of revenge from French royalists.Marie Antoniette, by Stefan Zweig, originally published in 1932 * Count Cagliostro left France for England after he was acquitted. He later went to Rome, where he was accused and imprisoned for being a forger. He died at the Fortress of San Leo in 1795.Marie Antoniette, by Stefan Zweig, originally published in 1932The Story of the Diamond Necklace, by Henry Vizetelly, originally published in 1867 * Cardinal de Rohan actually kept the forged letters. When he was arrested, he presented the letters and the sales contract to the king, the queen, the Minister of the Court, and the Keeper of the Seals. The king furiously pointed out the forged signature \\"Marie Antoniette de France\\" and stated that royalty do not use surnames. In the film, de Rohan had the letters burned. * Cardinal de Rohan's acquittal received popular enthusiasm as a victory over the royal court, particularly the Queen. He was expelled from his position as grand almoner and he exiled himself to his abbey of Chaise-Dieu. After the revolution, he left for his bishopric at Strasbourg in Alsace. He died in Ettenheim in 1803.The Story of the Diamond Necklace, by Henry Vizetelly, originally published in 1867 Reception=Critical reception The Affair of the Necklace earned negative reviews from critics, with most of the criticism focusing on the casting of Hilary Swank as Jeanne, whom they felt didn't seem comfortable within the film's period setting and refined dialogue. The costume design and stylized period setting however were widely praised. The film currently holds a 15% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 61 reviews and holds a Metacritic score of 42 based on 22 reviews. CNN Entertainment praised Hilary Swank and Charles Shyer's contributions to the film, writing, \\"Writer/director/producer Charles Shyer is known for such lightweight comedies as Baby Boom and Father of the Bride, but he's made a major change with this lavish period piece, shot in Prague on a modest $30 million budget. He also took somewhat of a chance with Oscar winner Hilary Swank in the leading role. Her graphic portrayal of Brandon Teena in Boys Don't Cry (1999) gave no hint as to whether or not she could pull off [an] 18th-century drama complete with feathered hats and tight corsets. She can.\\". Accessed 2012-08-29. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"Shyer and Sweet bring consistent clarity and ever-increasing depth to the playing out of Jeanne's bold scheming and single- minded resolve; a tone of brisk wit gives way effortlessly to poignancy and ultimately tragedy.\\" Richard Roeper found the film to be very entertaining and was willing to overlook the script's historical liberties, stating \\"I'm sure that it's sort of a 'Fractured Fairy Tale' version of the real events that happened, but the fact that it was inspired by real-life events made me enjoy it all the more.\\" Awards The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Costume Design and the Satellite Award for Best Costume Design, but lost to Moulin Rouge! in both instances.

Plot Kevin Franklin (Sinbad) is an inner city Pittsburgh native; raised in an orphanage, he has delusions of grandeur, and talks about getting rich and driving a Porsche one day. Twenty-five years later, he drives a rusted MG Midget and all his ambitions revolve around a series of ill fated get-rich-quick schemes. A handshake loan of $5,000 from the mob grows to $50,000 through interest and penalties, resulting in him trying to skip town at Pittsburgh International Airport. He overhears a conversation between lawyer Gary Young (Phil Hartman) and his children, who are waiting to pick up his childhood friend, Derek Bond, who is now a successful, strait-laced and vegetarian dentist. Upon hearing him say that he has not seen Bond in twenty five years and does not know what he looks like, Franklin gives his baseball cap to the real Bond to throw off the two dimwitted mobsters (Tony Longo and Paul Ben-Victor) chasing him and poses as Bond to the Youngs, who take him to their posh home in Sewickley. Although he knows nothing about dentistry, Franklin still manages to convince those around him that he is in fact Derek Bond, and his affable personality makes him popular with Young's otherwise stuffy and rich associates. Young has little time for his children and his wife (Kim Greist) who runs a chain of successful new frozen yogurt businesses, which gradually builds a gap between them, largely due to the demands of his bigoted, arrogant boss (Mason Adams) at the law firm where he works; this leads to Franklin developing a bond with Young's Goth daughter, helping her stand up to her cheating boyfriend, and his young son, who has aspirations of playing pro basketball. Young eventually stands up to his boss with Franklin's support and quits the firm to be with his family. Meanwhile, the mob thugs threaten Franklin's best friend, Larry (Stan Shaw), into revealing his whereabouts, and Franklin asks him to pick him up. After he does so reluctantly, he sparks an argument with him over his lack of appreciation of friendship, causing him to realize that Young has been his friend all along. He returns to the Youngs' house only to find that the mobsters have taken them hostage, and his true identity is revealed when the real Derek Bond finally shows up. After the mobsters take Franklin away, he manages to escape, losing them in a charity marathon, where he meets up with Young, who graciously decides to help him despite his charade, in return for helping bring his family closer together. Franklin reveals that he has an instant lottery ticket he purchased the previous day for a chance at a $1,000,000 cash prize spin on a Saturday night television show, which he reluctantly gives up to the mobsters in exchange for the forgiveness of his debt. The film fast forwards to wintertime, Franklin parallel parks a shiny new red Porsche with Larry in tow, in front of the Youngs' house, appearing for a promotional party for his new best-seller book, Handbook for Houseguests, based on his experiences with them. The partygoers gather in front of the television to watch the mobsters spin the wheel for the jackpot. It initially lands on the million dollar jackpot, but then falls and lands on $5,000, much to the mafia don's dismay and Franklin's delight. During the closing credits, Young and Franklin sing a medley of food based parodies of Christmas songs, as they cook a barbecue in Youngs' backyard outside of a Christmas party.

Detection of convergent and parallel evolution at the amino acid sequence level . Mol. Biol. Evol. 14, 527-36. Parallel vs. convergent evolution Evolution at an amino acid position. In each case, the left-hand species changes from incorporating alanine (A) at a specific position within a protein in a hypothetical common ancestor deduced from comparison of sequences of several species, and now incorporates serine (S) in its present-day form. The right-hand species may undergo divergent, parallel, or convergent evolution at this amino acid position relative to that of the first species. Given a particular trait that occurs in each of two lineages descended from a specified ancestor, it is possible in theory to define parallel and convergent evolutionary trends strictly, and distinguish them clearly from one another. However the criteria for defining convergent as opposed to parallel evolution often are unclear in practice, so that arbitrary diagnosis is common in some cases. When two species are similar in a particular character, evolution is defined as parallel if the ancestors shared that similarity; if they did not, the evolution of that character in those species is defined as convergent. However, this distinction is not clear-cut. For one thing, the stated conditions are partly a matter of degree; all organisms share more or less recent common ancestors. In evolutionary biology the question of how far back to look for similar ancestors, and how similar those ancestors need to be for one to consider parallel evolution to have taken place, cannot always be resolved. Some scientists accordingly have argued that parallel evolution and convergent evolution are more or less indistinguishable. Others insist that in practice we should not shy away from the gray area because many important distinctions between parallel and convergent evolution remain. When the ancestral forms are unspecified or unknown, or the range of traits considered is not clearly specified, the distinction between parallel and convergent evolution becomes more subjective. For instance, Richard Dawkins in The Blind Watchmaker describes the striking similarity between placental and marsupial forms as the outcome of convergent evolution, because mammals on their respective ancestral continents had a long evolutionary history before the extinction of the dinosaurs. That period of separation would have permitted the accumulation of many relevant differences. Stephen Jay Gould differed; he described some of the same examples as having started from the common ancestor of all marsupials and placentals, and hence amounting to parallel evolution. And certainly, whenever similarities can be described in concept as having evolved from a common attribute deriving from a single remote ancestral line, that legitimately may be regarded as parallel evolution. In contrast, where quite different structures clearly have been co- opted to a similar form and function, one must necessarily regard the evolution as convergent. For example, consider Mixotricha paradoxa, a eukaryotic microbe which has assembled a system of rows of apparent cilia and basal bodies closely resembling the system in ciliates. However, on inspection it turns out that in Mixotricha paradoxa, what appear to be cilia actually are smaller symbiont microorganisms; there is no question of parallel evolution in such a case. Again, the differently oriented tails of fish and whales derived at vastly different times from radically different ancestors and any similarity in the resultant descendants must therefore have evolved convergently; any case in which lineages do not evolve together at the same time in the same ecospace might be described as convergent evolution at some point in time. The definition of a trait is crucial in deciding whether a change is seen as divergent, or as parallel or convergent. For example, the evolution of the sesamoid \\"thumb\\" of the giant panda certainly is not parallel to that of the thumbs of primates, particularly hominins, and it also differs morphologically from primate thumbs, but from some points of view it might be regarded as convergent in function and appearance. Again, in the image above, note that since serine and threonine possess similar structures with an alcohol side chain, the example marked \\"divergent\\" would be termed \\"parallel\\" if the amino acids were grouped by similarity instead of being considered individually. As another example, if genes in two species independently become restricted to the same region of the animals through regulation by a certain transcription factor, this may be described as a case of parallel evolution - but examination of the actual DNA sequence will probably show only divergent changes in individual basepair positions, since a new transcription factor binding site can be added in a wide range of places within the gene with similar effect. A similar situation occurs considering the homology of morphological structures. For example, many insects possess two pairs of flying wings. In beetles, the first pair of wings is hardened into elytra, wing covers with little role in flight, while in flies the second pair of wings is condensed into small halteres used for balance. If the two pairs of wings are considered as interchangeable, homologous structures, this may be described as a parallel reduction in the number of wings, but otherwise the two changes are each divergent changes in one pair of wings. Similar to convergent evolution, evolutionary relay describes how independent species acquire similar characteristics through their evolution in similar ecosystems, but not at the same time, such as the dorsal fins of sharks, cetaceans and ichthyosaurs.  Examples  *Colouration that serves as a warning to predators and for mating displays has evolved in many different species. *In the plant kingdom, the most familiar examples of parallel evolution are the forms of leaves, where very similar patterns have appeared again and again in separate genera and families. *In Arabidopsis thaliana it has been suggested that populations adapt to local climate through parallel evolution Stearns, F. W. and C. B. Fenster (2013). Evidence for parallel adaptation across the natural range of Arabidopsis thaliana. Ecology & Evolution. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.622/full *In butterflies, many close similarities are found in the patterns of wing colouration, both within and among families. *Old and New World porcupines shared a common ancestor, both evolved strikingly similar quill structures; this is also an example of convergent evolution as similar structures evolved in hedgehogs, echidnas and tenrecs. *Some extinct archosaurs evolved an upright posture and likely were warm-blooded. These two characteristics are also found in most mammals. Modern crocodiles have a four chambered heart and a crurotarsal, the latter being also a characteristic of therian mammals. *The extinct pterosaurs and the birds both evolved wings as well as a distinct beak, but not from a recent common ancestor. *Internal fertilization has evolved independently in sharks, some amphibians and amniotes. *The patagium is a fleshy membrane that is found in gliding mammals such as flying lemurs, flying squirrels, sugar gliders and the extinct Volaticotherium. These mammals all acquired the patagium independently. *Pyrotherians evolved a body plan similar to proboscideans. *The extinct South American litoptern ungulate Thoatherium had legs that are difficult to distinguish from those of horses. *The eye of the octopus has the same complicated structure as the human eye. As a result, it is often substituted in studies of the eye when using a human eye would be inappropriate. As the two species diverged at the time animals evolved into vertebrates and invertebrates this is extraordinary. *Certain arboreal frog species, 'flying' frogs, in both Old World families and New World families have developed the ability of gliding flight. They have \\"enlarged hands and feet, full webbing between all fingers and toes, lateral skin flaps on the arms and legs, and reduced weight per snout-vent length\\". Emerson, S.B., & Koehl, M.A.R. (1990). \\"The interaction of behavioral and morphological change in the evolution of a novel locomotor type: 'Flying' frogs.\\" Evolution, 44(8), 1931-1946 *The tree plant habit has evolved separately in unrelated classes of plants. = Parallel evolution between marsupials and placentals = A number of examples of parallel evolution are provided by the two main branches of the mammals, the placentals and marsupials, which have followed independent evolutionary pathways following the break-up of land-masses such as Gondwanaland roughly 100 million years ago. In South America, marsupials and placentals shared the ecosystem (before the Great American Interchange); in Australia, marsupials prevailed; and in the Old World and North America the placentals won out. However, in all these localities mammals were small and filled only limited places in the ecosystem until the mass extinction of dinosaurs sixty-five million years ago. At this time, mammals on all three landmasses began to take on a much wider variety of forms and roles. While some forms were unique to each environment, surprisingly similar animals have often emerged in two or three of the separated continents. Examples of these include the placental sabre-toothed cats (Machairodontinae) and the South American marsupial sabre-tooth (Thylacosmilus); the Tasmanian wolf and the European wolf; likewise marsupial and placental moles, flying squirrels, and (arguably) mice.

On February 13, 2019, Publicis announced that Publicis.Sapient, SapientRazorfish, and Sapient Consulting had become one brand, Publicis Sapient, led by CEO Nigel Vaz. On Jan. 14, 2020, Jem Ripley, Publicis Communications East CEO, confirmed that Publicis is bringing back the Razorfish name for its digital marketing agency, consisting of clients that didn't fit into Publicis Sapient's digital transformation strategy. History=Beginnings Razorfish was founded in New York in 1994 by childhood friends Craig Kanarick and Jeff Dachis, with the motto \\"Solutions to Hard Problems.\\" The company was originally headquartered at Jeff's apartment in Alphabet City in Manhattan. Their first major project was a $20,000 assignment to create a small website for the New York Botanical Society, commissioned by Time Warner's Pathfinder business unit. A few months later, they moved into an office at 580 Broadway and hired three new employees. Early success The company generated over $300,000 in revenues in 1995 and over $1.2m in 1996, with a $300k EBITDA profit. They were one of the first companies to have an animated homepage, utilizing the \\"server-push\\" capabilities of the latest version of the Netscape browser. Because of this and aggressive marketing tactics the firm grew quickly over the next few years. Soon thereafter, they received a strategic investment from Omnicom (along with other New Media pioneers, Agency.com, Red Sky Interactive, Think New Ideas and Organic), making them one of the first firms to be financed by a traditional media holding company. Razorfish used this money to move to new offices, redesign their branding (to include the slogan \\"Everything that can be digital will be.\\") and expand operations. It and other New York-based Web design companies formed the core of a cluster of New Media companies known as Silicon Alley. In 1997, the company generated over $3.6 million in revenues, with a healthy portfolio of prestigious clients like KPMG and Charles Schwab. In January 1998, Razorfish made its first of what was to be many acquisitions, by purchasing Avalanche Systems. In 1998, Razorfish also acquired Plastic in San Francisco, London-based CHBi, Los Angeles-based <tag> media, and then merged with Scandinavian interactive leader, Spray, which had offices in Sweden, Finland, Norway and Germany. The company generated over $83 million in revenue in 1998 and was profitable, putting it on solid ground for an IPO. The company had over 1,100 employees at the time. In April 1999, the company had an IPO which raised $48 million at $16 per share. In fall 1999, Razorfish acquired International Integration, Inc. (I-Cube),Short Take: Razorfish acquires i-Cube CNET, November 2, 1999. a Boston-based company founded by Yannis Doganis, Madhav Anand, and Edouard (Eddie) Aslanian, its largest deal to date. The company's sales for 1999 topped $170 million. In May 2000, Razorfish announced the launch of Intervision-Razorfish, a joint venture based in Tokyo. Around the same time, as the entire industry started to feel the effects of the dot-com bubble, Razorfish saw Q4 revenues of $50.1m, a 5% drop from the year before. Total revenues for 2000 were almost $268 million. In February 2001, Razorfish laid off 400 employees, roughly 20 percent of its staff, with its stock price descending from a February 2000 high of $57 to just $1 per share. 60 Minutes II interview In February 2000, Craig Kanarick and Jeff Dachis were interviewed by Bob Simon on 60 Minutes II, where they appeared unable to answer the question, \\"What do you do?\\".The Dot-Com Kids CBS News February 15, 2000.> The interview was widely viewed as a complete disaster.Brattitude Adjustment Wired September 1, 2000.

Razorfish continued to function as an independent company as part of Microsoft Advertising, run by Brian McAndrews, formerly CEO of aQuantive, who reported directly to the president of Microsoft's Platforms & Services Division. On October 20, 2008, the company decided to be known as Razorfish, dropping the Avenue A brand. In June 2009, it was reported that Microsoft had put the company up for sale. Acquisition by Publicis Groupe Microsoft had earlier in June 2009 notified the markets of its intention to sell Razorfish, which many believed conflicted with Microsoft Advertising's main operations that sell advertising technology services to rival agencies. On August 9, Paris-based holding company Publicis Groupe agreed to acquire Razorfish from Microsoft for US$530 million in cash and shares, which in turn gave Microsoft a 3% equity stake in Publicis Groupe. Clark Kokich had served as CEO of the company since July 2007; however, in April 2008, Bob Lord was named the new CEO, while Kokich took on the newly formed role of Chairman. In July 2013, Pete Stein was promoted to the role of Global CEO. Stein had been part of the executive leadership team for five years. Pete was succeed as the CEO by Tom Adamski and then by Shannon Denton. In October 2015, Tom Adamski died of cancer.

In about 367 BC, he fought under the Athenian general Iphicrates against Amphipolis. Being ordered by Iphicrates to take the Amphipolitan hostages to Athens, he allowed them to return to their own people, and joined Cotys, king of Thrace, against Athens. Soon afterwards he fell into the hands of the Athenians and accepted the offer of Timotheus to re-enter their service. Having been dismissed by Timotheus (362 BC) he joined the revolting satraps and their generals Memnon and Mentor in Asia, but soon lost their confidence, and was obliged to seek the protection of the Athenians. Finding, however, that he had nothing to fear from the Persians, he again joined Cotys, on whose murder he was appointed guardian to his youthful son Cersobleptes. In 357 BC, on the arrival of Chares with considerable forces, the Thracian Chersonese was restored to Athens. The supporters of Charidemus represented this as due to his efforts, and, in spite of the opposition of Demosthenes, he was honored with a golden crown and the franchise of the city. It was further resolved that his person should be inviolable. In 351 BC, he commanded the Athenian forces in the Chersonese against Philip II of Macedon, and in 349 BC he superseded Chares as commander in the Olynthian War. He achieved little success, but made himself detested by his insolence and profligacy, and was in turn replaced by Chares. After the battle of Chaeronea the war party would have entrusted Charidemus with the command against Philip, but the peace party secured the appointment of Phocion. He was one of those whose surrender was demanded by Alexander the Great after the destruction of Thebes, but escaped with banishment. He fled to Darius III, who received him with distinction. But, having expressed his dissatisfaction with the preparations made by the king just before the battle of Issus (333 BC), he was put to death.

It has a melting temperature of about 3250 degrees Celsius. It is an unusual ceramic, having relatively high thermal and electrical conductivities, properties it shares with isostructural titanium diboride and zirconium diboride. It is a grey, metallic looking material. Hafnium diboride has a hexagonal crystal structure, a molar mass of 200.11 grams per mole, and a density of 10.5 grams per cubic centimeter. Hafnium diboride is often combined with carbon, boron, silicon, silicon carbide, and/or nickel to improve the consolidation of the hafnium diboride powder (sintering). It is commonly formed into a solid by a process called hot pressing, where the powders are pressed together using both heat and pressure. The material has potential for use in hypervelocity reentry vehicles such as ICBM heat shields or aerodynamic leading-edges, due to its strength and thermal properties. Unlike polymer and composite material, HfB2 can be formed into aerodynamic shapes that will not ablate during reentry. Hafnium diboride is also investigated as a possible new material for nuclear reactor control rods. It is also being investigated as a microchip diffusion barrier. If synthesized correctly, the barrier can be less than 7 nm in thickness.

He was the longest living (101), and oldest serving Polish President (from the age of 88 to 95).  Biography  Relief of the Raczy≈Ñski family comital coat of arms Nalecz coat of arms Count Edward Bernard Maria Raczy≈Ñski was born December 19, 1891 in Zakopane, to a Polish aristocratic family. His father was Count Edward Aleksander Raczy≈Ñski of Na≈Çƒôcz coat of arms, and his mother R√≥≈ºa n√©e Countess Potocka. The Raczy≈Ñskis were related to the Austro-Hungarian house of Habsburgs. The full name was \\"Raczy≈Ñski z Ma≈Çyszyna\\", as they were a branch of the noble family Na≈Çƒôcz-Ma≈Çyski from Greater Poland (the area of the town of Wielu≈Ñ) and about 1540 took their name from the estate of Raczyn near Wielu≈Ñ. However, the Raczy≈Ñskis remained relatively unknown until the 18th century, when four of them became Senators of Poland under different reigns. One of the Raczy≈Ñskis became a Knight of the Order of the White Eagle during the reign of King August the Strong, six of them were awarded the Virtuti Militari order during the time of Duchy of Warsaw and three received the same distinction during the November Uprising of 1831. The title of Count was awarded to different branches of the family by Prussian Kings Friedrich Wilhelm III (in 1824) and Wilhelm II (in 1905). One of their kin was a Knight of the highest Prussian Order of the Black Eagle. Raczy≈Ñski spent most of his childhood in Krak√≥w, in the family palace Pod Baranami and in the family palace in Rogalin in Greater Poland. He studied law in Lipsk, Krak√≥w, and London (the London School of Economics) and was awarded with a doctorate of the Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w in 1915. In November 1918, Raczynski joined the army of the resuscitated Poland, from which he was called to the diplomatic service in May 1919. Until 1925, he worked in Polish embassies and missions in Bern, Copenhagen and London. Back in Warsaw, he became the head of the department of international agreements. In 1932, Raczy≈Ñski was appointed Polish ambassador to the League of Nations and in 1934 he became the ambassador of the Republic of Poland in the United Kingdom. On behalf of Poland, he signed the Polish-British allianceWikisource:Agreement of Mutual Assistance between the United Kingdom and Poland-London (1939) (August 25, 1939) which ultimately led the United Kingdom to declare war on Nazi Germany after the country's invasion. World War II Last page \\"Raczy≈Ñski's Note\\" - official note of Polish government-in-exile to Anthony Eden 10 December 1942. Following the September 1, 1939 German Invasion of Poland Raczy≈Ñski remained in London where he continued to serve as the ambassador of the Polish Government in Exile and one of its prominent members. Between July 22, 1941 and July 14, 1943 he was also the Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs in the cabinet of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski. In this capacity, he provided the Allies with one of the earliest and most accurate accounts of the ongoing Holocaust (\\"The mass extermination of Jews in German occupied Poland\\", Raczy≈Ñski's Note addressed to the Governments of the United Nations on December 10, 1942\\")\\"The mass extermination of Jews in German occupied Poland, Note addressed to the Governments of the United Nations on December 10, 1942\\" published later (30 decembre 1942) by the Polish Foreign Ministry as a brochure distributed to politicians and the medias : http://www.projectinposterum.org/docs/mass_extermination.htm and pleaded for action.Martin Gilbert, Auschwitz and the Allies, 1981 (Pimlico edition, p. 96) \\"Further pressure for action came from the Polish Ambassador, Count Raczynski, who, at a meeting with Anthony Eden on the morning of december 1 (1942) \\"drew attention\\", as the Foreign Office noted, \\"to the wholesale destruction of Jews in Poland\\" (..) Raczynski had two suggestions : a \\"warning to Laval\\" concerning the deportations from France, and a meeting of representatives of the occupied countries to discuss and publicize the persecution. But the Foreign Office rejected the idea of such a meeting\\"Walter Laqueur, The terrible secret, 1980 (Penguin edition, p. 236). \\"On January 18, 1943 Count Raczynski, the Polish Foreign Minister, presented the following demands at the Allied Council : a) The bombing of Germany as a reprisal for the continued extermination of the Polish Jews. b) To press Berlin to let the Jews out of the German-dominated countries, particularly Poland. c) To demand action so as to make the Allied as well as the neutral countries accept the Jews, who had succeeded or would succeed in leaving German-occupied countries. Raczynski did not advance demands for reprisals against German war prisoners and German nationals living in the Allied countries, considering them contrary to the accepted practices of international law. Anthony Eden, acting on behalf of the British Government, rejected the Polish demands and offered instead some vague promises to intervene in certain neutral countries\\" Later life After 1945, when the government of the United Kingdom broke the pacts with Poland and withdrew support for the Polish government, Raczy≈Ñski remained in London, where he acted as one of the most notable members of Polish diaspora there. He was active in various political and social organisations in exile, including the Fundusz Pomocy Krajowi (Help for the Country Fund) which actively supported the democratic opposition in communist-controlled Poland. Between 1954 and 1972 he was one of the members of the Council of the Three, the collective presidential body of the Polish government in exile. He was also a member of the Committee for Polish Affairs and an advisor of various British governmental agencies and ministries. Sarcophagus of President Edward Raczy≈Ñski in Rogalin In March 1979, Raczy≈Ñski became President in exile, after being previously chosen by the outgoing President Stanis≈Çaw Ostrowski. In turn, he chose as his successor Prime Minister Kazimierz Sabbat. During the Raczy≈Ñski presidency (1979‚Äì1986) the Solidarity movement was established in Poland. Raczy≈Ñski played an important role in raising awareness about the events in Poland in Western countries and in establishing closer ties with the opposition movement in Poland. President Raczy≈Ñski at some point considered naming W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski as his successor, as he wanted to choose someone \\"from the country\\" and with strong ties to the Polish opposition movement. Bartoszewski, however, declined the offer.Micha≈Ç Komar, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski, SkƒÖd pan jest? (a long interview). ≈öwiat KsiƒÖ≈ºki, Warszawa, 2006 After serving a 7-year term he resigned from his post on April 8, 1986.

Death and legacy Raczy≈Ñski died on July 30, 1993, at his home in London as the last male descendant of his line. His coffin was placed in the mausoleum of his family located at the chapel in Rogalin. In his last will and testament, Count Raczy≈Ñski bequeathed his family's palace in Rogalin, and his library to the Polish nation. He was the longest living head of state in Poland's history and one of the very few centenarians among European politicians of the 20th century.See also his obituary and short biography by the historian and writer Adam Zamoyski in an article for \\"The Independent\\" of 31 July 1993 : https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-count- edward-raczynski-1488283.html In 2004, a blue plaque was installed on the house where he lived and died, No. 8 Lennox Gardens in Brompton.

He has written over 300 Chinese-language wuxia and science fiction novels, and more than 400 film scripts.  Life  Ni was born in Ningbo, Zhejiang, but grew up in Shanghai. He worked as a public security official under the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) government in the 1950s in Inner Mongolia and was tasked with writing death sentences. He once questioned the local party chief about why a particular man was sentenced to death, when the offence he committed (as stated on paper) was for being a landlord. The chief threatened to execute him if he continued to ask questions. According to Ni, he complied with the order because he feared for his own life. This was not the only instance in which Ni wrote a questionable death sentence which was categorised under \\"others\\" by the CCP government. These experiences made Ni decide to escape from China to Hong Kong in 1957. Ni's science fiction novels usually take the form of detective/mystery stories featuring extraterrestrial life as a deus ex machina to explain the impossible and implausible. His best known works are the Wisely Series (Wai See-lei Ë°õÊñØÁêÜ) and Dr Yuen (Yuen Chun-hap ÂéüÊåØ‰ø†) novel series, both of which have been adapted into films and television series. His criticism of communism is evident in some of these works. Ni also co-wrote scripts with Chang Cheh for the Shaw Brothers Studio, including for the films One-Armed Swordsman, The Assassin and Crippled Avengers. As the screenwriter for the 1972 film Fist of Fury, he didn't received credit for creating the protagonist, Chen Zhen, who was played by Bruce Lee. The credits listed director Lo Wei as author. Chen Zhen became a popular Chinese culture hero and the subject of numerous remakes and adaptations of Fist of Fury. Notable actors such as Jet Li and Donnie Yen have portrayed Chen Zhen on screen after Bruce Lee. Ni wrote the screenplay for China's first superhero film Inframan. Ni is a friend and fan of the wuxia writer Louis Cha (Jin Yong). He wrote at least one extended segment in Cha's novel Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils when Cha was on holiday in Europe, although much of his additions were excised in Cha's first revision. Ni, while helping Cha write nearly 40 days of serialisation while Cha was abroad, made A'zi, a character in Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils, blind in the story.Ni Kuang, ÊàëÁúãÈáëÂ∫∏Â∞èËØ¥ (I Read Jin Yong's Novels). Cha has since edited his novel. In 1992, Ni migrated to the United States, where he continued his writing career, when he heard that the British were planning to transfer the sovereignty of Hong Kong to the Chinese government. However, he returned to Hong Kong in 2006 because his wife could not adjust to the lifestyle in the United States. Personal life Ni has four brothers and two sisters: Ni Yifang (ÂÄ™‰∫¶Êñπ), Ni Yixiu (ÂÄ™‰∫¶ÁßÄ), Ni Yijian (ÂÄ™‰∫¶ÂÑâ), Ni Yiping (ÂÄ™‰∫¶Âπ≥), Ni Yishu (ÂÄ™‰∫¶Ëàí) and Ni Yijing (ÂÄ™‰∫¶Èùñ). He is married to Li Guozhen (ÊùéÊûúÁèç) while his younger brother, Ni Yiping, is married to Li's younger sister. Ni and Li Guozhen have a son and daughter. Their son, Joe Nieh (ÂÄ™Èúá; Ni Zhen), who works in the Hong Kong entertainment industry, is married to actress Vivian Chow. Their daughter is Ni Sui (ÂÄ™Á©ó).  Political views  Ni is a known anti-communist. In an interview, when asked about his feelings regarding injustice in China, he stated that the people would continue suffering as long as the Chinese Communist Party remains in existence.

Early life Christy was born at Kingston upon Thames, the second son of William Miller Christy of Woodbines, a Quaker banker who started out in hat manufacture with interests in Stockport, before becoming a financier.Humphrey Lloyd. The Quaker Lloyds in the Industrial Revolution 1660-1860 (2006), p. 285; Google Books. Trained to business by his father, Henry Christy became a partner in the house of Christy & Co. in Gracechurch Street, and succeeded his father as a director of the London Joint-Stock Bank. He was still a board member of the bank at the end of his life, despite other activities.The Bankers' Magazine, and journal of the money market (1865), p. 180; archive.org. Henry contributed to the success of the family firm, known as W. M. Christy & Sons Ltd. once his father took it over. Samples of textiles he brought home from the Ottoman Empire provided the idea for looped cotton towelling, taken up by his brother Richard, and amenable to mechanical manufacture with a technique devised by an employee.John Rylands University Library, Papers of W. M. Christy & Sons Ltd. Christy also innovated with woven silk rather than beaver for the manufacture of top hats.Jonathan C. H. King, First Peoples, First Contacts: native peoples of North America (1999), p. 218; Google Books. Interests Christy was a philanthropist, active in the Great Famine and other causes. With other Quakers Christy took the approach of buying seeds for other vegetable crops, to reduce the potato monoculture. With committee members Robert Forster and Samuel Fox, he also lobbied the government for practical help in improving Irish fisheries. He was one of the founders of the Aborigines' Protection Society.Richard King, Obituary of Thomas Hodgkin, M.D., Transactions of the Ethnological Society of London, Vol. 5, (1867), pp. 341-345\\\\.

Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/60211083 Christy was also involved in numerous learned societies. He belonged to both the Ethnological Society of London and the Anthropological Society of London, representing different strands arising from early ethnology.George W.

He took part in both the archaeological societies of the period, and the Royal Geographical Society.Andrew L. Christenson, Tracing Archaeology's Past: the historiography of archaeology (1989), pp. 158‚Äì9; Google Books. He was also a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and sponsored the application for membership there of Augustus Lane Fox (later Pitt Rivers), the other major British collector of the time in the ethnographic field.Mark Bowden, Pitt Rivers: the life and archaeological work of Lieutenant-General Augustus Henry Lane Fox Pitt Rivers, DCL, FRS, FSA (1991), p. 48; Google Books. Travels and collecting In 1850 Christy began to visit foreign countries. Among the fruits of his first expedition to the East were an extensive collection of Eastern fabrics, and a large series of figures from Cyprus, which are now in the British Museum. After the Great Exhibition of 1851, Christy began the study of tribal peoples. In 1852, and again in 1853, he travelled in Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. The public collections of antiquities at Stockholm and Copenhagen were a revelation to him, and from this time he collected objects from contemporary and prehistoric periods. The year 1856 was devoted to America. Travelling over Canada, the United States, and British Columbia, Christy met Edward Burnett Tylor in Cuba, and they went on together to Mexico, where Christy made many purchases. Their Mexican travels were described by Tylor in his Anahuac (London, 1861). Plaques in tribute to Edouard Lartet and Henry Christy, Les Eyzies de Tayac, Dordogne, France. In 1858, the antiquity of man was proved by the discoveries of Boucher de Perthes on flint implements in France; Christy joined the Geological Society that year. He went with the French pal√¶ontologist Edouard Lartet in the examination of the caves along the valley of the V√©z√®re, a tributary of the Dordogne River, in the south of France. Remains are embedded in the stalagmites of these caves. Thousands of specimens were obtained, some of them being added to Christy's collection. The sites they investigated included Le Moustier, the Abri de la Madeleine, both important type sites. Death In April 1865, Christy left England with a small party of geologists to examine some caves which had recently been discovered in Belgium, near Dinant. While at work he caught a severe cold. A subsequent journey with M. and Mme. Lartet to La Palisse brought on inflammation of the lungs, of which he died on 4 May 1865. Collections and legacy By his will, Christy bequeathed his collections of modern objects to the nation; his archaeological collection went to the nation, but with the finds from excavations in France to be shared with the French Mus√©e d'Arch√©ologie Nationale, which was to get the most important pieces.Acquisition note, British Museum He also left ¬£5000 which established the Christy fund that allowed the British Museum to purchase many more artefacts;Christy Fund, British Museum, accessed August 2010 with a sum of money to be applied to public exhibition. As there was then no spare room at the British Museum, the trustees secured the suite of rooms at 103 Victoria Street, London SW (in which Christy himself had lived) and here the collection was exhibited, under the care of A. W. Franks, until 1884. The young Charles Hercules Read, later Franks's successor as Keeper at the British Museum, was based there doing the cataloguing, in his first work for the museum. In that year the removal of the natural history department to South Kensington made room for the collection at the British Museum. Christy had a partial catalogue of his collections made in 1862, by Carl Ludvig Steinhauer.British Museum, biography of Christy. In 1864 he wrote an account of the work which was being carried out at his expense in the V√©z√®re Valley; these notices appeared in the Comptes rendus (29 February 1864) and Transactions of the Ethnological Society of London (21 June 1864). They referred mainly to the \\"reindeer period\\", as the time of the cavemen in southern France then came to be styled. Christy's funding contributed to the discovery of Cro-Magnon man in 1868 in a cave near Les Eyzies. An account of the explorations appeared in a half-finished book left by Christy, entitled Reliquiae Aquitanicae, being contributions to the Archaeology and Paleontology of P√©rigord and the adjacent provinces of Southern France; this was completed by Christy's executors, first by Lartet and, after his death in 1870, by Thomas Rupert Jones.

The railroad serves as a link between Class I railroads and local industries in northeast Illinois and northwest Indiana. It built the South Shore Line electric interurban and operated it until 1990, when it transferred it to the Northern Indiana Commuter Transportation District. The railroad is owned by the Anacostia Rail Holdings Company. History electric freight locomotive The South Shore Line is the last remaining of the once numerous electric interurban trains in the United States. The South Shore began in 1901 as the Chicago and Indiana Air Line Railway, a streetcar route between East Chicago and Indiana Harbor. Reorganized as the Chicago, Lake Shore and South Bend Railway in 1904, by 1908 its route had reached South Bend, Indiana via Michigan City, Indiana. The company leased the Kensington and Eastern Railroad, an Illinois Central Railroad subsidiary, to gain access to Chicago. Passenger service between South Bend and Chicago began in 1909. The Lake Shore added freight service in 1916. Samuel Insull acquired the bankrupt Lake Shore in 1925 and reorganized it as the Chicago South Shore and South Bend Railroad, which it remains today. The railroad experienced two more bankruptcies, in 1933 and 1938. The post- World War II decline in traffic hurt the company, and it was bought by the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O;) in 1967. In 1977 the Northern Indiana Commuter Transportation District (NICTD) began subsidizing the passenger operations on the South Shore Line. In 1984 the Venango River Corporation (VRC) purchased the South Shore from the C&O.; Venango declared bankruptcy in 1989. In 1990 the Anacostia and Pacific Company acquired the South Shore. The NICTD purchased the passenger assets. The South Shore acquired the Kensington and Eastern Railroad from the Illinois Central Railroad in 1996.

Handheld clustered Suzu, similar to jingle bells, are used musically at Shinto ceremonies. There are ceremonies, for instance, where female performers dance with suzu bells such as those with some sort of short blade at its center. The bell's cool tinkles are also considered psychological air-conditioning for the summer since their clear ringing is considered cool and refreshing. In Edo Castle the larger corridor to the ≈åoku which only the sh≈çgun as the only male was allowed to enter, was called , derived from the ringing of the suzu bells to announce his entrance. Suzu were traditionally made by metal craft artisans. With the onset of industrialisation, they were made by machines. The ones produced by hand however are still considered of higher quality due to the richer and more melodious sound.  Other references  Suzu is also a female name in Japan meaning \\"Bell\\" or \\"Tin\\". The kanji for suzu is often used to form a compound name, such as the well-known surname Suzuki, meaning \\"bell and tree\\".

The word comes from the past participle of the Latin verb voveo, vovere, \\"vow, promise\\". As the result of this verbal action, a votum is also that which fulfills a vow, that is, the thing promised, such as offerings, a statue, or even a temple building. The votum is thus an aspect of the contractual nature of Roman religion, a bargaining expressed by do ut des, \\"I give that you might give.\\"John Scheid, \\"Sacrifices for Gods and Ancestors\\", in A Companion to Roman Religion (Blackwell, 2007), p. 270; William Warde Fowler, The Religious Experience of the Roman People (London, 1922), pp. 200‚Äì202. Private vota Silvanus; the inscription ends with the abbreviation V.S.L.M. (votum solvit libens merito) In everyday life, individuals might make votive offerings to a deity for private concerns. Vota privata are attested in abundance by inscriptions, particularly for the later Imperial era. These are regularly marked with the letters V.S.L.M., votum solvit libens merito, noting that the person making the dedication \\"He has fulfilled his vow, willingly, as it should.\\" William Warde Fowler found in these offerings \\"expressions of ‚Ä¶ religious feeling\\" and a gratitude for blessings received that go deeper than contractual formalism.Fowler, Religious Experience, pp. 201‚Äì202. Military vota During the Republican era, the votum was a regular part of ceremonies conducted at the Capitoline by a general holding imperium before deploying.Mary Beard, J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, Religions of Rome: A History (Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 15. The triumph with its dedication of spoils and animal sacrifices at the Capitol was in part a fulfillment of such a vow.Friederike Fless and Katja Moede, \\"Music and Dance: Forms of Representation in Pictorial and Written Sources\\", in A Companion to Roman Religion, pp. 259‚Äì260. A general who faced an uncertain outcome in battle might make a votum in the field promising to build a temple out of gratitude for divine aid in a victory. In 311 BC, Junius Bubulcus became the first plebeian general to vow and oversee the building of a temple; he honored the goddess Salus, \\"Salvation\\".Anna Clark, Divine Qualities: Cult and Community in Republican Rome (Oxford University Press, 2007), p. 50; Richard D. Weigel, \\"Roman Generals and the Vowing of Temples, 500‚Äì100 B.C.\\", Classica et Mediaevalia (Museum Tusculanum Press, 1998), p. 122; Eric M. Orlin, Temples, Religion, and Politics in the Roman Republic (Brill, 1997), pp. 179‚Äì180. A vow would also be made in connection with the ritual of evocatio, negotiations with the enemy's tutelary deity to offer superior cult. An extreme form of votum was the devotio, the ritual by which a general sacrificed himself in battle and asked the chthonic deities to take the enemy as offerings along with him.Fowler, Religious Experience, pp. 206‚Äì207. Public vota In the Republic, vota pro salute rei publicae (\\"vows for the security of the republic\\") were offered at the beginning of the year, on the day the consuls took office.Frances Hickson-Hahn, \\"The Politics of Thanksgiving\\", in Augusto augurio: rerum humanarum et divinarum commentationes in honorem Jerzy Linderski (Franz Steiner, 2004), pp. 35‚Äì36. Under the Empire, the people assembled on January 3 to offer collective vows for the salus (\\"health, safety, wellbeing\\") of the emperor.Peter Herz, \\"Emperors: Caring for the Empire and Their Successors\\", in A Companion to Roman Religion, p. 312; Fowler, Religious Experience, p. 200. Offerings were made to Jupiter, Juno, Salus, and sometimes other deities.J. Rufus Fears, \\"The Cult of Jupiter and Roman Imperial Ideology\\", Aufstieg und Nierdergang der r√∂mischen Welt II.17.2 (1981), p. 98. These vows originated in 30 BC, when the senate decreed vota on behalf of Octavian (later Augustus) as princeps.Duncan Fishwick, The Imperial Cult in the Latin West (Brill, 1987), vol. I,1, p. 89. The vota for the state continued on January 1, while those on behalf of the emperor and his family became fixed on January 3. In Rome, these ceremonies were conducted by the consuls and pontiffs, and in the provinces probably by governors and local priests and officials.Fishwick, The Imperial Cult in the Latin West, pp. 89‚Äì90. Vota publica continued even after Christianity had become the official religion of the Empire, and possibly as late as the 6th century.Fritz Graf, \\"Roman Festivals in Syria Palaestina\\", in The Talmud Yerushalmi and Graeco- Roman Culture (Mohr Siebeck, 2002), vol. 3, p. 441. Because the vows were as much affirmations of political loyalty as religious expressions, they were difficult to abolish without undermining the sacral aura of the emperor's authority.Fears, \\"The Cult of Jupiter and Roman Imperial Ideology\\", pp. 99‚Äì105, 119‚Äì122. Fears explores the question through the transition from the cult of Jupiter to that of the Christian god: \\"Appropriating the central role of Jupiter Optimus Maximus in the theology of victory, the Christian god passed easily into his pre-eminent position in the imperial ideology of the Christian Empire. ‚Ä¶ Like the theology of victory, the theme of the royal office as an imitatio Dei was easily Christianized. ‚Ä¶ It is precisely in this association of emperor with the high god that we observe most clearly that continuity between pagan and Christian imperial ideology\\" (pp. 121‚Äì122).

Oil on canvas, 1622 by Antonio de Pereda. From about the third or fourth century onwards, the child Jesus is frequently shown in paintings, and sculpture. Commonly these are nativity scenes showing the birth of Jesus, with his mother Mary, and her husband Joseph. Depictions as a baby with the Virgin Mary, known as Madonna and Child, are iconographical types in Eastern and Western traditions. Other scenes from his time as a baby, of his circumcision, presentation at the temple, the adoration of the Magi, and the flight into Egypt, are common.Ferguson, George. Signs & symbols in Christian art, 1966, Oxford University Press US, p.76 Scenes showing his developing years are more rare but not unknown. Saint Joseph, Anthony of Padua, and Saint Christopher are often depicted holding the Christ Child.

These icons of the Christ Child was often posed in the contrapposto style in which the positioning of the knees reflected in the opposite direction, similar to ancient depictions of the Roman Emperor. The images were quite popular among nobility of Spain and Portugal. Colonial images of the Christ child also began to wear vestments, a pious practice developed by the santero culture in later colonial years, carrying the depiction of holding the globus cruciger, a bird symbolizing a soul or the Holy Spirit or various paraphernalia related to its locality or region. The symbolism of the Child Jesus in art reached its apex during the Renaissance: the Holy Family was a central theme in the works of Leonardo da Vinci and many other masters.\\"Holy Family\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online T√†ladh Chr√¨osda T√†ladh Chr√¨osda (Christ Child Lullaby) is a Scottish carol from Moidart, Scotland.

He originally wrote 29 verses in Scottish Gaelic, but the popular English translation is limited to five. The melody, Cumha Mhic Arois (lament for Mac √Ärois), is from the Hebrides and was a sung as a protective charm for the fisherman away at sea. The rhythm mirrors the rhythm of the surf.

These stories were intended to show Jesus as having extraordinary gifts of power and knowledge, even from the youngest age. One common pious tale has the young Jesus animating sparrows out of clay belonging to his playmates. When admonished for doing so on the Sabbath, he causes the birds to fly away.

Life Madeleine Dring spent the first four years of her life at Raleigh Road, Harringay, before the family moved to Streatham. She showed talent at an early age and took lessons in the junior department of the Royal College of Music beginning on her tenth birthday. She attended the College with scholarships for violin and piano. As part of their training, all of the students performed in the children's theatre. She formally began composition studies at the RCMJD with Stanley Drummond Wolff in 1937, continued the next year with Leslie Fly, and the next two with Percy Buck. She continued at the Royal College for senior-level studies, where her composition teacher was Herbert Howells. She dropped the study of violin after the death of her instructor, W.H. Reed, at the end of the first year. She also studied mime, drama, and singing. Dring's love of theatre and music co-mingled happily; many of her earliest professional creations were for the stage, radio, and television. In 1947 she married Roger Lord who served as Principal Oboist with London Symphony Orchestra for thirty years. She composed several works for Roger, including the highly regarded Dances for solo oboe. Soon after her marriage, her first pieces were published with Lengnick and with Oxford (1948). The Lords had one son in 1950. Dring died in 1977 of a cerebral hemorrhage. Despite some confusion about her final resting place, Dring's tombstone was recently uncovered (in situ) at Lambeth Cemetery in Streatham. Both Roger and their son, Jeremy, died in 2014. Roger died at age 90 and Jeremy died of ALS. All facts are confirmed by family members. A book, Madeleine Dring: Her Music, Her Life, by Ro Hancock-Child, was published in 2000 (2nd edition 2009), and included cartoon illustrations from Dring's own notebooks interpreted by Ro Hancock-Child. The biography was partially funded by Dring's husband, Roger Lord, in order to disseminate information about his late wife's compositions.Barnett (2000) Several articles, compact disc recordings, and inclusions of Dring's biographical information in books about composers in the last decade have secured her name a place in the modern lexicon. Music Dring's favourite composer in her youth was Rachmaninov and she owned much piano and vocal sheet music by Rachmaninov, which is now in the possession of Ro Hancock-Child. Dring studied with Herbert Howells but her own work shows no debt to his musical style. Occasionally she was taught by Ralph Vaughan Williams but again there is little obvious influence, and her music does not reflect the English folk song tradition. She looked further afield. Dring particularly enjoyed (and imitated) the mannerisms of Poulenc, for instance in the accompaniment to her song I Feed A Flame. As observed by Ro Hancock-Child, Dring preferred jazzy idioms, Gershwin, Cole Porter and the sunny style of Arthur Benjamin. Having heard the calypso in London, she responded with her own Caribbean Dance and West Indian Dance, for piano. Dring deliberately did not repeat her musical material from piece to piece, always finding a fresh approach to harmony and rhythm. If her vocal music has ever been compared to Roger Quilter (possibly because of similar text choices) it is a mistaken comparison. Quilter was solidly Victorian in outlook, and his songs are deeply melodic and contrapuntal. By contrast, Dring looked to the future, and thrived on novelty and surprise, hoping that what she wrote might gently shock or make you smile. Her vocal melodies arise from the underlying harmonies and can be difficult to pitch: the chords come first, as Ro Hancock- Child observes. Dring wrote most of her songs for her own use: she had a high quality soprano voice with a wide range, and perfect pitch. Several informal and informative recordings exist of Dring singing and playing her own compositions. Dring's cabaret songs and West End Revue material sometimes featured her own lyrics and are full of clever writing, both musically and textually. They have recently been given recordings and published. Dring chose not to compose large-scale works, therefore most of her output was in shorter forms. She wrote pieces for solo piano, piano duets, songs with piano, and some chamber music, including pieces for piano duo, flute, oboe, harmonica, recorder, and clarinet, a small number of which are pedagogical works. Her works for television and radio are all within a 45-minute time frame or shorter. She completed a one-act opera, Cupboard Love (published in 2017) with her friend D.F. Aitken (never performed during her lifetime, but received its stage premiere in the United States in April 2018 and its European premiere in Scotland in June 2019). A dance drama entitled The Fair Queen of Wu which was broadcast on BBC Television in 1951. The ballet called for a full company of soloists who were off camera. She was commissioned to write music for \\"The Real Princess,\\" a ballet and for several stage plays in London given from 1946 to 1971. She often collaborated with Felicity Gray, choreographer, and D.F. Aitken, librettist. Simon William Lord, Dring's grandson, used some of her compositions for tracks on his solo 'Lord Skywave' album. Works Dring rarely provided dates for her compositions; many dates come from Alistair Fisher's treatise on her songs. Publication dates have been provided, many of which are posthumously published by her husband, Roger Lord. Some dates have more recently been re-established using dates of first performances and other information as confirmed in Dring's personal papers as well as in archival newspaper reviews. In 2018 three volumes of songs were engraved and published as well as four volumes of cabaret and musical revue numbers. Duets and ensembles were also published.

In the late 1980s, he was a fan of the classic industrial bands like Skinny Puppy, Front 242 and Nitzer Ebb. Driven by the innovative sound of industrial music, Kozlov began to experiment with analogue synthesizers. In 1992, he recorded his first tracks on a Studio ‚ÄúTandem‚Äù, which recorded mainly pop musicians, but had very enthusiastic sound engineers. Together they developed the sound of Kozlov's project Inner Resonance Voice. In 1994, In‚ÄôR‚ÄôVoice became hugely popular on Moscow's main radio station Maximum and in nightclubs. A year later he received an award for innovations in music from the Ministry of Culture of Russia. In 1996, Kozlov visited London, and attained early trance music events held by Transient Records (Otherworld Party) and by the label Return To The Source in a Fridge Club and the party label ‚ÄúPagan‚Äù by Tsuoshi Suzuki (Matsury Productions). He recorded collaboration tracks with Tim Healey and Seb Taylor. Kozlov helped to organise concerts in Moscow for the leading trance projects including Shakta, Slide, Quirk, DJ's Baraka, John Phantasm, Mike McGuire (Juno Reactor), and Chris Organic. In 1999, Kozlov relocated to London, and played alongside James Monro, Blue Planet Corporation, Tim Schuldt, Infected Mushroom, Bumbling Loons, Shakta, Hux Flux and many more. The first full album on Optica Records In‚ÄôR‚ÄôVoice, Resonance Metaphizix, was mastered at the Abbey Road Studios in London. After 2004, Kozlov began to experiment with other styles of music, and recorded ‚ÄúDigital Shamanism‚Äù on London's Optica Records, ‚ÄúThe Scent of Russian Dreams‚Äù on Sphere Records and ‚ÄúDo You Sea What I See‚Äù on System Recordings in the US. In 2008, Kozlov founded his own multigenre EDM record label, Kissthesound Records (kissthesound.com), and in 2013 Tech-House label Axiomatic Records (axiomatic-records.com), aiming to release young talented musicians from Russia and Europe producing different trends of music. Constantly widening his collection of his records, Kozlov has released his music under many project names such as Den Kozlov, Peace Data, Decay Axiomatic, Emotion Code, Karmahacker, Technokitsch, Dive Craft, Shagging Harmonies, T.E.C.H.O., Record Needle Injection, X-Television, Pixelliadians, Psy-Phi Generation, Babnick Enemy, Krolex, S.H.L.I., X-Alt Project, Slake Philter, Overtone Epidemic, Slick Tweak, Levitating Cat, Love In Decay, Eastern Promises, See You Later Oscillator, and Moot.

Sand mandala displaying its materials Sand mandala (; ) is a Tibetan Buddhist tradition involving the creation and destruction of mandalas made from coloured sand. A sand mandala is ritualistically dismantled once it has been completed and its accompanying ceremonies and viewing are finished to symbolize the Buddhist doctrinal belief in the transitory nature of material life. Materials and construction Historically, the mandala was not created with natural, dyed sand, but granules of crushed coloured stone. In modern times, plain white stones are ground down and dyed with opaque inks to achieve the same effect. The monks use a special, extremely dense sand in order to limit interference by things like wind or sneezes. Before laying down the sand, the monks assigned to the project will draw the geometric measurements associated with the mandala. The sand granules are then applied using small tubes, funnels, and scrapers, called chak-pur, until the desired pattern over- top is achieved. Sand mandalas traditionally take several weeks to build due to the large amount of work involved in laying down the sand in such intricate detail. It is common that a team of monks will work together on the project, creating one section of the diagram at a time, working from the centre outwards. Themes The Kalachakra Mandala for instance, contains 722 deities portrayed within the complex structure and geometry of the mandala itself. Other smaller mandalas, like the one attributed to Vajrabhairava contain significantly fewer deities and require less geometry, but still take several days to complete. Like all mandalas, these are meant as two-dimensional representations of what is supposed to be a three-dimensional environment. Various buildings have been suggested to be three-dimensional mandalas such as: Borobodur in Java, Indonesia, and the Bayon in Siem Reap, Cambodia, although no academic consensus on either has yet been reached. Many sand mandala contain a specific outer locality which is clearly identified as a charnel ground. The colours for the painting are usually made with naturally coloured sand, crushed gypsum (white), yellow ochre, red sandstone, charcoal, and a mixture of charcoal and gypsum (blue). Mixing red and black can make brown, red and white make pink. Other colouring agents include corn meal, flower pollen, or powdered roots and bark. Ritual destruction The destruction of a sand mandala is also highly ceremonial. Even the deity syllables are removed in a specific order along with the rest of the geometry until at last the mandala has been dismantled to show impermanence. The sand is collected in a jar which is then wrapped in silk and transported to a river (or any place with moving water), where it is released back into nature to spread the holy blessings of the sand mandala.

The season officially began on June 15, 1948, and lasted until November 15, 1948. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. There were 10 tropical cyclones; six storms attained hurricane status, and four storms intensified into major hurricanes, which are Category 3 or higher on the modern-day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. Operationally, it was believed that a weak tropical disturbance formed over the southeast Bahamas in May and moved northwest into the Georgia coast near Savannah. This system was later excluded from HURDAT. The seventh tropical cyclone was not operationally considered a tropical cyclone, but was later added to HURDAT. The sixth and eighth systems, designated as Dog and Easy by the Air Weather Service in real time, respectively, were the most intense tropical cyclones of the season, peaking as a Category 4 hurricane with a minimum barometric pressure of . The former caused eight deaths and $400,000 (1948 USD) in damage after bringing strong winds, rough seas, and heavy rainfall to Bermuda and Atlantic Canada. In Cuba and Florida, the eighth hurricane left 13 fatalities and at least $14 million in damage. The ninth hurricane, assigned the name Fox by the Air Weather Service, brought similar impact to Cuba and Florida about two weeks later. In May, the first tropical cyclone killed 80 people from flooding in the Dominican Republic. Collectively, the storms of this season left around $28.8 million in damage and 112 fatalities.

However, tropical cyclogenesis began on April 15, about two months before the official start of the season. There was a total of ten tropical storms, six of which strengthened into hurricanes. Further, four of the six hurricanes deepened into major hurricanes, which are Category 3 or higher on Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. Of the nine tropical disturbances detected operationally, five struck the United States with winds of or greater, while the other tropical systems affected islands, remained over the open ocean, or affected the country with winds below tropical storm intensity. Three hurricanes made landfall in the United States, while the three other storms with winds of at least largely remained at sea. Collectively, the storms of this season left around $28.8 million in damage and 112 fatalities.  * The strongest storms of the season attained Category 4 intensity; two of the major hurricanes formed in the western Caribbean Sea and affected the United States in late September and October. A minimal hurricane struck southern Louisiana on September 4, causing tides of and winds of in New Orleans. A minimal tropical storm made landfall near Destin in July. An intense hurricane attained Category 4 strength and produced extensive damage and 100 mph (160 km/) wind gusts on Bermuda in mid-September. A Category 4 hurricane struck the Florida Keys and the Everglades in September, resulting in $12 million of damages in the state. After the passage of one week, another hurricane affected the region as a Category 2 storm, after crossing Cuba with winds of 125 mph (200 km/h). Only three direct fatalities occurred in the United States, largely because of improved evacuations and adherence to warnings and advisories. The season's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 95. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39 mph (63 km/h), which is tropical storm strength. Systems=Tropical Storm One A broad area of low pressure in the central Caribbean Sea developed into a tropical depression early on May 22\\\\. The circulation moved northward, and it made landfall in southwest Haiti around 1200 UTC with winds of . Over the next day, the system crossed Hispaniola and the Turks and Caicos Islands with winds unchanged. Turning to the northeast, it strengthened into a tropical storm at 1200 UTC on May 24 while over the southwest Atlantic. Shortly afterward, the tropical cyclone turned to the north. On May 25, the storm's forward motion slowed to a crawl; within a few hours, the storm attained its estimated peak intensity of , as reported by reconnaissance aircraft, though no ships reported gale-force winds. The next day, the cyclone started to weaken, and on May 27, the system began to accelerate northward. The system diminished to a tropical depression on May 29 shortly prior to dissipation. The tropical system brought heavy precipitation to Hispaniola, and widespread flooding took place across the region. In the Dominican Republic, the capital city of Santo Domingo (then known as Ciudad Trujillo) was impacted significantly, where of rain fell in 24 hours. More than 20 bridges were swept away, isolating the city from the rest of the country. Several people went missing in the floodwaters and it is estimated that 80 people died. The storm ranks as the deadliest Atlantic tropical cyclone to form in the off-season. Tropical Storm Two After nearly two months of inactivity, an area of disturbed weather developed in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The area organized into a tropical depression over the north-central Gulf of Mexico on July 7\\\\. The depression strengthened slightly and became a weak tropical storm early on July 9, when it peaked with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 km/h). Several hours later, the system made landfall east of Pensacola, Florida, but quickly weakened to a depression as it moved inland. The remnants moved north through southeastern Alabama on July 10, and the circulation dissipated over southern Tennessee on July 11\\\\. The system produced minimal effects along the Florida Panhandle. Winds of were measured at Pensacola during the passage of a thunderstorm, and the tropical cyclone caused heavy precipitation over northern Florida, southern Alabama, and southern Georgia. Overall damage was minimal. Hurricane Three (Able) A strong tropical storm, named Able by the Air Weather Service in real time, was first identified on August 26 about 300 mi (485 km) northeast of Saint John, as ship reports indicated winds of Force 9. However, it is likely that Able formed much farther east, possibly as a Cape Verde-type hurricane. The tropical cyclone quickly intensified to a hurricane, and it continued to steadily progress northwest. The storm strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane on August 27, and while turning west-northwestward it continued to intensify. The cyclone peaked as a 120 mph (195 km/h) Category 3 hurricane by 1800 UTC on August 28, which was measured by a reconnaissance aircraft flight. Its forward motion slowed on August 29, and it began to weaken as it turned to the north on August 30\\\\. The tropical system weakened to a minimal hurricane, and it accelerated to the northeast on August 31\\\\. The storm soon became extratropical before striking southern Newfoundland on September 2\\\\. Over the next several days, the system slowly weakened, and its remnants turned east before dissipating south of southern Iceland on September 5\\\\. In anticipation of the storm, the U.S. Weather Bureau posted hurricane warnings from Wilmington to Cape Hatteras. On August 30, as the tropical cyclone began to turn to the north, the center was expected to pass over or near Cape Hatteras. High tides occurred along the North Carolina coastline, which prompted evacuations and precautions in the area. The remnants of the storm brought strong winds to Atlantic Canada. In Nova Scotia, the storm severely disrupted electricity and communications between Halifax and Sydney. At the latter, many trees were uprooted, with several falling on streets and cars. In Newfoundland, a wind gust as strong as was observed. The community of Port au Port was hard hit. Among the structures damaged included a store, which lost its roof, and a church, which the storm completely destroyed. Port au Port alone suffered about $200,000 (1948 CAD) in damage. Along the shore, a number of pleasure crafts were wrecked. Some other structures, trees, and boats were impacted or destroyed throughout the province. The communities along the south coast of Newfoundland collectively experienced about $400,000 (1948 CAD) in damage. Overall, the storm left over $989,000 (1948 CAD) in damage in Canada. Tropical Storm Four (Baker) On August 30, a tropical storm named Baker by the Air Weather Service in real time, was first detected about 275 mi (445 km) east of Barbados, by a ship that reported high easterly seas and winds of Force 10. Upon being initially observed, Baker was already at its peak maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). The small system moved rapidly westward and slowly weakened to a marginal tropical cyclone on August 31. On the morning of September 1, Baker passed between Saint Lucia and Martinique, when a reconnaissance aircraft mission reported a minimum pressure of 1007 mbar (29.73 inHg). Subsequent missions failed to detect a center of circulation, and the tropical cyclone quickly degenerated to a tropical depression. Baker dissipated over the eastern Caribbean Sea on September 1\\\\. The storm brought heavy rainfall to several eastern Caribbean islands, though most of it was beneficial. On Puerto Rico, water supplies and crops were replenished. Hurricane Five (Charlie) An area of disturbed weather organized into a tropical storm - named Charlie by the Air Weather Service in real time - on September 1 over the western Gulf of Mexico. On the morning of September 2, the poorly defined center moved northeast, and Charlie gradually intensified. It attained hurricane intensity on September 3 and then slowly accelerated toward the upper Gulf Coast. It rapidly reached its peak intensity of , and it crossed the coastline west of Golden Meadow, Louisiana, on September 4\\\\. The center moved inland over Orleans Parish, and the weakening tropical cyclone diminished to a strong tropical storm prior to moving over southern Mississippi. Charlie continued to weaken and fell to tropical depression intensity on September 5\\\\. The remnants turned to the north, and the circulation dissipated over northwestern Indiana on September 6. On September 4, the U.S. Weather Bureau advised residents that the storm was expected to strike land between Morgan City and Grand Isle around midnight, as its forward motion had increased to . The weather service also noted that abnormally high tides were expected from the Mississippi River to Pensacola, as the center was predicted to pass east of New Orleans and move to the west of Biloxi shortly before dawn. About 1,000 people left their homes in Terrebonne Parish and took shelter in a courthouse and school buildings in Houma. As winds increased, city officials in New Orleans ordered 2,000 people to evacuate from a wartime housing project into an auditorium for shelter. Offshore, oil drilling platforms and equipment were destroyed by high seas near Grand Isle. The island itself was cut off from the mainland after inundated roadways. Throughout southeastern Louisiana, beans were destroyed north of Lake Pontchartrain, while sugar cane and corn were flattened, especially in Lafourche, Jefferson, St. Charles, and Terrebonne parishes. Pecan and tung nut crops also suffered damage in southeastern Mississippi. The hurricane produced gusts of at Moisant Airport, and tides ranged from along the coast from Mississippi to the Florida Panhandle. The maximum tide reached in New Orleans, and winds caused damage to small boats, trees, and power and communication lines. The remnants of the hurricane brought rainfall far inland, including of precipitation observed in Detroit, Michigan. Total damage in the United States reached $900,000. Hurricane Six (Dog) A tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa on September 3 and was designated as Tropical Storm Dog by the Air Weather Service in real time on the following day. The cyclone tracked a general westward path for much of its initial stages as it gradually intensified, reaching tropical storm intensity shortly after development and then hurricane intensity a day later. After reaching a longitude roughly equal to that of the Lesser Antilles, Dog began to curve northward on a parabolic track, bringing it near Bermuda at peak intensity as a Category 4 hurricane on September 13\\\\. The hurricane then began to accelerate northeastward and weaken. The waning Dog grazed Cape Race, Newfoundland, before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on September 15; these remnants persisted for an additional day. Although the storm never making landfall, Dog disrupted numerous shipping lanes and inflicted damage on Bermuda and Newfoundland. In the former, the hurricane brought winds in excess of 100 mph (160 km/h), downing power lines and trees. Property damage also resulted from the strong winds, totaling about $400,000. After passing west of Bermuda, the tropical cyclone tracked across numerous shipping lanes. Two ships, the Leicester and Gaspar, encountered the hurricane and became stricken in open waters. Though most people were rescued from both ships, six people perished on the former while one died on the latter. Beginning on September 15, the hurricane tracked east of Newfoundland, producing heavy rainfall on land. The precipitation flooded roads and caused streams to overflow, inundating additional areas. On the island, one person were killed. Overall, the hurricane caused eight fatalities. Tropical Storm Seven Operationally, this storm was not considered a tropical cyclone. Late on September 7, an extratropical system transitioned into a tropical storm about 355 mi (570 km) northeast of Bermuda. The storm curved northwestward and peaked with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . After turning northward and then northeastward, the storm began losing tropical characteristics and reverted to an extratropical cyclone on September 10 while situated about 215 mi (345 km) southwest of Sable Island, Nova Scotia. The remnants continued northeastward until dissipating just offshore Newfoundland. Hurricane Eight (Easy) The Florida Hurricane of 1948 The eighth storm, designated as Tropical Storm Easy by the Air Weather Service in real time, developed from a tropical wave over the Caribbean Sea on September 18. Early the next day, Easy strengthened into a hurricane while moving westward. Thereafter, it curved northwestward and continued to deepen. By September 20, the system turned northward and later that day made landfall along the Zapata Peninsula of Cuba as a Category 3 hurricane on the modern day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. Another landfall occurred in Cuba early the next day to the south of G√ºines. Severe destruction was reported on the island, with winds up to 90 mph (140 km/h) observed in Havana. Over 700 buildings were destroyed. Ten deaths occurred and damage totaled at least $2 million, while other sources estimate \\"several million dollars.\\" After emerging into the Straits of Florida on September 21, Easy resumed intensification, before striking near Boca Chica Key, Florida, with winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). By early on September 22, the system peaked as a Category 4 hurricane with sustained winds of 130 mph (215 km/h). Shortly thereafter, another landfall occurred near Chokoloskee at the same intensity. Severe damage was reported in the state due to strong winds. The storm was considered the worst in Key West since 1919. Throughout the state, 1,200 homes were severely damaged or destroyed, while 40 businesses were demolished and 237 suffered impact. There were three deaths and about $12 million in damage, over half of which was inflicted on crops. The storm rapidly weakened while crossing the state and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean as only a Category 1 hurricane later on September 22\\\\. Slight fluctuations in intensity occurred before the hurricane became extratropical early on September 24, while located northwest of Bermuda. The remnants accelerated to the east-northeastward and continued to weaken, before dissipating hundreds of miles east of Newfoundland on September 26. Late September tropical depression On September 25, a westward moving tropical wave near the Lesser Antilles began appearing in historical weather map. A reconnaissance aircraft flight into the system when it was over the central Caribbean Sea indicated wind gusts up to , but no circulation. During a separate fight on September 29, it was noted that, \\"[a] complete search of area shows well-organized circle of storm but open to west and northwest\\". Although no circulation was detected, westerly winds were reported, making it likely that a tropical depression developed that day over the western Caribbean. Subsequently, the depression moved over the northern Yucat√°n Peninsula, which may have disrupted the poorly-defined circulation. By October 1, the system entered the Gulf of Mexico, where it began degenerating into an open trough on October 3\\\\. Cold air and the development of Hurricane Fox in the western Caribbean prevented re-generation. The remnants continued northeastward into North Florida and deepened while producing strong gales along the coasts of North Carolina and Virginia. It is possible that the remnants lasted until October 8, when it was absorbed by Fox. Hurricane Nine (Fox) The Miami Hurricane of 1948 On October 3, a tropical depression developed over the northwestern Caribbean Sea. The storm intensified into a tropical storm, designated as Tropical Storm Fox by the Air Weather Service in real time, early on October 4\\\\. Several hours later, the storm became a hurricane. Fox then significantly deepened, peaking as a Category 3 intensity with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) early on October 5\\\\. Around that time, Fox made landfall in eastern Pinar del R√≠o Province of Cuba. Fox crossed the island and emerged into the Straits of Florida a few hours later. Late on October 5, the hurricane made landfall on Bahia Honda Key, Florida, with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) and near Flamingo about two hours later. Fox emerged into the Atlantic Ocean near Fort Lauderdale early on October 6\\\\. The storm moved northeastward and later curved to the east-northeast. Late on October 7, Fox made landfall on Bermuda with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h). Fox weakened over the next several days and later executed a large cyclonic loop. By October 16, it became extratropical while well east-southeast of Newfoundland. In Cuba, homes and cattle were swept away by flash flooding. Eleven deaths and about 300 injuries were attributed to the tropical cyclone. Damage in the country reached about $6 million. The storm brought strong winds to Florida, with a sustained wind speed of at Naval Air Station Key West. Heavy rainfall exceeding in Miami and three tornadoes also contributed to the damage in South Florida. Throughout the state, 674 homes were severely damaged or destroyed, while 45 other buildings were demolished. Overall, damage in Florida reached $5.5 million and there were no deaths, but 36 injuries, none of which were serious. In Bermuda, buildings were unroofed and the sides of some structures were knocked down. Electrical light wires and telephone lines were toppled across the island. Damage totaled over $1 million. Hurricane Ten (George) A tropical storm developed about midway between Bermuda and Puerto Rico on November 8\\\\. Designated as George by the Air Weather Service in real time, the storm moved quickly west-northwestward. Early on November 10, George is believed to have reached hurricane intensity after reconnaissance aircraft flights recorded a small area of winds ranging from . Peaking as a Category 1 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of , George then curved north-northwestward. Later that day, the hurricane began to become disorganized and weakened to a tropical storm. Early on November 11, George degenerated into an area of disturbed weather while located about 195 mi (315 km) east of Virginia Beach, Virginia. As the hurricane threatened the coast of North Carolina on November 10, hurricane warnings were issued between Cape Lookout and Cape Hatteras. Other systems In addition to the ten systems that became a tropical storm and the other tropical depression, there were a few tropical cyclones that failed to strengthen beyond tropical depression intensity. A weak broad low pressure area formerly associated with a trough developed into a tropical depression well northeast of the Lesser Antilles on April 15\\\\. A barometric pressure of was observed that day. The depression moved northward and then became stationary by April 17, before degenerating into a trough on the next day. The next tropical depression developed from a northward moving tropical wave over the eastern Gulf of Mexico on July 31\\\\. Although the depression continued northward, it cannot be determined if the system made landfall in the Florida Panhandle before dissipating on August 2\\\\. Tampa recorded a 5-minute sustained wind speed of on July 31\\\\. By August 13, another tropical depression formed from area of disturbed weather well offshore the Mid-Atlantic. The system moved rapidly northeastward and became extratropical early on August 14\\\\. It may have been a tropical storm, based on barometric pressure of observed by a ship shortly after extratropical transition. On September 16, a trough of low pressure developed into a tropical depression over the western Gulf of Mexico. Unfavorable conditions caused the depression to dissipated by the following day.

Natural salt pans are geological formations that are also created by water evaporating and leaving behind salts. Some salt evaporation ponds are only slightly modified from their natural version, such as the ponds on Great Inagua in the Bahamas, or the ponds in Jasiira, a few kilometres south of Mogadishu, where seawater is trapped and left to evaporate in the sun. The seawater or brine is fed into large ponds and water is drawn out through natural evaporation which allows the salt to be subsequently harvested. The ponds also provide a productive resting and feeding ground for many species of waterbirds, which may include endangered species.Athearn, Nicole D.; Takekawa, John Y.; and Shinn, Joel M. (2009) Avian response to early tidal salt marsh restoration at former commercial salt evaporation ponds in San Francisco Bay, California, USA, Natural Resources and Environmental Issues: Vol. 15, Article 14. The ponds are commonly separated by levees. Salt evaporation ponds may also be called salterns, salt works or salt pans.  Algae and color  San Francisco Bay salt ponds Due to variable algal concentrations, vivid colors (from pale green to bright red) are created in the evaporation ponds. The color indicates the salinity of the ponds. Microorganisms change their hues as the salinity of the pond increases. In low- to mid-salinity ponds, green algae such as Dunaliella salina are predominant, although these algae can also take on an orange hue. In middle- to high-salinity ponds, Halobacteria, which is actually a group of halophilic Archaea (sometimes called Haloarchaea), shift the colour to pink, red and orange. Other bacteria such as Stichococcus also contribute tints.  Examples  Notable salt ponds include: * The Salterns of Gu√©rande, in Loire-Atlantique, France. The salt produced in the salterns are a protected geographical indication in Europe. * The C√°huil salt ponds, in the O'Higgins Region, Chile. * The Salineras de Maras, Peru, in the Cusco Region. * The saltworks of Alc√°cer do Sal, Comporta, and Castro Marim in Portugal * The El Caracol solar evaporator, on the outskirts of Mexico City, Mexico. * The Seƒçovlje and Strunjan salt ponds on the northern edge of the Adriatic Sea in Slovenia. * The San Francisco Bay salt ponds in the United States, formerly operated by Cargill,Napa Salt Pond Complex , The Bay InstituteSalt ponds, South San Francisco Bay, NASA Earth Observatory including Charleston Slough.

In time the sea water evaporated, leaving the salt behind on the post, where it was easier to harvest.  Production  Salt pans are shallow open, often metal, pans used to evaporate brine. They are usually found close to the source of the salt. For example, pans used in the solar evaporation of salt from sea water are usually found on the coast, while those used to extract salt from solution-mined brine will be found near to the brine shaft. In this case, extra heat is often provided by lighting fires underneath. Gallery File:2014 Cape Verde. Sal.

They can be issued on a fixed or floating coupon basis. In opposite to conventional bonds, these can be offered continuously through various brokers, instead of issuing the full amount at once. Also, in contrast to conventional bonds market, the agent (typically investment bank) in MTM market is not obliged to underwrite the notes for the issuer and the agent is thus not guaranteed funds. Floating rate medium-term notes can be as simple as paying the holder a coupon linked to Euribor +/- basis points or can be more complex structured notes linked, for example, to swap rates, treasuries, indices, etc. The amount of the issues usually ranges from $100 million to $1 billion. In the recent years, MTNs have become major source of financing in international financial markets, both in US and EU.  Issuance  MTNs can be issued with a fixed maturity date (noncallable) or can be issued with embedded call or put options and triggers where the notes will redeem early based on certain parameters. MTNs are most commonly issued as senior, noncallable unsecured debt of investment grade credit rated entities which have fixed rates. MTNs offer more flexibility to the issuer and investor both in terms of structure and documentation. Issuance of MTNs to investors based in the US (under the SEC rule 415) requires a separate US MTN program approved by the SEC (or relying on some exemption from registration). When they are issued to investors outside the US, they are called \\"Euro Medium Term Notes\\" (EMTN). These can allow both investors and issuers to enter foreign markets easily. In that case, the requirements are similar. Emissions must have a standardized document, called program, which can be used across all issues and the notes are (mainly) of maturity shorter than 5 years. Similarly to Euro-bonds, EMTNs are not subject to national regulations, such as registration requirements. Even though the EMTNs can be traded throughout the world, most offerings are distributed in London The process starts with company files an shelf registration with the SEC, set up the prospectus and establishes the MTM program. Once this is done, it distributes the notes to the market, usually through investment banks, acting as selling agents, arranging the interest rates and maturities. When investors shows interest, the issuer is contacted and the deal is finalized and confirmed.  Options  When issuing the MTN, the issuer can include call or put option in the program. With call options, the debtor have a right to repay the principal earlier than at its maturity. In case of decrease of the market interest rates the businesses can repay the old notes and issue new ones at the lower rates. As this represents significant increase in risk for the investors, it may result in higher interest rates for these notes. On the other hand, put options guarantees investors possibility to redeem the principal before the maturity (at some specific point of time), which leads to lower interest rates.  Offering size  The offering size plays a significant role in cost differentiating between MTNs and standard corporate bonds. For large issues, the interest and underwriting costs for issuer may be lower for corporate bonds, due to economies of scale in underwriting and its greater liquidity. However, for smaller sizes, this liquidity premium would be insignificant and the economies of scale would have opposite effect. Moreover, the MTN distribution process allows the issuer price discriminate, by splitting the desired amount into smaller issues and negotiate a separate interest rates and maturities for each issue. This may lead to lower financing costs than in case of raising the whole amount at one interest rate. This, together with the possibility of continuous offering, may play a significant role in choosing, which instrument to use for financing.  Advantages  * The rates of return on MTNs are usually higher than on other short-term investments. * These notes are custom defined case by case and can be tailored to both issuers and investors needs (within legal requirements). * For investors, it may serve as a compromise investment opportunity between short-term investments and bonds with long maturities. * Availability to raise the funds non-publicly.  Disadvantages  * Higher costs of servicing * Due to strict issuance documentation requirements, issuers may prefer issuing public bonds instead.  History  MTNs were first put into use in 1970s, when the General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC) needed to issue debt with maturity matching to the car loans provided to dealerships and consumers. The commercial papers were not suitable, as their maturities cannot exceed 270 days and the underwriting costs of bond offering were too high for short maturities to be practical. GMAC thus began to sell their notes directly to investors. Because of illiquidity of the secondary market and securities regulations, the market remained relatively quiet until 1980s. Then, in 1981, investment banks stepped in by providing assistance in the process of issuance and liquidity to the market and one year later, the SEC adopted its rule 415, which permitted delayed or continuous issuance of so-called shelf registered corporate securities, enabling issuers to register securities that may be sold for two years after the effective date of the registration without the need for approval for each individual offering. Because of these changes, investors also become more aware of this instruments and were willing to add it to their portfolios. This improved liquidity and helped the growth of the MTM market. In the beginnings, most of the issues were fixed rate, noncallable and unsecured debt of maturity shorter than 5 years. Throughout the years, due to specific needs of investors and businesses, more flexible forms, like notes with options or floating rates were invented. This also helped spread of its use to Euro markets.

It was originally published as Symphony No. 2. It is highly regarded by critics and musicologists; Tovey stated that \\"along with the four Brahms symphonies and Schubert's Ninth, it is among the greatest and purest examples in this art-form since Beethoven\\".Tovey 1936, Dvo≈ô√°k Symphony No.2 (No.7) Compositional structure The work, approximately 40 minutes in length, is scored for an orchestra of 2 flutes (2nd doubling piccolo in the 3rd movement), 2 oboes, 2 clarinets (in A and B), 2 bassoons, 4 horns (in D and F), 2 trumpets (in C, D, and F), 3 trombones, timpani and strings. Composition history Dvo≈ô√°k's work on the symphony began on 13 December 1884. Dvo≈ô√°k had heard and admired Johannes Brahms' new Symphony No. 3, and this prompted him to think of writing of a new symphony himself. So it was fortuitous that in that same year the London Philharmonic Society invited him to write a new symphony and elected him as an honorary member. A month later, after his daily walk to Prague railway station, he said \\"the first subject of my new symphony flashed in to my mind on the arrival of the festive train bringing our countrymen from Pest\\". The Czechs were in fact coming to the National Theatre in Prague, where there was to be a musical evening to support the political struggles of the Czech nation. He resolved that his new symphony would reflect this struggle. In doing so the symphony would also reveal something of his personal struggle in reconciling his simple and peaceful countryman's feelings with his intense patriotism and his wish to see the Czech nation flourish. He completed a sketch of the first movement in five days, and he wrote to one of his friends: \\"I am now busy with this symphony for London, and wherever I go I can think of nothing else. God grant that this Czech music will move the world!!\\" He finished his sketch of the slow movement ten days later. He added a footnote \\"From the sad years\\". This refers to the recent death of his mother, and probably also to the previous death of his eldest child, and these events were in his mind especially in this movement. However, there is also a broader horizon‚Äîhe wrote to a friend \\"What is in my mind is Love, God, and my Fatherland.\\" The movement starts with intense calm and peace, but also includes turmoil and unsettled weather. He told his publisher that \\"there is not one superfluous note\\". Donald Tovey and Robert Layton have both observed that the second movement, like the furiant of Symphony No. 6, shows contact with Czech sources, although Michael Beckerman suggests that the relationship \\"seems overpowered by the formal mastery of Dvo≈ô√°k's development of the ideas.\\"Beckerman 2012, p. 42 In the next month or so Dvo≈ô√°k completed the sketches of the third and fourth movements. He later said that the 4th movement includes a suggestion of the capacity of the Czech people to display stubborn resistance to political oppressors. In 1885 it received its brilliantly successful first performance at St James's Hall in London, with Dvo≈ô√°k himself conducting. Despite the success of the symphony, the publication of the work was a nightmare. Dvo≈ô√°k's contracted German publisher, Fritz Simrock, seemed to go out of his way to make difficulties and to irritate him. First, he said he could not consider publishing it until a piano duet arrangement was available. Simrock then flatly refused to print his Czech name, Anton√≠n, on the cover‚Äîthe publisher insisted that it be Anton, and that the title page be in German only. Finally, he was told that the dedication to the London Philharmonic Society would have to be omitted. During all of these prolonged arguments, Dvo≈ô√°k asked Simrock for an advance: \\"I have a lot of expense with my garden, and my potato crop isn't very good\\". Eventually, Simrock offered only 3,000 marks for the symphony, which was a low value for such a major work. Dvo≈ô√°k replied that other publishers would readily pay twice as much. After further argument, Simrock grudgingly paid the 6,000 marks. Evaluation Symphony No. 7, together with No. 8 in G major and No. 9 in E minor, represent Dvo≈ô√°k at his best, and they each reveal a somewhat different aspect of his personality. No. 7 is the most ambitious in structure, and the most consciously international in its message. The Dvo≈ô√°k specialist John Clapham writes that \\"without doubt\\" the No. 7 \\"must surely be Dvo≈ô√°k's greatest symphony,\\"Clapham 1979, p. 74 although elsewhere he writes that the No. 9 is the most popular worldwide.Clapham 1979, pp. 132‚Äì133 As Symphony No. 9 is so often played, Clapham in effect recommends that conductors perform, and listeners hear, No. 7 as well. Bernard Shore stated \\"There is no doubt that the seventh in D minor is the finest of the series [of Dvo≈ô√°k symphonies]\\"Shore 1949, p. 144 and Tovey implicitly agreesTovey 1936, Dvo≈ô√°k Symphony No.2 (No.7).

Name The Spanish name onza derives from the Latin lynx, lyncis, and is equivalent to the English word \\"ounce\\", originally applied to the lynx but now more commonly to the snow leopard (Uncia uncia).Oxford English Dictionary, Oxford University Press. 1933: Ounce There are old texts written by Spanish conquistadors about the onza, but they might refer to the jaguarundi, which is known as onza in many Mexican states. On√ßa is the Brazilian Portuguese word for jaguar, Panthera onca, where a spotted jaguar is known as on√ßa-pintada and a melanistic one as on√ßa-preta. These are real animals, occurring as far north as Mexico and possibly into the southwest of the United States. Also, a cat some call the \\"puma\\" Puma concolor is known most often as on√ßa-parda in some areas of Brazil (in others, it is known by the name that predates American cougar, su√ßuarana). Legends from history In one legend, after the Spaniards settled in Mexico, the animal was seen more often, and some unidentified group of people gave it the name onza. \\"It is not as timid as the [cougar]\\", wrote a Jesuit priest, Father Ignaz Pfefferkorn, in 1757, \\"and he who ventures to attack it must be well on his guard\\". Another missionary, Father Johann Baegert, wrote that an \\"onza dared to invade my neighbor's mission when I was visiting, and attacked a 14-year-old boy in broad daylight ... A few years ago another killed the strongest and most respected soldier\\" in the area. Twentieth century legends As a more recent series of anecdotes goes, in 1938, and again in 1986, an unknown number of cougar-like animals shot in Sinaloa were identified as \\"onza\\" by some unknown parties. One such story says that in 1938, hunters Dale and Clell Lee, with Indiana banker Joseph Shirk, shot what locals called an \\"onza\\" near La Silla Mountain in Sinaloa. Dale Lee was certain that the animal they shot was not a \\"puma\\". Although somewhat resembling what some think is a \\"puma\\" in coloration, its ears, legs, and body were longer, and it was built more lightly than a what they called a puma. The Mysterious Mr. Vega In this legend, the only viable specimen to have been examined was contributed by a rancher named Andres Murillo. In January 1986, he shot what he thought was a jaguar attacking him. Although there's no explanation of who proved it or how, the story goes on to say that it was proved not to be a jaguar. Murillo brought the specimen to a person identified only as \\"Vega\\", who was said to own a nearby ranch. There it was found to be a female weighing and measuring long without the -long tail. The story claims the animals were much like cougars but had lighter frames with longer, striped legs, longer ears, and a longer tail. It also claimed this particular cat had the appearance of a cougar with a very long, thin body and long, thin, doglike legs. Deer had been found in its stomach, supposedly indicating that it had eaten recently. The ranch owner referred to as Vega told Murillo that the specimen greatly resembled what he called an \\"onza\\" that his father had shot in the 1970s, the skull of which he still had. In another version of this legend, it wasn't Andres Murillo but two people named Rodriguez and Ricardo Zamora who were deer hunting at about 10:30 p.m. when they came across a large cat which seemed ready to charge. Fearing a jaguar attack, Rodriguez shot it. Seeing that it was not a jaguar or a puma, they took the body back to Rodriguez's ranch and Rodriguez contacted a Mr. Vega, who owned a nearby ranch and was an experienced hunter. This person known as Vega said that the cat was an onza and that it was nearly identical to one that his father had shot in the 1970s (the skull of the Vega animal had allegedly been preserved). Mr. Vega in turn contacted a Ricardo Urquijo, Jr., who suggested taking the animal's body to Mazatl√°n for examination. There, the cat was found to have a large wound on one of the rear legs which both Rodriguez and Mr. Vega believed to have been inflicted by a jaguar. It was also found to have been in good health with a fully functional reproductive system. In another version of the Mr. Vega legend, it was actually the farmer Andres Murillo who owned the ranch in the San Ignacio District of Sinaloa and who killed an animal similar to the one shot by Dale and Clell Lee. DNA testing confirmed that the Sinaloa specimen was a well-known subspecies of cougar and not an American cheetah or an unknown species. In another legend, it was claimed that researchers from Texas Tech University examined a frozen onza corpse in the 1990s but concluded that it was most likely a genetic variant of the cougar and not a distinct species. The story says that DNA testing had shown the specimen to be another known, but unmentioned, cat species with no significant difference between it and any other cat of that species. Identification legends In Mexico the term onza refers to more than one species. In some Mexican states the jaguarundi is also referred to as onza. Furthermore, there are also local legends claiming that there are two species of jaguarundi, one of which is usually called onza. Footnotes *Neil B. Carmony. Onza! The Hunt for a Legendary Cat.

This test is used when a person experiences very dry eyes or excessive watering of the eyes. It poses no risk to the subject. A negative (more than 10 mm of moisture on the filter paper in 5 minutes) test result is normal. Both eyes normally secrete the same amount of tears. It is named for Otto Schirmer. Test procedure Schirmer test = 0,00 in Sj√∂gren's syndrome The test works by the principle of capillary action, which allows the water in tears to travel along the length of a paper test strip in an identical fashion as a horizontal capillary tube. The rate of travel along the test strip is proportional to the rate of tear production. The patient is instructed to look upward, and the patient‚Äôs eyelid is pulled down. The bent end of the test strip is placed in the eye such that it rests between the palpebral conjunctiva of the lower eyelid and the bulbar conjunctiva of the eye. Schirmer's test uses paper strips inserted into the eye for several minutes to measure the production of tears. Both eyes are tested at the same time. Most often, this test consists of placing a small strip of filter paper inside the lower eyelid (inferior fornix). The eyes are closed for 5 minutes. The paper is then removed and the amount of moisture is measured. After five minutes, the patient is asked to open both eyes and look upward so the test strips may be removed. The Schirmer test score is determined by the length of the moistened area of the strips (using the scale packaged with the strips) The use of the anesthetic ensures that only basal tear secretion is being measured. A young person normally moistens 15 mm of each paper strip. Because hypolacrimation occurs with aging, 33% of normal elderly persons may wet only 10 mm in 5 minutes. Persons with Sj√∂gren's syndrome moisten less than 5 mm in 5 minutes. How to read results of the Schirmer's test: :1. Normal which is ‚â•10 mm wetting of the paper after 5 minutes. :2. Tear deficiency which is <5 mm wetting of the paper after 5 minutes. Alternatives to Schirmer's test Even though this test has been available for over a century, several clinical studies have shown that it does not properly identify a large group of patients with dry eyes. Newer and better tests of tear production and function are now emerging. * One test measures an iron-binding molecule called lactoferrin. The amount of this molecule appears to be closely related to tear production. Patients with low tear production and dry eyes have low levels of this molecule. This test may be especially valuable for patients with dry eyes since it can point to specific treatment strategies for dry eye. * The tears may also be examined for their content of lysozyme, an enzyme normally found in tears. * Another test involves fluorescein eye drops, which contain a dye that is placed in the eye. The dye should drain with the tears through the lacrimal duct into the nose within 2 minutes. If patients do not have enough tears to flush the dye into the nose, this time will be longer. A new test is also available to more accurately measure the flow of dye out of the eye. Eye dryness Dry eyes can occur from conditions such as: * Aging *Arthritis *Corneal ulcers and infections *Diabetes * Eye infections (for example conjunctivitis) *Secondary tearing deficiency associated with disorders such as - lymphoma, leukemia, GVHD (graft vs. host disease, after a transplant) * Sj√∂gren's syndrome * Triple A syndrome *Vitamin A deficiency * As a temporary or permanent side effect of LASER vision correction surgery such as LASIK or photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) The inability of tears to drain into the nose can occur with: * Some eye infections * Blockage of the tear duct ReferencesSee also * Dry eye syndrome * Tear break-up time External links Photo * Diagram Eye procedures Veterinary diagnosis ","title":"Schirmer's test"},{"id":"1357430","text":"Wood is a natural material produced by the growth of plants, mainly trees and shrubs.

Born in Calgary, Alberta, Keelaghan is now based in Perth, Ontario. Many of the lyrics in his songs display a concern about social problems and justice in society. Examples of such themes include \\"Kiri's Piano\\", about the internment of Japanese Canadians, and \\"October 70\\", about the FLQ crisis, inspired by events and figures in Canadian history. Some of his songs concern tragic historical events, such as \\"Fires of Calais,\\" about the 1940 Dunkirk evacuation of Allied troops during World War II, and \\"Cold Missouri Waters,\\" about the Mann Gulch fire of 1949. Keelaghan's lilting baritone voice, driving rhythm guitar, and a sense of scene and narrative result in his ability to bridge traditional folk music with roots revival and Celtic music. History Keelaghan studied history at the University of Calgary and two of his influences there were Drs. Margaret J. Osler and Sheldon Silverman. With an international following in Australia and England, Keelaghan plays a wide variety of venues from large festivals and concert halls to intimate folk clubs venues and often invites the audience for a beer after his performance. At the 1990 Northern Lights Festival Bor√©al, Keelaghan and guitarist Oscar Lopez participated in a collaborative workshop exploring the fusion of Celtic and Latin music.\\"Just your average 'Celtino' guitar duo; The unlikely fusion of Latin American and Celtic music came easily to Lopez and Keelaghan\\". Toronto Star, October 11, 2007. The duo would later collaborate on two albums, Compadres and ¬øBuddy Where You Been?, further exploring that theme. In 1994, he won the Juno Award for Roots & Traditional Album of the Year - Solo for My Skies. In 2003, Keelaghan won first prize (Folk Category) of the 8th Annual USA Songwriting Competition. His song \\"Cold Missouri Waters\\" was covered by the band Cry Cry Cry in 1998. His songs have also included some by famed folk musicians. They include Roy Bailey and Garnet Rogers. Frequent guest musicians on his albums include Stephen Fearing and Hugh McMillan of Spirit of the West. His latest CD, House of Cards (2009), produced by Keelaghan, is a collection of ten new original songs, some co-written with Karine Polwart, David Francey and others.

The show airs Monday thru Friday, from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. Pacific Time on KFI AM 640, a local Southern California talk radio station.KFI AM 640 More Stimulating Talk Radio The program is one of the most listened to local talk radio programs in the United States. They draw an estimated weekly audience of approximately 1.2 million listeners each week. History John Kobylt was born to a working class Catholic family in Paterson, New Jersey. His father, Chester, was born in Poland and, like many Europeans of his time, was greatly affected by the German aggression. He was taken from his family and held in a Nazi labor camp for five years. He then joined the British military and eventually immigrated to the U.S., where he married a Polish-American woman, Helen. Chester and Helen had two sons, John and Richard, and lived a fairly typical working-class life in northern New Jersey. John entered the radio business as a sportswriter after dropping out of Seton Hall University. Ken Chiampou, a native of Brentwood, New York, was a certified public accountanthttp://www.nysed.gov/coms/op001/opsc2a?profcd=07&plicno;=044037&namechk;=CHI and had graduated from the University at Buffalo, working in corporate audits for a Big Eight firm.http://www.radioguide.com/djprofile/jkprofile.html Both worked in the Elmira-Corning market in New York state in the late 1980s, Kobylt as a disc jockey at WENY and Chiampou at the station's cross-town rival WELM. Kobylt and Chiampou first worked together in 1988 for a radio station in Atlantic City, New Jersey. According to Kobylt, the show was named \\"The Odd Couple\\" by a producer who was the \\"stupidest man on two legs.\\" Kobylt became program director of WOND.Parisi, Albert J. \\"His Beat Is the City's Pulse\\" New York Times, July 10, 1988, Page 12NJ. One of their earliest pranks was while they hosted mornings at 103.7 WMGM. They started a food drive for rival 95.1 WAYV's morning DJ Russ Monroe after he was fired a week before Christmas. The pair, as part of the prank, called WAYV live on the air to solicit a donation, which led to a hang up. In 1990, the pair was offered the afternoon drive slot on the then brand new station New Jersey 101.5 (WKXW-FM) in the state capitol of Trenton, New Jersey. They gained national notoriety for heavily criticizing New Jersey governor Jim Florio for passing the largest state tax hike in United States history immediately after taking office. During this period, their ratings quadrupled to 600,000 listeners. Kobylt criticized Florio for reneging on his promise not to raise taxes.Russakoff, Dale. \\"The Gov Whose Time Has Come, The Washington Post, April 12, 1993, Page B1. A caller, postal worker John Budzash, then suggested the idea of Hands Across New Jersey, a protest that would symbolically cut the state in half.Hands Across New Jersey When other callers noted that blocking traffic was illegal, the movement turned into a rally in front of the State House in Trenton. A State Police officer told Budzash, who reported to the crowd from onstage, that approximately 65,000 people attended the event while another 100,000 people were turned away for lack of parking and because of crowded conditions. It was the largest rally ever held in New Jersey. Kobylt and Chiampou both attended the rally and spoke passionately about Hands Across New Jersey, better government, and lower taxes and they encouraged people to stand up and fight back for a better New Jersey. Florio lost reelection and John and Ken's listenership quadrupled during this period. Kobylt and Chiampou also campaigned feverishly for the abolition of tolls on the New Jersey Turnpike claiming that cutting government excess expenditures could itself fund highway maintenance. They also lobbied for the opening of HOV lanes to regular traffic. The pair left WKXW in late 1992 to move to KFI to do their afternoon drive time spot, replacing former Los Angeles Police Department chief Daryl Gates. The hosts began national syndication in 1997, which displeased management at Cox Communications, then the owners of the station. At its peak, 125 stations carried the program. On March 19, 1999, The John and Ken Show was taken off the air at KFI, allegedly by a vice president in Atlanta over the syndication issue, although the spat was referred to as a \\"contract dispute\\". In addition, the hosts themselves were more comfortable with dealing with state and local issues.Perebinossoff, Phillippe, et al. Programming for TV, Radio, and the Internet, Page 60. Kobylt and Chiampou were replaced by syndicated consumer advocate Clark Howard from 3 pm to 4 pm followed by Karel and Andrew, the first openly gay couple in weekday talk radio in the country. Kobylt and Chiampou publicly referred to them as \\"Siegfried and Roy\\", and constantly berated the show for its low quality and lower ratings compared with their own show. On July 1, 1999, The John and Ken Show was reborn as a morning drive talk show on crosstown competitor KABC. The morning show was short-lived as they kept their afternoon show style and brought it to the mornings. Kobylt and Chiampou also had various stunts, one of which got them in trouble and forced them into attending diversity training, which they later said they resented taking, and disliked the Disney management toning down their banter. Due to low ratings and mutual dissatisfaction between the station and the hosts, KABC dropped the show on October 20, 2000. The John and Ken Show returned to KFI on May 2, 2001, and the hosts regaled listeners with the behind-the-scene problems at KABC before returning to their normal topics. Since then they have remained as a live program; however, some interviews are pre-recorded and replayed between hours, and at times Kobylt or Chiampou will broadcast from their home studios. On January 14, 2006, a new version of the show entitled John and Ken: Saturdays began. The show has been repeated on the weekend from time to time, however, J&K;: Saturdays covers new material that was otherwise omitted during the week. The hosts did not actually show up to the studio live on Saturday but taped the Saturday edition during the week as time permits. J&K; Saturdays was syndicated to other stations. The Saturday show was cancelled in September 2009 due to an expansion in their weekday time slot from the cancellation of Dr. Laura Schlessinger's program. With the hiring of Bill Carroll in February 2010, the program reverted to its 3 p.m.-7 p.m. slot. On March 4, 2006, Kobylt and Chiampou won the Radio & Records News/Talk Local Personality of the Year award, sharing the honor with KGO radio host Ronn Owens. Chiampou, accepting the award on behalf of the pair, mischievously thanked Antonio Villaraigosa, Stanley Tookie Williams, David Dreier, L.A. Archbishop Cardinal Roger Mahony, Robert Blake, Michael D. Brown, and Armando Garcia for providing the material that made the program possible.R&R; ‚Äì Radio & Records, Inc They were also nominated for the 2006 National Association of Broadcasters Marconi Award. On September 10, 2009, The John and Ken Show started simulcasting the 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. portion of the show on San Francisco, California's KNEW (AM)-910. In the opening of the 3 p.m. hour, Kobylt welcomed the new listeners to the show, and promised the old listeners that the format would not change, despite the newly expanded audience. In July 2010, the program was replaced with John Gibson.KNEW Replaces John And Ken With John Gibson  AllAccess.com On January 2, 2013, John and Ken began hosting on KFI sister station, WOR in New York City, from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. The first hour, from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m. was simulcast from the KFI show, while the 10 p.m. to 11 p.m. hour is live and local for New York City. In December 2013, as part of a revamp, John and Ken ceased to air on WOR.http://www.insideradio.com/Article.asp?id=2733025&spid;=32061#.UzJQsvldUrU The show moved from its traditional 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. time slot to 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. as part of a station revamp.https://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/95886/kfi-debuts-new-schedule/ Kobylt's wife, Debra Zara, is a former TV news correspondent. Chiampou lives with his longtime partner. Political and social activism John Kobylt and his bullhorn ‚Äì 2005 David Allyn Dokich protest In 2003, Kobylt and Chiampou were instrumental in the recall of California Governor Gray Davis. Davis, who was derisively called Gumby on the show for his shifting positions on issues, was criticized on a daily basis for the state's budget deficit, signing a bill that would give drivers' licenses to illegal immigrants, increasing the state's car licensing fee, offering large concessions to state employee labor unions, and for his alleged role in creating the California electricity crisis. The hosts regularly had recall petition gatherers on the air and almost immediately threw their support to Arnold Schwarzenegger when he announced he would run for governor. On October 6, 2003, as part of the fallout from Schwarzenegger's scandals, the hosts read information from the Los Angeles Superior Court, purporting that one of the key accusers against Schwarzenegger had a long criminal record. In fact, the information retrieved was about an individual who had nothing to do with the scandal, and the pointers to the information were provided by a Schwarzenegger assistant. The hosts apologized on October 8, after the election.LA Weekly ‚Äì General ‚Äì Arnold's True Lie ‚Äì Nikki Finke ‚Äì The Essential Online Resource for Los Angeles Increasingly, after Schwarzenegger's 2006 re-election, Kobylt and Chiampou criticized several of his policies, as Schwarzenegger moved to the center following the election. The tirades culminated with an image of Schwarzenegger's head on a sword after the governor signed the largest state tax increase in United States history (eclipsing the New Jersey increase). In the run-up to the 2004 elections, their main issue was fighting what they saw as misguided policies of the federal and California state governments to encourage illegal immigration. They devised a \\"competition\\" that they dubbed Political Human Sacrifice, in which five Republican Representatives from California were grilled regarding their stance on illegal immigration. The \\"winner\\" would be the Representative whom the show's listeners saw as the worst on illegal immigration restriction; Kobylt and Chiampou would endorse his or her opponent in the general election and urge listeners to vote for the opponent. Political Human Sacrifice was conducted in a fashion similar to reality television series such as Survivor. U.S. Representative David Dreier won the nomination as the \\"victim\\" of the \\"sacrifice.\\" Kobylt and Chiampou also designated a Democratic Congressman, Joe Baca, to be \\"sacrificed\\" in the general election. The comments about Dreier resulted in a complaint to the Federal Elections Commission being filed by the National Republican Congressional Committee, which was rejected by the FEC on March 17, 2006. As it turned out, both Dreier and Baca won reelection, but this apparently has not deterred Kobylt and Chiampou from their activism on this issue. Dreier outspent his opponent by 30 to 1 and won with 54% of the vote versus 43% for his opponent, his lowest percentage in 24 years. On the other hand, Baca appeared to have been unaffected as he garnered 66.4% of the vote in 2004, exactly the same percentage as his 2002 vote.Baca's 2004 votes.Baca's 2002 votes. On May 2, 2005, KTLA entertainment reporter Sam Rubin made comments alleging that Kobylt employed an illegal immigrant. Kobylt demanded that Rubin apologize on his program for making this allegation without any basis in fact, and later Kobylt's wife called in to berate Rubin for making the statements. Rubin later apologized and retracted the statements on the KTLA 5 Morning News, as well as on The John & Ken Show.Ron Fineman's ON THE RECORD Kobylt and Chiampou often do various stunts in regards to their topics. When Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said to a group of illegal alien supporters \\"We clean your toilets\\", the duo urged their listeners to send toilet brushes to the mayor's office, of which thousands were received. Other jokes include taking Cardinal Roger Mahony's words of, \\"So Disappointed,\\" whenever the duo are talking about illegal immigration. When Long Beach, California residents protested the presence of several paroled registered sex offenders living in one apartment complex, Kobylt and Chiampou hosted a remote broadcast near the complex on February 19, 2008. Fueled by this story, on March 11, 2008, and approved with a required second vote on March 18, 2008, Long Beach City Council members voted 7‚Äì0 to enact 18 ordinances heavily restricting the residency and recreational activity of all registered sex offenders. In September 2011, Kobylt and Chiampou expressed opposition to the California Dream Act, a bill that would extend financial aid to immigrants regardless of their legal status. As part of their opposition, they broadcast the cellular number of a spokesperson for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles (CHIRLA). The spokesperson received several hundred phone calls from irate listeners, some of which expressed threats towards the spokesperson. CHIRLA said that the phone number was a private number, although the number was listed on the press release for the event. Subsequent to this, CHIRLA has called for the cancellation of The John and Ken Show, which KFI has resisted. Observers such as Gustavo Arellano have said that the show targets Mexicans specifically, in contrast to other KFI hosts such as Bill Handel that make light of all races, a charge the hosts deny. [Updte: Jesus Christ Responds!] KFI's John and Ken Show Face Boycott by Latino Groups ‚Äì Orange County News ‚Äì Navel Gazing Kobylt apologized on KMEX-TV to Cabrera for the behavior of their listeners. In February 2012, John and Ken were suspended for making disparaging comments in reference to Whitney Houston. While speculating on Clive Davis's reaction to Houston's death, Kobylt imagined Davis calling her a 'crack ho' and making other derogatory comments on Houston's alleged drug use and mental state. This caused a stir in media circles and in the African- American community as racially insensitive reference to the recently dead singer. They were suspended for seven days \\"for making insensitive and inappropriate comments about the late Whitney Houston.\\" John Kobylt later said, \\"We made a mistake, and we accept the station's decision. We used language that was inappropriate, and we sincerely apologize to our listeners and to the family of Ms. Houston.\\" Many in the Los Angeles radio market came to John and Ken's defense including KROQ's Kevin and Bean who used an entire segment of their February 17, 2012 show to discuss the duo's suspension and the current overall state of political correctness within talk radio. The duo was named one of the 100 most influential people in Southern California by the Los Angeles Times in 2006.\\"Our list of the most powerful people in Southern California\\". Los Angeles Times West Magazine, August 13, 2006. Page 16. Similarly, Governor Jerry Brown singled out Kobylt and Chiampou, along with Jon Coupal, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, taxpayer advocate Grover Norquist, and California Republican Party vice chair Jon Fleischman as a \\"legion of acceptability\\" in influencing Republican votes in the California State Legislature. Format The show is generally broadcast directly from the studios of KFI, with guests usually appearing on the show via telephone. There are occasional remote broadcasts to the site of news or to various political rallies. Also, KFI news reporters come on the show and expand on stories aired in the newscasts. The 5 p.m. hour is the most listened to hour of the show and is sometimes themed. The Political Human Sacrifice Hour, Hour of O.J., Michael Jackson Hour, Tookie Must Die for Murdering Four Innocent People, Tax Revolt, Heads on a Stick, and Waiting for Jerry hour appeared in this time slot. Themes of the show include the destruction of California by labor unions, illegal immigration, corruption by politicians, increased taxes, and the criminal justice system. Celebrity gossip and weird news stories are also used to fill up the hour. Unlike other programs where the hosts may contrast each other, they generally agree on most issues. Kobylt tends to be more bombastic while Chiampou passively feeds Kobylt's anger. In a profile in the Atlantic Monthly about fellow talk show host John Ziegler, David Foster Wallace called Kobylt's voice \\"consistently snarling, dyspeptic, [with a] fed-up quality‚Äîa perfect aural analogue to the way drivers' faces look in jammed traffic\\", and concluded that Kobylt's rage was a \\"demagoguery of the most classic and unabashed sort.\\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/print/2005/04/host/3812/ Recurring features of the show include Chiampou's Friday movie review, where he grades one movie released that week on a 1-10 scale, with 10 being highest; the \\"Moist Line\\", which plays edited listener comments on a voice mail line; and Hack in a Dumpster which is a homage to 2014 Ukraine revolution in metaphorically disposing of a public figure which the hosts disagree with.http://www.kfiam640.com/onair/john-and-ken-37487/fridays-hack-in-the- dumpster-13038715/ Other features include The John & Ken Health and Science Desk, covering medical news;http://www.kfiam640.com/media/podcast-john-and- ken-on-demand-JohnandKen/health-and-science-desk-5pm-725-25077160/ Execution Desk, covering news on the death penalty;http://www.kfiam640.com/media/podcast-john-and-ken-on-demand- JohnandKen/first-execution-desk-of-2015-6pm-25730903/ and Naked Desk, with news stories involving people who are nude.http://www.kfiam640.com/media/podcast-john-and-ken-on-demand- JohnandKen/the-naked-desk-makes-its-debut-25720812/ One regular segment that does accept significant caller participation is The Hour of Rage, where callers rant either about a topic selected by the host or do freeform rants. However, it is common for an entire show to pass without a call being taken from a listener. Some of their most outrageous antics have taken place during high-profile criminal trials. Targets of their bombast have included O.J. Simpson, Scott Peterson, Robert Blake, and Michael Jackson. Kobylt became nationally known when he stood in front of Scott Peterson's house with a bullhorn, demanding that Peterson give an interview. For several months the pair ran a 5 p.m. show called the \\"Tookie Must Die for Murdering Four Innocent People Hour,\\" culminating on December 12, 2005, when they broadcast live outside of San Quentin Prison before the execution of Stanley Tookie Williams. Kobylt and Chiampou were active during David Westerfield's trial for the Murder of Danielle van Dam. Kobylt shouted, \\"Hey, Westerfield, are you in there? Did you kill Danielle?\\". Kobylt also tossed broccoli at \\"vegetable head\\" jurors, who were not convicting Westerfield swiftly enough in his opinion.https://www.theatlantic.com/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/64e.html They also interviewed Danielle's parents, Damon and Brenda van Dam. Every night at 6:15 and 6:40 pm, they did a regular segment called \\"Driving It Home with John and Ken\\". In this segment, they talk with KTLA's Micah Ohlman (or a different anchor if Ohlman's not present) about that day's hot topic or watercooler stories. The 6:15 pm version is live on TV only, while the 6:40 pm version is live on both radio and TV. These segments were discontinued after the Whitney Houston incident. Political views The hosts eschew any party labels or loyalties, and were not politically involved prior to their experience in New Jersey. Kobylt has indicated that his role is \\"to identify who the bad guy is and what the bad act is so that people feel it viscerally... pointing out how they were screwed in some way.\\" Mostly fiscally conservative on issues like taxes, they also frequently lean conservative with regard to crime.Bailey, Eric.

They tend to be moderate to liberal on the use of marijuana. Kobylt came under fire for comments regarding the fashion industry, suggesting that gay men, who Kobylt proclaimed 'control the industry', \\"like bodies that remind them of a 14-year-old boy\\". They opposed Proposition 187 when it first came out, later coming to an anti-illegal immigration viewpoint after continued prodding from listeners. In the 2006 elections in California, they endorsed six Republicans and one Democrat in statewide races. In 2007, Kobylt appeared at a fundraiser for Republican presidential contender Rudy Giuliani.Jubal:\\"OC Blog\\" In 2008, they opposed Proposition 8, which banned gay marriage within California. One notable disagreement between the two was in the 2008 presidential election, where Kobylt voted for John McCain while Chiampou voted for Barack Obama. The two then discussed the merits of their candidates and defended their choices. Kobylt spoke about McCain's history of opposing wasteful spending while Chiampou stated how he felt that Obama was best suited to bring meaningful reform after what both agreed was a need to break away from the shortcomings of the Bush years.

His father, Leo Handel, was a Polish Jew who had hidden in a Jesuit house and lived as a Catholic priest during World War II. Much of the Handel family lost their lives in the Holocaust. Leo applied to emigrate to the United States legally, waiting for eleven years to obtain entry. During this time he lived in Brazil where he met and married his wife, Nechama, a dentist. The Handel family emigrated to the U.S. when Bill was six. He was sworn in as a U.S. citizen at the age of eleven, at which time he changed his name to William Wolf Handel. Handel speaks fluent Brazilian Portuguese. He spent the remainder of his formative years growing up in the San Fernando Valley.

Handel sometimes refers to himself as a \\"Latino Jew\\" after having spent his early years in South America. Although he makes fun of his own heritage, and all stereotypes, one of his more serious and memorable excursions involved taking white supremacist John Metzger to Auschwitz to view the Nazi concentration camps and the gas chamber where Handel's grandfather was executed. The German government originally thought that KFI was a Neo-Nazi radio station and did not want to allow the trip, but finally relented after being presented with more information. He hosted a weekly syndicated television show, Judge For Yourself, which was canceled due to low ratings and the lack of time in Handel's schedule. Judge For Yourself was unique in that it solicited comments from a 900 number, whose results would be broadcast on the next day's show.On Tv: Gabfests Taking Over The Airwaves , lib.vt.edu; accessed November 13, 2015.

Personal life Handel is married with twin daughters. Radio work Handel joined 640 KFI Los Angeles in 1989 doing a weekend legal show called \\"Handel On The Law.\\" On July 16, 1993, Handel began broadcasting a talk and information wake up show, replacing the prior morning team. Prior to January 2014, The Bill Handel Show aired from 5 a.m. to 9 a.m., and was heavily news based. The first hour was primarily discussion of Handel's personal life, letters to the show, and banter with other staffers. The light banter in the 5 a.m. hour was cut when, in January 2014, the show moved to its current 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. time slot. The show now begins with the Handel on the News, a summary of the morning's top stories delivered with Handel's commentary, with appropriate music cues starting each story and playing \\"under\\" his delivery. In the second, third and fourth hour, Handel has guests to discuss topics in the news. He often covers a single news story or item of interest for a half-hour, summarizing various other perspectives and offering his own opinion. Handel on the News: Late Edition airs at 8:30 am, is a condensed version of the 6 am hour, and includes stories not covered in the earlier version.Carney, Steve. \\"Humor, issues and a cause; Bill Handel's talk show is tops with morning listeners, but he is most proud of his support of surrogate parenting.\\" Los Angeles Times, August 15, 2003.

The show is heard Saturday mornings on KFI, but affiliate stations may air it at any time during the weekend. From September 8, 2009 to February 12, 2010, Handel aired an additional show from noon to 2 p.m. on KFI after Dr. Laura Schlessinger moved from KFI to another Los Angeles talk station, 980 KFWB. Handel's afternoon show was syndicated to a handful of affiliates, though Premiere Radio Networks did not aggressively market the show. (It aired at the same time as the much more prominent The Sean Hannity Show.) Handel quit the show after five months. On September 11, 2001, Handel was on air live when the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center took place. Most of the Clear Channel FM music stations in Los Angeles switched over to a live feed of Handel's show as news reports and further attacks unfolded. At that time, Rush Limbaugh's show normally would follow The Bill Handel Show on KFI. Not only was Limbaugh on a plane heading to a golf tournament that day, but telecommunications systems were devastated in New York, where his show was based at that time.

The apology closes with the statement \\"and any and all...groups that might possibly have been offended during the broadcast of this show.\\" Handel on the News, October 18, 2007; accessed November 13, 2015. On December 15, 2006, KFI suspended Handel for one week after an on-air shouting match with Jamie White on FM sister station 98.7 KYSR. White allegedly told one of Handel's daughters to \\"get out\\" of his studio. Handel later apologized, claiming he lost his temper and had overreacted without having all the facts. Jamie White later said publicly as a guest on 97.1 KLSX (now KAMP) that she understood Handel's reaction as a parent and that she and Handel had seen each other months later at a radio event and \\"were fine.\\" On May 13, 2009, Handel commented on a show about health care that the U.S. government should \\"euthanize old people,\\" \\"sell Glendale to get rid of the Armenians\\" and \\"get rid of the Irish and the Italians too.\\" These comments were followed up the next day when a listener sent a letter requesting an apology for the remarks he made. After reading his letter aloud, his board operator, Lara Hermanson, joked that \\"what the Turks started, Bill will finish\\" referencing the Armenian Genocide. KFI AM 640 Program Director Robin Bertolucci apologized and maintained that Handel was \\"clearly engaging in parody and hyperbole to point out the absurdity of genocide as a solution to rising health care costs. No one was actually advocating hatred against Armenians. The comments were obviously said in jest, in the same breath with advocating euthanasia for the elderly and genocide for the Jews. The comments made were solely mocking the idea of genocide and weren't intended to be about Armenians any more than they were about euthanasia for the elderly.\\"Group criticizes radio DJ‚Äôs remarks, GlendaleNewsPress.coml, June 4, 2009; retrieved 2012-05-28.

Beagle Brigade is a team of beagles and their human handlers who, as part of the United States Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), inspect luggage at U.S. airports searching for agricultural products. According to the USDA, the Beagle Brigade program averages around 75,000 seizures of prohibited agricultural products a year. Unauthorized meat, animal byproducts, fruit and vegetables can carry diseases and pests that have the potential to infect U.S. agriculture. For example, foot-and-mouth disease could be introduced into the U.S. via contaminated meat products brought into the country by a traveller. The APHIS works in conjunction with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the United States Public Health Service at entry points to the U.S., including land borders, ports and airports. The Beagle Brigade generally works in the baggage-claim area at international airports. Originally bred for rabbit hunting, the beagle has an acute sense of smell; they can detect smells that are too faint to be sensed by scientific equipment. In addition, they have a voracious and undiscerning appetite. Beagles are generally friendly and gentle with people, and, due to their small size, are not intimidating. For these reasons, beagles were chosen as the breed to be used for these APHIS airport inspections. The APHIS airport inspection program was begun in 1984 at Los Angeles International Airport. In 2004, there were more than 60 Beagle Brigade teams at 21 international airports. The canine members of the Beagle Brigade have either been donated by private owners and breeders, or rescued from animal shelters. The dogs are evaluated for appropriateness, such as friendliness and intelligence. Those beagles that are not selected for the program are placed in adoptive homes. None are returned to animal shelters. Beagles have the ability to categorize smells. Therefore, they can distinguish between smells emanating from restricted items (such as fruit, vegetables, and meat) and non- restricted items. When a member of the Beagle Brigade smells a restricted scent, it sits down next to the luggage to alert its handler, who then talks to the owner, and, if necessary, performs a search. Experienced beagles have a 90% success rate, and can recognize almost 50 distinct smells. A beagle's career with the Beagle Brigade usually lasts between six and ten years. When they retire, they are usually adopted by their handlers (handlers and dogs are paired throughout the beagle's career). Otherwise, they are placed in adoptive homes. The USDA National Detector Dog Training Center in Newnan, Georgia, receives beagles donated by private owners, breeders, and animal shelters.

Their debut album A Flock of Bleeps was released in 2003, followed by The Last Days of Gravity in 2007 and Vaccine in 2011. After making a remix for a charity record, Simon Posford (Shpongle, Hallucinogen) and Benji Vaughan (Prometheus) formed the band. Name The band's name is taken from a Kogi prophecy; the Kogi regarded themselves as the Older Brother and say that the destruction of the Earth and environment would be by Westerners called Younger Brother. Simon Posford and Benji Vaughan describe this in the Twisted DVD from 2007 during an interview. Fragments from this prophecy are found in the song \\"Evil and Harm\\". A Flock of Bleeps The album A Flock of Bleeps released on Twisted Records became a cult classic in the underground electronica scene and included such tracks as \\"Crumblenaut\\" and \\"Finger\\". This led to demand to see them live and they have played shows from London to Tokyo, New York to Moscow. Last Days of Gravity Inspired by the live shows, Simon and Benji decided to move away from the pure electronic sound of the first album A Flock of Bleeps and create a more organic sound. Having no band, they played the instruments themselves and recruited long-time friend and former Leftfield vocalist Ruu Campbell to perform the vocals. The resulting album was Last Days of Gravity, with artwork made by Storm Thorgerson, who had also worked on albums by Pink Floyd, Alan Parsons and Led Zeppelin. Released in 2007, the album narrowly missed a nomination for the 2008 Mercury Music Prize and received positive reviews. They also returned to play shows with the \\"Younger Brother Live\\" band in Boulder and Denver, Colorado and in California, which included Marc Brownstein (The Disco Biscuits, Electron) on bass, Tom Hamilton (Brothers Past, The American Babies, Electron) on guitar, and Joe Russo (The Benevento/Russo Duo, Furthur, Joe Russo‚Äôs Almost Dead, Bustle In Your Hedgerow, The American Babies, Electron) on drums in Japan, the US and the UK. 2009 saw Younger Brother produce \\"Phoenix in Dynamite Sky\\" for British cult film Heartless, directed by Philip Ridley. Vaccine Their third album Vaccine, recorded with its U.S. band lineup (Marc Brownstein - the Disco Biscuits, Joe Russo (musician) - Benevento/Russo Duo/Furthur (band) & Tom Hamilton - Brothers Past), became available on 4 April 2011. In 2014, the band developed an app for mobile devices and released an alternate album of remixes titled Vaccine Electronic as a free stream for users who installed it. On 16 August 2014, Benji Vaughn stated on Younger Brothers' Facebook page that he would \\"be going quiet for a while\\" and that \\"it's time to disappear for a few years\\".

Much of the range falls within the Gila River Indian Reservation, but of BLM land is protected as the Sierra Estrella Wilderness. Description On the highest peaks, temperatures are usually 8-12 degrees cooler than in the valley. Snow can be seen at least once or twice a year on the highest points of the mountain range (typically above 4,000 ft). Sometimes, the snow level can drop near , but depends if the precipitation reaches the mountain range. A good example is during the month of March 2006, when a heavy storm system reached the state and lowered snow levels near . Once the skies cleared next morning, snow covered the Estrella's mountain tops. Estrella Mountain Regional park occupies in the northern portion of the range. The park offers multi-use trails including a competitive loop for running and mountain biking. Equestrian use is permitted. The park has parking and a riding arena.Estrella Mountain Regional Park  History  The Sierra Estrellas were inhabited by the Akimel O'odham people and also some Yavapai bands at the north end of the range at the time of Spanish colonization, and today the mountains tower over several of the Akimel O'odham and Maricopa villages of the Gila River Indian Community. There are petroglyphs throughout the Southern portion of the range. In the colonial era, they were part of the land claimed as New Spain. Occasionally Spanish explorers or priests, most notably Father Kino, would venture near the range to document the area and contact the Akimel O'odham. On his return from the Colorado River in March 1699, Kino climbed a pass through the Sierra Estrellas and saw the R√≠o Salado and R√≠o Verde that he drew on his maps.Rim of Christendom by Herbert E. Bolton. p. 422 In 1810, Mexico declared its independence from Spain, and the Sierra Estrellas went on to become part of Mexico. In 1827, a French fur trapping expedition led by Michel Robidoux was attacked by Indians (O'odham?) and survivors escaped into the Sierra Estrella mountains. In 1853, the United States acquired the Estrellas from Mexico as part of the Gadsden purchase. It soon became part of a trade route for settlers in California known as the Butterfield Overland stage. People and equipment could be moved across the area much quicker. The route was massively successful its time, moving millions of dollars in supplies. However, it was short-lived. Steam locomotives soon replaced stage coaches across the United States, and the Butterfield Stage Route was no longer utilized.Handbook to Arizona, by Richard J. Hinton In 1857, the Battle of Pima Butte was fought in the area of the mountains. The allied Yuma, Mohave, Yavapai and Apache peoples attacked the Maricopa village of Sacate. The Maricopa and their allies, the Akimel O'odham, defeated the attackers, leaving approximately 200 of them dead or wounded. It is notable for being the last major battle fought solely between indigenous Americans in North America.  Mexican gold  Mexican gold is said to be buried in this range, known as Montezuma's treasure. The legend of Mexican gold in the Estrellas was largely started by John D. Mitchell, a western treasure hunter and author. In his story of Don Joaquin's lost treasure he describes an extensive mine and a stone house in the heart of the Estrellas.\\"Don Joaquin and his Gold Mine,\\" in Lost Mines and Buried Treasures along the Old Frontier by John D. Mitchell, p. 27-31 To give some credit to the story a stone house does exist along with signs of mining.

Its mouth is on the Beaufort Sea on the Arctic Ocean near the eastern end of Liverpool Bay at about 70 degrees north latitude. Its main tributary is the Carnwath River. Originally known as the Beghula River it was renamed to the Anderson River in 1857 by Roderick MacFarlane after James Anderson, both of the Hudson's Bay Company. Anderson was the Chief Factor in the Mackenzie District.Gazetteer of the Northwest Territories , page 16 Geography The Anderson River's northwestern sloping drainage basin is a part of the Anderson Plain High Subarctic (HS) Ecoregion, itself a subsection of the Taiga Plains Ecozone and the Anderson Upland Low Arctic north (LAn) Ecoregion, which is part of the Southern Arctic Ecozone.Ecological Regions of the Northwest Territories Taiga Plains , page 34Ecological Regions of the Northwest Territories Southern Arctic , page The river encompasses wildly varied landscape. Canyons are common in the upper and middle sections, the largest of which is Falcon Canyon, at long and approximately deep. The upper sections of the river are in taiga, with black spruce being the dominant tree. White spruce and shrublands grow on the river's floodplain and valley slopes. There are large deposits of alluvial terraces, along with cretaceous shales, Devonian limestone, and Devonian dolomite. Closer to the ocean, the river pulls above tree line, and continues through rolling tundra east of Inuvik. Whitewater is most intense in the middle section of the river (around Falcon Canyon and upstream). A couple of class III rapids, many class I and II, and no major falls make the Anderson a fun, but not overly demanding whitewater run for experienced paddlers. Wildlife Wildlife is abundant on the Anderson. The Bluenose barren-ground caribou herd, which calves further east near Bluenose Lake, Nunavut, migrates south down parts of the Anderson River valley in July. Muskox, moose, and grizzly bears are also common along the river. Bird life is also abundant and varied. However, the Canadian Wildlife Service's 1999 to 2008 Field Project at the Anderson River Delta entitled \\"Impact of Increased Harvest on the Western Arctic Snow Goose Population\\" shows a decline in snow geese.

History The Anderson River area was the historic home of an Inuvialuit group of Inuit called the Siglit, or Mackenzie Inuit,Chronicling Siglit Identities: Economy, Practice, and Ethnicity in the Western Canadian Arctic known as the Anderson River People. Although the Inuvialuktun name of the people is no longer known it is thought that they may have been called the Kuukugmiut, the Kuungmiut, as used by Emmanuel Felix, or Kramalit by Father √âmile Petitot.Anderson River Inuvialuit at Inuvialuit Living History The first two names are derived from the Inuvialuktun name of the river Kuuk (river) and means \\"people of the river\\". In 1857, Roderick MacFarlane, known to the Inuit as \\"Mitchi Paloum\\",Roderick MacFarlane at Inuvialuit Living History of the Hudson's Bay Company travelled the area looking to establish trade with the Inuit who, due to conflicts with the Gwich'in and the travel required, did not want to visit the post at Fort McPherson. On this trip he was met by a group of Inuit who proved to be hostile and he returned to Fort Good Hope. He returned again in 1858 and 1859, experiencing no difficulties and was able to begin trading with the Inuit. In 1860 he was again sent to the area, this time to establish a post for permanent trading. Construction of the post was begun in the spring of 1861 and finished before the onset of winter. The post was located on the east bank of the river about south of Liverpool Bay and north of the Anderson River Forks. While there MacFarlane was visited by Robert Kennicott and at Kennicott's urging began collecting for the Smithsonian Institution. He collected over 5,000 objects, including MacFarlane's bear, which are housed in the MacFarlane Collection. The post was successful until 1864‚Äì65. In 1864 a number of the dogs used to pull the sled were killed by distemper and then in 1865 a combination of scarlet fever and measles killed the majority of the Inuit and First Nations hunters in the area. MacFarlane remained at the fort until 15 July 1866, at which time the post was closed and he was sent to Fort Simpson.Fort Anderson at Inuvialuit Living HistoryTwo Nest Searches for the Eskimo Curlew -- A Century Apart The Inuvialuit Smithsonian Project: Winter 2009-Spring 2011 The Hudson's Bay Company also had a trading post at the river's mouth, later renamed as Stanton after Father Stanton (), which is now abandoned.

Dimension 5 was one of the first Goa trance groups and released vinyl and CDs. The group started in 1989, and around 1994 they released their first early Goa trance recordings, which they described as \\"space techno\\". Back then the group existed of four members: Charlie Clarke, Graham Franklin, Kerry Palmer and Nick Wenham. They started their own label, Intastella Records, in 1996 to have total musical freedom. This resulted in the making of their first full album, Transdimensional in 1997. The album was in demand but never widely distributed. The project's music was not just released on Intastella Records. Many of their tunes made between 1995 and 1998 were also featured on compilations of other labels (Transient Records, Psychic Deli, Leguan, Phantasm Records, BNE and others). In 1998, the group got an extra member, Christer B√∏rge Lunde (also known as Ra, Electron Wave and Outzider). This resulted in another album Second Phaze (2000), released by Blue Moon in Thailand. The CD was re-released by the German labels Velvet Inc/Nova Tekk. After this album, Dimension 5 stopped making music. Activity=1990s: Releases Dimension 5 released several tracks categorized as hardcore, hard trance and trance before they became known for their Goa trance. These were released between 1991 and 1995. In 1996, the group released three 12\\" Goa trance discs and followed with two more in 1997 along with their first album, Transdimensional. This album is generally regarded as their best work and one of the top Goa trance albums. Dimension 5 described their music as \\"space techno psychedelic trance\\" around the time of their debut album and cited Hawkwind, Gong, Tim Blake and Tangerine Dream as some of their major influences. 2000: Releases The group's second album, Second Phaze, was released in 2000. For this release they were joined by the Norwegian, Christer B√∏rge Lunde. In the same year, Christer and Lars Lind, who was not part of Dimension 5, released their own debut album, To Sirius under the alias Ra. This album contained credited collaboration from Clarke in several tracks and gave special thanks to several other Dimension 5 members. In addition to these two releases, the year 2000 saw B√∏rge Lunde and Clarke release The Uncertainty Principle, under the alias Electron Wave. Wenham and Clarke released Magick Universe under the alias Hunab Ku. 2001: Reissues In 2001, due to popularity and the going under of the Blue Moon Productions UK label, Second Phaze, To Sirius and The Uncertainty Principle were all remastered and re-released on Velvet. Inc, a division of GNT, a sublabel of Nova Tekk Records. Magick Universe remains one of the most rare and sought after Goa trance albums. 2007: Anniversary of Transdimensional To commemorate the tenth anniversary of their debut album, Dimension 5 regrouped to play a gig in Antwerp, Belgium. Due to a resurgence of interest in Goa trance and its popularity and fame, Transdimensional was remastered and reissued by Suntrip Records of Belgium in 2007. Demise Dimension 5 has released no new material since 2000, barring a couple of promotional tracks issued in 2002 by Wenham and Clarke billed as Hunab Ku.

The film was written and directed by Burr Steers, and stars Kieran Culkin, Claire Danes, Jeff Goldblum, Susan Sarandon, Amanda Peet, Ryan Phillippe, Bill Pullman and Jared Harris. It was given a limited theatrical release through United Artists on September 13, 2002 in the United States, and received generally positive reviews from critics. Culkin and Sarandon received Golden Globe nominations for their performances. Plot Jason \\"Igby\\" Slocumb, Jr. (Kieran Culkin) is a misanthropic 17-year-old boy, rebelling against the oppressive world of his strict East Coast \\"old money\\" family. His schizophrenic father, Jason (Bill Pullman), has been committed to an institution. Igby fears that he will eventually suffer a mental breakdown like his father. His mother, Mimi (Susan Sarandon), is self-absorbed and distant and has a tendency to drink heavily. Igby mockingly describes his ambitious older brother Ollie (Ryan Phillippe) as a fascist or, alternatively, a Young Republican, and that he studies \\"neo- fascism\\" (economics) at Columbia University. Igby figures that there must be a better life out there, and he sets out to find it, rebelling against his family at every opportunity. After happily flunking out of several prep schools, he ends up in a brutal military academy where he gets beaten by his classmates. After escaping and spending time in a Chicago hotel courtesy of his mother's credit card, Igby is sent to New York for the summer to his godfather, successful real estate magnate D.H. Banes (Jeff Goldblum). While working construction for D.H., Igby first encounters Rachel (Amanda Peet), his godfather's heroin-addicted trophy mistress. Rather than return to school, he escapes into the bohemian underworld of Manhattan, hiding out with Rachel and her performance artist friend Russel (Jared Harris). Eventually, he and Rachel have sex. After being suspected and beaten up by D.H., he then hooks up with terminally bored, part-time lover, Sookie (Claire Danes), only for her to later leave him for Ollie. Despite seeming cold and distant, Mimi is not unaffected by her rebellious son. She describes Igby's conception as an act of animosity and therefore believes that it shouldn't be a surprise that his life follows the same course. His name is explained as a family in-joke. As a child, he would blame his toy bear, Digby, for things he had done, mispronouncing it as \\"Igby\\". In order to get him to take responsibility for his actions, his family would call him Igby whenever he lied. Igby is informed by D.H. that his mother Mimi is dying from breast cancer and so he returns to see her. She has arranged to commit suicide with help from Ollie, who feeds her poisoned strawberry yogurt before ultimately placing a plastic bag over her head. Before she dies, Mimi makes a final revelation, casually inquiring of Igby, \\"I take it you know that D.H. is your father?\\" Igby visits his father in the hospital before leaving for Los Angeles to finally make a clean break by getting 3,000 miles away from his family.

In this example, the gene indicated by the white color is inactivated upon insertion of the foreign DNA fragment. Recombinant DNA (rDNA) molecules are DNA molecules formed by laboratory methods of genetic recombination (such as molecular cloning) to bring together genetic material from multiple sources, creating sequences that would not otherwise be found in the genome. Recombinant DNA is the general name for a piece of DNA that has been created by combining at least two fragments from two different sources. Recombinant DNA is possible because DNA molecules from all organisms share the same chemical structure, and differ only in the nucleotide sequence within that identical overall structure. Recombinant DNA molecules are sometimes called chimeric DNA, because they can be made of material from two different species, like the mythical chimera. R-DNA technology uses palindromic sequences and leads to the production of sticky and blunt ends. The DNA sequences used in the construction of recombinant DNA molecules can originate from any species. For example, plant DNA may be joined to bacterial DNA, or human DNA may be joined with fungal DNA. In addition, DNA sequences that do not occur anywhere in nature may be created by the chemical synthesis of DNA, and incorporated into recombinant molecules. Using recombinant DNA technology and synthetic DNA, literally any DNA sequence may be created and introduced into any of a very wide range of living organisms. Proteins that can result from the expression of recombinant DNA within living cells are termed recombinant proteins. When recombinant DNA encoding a protein is introduced into a host organism, the recombinant protein is not necessarily produced. Expression of foreign proteins requires the use of specialized expression vectors and often necessitates significant restructuring by foreign coding sequences. Recombinant DNA differs from genetic recombination in that the former results from artificial methods in the test tube, while the latter is a normal biological process that results in the remixing of existing DNA sequences in essentially all organisms. Creation 300px Molecular cloning is the laboratory process used to create recombinant DNA.. Fourth edition is available online through the NCBI Bookshelf: link Fifth edition available online through the NCBI Bookshelf: link It is one of two most widely used methods, along with polymerase chain reaction (PCR), used to direct the replication of any specific DNA sequence chosen by the experimentalist. There are two fundamental differences between the methods. One is that molecular cloning involves replication of the DNA within a living cell, while PCR replicates DNA in the test tube, free of living cells. The other difference is that cloning involves cutting and pasting DNA sequences, while PCR amplifies by copying an existing sequence. Formation of recombinant DNA requires a cloning vector, a DNA molecule that replicates within a living cell. Vectors are generally derived from plasmids or viruses, and represent relatively small segments of DNA that contain necessary genetic signals for replication, as well as additional elements for convenience in inserting foreign DNA, identifying cells that contain recombinant DNA, and, where appropriate, expressing the foreign DNA. The choice of vector for molecular cloning depends on the choice of host organism, the size of the DNA to be cloned, and whether and how the foreign DNA is to be expressed. The DNA segments can be combined by using a variety of methods, such as restriction enzyme/ligase cloning or Gibson assembly. In standard cloning protocols, the cloning of any DNA fragment essentially involves seven steps: (1) Choice of host organism and cloning vector, (2) Preparation of vector DNA, (3) Preparation of DNA to be cloned, (4) Creation of recombinant DNA, (5) Introduction of recombinant DNA into the host organism, (6) Selection of organisms containing recombinant DNA, and (7) Screening for clones with desired DNA inserts and biological properties. These steps are described in some detail in a related article (molecular cloning). Expression Following transplantation into the host organism, the foreign DNA contained within the recombinant DNA construct may or may not be expressed. That is, the DNA may simply be replicated without expression, or it may be transcribed and translated and a recombinant protein is produced. Generally speaking, expression of a foreign gene requires restructuring the gene to include sequences that are required for producing an mRNA molecule that can be used by the host's translational apparatus (e.g. promoter, translational initiation signal, and transcriptional terminator). Specific changes to the host organism may be made to improve expression of the ectopic gene. In addition, changes may be needed to the coding sequences as well, to optimize translation, make the protein soluble, direct the recombinant protein to the proper cellular or extracellular location, and stabilize the protein from degradation. Properties of organisms containing recombinant DNA In most cases, organisms containing recombinant DNA have apparently normal phenotypes. That is, their appearance, behavior and metabolism are usually unchanged, and the only way to demonstrate the presence of recombinant sequences is to examine the DNA itself, typically using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Significant exceptions exist, and are discussed below. If the rDNA sequences encode a gene that is expressed, then the presence of RNA and/or protein products of the recombinant gene can be detected, typically using RT-PCR or western hybridization methods. Gross phenotypic changes are not the norm, unless the recombinant gene has been chosen and modified so as to generate biological activity in the host organism. Additional phenotypes that are encountered include toxicity to the host organism induced by the recombinant gene product, especially if it is over-expressed or expressed within inappropriate cells or tissues. In some cases, recombinant DNA can have deleterious effects even if it is not expressed. One mechanism by which this happens is insertional inactivation, in which the rDNA becomes inserted into a host cell's gene. In some cases, researchers use this phenomenon to \\"knock out\\" genes to determine their biological function and importance. Another mechanism by which rDNA insertion into chromosomal DNA can affect gene expression is by inappropriate activation of previously unexpressed host cell genes. This can happen, for example, when a recombinant DNA fragment containing an active promoter becomes located next to a previously silent host cell gene, or when a host cell gene that functions to restrain gene expression undergoes insertional inactivation by recombinant DNA. Uses Recombinant DNA is widely used in biotechnology, medicine and research. Today, recombinant proteins and other products that result from the use of DNA technology are found in essentially every western pharmacy, physician or veterinarian office, medical testing laboratory, and biological research laboratory. In addition, organisms that have been manipulated using recombinant DNA technology, as well as products derived from those organisms, have found their way into many farms, supermarkets, home medicine cabinets, and even pet shops, such as those that sell GloFish and other genetically modified animals. The most common application of recombinant DNA is in basic research, in which the technology is important to most current work in the biological and biomedical sciences. Recombinant DNA is used to identify, map and sequence genes, and to determine their function. rDNA probes are employed in analyzing gene expression within individual cells, and throughout the tissues of whole organisms. Recombinant proteins are widely used as reagents in laboratory experiments and to generate antibody probes for examining protein synthesis within cells and organisms. Many additional practical applications of recombinant DNA are found in industry, food production, human and veterinary medicine, agriculture, and bioengineering. Some specific examples are identified below. ;Recombinant chymosin Found in rennet, chymosin is an enzyme required to manufacture cheese. It was the first genetically engineered food additive used commercially. Traditionally, processors obtained chymosin from rennet, a preparation derived from the fourth stomach of milk- fed calves. Scientists engineered a non-pathogenic strain (K-12) of E. coli bacteria for large-scale laboratory production of the enzyme. This microbiologically produced recombinant enzyme, identical structurally to the calf derived enzyme, costs less and is produced in abundant quantities. Today about 60% of U.S. hard cheese is made with genetically engineered chymosin. In 1990, FDA granted chymosin \\"generally recognized as safe\\" (GRAS) status based on data showing that the enzyme was safe.Donna U. Vogt and Mickey Parish.

A variety of different recombinant insulin preparations are in widespread use. Recombinant insulin is synthesized by inserting the human insulin gene into E. coli, or yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) #Insulin aspart which then produces insulin for human use.DrugBank: Insulin Regular (DB00030) ;Recombinant human growth hormone (HGH, somatotropin) : Administered to patients whose pituitary glands generate insufficient quantities to support normal growth and development. Before recombinant HGH became available, HGH for therapeutic use was obtained from pituitary glands of cadavers. This unsafe practice led to some patients developing Creutzfeldt‚ÄìJakob disease. Recombinant HGH eliminated this problem, and is now used therapeutically. It has also been misused as a performance- enhancing drug by athletes and others. DrugBank entry ;Recombinant blood clotting factor VIII : A blood-clotting protein that is administered to patients with forms of the bleeding disorder hemophilia, who are unable to produce factor VIII in quantities sufficient to support normal blood coagulation. Before the development of recombinant factor VIII, the protein was obtained by processing large quantities of human blood from multiple donors, which carried a very high risk of transmission of blood borne infectious diseases, for example HIV and hepatitis B. DrugBank entry ;Recombinant hepatitis B vaccine : Hepatitis B infection is controlled through the use of a recombinant hepatitis B vaccine, which contains a form of the hepatitis B virus surface antigen that is produced in yeast cells. The development of the recombinant subunit vaccine was an important and necessary development because hepatitis B virus, unlike other common viruses such as polio virus, cannot be grown in vitro. Vaccine information from Hepatitis B Foundation ;Diagnosis of infection with HIV : Each of the three widely used methods for diagnosing HIV infection has been developed using recombinant DNA. The antibody test (ELISA or western blot) uses a recombinant HIV protein to test for the presence of antibodies that the body has produced in response to an HIV infection. The DNA test looks for the presence of HIV genetic material using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Development of the RT-PCR test was made possible by the molecular cloning and sequence analysis of HIV genomes.

These crops are in common commercial use in several countries. ;Insect-resistant crops : Bacillus thuringeiensis is a bacterium that naturally produces a protein (Bt toxin) with insecticidal properties. The bacterium has been applied to crops as an insect-control strategy for many years, and this practice has been widely adopted in agriculture and gardening. Recently, plants have been developed that express a recombinant form of the bacterial protein, which may effectively control some insect predators. Environmental issues associated with the use of these transgenic crops have not been fully resolved. History The idea of recombinant DNA was first proposed by Peter Lobban, a graduate student of Prof. Dale Kaiser in the Biochemistry Department at Stanford University Medical School.Lear, J. (1978). Recombinant DNA: The Untold Story. New York: Crown Publishers. p. 43. The first publications describing the successful production and intracellular replication of recombinant DNA appeared in 1972 and 1973, from Stanford and UCSF. In 1980 Paul Berg, a professor in the Biochemistry Department at Stanford and an author on one of the first papers was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on nucleic acids \\"with particular regard to recombinant DNA\\". Werner Arber, Hamilton Smith, and Daniel Nathans shared the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of restriction endonucleases which enhanced the techniques of rDNA technology. Stanford University applied for a US patent on recombinant DNA in 1974, listing the inventors as Herbert W. Boyer (professor at the University of California, San Francisco) and Stanley N. Cohen (professor at Stanford University); this patent was awarded in 1980. The first licensed drug generated using recombinant DNA technology was human insulin, developed by Genentech and licensed by Eli Lilly and Company. Controversy  Scientists associated with the initial development of recombinant DNA methods recognized that the potential existed for organisms containing recombinant DNA to have undesirable or dangerous properties. At the 1975 Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA, these concerns were discussed and a voluntary moratorium on recombinant DNA research was initiated for experiments that were considered particularly risky. This moratorium was widely observed until the National Institutes of Health (USA) developed and issued formal guidelines for rDNA work. Today, recombinant DNA molecules and recombinant proteins are usually not regarded as dangerous. However, concerns remain about some organisms that express recombinant DNA, particularly when they leave the laboratory and are introduced into the environment or food chain. These concerns are discussed in the articles on genetically modified organisms and genetically modified food controversies. Furthermore, there are concerns about the by-products in biopharmaceutical production, where recombinant DNA result in specific protein products. The major by-product, termed host cell protein, comes from the host expression system and poses a threat to the patient's health and the overall environment.

Tsegaye Gabre-Medhin (c.1960) Gabre-Medhin on a 2010 commemorative stamp Biography Tsegaye Gabre-Medhin was born in Bodaa village, near Ambo, Oromia Region, Ethiopia, some 120 km from the capital near Addis Ababa. As many Ethiopian boys do, he also learned Ge'ez, the ancient language of the church, which is an Ethiopian equivalent of Latin. He also helped the family by caring for cattle. He was still very young when he began to write plays while at the local elementary school. One of those plays, King Dionysus and the Two Brothers, was staged in the presence, among others, of Emperor Haile Selassie. Gabre-Medhin later attended the prestigious British Council-supported General Wingate school ‚Äì named after British officer Orde Wingate. He subsequently attended the Commercial school in Addis Ababa, where he won a scholarship to Blackstone School of Law in Chicago in 1959. In 1960 he travelled to Europe to study experimental drama at the Royal Court Theatre in London and the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise in Paris. Upon returning to Ethiopia, he devoted himself to managing and developing the Ethiopian National Theater ‚Äì which institution staged an impressive memorial for its former director. During this time Gabre-Medhin travelled widely; he attended the first UNESCO-organised World Festival of Black Arts in Dakar, Senegal, and the in Algiers. In 1966, at the age of only 29, he was awarded his country's highest literary honour, the Haile Selassie I Prize for Amharic Literature, joining the ranks of such distinguished previous recipients as Kebede Michael. The prize earned him the title of Laureate, by which he has ever since been known. Following the Ethiopian revolution of 1974, Gabre-Medhin was appointed for a short time as vice-minister of culture and sports, and was active in setting up Addis Ababa University department of Theatre Arts. In 1984 he wrote an extended, and very poetical, essay \\"Footprints in Time\\", which appeared in large format with photographs by the Italian photographer Alberto Tessore. It traced Ethiopian history from the prehistoric time of Lucy, the first-known hominid that had recently been found in the Afar Desert in eastern Ethiopia. One of Gabre-Medhin's passionate interests throughout this time was in the struggle to regain Ethiopia's looted treasures. A close friend of Chief Olusegun Olusola, the Nigerian Ambassador in Addis Ababa, who was a fellow poet, Gabre-Medhin was present when the ambassador agreed to throw his diplomatic pressure behind the national demand for the return of the Aksum obelisk, which had been taken on Mussolini's personal orders in 1937. The chief's support marked a turning point in the Aksum Obelisk Return movement. Gabre-Medhin was no less insistent that Britain should return the manuscripts, crosses, tents and other loot taken from Emperor Tewodros' mountain citadel. Much of this loot is currently in the British Museum, the British Library, and the Royal Library in Windsor Castle. Gabre-Medhin always believed in the unity of the Ethiopian people and felt that this by far transcended purely political matters of the day. In later years he concerned himself increasingly with questions of peace, human rights and the dignity of humanity. He was elected to the United Poets Laureate International, and received many international awards ‚Äì the last of them from Norway. Although unable to return to his native land, which lacked the dialysis facilities on which his life depended, he remained in close contact with the Ethiopian diaspora. Gabre-Medhin died in Manhattan, where he had moved in 1998 to receive treatment for kidney disease. He was buried in Addis Ababa at Holy Trinity Cathedral church, where the body of Emperor Haile Selassie lies.  Works  Tsegaye Gabre-Medhin was proud of Ethiopia's long history of independence and her unique cultural heritage. He insisted emphatically that his country needed heroes, and used the theatre deliberately to teach his compatriots to respect the Ethiopian heroes of their past. One of the most widely acclaimed of his plays, Tewodros, commemorates the life of Tewodros II. Considered a pioneer reformer and moderniser, the emperor committed suicide in 1868 rather than fall into the hands of a hostile British expeditionary force. Another of Gabre-Medhin's plays, Petros at the Hour, tells the story of Abune Petros, the Bishop who accompanied the Ethiopian troops in their struggle to resist the Italian fascist occupation. Captured by the enemy on the outskirts of Addis Ababa, the prelate was executed after a show trial. A third play, The Oda Oak Oracle, a tragedy about Ethiopian country life, also enjoyed great popularity, both in Ethiopia and abroad. Besides these compositions, Gabre-Medhin translated Shakespeare (Hamlet and Othello being the most popular of these works), as well as Moli√®re's Tartuffe and Le M√©decin malgr√© lui, as well as Bertolt Brecht's Mother Courage. Gabre-Medhin's poems, both in Amharic and English, were also widely read. A score of them, including \\"Prologue to African Conscience\\" and \\"Black Antigone\\", were published in the Ethiopia Observer in 1965. Another poem, in Amharic, castigated the European nomenclature for the waterfalls of Sudan and Egypt ‚Äì which totally ignored those of Ethiopia, and caused Gabre- Medhin proudly to refer to the Tis Abay, or Blue Nile Falls, as the \\"Zero Cataract\\".

It was fought between the United States and a British and Native American alliance near the River Raisin in Frenchtown, (present-day Monroe, Michigan). On January 18, 1813, the Americans forced the retreat of the British and their Native American allies from Frenchtown, which they had earlier occupied, in a relatively minor skirmish. The movement was part of a larger United States plan to advance north and retake Fort Detroit, following its loss in the Siege of Detroit the previous summer. Despite this initial success, the British and Native Americans rallied and launched a surprise counterattack four days later on January 22. Ill-prepared, the Americans lost 397 soldiers in this second battle, while 547 were taken prisoner. Dozens of wounded prisoners were murdered the next day in a massacre by the Native Americans. More prisoners were killed if they could not keep up on the forced march to Fort Malden. This was the deadliest conflict recorded on Michigan soil, and the casualties included the highest number of Americans killed in a single battle during the War of 1812. Parts of the original battlefield were designated as a state historic park and added to the National Register of Historic Places. In 2009 Congress authorized its upgrade into the River Raisin National Battlefield Park, one of four such parks in the nation and the only one commemorating the War of 1812. Naming The Battle of Frenchtown took place in and around the Frenchtown Settlement, founded in 1784 on the River Raisin in the Michigan Territory. The land it was fought on is now incorporated into the city of Monroe. Some sources apply the name only to the encounter on January 22, 1813, and refer to the engagement on January 18 as the First Battle of the River Raisin, or simply as a prelude to the larger encounter on January 22. The plural Battles of Frenchtown is also used for the overall conflict from January 18 through 22. While the battle began on January 18, the heaviest fighting took place on January 22 and may have continued for several days after that. It is often referred to as the Battle of the River Raisin, because of its proximity to that river. The engagement may be divided into the First Battle of the River Raisin (January 18) and the Second Battle of the River Raisin (January 22). The name \\"River Raisin Massacre\\" is used for the events of January 23, the day after the surrender, when pro-British Indians murdered dozens of wounded United States prisoners. These volunteer soldiers from Kentucky were too badly injured to march overland to Canada, and the Native Americans decided to kill them instead. Background Location of Frenchtown and other settlements near the west coast of Lake Erie during the period. On August 17, 1812, Brigadier General William Hull, commanding the American Army of the Northwest, surrendered his troops and Fort Detroit to the British army following the Siege of Detroit. This early success convinced many Native Americans to side with Britain in the war. General Hull was later tried by a military court and sentenced to death for his \\"disgraceful conduct\\" at Detroit. However, President James Madison commuted the sentence to dismissal from the army in recognition of Hull's honorable service during the American Revolution. At that time, Fort Detroit was a strategic outpost and a potential base for any US invasion of British Upper Canada. Its loss to the British gave them a base to increase their presence in the Michigan Territory. When the British captured Detroit, the Frenchtown militia also surrendered and were disarmed. Just south of Fort Detroit, Frenchtown's residents were helpless against the British and Native Americans who now were almost on their doorstep. They urged the Americans to regroup and drive the invaders back to Upper Canada. Following Hull's dismissal, Brigadier General James Winchester was given command of the Army of the Northwest. Instead of pushing north to retake Detroit, Winchester had a less ambitious plan. His resulting unpopularity caused the command to be given to Major General William Henry Harrison. Winchester was retained as second-in-command. Harrison's first plan on taking command was to march his men north and recover Detroit. To accomplish this, he divided the army into two columns. Harrison would lead one column, with the other led by Winchester. Meanwhile, Brigadier General Henry Procter, commanding the British Army around Detroit, assembled all the British troops available, supported by about 500 Native Americans under the Shawnee leader Tecumseh. While Tecumseh was present during the Frenchtown fighting, he did not participate and left before the massacre. First Battle of the River Raisin James Winchester, the second-in-command of the Army of the Northwest, led a column consisting of approximately 1,000 inexperienced regulars and volunteers, most of whom came from Kentucky. Major General William Henry Harrison had ordered him to remain within supporting distance of Harrison's column near the Maumee River (in present-day Perrysburg, Ohio) about south of Frenchtown. Instead, Winchester ignored his orders and sent a small relief detachment north to Frenchtown along the River Raisin. historic marker indicates where Lt Col William Lewis and his troops crossed the frozen River Raisin on January 18. Lieutenant Colonel William Lewis led these men across the frozen Maumee River and along the shore of Lake Erie to the River Raisin. His force consisted of 667 Kentuckians and about 100 local French-speaking Michigan militiamen. On January 18, 1813, Lewis charged across the frozen River Raisin to attack the British and Indian camp, which contained 63 soldiers of the Essex Militia, accompanied by a 3-pounder cannon, and about 200 Potawatomi. A brisk battle took place before the Americans forced the British and their allies to retreat. The Canadians charged the American lines several times, supported by the gunfire of the Indians. Fighting continued sporadically for several hours, with the Canadians and natives fighting log to log, after which Lewis reclaimed Frenchtown. Reynolds' brother commented later that the Essex Militia \\"fought most bravely, retired slowly from log to log.\\" The skirmish has been noted as one of a few examples when Canadian militia stood fast during the war without the backing of British regulars. Kentucky Rifleman William Atherton's memoirs testify to the skill of the Essex men and natives at bush fighting, stating \\"the fight now became very close, and extremely hot ... I received a wound in my right shoulder.\\"{ The moment before Atherton was hit, he witnessed two of his fellow riflemen move too far forward. One was killed and the other wounded. Atherton described the tactics used by Ebenezer Reynolds and his Canadians: \\"Their method was to retreat rapidly until they were out of sight (which was soon the case in the brushy woods) and while we were advancing they were preparing to give us another fire; so we were generally under the necessity of firing upon them as they were retreating.\\" Another Kentucky private had similar recollections: \\"As we advanced they were firing themselves behind logs, trees, etc. to the best advantage.\\" After a long, bloody and exhaustive withdrawal over two miles of woodland, the Canadians and natives slipped away, leaving Frenchtown to the Kentuckians. This skirmish would later be known as the First Battle of the River Raisin. During their retreat from Frenchtown, the Potawatomi raided Sandy Creek, a small settlement founded in 1780 about north of the River Raisin. The Indians burned all 16 houses to the ground, and killed at least two of the town's inhabitants. Sandy Creek was abandoned and never rebuilt. Second Battle of the River Raisin Following the recapture of Frenchtown, US Brigadier General James Winchester and the rest of his troops met with Colonel Lewis two days later on January 20, 1813. Winchester had acted without orders, but General William Henry Harrison was pleased with Lewis's success. However, Harrison was concerned that the British forces might combine and overpower Winchester's small force. He ordered additional men, including three companies of the 17th U.S. Infantry and one company of the 19th U.S. Infantry, to move to Frenchtown. He sent a messenger to Winchester to order him to hold the ground and prepare for further combat. William Harrison (pictured) told Brig Gen James Winchester to hold his ground following the first battle. Harrison and his troops did not arrive in time to participate in the battle. Winchester's soldiers were largely untrained and inexperienced, and the First Battle of the River Raisin was the first combat most had seen. Events showed that Winchester's planning was poor. He had not ensured that ammunition and other necessary supplies were brought forward from the Maumee River. The palisade around the town had not been strengthened, and the regulars of the 17th and 19th U.S. Infantry were camped outside its walls.Elting, p.61 Several days after the first clash, local residents reported to Winchester that a large British force was heading toward Frenchtown. Winchester ignored their warning, insisting it would be \\"some days\\" before the British \\"would be ready to do anything.\\" His troops were camped throughout Frenchtown. Without ensuring that sentries and pickets had been placed, Winchester retired for the night to his headquarters at the Navarre House south of the town. On hearing that the Americans had recaptured Frenchtown, British Brigadier General Henry Procter, commander of the British forces around Detroit, marched with his troops from Fort Malden and crossed the Detroit River from Upper Canada, invading Michigan in strength. His army consisted of 597 regulars from the 41st Regiment of Foot and Royal Newfoundland Fencibles, joined by about 800 Indians. This force linked up with elements of the Essex militia who had fallen back after their initial defeat on January 18. Shawnee leader Tecumseh was in the area, but he was not present at the Battle of Frenchtown. He left command of the Native Americans to Wyandot chiefs Roundhead and Walk-in-the- Water. The Indians included Shawnee, Potawatomi, Ottawa, Chippewa, Delaware, Miami, Winnebago, Creek, Sauk, and Fox tribes.River Raisin National Battlefield Park historic marker Roundhead Procter's artillery consisted of six light 3-pounder cannons drawn on sledges, manned by men from the Canadian Provincial Marine. Procter halted about north of the River Raisin to prepare for battle on January 21. Proctor surprised the American forces before sunrise on January 22. A Canadian volunteer, John Richardson, who had marched with the 41st Regiment of Foot, later wrote, \\"On the 22nd, before daybreak, came within sight of the enemy... such was their security and negligence that... our line was actually half formed within musket shot of their defenses before they were even aware of our presence.\\"River Raisin National Battlefield Park historic marker Battles of the River Raisin Map depicting the positions of American and the British-Native force during the second battle. The American regulars stood their ground for only twenty minutes. These four companies of infantry, consisting mostly of green recruits, were caught in the open. They faced heavy musket volleys to their front, while they were also under direct roundshot and canister fire from the six 3-pounders and flanked by the Essex militia and the Indians. The regulars broke and ran. General Winchester was awakened by the artillery fire and rushed to the battlefield, ordering 240 men from the 1st Kentucky Rifle Regiment under Col. John Allen to reinforce the regulars. Allen's men could not even reach them. Under fire from three sides, the Americans fell into a headlong retreat toward Ohio. They tried to rally three times, but they were eventually surrounded on a narrow road. Almost 220 of the 400 Americans had been killed, many of them shot, tomahawked, and scalped during the withdrawal; 147 men, including Winchester, were captured by the Indians and Canadian militia. Chief Roundhead stripped Winchester of his uniform before he turned him over to the British, which led to a legend that he was captured in his nightshirt. The remaining Americans were scattered and in no position to fight. The 17th's colonel, John Allen, was shot dead and scalped. Dozens had laid down their weapons in surrender, only to be tomahawked by the Indians. Men of the other units also tried to flee; most were run down and killed. A few succeeded in escaping by simply removing their shoes and running in their stockings, which left footprints in the snow that looked like moccasins. Thus they were not followed. British troops occupied a large barn, which was set on fire by William Orlando Butler to force any Americans in hiding from their shelter. Nevertheless, the 1st and 5th Kentucky Rifle Regiments and the 1st Volunteers continued to hold out in Frenchtown. Losing 5 killed and 40 wounded, they had succeeded in taking a heavy toll on the British artillery. Their marksmen had killed or wounded all but one member of the gun crews manning the three cannon in the center of the British line, plus 13 of the 16-man howitzer crew. They had also brought down many infantrymen. Now, however, they were finally running out of ammunition, having repulsed three British assaults. Gen. Proctor demanded Winchester order his remaining men to surrender. Otherwise, all would be killed and Frenchtown burned. Procter insisted on an unconditional surrender and refused Winchester's counter-proposals, since Winchester was already his prisoner. Major George Madison, a United States officer still on the battlefield, persuaded Procter to accept a surrender on the promise that all would be protected as prisoners of war. When they saw the British waving a white flag, the Kentucky riflemen thought it meant a call for a truce. Instead, a British officer handed them a written order from General Winchester to surrender. They refused and decided to fight to the death rather than trust the Indians. After another three hours of fighting, Major Madison issued a formal declaration of surrender.Monroe Co. Historical Commission historic marker The American Surrender Proctor tried several times to persuade the Indians to burn Frenchtown, but the Potawatomi refused to allow this. They had given the land to the settlers and did not wish to inflict more harm on them.River Raisin National Battlefield Park historic marker After the Battle River Raisin Massacre Tecumseh commanded native forces that fought in the battle, although he was not present at the time of the battle or massacre. Immediately after the American surrender, some of the Kentuckians argued with their officers that \\"they would rather die on the field\\" than surrender, fearing that they would be killed by their captors. Still, the fighting ceased immediately following their surrender. At least 300 Americans were estimated as killed, with over 500 taken prisoner. Procter determined on a hasty retreat in case General Harrison sent more troops when he learned of Winchester's defeat. Proctor marched the uninjured prisoners north and across the frozen Detroit River to Fort Malden; the wounded prisoners unable to walk were left behind at Frenchtown. Procter could have waited another day for sleds to arrive to transport the wounded prisoners, but he worried that more American soldiers were on the way from the south. On the morning of January 23, the Native Americans began robbing the injured Americans in Frenchtown. Any prisoner who could walk at all was marched toward Fort Malden; those more severely injured were left behind, and the Native Americans killed them. The Native Americans also set fire to the buildings that housed the wounded. Prisoners who escaped from the burning buildings were killed; the rest died in the flames. As the Potowatomie marched prisoners north toward Detroit, they killed any who could not keep up. According to an account from a survivor, \\"The road was for miles strewed with the mangled bodies.\\" Estimates of the numbers of wounded killed by Indians range from a low of 30 to as many as 100. The slaughter of the American wounded on January 23 became known as the River Raisin Massacre. It so horrified Americans that it overshadowed the battle, and news of the massacre spread throughout the country. The massacre was devastating for the state of Kentucky, which had supplied most of the soldiers for the campaign. Kentucky lost many of its leading citizens in either the battle or the subsequent massacre. The rallying cry \\"Remember the River Raisin\\" or \\"Remember the Raisin!\\" led many more Kentuckians to enlist for the war. Aftermath While it is not known how many soldiers died during the First Battle of the River Raisin on January 18, 1813, Eaton's Compilation lists 397 Americans killed and 27 wounded during the January 22 conflict. Also, figures for those who were killed during the subsequent River Raisin Massacre are unknown, but estimates are as high as 100 killed. Two weeks after the battle, Brigadier General James Winchester reported that 547 of his men were taken as prisoners and only 33 escaped the battlefield. Many of those who were held as prisoners were detained at Fort Malden by the British until the end of the war over two years later. Winchester was imprisoned for more than a year before being released and reassigned to military service. Brig Gen James Winchester largely bore the responsibility for the devastating loss at Frenchtown. James Winchester largely bore the responsibility for the devastating loss at Frenchtown. His ill-prepared defensive planning following the successful First Battle of the River Raisin led to the defeat of his army and the high number of deaths suffered by his column. Had Winchester retreated to the Maumee River to rejoin with General Harrison's column, the two could have strengthened their numbers and marched back to Frenchtown with the necessary troops and preparedness to fight the British and Native Americans. Instead, Winchester remained in Frenchtown with his small force despite advanced knowledge of a British and Native American counterattack. He was unaware that Harrison's troops were on their way and would arrive shortly. During the Second Battle of the River Raisin, Winchester was captured early in the battle and surrendered his army at the urging of British Brigadier General Henry Procter. While Winchester's army suffered heavy losses at the start of the surprise attack, the Kentuckians regrouped and fought off three waves of British lines to protect their camp. They were very low on ammunition when the order of surrender came from Winchester. Had the Americans prolonged the battle long enough for Harrison's column to arrive at Frenchtown, the outcome of the battle could have changed. The British reported casualties of 24 killed and 161 wounded; Native American casualties are not known to have been documented. Immediately following the battle, Procter, fearing that General Harrison would send more Americans to Frenchtown, made a hasty retreat slightly north to Brownstown. Harrison was forced to call off his plans for a winter campaign to retake Detroit. The city was held by the British until a United States victory at the Battle of Lake Erie on September 10, 1813 allowed the recapture of Detroit. Frenchtown was held as a stronghold by the British until Colonel Richard Mentor Johnson from Kentucky led his cavalry to liberate the town on September 27, 1813. The retreating British were pushed back into Upper Canada, where they were defeated at the Battle of the Thames on October 5. Three active battalions of the Regular Army (1-3 Inf, 2-3 Inf and 4-3 Inf) perpetuate the lineage of the old 17th and 19th Infantry Regiments, both of which had elements in action during fighting at Frenchtown.

In addition, the state of Michigan erected a monument in downtown Monroe in 1904. The monument is located on the west side of South Monroe Street (M-125) at the corner of 7th Street. Also, on this site were interred the unidentified remains of some of the victims of the battle or massacre. The core area where the battle took place was listed as a Michigan Historic Site on February 18, 1956. The location of the site is bounded by North Dixie Highway, the River Raisin, Detroit Avenue, and Mason Run Creek. The site was recognized nationally when it was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 10, 1982. The River Raisin National Battlefield Park was authorized on March 30, 2009 with the passing of the Omnibus Public Land Management Act, and funded later that year. It is one of four National Battlefield Parks in the United States, and the only one to commemorate the War of 1812.

U.S. Navy The Navy Recruit Honor Graduate Ribbon was created on 18 August 2015, when U.S. Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus released a statement authorizing the establishment of the Recruit Honor Graduate Ribbon. This ribbon is awarded to \\"initial accession enlisted personnel of the U.S. Navy who are designated as Honor Graduates.\\" No more than three percent of each training group will be designated as honor graduates. Fifteen recruits from Recruit Division 281 at Recruit Training Command (RTC), Naval Station Great Lakes, Illinois, were first awarded the ribbon on 20 August 2015. No retroactive awards will be made. In the Navy's military award order of precedence, the ribbon is worn after the Navy Ceremonial Guard Ribbon and before the Armed Forces Reserve Medal. Seaman Recruit Joseph Agbingpadua was the first recruit to receive the ribbon. U.S. Air Force The Air Force Basic Military Training Honor Graduate Ribbon was established on 3 April 1976 by order of the Air Force Chief of Staff, General David Charles Jones. The ribbon is awarded to graduates of Air Force basic training who have obtained an honor graduate designation and demonstrate excellence in all areas of academic and military training. An airman must achieve at least a 90% on his/her physical fitness level during the final AFBMT physical fitness test. The AFBMT physical fitness test has four parts: 1.5-mile run time (60%), number of sit ups in a minute (10%), number of push ups in a minute (10%), and waist measurement (20%). If the trainee fails to reach a score of at least 90%, the airman is ineligible no matter how well he or she performed in other areas of basic training. Additionally, the airman must average over a 90 percent on all the written examinations, and never fail a graded inspection (graded inspections are conducted randomly after week #3). The airman must never receive a negative mark in a written evaluation. Current regulations limit the number of selectees to no more than ten percent of the graduating squadron. The U.S. Air Force Basic Military Training Honor Graduate Ribbon is a one-time award and may not be presented retroactively. Those awarded are entitled to wear the Air Force Basic Training Honor Graduate Ribbon for the rest of their U.S. Air Force careers. U.S. Coast Guard The Coast Guard Basic Training Honor Graduate Ribbon was created on 3 March 1984, with the first presentation in April of that same year to Seaman apprentice Scott Woodard. The Basic Training Honor Graduate Ribbon is presented to the service member who graduates at the top of their basic training instruction class. Retroactive presentations of the Basic Training Honor Graduate Ribbon may be awarded upon application from the service member to the United States Coast Guard. In such cases, the award will be presented for basic training graduation prior to 1984, only with supporting documentation and a written request from the service member.

He was titled as \\"Mewari Rana\\" and has been for his powerful resistance of his kingdom of Mewar from Mughal Emperor Akbar till his death in the year 1597. Early life and accession Maharana Pratap was born in a Hindu Rajput family. He was born to Udai Singh II and Jaiwanta Bai. His younger brothers were Shakti Singh, Vikram Singh and Jagmal Singh. Pratap also had 2 stepsisters: Chand Kanwar and Man Kanwar. He was married to Ajabde Punwar of Bijolia and he had married 10 other women and was survived by 17 children including Amar Singh I. He belonged to the Royal Family of Mewar. After the death of Udai Singh in 1572, Rani Dheer Bai wanted her son Jagmal to succeed him but senior courtiers preferred Pratap, as the eldest son, to be their king. The desire of the nobles prevailed. Udai Singh died in 1572, and Prince Pratap ascended the throne as Maharana Pratap, the 54th ruler of Mewar in the line of the Sisodia Rajputs. Jagmal swore revenge and left for Ajmer, to join the armies of Akbar, and obtained a jagir - the town of Jahazpur - in return for his help. Battle of Haldighati The bloody Siege of Chittorgarh in 1567-1568 had led to the loss of the fertile eastern belt of Mewar to the Mughals. However, the rest of the wooded and hilly kingdom in the Aravalli range was still under the control of Pratap Singh. The Mughal emperor Akbar was intent on securing a stable route to Gujarat through Mewar; when Pratap Singh was crowned king (Maharana) in 1572, Akbar sent a number of envoys entreating him to become a vassal like many other Rajput leaders in the region. When the Maharana refused to personally submit to Akbar, war became inevitable. The Battle of Haldighati was fought on 18 June 1576 between Pratap Singh and Akbar's forces led by Man Singh I of Amer. The Mughals were victorious and inflicted significant casualties among the Mewaris but failed to capture the Maharana. The site of the battle was a narrow mountain pass at Haldighati near Gogunda, modern day Rajsamand in Rajasthan. Pratap Singh fielded a force of around 3000 cavalry and 400 Bhil archers. The Mughals were led by Man Singh of Amber, who commanded an army numbering around 5000‚Äì10,000 men. After a fierce battle lasting more than six hours, the Maharana found himself wounded and the day lost. He managed to escape to the hills and lived to fight another day. Haldighati was a futile victory for the Mughals, as they were unable to capture Pratap Singh, or any of his close family members in Udaipur. As soon as the empire's focus shifted north-west, Pratap and his army came out of hiding and recaptured the western regions of his dominion. Reconquest of Mewar Mughal pressure on Mewar relaxed after 1579 following rebellions in Bengal and Bihar and Mirza Hakim's incursion into the Punjab. In 1582, Pratap Singh attacked and occupied the Mughal post at Dewair (or Dawer). This led to the automatic liquidation of all 36 Mughal military outposts in Mewar. After this defeat, Akbar stopped his military campaigns against Mewar. The victory of Dewair was a crowning glory for the Maharana, with James Tod describing it as the \\"Marathon of Mewar\\". In 1585, Akbar moved to Lahore and remained there for the next twelve years watching the situation in the north- west. No major Mughal expedition was sent to Mewar during this period. Taking advantage of the situation, Pratap recovered Western Mewar including Kumbhalgarh, Udaipur and Gogunda. During this period, he also built a new capital, Chavand, near modern Dungarpur. Death Reportedly, Pratap died of injuries sustained in a hunting accident, at Chavand on 19 January 1597, aged 56. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Amar Singh I. On his death bed, Pratap told his son never to submit to the Mughals and to win Chittor back. Legacy There are a lot of places and destinations named after his name and he has been noted many a times in films and television serials as a potrait of bravery and velegiance. He was known to develop the Guerrilla warfare techniques and was known to be the only Rajput ruler who refused to bow infront of Akbar and Mughal armies. He lived in forest with his army refusing the royalty and beside Rajput warrior his army consisted of warrior of every caste and religions including Bhil people and Muslim including his Afghan Pathan army chief Hakim Khan Sur. He is considered as the bravest and best Rajput king in the history of India.

The song first appeared as the final studio track on the Allman Brothers Band's fourth album, Eat a Peach, released in 1972. The track was recorded in October 1971, a few weeks before Duane Allman's death in a motorcycle accident. Allman's original recording of the song is a bouncy fingerstyle acoustic guitar instrumental duet with minimal accompaniment. Allman and bandmate Dickey Betts played the tune on 6-string guitars using open E tuning. The song's simple melody and rhythmic counterpoint quickly made it a favorite among fans; acoustic guitar virtuoso Leo Kottke, who often covered the song in performance, once called it \\"the most perfect guitar song ever written.\\" Song Origin The story goes that Allman had a dream where Jimi Hendrix showed him the melody of the tune in a Holiday Inn motel bathroom, using the sink faucet as a guitar fretboard. Remembering the melody during the October 1971 sessions that produced most of the third side of what would become Eat a Peach, Allman laid down the track, joined only by Dicky Betts and bassist Berry Oakley, though Oakley's part would be mixed out of the final version, leaving the number as a duet for the two guitarists. (Oakley's part would be restored on the 1989 box set Dreams.) alt=Grey stone statue of a 12 year old girl with shoulder-length hair. It is commonly believed that the song's namesake was Martha Ellis, a twelve-year-old girl whose grave the Allman Brothers Band most likely came across during their frequent trips to Rose Hill Cemetery in their homebase of Macon, Georgia. The approximate geographic coordinates of the statue are 32¬∞50'55.55\\"N, 83¬∞38'2.21\\"W.(Both Duane Allman himself and Berry Oakley would be buried there by the end of 1972). However, as with Dicky Betts' 1970 instrumental \\"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed\\", the song seems to have been named for one person, while actually being about someone else. Little Martha was envisioned by Allman as an ode to his then-girlfriend Dixie Meadows. He had given her the pet name of Martha because of the vintage clothing she sometimes wore - Duane saying \\"you look like Martha Washington.\\" After Allman's death, Meadows sued unsuccessfully for control of his estate. Longevity and cover versions Both Gregg Allman and Dicky Betts have included \\"Little Martha\\" on live albums. It appears in a wildly different electric version as the opening track to Dicky Betts' 2004 limited-release live album, Instant Live At The Odeon. On Allman's 1974 effort, The Gregg Allman Tour, the studio version can be heard faintly on the PA system after the closing track, \\"Will The Circle Be Unbroken\\". It was also interwoven into bassist Oteil Burbridge's bass solos during certain live shows in the late 1990s by The Allman Brothers Band. Pickin' On The Allman Brothers: A Bluegrass Tribute contains a 3:40 min version of \\"Little Martha\\" Key Signature & Composition Little Martha is in the key of E Major, and the guitars are tuned in an Open E Tuning (E-B- E-G#-B-E). The song has occasionally been recorded by other instrumentalists in the decades since its original release, including notable versions by guitarists Leo Kottke, and dobro virtuoso Jerry Douglas. The song is played over the PA system after every Allman Brothers Band show as a tribute to Duane Allman. From roughly 1985-2005, Little Martha, along with Stevie Ray Vaughan's \\"Stang's Swang\\", was played on Kentucky Educational Television during a scroll of significant sponsors at the end of the broadcast day.

He was accepted into the school's medical program, but instead chose to try a career in the entertainment industry. Around 1968, Godard worked three jobs at the same time while living in Macon, Georgia: analyzing electroplating solutions at Maxson Electronics; acting as a news anchor and \\"stand-up weatherman\\" for WMAZ-TV; and as a licensed pilot for Lowe Aviation. He served as a production assistant at WMAZ radio in 1970.http://billeldervoiceovers.com/radio/wmaz.htm Career During the early 1980s, Godard had roles in the made-for-TV movie Guyana Tragedy: The Story of Jim Jones and the TBS soap opera The Caitlins.IMDb credits page for Joel Godard. In the 1980s and 1990s, Godard made voiceover appearances on Saturday Night Live, NBC Nightly News, and Issues and Answers. Around 1986, he became an NBC staff announcer. Godard was the voice of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade from 2000 to 2011. In 2014, he starred in a series of online comedy shorts by Turtle with Lemonade Productions, entitled \\"Little Known Moments in American History.\\" Late Night with Conan O'Brien Godard joined Late Night with Conan O'Brien when it was launched in 1993. He frequently appeared in sketches, often pretending to be a suicidal homosexual filled with self-loathing, and with a penchant for bizarre sex acts, substance abuse, and \\"young Asian men (preferably wearing Speedos)\\".

Waskaganish is part of the territory referred to as \\"Eeyou Istchee\\" (\\"The Land of the People\\" in Cree) encompassing the traditional territories of Cree people in the James Bay regions of what is now Northern Quebec and Ontario. The community of Waskaganish celebrated its 350-year anniversary in 2018. The village is located at the site of the former Fort Rupert, the first Hudson's Bay Company trading post on Hudson Bay. History=Pre-contact According to a study on aboriginal fur trade, Cree hunting groups of three or four families moved from traditional seasonal fishing and hunting camps. They often stayed close to watersheds. In 2012, a local resident of Waskaganish found rough-looking stone blades and arrowheads at the Saunders Goose Pond on Waskaganish territory that could be between 4,000 and 7,000 years old. In 2012 archaeological teams were digging near the Smokey Hill rapids about 20 kilometres from Waskaganish, a traditional weir fishing site where families have gathered annually in late summer for generations. Prior to construction of the hydroelectric project and the partial diversion of the Rupert River which exposed the shoreline, the natural current forced fish into the weir. After the diversion, scoop-net fishing pools were unusable. By 2011 there were larger concentrations of cisco at Gravel Pit, they were smaller than previous years. Pre-contact trade relations between Cree and other aboriginal groups were \\"mostly centered on trading moose hides for ‚Äòcereals‚Äô, ‚Äòindian corn‚Äô, and tobacco.\\" There was a pre-contact intertribal Cree-Montagnais trade route from Waskaganish to the Saint Lawrence River via Rupert River and the Saguenay River. Post-contact It was hypothesized that Henry Hudson's fateful over-wintering in 1610-1611 was in Waskaganish territory. In 1610 Hudson had reached what is now the Hudson Strait but by November his new ship, Discovery, had become icebound in James Bay and they were forced to move ashore. A map of Hudson's fourth voyageOn 29 September 1668, Nonsuch, under the command of Zachariah Gillam and guided by M√©dard des Groseilliers, anchored at the mouth of the Rupert River. In 1668, Rupert House or Charles Fort at Waskaganish on the south bank of Rupert River, was established as the first trading post, two years before the Hudson's Bay Company was formed. In October 1669 they returned to England with a load of beaver pelts they had acquired from the Cree people in exchange for good such as knives, kettles, beads, needles and blankets. The post was occupied sporadically thereafter and new buildings were added. By the 1680s there were a string of trading posts on James Bay Cree traditional land and the Cree had an extensive trade alliance with the HBC. As middlemen, the Cree hunters, trappers and traders collected furs from other First Nations in the interior. As the first trappers with the HBC, the Cree became the homeguard for the HBC, helping with the supply and maintenance of the trading posts in winter. In 1670-1679 Charles Bayly was governor. In 1672 Charles Albanel reached Charles Fort from the Saint Lawrence. Finding all the English out hunting, he waited a week, left a letter, and returned to Quebec. In 1674 Albanel reached the fort again and was sent to England. In 1681, fearing French attack, a new Charles Fort was built downstream on a hill top. In 1686 the French captured the fort and burned it. In 1688 the English tried to re-establish the fort, but D'Iberville captured it again, this time from the sea. For the next century the east coast of James Bay was visited by HBC ships from Fort Albany, Ontario. In 1776 the site was re-occupied and named Rupert House or Rupert Fort or Fort Rupert. From then until the early 1900s, Fort Rupert was an important trading location, supplying inland communities and other posts via the Rupert River with regular canoe brigades. In 1991 the archaeologist J. V. Chism found the sites of the two Charles Forts. The first was at the site of the new tourist lodge (Auberge Kanio Kashee Lodge) and the second at the Anglican church. Manager's house and other buildings, Rupert House, circa 1921  Modern history The James Bay Project and the James Bay Northern Quebec Agreement (JBNQA)= Life for the Cree people of Waskaganish and Eeyou Istchee was greatly impacted by The James Bay Project. Although the project was celebrated by mainstream media as \\"The Project of the Century\\", Cree people had not agreed to its construction. In fact, they had not been consulted at all, nor were they made aware of the project's existence until construction had already begun. One major point of contention had to do with land use rights. The land surrounding James Bay had been the traditional territory of Cree and Inuit people for thousands of years. Compared to other areas of Canada, where treaties had been established that (at least in theory) clarified indigenous peoples' and European settlers' rights to land, no such agreements had ever been established in Eeyou Istchee. As such, the stakeholders in the James Bay Project (Hydro Quebec and the Government of Quebec) had no established legal right to the land on which they had already begun constructing the largest hydro-electric project ever built. In response to the project, the Cree people formed the Grand Council of the Crees and elected Billy Diamond as Grand Chief to represent the people of Eeyou Istchee in dealings with the Quebec Government. In addition to land use rights, the Cree expressed concerns about irreparable damage to the environment, destruction of traditional hunting and fishing areas, and impacts on the traditional Cree way of life. Ultimately the Cree people of Eeyou Istchee and the Grand Council were unable to prevent the construction of the dam. However, through negotiations, they established the historic James Bay Northern Quebec Agreement (JBNQA) which contained provisions about land use, economic development, self-governance of indigenous peoples, and funding for cultural, social, and health services for beneficiaries. Although there was initial difficulties in getting the treaty obligations ratified, funding related to the JBNQA allowed for significant improvements in living conditions for Cree communities, such as creation of water and sewer systems. It also led to the creation of the Cree Board of Health and Social Services of James Bay (CBHSSJB) and the Cree School Board (CSB). = Road access = Waskaganish became accessible by road in 2001, when a gravel access road connected the community to the James Bay Road. Prior to 2001, the community was only accessible by airplane or boat.  Notable people from Waskaganish  Billy Diamond was both the chief of the Waskaganish Cree starting in 1970 and the Grand Chief of the Grand Council of the Crees of Eeyou Istchee. Filmmaker Neil Diamond was born and raised in Waskaganish. His experiences as a child there, watching Westerns with other local children in the church basement, inspired him to make Reel Injun.

From its headwaters in Lake Mistassini, the largest natural lake in Quebec, it flows west into Rupert Bay on James Bay. The Rupert drains an area of . There is some extremely large whitewater on the river, but paddlers can avoid much of it by portage routes on the side. The most impressive falls, which cannot be avoided except by portaging, are the \\"Oatmeal Rapids\\" right at the James Bay Road (a set of cascades dropping ) and \\"The Fours\\" near the end of the river (a drop). The Rupert has long been an important river for the Cree of the area. Every year, a group of Cree youth from the village of Waskaganish, at the mouth of the Rupert, travel up the river to Lake Nemiscau. Major tributaries of the Rupert are (in downstream order): * Natastan River (Rivi√®re Natastan) * Lemare River (Rivi√®re Lemare) - subbasin * Marten River (Rivi√®re √† la Marte) - subbasin * Nemiscau River (Rivi√®re Nemiscau) - subbasin History In 1668, an expedition led by M√©dard des Groseilliers came to the mouth of the Rupert River in order to bypass French controlled areas along the St. Lawrence River and in doing so, trying to break the French hold on the fur trade. They named the river after the sponsor of the expedition, Prince Rupert.\\"Rivers of the World: the Rupert in Canada\\", Radio Netherlands Archives, January 31, 2003 A fort (originally called Fort Charles) was established at the mouth of the river, which later became the trading post Rupert House, the oldest trading post of the Hudson's Bay Company. From then on, the Rupert River played a vital role in supplying inland trading posts (such as Nemiscau and Mistissini) with regular canoe brigades, right until the beginning of the twentieth century when supplies started to come from the south via rail and later road. While having lost its importance as a trade route, the Rupert River has long been a popular destination for recreational canoe camping and whitewater canoeing. Hydroelectric development The Oatmeal Rapids on the Rupert River. The Rupert, together with the Nottaway and Broadback rivers, was initially considered to be dammed and diverted as part of the James Bay Project. But in 1972, hydro-electric development began on the more northerly La Grande and Eastmain rivers, and the NBR Project was shelved. The plan to divert the Rupert's headwaters into the La Grande hydroelectric complex was revived in 2002 when a landmark agreement between the Government of Quebec and the Grand Council of the Crees was signed. In this agreement, known as La Paix des braves (literally \\"Peace of the Brave\\"), the two parties agreed to authorize the completion of a long-delayed hydroelectric project on the Eastmain River, just to the north of the Rupert River. A subsequent agreement in April 2004 put an end to all litigation between the two parties and opening the way to the joint environmental assessment of the diversion of about 50% of the total water flow of the Rupert River (and 70% at the diversion point) northwards to the Eastmain River and into the La Grande hydroelectric watershed. The Grand Chief of the Crees, Matthew Mukash , elected in late 2005, opposed the Rupert diversion project, preferring the development of wind turbines in the region. After completion of the joint environmental assessments by the Cree, Quebec and Canadian authorities, the governments of Quebec and Canada authorized the diversion and construction of hydroelectric installations on the Rupert River in late 2006. The diversion of water from the river began in November, 2009. or 68% of its basin will be diverted through a long transfer tunnel from the Rupert Forebay to the Rupert Tailbay in the Nemiscau basin and then onward to the Eastmain 1 Reservoir.

The site is near the city of Marion, Indiana. Today, the location is the site of Mississinewa 1812, the largest War of 1812 reenactment in the United States, which is held every October. The annual festival draws thousands of visitors from all over the world. In 2004, a large memorial was unveiled and is currently on display near the Mississinewa River in downtown Marion.http://www.mississinewa1812.com/ Expedition After receiving permission from Secretary of War William Eustis, Harrison ordered Lieutenant Colonel John B. Campbell to lead an expedition into Indiana. Campbell's objective was to destroy the Miami villages along the Mississinewa River. If possible, he was to avoid harm to Miami chiefs Pacanne, Jean Baptiste Richardville, White Loon, or Lenape Chief Silver Heel. Campbell's force of 600 mounted troops departed from Fort Greenville on December 14 and traveled 80 miles (130 km) and reached Silver Heel's village on December 17 and took 42 Lenape prisoners.Rafert, 75 The mounted force then moved down the Mississinewa River, attacking at least two Miami villages. The Indians were taken by surprise and had not evacuated. A large number of Miami were killed, and 76 were taken prisoner, including 34 women and children. Later that day, having accomplished his objective, Campbell considered returning to Fort Greenville on account of severe frostbite among his troops. The next morning, December 18, as Campbell returned to Silver Heel's village, a sizeable Native American force counterattacked. The American Indians were outnumbered, but fought fiercely to rescue the captured villagers being held by Campbell. A joint cavalry charge led by Major James McDowell and Captains Trotter and Johnston finally broke the attack.Allison, 224 The American loss was 8 killed and 48 wounded (of whom 4 later died). Campbell claimed that 8 Indians were killed on December 17 and that at least 30 were killed on December 18. 8 warriors and thirty-four women and children were captured. One of the captured villagers told Campbell that Tecumseh was nearby and was coming with hundreds of men, so Campbell began the return march to Fort Greenville, taking with him the 42 prisoners.This was not an idle threat; Tecumseh was rapidly approaching with 600 men, intent on destroying the U.S. force. Allison, 226 It was a costly victory. During the return trek, the American force was plagued greatly by frostbite, and by the time they reached Fort Greenville on December 28, some 300 of Campbell's troops were suffering from frostbite and rendered unfit for duty. An entire regiment, under Colonel Simrale, was disbanded due to frostbite.Allison, 227 Aftermath The Indian force was only concerned with protecting their lives and winter food supplies. In order to ensure this, they needed to stop Cambell's expedition and force it to return to its base, which they did. Harrison claimed the expedition as a victory because of the prisoners that were taken, and he contemplated sending another expedition down the Mississinewa despite the fact that over half his cavalry was incapacitated either from battle wounds or frostbite. Harrison received approval and appointed Campbell a full colonel in the Regular Army. Harrison ordered another attack on the Mississinewa villages the following July. Although crops and houses were again destroyed, the Miami had evacuated and escaped further casualties. Three active battalions of the Regular Army (1-3 Inf, 2-3 Inf and 4-3 Inf) perpetuate the lineages of the old 19th Infantry Regiment, which had elements that participated in the Battle of the Mississinewa.

Origin The variety of orange chicken most commonly found at North American Chinese restaurants consists of chopped, battered and fried chicken pieces coated in a sweet orange-flavored chili sauce, which thickens or caramelizes to a glaze. While the dish is very popular in the United States, it is most often found as a variation of General Tso's chicken in North America rather than the dish found in mainland China. Chef Andy Kao claims to have developed the original Chinese-American orange chicken recipe at a Panda Express in Hawaii in 1987. Since Panda Express is closely associated with this dish, Panda Express uses orange chicken as a promotion tool by having a dedicated food truck tour the country distributing samples of orange chicken. Though called Chinese food in North America, orange chicken is rarely found in Chinese restaurants in China. Andrew Cherng, owner and founder of Panda Express, said that orange chicken is just a variation of General Tso's chicken, another dish that is almost unknown in China. Journalist Jennifer 8. Lee says that both \\"General Tso's chicken and Orange Chicken are Americanized mutations of sweet and sour dishes found in China.\\" Orange chicken has also entered the menus of the mainstream U.S. by being served in school cafeterias, and in military bases' chow halls, and also found in the supermarket frozen meal aisle. Variations In most countries in the western hemisphere, the names \\"orange chicken\\", \\"orange peel chicken\\", \\"orange-flavoured chicken\\", and \\"tangerine chicken\\" are typically used for this particular dish. In Chinese, this dish is known as \\"Ê©ôËä±Èõû\\", literally \\"(fresh) orange peel chicken\\". The dish also has a variation known as \\"Èô≥ÁöÆÈõû\\", literally \\"dried citrus peel chicken\\", referring to dried orange or tangerine peel, which is used in traditional Chinese medicine as well as cooking. For restaurants outside of Asia, fresh orange peel is often used instead, or even no peel at all.

Situated in Ras Hafun on the coast of the Guardafui Channel, it is the centre of the Hafun District, and the easternmost town in continental Africa. It is an ancient town previously known as Opone. History 17th century masjid in Hafun. Hafun has been identified as the ancient trading port of Opone, which was described in the 1st century CE Greek travelogue the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea. Pottery found by an expedition led by Neville Chittick, in Oponean tombs at Damo, date back to the Mycenaean kingdom of Greece that flourished between the 16th century BC. Merchants from as far afield as Indonesia and Malaysia in the Far East also passed through the settlement. By the 50 CE, the area was well known as a centre for the cinnamon trade, along with the barter of cloves and other spices, ivory, exotic animal hides, and incense. It also traded in tortoiseshells. During the early modern period, Hafun was a part of the Majeerteen Sultanate's realm. In 1930, an Italian firm invested capital to exploit salt deposits in Hafun and Hurdiyo. The Italians renamed the city Dante and created the biggest salt production plant in the world.Italian cities of Banadir By 1933 or 1934, the Hafun salt works were producing more than 200,000 metric tonnes of salt, most of which was exported to the Far East. Following independence in 1960, the town was made the centre of the official Hafun District. Demographics As of 2000, Hafun had a population of around 13,200 inhabitants. Education Hafun has a number of academic institutions. According to the Puntland Ministry of Education, there are 8 primary schools in the Hafun District. Among these are Hurdiya, Laamiye, Gardush and Xandha. Economy The Hafun Salt Factory, built in the 1930s. The Hafun Fishing Company was established in July 1992, in Bosaso. It was named after Hafun, where HFC also has an office. The firm exports a wide range of fish products to international markets. Among these are lobsters, frozen fish, dried shark meat and fin, which it mainly sends to Yemen, the United Arab Emirates and Oman in the Persian Gulf, as well as some products to Kenya in the African Great Lakes' region. The company is exploring additional global markets for its fish goods. In late 2014, the Udug Ltd. Company, in conjunction with the United States-based REDD Engineering & Construction Incorporation, began conducting feasibility studies for the renovation of the salt production plants in Hafun, Hurdiyo, and other littoral areas in Puntland. The first phase of the initiative was completed in March 2015 and saw the historic salt works in both towns refurbished following community-wide consultations. According to the Puntland Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation, the project focuses on stimulating entrepreneurship and sustaining job creation. It was inspired by calls for national reinvestment by the Puntland presidential office and the Puntland Chamber of Commerce. Additionally, Redd Engineering official Lowry Redd indicated that the initiative's second phase aims to make the Hafun plant again one of the main global suppliers of salt. Transportation In 2012, the Puntland Highway Authority (PHA) announced a project to connect Hafun and other littoral towns in Puntland to the main regional highway. The thoroughfare, which is long, links major cities in the northern part of Somalia, such as Bosaso, Galkayo and Garowe, with towns in the south.

Jutting out into the Guardafui Channel, it constitutes the easternmost point in Africa. The area is situated near the Cape Guardafui headland. It is joined to the mainland at the town of Foar, by a sand spit long, in width, and above sea level. The fishing town of Hafun is located on the promontory, east of the sand spit. Ras Hafun and its line of latitude separate the Guardafui Channel to its north, from the Somali Sea to its south. History=Antiquity and Middle Ages 17th-century Masjid in Hafun. Ras Hafun is home to numerous ancient structures and ruins. The peninsula is believed to be the location of the old trade emporium of Opone. The latter is mentioned in the anonymous Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, written in the first century CE. Opone is described therein as a busy port city, strategically located on the trade route that spanned the length of the Indian Ocean's rim. Merchants from as far afield as Indonesia and Malaysia passed through the settlement. As early as 50 CE, the area was well known as a center for the cinnamon trade, along with the barter of cloves and other spices, ivory, exotic animal skins and incense. In the 1970s, a Somali-British archaeological expedition in Hafun and other parts of northern Somalia, led by Neville Chittick, recovered numerous examples of historical artefacts and structures, including ancient coins, Roman pottery, drystone buildings, cairns, masjids, walled enclosures, standing stones and platform monuments. Many of the finds were of pre-Islamic origin and associated with city-states and trading centers described in ancient documents. The Damo site, in particular, was suggested by Chittick to correspond with the Periplus' \\"Market and Cape of Spices\\". Some of the smaller artefacts that the company found were subsequently deposited for preservation at the British National Museum. A later expedition in Hafun, led by an archaeological team with the University of Michigan, excavated Ancient Egyptian, Roman and Persian Gulf pottery. In the 1980s, the British Institute in Eastern Africa also recovered pre-Islamic Partho-Sassanid ceramics from the peninsula, which were dated to the first century BCE and the second through fifth centuries CE.Paul J. J. Sinclair, \\"Archaeology in Eastern Africa: An Overview of Current Chronological Issues\\", Journal of African History, 32 (1991), p. 181 Archaeological excavations at the western Hafun site have yielded ceramics from ancient kingdoms in the Nile Valley, Near East, Persia and Mesopotamia, as well as some sherds of possible derivation from the Indian subcontinent. Among this ware is a late Ptolemaic lamp fragment, Parthian glazed sherds, and Hellenistic lagynos wares. Smith and Wright have dated the finds to sometime between the 1st century BCE and the early first century CE. Additionally, some ceramics affiliated with green glazed ware from Sohar on the Omani littoral have also been found in the area. These pieces have been dated to between the 1st century BC and the 5th century BCE. Hafun is also home to an ancient necropolis.

The player takes the role of Maximillian Remington (or his female counterpart, Maxine), a skilled and deadly free agent hired by CIA, investigating on-going criminal and terrorist activities. Tommo purchased the rights to this game and digitally publishes it through its Retroism brand in 2015. Gameplay The gameplay is similar to the 1987 release Pirates!, by the same developer, Sid Meier, in that the gameplay is made up of several self-directed, distinct, and unique modes of play. The controls are relatively simple and uniform, and the sound and graphics, for the period, are widely considered at or above par. During the course of a game, the player will be tasked with installing wiretaps, infiltrating enemy safehouses, intercepting and decoding secret messages and interrogating prisoners. The plots are uniformly without distinction, as is to be expected with randomly generated text-based plot elements. This allows for a less structured story to unfold, and enhances the game's replayability. The game is broken down into missions, with players possibly receiving promotions after each successful mission. The primary goal of each mission is to uncover details about a criminal conspiracy involving multiple parties. Players must race against the clock to discover the identities of those involved and their roles in the plot before it's too late. For example, the case might begin with blueprints being stolen for a museum. The blueprints might then be delivered from this party to another thief, who might then use them to break into a museum to steal a painting, which might then be delivered to yet another party. If the player takes too much time to uncover the details of the plan, the plot will go down successfully and the criminals will escape. Many of the pieces of data which the player needs are gathered through various mini-games. Successfully completing a mini-game often reveals one or more pieces of data, including the names and photos of those involved, as well as locations connected to the plot. The player is allowed to decide which skills his agent has mastered ahead of time, making the associated mini-games easier. The longest mini-game involves attempting to directly infiltrate an enemy building. Before going in, players are allowed to select their equipment, including guns, various types of grenades, and body armor. Once inside, players search desks, safes, and cabinets for clues; these are photographed using a small camera. Players also frequently confront enemy agents, who must be avoided, slain or knocked unconscious. In some cases, if the timing is right, players can find and recover major pieces of evidence (such as a stolen item). If the character runs out of health, he or she is knocked unconscious and must either lose precious time escaping, or agree to a prisoner exchange by freeing captured enemy agents. During the cryptography mini-game, players attempt to decode a scrambled message within a certain period of time. Players are frequently given certain known letters to begin with, but must then figure out the remaining letter mappings in a simple substitution cipher. Use of existing clues from the ongoing investigation is often key to solving these, e.g., searching for a word which could be \\"Washington\\" when it is known that the plot is taking place there. The driving mini-game may involve either the player tailing a suspect to discover a new location, or the player fleeing from chase cars in order to avoid a confrontation. Cars are represented by small dots on maze-like streets. Players use a simple interface to control speed and direction Electronics in the game involves the manipulation of circuit boards to either perform wiretapping or vehicle tracing. In the wiretapping mini-game, players attempt to either cut or to connect current flowing through a set of power lines to a number of phone icons, in order to listen in to conversations. At the same time, players must avoid disturbing the lines connected to alarms. The game is played by re-arranging the junctions through which power flows to produce the desired results. Development Sid Meier was reportedly dissatisfied with the final product, because he believed that the disparate elements of the game, however good they were individually, detracted from game play.

To be eligible to earn the Seabee Combat Warfare Specialist insignia, personnel must first be assigned to a qualifying unit of the Naval Construction Force (Seabees) such as Naval Construction Groups (NCG), Naval Construction Regiments (NCR), Naval Mobile Construction Battalions (NMCB), Underwater Construction Teams (UCT), and Construction Battalion Maintenance Units (CBMU), as well as personnel assigned to Amphibious Construction Battalions (ACB). As such, qualification is primarily earned by enlisted members of the Seabee Occupational Field ratings and members of the Civil Engineer Corps, however the insignia may be earned by any officer or enlisted member assigned to a qualifying unit having completed the prescribed requirements. To be awarded the insignia, a service member must demonstrate superior proficiency in naval heritage, naval doctrine, command and control, hazardous material/hazardous waste environmental safety, supply & logistics, communications and communications security, weapons, general military tactics, contingency operations, embarkation, safety, basic first aid, civil engineer support equipment, and chemical, biological, and radiological warfare. In addition to preparatory coursework, personnel are required to complete Personal Qualification Standards (PQS) common to all qualifying units as well as a PQS specific to the type unit assigned. Officers are required to complete an officer specific PQS in addition to all aspects of the enlisted program as well as demonstrate broad and deep knowledge proficiency commensurate with their increased responsibilities. Upon completion of the above, members must meet career performance and physical fitness standards, participate in a field training exercise or actual operations, pass a written knowledge test, complete a preparatory oral knowledge board, and lastly pass a final comprehensive oral examination board. The insignia is issued in two degrees: silver for enlisted personnel and gold for officers. The insignia features an armed Seabee, superimposed over a crossed sword and rifle (a Springfield M1903) atop oak leaves. On the officer's insignia the rifle is crossed with an officer's sabre. While the enlisted insignia is crossed with a cutlass. The bee is also the insignia for the Navy Seabees as a whole. The authorizing instruction, \\"Seabee Combat Warfare Specialist\\", OPNAVINST 1410.1, Department of the Navy, Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, Washington, DC 20350-2000, was released in March 1992. The design evolved over the coming months followed by approvals and production of the device. During the same period the initial applications for the insignia were prepared, reviewed and considered for approval. An enlisted member who receives the Seabee Combat Warfare Specialist insignia is authorized to place the designator (SCW) after his/her rating designator. For example, if Ralph Manzie is an SCW-qualified Construction Mechanic Chief Petty Officer, then his written name would be CMC (SCW) Ralph Manzie. The first person to wear this insignia was its designer Commander Ross S. Selvidge, CEC, USNR, at the Navy Reserve Center, Los Alamitos, CA, in March 1993.

The Milwaukee Hurling Club (MHC), founded by Tom Mills, first introduced the sport of hurling to Milwaukee in 1996 with 30 members. In 1997, four teams were formed and this enabled the club to hold regular games. From 1998 through 2001 the league featured 6 teams. The number of people playing continued growing, and by 2002 the membership grew to 160 members playing on 8 teams, as well as 30-plus members participating in Camogie. In 2010 the MHC grew to over 300 members, including over 100 youth. The Milwaukee Hurling Club's 15th season featured 10 adult co-ed teams, and 6 youth teams.  The Milwaukee Hurling Club and the North American Gaelic Athletic Association  The Milwaukee Hurling Club attempts to develop American players unlike some of the clubs in Chicago and Atlanta which bring in players from Ireland . The club is funded by the players and sponsors. While the MHC plays games among the 11 teams within the club there are travelling teams which compete in North American Gaelic Athletic Association (NAGAA) tournaments. Specifically, there have been two men's and a women's (Camogie) travelling teams. The traveling teams are made up of players who also play on the coed club teams. In 2007, the Milwaukee Men's Junior B travelling team captured its first NAGAA Championship. In 2008, The Milwaukee Men's Junior B travelling team repeated as NAGAA Champions and will move up to Junior A in 2009. Due to the success of promoting the sport of hurling the club administrator, Dave Olson, was honored by the GAA in Ireland with the President's Award. This was the first time ever that an American had been recognized with such an honor. As the MHC has grown and become more organized it has been more involved with the NAGAA but has still maintained an independent status. The separation specifically allows for coed teams which is not allowed on official NAGAA teams.

African American composers were rare in the U.S. during this period, but Johnson was among the few who were successful. Performing as a virtuoso of the (now rare) keyed Kent bugle and the violin, he wrote more than two hundred compositions of various styles‚Äîoperatic airs, Ethiopian minstrel songs, patriotic marches, ballads, cotillions, quadrilles, quicksteps and other dances. Only manuscripts and piano transcriptions survive today. Johnson was the first African American composer to have his works published as sheet music. He also was the first African American to give public concerts and the first to participate in racially integrated concerts in the United States. He led the first American musical ensemble to present concerts abroad, and he introduced the promenade concert style to America. Biography Francis \\"Frank\\" Johnson was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on June 16, 1792 and baptized three months later at St. Paul's Episcopal Church on September 23rd.Jones, Charles K. (2006) Francis Johnson: Chronicle of a Black Musician in Early Nineteenth-Century Philadelphia. Bethlehem: Lehigh University Press. pp. 32-34. He directed military bands and society dance orchestras, taught music, and performed on the violin and keyed bugle. His early career consisted of performing for balls, parades, and dancing schools. He first became widely known in 1818 when George Willig published Johnson's Collection of New Cotillions. His career flourished in the 1820s, as he performed arrangements of \\"fashionable\\" music for most of the major dance functions in Philadelphia. In 1837 Johnson and a small ensemble of African American musicians sailed to England to take part in the celebrations surrounding the ascent of Queen Victoria to the British throne. While there, he was exposed to the promenade concert style. When Johnson returned from England in 1838 he introduced this new style of concert in Philadelphia during the Christmas season. Frank Johnson piano manuscript, 1820. The Library Company of Philadelphia. Johnson's Voice Quadrilles, a musical work performed in London and in major U.S. cities, was well received and successful. His work New Cotillions and March was performed for General LaFayette, as America celebrated LaFayette's visit in 1824. A townsman in Philadelphia noted that nothing would be more natural than for a master such as Johnson to perform at the grand LaFayette Ball. This notoriety is a hint as to why Johnson's music was included in compilations alongside Beethoven, Bellini, Brahms, Burgm√ºller, Czerny, Donizetti and Weber. When his Philadelphia brass band toured England in 1838, Johnson was able to play for Queen Victoria. After playing for Queen Victoria, she presented him with a silver bugle. Johnson successfully rivaled white musical organizations, receiving patronage from the public in spite of the considerable racial discrimination of the time. Available accounts show that his composition and playing must have had qualities which cannot be reconstructed from the surviving manuscripts. Historical accounts suggest that his performances infused stylistic rhythmic changes, differing from the written versions, which were either inferred by performers or instructed verbally. This is presumed to be similar to the improvisations made by jazz musicians today, although the current practices and idioms are probably vastly different from the ones used by Johnson. He was able to create interesting music, harmonies, and effects that differed from the diatonic harmonies and triadic melodies that were popular at that time.Southern 112‚Äì113 Francis Johnson Historical Marker, Philadelphia PA Johnson also performed sacred music at black churches in Philadelphia, New York, and Boston. He staged a performance of Creation in March 1841 at the First African Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia, and later repeated the performance at a European-American church. Johnson served as a teacher to wealthy European-American students, one of whom wrote that the teacher's studio walls were covered with images of instruments, various instruments could be found around the room, and shelves were laden with thousands of musical collections. The student noted that Johnson's spot for composing contained unfinished manuscripts, with pen and ink ready for use. After Johnson's death, the Frank Johnson Orchestra continued to play under that name led by Joseph Anderson Sr. with music arrangements by Henry F. Williams.Schwartz, Richard I. The Cornet Compendium: The History and Development of the Nineteenth-Century Cornet. 2001. p120 Music=Musical innovations The Philadelphia Public Ledger newspaper reported that Johnson introduced the extended technique of singing while playing, which has become more common today as a way of providing wind instrumentalists a means of producing harmonies. The use of flute obbligato to imitate the chirping of canaries in his \\"Bird Waltz\\" was \\"so natural that the keenest perception cannot discover the difference.\\" Composers Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel may have been influenced by Johnson's techniques. The orchestral version of Ravel's \\"Ma M√®re l'Oye\\" (Mother Goose) features a similar effect in the \\"Tom Thumb\\" movement, where flutes depict the chirping birds that steal the breadcrumb trail. The work Philadelphia Fireman's Quadrille astounded audiences as Johnson's bugle was heard to \\"distinctly cry, 'Fire!' 'Fire!'\\" Johnson became associated with such dramatic effects, and imitations by his contemporaries were said to be far less effective. Program music became popular during this period, particularly works that depicted battle. Johnson arranged Frantisek Kotzwara's The Battle of Prague, impressing the audience with realistic effects. Johnson's New Railroad Gallop began with the sound of steam, continued with the sound of passengers entering the cars, then concluded with the sound of the train reaching full speed. (Southern 112) Musical style Unfortunately, only reviews from newspaper critics, audience members and programs survive to tell of the sounds produced by Johnson. During this period, it was common to not write a complete score, since works were in such demand that this time-consuming task was best left as notes; the performers could more easily be taught to produce the desired sound. Arrangements were commonly published for amateurs in order to increase the demand for the original band or orchestra. Only surviving today are the piano arrangements requested by publishers, along with skeleton guides of Johnson's other arrangements. Johnson's elaborate and extended effects were apparently more important than his straightforward compositions. Foreshadowing the jazz era, his actual music was simple, allowing the composer to instruct the performers in developing more musically complex versions. References # Southern, Eileen.

He joined other Texan Democratic candidates such as Hank Gilbert, Fred Head, and Maria Luisa Alvarado in speaking out against the proposed Trans-Texas Corridor at public hearings in the summer of 2006. During his 2006 race for Attorney General of Texas, he vowed to fight for the people of Texas against the large monopolistic oil, insurance and media conglomerates, saying he'd \\"Fight them until hell freezes over and then fight them on the ice.\\" Much of his funding for his 2006 campaign came from contributions of $20 to $100 from low to medium income donors who met him during his 254 county whistlestop campaign tour or read about him on the blogs. His opponent, Republican incumbent Greg Abbott entered the race with over six million dollars in his campaign war chest. As the Democratic nominee for attorney general, Van Os took his campaign directly to the people. He pledged to visit all 254 counties in Texas during the 2006 election cycle. With his wife, Rachel Barrios-Van Os, who served as his campaign manager, he visited each courthouse and spoke on the courthouse square. His last five whistlestop were in Tarrant County on October 16, Dallas County on October 17, Harris County on October 18, Travis County on October 19 and his home county of Bexar on October 20. Local supporters joined him on the courthouse steps as he proclaimed his determination to \\"return Texas government back to the people\\" denouncing the \\"bought and paid for perversion of the American political process.\\" In Tarrant, truckdrivers passing on the street, acknowledged him by honking their horns when they saw the signs with his campaign message \\"Message to Big Oil -- I'm coming after you.\\" During much of 2006 gasoline prices had soared to a record of over three dollars a gallon and dipped rapidly a month before the general election by at least a dollar a gallon. Many people suspected that the timing of the rise and fall was due to political manipulation. Supporters of Van Os funded billboards in many counties in Texas with the following message: \\"Message to Big Oil - I'm coming after you!\\" His opponent, Abbott, received considerable money from insurance companies. Van Os vowed to use the office of the attorney general, if elected, to enforce the anti-trust provisions of the Texas and U.S. constitutions, especially regarding insurance company pricing. His other billboard message during the 2006 attorney general's race was: \\"Insurance Gougers - I'm coming after you!\\" Election history=Most recent election2006Previous elections2004=1998Personal life He married Rachel Barrios-Van Os, a native of San Antonio. They have one son, B.J. and three daughters, Kay Cee, Maya and Leya.

Sheridan, then playing in clubs in Hamburg with the Beatles, was discovered by producer Bert Kaempfert and subsequently signed with him to record for Polydor. Sheridan recorded several songs with the Beatles, of which, only a single was released in 1961 and credited to Tony Sheridan and the Beat Brothers. While these two songs are included here, the remaining tracks contained in this album were credited again to the Beat Brothers but recorded without the Beatles. Because of the later fame of the Beatles, the eight songs recorded in Hamburg with the then fledgling group have been issued in 1964 and repackaged several times through the years. Background and recording In June 1961, Sheridan and the Beatles (then consisting of guitarists John Lennon, George Harrison, and Paul McCartney, bassist Stuart Sutcliffe, and drummer Pete Best) were both playing in Hamburg's Top Ten Club, the two frequently performing together. German producer Bert Kaempfert visited the Top Ten on the recommendation of music publisher Alfred Schacht and singer Tommy Kent, and subsequently signed Sheridan and the Beatles to his company Bert Kaempfert Productions. Kaempfert set a recording date for 22 June at Hamburg's Friedrich-Ebert-Halle. Engineered by Karl Hinze, the session featured Sheridan and the Beatles playing \\"My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean\\", \\"The Saints\\", \\"Why\\", \\"Nobody's Child\\", and \\"Take Out Some Insurance\\". The Beatles performed \\"Ain't She Sweet\\" and an original song, \\"Beatle Bop\\" (later titled \\"Cry for a Shadow\\"). Sutcliffe attended the session, but did not play, leaving McCartney to play bass. From these sessions, \\"My Bonnie\\" was released as a single (with \\"The Saints\\" as the B-side) through Polydor Records (who had an exclusive deal with Kaempfert's company) credited to \\"Tony Sheridan and the Beat Brothers\\", as the Beatles' contract enabled the record company to use a pseudonym. A single with \\"My Bonnie\\" backed by \\"The Saints\\" was released in Germany in October 1961 and was a moderate success, peaking at number 32 in the national chart published in Der Musikmarkt, number 11 in the national jukebox charts, and number four in a local Hamburg chart. Kaempfert and Sheridan conducted another session on 21 December 1961 at Musikhalle Hamburg, without the Beatles. Ten songs were recorded at this session, which along with \\"My Bonnie\\" and \\"The Saints\\" formed the My Bonnie LP, released 5 January 1962. Track listing ;Side one #\\"My Bonnie\\" (Traditional, arr. by Tony Sheridan) #\\"Skinny Minnie\\" (Bill Haley, Rusty Keefer, Milt Gabler, Catherine Cafra) #\\"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin On\\" (Dave Williams, Sonny David) #\\"I Know Baby\\" (Sheridan) #\\"You Are My Sunshine\\" (Jimmie Davis, Charles Mitchell) #\\"Ready Teddy\\" (Robert Blackwell, John Marascalco) ;Side two # * \\"The Saints\\" (James Milton Black, Katharine Purvis) #\\"Hallelujah, I Love Her So\\" (Ray Charles) #\\"Let's Twist Again\\" (Kal Mann, Dave Appell, Buchenkamp) #\\"Sweet Georgia Brown\\" (Bernie, Pinkard, Casey) #\\"Swanee River\\" (Stephen Foster) #\\"Top Ten Twist\\" (Homsen, Bones, Sheridan, L√ºth) In 2001, The My Bonnie LP was issued on CD by Polydor, with 10 bonus tracks: # * \\"My Bonnie (German intro)\\" (Traditional, arr. by Sheridan) #\\"Ich Lieb' Dich So\\" (Pomus, Spector, Lueth) #\\"Der Kiss-Me Song\\" (Warren, Schwabach, Wallnau) #\\"Madison Kid\\" (C.

The German import became popular in Liverpool, and Epstein secured a British release on 5 January 1962, credited to Tony Sheridan and the Beatles After the Beatles gained fame several songs from their sessions together were released. \\"Sweet Georgia Brown\\", backed with \\"Take Out Some Insurance\\", was released as a single in 1964. Although \\"Take Out Some Insurance\\" was from the June 1961 sessions, the A-side was not. Backing tracks to \\"Sweet Georgia Brown\\" and \\"Swanee River\\" were recorded by the Beatles 24 May 1962. This session was arranged by Brian Epstein and Bert Kaempfert to free the Beatles from their contract with Kaempfert and Polydor. Sheridan's vocals to \\"Sweet Georgia Brown\\", referencing the Beatles' fame, were added later. These versions of \\"Sweet Georgia Brown\\" and \\"Swanee River\\" are not the recordings featured on My Bonnie. The version of \\"Swanee River\\" featuring the Beatles is considered lost. \\"Ain't She Sweet\\" / \\"Nobody's Child\\" and \\"Why\\" / \\"Cry for a Shadow\\" were also released as singles. Other releases Polydor issued two EPs from the album sessions. The first, Ya Ya (October 1962, Polydor 21 485), contained \\"Ya Ya\\" / \\"Sweet Georgia Brown\\" / \\"Skinnie Minnie\\". The second, My Bonnie (July 1963, Polydor 21 610) contained \\"My Bonnie\\" / \\"Cry for a Shadow\\" / \\"The Saints\\" / \\"Why\\". This EP was previously released in France in January 1962 as \\"\\". To capitalise on the Beatles' fame, their recordings with Sheridan have been rereleased multiple times by different record companies: * The Beatles with Tony Sheridan and Their Guests (1964) * Ain't She Sweet (1964) * The Beatles' First (1964) * Very Together (1969) * In the Beginning (Circa 1960) (1970) * The Early Tapes of the Beatles (1984) * Beatles Bop ‚Äì Hamburg Days (2001) * First Beat (2004) * I Saw Her Standing There (2013) References=Bibliography * 1962 debut albums 1962 debut EPs 1963 EPs Albums produced by Bert Kaempfert British rock-and-roll albums Polydor Records albums Polydor Records EPs Polydor Records singles Songs based on children's songs The Beatles EPs The Beatles with Tony Sheridan albums The Beatles with Tony Sheridan songs ","title":"My Bonnie"},{"id":"1357858","text":"Blanche Elizabeth Devereaux (n√©e Hollingsworth) is a character from the sitcom television series The Golden Girls, and its spin-off The Golden Palace. Blanche was portrayed by Rue McClanahan for 8 years and 204 episodes across the two series. The character was inspired by Blanche DuBois (to whom Blanche Devereaux is compared in the pilot script) and Scarlett O'Hara. McClanahan had previously been a co-star with Beatrice Arthur in Maude and with Betty White in the first two seasons of Mama's Family. In pre-production, producers had originally planned for White (who was known for playing promiscuous characters such as Sue Ann Nivens) to play Blanche, but neither White nor McClanahan wanted to be typecast, and the two were given permission to switch roles. Family Blanche Hollingsworth grew up near Atlanta, Georgia, at her family's mansion, Twin Oaks. Her parents were the late Elizabeth-Ann Margaret Bennett (later seasons named her \\"Samantha Roquet\\") (Helen Kleeb) and Curtis \\"Big Daddy\\" Hollingsworth (first Murray Hamilton, and after Hamilton died, David Wayne), the latter a revered man in his neck of the woods. As a young child, she had a mammy named Viola Watkins, Ruby Dee who took care of her before suddenly leaving one day. Much to Blanche's dismay, her father married a young widow named Margaret Spencer (Sondra Currie) years after Blanche's mother died, but she grudgingly accepted the marriage. After her father's death, she learned that he and Watkins had been secret lovers for over 40 years. Blanche is a member of \\"the Alpha Gams\\" (Alpha Gamma Delta), but which university she attended is not known. On a few occasions, Blanche states that she is of the Baptist faith. She is proud of her status as a Southern debutante, but when tracing her family history, is shocked to learn that she has a Jewish great-grandmother named Rosalyn Feldman from Buffalo, New York, which prevents her from joining the Daughters of the Old South, a Southern women's organization (based on the United Daughters of the Confederacy). Blanche is the third of five Hollingsworth children. Charmaine Hollingsworth (Barbara Babcock) is the spoiled oldest sister, who infuriated Blanche when she wrote a sordid novel that Blanche thought was about her. When it was revealed that the book was about Charmaine and not Blanche, they made up and apologized to each other. The next youngest sibling is Blanche's brother Clayton Hollingsworth (Monte Markham), who appears in season four (1988) and season six (1991). Blanche is troubled to some extent when she learns that Clayton is gay; her reluctance to accept Clayton's sexual orientation nearly cost her relationship with him. Blanche's sister Virginia Hollingsworth (Sheree North), with whom Blanche shares a mutual loathing, is one year her junior. They buried the hatchet when Virginia went into kidney failure and Blanche offered her kidney to her sister. However, their relationship became strained once more after their argument following Big Daddy's death in which Virginia accused Blanche of being too selfish and self-centered to say goodbye to her own father. During The Golden Palace, Blanche was revealed to have a mentally challenged older brother, Tad Hollingsworth (Ned Beatty), who has spent most of his life in a Chattanooga institution. Blanche also has a promiscuous niece named Lucy (Hallie Todd), who visits her during the first season. Love life Although notoriously man-hungry, Blanche was faithfully married for decades to her husband, George Devereaux. George died in either 1981 or 1982, four years before the start of the series in 1985, and at some point earlier they had moved from Atlanta to Miami. In a 1990 episode, Blanche had a dream that George came back from the dead nine years later (he said that he faked his death to escape criminal prosecution for fraud, for which he was framed by his own business partner). Rue McClanahan has said that George was the love of Blanche's life, and that her promiscuity was in fact a desperate search for the next love of her life. The cause of George's death is never definitively established in the series; he either died immediately during a car accident when Blanche was at home, or after being in a coma when Blanche was getting a pedicure. During her senior year in high school, Christmas 1949, when she was 17, she almost eloped with Deck Boughvenlough, the father of her rival at cheerleading with the sole purpose of having her taken off the squad. From this story, Blanche was shown to be born in 1932. On the show, Blanche is shown to have dated various men, some of them unsavory. She almost married a bigamist in the pilot episode before he got caught by the police. Another man stole her necklace at her full moon-leap year's party, and he, too, was caught by the police. One boyfriend named Rex was emotionally and verbally abusive, until her roommate Dorothy helped her realize his true personality. Another boyfriend Gary (Jerry Hardin) cheated on her by sleeping with Rose's sister Holly (Inga Swenson), who was visiting. Yet another, who appears in The Golden Palace, turns out to be a gigolo (Barry Bostwick). Blanche overcame her apprehension of dating Ted, who was in a wheelchair, only to find out he was married, so she terminated the relationship because she has never been the \\"other woman\\" in extramarital affairs and never wanted to be. The only other time that occurred was when her beau's wife was revived by paramedics after she was declared dead. Blanche has also ruined good relationships with worthy men. Jake (Donnelly Rhodes) was perfect and wanted to marry her, he was charming and romantic, but they had too many differences and she turned him down, to the disgust of her roommates, and regretted it later. When Steven (Robert Mandan) was hospitalized, she refused to visit him until much later, by which time he reconciled with his ex-girlfriend, Karen. Unlike Blanche, who feared commitment and having another man die on her, when Karen heard of Steven's illness, she went right to his side when he needed someone. She also dated John Quinn (Edward Winter) and considered breaking up with him because he was blind and she felt self-conscious because she knew he was not attracted to her physical beauty. She later apologized to him and made plans to go out with him again, but the relationship apparently ended, as he is never mentioned on the series again. Blanche's most frequent (but only seen once in season six) date was Mel Bushman (Alan King), who was always available whenever she lacked male companionship. The one time he was not, Blanche assumed he was dead and promptly fell in temporary love with him when she realized he was alive. Because of his zipper manufacturing business, Mel was known as \\"The Zipper King\\". When Blanche's death is reported mistakenly in a newspaper, Mel Bushman sends flowers and a note, saying he has gone back to his ex-wife. Blanche is portrayed as a promiscuous woman. In one episode, it is stated that her initials, Blanche Elizabeth Devereaux, spell out the word \\"BED.\\" However, in a previous episode, Viola Watkins calls her \\"Blanche Marie Hollingsworth\\". Blanche spends a great deal of her time with men, and this is a source of both condemnation from and amusement to her roommates. Blanche's seemingly liberated human sexual behavior is a contrast to the sexual climate of the 1980s, when AIDS was beginning to seep into a nation's consciousness. However, in the episode \\"72 Hours\\", Blanche was cognizant of the dangers of HIV and STDs; she always used protection and knows every lover's full sexual history. It is also implied in one episode that she has had numerous interracial sexual liaisons with African-American men, though no such relations were ever depicted on camera. In spite of her promiscuity, Blanche was actually conservative in many respects. She was a Republican, plus she had a hard time accepting her brother Clayton's homosexuality, and still seemed to have issues in regards to his sexual orientation when he visited her again with his partner Doug (Michael Ayr). Age Throughout the course of the show, Blanche's precise age was never told. During the Mother's Day episode, Blanche's mother says that she was 17 in 1949, placing her birth year in 1931 or 1932. In an episode later in the series, Rose successfully got all of Blanche's documentation, but when she sat down with the other girls to go over the information she had received, the age columns of all of papers said \\"Deleted by Authority of the Governor\\", implying Blanche had sex with the Governor to get her age struck from her record. In a 1993 episode of The Golden Palace, Blanche's mentally unstable brother, Tad, confirms to Rose that Blanche is in her early 60s. In Season 2, Episode 1 1986 \\"End of the Curse\\", Blanche fears she is pregnant. She told the Girls that she will be 65 when the baby is 18. Therefore she will be 47 in Season 2. In real life, Rue McClanahan was the youngest member of the show's cast (10 years younger than the other three series regulars), and the same is true of her character. Children and grandchildren At various times over the course of the series, Blanche mentions the names of six children: Janet, Rebecca, Mathew, Doug, \\"Biff\\", and \\"Skippy\\". However, in the third-season episode \\"Bringing Up Baby\\", when Dorothy questions an impulsive car purchase, Blanche says to her: \\"I have had four children, I have never had a Mercedes\\". She mentions three sons ‚Äî Skippy, Biff and Doug ‚Äî in the episode \\"Bringing Up Baby\\", while the fourth name, Matthew, was mentioned in the episode \\"To Catch a Neighbor\\" and made an on- screen appearance on an episode of The Golden Palace, played by Texan comic Bill Engvall). During the series, Blanche learns that George also had a son named David (Mark Moses), as the result of an affair. During the course of the show, Blanche is revealed not to have been very \\"hands-on\\" as a mother, as she frequently left her children to nannies and housekeepers. She had a strained relationship with both of her daughters, especially Janet, something that led to some of the most dramatic storylines as she expressed regrets that she was not there for her children more, and it is loosely implied that she might have even been emotionally abusive to them when they were growing up (however the relationship between her sons is never mentioned). However, Blanche slowly rebuilt her relationships with Janet and Rebecca throughout the series. By the time the series ended, both Rebecca and Janet had healed their relationships with their mother. Blanche's daughter, Rebecca, was seen most often on the show, although Blanche and she had frequent falling outs and bitter fights. When Rebecca was first introduced, she was overweight and about to marry a verbally abusive man (Joe Regalbuto). Later in the series, they fought over a slimmed-down Rebecca's decision to be artificially inseminated and raising the baby without a father. Rebecca decided to visit a birthing center saying: \\"Hospitals have a rigid way of doing things.\\" After hearing a frightening shriek, Rebecca changes her mind and lets her mother take her to a hospital and even lets her help with the labor in the delivery room. Rebecca gave birth to her daughter, Aurora. They feuded again when Rebecca believed that Blanche was using her granddaughter to \\"get a man.\\" In each case, they eventually made up again, which was something Blanche seems not to have entirely done with Janet. Besides Aurora, Blanche has at least three other grandchildren: David, Melissa, and Sarah, all born to Janet, who married a \\"Yankee.\\" Blanche's 14-year-old grandson David visited the girls in the first season, but was unhappy and rebellious, due to problems in his home life. Sophia eventually hit him for being disrespectful. After David confided in Blanche, she told Janet that she wanted David to live with her, leading to a bitter falling out between mother and daughter. Relationship with her roommates Blanche acts as co-roommate and landlord to Rose Nylund, Dorothy Zbornak, and Sophia Petrillo. Throughout the series, Rose and she are often involved in the same activities. Though she, like Dorothy and Sophia, is annoyed at times by Rose's constant storytelling, she saw her as both her best friend and a surrogate sister. Blanche has her own collection of strange stories which she shares from time to time, often tales of her rivalry with sisters Virginia and Charmaine or of the promiscuous stunts she pulled as a teenager. Her relationship with Dorothy is mixed with envy and condemnation and sisterhood on both parts: Dorothy envies and condemns Blanche's sexual comfortability, while Blanche envies Dorothy's intelligence and condemns her fashion sense, among other things. And yet, both Dorothy and she at times isolate themselves from Rose, ganging up on her when the latter said anything particularly foolish, and taking turns hitting her on the head with a newspaper or magazine. Their relationship is also symbiotic; in one of the last episodes in the series, Dorothy admitted that Blanche has helped her be comfortable with her own sexuality, while Dorothy herself has always served as Blanche's other voice of reason. Although Blanche is only a few years younger than Dorothy and Rose, she frequently brags about being the youngest roommate in the house. Blanche considers Sophia as both a mother figure and as a mean old lady. Sophia considers Blanche as one of her own daughters, and very vocally, as a street prostitute. In the pilot episode, Sophia bluntly tells Blanche, \\"You look like a prostitute.\\" Significance Rue McClanahan said playing the role of Blanche made her \\"one of the most recognizable women in the world,\\" and resulted in her being named the \\"Fifth most beloved celebrity over 55\\" in the world. She said the fame of Blanche Devereaux, on television \\"week after week for decades\\", made McClanahan inseparable from Blanche in the public eye. Blanche and the other three women were hailed as breakthrough television role models for older women, being attractive, stylishly dressed, and romantically active. Additional appearances Outside The Golden Girls and The Golden Palace, Blanche appears in the Empty Nest episode \\"Fatal Attraction\\" and the Nurses episode \\"Moon Over Miami\\".

The free paraphrase Choosing a Bible Translation by Michael Zwaagstra, http://www.adventist.org/spirituality/bible-study/article/go/0/choosing-a- bible-translation/ was initially printed at the school by the Southern College Press of Southern Adventist University and sold in Church-owned Adventist Book Centers. Though The Clear Word is not officially endorsed by the Seventh-day Adventist Church, it is now being printed by the Review and Herald Publishing Association. History and reception Blanco originally wrote The Clear Word as a devotional exercise for himself. After friends and family saw what he did, they encouraged him to publish it. The New Testament part was first published and readers widely received and encouraged him to continue paraphrasing the whole Bible. It is considered a free paraphrase of the Bible: In the preface Blanco explains precisely what he did in producing the paraphrase. A former President of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, Pastor Robert S. Folkenberg read it and endorsed it. It was also advertised on more than one occasion in the Adventist Review.Folkenberg endorsement and Adventist Review advertisement, reproduced by SDAnet.org Blanco himself states in the preface of the book, \\"Those who are better qualified have given readers of the Holy Scriptures excellent translations for such purposes and undoubtedly will continue to do so as additional manuscripts come to light.\\" Controversy and criticism In response to criticism, the South Pacific Division of the church released the following statement: David Newman, editor of Ministry magazine wrote a letter expressing concerns about The Clear Word (June 28, 1994), stating that \\"A cursory examination of the Clear Word Bible reveals the prolific addition of many ideas not found in Scripture.\\" Others within the church, such as Phil Ward, have expressed criticism in two areas. One that the current publisher does not have a large enough footprint to get The Clear Word out to mainstream Christian book centers, and that the paraphrase has too much extra material in it.

Light-colored lines indicate two previous states. MLT-3 encoding (Multi-Level Transmit) is a line code (a signaling method used in a telecommunication system for transmission purposes) that uses three voltage levels. An MLT-3 interface emits less electromagnetic interference and requires less bandwidth than most other binary or ternary interfaces that operate at the same bit rate (see PCM for discussion on bandwidth / quantization tradeoffs), such as Manchester code or Alternate Mark Inversion. MLT-3 cycles sequentially through the voltage levels ‚àí1, 0, +1, 0. It moves to the next state to transmit a 1 bit, and stays in the same state to transmit a 0 bit. Similar to simple NRZ encoding, MLT-3 has a coding efficiency of 1 bit/baud, however it requires four transitions (baud) to complete a full cycle (from low-to-middle, middle-to-high, high-to-middle, middle-to-low). Thus, the maximum fundamental frequency is reduced to one fourth of the baud rate. This makes signal transmission more amenable to copper wires. The lack of transition on a 0 bit means that for practical use, the number of consecutive 0 bits in the transmitted data must be bounded; i.e. it must be pre-coded using a run-length limited code. This results in an effective bitrate slightly lower than one bit per baud or four bits per cycle. MLT-3 was first introduced by Crescendo Communications, Network World, June 29, 1992, page 19 as a coding scheme for FDDI copper interconnect (TP-PMD,  initial implementation; also see patent aka CDDI). Later, the same technology was used in the 100BASE-TX physical medium dependent sublayer, given the considerable similarities between FDDI and 100BASE-[TF]X physical media attachment layer (section 25.3 of IEEE802.3-2002 specifies that ANSI X3.263:1995 TP-PMD should be consulted, with minor exceptions). Signaling specified by 100BASE-T4 Ethernet, while it has three levels, is not compatible with MLT-3. It uses selective base-2 to base-3 conversion with direct mapping of base-3 digits to line levels (8B6T code).

The film had its World Premiere at the Warner Theatre in London's West End on 10 January 1963.The Times,10 January 1963, page 2  Plot  The story concerns Don (Cliff Richard) and his friends Cyril, Steve and Edwin (played by Melvyn Hayes, Teddy Green and Jeremy Bulloch) who are bus mechanics at the huge London Transport bus overhaul works in Aldenham, Hertfordshire. During a miserably wet British summer lunch break, Don arrives, having persuaded London Transport to lend him and his friends an AEC Regent III RT double-decker bus (not a later AEC Routemaster, as is often stated). They convert the bus into a holiday caravan, which they drive across continental Europe, intending to reach the South of France. However, their eventual destination is Athens, Greece.

They were all converted to look like RT1881 (with a fake registration number, WLB991) so they could be used for filming different segments. The opening ten minutes was filmed at the Aldenham Works, Elstree, where Cliff's character and friends are mechanics at the main bus servicing depot for London Transport. While on lunch one rainy day, they come up with the idea of converting an old RT bus into a mobile home. They enlist the help of their workmates in a musical segment that uses the track Seven Days to a Holiday. The scenes were shot at the works in 1962, during its annual summer shutdown. Filming included large parts of the works as well as numerous actual employees as extras. The rest of the film was shot in Greece. Soundtrack There are 16 song and musical numbers in the film: \\"Seven Days to a Holiday\\", \\"Let Us Take You for a Ride\\", \\"Stranger in Town\\", \\"Swinging Affair\\", \\"Really Waltzing\\", \\"Yugoslavian Wedding\\", \\"All At Once\\", \\"Summer Holiday\\", \\"Bachelor Boy\\", \\"Dancing Shoes\\", \\"Foot Tapper\\", \\"Big News\\", \\"The Next Time\\", \\"Les Girls\\", \\"Round and Round\\", and \\"Orlando's Mime\\". The film's producers felt that female lead in the film, Lauri Peters, was not a strong enough singer after several test recording sessions, and all of her parts, both in the film and on the soundtrack album, were dubbed by session vocalist Grazina Frame. Frame had overdubbed female singing voices in Cliff Richard's earlier film The Young Ones.Grazina Frame at IMDB Cliff Richard, Melvyn Hayes, and the Shadows were recalled to Elstree some weeks after completion of shooting to record Bachelor Boy, as the distributors felt the film was too short.  Release =Box-office The film was the second most popular movie at the British box office in 1963, after the James Bond feature From Russia with Love. (and third was comedy film Tom Jones) It helped Cliff Richard to be voted by exhibitors as the most popular star at the British box-office in the same year.\\"Most Popular Films Of 1963.\\" Times [London, England] 3 January 1964: 4.

However it flopped in the US, where it was released two days after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Cultural impact The majority of the numbers integrated dance with song ‚Äì not merely serving as scenes to promote a number of \\"hit-parade\\" songs. Ross, an American choreographer later became a film director in his own right. Many singles from Cliff Richard lifted from the film, including the title track \\"Summer Holiday\\", as well as \\"The Next Time\\", \\"Bachelor Boy\\" and The Shadows instrumental \\"Foot Tapper\\" all reached Number one in the British charts during the first three months of 1963. The film suggested to the photographer Daniel Meadows a way in which he might emulate Benjamin Stone and travel around and photograph Britain from 1973 to 1974.Phil Coomes, \\"Daniel Meadows on digital literacy\\", BBC News in Pictures, 15 November 2011. It was voted the 99th greatest family film in a Channel 4 poll.  Stage adaptations  Summer Holiday was adapted into a stage musical in the mid-1990s, starring Darren Day in the role that Cliff Richard played. It premiered for a summer season at The Opera House in Blackpool in 1996, and then later toured nationally, before returning to Blackpool in 1998. The cast for these included Claire Buckfield, Isla Fisher, Faith Brown, Ross King, Peter Baldwin, and Ren√© Zagger. It was also recorded and released on video, entitled \\"Summer Holiday - The Hits\\", which was all the musical numbers strung together by clips of Darren Day writing postcards to his friends, and describing what was happening in the story as he wrote. The stage musical differs in a number of respects from the film version. For example, the route to Athens is via Italy in the stage version rather than the original film route via Yugoslavia. The songs also differ, and include a number of songs from Cliff Richard's other early back catalogue, such as \\"The Young Ones\\". The stage musical was revived in 2003, starring Stefan Booth, but later starred Darren Day again. This production also included Day's future partner Suzanne Shaw (from the pop group Hear'say) as Bobby, and Aimi MacDonald as Bobby's mother. The production toured the UK.

The shopping center is anchored by Halls, a department store which is owned and operated by Hallmark Cards. The neighborhood contains numerous residences, retail establishments, entertainment venues, and restaurants including the American Restaurant, the only Forbes Travel Guide four-star restaurant in Missouri. It is home to Hallmark Cards, and the headquarters of Shook, Hardy & Bacon and Lathrop & Gage, two of Kansas City's largest law firms. History Before the First World War, Downtown Kansas City was heavily populated and bustling. The area today home to Crown Center was an extension of the Union Hill historic neighborhood. Gradually, however, the center of population for the metro area moved south, and by the Second World War the area today comprising Crown Center had become dilapidated. Although Hallmark had maintained its headquarters at 26th Street and Grand Boulevard since 1922, the headquarters itself and nearby Union Station comprised the only non-slum in the area. Instead there were old warehouses, used car lots, and vacant buildings. In 1966, Donald J. Hall, Sr. became President and CEO of Hallmark Cards, taking over from his father, Joyce Hall. Joyce Hall had long wished to develop the area around the corporate headquarters, and with his new leadership Donald Hall quickly made it known that he wished to renew the area entirely. Hallmark quietly began acquiring all the property surrounding its headquarters, and consulted with urban planning experts about the possibility of creating an experimental \\"city within a city\\" on the property. The City of Kansas City formally approved the plans for Crown Center (named after the Hallmark corporate symbol) by the end of 1967. The master design was prepared by Edward Larrabee Barnes. Ground was broken for the complex in September 1968. Construction of the hotel, designed by Harry Weese in the Brutalist style, began in 1971. It opened in May 1973 as the Crown Center Hotel, managed by Western International Hotels.https://dnr.mo.gov/shpo/docs/moachp/Crown%20Center%20Hotel.pdf Signboard Hill is included in the hotel's design as a waterfall. Norman Fletcher designed the first residences. Henry Cobb of the I.M. Pei firm designed 2600 Grand office and Dan Kiley laid out the park in the south area of the complex. Warren Plattner, designer of Windows on the World, designed the interior space at the American Restaurant when it was operated by Joseph Baum (who also operated The Four Seasons and the Rainbow Room). In 2016, the restaurant announced plans to close and to become primarily a special event venue. The original concept for the shops was an international bazaar, part of which was a maze-like area known as West Village. Designed by architects Fran√ßois Dallegret and Joseph Baker, West Village proved unsuccessful and was replaced by a more conventional layout. Western International Hotels was rebranded as Westin Hotels in 1981, and the hotel was renamed The Westin Crown Center soon after. In addition to the Westin, the Crown Center complex is home to the Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center, opened July 1, 1980 as the Hyatt Regency Kansas City. The roof had collapsed during construction, and then the hotel suffered the walkway collapse on July 17, 1981, killing 114 people in the deadliest non‚Äëdeliberate structural failure in American history. Location specifics Today, the shopping and entertainment complex features three levels of shops and restaurants, a set of grand open air fountains, live theaters, an ice skating rink and over-street walkways leading throughout the complex and to Kansas City's Union Station. One of the most notable stores is the Halls department store designed by Paul L√°szl√≥. The complex also includes the 45-story Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center (which was Missouri's tallest building when built), a Westin hotel, and two upscale residential apartment skyscrapers. Kansas City's three largest law firms maintain their headquarters in other skyscrapers in the neighborhood. The neighborhood's grounds are replete with parks, fountains, green spaces and unique sculptures. The global headquarters campus for Hallmark Cards is located on the eastern side of Crown Center. Mayor's Christmas Tree A century-old tradition, the Mayor's Christmas tree at Hallmark Cards‚Äô Crown Center is strung with more than 7,200 white lights during the winter holidays and stands 100 feet tall, which is taller than the famous National Christmas Tree and Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree, as well as the White House Christmas Tree. A special guest or celebrity \\"flips the switch\\" each year. For example, in 2010 Chef Celina Tio (owner and chef of Julian in K.C., Missouri) on Food Network's The Next Iron Chef, joined Kansas City's Mayor Mark Funkhouser to light the tree. The lighting ceremony is held the day after Thanksgiving and the annual Country Club Plaza Lighting Ceremony. After the holidays, the tree is cut into commemorative ornaments and sold to benefit the Mayor's Christmas Tree Fund, which assists city residents in poverty.

It is the only species in the genus Oena. It is found over much of Sub-Saharan Africa as well as Arabia and Madagascar. Taxonomy In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the Namaqua dove in his six volume Ornithologie based on a specimen collected near the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa. He used the French name La tourterelle du Cap de Bonne Esp√©rance and the Latin Turtur capitis bonae spei. The two stars (**) at the start of the section indicates that Brisson based his description on the examination of a specimen. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the Namaqua dove which he placed with the other pigeons in the genus Columba. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Columba capensis and cited Brisson's work. The specific name capensis denotes the Cape of Good Hope. The Namaqua dove is placed in its own genus Oena that was introduced by the English naturalist William John Swainson in 1837. The genus name is from the Ancient Greek oinas meaning \\"pigeon\\". Two subspecies are recognised: * O. c. capensis (Linnaeus, 1766) ‚Äì Africa south of the Sahara, island of Socotra, Arabia * O. c. aliena Bangs, 1918 ‚Äì Madagascar Description The Namaqua dove is a tiny sparrow-sized pigeon, typically 22 cm in length with a 28‚Äì33 cm wingspan, and weighing 40g. It has a very long black tapered tail, and the size and shape have led to comparison with the budgerigar. The plumage is mostly grey apart from a white belly, and chestnut primary feathers which are visible in flight. The adult male has a yellow and red beak and a black face, throat and breast. The adult female lacks the black and has a red-based grey bill. Young birds are dark blotched on the wings and shoulders, and otherwise resemble the females. The song is a quiet, short, double hoo, higher on the longer second note kuh-whooo, mournful and frequently repeated. Distribution and habitat The dove is a widespread resident breeding bird in Sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar with its range extending into the Arabian Peninsula southern Israel, Jordan and as far north as Turkey. It is found in near desert with acacia and bushes. The namaqua dove is prone to wander out its original range, it is now being recorded south Asian countries. In Pakistan this species is recorded near shore waters off Paradise Point, Karachi on Friday, 14 October 2016. In India a female namaqua dove is recorded at khijadiya bird sanctuary near jamnagar,Gujarat on 17 December 2017Trivedi A. and Trivedi K. 2018.Sighting of Namaqua Dove near Jamnagar, a first record for India. Flamingo 16(1):2-3 However, the bird is thought to be in trade in India, and a cage escapee can not be denied for its record from Western India. Behaviour The dove is quite terrestrial, and usually forages on open ground and roadsides. The food is almost exclusively minute seeds, such as those of grasses, sedges and weeds. It is not gregarious, being encountered singly or in pairs, though they may form larger flocks at waterholes. The flight is fast with clipped beats and a tendency to stay low. It builds a stick nest in a bush, and lays two white eggs, which are incubated for 16 days in typical pigeon fashion; the female at night and early morning and the male from mid morning till late afternoon.

It is sometimes called the Su-100.Sukhoi T-4 \\"Sotka\\" at the Russian Air Force Museum (Monino) Design and development In 1963, the Soviet government held a request for proposal among the aircraft design bureaus, with the aim of developing an aircraft analogous to the North American XB-70 Valkyrie. The Sukhoi design, with its high cruise speed of was favored over the designs submitted by Yakovlev and Tupolev and after a preliminary design review in June 1964, the building of a prototype was authorized. Development of the T-4 required massive research effort to develop the technologies necessary, including the manufacturing technologies to machine and weld the materials necessary to withstand sustained Mach 3 flight. Nearly 600 patents or inventions are attributed to the program.T-4 on Sukhoi Company website The first flying prototype was finally completed in the autumn of 1971. Work continued on an additional three airframes (one for static testing) through 1975. In 1974, the Ministry of Aviation Industry ordered work suspended on the T-4 project, which was officially scrapped on 19 December 1975. The T-4 had intake ramps similar to the XB-70, was made largely from titanium and stainless steel, and featured a quadruple-redundant fly-by-wire control system but also employed a mechanical system as a backup. The aircraft's droop nose lowered to provide visibility during takeoff and landing. A periscope was used for forward viewing when the nose was retracted, and could be employed at speeds of up to . Drogue parachutes were used in addition to conventional wheel brakes. Operational history The first T-4, designated \\"101\\", first flew on 22August 1972. The test pilot was Vladimir Ilyushin, son of famed aircraft designer, Sergei Ilyushin, and navigator Nikolai Alfyorov. Testing continued to 19January 1974. The T-4 flew only ten times for a total 10 hours and 20 minutes. It is believed to have reached at least Mach1.3 at an altitude of using four Kolesov RD36-41 engines. These engines each produced thrust with afterburners. The aircraft was designed to achieve speeds of up to Mach3.0 with nine tons of weapons (two MKB Raduga Kh-45 missiles) under the wings, but the program was cancelled before the full performance of the aircraft could be reached. .

Truman in Washington, DC. He had been living in New York City after growing up in Puerto Rico. Collazo was convicted and sentenced to death, but Truman commuted his sentence to life imprisonment. In 1979 Collazo's sentence was commuted to time served by President Jimmy Carter. He was paroled and allowed to return to Puerto Rico. Background Oscar Collazo L√≥pez was born in what is now Florida, Puerto Rico. In 1920, Collazo's father died and his mother sent him to live with his brother in Jayuya. His brother was a member of the Liberal Party which had independence beliefs. When Collazo was 14 years old, he participated in a student demonstration, which the government had made illegal, commemorating the birth of Jos√© de Diego, a known advocate for Puerto Rican independence who had died two years before. Career=Puerto Rico In 1932, when Collazo was 18 years old, he participated in another demonstration commemorating Jos√© de Diego. This time the main speaker was Pedro Albizu Campos, the president of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. That day Collazo was so impressed by Albizu Campos' leadership that he joined the Nationalist Party and devoted himself to it.\\"Rosa and Lydia Collazo\\", Peace Host Collazo heard Albizu talk about the abuses of American imperialism, as symbolized by Cornelius P. Rhoads, an American doctor who had written a controversial letter claiming to have killed Puerto Ricans in experiments. Outraged, Albizu had complained to the governor and gained an investigation. (Rhoads was eventually cleared of any crime.)Susan E.

There he met and married Rosa Cortez, a divorcee. The couple had a total of three daughters from previous marriages: Rosa with two and Collazo with one. He worked in a metal polishing factory and led a normal family life. He met and became friends with Albizu Campos when the latter was hospitalized for a time at the Columbus Hospital. Collazo had become the secretary and later served as president of the New York branch of the Nationalist Party. After he met Griselio Torresola in New York, the two men soon became friends.1950 Assassination attempt, Truman Library Truman assassination attempt On October 30, 1950, Torresola and Collazo learned that the Jayuya Uprising in Puerto Rico, led by the nationalist leader Blanca Canales, had failed. Torresola's sister had been wounded and his brother Elio was arrested. Believing they had to do something for their cause, Collazo and Torresola decided to assassinate President Harry S. Truman, in order to bring world attention to the need for independence in Puerto Rico. On October 31, 1950, Collazo and Torresola arrived at Union Station in Washington, D.C. and registered in the Harris Hotel. On November 1, 1950, with guns in hand, they attempted to enter the Blair House, where the President was living during renovation of the White House. During the attack, Torresola mortally wounded White House Police officer, Private Leslie Coffelt. Collazo wounded another man. After wounding two others, Torresola was killed by the mortally wounded Coffelt.

Collazo replied that he had nothing against Truman, saying that he was \\"a symbol of the system. You don't attack the man, you attack the system.\\"David McCullough, Truman, Simon & Schuster, 1992; p. 812. Collazo said he had been devoted to the Nationalist Party since 1932. Truman supported organizing a referendum in 1952 by which residents in Puerto Rico could vote on a proposed new constitution, which defined the island's status as an Estado Libre Associado, or Commonwealth. It was approved by 81.9% of voters.Nohlen, D (2005) Elections in the Americas: A Data Handbook, Volume I, pp. 552 and 556, In 1952, Collazo was convicted and sentenced to death. In 1952, his attorney Abraham Unger petitioned for the commutation of Oscar Collazo‚Äôs life sentence for his attempted assassination of U.S. President Harry S. Truman. President Truman commuted his sentence to life imprisonment. He was sent to the federal prison at Leavenworth, Kansas. Presidential commutation On September 6, 1979, President Jimmy Carter commuted his sentence to time served, after Collazo had spent 29 years in prison. President Carter also pardoned Collazo's fellow Nationalists: Irvin Flores, Rafael Cancel Miranda, and Lolita Lebr√≥n, convicted in the 1954 attack on Congress in which 5 members of the House of Representatives were wounded by gunfire. Collazo had been eligible for parole since April 1966, and Lebron since July 1969. Cancel, Miranda, and Flores became eligible for parole in July 1979, but none had applied for parole because of their political beliefs.Jimmy Carter: Puerto Rican Nationalists Announcement of the President's Commutation of Sentences Upon their return to Puerto Rico, these activists were received as heroes by their supporters and independence groups. The Governor of Puerto Rico Carlos Romero Barcel√≥ publicly opposed the pardons granted by Carter, stating that it would encourage terrorism and undermine public safety. Collazo's wife, Rosa, had been arrested at the time of the assassination attempt by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on suspicion of having conspired with her husband. She spent eight months in federal prison. Upon her release from prison, Rosa Collazo continued to work with the Nationalist Party. She helped gather 100,000 signatures in an effort to save her husband from the electric chair.

During the First World War, at his own request, he served as a non-commissioned officer in the army on the Western front, distinguished himself in battle, was wounded, and was highly decorated. Wirth was awarded the Iron Cross First Class, Iron Cross Second Class, and the Order of the Crown (W√ºrttemberg). After the war Wirth returned to Stuttgart in June 1919 and was promoted back to police detective sergeant a short time later. Family Wirth married Maria Bantel and fathered two children. Early Nazi career Wirth was one of the original members of the Nazi Party, joining for the first time in 1923, before it was outlawed briefly in Germany following the unsuccessful Hitler Beer Hall Putsch.Klee, Ernst: Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich.

The Origins of Nazi Genocide: From Euthanasia to the Final Solution, Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, pp. 203-204; He again joined the Nazi Party as an \\"old fighter\\" on 1 January 1931 (#420,383).Klee, Ernst, Dressen, Willi, Riess, Volker The Good Old Days: The Holocaust as Seen by Its Perpetrators and Bystanders. . He joined the Sturmabteilung (SA) on 30 June 1933. From 7 December 1937 he was a volunteer of the Sicherheitsdienst (SD). On 10 August 1939, Wirth transferred from the SA to the SS, attaining the rank of Obersturmf√ºhrer (First Lieutenant) by October (SS #354,464). After the Nazi party rose to power in Germany, Wirth served in the W√ºrttemberg police force. He had joined the uniformed police (Orpo) in 1910 before the onset of World War I. Wirth rose to become the captain of detectives () of the Kriminalpolizei (Kripo) in Stuttgart. Aktion T4 Memorial plaque, Herbert- von-Karajan-Stra√üe 1 in Berlin-Tiergarten, Germany At the end of 1939, Wirth, along with other Kripo police officers, was detached from the police for service with the Action T4 euthanasia program. These police officers served as nonmedical supervisors at the killing centers of the euthanasia program, and Wirth was chief among them. At the age of fifty-five, Wirth was among the oldest personnel involved in T-4. Wirth first set up office procedures at the \\"euthanasia\\" center at Grafeneck Castle in W√ºrttemberg. Shortly thereafter Wirth was transferred to administrative director of the euthanasia institution at Brandenburg an der Havel in Prussia (the medical director was Dr. Irmfried Eberl). In December 1939 or January 1940, Wirth was present when twenty to thirty German mental patients were subjected to the first known gassing experiment using carbon monoxide. At Brandenburg Euthanasia Centre, the idea to disguise the gas chambers as shower rooms was introduced. Wirth continued to participate as a troubleshooter in the T-4 killing centers. For instance, when at Brandenburg a group of suspecting mental patients refused to enter the (disguised) gas chamber, Wirth coaxed them into the room by telling them that they had to enter it in order to receive clothing.Henry Friedlander (1995). The Origins of Nazi Genocide: From Euthanasia to the Final Solution, Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, p. 96; But Wirth's most intimate connection with T-4 was at Hartheim, where he was chief of the office staff and director of personnel. At Hartheim, Wirth oversaw paperwork as head of the registry office, directed the killing process as the individual responsible for security, and commanded the junior staff as director of personnel. Wirth was coarse and brutal, feared by his subordinates and known to use any means necessary to ensure a smooth killing operation. When four female patients at Hartheim were suspected of having contracted typhus, Wirth shot them to prevent the spread of disease to the staff. Wirth's responsibility for killing Jews began in September 1940, when handicapped Jews were first gassed at Brandenburg. In mid-1940, Wirth was appointed as an inspector of a dozen euthanasia institutions in the Third Reich. He frequented Hartheim Euthanasia Centre, where Franz Stangl worked. Stangl, who was later the commandant of the Sobib√≥r and Treblinka extermination camps, described Wirth in a 1971 interview: > Wirth was a gross and florid man. My heart sank when I met him. He stayed at > Hartheim for several days that time and often came back. Whenever he was > there he addressed us daily at lunch. And here it was again this awful > verbal crudity: when he spoke about the necessity of this euthanasia > operation, he was not speaking in humane or scientific terms, the way Dr. > Werner at T-4 had described it to me. He laughed. He spoke of 'doing away > with useless mouths', and that 'sentimental slobber' about such people made > him 'puke'.Sereny, Gitta, Into That Darkness: from Mercy Killing to Mass > Murder, a study of Franz Stangl, the commandant of Treblinka (1974, second > edition 1995). Page 54 in the Dutch version of the book. In mid-1941, Wirth was involved in the euthanasia program in western areas of Poland; his activity during this time is obscure. In August 1941 Wirth was transferred out of T-4. He was appointed to be Commandant of the newly built Che≈Çmno extermination camp. In September, Wirth was sent to Che≈Çmno to start gassing Jews and Gypsies there. By late March 1942, gassing of Jews and Gypsies was conducted daily in gas vans at Che≈Çmno. Aktion Reinhard After the T-4 Euthanasia program was terminated due to an outcry from the German church, Nazi leadership came up with the \\"Final Solution to the Jewish Question\\". The first phase of the \\"Final Solution\\" was Operation Reinhard (), headed by Odilo Globocnik. The first out of three Aktion Reinhard extermination camps was Be≈Ç≈ºec. Since Wirth had previous experience in killing with gas in the forced euthanasia program, Globocnik appointed him as the commandant of Be≈Ç≈ºec in December 1941. Belzec became fully operational for gassing on or about 17 March 1942. > Before coming to Belzec, Wirth became acquainted with the gas vans in > operation in Che≈Çmno and in the eastern occupied territories of the Soviet > Union and learned their advantages and disadvantages. This experience in > euthanasia, where permanent gas chambers had existed, and with the gas vans > inspired his solution. He decided to combine in Belzec the permanent gas > chamber with the internal combustion car engine as gas supplier. Wirth > objected to the bottles of carbon monoxide gas that had been used in > euthanasia institutions. The bottles, which were produced in private > factories and which would be supplied to Belzec in large quantities, could > arouse suspicion. In addition, the factories were located at great distances > from Belzec and the steady supply of the bottles might cause a logistical > problem. Wirth preferred to set up a self-contained extermination system, > based on an ordinary car engine and easily available gasoline and not > dependent on supply by outside factors... > Wirth carried out experiments to determine the most efficient method of > handling the transports of Jews from the time of their arrival at the camp > until their murder and burial. He developed some basic concepts for the > process of extermination and for camp structure. The basic structure of the > camp and the various actions the victims were made to do as soon as they > left the train were intended to ensure that they would not grasp the fact > that they had been brought for extermination. The aim was to give the > victims the impression that they had arrived at a labor camp or a transit > camp from where they would be sent to a labor camp. The deportees were to > believe this until they were closed into the gas chambers camouflaged as > baths. The second principle of the extermination process was that everything > should be carried out with the utmost speed. The victims should be rushed, > made to run, so that they had no time to look round, to reflect, or to > understand what was going on. This also supported the basic principle of > deceiving the victims. They should be shocked, and their reactions paralyzed > in order to prevent escape or resistance. The speed of the extermination > process served yet an additional purpose: it increased the killing capacity > of the camp. More transports could be brought and annihilated in one day. > According to Wirth's annihilation scheme, the Jews themselves should carry > out all physical work involved in the extermination process of a > transport...Yitzhak Arad (1987). Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka: The Operation > Reinhard Death Camps, Bloomington: Indiana University Press, pp. 24-27. Christian Wirth as SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer Fellow SS man Erich Fuchs described his impression of Wirth from his brief interaction with him during T4 and at Belzec: > Polizeihauptmann [police captain] Christian Wirth conducted the Aktionen in > Bernburg. Subordinate to him were the burners, disinfectors and drivers. He > also supervised the transportation of the mentally ill and of the corpses. > One day in the winter of 1941 Wirth arranged a transport [of euthanasia > personnel] to Poland. I was picked together with about eight or ten other > men and transferred to Belzec... I don't remember the names of the others. > Upon our arrival in Belzec, we met Friedel Schwarz and the other SS men, > whose names I cannot remember. They supervised the construction of barracks > that would serve as a gas chamber. Wirth told us that in Belzec \\"all the > Jews will be struck down.\\" For this purpose barracks were built as gas > chambers. I installed shower heads in the gas chambers. The nozzles were not > connected to any water pipes; they would serve as camouflage for the gas > chamber. For the Jews who were gassed it would seem as if they were being > taken to baths and for disinfection.Yitzhak Arad (1987). Belzec, Sobibor, > Treblinka: The Operation Reinhard Death Camps, Bloomington: Indiana > University Press, p. 24 On 1 August 1942, Globocnik appointed him to the post of Inspector of Aktion Reinhard camps, which would grant Wirth overall command of the Sobib√≥r and Treblinka death camps as well. Wirth's official title in this capacity was Abteilung Reinhard ‚Äì Der Inspekteur des SS-Sonderkommandos beim SS- und Polizeif√ºhrer Lublin. Wirth was noted for his unusually brutal rule. He established the regime of terror and death which was carried out in all Operation Reinhard camps more than any other camp commander. During his time at Be≈Ç≈ºec, Wirth experimented with different methods to most efficiently deal with prisoners. He developed much of the systematic policy for interaction with the prisoners. For instance, Wirth decided that newly arrived prisoners to be murdered should be beaten with whips incessantly to drive them into the gas chambers, thus creating a sense of panic and terror in which the prisoners felt forced to comply. Such policies were soon implemented at the other death camps.Franz Stangl interviewShoah (documentary film) (1985). SS- Unterscharf√ºhrer (Corporal) Franz Suchomel testified about Wirth: > From my activity in the camps of Treblinka and Sobibor, I remember that > Wirth in brutality, meanness, and ruthlessness could not be surpassed. We > therefore called him 'Christian the Terrible' or 'The Wild Christian'. The > Ukrainian guardsmen called him 'Stuka'. The brutality of Wirth was so great > that I personally see it as a perversity. I remember particularly that on > each occasion, Wirth lashed Ukrainian guardsmen with the whip he always > kept...Yitzhak Arad. Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka: the Operation Reinhard > death camps, p. 183-186. Indiana University Press, Bloomington, 1987. > If only someone had had the courage to kill Christian Wirth ‚Äî then Aktion > Reinhard would have collapsed. Berlin would not have found another man with > such energy for evil and nastiness.Tregenza, Michael. Christian Wirth: > Inspekteur der Sonderkommandos, Aktion Reinhard. Vol. XV, Lublin 1993, p. 7. During the construction of Sobib√≥r, the second Aktion Reinhard camp, Wirth visited the incomplete site, and conducted an experimental gassing of 25 Jewish slave-labourers. He liked to carry a whip, and he used it on both Jewish victims and guards. When Treblinka (the last and most efficient Reinhard camp) was set up, Wirth took a direct role in reorganizing it when the first Commandant, Dr. Irmfried Eberl, was replaced by Franz Stangl. Stangl recalled one of Wirth's inspection visits to Treblinka as Inspector of Operation Reinhard, around September 1942: > To tell the truth, one did become used to it... they were cargo. I think it > started the day I first saw the Totenlager [extermination area] in > Treblinka. I remember Wirth standing there, next to the pits full of black- > blue corpses. It had nothing to do with humanity ‚Äî it could not have. It was > a mass ‚Äî a mass of rotting flesh. Wirth said 'What shall we do with this > garbage?' I think unconsciously that started me thinking of them as cargo. In May 1943, after Himmler's visit to Sobib√≥r and Treblinka, Wirth was promoted to the rank of SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer (Major). On 3 November 1943, after the Sobib√≥r uprising, SS and police units shot all of the Jewish labor forces still incarcerated at Trawniki, Poniatowa, and Majdanek concentration camps during Aktion Erntefest (\\"Operation Harvest Festival\\"); 42,000 prisoners in all. When Operation Reinhard was terminated after three million Polish Jews and thousands of Gypsies were murdered, Wirth was sent to Trieste in Italy along with the other former Aktion Reinhard staff. From autumn 1943, Wirth's role was to oversee the Risiera di San Sabba concentration camp as well as to combat partisans over the border in occupied Yugoslavia. He commanded SS Task Force R, which engaged in antipartisan and anti-Jewish actions in the Trieste- Fiume-Udine area of northern Italy. The Jews of this area were to be concentrated at San Sabba and eventually killed. Upon Wirth's order a crematorium was built at San Sabba.Yitzhak Arad (1987). Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka: The Operation Reinhard Death Camps, Bloomington: Indiana University Press, pg. 399. Allegedly to remove potential future witnesses, their superiors assigned former death camp staff to the most dangerous job they could find: anti-partisan combat. While in prison in 1971, Stangl stated in an interview, \\"We were an embarrassment to our [superiors]. They wanted to find ways and means to 'incinerate' us.\\"Sereny, Gitta. Into That Darkness: An Examination of Conscience. Vintage, 1983. Wirth was killed in May 1944 by Yugoslav Partisans while travelling in an open-topped car on an official trip to Fiume. He was buried with full military honours in the German Military Cemetery in Opcina, near Trieste. His remains were transferred in 1959 to the block 15, tomb 716 of the German Military Cemetery at Costermano, near Lake Garda, northern Italy.

Sometimes described as a postmodern apocalyptic epic, the poem was published in three volumes from 1976 to 1980, and as one volume \\"with a new coda\\" by Atheneum (Charles Scribner's Sons) in 1982 (). Already established in the 1970s among the finest lyric poets of his generation, Merrill made a surprising detour by incorporating extensive occult messages into his work (although a poem from the 1950s, \\"Voices from the Other World\\", was the first to quote such \\"otherworldly\\" voices). With his partner David Jackson, Merrill spent more than 20 years transcribing purportedly supernatural communications during s√©ances using a ouija board. Merrill published his first ouija board narrative cycle in 1976, with a poem for each of the letters A through Z, calling it The Book of Ephraim.

The son of silent film stars Denver Dixon and Dolores Booth, Adamson began his career in the film industry at a young age and began directing in the early 1960s, in total helming 33 feature films.McCarty, John (1995). The Sleaze Merchants. St. Martin's Griffin Press. . Page 91Sherman, Sam (2001). Blood of Ghastly Horror (DVD liner notes). Troma Entertainment. #9026. Many of his films, such as Psycho A-Go-Go, Blood of Ghastly Horror, and Dracula vs. Frankenstein, went on to gain cult status. After marrying his long-time star Regina Carrol, Adamson retired from filmmaking to pursue a career in real estate. In 1995, Adamson was murdered by a live-in contractor whom he had hired to work on his house, and subsequently buried beneath his floor. His death and the subsequent trial led to renewed publicity, and was the subject of several true crime television documentaries. Early life Albert Victor Adamson Jr. was born in Hollywood, California. His father was silent film star and producer Denver Dixon, and his mother was actress Dolores Booth. Adamson was involved in the film industry from an early age, appearing in the 1935 film Desert Mesa, directed by his father.  Film career  After assisting his father in making the 1961 western Halfway to Hell, where he served as an uncredited co-director,Ray, Fred Olen (1991). The New Poverty Row. McFarland and Co. Inc. . Page 105 Adamson decided to work in the motion picture industry himself full-time. His father introduced him to a young aspiring film distributor named Sam Sherman in September 1962, and they worked together on various film projects during the 1960s. In 1969, Adamson and Sherman founded Independent-International Pictures (in partnership with Dan Kennis), which became the distributor for the many movies he directed, such as Blood of Ghastly Horror, Satan's Sadists and Dracula vs. Frankenstein. Adamson and Sherman were early collaborators of cinematographers Vilmos Zsigmond and L√°szl√≥ Kov√°cs, who would later find widespread mainstream success and acclaim as figureheads of the New Hollywood film movement. Adamson and Sherman hired Zsigmond, whom they nicknamed \\"Ziggy\\", because the young filmmaker owned his own equipment, including an 35mm Arriflex film camera and a Techniscope lens, which he carried around in a van. Zsigmond had an arrangement with his close friend Kov√°cs where the two would recommend each other to directors, both claiming the other was the superior cinematographer. Their collaboration continued until 1971, when Zsigmond was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Cinematography for Robert Altman's McCabe & Mrs. Miller. Denver Dixon also introduced Sam Sherman to producer Irwin Pizor, and Pizor, in turn, introduced Sherman to Kane W. Lynn and Eddie Romero of Hemisphere Pictures, and working together over the years, they all achieved successful careers in film production and distribution. Al Adamson developed a repertory company as the years rolled on, with a lot of the same actors turning up repeatedly in his films, such as Scott Brady, Kent Taylor, Robert Dix, John Cardos, Gary Kent, John Carradine, and Russ Tamblyn, among others. When a friend in the business sold Sherman the rights to an unfinished Filipino horror movie, he let Adamson shoot additional footage which was inserted into the film and starred Robert Dix, Vicki Volante, and John Carradine to pad out the running time. The film was re-titled Horror of the Blood Monsters, and noted comic book artist Neal Adams designed a lurid poster for it, which helped sell the film to drive-in theaters. Since the original film was in black-and-white, Adamson had the whole film tinted in various colors and advertised the film as being made in a new process called Spectrum X.McCarty, John (1995). The Sleaze Merchants. St. Martin's Griffin Press. . Page 93 Sherman also hired artist Gray Morrow to design a number of their horror film posters, all of which were very graphic and \\"over the top\\". Adamson even created a western-horror hybrid film with his Five Bloody Graves (1969), which starred Robert Dix, John Carradine and Scott Brady, and inserted a number of ultra-violent scenes (savage Indian attacks, rapes, shootings and torture) into what would have just been a mediocre western, and even included narration scenes, with actor Gene Raymond playing \\"Death\\".McCarty, John (1995). The Sleaze Merchants. St. Martin's Griffin Press. . Page 96 Adamson even filmed some of his movies at the Spahn Ranch in California (the adopted home of the notorious Charles Manson cult) such as The Female Bunch (1969) and Angels' Wild Women (1972).  Later career  In 1975, with the biker film genre fizzling out, Sam Sherman talked Adamson into directing some softcore porn films to cash in on the then-popular stewardess film craze, The Naughty Stewardesses, followed by Blazing Stewardesses the same year. They hired old- time western stars Bob Livingston and Don \\"Red\\" Barry to star. Material was written for the Three Stooges, but they had to pass due to poor health.McCarty, John (1995). The Sleaze Merchants. St. Martin's Griffin Press. . Page 99 Adamson considered their 1974 film Girls For Rent (a.k.a. I Spit on Your Corpse) a low point in their association, featuring porn actress Georgina Spelvin raping, and then killing, a mentally disabled man in one scene. Jessie's Girls was Adamson's take on the then-successful Raquel Welch film Hannie Caulder.McCarty, John (1995). The Sleaze Merchants. St. Martin's Griffin Press. . Page 100 His last major film was the 1978 film Nurse Sherri, a horror film about a nurse who is possessed by the ghost of a woman who died during a surgical procedure, and is driven to avenge the dead woman by killing all of the doctors who were involved in her death.McCarty, John (1995). The Sleaze Merchants. St. Martin's Griffin Press. . Page 102 Adamson largely retired from filmmaking in the early 1980s, with he and his wife focusing on a career in real estate. Adamson continued to write scripts however, including one whose premise involved a man being murdered and buried beneath his own house over a financial dispute. This very scenario would be eerily reflected in his own death years later. Personal life Al Adamson's wife, the actress Regina Carrol, performed in many of his films. She met him in 1969 when he was casting Satan's Sadists, in which she starred, and they were married in 1972. Adamson said Regina was a waitress in a cafe at which he was having lunch, and hearing he was a movie director, she spilled a cup of coffee in his lap to get his attention. She died in 1992 from cancer at age 49. Adamson had spent several years trying desperately to save her from the disease, to no avail. He himself was murdered three years after his wife died. Murder Al Adamson was reported missing in 1995. Five weeks later, after law enforcement officials discovered his remains beneath the concrete and tile-covered floor where his hot tub once sat at his home in Indio, California, his live-in contractor Fred Fulford was arrested at the Coral Reef Hotel in Saint Petersburg, Florida. Adamson had hired Fulford to repair his house, which he intended to flip. He had given Fulford a credit card to use to purchase supplies, which Fulford quickly overspent and abused. Adamson had several confrontations with Fulford, the last of which ended violently in his death. Fulford subsequently buried his body in his hot tub and covered it with concrete and tile. Adamson's housekeeper quickly became suspicious over his disappearance and the cover-up of the hot tub, which led investigators to Fulford and the uncovering. Fulford was charged with and convicted of murder, and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. Regular Adamson actor and stuntman Gary Kent testified in the trial as the last person to speak to the director prior to the murder. The case of Al Adamson's murder is documented in the Investigation Discovery television series' Forensic Detectives (ep. \\"Buried Secrets\\"), The New Detectives (season 07, episode 11), and A Stranger in My Home (season 02, episode 06, \\"Death's Final Cut\\"). Blood & Flesh: The Reel Life and Ghastly Death of Al Adamson, a full-length documentary released by Severin Films, covers the entirety of Adamson's life, film career, and untimely death. The documentary is included in Severin‚Äôs blu-ray boxed set career retrospective of Adamson's work.

It was the most important city on the Incense Route after Petra, between the 1st century BCE and the 7th century CE. It was founded in the 3rd century BCE, and inhabited by Nabataeans, Romans, and Byzantines.Yedioth Ahronoth (6 October 2009). \\"Avdat National Park vandalized\\". Retrieved on April 3, 2012. Avdat was a seasonal camping ground for Nabataean caravans travelling along the early Petra‚ÄìGaza road (Darb es-Sultan) in the 3rd ‚Äì late 2nd century BCE. The city's original name was changed to Avdat in honor of Nabataean King Obodas I, who, according to tradition, was revered as a deity and was buried there.Nabataea: Early History. Retrieved on April 3, 2012. History Temple of Oboda Before the end of the 1st century BCE a temple platform (the acropolis) was created along the western edge of the plateau. Recent excavations have shown that the town continued to be inhabited by the Nabataeans continuously from this period until its destruction by earthquake in the early 7th century CE. Sometime towards the end of the 1st century BCE the Nabataeans began using a new route between the site of Moyat Awad in the Arabah valley and Avdat by way of Makhtesh Ramon. Nabataean or Roman Nabataean sites have been found and excavated at Moyat Awad (mistakenly identified as Moa of the 6th century CE Madeba Map), Qatzra, Har Masa, Mezad Nekarot, Sha'ar Ramon (Khan Saharonim), Mezad Ma'ale Mahmal and Grafon. Avdat continued to prosper as a major station along the Petra-Gaza road after the Roman annexation of Nabataea in 106 CE. Avdat, like other towns in the central Negev highlands, adjusted to the cessation of international trade through the region in the early to mid 3rd century by adopting agriculture, and particularly the production of wine, as its means of subsistence. Numerous terraced farms and water channels were built throughout the region in order to collect enough run-off from winter rains to support agriculture in the hyper-arid zone of southern Palestine. At least five wine presses dated to the Byzantine period have been found at the site.ael In the late 3rd or early 4th century (probably during the reign of Diocletian) the Roman army constructed an army camp measuring 100 x 100 m. on the northern side of the plateau. Elsewhere at the site, an inscription was found in the ruins of a tower describing the date (293/294 CE) and the fact that one of the builders hailed from Petra. Around this time a bath house was constructed on the plain below the site. The bath house was supplied with water by way of a well, tunneled 70 meters through bedrock. Sites along the Petra-Gaza road were apparently used by the Roman army in the 4th and 5th centuries when the road continued to function as an artery between Petra and the Nabataean Negev settlements. Pottery and coins from the late 3rd to the early 5th century have been found at Mezad Ma'ale Mahmal, Shar Ramon and Har Masa and Roman milestones line part of the road between Avdat and Shar Ramon. A fort with four corner towers was constructed on the ruins of early Nabataean structures north of Avdat at Horvat Ma'agora. Milestones have been found on along the Petra Gaza road north at Avdat between Avdat and Horvat Ma'agora and further up the road towards Halutza (Elusa). The early town was heavily damaged by a major (probably local) earthquake, sometime in the early 5th century CE. In the ruins of this destruction a Nabataean inscription, in black ink on plaster, was found bearing a blessing of the Nabataean god, Dushara. The inscription was written by the plasterer, one Ben-Gadya. This is the latest Nabataean inscription ever found in Palestine. Avdat earthquake damage A wall was built around the later town, including a large area of man-made caves, some of which were partially inhabited in the Byzantine period. Under Byzantine rule, in 5th and 6th century, a citadel and a monastery with two churches were built on the acropolis of Avdat. Saint Theodore's Church is the most interesting Byzantine relic in Avdat. Marble tombstones inserted in the floor are covered with Greek inscriptions. St. Theodore was a Greek martyr of the 4th century. The Monastery stands next to the church and nearby a lintel is carved with lions and it marks the entrance to the castle. Historical sites=Temple of Oboda Temple Layout The building complex known as The Temple of Oboda sits on the acropolis of the city. The temple was built as a dedication to the deified Nabataean king Obodas I. The temple stands adjacent to the east of two other buildings: a Christian chapel and a second temple known as the ‚Äúwestern temple.‚Äù The temple dedicated to the cult of Obodas the King was built with a hard-limestone in the year 9 BCE during the reign of Obodas II. The temple is a tripartite structure: consisting of a porch, hall and adytum; its overall dimensions are . The building was divided into four rooms. The first and second rooms were unequal subdivisions of the adytum (debir), the first room is the eastern room which is the smaller of the two measuring at . The second room was the western room and the larger of the two rooms measuring . The third room was the hall (hekhal), an oblong shape measuring , which is now completely covered by a Talus. The fourth room is the porch (‚Äòulam) divided into two compartments one facing west measuring approximately and the other facing east measuring approximately were divided by a wall.Negev, Avraham. The Architecture of Oboda: Final Report. Jerusalem, Israel: Institute of Archaeology, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1997. Print A worshiper entered through the porch, which faces south, proceeded through the hall to the rooms of the adytum at the northern end. The worshiper then turned about face toward south to worship the images of the deities placed in niches in the wall. The western room contained two niches which may have contained the images of two Nabataean gods Allat and Dushura. The other room contained a larger single niche where it is believed the defied image of Obodas the King was worshiped. The temple was built to be his eternal resting place and the center of worship for his cult.The Temple of Obodas: Excavations at Oboda in July 1989 Avraham Negev Israel Exploration Journal, Vol. 41, No. 1/3 (1991), pp. 62-80 Published by: Israel Exploration Society Article Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/27926214 Today Avdat was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in June 2005, but on 4 October 2009 the site suffered extensive damage when hundreds of artifacts were smashed and paint smeared on walls and an ancient wine press. Two Bedouin men were later indicted for causing NIS 8.7m worth ($2.3 million) of damages to the site. The men sought to avenge the demolition of a nearby relatives' home by Israeli authorities.

History Burial mound plaque Literally translated from French as \\"The Love Cove,\\" L'Anse Amour is a corruption of an earlier name, L'Anse aux Morts, which means \\"The Cove of the Dead.\\" Human settlement in the area dates back at least 7,500 years as evidenced by the burial mound of a Maritime Archaic boy here. His body was wrapped in a shroud of bark or hide and placed face down with his head pointed to the west. A sign at the site describes the significance of the burial mound and reproductions of artifacts found there are located at the Labrador Straits Museum in L'Anse au Loup, Labrador. The burial mound site was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1978. Icebergs and a narrow passage make the Strait of Belle Isle a hazardous body of water. However, the route provided a shortcut between the United Kingdom and larger ports such as Montreal, Quebec. HMS Raleigh aground The wreck of one of the ships to go aground in the passage, HMS Raleigh, is located near Point Amour. A trail along the shore allows visitors to see the rusting remains of the ship, which went aground on August 8, 1922 and was demolished by explosives in 1926. Attractions L'Anse Amour was nominated in a 2007 CBC Seven Wonders of Canada competition. The nomination cited the very small friendly population of the community and many attractions of the area.

The Au√üenalster was the part of the lake that was \\"outside\\" the city walls, built in 1625. In 1804 city wall and ramparts were stripped down and re-naturalized to parks, but the spatial division between the two lakes was retained. Today, two car and rail bridges, the Lombardsbr√ºcke and the Kennedybr√ºcke, span the river at this location. The areas around the Au√üenalster developed slightly different on the eastern and western sides; while the western side became a wealthy suburban area around the late 18th century, much of the eastern side used to be a property of the finance department of the City of Hamburg and only developed in the later decades of the 19th century.  Geography  The Au√üenalster has a size of Source: statistical office Nord of Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein (2006) and is on average only some deep. It is fed by the rivers Alster, Osterbek (via Osterbekkanal) and Wandse (via Mundsburger Kanal). Other canals entering the Au√üenalster include Rondeelkanal, Goldbekkanal and Uhlenhorster Kanal. The lake also forms a number of smaller bays and inlets. The Alster River enters the Au√üenalster in the North at Krugkoppelbr√ºcke and leaves it in the South at Kennedybr√ºcke.  Location  Districts bordering the Au√üenalster are Harvestehude and Rotherbaum on the western shore, and Winterhude, Uhlenhorst, Hohenfelde and St. Georg on the eastern shore. Many of the streets around Au√üenalster are among the most desirable addresses in Hamburg. St. Georg, as part of Hamburg-Mitte, has a notably denser built environment; all other districts around Au√üenalster are primarily residential districts, with many of the villas around the lake also being used by various organizations or small professional businesses. Alsterufer and Harvestehuder Weg on the western shore include a number of consular missions, like the U.S. Consulate General. For its proximity to the inner city and its recreational qualities, the Au√üenalster is location of a number of hotels: among others, five-star superior Hotel Atlantic lies near the south-eastern bay of Au√üenalster; another hotel of the same category is currently under construction at Fontenay on the western shore.  Festivals, recreation and sport  Kirschbl√ºtenfest Fireworks  Festivals  Usually during May, the Japanese community in Hamburg organizes the annual Kirschbl√ºtenfest (Cherry Blossom Festival) around Au√üenalster.

Formerly private gardens on the western side were made public while Hamburg was host to the Internationale Gartenbauausstellung (International Horticulture Show, IGA) in 1953. The banks vary from a small strip of green to large public parks (e.g. the Alstervorland). The long pathway around the lake is very popular for joggers.  Water sports  Sailing on Au√üenalster Because of frequently occurring gusts, the lake is considered no easy sailing area. The Alster's water is regularly tested for quality, and considered \\"very clean\\" by German standards. Nevertheless, swimming is not recommended, because of the density of watercrafts and an oftentimes shallow vision. A number of famous, long-standing sailing and rowing clubs are based around Au√üenalster: like Der Hamburger und Germania Ruder Club (est. 1836), Ruderclub Allemannia (est. 1866), Norddeutscher Regatta Verein (est. 1868) or Hamburger Segel-Club (est. 1926).

Trained at the Gallup research organisation, he attributed the success of his campaigns to meticulous research into consumer habits. Early life (1911‚Äì1938) David Mackenzie Ogilvy was born on 23 June 1911 at West Horsley, Surrey in England. His mother was Dorothy Blew Fairfield (1881-1942), daughter of Arthur Rowan Fairfield, a civil servant from Ireland. His father, Francis John Longley Ogilvy, (1866 - 1943) was a stockbroker. He was a first cousin once removed of the writer Rebecca West and of Douglas Holden Blew Jones, who was the brother-in-law of Freda Dudley Ward and the father-in-law of Antony Lambton, 6th Earl of Durham. Ogilvy attended St Cyprian's School, Eastbourne, on reduced fees because of his father's straitened circumstances and won a scholarship at age thirteen to Fettes College, in Edinburgh. In 1929, he again won a scholarship, this time in History to Christ Church, Oxford. Without the scholarships, Ogilvy would not have been able to attend Fettes or Oxford University because his father's business was badly hit by the depression of the mid-1920s. His studies were not successful, however, and he left Oxford for Paris in 1931 where he became an apprentice chef in the Hotel Majestic. After a year, he returned to Scotland and started selling AGA cooking stoves, door-to-door. His success at this marked him out to his employer, who asked him to write an instruction manual, The Theory and Practice of Selling the AGA Cooker, for the other salesmen. Thirty years later, Fortune magazine editors called it the finest sales instruction manual ever written. After seeing the manual, Ogilvy's older brother Francis Ogilvy‚Äîthe father of actor Ian Ogilvy‚Äîshowed the manual to management at the London advertising agency Mather & Crowther where he was working. They offered the younger Ogilvy a position as an account executive.  At Gallup (1938‚Äì1948) In 1938, Ogilvy persuaded his agency to send him to the United States for a year, where he went to work for George Gallup's Audience Research Institute in New Jersey. Ogilvy cites Gallup as one of the major influences on his thinking, emphasizing meticulous research methods and adherence to reality. During World War II, Ogilvy worked for the British Intelligence Service at the British embassy in Washington, DC. There he analyzed and made recommendations on matters of diplomacy and security. According to a biography produced by Ogilvy & Mather, \\"he extrapolated his knowledge of human behaviour from consumerism to nationalism in a report which suggested 'applying the Gallup technique to fields of secret intelligence.'\\" Eisenhower‚Äôs Psychological Warfare Board picked up the report and successfully put Ogilvy‚Äôs suggestions to work in Europe during the last year of the war. Also during World War II David Ogilvy was a notable alumnus of the secret Camp X, located near the towns of Whitby and Oshawa in Ontario, Canada. According to an article on the:CBC website \\"It was there he mastered the power of propaganda before becoming king of Madison Avenue. Although Ogilvy was trained in sabotage and close combat, he was ultimately tasked with projects that included successfully ruining the reputation of businessmen who were supplying the Nazis with industrial materials.\\" Ogilvy married Sophie Louise Blew Jones. After the war, Ogilvy bought a farm in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania and lived among the Amish. The atmosphere of \\"serenity, abundance, and contentment\\" kept Ogilvy and his wife in Pennsylvania for several years, but eventually he admitted his limitations as a farmer and moved to Manhattan.  The Ogilvy & Mather years (1949‚Äì1973)  Having worked as a chef, researcher, and farmer, Ogilvy now started his own advertising agency with the backing of Mather and Crowther, the London agency being run by his elder brother, Francis, which later acquired another London agency, S.H. Benson. The new agency in New York was called Ogilvy, Benson, and Mather. David Ogilvy had just $6,000 ($59,726.72 in 2016 dollars) in his account when he started the agency. He writes in Confessions of an Advertising Man that, initially, he struggled to get clients. Ogilvy also admitted (referring to the pioneer of British advertising Bobby Bevan, the chairman of Benson): \\"I was in awe of him but Bevan never took notice of me!\\" They would meet later, however. Ogilvy & Mather was built on David Ogilvy's principles; in particular, that the function of advertising is to sell and that successful advertising for any product is based on information about its consumer. He disliked advertisements that had loud patronizing voices, and believed a customer should be treated as intelligent. In 1955, he coined the phrase, \\"The customer is not a moron, she's your wife\\" based on these values. His entry into the company of giants started with several iconic advertising campaigns: former First Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt, did a commercial for Good Luck Margarine in 1959. In his autobiography, Ogilvy On Advertising, he said it had been a mistake to persuade her to do the ad ‚Äì not because it was undignified, but because he had grown to realize that putting celebs in ads is a mistake. \\"The man in the Hathaway shirt\\" with his aristocratic eye patch which used George Wrangel as model; \\"The man from Schweppes is here\\" introduced Commander Edward Whitehead, the elegant bearded Brit, bringing Schweppes (and \\"Schweppervescence\\") to the U.S.; a famous headline in the automobile business, \\"At 60 miles an hour the loudest noise in this new Rolls-Royce comes from the electric clock\\"; \\"Pablo Casals is coming home ‚Äì to Puerto Rico\\", a campaign which Ogilvy said helped change the image of a country, and was his proudest achievement. One of his greatest successes was \\"Only Dove is one-quarter moisturizing cream\\". This campaign helped Dove become the top selling soap in the U.S. Ogilvy believed that the best way to get new clients was to do notable work for his existing clients. Success in his early campaigns helped Ogilvy get big clients such as Rolls-Royce and Shell. New clients followed and Ogilvy's company grew quickly. He was widely hailed as \\"The Father of Advertising\\".\\"New York Times Tribute, 1999 In 1962, Time called him \\"the most sought-after wizard in today's advertising industry\\".Time Magazine cover story, 12 October 1962 In 1973, Ogilvy retired as Chairman of Ogilvy & Mather and moved to Touffou, his estate in France. While no longer involved in the agency's day-to-day operations, he stayed in touch with the company. His correspondence so dramatically increased the volume of mail handled in the nearby town of Bonnes that the post office was reclassified at a higher status and the postmaster's salary raised. Ogilvy & Mather linked with H.H.D Europe in 1972.  Life with WPP and afterward (1989‚Äì1999)  Ogilvy came out of retirement in the 1980s to serve as chairman of Ogilvy, Benson, & Mather in India. He also spent a year acting as temporary chairman of the agency‚Äôs German office, commuting weekly between Touffou and Frankfurt. He visited branches of the company around the world, and continued to represent Ogilvy & Mather at gatherings of clients and business audiences. In 1989, The Ogilvy Group was bought by WPP Group, a British parent company, for US$864 million in a hostile takeover made possible by the fact that the company group had made an IPO as the first company in marketing to do so. During the takeover procedures, Sir Martin Sorrell, the founder of WPP, was described by Ogilvy as an \\"odious little shit\\", and he promised to never work again. (Reports softened it to \\"odious little jerk\\", and when Martin Sorrell signed his next company report, he followed the signature with the letters OLJ.) Two events followed simultaneously, however: WPP became the largest marketing communications firm in the world, and David Ogilvy was named the company's non-executive chairman (a position he held for three years). Eventually he became a fan of Sorrell. A letter of apology from Ogilvy adorns Sorrell's office, which is said to be the only apology David Ogilvy ever offered in any form during his adult life. Only a year after his derogatory comments about Sorrell, he was quoted as saying, 'When he tried to take over our company, I would liked to have killed him. But it was not legal. I wish I had known him 40 years ago. I like him enormously now.' At age seventy-five, Ogilvy was asked if anything he'd always wanted had somehow eluded him. His reply was, \\"Knighthood. And a big family - ten children.\\" His only child, David Fairfield Ogilvy, was born during his first marriage, to Melinda Street. That marriage ended in divorce (1955) as did a second marriage to Anne Cabot. Ogilvy married Herta Lans in France during 1973. Ogilvy was made a Commander of the Order of British Empire (CBE) in 1967. He was elected to the U.S. Advertising Hall of Fame in 1977 and to France's Order of Arts and Letters in 1990.

Mr. Ogilvy was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1979. David Ogilvy died on 21 July 1999 at his home, the Ch√¢teau de Touffou, in Bonnes, France.  Works  His book Ogilvy on Advertising is a general commentary on advertising. His book Confessions of an Advertising Man is a book on advertising. Ogilvy's advertising philosophy followed these four basic principles: * Creative brilliance: had a strong emphasis on the \\"BIG IDEA\\". * Research: coming, as he did, from a background in research, he never underestimated its importance in advertising. In fact, in 1952, when he opened his own agency, he billed himself as research director. * Actual results for clients: \\"In the modern world of business, it is useless to be a creative, original thinker unless you can also sell what you create.\\" * Professional discipline: \\"I prefer the discipline of knowledge to the anarchy of ignorance.\\" He codified knowledge into slide and film presentations he called Magic Lanterns. He also instituted several training programs for young advertising professionals. While Ogilvy was most famous for building and establishing brands, he was primarily interested in direct marketing. He initially built his agency using a direct mail promotion. He ran direct response advertisements in major newspapers to generate leads. In a video titled, \\"We Sell or Else\\", he praised direct marketers and direct marketing while pillorying \\"general\\" or branding advertising, at one point saying that branding people \\"worship at the altar of creativity.\\"  Notes  References  #Ogilvy, D.

Howard (each a member of the Birthday Party) with Robert Forster, Lindy Morrison and Grant McLennan (each a member of the Go-Betweens). Their only release was the 1982 7\\" 45 rpm single \\"After the Fireworks\\", on the Australian label, Au Go Go Records. The lead track was co-written by Cave, Forster and McLennan. Note: For additional work user may have to select 'Search again' and then 'Enter a title:' or 'Performer:' The collaboration came about when the Go-Betweens and the Birthday Party found themselves by happen-stance with overlapping booked studio time at AAV studio, Melbourne. The Birthday Party were having trouble completing their album, Junkyard (May 1982), and the two bands decided to join forces on a song during downtime. The idea to join forces, as well as the lyrics of \\"After the Fireworks\\" are Cave's, while the drums are distinctly Morrison's. The band's name was coined by Cave's then-girlfriend, Anita Lane. The collaboration performed live only once, at Richmond's Tiger Lounge venue doing a cover version of \\"Ring of Fire\\". \\"After the Fireworks\\" was released as a single in the same year by Keith Glass, owner of the label Missing Link, who explained that he did so to recoup money he had lost on the Birthday Party in studio time. > \\"[The Birthday Party] were in AVV.

Instead, he stated that the band members were surprised to learn of its impending release. > \\"That single was like a jam session we had in the studio which lasted about > 2 hours and we never even finished...

The B-side track is named \\"After, After the Fireworks\\". The song is appeared on the CD release of Drunk on the Pope's Blood (the 1982 split LP between the Birthday Party and Lydia Lunch), the Birthday Party's 5‚Äìdisc box set, The Definitive Missing Link Recordings 1979-1982, the second disc of the re-released CD edition of the Go-Betweens' album, Send Me a Lullaby (2002), and on an Australian various artists' compilation album, No Worries, on Hot Records.The Go-Betweens: Discography  Personnel  * Nick Cave ‚Äì lead vocals * Robert Forster ‚Äì guitar * Mick Harvey ‚Äì piano * Rowland S.

This may be a planar mirror or parabolic arrays of solar mirrors used to achieve a substantially concentrated reflection factor for solar energy systems. See article \\"Heliostat\\" for more information on solar mirrors used for terrestrial energy.  Components = Glass or metal substrate  The substrate is the mechanical layer which holds the mirror in shape. Glass may also be used as a protective layer to protect the other layers from abrasion and corrosion. Although glass is brittle, it is a good material for this purpose, because it is highly transparent (low optical losses), resistant to ultraviolet light (UV), fairly hard (abrasion resistant), chemically inert, and fairly easy to clean. It is composed of a float glass with high optical transmission characteristics in the visible and infrared ranges, and is configured to transmit visible light and infrared radiation. The top surface, known as the \\"first surface\\", will reflect some of the incident solar energy, due to the reflection coefficient caused by its index of refraction being higher than air. Most of the solar energy is transmitted through the glass substrate to the lower layers of the mirror, possibly with some refraction, depending on the angle of incidence as light enters the mirror. Metal substrates (\\"Metal Mirror Reflectors\\") may also be used in solar reflectors. NASA Glenn Research Center, for example, used a mirror comprising a reflective aluminum surface on a metallic honeycombNASA Glenn Research Center, 1987 Phase II Small Business Research Program, \\"Improved Mirror Facet,\\" Solar Kinetics, Dallas, TX archived summary as a prototype reflector unit for a proposed power system for the International Space Station. One technology uses aluminum composite reflector panels, achieving over 93% reflectivity and coated with a speciality coating for surface protection. Metal reflectors offer some advantages over glass reflectors, as they are lightweight and stronger than glass and relatively inexpensive. The ability to retain parabolic shape in reflectors is another advantage, and normally the subframe requirements are reduced by more than 300%. The top surface reflection coating allows for better efficiency.  Reflective layer  The reflective layer is designed to reflect the maximum amount of solar energy incident upon it, back through the glass substrate. The layer comprises a highly reflective thin metal film, usually either silver or aluminum, but occasionally other metals. Because of sensitivity to abrasion and corrosion, the metal layer is usually protected by the (glass) substrate on top, and the bottom may be covered with a protective coating, such as a copper layer and varnish. Despite the use of aluminum in generic mirrors, aluminum is not always used as the reflective layer for a solar mirror. The use of silver as the reflective layer is claimed to lead to higher efficiency levels, because it is the most reflective metal. This is because of aluminum's reflection factor in the UV region of the spectrum. Locating the aluminum layer on the first surface exposes it to weathering, which reduces the mirror's resistance to corrosion and makes it more susceptible to abrasion. Adding a protective layer to the aluminum would reduce its reflectivity.  Interference layer  An interference layer may be located on the first surface of the glass substrate. It can be used to tailor the reflectance. It may also be designed for diffuse reflectance of near-ultraviolet radiation, in order to prevent it from passing through the glass substrate. This substantially enhances the overall reflection of near-ultraviolet radiation from the mirror. The interference layer may be made of several materials, depending on the desired refractive index, such as titanium dioxide.  Solar thermal applications  The intensity of solar thermal energy from solar radiation at the surface of the earth is about , of area normal to the direction of the sun, under clear-sky conditions. When solar energy is unconcentrated, the maximum collector temperature is about . This is useful for space heating and heating water. For higher temperature applications, such as cooking, or supplying a heat engine or turbine-electrical generator, this energy must be concentrated.  Terrestrial applications  Solar thermal systems have been constructed to produce concentrated solar power (CSP), for generating electricity.Sandia Labs - CSP Technologies OverviewPowerTower The large design developed by Sandia National Labs The large Sandia Lab solar power tower uses a Stirling engine heated by a solar mirror concentrator.Sandia Lab - Solar Dish Engine Another configuration is the trough system.Sandia Lab - Trough System  Space power application  \\"Solar dynamic\\" energy systems have been proposed for various spacecraft applications, including solar power satellites, where a reflector focuses sunlight on to a heat engine such as the Brayton cycle type.  Photovoltaic augmentation  Photovoltaic cells (PV) which can convert solar radiation directly into electricity are quite expensive per unit area. Some types of PV cell, e.g. gallium arsenide, if cooled, are capable of converting efficiently up to 1,000 times as much radiation as is normally provided by simple exposure to direct sunlight. In tests done by Sewang Yoon and Vahan Garboushian, for Amonix Corp. silicon solar cell conversion efficiency is shown to increase at higher levels of concentration, proportional to the logarithm of the concentration, provided external cooling is available to the photocells. Similarly, higher efficiency multijunction cells also improve in performance with high concentration.G. Landis, D. Belgiovani, and D. Scheiman, ‚ÄúTemperature Coefficient of Multijunction Space Solar Cells as a Function of Concentration,‚Äù 37th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference, Seattle WA, June 19‚Äì24, 2011. Terrestrial application To date no large scale testing has been performed on this concept. Presumably this is because the increased cost of the reflectors and cooling generally is not economically justified. Solar power satellite application Theoretically, for space-based solar power satellite designs, solar mirrors could reduce PV cell costs and launch costs since they are expected to be both lighter and cheaper than equivalent large areas of PV cells. Several options were studied by Boeing corporation. In their Fig. 4. captioned \\"Architecture 4. GEO Harris Wheel\\", the authors describe a system of solar mirrors used to augment the power of some nearby solar collectors, from which the power is then transmitted to receiver stations on earth. Space reflectors for night illumination Another advanced space concept proposal is the notion of space reflectors which reflect sunlight on to small spots on the night side of the Earth to provide night time illumination. An early proponent of this concept was Dr. Krafft Arnold Ehricke, who wrote about systems called \\"Lunetta\\", \\"Soletta\\", \\"Biosoletta\\" and \\"Powersoletta\\". A preliminary series of experiments called Znamya (\\"Banner\\") was performed by Russia, using solar sail prototypes that had been repurposed as mirrors. Znamya-1 was a ground test. Znamya-2 was launched aboard the Progress M-15 resupply mission to the Mir space station on 27 October 1992. After undocked from Mir, the Progress deployed the reflector. This mission was successful in that the mirror deployed, although it did not illuminate the Earth. The next flight Znamya-2.5 failed.BBC, Sci/Tech: Znamya falls to Earth, February 4, 1999 (accessed 2011-08-24) Znamya-3 never flew. In 2018, Chengdu, China, announced plans to place three solar reflectors in orbit around the Earth in hopes of reducing the amount of electricity required to power streetlights. Skepticism has been voiced regarding the technological feasibility of the plan.

The term Siculish is, however, rather recent, being first recorded in 2005.Lambert, James. 2018. A multitude of ‚Äòlishes‚Äô: The nomenclature of hybridity. English World-wide, 39(1): 30. Siculish was used to Sicilianize the names of American places among immigrant communities, such as Bensonhurst, New York becoming nicknamed \\"Bensinosti\\". Indeed, New York itself became known as Nu Iorca. Forms of Siculish are also to be found in other Sicilian immigrant communities of English-speaking countries, namely Canada and Australia. A surprising similarity can often be found between these forms, through either coincidence, trans-national movements of Sicilian immigrants, or more likely, through the logical adaptation of English using linguistic norms from the Sicilian language. Some common Siculish terms and an explanation of their derivation (not necessarily common to all Anglo-speaking countries): * baccausu - Sicilianisation of English words \\"back\\" and \\"house\\", as in \\"out house\\"; referring to the original location of toilet facilities, usually located in the backyard or rear of the home, at the turn of the 20th century before the advent of indoor plumbing; even used today to refer to any functioning bathroom. * bissinissa - Sicilianisation of English word \\"business\\", either referring to a commercial enterprise or family-run shop, or to the personal affairs of an individual, sometimes used jokingly (also found as bissinissi in both singular and plural forms). * bossu - addition of masculine u ending to English word \\"boss\\" * carru - marriage of English \\"car\\" with Sicilian carru meaning \\"cart\\", modern use of existing Sicilian word to suit new environment * brucculinu - Sicilianisation of the New York City borough of \\"Brooklyn\\"; can also refer to any Sicilian (or Italian) who has made it across the ocean to New York, or any of the other surrounding areas heavily populated by Italian immigrants in the northeastern United States. * fenza - sicilianisation of English word \\"fence\\", as in the backyard fence; marriage with Sicilian frinza meaning \\"fringe\\" or \\"border\\" * giobbu - addition of masculine u ending to English word \\"job\\", gi- being the sicilian form of English \\"j\\", with the doubling of the \\"b\\" a common Sicilian linguistic trait (may also be found as giobba, i.e. feminine ending) * iarda - sicilianisation of English \\"yard\\", as in \\"backyard\\" or \\"garden\\", but also Sicilian iardinu means \\"garden\\" * stritta - Sicilianisation of English word \\"street\\" - pronounced s-treeh-tah\\" (its pronunciation is the same of the word that in Sicilian language means \\"narrow\\") * tupicu - sicilianisation of English word \\"toothpick\\" - pronounced too-pee-koo\\" Many children of Sicilian immigrants will often confuse actual Sicilian words for Siculish. This will especially occur where both the Sicilian and English languages have basically the same word derived from Norman. For example, the following are Sicilian words that could be mistaken for being Siculish: anci√≤va means \\"anchovy\\", trubbulu means \\"trouble\\", damaggiu means \\"damage\\", raggia means \\"rage\\", tastari means \\"to taste\\" and truppicari means \\"to trip\\" - but they are examples of Sicilian and English words with the same Norman derivation.
