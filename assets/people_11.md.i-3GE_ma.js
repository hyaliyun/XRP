Originally from Ohio, he traveled west in search of land in 1836. Little is known about Abbe until this time. Abbe Creek, on which he established his homestead, still bears his name today. A one-room school house was established on the homestead site in 1856 and still stands today bearing the name of Abbe Creek School. He died in 1854 in California and was buried in Sacramento.  Life = Settlement and homesteading = Abbe came to eastern Iowa by way of Rock Island, Illinois, in the summer of 1836. He followed the Red Cedar River to the site of the present town of Mt. Vernon, IowaHistory of Lynn County Accessed 2009-07-29 and staked a claim of on what is now known as Abbe Creek. He returned to his home in Lorain County, Ohio, to collect his family and they returned to Iowa in the winter of 1837. The Abbe family crossed the Mississippi River on the ice near Davenport in February to avoid the high tariff charged by Col. Davenport and other river ferrymen. Ferry charges were as high as $25 for a man and his horse. Abbe reached his staked claim in April and immediately cleared the land around the creek with a team of oxen and a breaking plow to cut the prairie sod. Then, Abbe built a floorless cabin 12 by . He covered the cabin with birch bark. Later that fall he built a large double log house with three rooms and an upstairs sleeping loft reached by an inside ladder. Two years after Abbe and his wife, Olive, homesteaded the land, Olive died. She was buried in an unmarked grave near their farm. This area later became Sugar Grove cemetery. In 1840 Abbe married Mary Wolcott. In 1838, Abbe sent two other early settlers, Robert Ellis and Philip Hull, to Muscatine (a trek of over 50 miles by a recent Google Maps directions) for provisions with his last $15. Muscatine, Davenport and Rockingham were the closest trading posts and provisions were expensive. The first two years Abbe hunted and traded with the Indians and spoke the Winnebago language. Later he acted as interpreter for them in dealings with white settlers and trappers. Abbe's children also played with the Winnebagos and spoke the language as well as the Indians. =Social life= Physically, Abbe was a big man who stood more than six feet tall. He was slender and stood straight as an arrow. According to his son, \\"I never saw a horse he could not mount and ride anytime without the least effort.\\" He was very active and often walked in one day through the unbroken prairies and forests. William Abbe's cabin was a popular gathering place for the settlers and immigrants of early Linn County. It was the major stop between Iowa City and Dubuque on the old Military Road. Strangers could always find a good meal and a place to stay with William and Mary Abbe. Mrs. Abbe was known for her good cooking and many people would travel out of their way to stop at their cabin. Their daughter, Susan Abbe, became the first teacher in Cedar Rapids. Telling of their pioneer life, she recalled: \\"Of course we had men come in such as horse thieves, and my father had some of them chained up in one of our rooms for safekeeping until they could be tried, as there was no jail for some time in Linn County.\\" =Politics= Abbe was one of the best known and educated men in the county. He was an old time Democrat and served as state senator representing Cedar, Linn and Jones counties in the 7th and 8th legislatures of Iowa City. He was a Justice of the Peace and later served a short time as sheriff of the county. He helped build the first jail in Marion. Abbe also held the government contracts for the delivery of meat and provisions to the Winnebago Agency at Fort Atkinson and to the troops at Prairie du Chien in Wisconsin. For many years, he was the only person in the county who had a ready supply of money and he loaned it freely to his friends for them to purchase claims. =Goldrush= When gold was discovered in California, Abbe left his family in 1849 for the gold fields where he was a land speculator and teamster. He came back to Iowa in 1851, but left again for California with his son the next year. In 1854, before he could return to Iowa to bring his family to California, Abbe died at age 54. He was buried in Sacramento. His widow, Mary, continued to live in Marion until her death in 1861.

He was a member of five different teams during these seasons; the St. Louis Browns, Washington Nationals, Richmond Virginians, and Baltimore Orioles of the American Association, and the Washington Nationals of the National League. During his playing days, his listed height was 5'10.5\\", and his weight as 165 lbs. In addition to his major league experience, Goldsby also appeared as a both a player and a manager in minor league baseball, most notably for the Topeka Golden Giants of the Western League in 1887. In 1889, while he was a player- manager for a team in Evansville, Illinois, he suffered partial paralysis during a game; acute rheumatism was diagnosed as a cause. He left baseball a short time later, and worked for the railroad. Early life Walton Hugh Goldsby was born on December 31, 1861 in Marion, Louisiana to Irish immigrants. In 1880, he was living with his widowed mother Dottie, a teacher, as a boarder in a hotel located in Prescott, Arkansas. Career He began playing with an amateur baseball club in East St. Louis, Illinois in 1883, and later that year, he began playing professionally with a team in Evansville, Indiana.Sporting News, June 19, 1889 He continued with the team into the 1884 season when he was signed by the St. Louis Browns of the American Association (AA), and made his Major League Baseball debut on May 29, 1884. He played just five games for the Browns, and was released after collecting four hits in 20 at bats for a .200 batting average. He returned to Evansville, but was soon signed by the Washington Nationals of the AA, and he was playing for the team in the latter part of July 1884. On August 2, the Evening Star opined that the Nationals' outfield, now consisting of Goldsby, Frank Olin, and Willie Murphy, had made a significant improvement. Despite the praise, and good play, he was released from the teams after playing in six games and a .375 batting average. He later appeared in 11 games for the Richmond Virginians, and was released from the team in September. After the AA season had completed, he was again playing for Evansville. Goldsby played for the Atlanta Atlantas of the Southern League (SL) during the 1885 minor league baseball season. In 93 games played, he hit six home runs, and had a .291 batting average. He began the 1886 baseball season playing for, and managing, the Nashville Americans of the Southern Association. In August, he issued a fine of $25 to pitcher Ed Dundon, who was a deaf-mute; Goldsby feeling that he had intentionally allowed an opposing player to hit a home run. This turned out to be a very unpopular decision among his team members, as well as the local press. On September 2, it was reported that Goldsby was suffering from a bout of malaria. By the middle of September, he was no longer playing for Nashville, and had signed with the Washington Nationals of the National League. With the Nationals, he played in six games and collected just four hits in 22 at bats for a .222 batting average. Goldsby returned to the minor leagues in 1887, becoming the player-manager of the Topeka Golden Giants of the Western League. He had the best season of his minor league career, batting a .422 average, scored 112 runs, hit 13 doubles, and nine triples. The following season, he continued his role as a player-manager, though he moved to the Birmingham Maroons of the SL. After a meeting of SL officials in New Orleans, it was determined that league would be accepted into the National Agreement and agree to respect the reserve clause. However, the teams were not able to contribute the money necessary to bind the agreement and secure the right to reserve their own players, so many of them decided to take larger offers from other leagues. Goldsby was one of these, and by mid-July, had accepted an offer with the Baltimore Orioles of the AA. He played in 45 games for the Orioles through the remainder of the season, compiled 17 stolen bases, and had a .236 batting average. Though he was listed among the Baltimore players that had been reserved, he never again played in another major league. After being released by the Orioles in March 1889, he joined the Evansville Hoosiers of the Central Interstate League as their player-manager. On June 12, he suffered a bout of partial-paralysis of his right side. He was diagnosed with acute rheumatism, that had affected his brain. He had been playing for weeks while feeling ill, causing him to suffer anxiety. During the previous season, in a game against the Philadelphia Athletics, he was hit the head with a ball, causing him to lose consciousness. He complained of total memory loss of the day. It was thought that this incident could have played a part in his illness. He wouldn't appear again as a player or manager until he appeared in 15 games for the Memphis Giants of the Southern Association in 1892. Later, 1903, he was employed as an alternate umpire with the SL based in Memphis.The Sporting News, May 20, 1903, P. 6 Post-baseball life After Goldsby's baseball career ended, he returned to Arkansas, and was later married. In 1900, he was living with his brother in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. He is listed as a married man for the last seven years, but his wife was not living in the same household. His occupation was an orderly for a railroad. In 1910, he was working as a machinist for a railroad; he was listed as divorced and living in a St. Louis boarding house. On January 11, 1914, Goldsby committed suicide in a Dallas, Texas hotel called the \\"Campbell House\\", by a self-inflicted shot to head with a .45 caliber revolver. He had been registered as a resident of Dallas, and left a lengthy suicide note detailing general despondency. He was survived by his brother, and his son Miles, both of whom lived in Harrisburg, Arkansas.The Dallas Morning News, January 12, 1914 He was a member of the St. Louis chapter of the Knights of the Pythias, and the funeral was held in Dallas by a local Knights lodge on January 12.

In the next generation two Vipstani are known, with the cognomina \\"Messalla\\" and \\"Poplicola\\". This led Ronald Syme to observe that either Lucius or Marcus married a daughter of Marcus Valerius Messalla Messallinus and Claudia Marcella Minor, who is named (for convenience) Valeria Messallia.In Table IX of The Augustan Aristocracy, Syme indicates Lucius Vipstanus Gallus as the husband of Valeria Messallia, but notes the relationship is \\"conjectural\\". This alliance with the gens Valeria led to the prominence of the family during the first centuries of the Roman Empire.

The East River portion of South Dakota refers to the section of the state lying east of the Missouri River. Geographical distinctions between the eastern and western sections of the state were reinforced by differing patterns of European-American settlement and Native American resettlement during the 19th and 20th centuries. The eastern half of South Dakota was heavily glaciated and is largely covered by glacial till and loamy soil, which has lent itself to agricultural uses. The Missouri River roughly follows the 100th meridian in the state, and areas to the west of the meridian receive less rainfall. The East River region was generally capable of supporting homesteaders on the standard 160-acre plots of the era during the wetter-than average years between 1879 and 1885; prolonged droughts between 1886 and 1897, however, severely affected the region's farmers. During the second half of the 19th century, about 350,000 immigrants from western and northern Europe settled to the east of the Missouri. The later European immigrants, however, predominantly from southern and eastern Europe, settled in the West River region after 1889, when the federal government made some 9 million acres of former Lakota land available for purchase after breaking up the Great Sioux Reservation, established under the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868. It reassigned Native Americans to five smaller reservations in West River, and two in East River. About 70% of South Dakota's population in the 1990s was located in the East River region, which includes major businesses, industries and state government. This area includes the state's largest city, Sioux Falls, and Pierre, the state capital, located on the east bank of the Missouri River. Since the 1960s and the rise of Indian activism, numerous Native Americans have returned to the reservations in the state. In addition, they have a young population with a relatively high birth rate. Native Americans make up the fastest-growing segment of the population in the state as a whole.Herbert T.

All Australian jurisdictions give redress when a person is victimised on account of colour, ethnicity, national origin, or race. Some jurisdictions give redress when a person is victimised on account of colour, ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender identity, HIV/AIDS status or sexual orientation. Federal The Racial Discrimination Act 1975 forbids hate speech on several grounds. The Act makes it \\"unlawful for a person to do an act, otherwise than in private, if the act is reasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate another person or a group of people; and the act is done because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of the other person, or of some or all of the people in the group.\\" An aggrieved person can lodge a complaint with the Australian Human Rights Commission. If the complaint is validated, the Commission will attempt to conciliate the matter. If the Commission cannot negotiate an agreement which is acceptable to the complainant, the complainant's only redress is through the Federal Court or through the Federal Circuit Court. In 2002, the Federal Court applied the Act in the case of Jones v Toben. The case involved a complaint about a website which contained material that denied the Holocaust. The Federal Court ruled that the material was a violation of the Act. Section 474.17 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 makes it an offence to use a carriage service such as the Internet in a manner which reasonable persons would regard as menacing, harassing or offensive. Federal criminal law, therefore, is available to address racial vilification where the element of threat or harassment is also present, although it does not apply to material that is merely offensive. http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cca1995115/sch1.html Tasmania The Anti-Discrimination Act 1998 prohibits \\"any conduct which offends, humiliates, intimidates, insults or ridicules another person\\" on the basis of attributes including race, sexual orientation, religion, gender identity and disability. Section 19 of Tasmania's Anti-Discrimination Act 1998 prohibits anyone from inciting hatred. The Act says: :A person, by a public act, must not incite hatred towards, serious contempt for, or severe ridicule of, a person or a group of persons on the ground of ‚Äì ::(a) the race of the person or any member of the group; or ::(b) any disability of the person or any member of the group; or ::(c) the sexual orientation or lawful sexual activity of the person or any member of the group; or ::(d) the religious belief or affiliation or religious activity of the person or any member of the group.  New South Wales  In June 2018, both houses of the Parliament of New South Wales unanimously passed and the Governor of New South Wales signed an urgent bill without amendments called the Crimes Amendment (Publicly Threatening and Inciting Violence) Bill 2018 to repeal the vilification laws within the Anti-Discrimination Act 1977 and replace it with criminal legislation with up to an explicit 3 year term of imprisonment within this Act. The legislation went into effect on August 13, 2018 - by proclamation on August 10, 2018. Back in 1989, by an amendment to the Anti-Discrimination Act 1977, New South Wales became the first state to make it unlawful for a person, by a public act, to incite hatred towards, serious contempt for, or severe ridicule of a person or group on the grounds of race. The amendment also created a criminal offence for inciting hatred, contempt or severe ridicule towards a person or group on the grounds of race by threatening physical harm (towards people or their property) or inciting others to threaten such harm. Prosecution of the offence of serious vilification requires consent from the Attorney General of New South Wales and carries a maximum penalty of a $10,000 fine or 6 months imprisonment for an individual‚Äî$100,000 for a corporation. An offence has not yet been prosecuted under this law. As of 1994, the Anti- Discrimination Act 1977 has had various setbacks in its process to handle complaints such as complaints not being proceeded with due to the lack of evidence in cases and those pursuing the act of discrimination losing interest in their own complaint. Furthermore, due to the nature of discrimination reports in NSW, the Board receives multiple complaints stemming from a single act of vilification and therefore is required to address each complaint separately which can create dissonance between the resolutions desired by each individual or group. Queensland Queensland's Anti-Discrimination Act 1991 and amendments create laws that are similar to Tasmania's. In 2001, the Islamic Council of Queensland brought the first action under the Anti- Discrimination Act for victimisation on account of religion. The Islamic Council complained that the respondent Mr. Lamb, a candidate in a federal election, had expressed some unfavourable opinions about Muslims in an electioneering-pamphlet. Walter Sofronoff, for the Anti-Discrimination Tribunal, dismissed the action on the ground that Mr. Lamb did not intend to incite hatred or contempt but rather wanted to let the electors know his opinions on political matters. Western Australia Unlike other jurisdictions, Western Australian law imposes criminal but not civil sanctions against racial vilification. In Western Australia, the Criminal Code was amended in 1989 to criminalise the possession, publication and display of written or pictorial material that is threatening or abusive with the intention of inciting racial hatred or of harassing a racial group. Penalties range between 6 months and two years imprisonment. The Western Australian legislation only addresses written or pictorial information‚Äînot verbal comments. The emphasis on written material arose in direct response to the racist poster campaigns of the Australian Nationalist Movement in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 2004 the Criminal Code Amendment (Racial Vilification) Act 2004 was passed, making racial vilification punishable by 14 years imprisonment. Victoria On 1 January 2002, Victoria put into effect its Racial and Religious Tolerance Act 2001 which makes religious vilification as well as racial vilification unlawful. Section 8(1) of the Act states: ::A person must not, on the ground of the religious belief or activity of another person or class of persons, engage in conduct that incites hatred against, serious contempt for, or revulsion or severe ridicule of, that other person or class of persons. ::Note: \\"engage in conduct\\" includes use of the internet or e-mail to publish or transmit statements or other material. Section 11 of the Act provides this concession in favour of freedom of expression: ::A person does not contravene section 7 or 8 if the person establishes that the person's conduct was engaged in reasonably and in good faith‚Äî :::(a) in the performance, exhibition or distribution of an artistic work; or :::(b) in the course of any statement, publication, discussion or debate made or held, or any other conduct engaged in, for‚Äî ::::(i) any genuine academic, artistic, religious or scientific purpose; or ::::(ii) any purpose that is in the public interest; or :::(c) in making or publishing a fair and accurate report of any event or matter of public interest. In 2004, the Islamic Council of Victoria laid a complaint under the Act about the preaching by two Christian pastors. One pastor, a man who had fled Pakistan when a charge of blasphemy was made against him there, was Daniel Scot. The other pastor was Danny Nalliah. Scot and Nalliah made controversial remarks about Islam at a seminar.Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, 'Legislating Religious Correctness: Religious vilification laws converge with the Islamist vision of a blasphemy-free society' The Daily Standard 27 October 2005. On 17 December 2004, the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal, in the person of Judge Michael Higgins, determined that the pastors had violated the Act. The judge sentenced them to print an apology‚Äîdrafted by the judge‚Äîon their website, in their newsletter, and in eight advertisements appearing in two newspapers. The pastors appealed. The Supreme Court of Victoria overturned the Tribunal's decision.[2006] VSCA 284 (14 December 2006) The Court said the Tribunal had no business \\"attempt[ing] to assess the theological propriety of what was asserted at the Seminar.\\" The Court directed a re-hearing before a different judge. The pastors and the Islamic Council of Victoria prevented a re-hearing by resolving their conflict through mediation on 22 June 2007. South Australia The Racial Vilification Act 1996 is similar to the law in New South Wales. In 2002, the Attorney- General's Department released a discussion paper entitled 'Proposal for a new law against religious discrimination and vilification.' Following many objections, no legislation was enacted. The Northern Territory The Anti- Discrimination Act 1992 prohibits discrimination and harassment in activities associated with education, work, accommodation, services, clubs, and insurance or superannuation. The Australian Capital Territory The Discrimination Act 1991 is similar to the law in New South Wales. In 2016 the law was amended to include a proscription of actions inciting hatred toward, revulsion of, serious contempt for, or severe ridicule of a person or group of people on the ground of any of the following(a) disability; (b) gender identity; (c) HIV/AIDS status; (d) race; (e) religious conviction; (f) sexuality.Discrimination Amendment Act 2016 (ACT) available at http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/a/2016-49/current/pdf/2016-49.pdf Prior to the passage of these amendments, religion in particular was not included.

It had an authorized strength of 110 officers and men, and served for 18 months at the headquarters of Generals Don Carlos Buell and William S. Rosecrans, commanders of the Department and Army of the Ohio and Cumberland. The unit was frequently referred to as \\"Anderson Troop, Pennsylvania Cavalry\\", and while occasionally identified as the 15th Pennsylvania Cavalry because its officers raised and organized that regiment, it was never a part. Service The Anderson Troop was organized at Carlisle, Pennsylvania in October-November 1861 and mustered in on November 30, 1861 under the command of Captain William Jackson Palmer of Philadelphia, its organizer. The company was raised for headquarters and escort duty with Gen. Robert Anderson in Kentucky but instead became a unit of \\"elite scouts.\\" Palmer, a Quaker, recruited a number of men of his faith to serve in the company, and all members were hand-picked after nomination by upstanding citizens of Pennsylvania. Among the requirements for enrollment was an oath to abstain from consumption of liquor for the duration. In July 1862 Captain Palmer, 1st Lt. William Spencer, and 12 men were detailed to raise three additional companies of similar recruits to form a battalion to be known as the 1st Anderson Cavalry, with the Anderson Troop as its Company A. The recruiters, however, received sufficient applications to raise an entire regiment, which was authorized and became the 15th Pennsylvania Volunteer Cavalry. Palmer left the troop to become colonel of the 15th and Spencer the lieutenant colonel. Although known as the \\"Anderson Cavalry,\\" the regiment nonetheless did not incorporate the company into its ranks when it elected to remain independent under the command of its second lieutenant, Thomas Maple. 11 of its 17 officers and non-commissioned officers, with 21 of 90 privates, had joined the 15th, the majority of them commissioned as officers. With the 15th Pennsylvania Cavalry designated to become his headquarters cavalry, General William Rosecrans felt that the two units could not serve side-by-side without friction and offered the remaining 53 men of the Anderson Troop the opportunity to muster out of service, which was done on March 24, 1863.

He also published a popular book L'Univers et la Lumi√®re, Flammarion, Nouvelle Biblioth√®que Scientifique 1994, Champs 1998) for which he received a prize in 1995 (Prix du livre d'Astronomie Haute-Maurienne-Vanoise). According to Vincent Bontems and there are two distinct phases in Nottale's scientific career. From 1975 to 1991 this included conventional topics, such as gravitational lenses, while from 1984 onwards he focused on developing his theory of scale relativity, a proposal for a theory of physics based on fractal space-time. Nottale and Scale Relativity theory Scale relativity claims to extend the concept of relativity to physical scales (of time, length, energy, or momentum). Proponents have made wide-ranging claims on its behalf, including applications to the existence of dark matter and the formation of planetary systems, as well as to biology, geology, and the technological singularity. Nottale, himself, did not study technological singularties. However, the proposal has not attracted wide acceptance by the scientific community.

It was the largest political protest in the Second Polish Republic, taking place in 12 voivodeships of the Second Polish Republic. It is estimated that several million peasants took part in the demonstrations, and the strike was supported not only by Polish peasants, but also by the Ukrainian and Belarusian farmers, who made a majority in eastern part of the Second Polish Republic. Background By mid-1930s, Poland, a country with a large agricultural sector, was significantly affected by the Great Depression, Janusz Gmitruk, Rok 1937, Realia, Kwiecie≈Ñ NR 2 (11) 2009 with peasants being one of the most affected groups. Polish peasantry, especially in overpopulated areas of Lesser Poland, was desperately poor. Prices of food products fell down, which resulted in smaller profits for the peasants. In some provinces, the countryside went backwards to the 19th century, with imminent prospect of hunger. Unemployment among youth in villages was widespread, and this grew radicalization and frustration of the impoverished people. Furthermore, the increasingly more authoritarian government (sanacja) was losing public support. Immediately after the May Coup, some leaders of peasant parties hoped that cooperation with the new government was possible. However, further events, such as destruction of Centrolew, arrest of Wincenty Witos, and the ill-fated 1930 election deeply disappointed all of them. In response to the actions of the government, in 1931 a new political party of the peasants, agrarian People's Party (Stronnictwo Ludowe, SL) was created out of three smaller parties. SL leaders, who by mid-1930s became more radical, emphasized quantity of numerous Polish peasantry and its physical strength. They claimed that peasants were real hosts of the country. In an attempt to wrest political power, the SL was organizing a series of large demonstrations and strikes; those were often met with government opposition; over the years violent incidents occurred, leading to fatalities. Peasants' protests were frequent, and in all cases they were brutally suppressed by the sanacja regime. Among most notable events of this kind was a large wave of strikes, which took place in 1932-33 in southern Poland, in the area of Lapanow, Lesko, and Ropczyce. Instead of negotiating, the government would send armed police or units of the Polish Army, which pacified villages and sometimes killed the demonstrators. It has been estimated that across 1930s, around 100 peasants were killed by the security forces. The idea of the strike did not meet with unanimous approval. Marginal Communist Party of Poland (Komunistyczna Partia Polski, KPP) threw its weight behind the strike, but right wing National Party (Stronnictwo Narodowe, SN) was opposed to it. Crucially, Polish Socialist Party (Polska Partia Socjalistyczna, PPS) declined to participate in it, so despite KPP support, the strike did not spread to the cities, as SL hoped. Notheless some worker strikes did occur during that period. Even within SL not all activists were convinced it was a good idea; it was supported by Wincenty Witos and Stanis≈Çaw Miko≈Çajczyk, but criticized by Maciej Rataj. The decision to start the strike was the effect of new tactics, worked out during the Extraordinary Congress of the People's Party (SL), which took place on January 17, 1937, in Warsaw. On that day it was decided that if the government did not meet demands of the SL, a general peasant strike would be introduced. Participants in the Congress signed an appeal which demanded democratization of the country, amnesty for politicians sentenced in the Brest trials, and changes in the Constitution. The strike was prepared by Stanis≈Çaw Miko≈Çajczyk, also by Wincenty Witos, who had been forced to leave Poland and lived in Czechoslovakia. Using his couriers, Witos sent advice and instructions. Prelude to the strike took place on April 18, 1937, when peasants organized a large demonstration in the fields of Raclawice, site of a 1792 battle (see Battle of Raclawice), in which Polish units consisted of several peasant soldiers. On that day, thousands of people gathered, unaware of the fact that Minister Felicjan Slawoj-Skladkowski had forbidden public demonstrations and meetings. The rally was attacked by the police, which killed 3 peasants. The strike August 15 was the Holiday of Peasant Activity (≈öwiƒôto Czynu Ch≈Çopskiego)., a holiday introduced to honor participation of Polish peasants in the Polish-Soviet War. On that day, numerous rallies took place, during which a 10-day nationwide peasant strike was announced. These rallies were carefully organized, as they were supposed to show the power of peasant movement of Poland. One of the biggest events of this kind took place on the market square in Kolbuszowa. Those present marched with green flags of Polish peasants. During speeches, people were urged to start open struggle until full victory, like back in 1920. Peasants were told that the Miracle at the Vistula was not a miracle, but victory of peasant soldiers. Chants such as \\"Down with the sanacja government\\" were heard, also calls for release of political prisoners. Participants in the strike pledged not to send food to towns and cities, and also block roads. Timing was crucial, as in mid-August, old food supplies in the cities had been exhausted, and deliveries of new goods were expected to cover shortages. SL activists, who created Peasant Order Guard (Chlopska Straz Porzadkowa) watched the roads, urging all peasants not to weasel out of the strike. The biggest August 15 rallies took place in Jaros≈Çaw, Grebow, Dƒôbica, Przeworsk, Bochnia, and Ciezkowice. The strike begun on August 16, 1937, and lasted (as planned) till August 25. SL leaders kept the date of the beginning of the strike as top secret. In his memoirs, an SL activist from Bochnia wrote: \\"Everything was carefully prepared. Members of Krak√≥w's district of the party came to our village, instructing us what to do and how to act in case of trouble. We were told to light bonfires on August 14, as a sign that a large meeting of peasants was approaching\\". Rallies were organized not only in villages and towns, but also in cities. In Krak√≥w, on Sunday, August 15, thousands of peasants with banners and orchestras gathered in the Jablonowski Square. A peasant from Bienczyce, Jakub Pszczola, gave a speech, in which he announced that the strike would begin on the next day. After his speech, leaflets were spread among those gathered, and peasants began singing their informal anthem \\"Gdy nar√≥d do boju\\" (\\"When The Nation Fights\\"). The leaflets informed about demands of the strikers, such as dissolution of the Parliament, release of political prisoners, change of the Constitution, and just distribution of social goods. Even though SL leadership hoped that the action would cover whole country except for border and ethnically mixed areas, in reality it was successful only in southern part of historical province of Lesser Poland (Ma≈Çopolska) region, with major events taking place in eastern counties of the Krak√≥w Voivodeship, and western counties of the Lw√≥w Voivodeship, particularly in the Jaros≈Çaw County, where the SL structures were the strongest. Peasant demonstrators blockaded roads and stopped food transports to the cities, and at first, the government tolerated the action, regarding it as legal, and convinced that the SL would not be able to expand the protest. Also, as Felicjan Slawoj-Skladkowski stated later, SL leadership had assured that the strike would be of peaceful character. Therefore, Skladkowski had left for a two-week vacation in France, leaving Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski in charge. This indicated that the government, even though aware of the strike, did not plan to use force. One of peasant activists from the area of Sandomierz wrote later: \\"In every village there was a strike committee, with deputies in case of arrests. There were self-reliance organizations, which collected food and money for those incarcerated. Also, families of arrested activists were offered help during the harvest time\\". After a few days, however, this stance was changed and terror was introduced. The change was also spurred by the actions of the peasants themselves, who had become more radical. SL activists created groups of 4 - 10 mostly young men, who were armed with sticks, and watched all roads. They did not hesitate to use force against the strikebreaker, beating them, killing their horses, destroying produce, and overturning their wagons. In some cases, radical activists attacked houses of the strikebreakers. In the course of the time, the strike turned into an uprising, which was noticed by activists of the Polish Communist Party, who appeared in the area, with their propaganda (in their appeal to the nation, the communist stated \\"Let the cities and villages die! Long live the nationwide strike! They will not arrest millions\\"). First skirmishes took place in the area of Jaros≈Çaw on August 17, where members of the Peasants' Order Guard fought the police. On the same day, in Grebow near Tarnobrzeg, first peasant was killed. In response, the peasants blocked the main road of southern Poland, route Krak√≥w - Lw√≥w (in the area of Brzesko), where transport of all goods was halted. Local police commandant wrote in his report: \\"On the roads and in their vicinity there are gangs of peasants armed with knives, sticks, perhaps guns. We are defenseless against them. Today, they have formed a march of around 500, which started from Wielka Wies. On the way, more people joined them. Economy in our area has been completely paralyzed. We are requesting help and awaiting orders\\". General Marian Kukiel wrote to Wladyslaw Sikorski: \\"The police are completely exhausted. There are losses. There are no police units in Krak√≥w. If the communists were a significant force, they would be taking advantage of this situation\\". Actions of the police were described as cruel and barbarian. Officers beat peasants, their wives and children with batons, rallies were dispersed, and during revisions in houses, furniture and goods were destroyed. The police, of whom 108 were wounded, never tried to negotiate, instead, they used not only batons, but also guns, firing at the crowds without warning. Approximately 5,000 peasants were detained, 617 arrested, and in some cases, violence on both sides lead to fatalities (44 peasant demonstrators were killed during the strike, 15 of them coming from the village of Majdan Sieniawski, in Przeworsk county). Among counties with most people arrested, there were: * Jaros≈Çaw County - 61 arrested, * Brzoz√≥w County - 47 arrested, * Rzesz√≥w County - 16 arrested, * Przemy≈õl County - 16 arrested. About 700 farms were pacified, as the police used the doctrine of collective responsibility. The number of wounded is difficult to estimate, as in many situations, the peasants did not go to hospitals, fearing arrest. Nevertheless, despite the repressions, the peasants showed their strength, determination and organizational abilities. SL leaders deliberately chose not to organize the strike in the border areas of the country - Pomerania, Upper Silesia, Volhynia, and the areas of Tarnopol and Wilno, as deterioration of social situation in those strategic and vulnerable provinces, inhabited by ethnic minorities, was unwanted by them. Also, since SL structures in Mazovia, Podlasie, Greater Poland, and northern Lesser Poland (areas of Kielce, Lublin, and Radom) were not as strong as those in the south, the strike there was of a limited character and did not evolve into a mass protest. Outcome Since the mutual violence of the peasants and the police, among whom there were units of freshly created riot police, was getting out of hand, on August 20 SL leadership decided to stop the strike. The police, which at first was shocked at the magnitude of the protest, took their revenge, pacifying villages and beating participants. This in return provoked hatred of the villagers. First processes of the arrested peasants began in December 1937 in the court in Przemy≈õl. Altogether, around 1000 people were sentenced to up to 5 years. Many of them stayed behind bars until September 1939, when prison guards left their posts behind, escaping the advancing German troops. The strike failed to shift the official balance of power, as sanacja remained in control. However, it strengthened the Polish peasant movement, and was seen by the peasant activist as a successful demonstration of force. SL activists wanted to organize another strike in 1938, but due to deteriorating international situation, and growing threat of German aggression, it was called off. During World War II, those who took part in the 1937 strike, organized Polish Peasants' Battalions, and after the war, they opposed introduction of the Communist system.

It is bounded by Laramide uplifts on all sides. On the west is the Wind River Range and on the North are the Absaroka Range and the Owl Creek Mountains. The Casper Arch separates the Wind River from the Powder River Basin to the east and the Sweetwater Uplift (Granite Range) lies to the south. The basin contains a sequence of 10,000‚Äì12,000 feet (3000‚Äì3700 meters) of predominantly marine sediments deposited during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic Eras. During the Laramide over 18,000 feet (5500 meters) of Eocene lacustrine and fluvial sediments were deposited within the basin. Following the Eocene an additional 3,000 feet (900 meters) of sediments were deposited before, and as the basin was uplifted in the late Tertiary. The geological formations within the basin are significant producers of petroleum and natural gas. The basin contains over 60 oil and gas fields mostly as structural traps within seventeen different formations. The primary reservoirs include the Pennsylvanian Tensleep Sandstone, the Permian Phosphoria Formation and the Cretaceous Muddy Creek and Frontier sandstones. The first oil strike within the basin was from the Dallas dome in the western part of the basin. This discovery in 1884 was the first commercial production in Wyoming. Major towns in the Wind River Basin include Riverton, Shoshoni, and Lander. Much of the Wind River Basin is within the boundaries of the Wind River Indian Reservation. The basin is drained primarily by the Wind River and its tributaries.

Its chief purpose is to facilitate the views of a branch of New York State public schools that adhere to the guidelines established by legislative special acts that created them to meet the unique needs of students falling under Title I D (neglected and delinquent minors) of NCLB and offer a full or partial residential placement while providing the educational needs of this struggling population. Many of the residents from these communities are assigned to these districts through the court system, committees on special education referrals and social service placements from nearby orphanages and group homes.  Terminology  These districts are not considered charter schools but instead, completely state- funded public school districts. In addition, they are not the same as Private or State-Run schools. Each of the Special Act School Districts has its own Board of Education which convenes to regulate district policy and procedures. New York State Special Act school districts There were originally 20 districts in all. Recent changes in state funding and budgetary reform have resulted in only ten special act school districts left to handle the needs of all special act student populations within New York State. They are as follows. * Randolph Academy Union Free School District * Berkshire Union Free School District * Little Flower Union Free School District * George Junior Republic Union Free School District * Greenburgh-Graham Union Free School District * Greenburgh Eleven Union Free School District * Greenburgh-North Castle Union Free School District * Hawthorne-Cedar Knolls Union Free School District * Mount Pleasant-Cottage Union Free School District * Mount Pleasant- Blythdale Union Free School District More than a few of the New York State Special Act Schools have closed since the 1980's. The Wiltwyk School(closed) was attended by Claude Brown, author of the 1965 best seller 'Manchild in the Promised land' which chronicled his time at the school. He credits The Wiltwyk school, overseen by the psychologist Ernst Papanek for his turnaround from juvenile delinquent to serious student and eventual work as mentor to young people in Newark. The Special Act school districts generally have a small student to teacher ratio and counseling available to students. Sadly many of these districts are closing and funding for the districts is limited.

The group is stationed at Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico. During World War II, its predecessor unit, the 27th Bombardment (later Fighter) Group fought in the Pacific Ocean and Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres. Its ground personnel fought as infantry in the 1941‚Äì1942 Battle of Bataan with the survivors being forced to march as prisoners in the Bataan Death March. Its air echelon went on to be awarded five Distinguished Unit Citations and a Philippine Presidential Unit Citation. The Airmen of the 27th were among the most decorated USAAF units of the war. Overview The 27th Special Operations Group accomplishes global special operations taskings as an Air Force component member of the United States Special Operations Command. It conducts infiltration/exfiltration, combat support, helicopter and tilt-rotor aerial refueling, psychological warfare, and other special missions. It directs the deployment, employment, training, and planning for squadrons that operate the AC-130W, MC-130J, CV-22B, U-28A and MQ-9, and provides operational support to flying operations. Components There are 9 squadrons within the group: : 27th Special Operations Support Squadron (27 SOSS) ‚Äì provides operational support to flight operations : 3d Special Operations Squadron (3 SOS) ‚Äì MQ-9 Reaper : 9th Special Operations Squadron (9 SOS) ‚Äì MC-130J Commando II : 12th Special Operations Squadron, provides remotely piloted aircraft launch and recovery operations : 16th Special Operations Squadron (16 SOS) ‚Äì AC-130W Stinger II : 20th Special Operations Squadron (20 SOS) ‚Äì CV-22 Osprey : 33d Special Operations Squadron (33 SOS) ‚Äì MQ-9 Reaper : 56th Special Operations Intelligence Squadron ‚Äì provides specialized intelligence support : 318th Special Operations Squadron (318 SOS) ‚Äì U-28A 27th Special Operations Group at Cannon AFB History (See also 27th Special Operations Wing for additional history and lineage information) On 1 February 1940, the United States Army Air Corps activated the 27th Bombardment Group (Light) at Barksdale Field (AAF), Louisiana and equipped it with the Douglas B-18 Bolo Light bomber aircraft. The group consisted of the 15th, 16th and 17th Bombardment Squadrons. In October 1941 the group moved to Hunter Army Airfield, Georgia, less the 15th Bombardment Squadron, which was reassigned to V Air Support Command on 14 October. On 21 October 1941 the group was ordered to the Philippine Islands in response to the growing crisis in the Pacific. =World War II=South West Pacific Theater=Philippine Campaign (1941‚Äì1942)= Arriving at Fort William McKinley in the Philippines on 20 November, the 27th BG (L) readied itself for delivery of its A-24 Dauntless aircraft. Concern grew as days turned into weeks and still the planes had not arrived. When the Imperial Japanese Army attacked the Philippines on 9 December 1941, the situation had not changed. Unknown to the 27th BG (L) Airmen, to avoid capture or destruction, the ship carrying the planes was diverted to Australia when the war escalated. On 18 December Major John H. Davies, 27th BG (L) commander, and an aircrew of 20 flew from Clark Field on Luzon in two B-18s and one Douglas C-39 of Transport Command to Tarakan Island in the Dutch East Indies to Darwin Australia arriving on 22 December. Flying from Darwin, the group arrived in Brisbane on 24 December to pick up their A-24s off the ship USAT Meigs. However, as a swift Japanese advance prevented his group from returning to the Philippines, the air echelon of the 27th was ordered to operate from Brisbane. The ground echelon of the 27th still in the Philippines was evacuated south from Luzon on 25 December to the Bataan Peninsula, arriving to form the 2nd Battalion (27th Bombardment Group) Provisional Infantry Regiment (Air Corp). For the 99 days following the attack on Pearl Harbor until their surrender to the Japanese after the Battle of Bataan, the men of the 27th BG became the only Air Force unit in history to fight as an infantry regiment, and were the only unit to be taken captive in whole. After surrendering, they were forced to endure the infamous Bataan Death March. Of the 880 or so Airmen who were taken, less than half survived captivity. However, a number of officers and enlisted men of the 27th Bomb Group were evacuated out of the Philippines in five U.S. Navy submarines just before it was overrun by the Japanese during April. , , , and , on the night of 3 May 1942 managed to sneak into Manila Bay and evacuate American personnel from Corregidor to Java and Fremantle, Western Australia. =Dutch East Indies and New Guinea Campaigns (1942)= Unidentified 1941 serial Douglas A-24-DE Dauntless Dive Bomber, ex 27th Bombardment Group (Light), reassigned to the 8th Squadron of the 3rd Bomb Group, Charters Towers Airfield, Queensland, Australia, 1942. In Australia, the escaped airmen and aircraft of the 27th Bomb Group reformed into a combat unit. In early 12 February pilots of the 91st Sqdn flew their A-24's with gunners from Brisbane to Malang Java in the colonial Dutch East Indies to defend the island. The group participated in an attack on the Japanese invasion fleet landing troops on Bali. The attacks, carried out during the afternoon of 19 February and throughout the morning of 20 February, caused little damage and all air operations that day failed to halt the landings. The group was credited with the sinking of a Japanese cruiser and a destroyer. From 27 February through 1 March, three A-24's of the 91st Sqdn participated in Battle of the Java Sea. The remaining pilots and gunners of the 27th Bomb Group were flown out to Australia in early March, consolidating with the 16th and 17th Squadrons which had moved from Brisbane to Batchelor Airfield in the Northern Territory. For their heroic efforts in the Philippines and the Southwest Pacific during late 1941 and early 1942, the 27th Bombardment Group (Light) received three Distinguished Unit Citations (DUC). On 25 March, Davies and the surviving 27th Bomb Group personnel, consisting of 42 officers, 62 enlisted men and 24 A-24s, were reassigned on mass to the four squadrons of the 3d Bombardment Group at Charters Towers Airfield in Queensland, Australia. The remaining A-24 aircraft were added to the 8th Bombardment Squadron. On 4 May, the 27th Bomb Group was officially inactivated. (Davies was appointed CO of the 3rd BG, and senior pilots from the 27th BG became commanders of the 8th, 13th and 90th Squadrons respectively. Over the next 21 months they flew combat missions over the Philippines, New Guinea and Rabaul. Among many other operations, the 3rd BG played a leading role at the Battle of the Bismarck Sea.) European- African-Middle Eastern Theater=North African Campaign= On 4 May the was reactivated without personnel or equipment at Hunter AAF Georgia. At Hunter, the group was re-manned and re-equipped with the Douglas A-20 Havoc light bomber. After additional training in Mississippi and Louisiana, on 26 December the group was transferred to Ste-Barbe-du-Tlelat Airfield, Algeria to enter combat in North Africa with Twelfth Air Force. Maintenance and support personnel went by sea to North Africa while aircrews and the A-20s flew to South America then across to North Africa, In North Africa, the A-20s were sent to other groups and the 27th Bomb Group was redesignated as the 27th Fighter-Bomber Group and reequipped with the North American A-36 Invader dive bomber. Assigned to Korba, Tunisia, the 27th FBG flew its first combat missions of the war on 6 June 1943. The 27th served in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO) until the end of the war. It was redesignated the 27th Fighter Group in May 1944 when the group converted first to the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, then to the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt aircraft. =Sicilian/Italian Campaigns= During the Sicilian Campaign, operations included participation in the reduction of Pantelleria and Lampedusa Islands and supporting ground forces during the conquest of Sicily. In the Italian Campaign the 27th covered the landings at Salerno and received a Distinguished Unit Citation (DUC) for preventing three German armored divisions from reaching the Salerno beachhead on 10 September 1943. In addition, the group supported the Fifth Army during the Allied drive toward Rome. =Southern France= The group took part in the invasion of Southern France and assisted Seventh Army's advance up the Rh√¥ne Valley, receiving a second DUC for helping to disrupt the German retreat, 4 September 1944. The 27th took part in the interdiction of the enemy's communications in northern Italy, and assisted in the Allied drive from France into Germany during the last months of the war, eventually being stationed at Biblis, Germany on V-E Day. With five Distinguished Unit Citations and a Philippine Presidential Unit Citation, the Airmen of the 27th were among the most decorated USAAF units of World War II. Cold War=Postwar era= 27th FW North American F-82E Twin Mustangs, (Serial 46-354 identifiable) along with a Boeing B-29 Superfortress at Kearney AFB Nebraska. 27th Fighter-Escort Group F-84Gs, Bergstrom AFB, Texas, 1952 In the immediate postwar drawdown of the USAAF, the 27th Fighter Group was returned to the United States in October 1945, then inactivated on 7 November at Camp Shanks, New York. Within a year, the group was reactivated in Germany on 20 August 1946, being assigned to Fritzlar Air Base, flying P-47 Thunderbolts. The group stayed in Germany for a year performing occupation duty until being transferred, without personnel or equipment, to Andrews AAF, Maryland, in June 1947. The 27th was assigned to Strategic Air Command and reactivated at Kearney AAF Nebraska. Fighter Squadrons of the 27th were the 522d, 523d and 524th. The 27th was initially equipped with the North American P-51D Mustang, and in 1948 was upgraded to the new North American F-82E Twin Mustang. In June 1948 the designation \\"P\\" for pursuit was changed to \\"F\\" for fighter. Subsequently, all P-51s were redesignated F-51s. The mission of the 27th Fighter Wing was to fly long-range escort missions for SAC Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers. With the arrival of the F-82s, the older F-51s were sent to Air National Guard units. The first production F-82Es reached the 27th in early 1948, and almost immediately the group was deployed to McChord AFB, Washington, in June where its squadrons stood on alert on a secondary air defense mission due to heightened tensions over the Berlin Airlift. It was also believed that the 27th would launch an escort mission, presumably to the Soviet Union, if conflict broke out in Europe. From McChord, the group flew its Twin Mustangs on weather reconnaissance missions over the northwest Pacific, but problems were encountered with their fuel tanks. Decommissioned F-61 Black Widow external tanks were found at Hamilton AFB, California that could be modified for the F-82 which were fitted on the pylons of the Twin Mustang that solved the problem. With a reduction in tensions, the 27th returned to its home base in Nebraska during September where the unit settled down to transition flying with their aircraft.Pape 1977, pp. 48‚Äì63. On 1 August 1948 the 27th Fighter Wing was activated. Although established over a year earlier in July 1947. Under the Hobson Plan the 27th FW commanded the functions of both the support groups as well as the flying combat 27th Fighter Group and the squadrons assigned to it. Four F-82s were deployed to Alaska from McChord where the pilots provided transition training to the 449th Fighter (All Weather) Squadron which used Twin Mustangs in the air defense mission. They remained in Alaska for about 45 days, returning to rejoin the rest of the group at the beginning of November 1948. In January 1949, Eighth Air Force planned a large celebration at Carswell AFB. All of its assigned units were to participate in a coordinated flyover. Most of SAC's bombers were to participate, along with SAC's only \\"Long Range\\" fighter group, the 27th. The weather in Nebraska in January that year was especially horrible, with most airports in the Midwest weathered in the day of the display. At Kearney AFB, the base was socked-in with a blizzard. Nevertheless, the crews had an early morning mission briefing, the aircraft in the hangars were preflighted and prepared for the flyover mission. Paths were cut through the snow for the aircraft to taxi and somehow the F-82s got airborne, with the 27th's Twin Mustangs joining up with SAC bombers over Oklahoma on schedule. The flyover by the Twin Mustangs was a tremendous success, with SAC leadership being amazed that the F-82 was truly an \\"all weather\\" aircraft and the 27th being able to carry out their mission despite the weather. In early 1949, the 27th began carrying out long-range escort profile missions. Flights to Puerto Rico, Mexico, the Bahamas and nonstop to Washington D.C were carried out. For President Truman's 1949 inauguration, the 27th FEW launched 48 aircraft to fly in review, along with several other fighter units, in formation down Pennsylvania Avenue. Another flyover over the newly -dedicated Idlewild Airport in New York City soon followed, with the aircraft flying non-stop from Kearney AFB. With the tight defense budgets in the late 1940s, the decision was made by Strategic Air Command decided to close Kearney AFB in 1949. The 27th was transferred to Bergstrom AFB Texas on 16 March. At Bergstrom, the 27th transitioned to jet aircraft with Republic Aviation F-84E Thunderjet in 1950. It was redesignated the 27th Fighter-Escort Group, to better represent the mission of the group on 1 February. By the end of summer, the transition to the Tunderjets was complete and the Twin Mustangs were mostly sent to reclamation, with a few being sent to Far East Air Forces or Alaska as replacement aircraft or for air defense duties. The wing won the Mackay Trophy for successful deployment of 180 F-84s from Bergstrom AFB, to F√ºrstenfeldbruck Air Base West Germany, in September 1950, via Labrador, Greenland, Iceland, and England, delivering the Thunderjets to the 36th Fighter-Bomber Group. This was the Second (the first being the 20th FG flying 64 F-84Ds on 20 July 1950 during Operation \\"READY\\" from Shaw AB, SC to RAF Manston, UK) long-range mass flight of jet aircraft in aviation history. After the pilots and support ground personnel were flown back to Bergstrom on MATS transports, a new production batch of F-84Es were picked up, and on 15 October the group headed for Neubiberg Air Base, West Germany, this time with ninety-two aircraft. =Korean War= Republic F-84E-15-RE Thunderjet 49-2360, 27th FEW, Taegu AB (K-2), South Korea, 1951 Dec 1950: F-84G Thunderjets of the 27th Fighter Escort Wing arrive at a Japan Air Defense Force base in northern Japan after completing a trans-Pacific flight. Upon their return to Bergstrom in November 1950, the 27th anticipated another delivery trip to Europe and a permanent change of station to USAFE. However, this was changed to a deployment to Japan and duty in the Korean War. The 27th departed Bergstrom on 11 November with the 522d FES refueling en route at Biggs AFB, Texas; the 523d FES at Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, and the 524th FES at Williams AFB, Arizona on the way to San Diego, California. The overseas transport of the 27th was via the USS Bairoko on 14 November and the USS Bataan on 16 November. The USS Cape Esperance, with the remainder of the wing was scheduled to depart from San Francisco on 27 November, but this was delayed for two days while fifty F-86A Sabres and their equipment for the 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing were loaded for their transfer to Japan. By 30 November the ground echelon had arrived at Kimpo Air Base (K-14), South Korea, preparing for the arrival of the air echelon which had been unloaded in Japan. Once unloaded from the transport carriers, the aircraft were barged to Kisarazu Air Base where they were preflighted for a short flight to Yokota Air Base. However the aircraft were damaged during their trans-Pacific open-air deck shipment and had salt air induced corrosion; corroded electrical equipment and landing gear damage. Some of the aircraft also had flat tires. On 1 December Far East Air Forces decided they would station their short-ranged 4th FIG at Kimpo (K-14) and the 27th was ordered split into forward and rear echelons. Advanced headquarters would be at Taegu Air Base (K-2), South Korea; while the rear echelon would locate at Itazuke Air Base, Japan. The advanced echelon would be attached to the F-80 Shooting Star equipped 49th Fighter-Bomber Wing at Tageu for logistical support, while the rear portion would be attached to the provisional 6160th Air Base Wing at Itazuke for the same kind of support. The first six of rapidly repaired F-84Es arrived at K-2 on 5 December. All of these aircraft were equipped with special gun camera that were depressed to record bomb strikes. They were also JATO- Equipped with a special electronic system for their operation. The 27th flew their first combat mission on 6 December 1950; the mission being an \\"armed reconnaissance\\" over the Chinnampo River area. Over the next two days, thirty- two rockets and 7,200 rounds of .50 caliber ammunition were expended. Several locomotives were claimed as damaged and a North Korean village was strafed. On 13 December two 27th FEG Thunderjets were lost on a strafing mission two miles west of Krin-ni when the aircraft did not return and crashed to the ground. One aircraft crashed on the ground; the cause not known; another was given a go-around at K-2 because of other traffic. The aircraft suddenly lost power and made a belly landing in a dry creek bed; the Thunderjet written-off as a result. By January, the remainder of the 27th's aircraft were made operational. For the next six months, the 27th flew missions in support of ground forces, earning another DUC for missions between 26 January and 21 April 1951. Among these missions was close support of the largest paratroop landing in the Korean War and escort for Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers on raids over North Korea, including air-to-air combat with enemy MiG-15 fighters. In June the was given the responsibility for acclimating the newly arrived 136th Fighter-Bomber Wing to combat, as the 136th was their replacement. They were also given the responsibility of assisting the 49th Fighter-Bomber Wing in transition from F-80Cs to F-84Es. In eight months of combat, the 27th had participated in three major campaigns and earned the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation. They had flown 12,000 combat missions and had lost seven of their pilots in combat, and fifteen F-84 aircraft to all causes. The 27th was relieved from assignment to FEAF in July 1951 and returned to Bergstrom AFB. On 3 August the was declared non- operational when its squadrons were attached for operational control to the 27th FEW as part of the Air Force tri-deputate reorganization. Inactivated on 16 June 1952 when the group was considered redundant. Modern era General Dynamics EF-111A AF Serial No. 67-0035 of the 429th/430th Electronic Combat Squadron. Aircraft sent to AMARC on 28 April 1998. General Dynamics Block 40B F-16C of the 524th Fighter Squadron, AF Serial No. 88-0416. This was the first F-16 delivered to the 524th FS. The group was reactivated in on 1 November 1991 as the 27th Operations Group and assigned to the 27th Fighter Wing as part of the \\"Objective Wing\\" concept adapted by the Air Force. The 27th OG was bestowed the lineage, honors and history of its predecessor history and honors of the 27 Tactical Fighter Group and its predecessor units. The 27 OG took control of the wings fighter squadrons upon activation. From September 1992 to July 1993, 27 OG F-111 aircrews and support personnel rotated to Incirlik Air Base, Turkey, in support of Operation PROVIDE COMFORT. In 1995 the face of the flightline changed when the wing began its transition to General Dynamics F-16C/D aircraft. The first F-16s to arrive in May were assigned to the 522d Fighter Squadron. Also transitioning were the 523d and 524th Fighter Squadrons. With the arrival of the F-16s, the F-111s were sent to AMARC. The 428th Fighter Squadron was inactivated in September 1995, and the ECW EF-111A-equipped 429 ECS was inactivated in May 1998 with the 27th Operations Group officially holding a retirement ceremony in memorial park. The F-111 in various forms had been at Cannon AFB for 29 years. With their retirement, the 430 ECS was inactivated. On 15 January 1998, the 524th Fighter Squadron ventured to the desert for their first overseas deployment since transitioning to the F-16. The 522d Fighter Squadron deployed to Prince Sultan Air Base, Saudi Arabia in direct support of Operation SOUTHERN WATCH. They flew missions enforcing UN resolutions of no-fly zone over Southern Iraq. In March, the 523d Fighter Squadron also deployed to Southwest Asia in support of Operation SOUTHERN WATCH. These two 27 FW squadrons were the first F-16 unit to replace Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II units performing close air support. In addition, they were the first F-16 unit to maintain the demanding combat search and rescue alert in Southwest Asia. While deployed to the Gulf region in December 1998, the F-16s from the 522d Fighter Squadron provided close air support alert, defensive counter air alert and interdiction in Iraq. In August 1998, the 524th Fighter Squadron deployed to Hill AFB, Utah for exercise Combat Hammer. During the exercise, they dropped inert GBU-24 Paveway III laser-guided bombs and fired live AGM-65 Maverick antitank missiles on Utah test range. The hit rate was one of the highest ever seen in the Air Force, showcasing the lethality of the Block 40 F-16. In 1998, the governments of the United States and Singapore signed an agreement laying the foundation of the Peace Carvin III program. As a Foreign Military Sales training program for the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF), Peace Carvin III was designed for the continued training of RSAF in rapid deployment and tactical employment of the block 52 F-16C/D throughout a wide spectrum of missions including air-to-air, joint maritime and precision air-to-ground weapons delivery. In support of Peace Carvin III, the 428th Fighter Squadron was reactivated on 12 November 1998 and tasked to take the lead in Peace Carvin III. The squadron was a hybrid of USAF and RSAF F-16C/D manned by USAF instructor pilots, Singaporean pilots and combined RSAF and USAF teams of maintenance and support personnel. In May 1999, the 428th Fighter Squadron participated in its first official major exercise after its reactivation. The squadron deployed to Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, for exercise Combat Archer. The exercise was designed to test weapons capabilities, tactics and employment. This included the first live firing of radar-guided air-to-air AIM-7 Sparrow by the RSAF. With the completion of Peace Carvin III, the 428 FS was inactivated on 6 July 2005. In July 1999, the 522d Fighter Squadron deployed to Keflavik Naval Air Station, Iceland, to support NATO exercise Coronet Norsemen. They served primarily as the combat air arm of the Iceland Defense Force. In August 1999, the 523d Fighter Squadron relieved the 522d Fighter Squadron from Coronet Norsemen. During Operation ALLIED FORCE in 1999, the 524th Fighter Squadron was notified for \\"on-call\\" duty to augment forces. Quick termination of hostilities precluded the 524th Fighter Squadron from seeing action. =Global War on Terror= On 11 September 2001 when terrorists attacked the World Trade Center in New York City and The Pentagon in Washington, D.C., aircraft from the 27 FW went on air defense alert. Two weeks following the 9/11 attacks members of the 27th Civil Engineer Squadron Prime BEEF team had deployed to a forward location in the AOR and built a tent city at a (then) Classified location. They would not return till March 2002. In December 2002, the 524 FS deployed to Kuwait and participated in Operation IRAQI FREEDOM, dropping nearly a million pounds of precision guided munitions, more than any other F-16 Block 40 squadron in history. In September 2007, the 522d Expeditionary Fighter Squadron wrapped up the final deployment for their squadron and, ultimately, the 27th Operations Group. The 522d Fighter Squadron, known as the Fireballs, were inactivated upon their return to Cannon AFB and the 27 FW became the 27th Special Operations Group on 1 October 2007. Among the units that joined the group were the 3d SOS (MQ-1), 73d SOS (MC-130W) and 318th SOS (light transport aircraft) as well as the 20th SOS (CV-22s). =Lineage= * Established as 27th Bombardment Group (Light) on 22 December 1939 : Activated on 1 February 1940 : Redesignated: 27th Fighter Bomber Group on 23 August 1943 : Redesignated: 27th Fighter Group on 30 May 1944 : Inactivated on 7 November 1945 * Activated on 20 August 1946 by redesignation of 366th Fighter Group : Redesignated 27th Fighter-Escort Group on 1 February 1950 : Inactivated on 16 June 1952 * Redesignated: 27th Tactical Fighter Group on 31 July 1985 (Remained inactive) * Redesignated: 27th Operations Group on 28 October 1991 : Activated on 1 November 1991 : Redesignated 27th Special Operations Group on 1 October 2007 The 27th Special Operations Group, located at Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico, is one of four groups assigned to the 27th Special Operations Wing. The group accomplishes global special operations taskings as an Air Force component member of the United States Special Operations Command. It conducts infiltration/exfiltration, combat support, tilt-rotor operations, helicopter aerial refueling, close air support, unmanned aerial vehicle operations, non-standard aviation, and other special missions. It directs the deployment, employment, training, and planning for squadrons that operate the AC-130W, MC-130J, CV-22B, C-146A, U-28A, MQ-1, MQ-9 and provides operational support to flying operations. Lineage The 27th SOG has a long and distinguished history since its inception as the 27th Bombardment Group at Barksdale Field, Louisiana, 1 February 1940. Elements of the 27 BG were in the Philippines when the Japanese invaded the island in December 1941, and aided in the fight against the invading force. The Japanese eventually overran the country, and as a result, many members of the 27 BG were taken prisoners of war and forced to participate in the Bataan Death March in 1942. Throughout the last 68 years, the 27th designation has been assigned to several groups and wings at a myriad of locations. The 27th was organized as a fighter wing in August 1947, at Kearney Airfield, Nebraska. Later, in February 1958, in a move to preserve the heritage of the 27th, Air Force leadership transferred the designation to Cannon, replacing the 312th Wing. Since 1958, the wing had supported F-100s, T/AT-33s, F-111s and F-16s. The 27th Operations Group was re-designated as the 27th SOG on 1 October 2007. =Assignments= * Southeast Air District (later, 3 Air Force), 1 February 1940 * 3d Air Support Command, 1 September 1941 * V Bomber Command, c. 20 November 1941 : Ground echelon attached to: V Interceptor Command, 24 December 1941 ‚Äì 8 May 1942 : Air echelon under operational control of American-British-Dutch-Australian Command, c.

He was a former member of the Comintern and the Balkan Communist Federation. He was associated with the Fan S. Noli government in 1924 and became the leader of the Bashkimi organization after the death of Avni Rustemi in 1924. In 1928 he helped establish the Kor√ß√´ Communist Group.Alexander, Robert J. International Trotskyism, 1929-1985: A Documented Analysis of the Movement. Durham and London: Duke University Press, 1991., p. 32. In the fierce rivalry for power control within the Communist Party, he was branded a Trotskyist and purged from the party.Enver Hoxha, Selected Works: Nov. 1941-Oct. 1948; Volume 1. \\"8 N√´ntori\\" Pub. House, 1974. Page 316 Biography Fundo was born in G√∂rice (now Kor√ß√´, Albania) to a family of merchants originating from Moscopole, of Vlach origin. He attended the French Lyc√©e of Salonica and later studied law in Paris, France. He was the mentor to other Albanian Communist students in Paris, including future Albanian leader Enver Hoxha, to whom he taught law.Hamm, Harry. Albania‚ÄîChina's Beachhead in Europe. New York: Frederick A. Praeger, Inc., 1963., p. 84, 93. =Return to Albania in 1924= Upon returning to Albania he was a member of Avni Rrustemi's Bashkimi organization which he later took over upon Rrustemi's death by assassination in April 1924. Fundo developed connections with Orthodox Bishop Fan S. Noli and played an active role in forcing then-Prime Minister Ahmet Zogu's exile to Yugoslavia that same year. Upon the overthrow of Noli's government in November 1924, Fundo emigrated to Vienna, Austria, becoming member of KONARE thus acquainted with the Balkan Communist Federation, and then emigrated to the Soviet Union where he became a member of the Comintern. =Organization of the Kor√ß√´ Albanian Communist Group = In 1929 he took part in the 8th Congress of the Balkan Communist Federation where he discussed the founding of a Communist Party in Albania, having helped establish the Albanian Communist Group in 1928 in Kor√ß√´.Alexander, Robert J. International Trotskyism, 1929-1985: A Documented Analysis of the Movement. Durham and London: Duke University Press, 1991., p. 32. From 1930-1931 he served as a journalist for the Vienna-based magazine The Balkan Federation. =1933-1939: anti-Stalinism and expulsion from Comintern= In 1933 while in Germany he was a partial observer of the Reichstag fire events and traveled with Leipzig Trial participant Georgi Dimitrov (whom he befriended) back to Moscow. During the Spanish Civil War he organized Albanian volunteers for the International Brigades. During these years Fundo began criticizing the pro-Stalin wing of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as \\"Stalinist\\", gravitating more towards the views of Leon Trotsky. During the Great Purge he was expelled from the Comintern in 1938 as a \\"bourgeois deviationist\\" and a death sentence was announced against him. However, the intercession of Georgi Dimitrov, then leader of the Comintern, resulted in this sentence being dropped.Hamm, 84. =Return to Albania in 1939= Following the Italian invasion of Albania in 1939, Fundo returned to Albania and served as a secondary school teacher in his hometown of Kor√ß√´ until his dismissal a year later, as he was a participant in the underground struggles against the Italians. By this time he had become disillusioned with communism and embraced social-democracy.Owen Pearson. Albania in the Twentieth Century: A History Vol. III. New York: St. Martin's Press. 2006. p. 396. He was subsequently arrested in 1941 and sent to the island of Ventotene. Fundo became acquainted with Altiero Spinelli and Sandro Pertini during this period, the latter urging Fundo to stay and fight with the Italian resistance. As the Fascist government began to fall in 1943 however, Fundo was able to return to Albania. =Death in 1944 by Albanian communists= In September 1944 he was captured in southern Yugoslavia, then allegedly handed over by Josip Broz Tito to the guerrillas of the Communist Party of Albania under Enver Hoxha. He was accused of Trotskyism and collaboration with British Intelligence.Premtaj, Sadik. \\"Stalinism and Communism in Albania.\\" Revolutionary History #3 (1990). He was then either lashed or beaten to death.The source for Fundo being lashed to death can be found in Borkenau, Franz. European Communism. New York: Harper & Brothers, 1953., p. 408. Hamm states that he was beaten to death (Albania‚ÄîChina's Beachhead in Europe, p. 93). Another source for him being beaten to death can be found in Horos, George H. Show Trials: Stalinist Purges in Eastern Europe, 1948-1954. New York: Praeger Publishers, 1987, p. 7. \\"In the summer of 1944, he was arrested by his comrades and beaten to death before the horrified eyes of the British military mission.\\" According to Enver Hoxha in his memoirs, however, he was found by the Albanian National Liberation Army in the company of a \\"gang of bandits\\" led by anti-communist partisan Kryeziu Brothers and a British officer, an account that has since been substantiated.‚ÄòEnverists‚Äô and ‚ÄòTitoists‚Äô - I \\"Llaz√´r Fundo was murdered in Kosova while participating in an anti-Stalinist and anti-fascist movement led by a powerful family of Kosovo Muslim notables, the Kryeziu brothers.

ABAD√Å-Capoeira was founded in 1988, and ever since, Camisa has been at the head of many important philanthropy and martial arts movements all over the world.ABAD√Å-Capoeira, New York.

History. Retrieved 27 July 2009. History Camisa's brother Edvaldo Carneiro da Silva, also known as Gr√£o-Mestre Camisa Roxa, was the inspiration behind Camisa beginning his training in the Brazilian martial art of Capoeira, by urging him to enroll in an academy under the tutelage of Mestre Bimba. After about a year, Camisa became an Aluno Formado, a graduated student of Mestre Bimba. In the early 1970s, Camisa accompanied his brother on a year-long tour of Brazil with the folkloric dance company Olodum Mar√©,Almeida (1986, p.56) which performed traditional arts including capoeira. At the end of the tour, instead of returning to his studies in Salvador, Camisa decided to remain in Rio de Janeiro to teach Capoeira. As stated by Matthias R√∂hrig Assun√ß√£o in Capoeira : A History of an Afro-Brazilian Martial Art: > A number of Bahian capoeiristas ended up moving to Rio in the 1970s, > attracted by the greater possiblilites the city seemed to offer for the > development of the art. Among them were Peito Pelado, Baianinho da > Massaranduba and Dentinho, who all influenced the way younger Cariocians > played capoeira. Caimsa Roxa's younger brother Jos√© Tadeu Cardoso (M. > Camisa, then still called Camisinha) arrived in 1972 and soon became a > leading figure in the Senzala group.Assun√ß√£o (2005, p.174)Senzala in this > context refers to a group of young capoeira practitioners from Rio in the > mid to late 1960s and early 1970s. From Assun√ß√£o (2005, p.173-4) He began to offer training in capoeira and slowly gained students. Camisa began to consider the need to design a formal structure for classes, to draw up a basic lesson plan, to create a place for studying and teaching, a place to debate techniques and discuss concepts. In addition, he felt the need to give a family-like structure to so many people who had left behind their cities and their friends and families and moved to Rio to dedicate themselves to capoeira. The latter was the main impetus for the creation of a new organization that would, in 1988, become ABAD√Å-Capoeira. Since the beginning of the 1980s, Mestre Camisa had been drawing on his experience in Mestre Bimba's Academy to develop his own style and build his school. His unique technique and methodology improved the martial aspect of capoeira, and established him as the leading capoeira master in the world. CEMB The Centro Educacional Mestre Bimba (CEMB), in English translated as \\"Mestre Bimba Educational Center\\", is: :a space idealized by Mestre Camisa and built in honor of Mestre Bimba who loved nature. The CEMB offers courses, training sessions, meetings, lectures, workshops, ecological hikes, climbing, horseback riding, soccer, local cultural demonstrations, experience with rural customs, opportunity for contact with animals, a taste of food cooked on a traditional wood-burning oven and lessons in environmental preservation. All these activities are adapted so Capoeira movements can be added to them. Following the philosophy that we should use what nature offers, a large training area was constructed, using sap√™ (a local thatch), eucalyptus and stones, where the activities take place. The CEMB is located in the interior of the State of Rio de Janeiro, in the city of Itabora√≠, and offers sleeping quarters for 60 people and a camping area that can handle 100 tents.H√≠rek, aktualit√°sok. \\"ABADA CAPOEIRA - CEMB\\".

He gave the authorization to open the street on 3 July 1779. Opened in 1780, the street extended from the rue Basse-du-Rempart located at the foot of the rampart (now Boulevard des Capucines) to rue Neuve-des-Mathurins through land acquired from the priests mathurins by Charles-Marin Delahaye, general-farmer. Further on the north, was the small street Thiroux opened in 1773 by President Thiroux of Arconvill√©. And the small rue Sainte-Croix opened further on the north in 1780 through marshes and fields. The Rue de Caumartin absorbed them on 5 May 1849. http://www.paris-pittoresque.com/rues/151.htm The French architect Aubert built 28 mansions in the area, including the n¬∞1 and n¬∞2, on each side of the street at the beginning and the junction with the Boulevard des Capucines. They were decorated with figures in half relief, small amours, medallions, and various ornaments. Both included an outside rotunda on the street. Notable places * At n¬∞1: Mansion Marin-Delahaye.

It produces attractive flowers and fall foliage, as well as fruits that are popular with some species of bird. Description Leathery deciduous leaves are simple and grow in opposite blades ranging from 0.5-3 inches in length and 1-1.5 inches in width. Petioles are \\"rusty hairy\\" with grooves and sometimes wings. Leaf margins are serrate. Autumn leaf colors are bronze to red. Twigs range in color from \\"reddish brown to gray\\"; young twigs are hairy, and get smoother with age. Bark is similar that of the flowering dogwood, ranging in color from \\"reddish brown to almost black\\" and forming \\"blocky plates on larger trunks\\". Viburnum rufidulum blooms in April to May with creamy white flowers that are bisexual, or perfect and similar to those of other Viburnum species, but with clusters as large as six inches wide. The fruits are purple or dark blue, glaucous, globose or ellipsoid drupes that mature in mid to late summer. The edible fruit has been said to taste like raisins and attract birds. It is similar to Viburnum prunifolium (blackhaw). Petioles of V. prunifolium do not have the rusty hairs that those of V. rufidulum do. Distribution The rusty blackhaw prefers dry habitats with elevations generally below 750 m. It grows in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia. Uses It is occasionally used as an ornamental plant.

Description An herbaceous perennial plant, it is the type species of Clarkia. This plant is , erect, branched or not, and covered with short hairs. The leaves alternate along the stalk and are lance to spoon-shaped, about long and sometimes finely toothed. The distinctive lavender to light purple flowers are four-lobed and fused at the base. Each lobe is in turn three-lobed with the middle lobe widest. Distribution Clarkia pulchella is found in the Pacific Northwest mainly east of the Cascade Range in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, the southern margin of British Columbia and the extreme west of Montana. Occurring over a wide range of elevations, it is most common from . Its habitat is often forest, rocky, grassland or disturbed. Discovery It was described by Meriwether Lewis close to Kamiah, Idaho during the Lewis and Clark expedition and it was subsequently brought back as a botanical specimen. The discovery was first described on May 28, 1806 by William Clark and subsequently by Lewis on June 1, 1806 in a journal entry stating that: > I met with a singular plant today in blume of which I preserved a specemine; > it grows on the steep sides of the fertile hills near this place, the radix > is fibrous, not much branched, annual, woody, white and nearly smooth. the > stem is simple branching ascending, 2¬Ω feet high celindric, villose and of a > pale red colour. the branches are but few and those near its upper > extremity. the extremities of the branches are flexible and are bent down > near their extremities with the weight of the flowers. the leaf is sissile, > scattered thinly, nearly linear tho' somewhat widest in the middle, two > inches in length absolutely entire, villose, obtusely pointed and of an > ordinary green. above each leaf a small short branch protrudes, supporting a > tissue of four or five smaller leaves of the same appearance with those > described. a leaf is placed underneath each branch, and each flower. the > calyx is a one flowered spathe. the corolla superior consists of four pale > purple petals which are tripartite, the central lobe largest and all > terminate obtusely; they are inserted with a long and narrow claw on the top > of the germ, are long, smooth, & deciduous. there are two distinct sets of > stamens the 1st or principal consist of four, the filaments of which are > capillary, erect, inserted on the top of the germ alternately with the > petals, equal short, membranous; the anthers are also four each being > elivated with its filament, they are linear and rather flat, erect sessile, > cohering at the base, membranous, longitudinally furrowed, twice as long as > the filament naked, and of a pale purple colour. the second set of stamens > are very minute are also four and placed within and opposite to the petals, > these are scarcely perceptible while the 1st are large and conspicuous; the > filaments are capillary equal, very short, white and smooth. the anthers are > four, oblong, beaked, erect, cohering at the base, membranous, shorter than > the filaments, white naked and appear not to form pollen. there is one > pistillum; the germ of which is also one, cilindric, villous, inferior, > sessile, as long as the 1st stamens, and marked with 8 longitudinal furrows. > the single style and stigma form a perfect monapetallous corolla only with > this difference, that the style which elivates the stigma or limb is not a > tube but solid tho' its outer appearance is that of the tube of a > monopetallous corolla swelling as it ascends and gliding in such manner into > the limb that it cannot be said where the style ends, or the stigma begins; > jointly they are as long as the corolla, white, the limb is four cleft, > saucer shaped, and the margins of the lobes entire and rounded. this has the > appearance of a monopetallous flower growing from the center of a four > petalled corollar, which is rendered more conspicuous in consequence of the > 1st being white and the latter of a pale purple.

A painting of Clarkia pulchella by Frederick Pursh It was not until 1814 however that the plant was classified and named Clarckia pulchella by Frederick Traugott Pursh in honor of Clark even though in his journal entry he acknowledged Lewis as the discoverer. At the time of its publication by Pursh it was the first species assigned to the newly created genus Clarckia. The genus was later renamed as Clarkia. Then in 1826 David Douglas brought back samples of the plant to England after an expedition to the northwest United States from 1824 to 1828. Clarkia pulchella is most famous for its use by botanist Robert Brown in the discovery of Brownian motion. Brown studied the pollen of Clarkia pulchella while immersed in water under the microscope. He used these pollen granules because they contain oblong particles, which he observed were 6 to 8 micrometres in length, and he thought that he could follow their progress during fertilization, which was the initial subject of his investigation. The plant is also known for its use by Newman and Pilson to demonstrate a causal relationship between genetic variation in a population and population survival. Notes References  *Brown, R. 1828.

The bar was launched in 1926 as Cadbury's Fruit & Nut, but was renamed Cadbury Dairy Milk Fruit & Nut in 2003. In the early years, along with the other Dairy Milk varieties, it was advertised as being essentially Dairy Milk with added ingredients. By the 1960s, each variety was advertised and branded separately, distancing itself from its Dairy Milk parent, in order to appeal to a younger market. The marketing approach produced a wide variety of wrappers and graphics. The \\"famous\\" Fruit and Nut UK television advert used the slogan 'Everyone's a fruit and nutcase', sung by humourist Frank Muir to the tune of the Danse des mirlitons from Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker.

By the 1980s, Cadbury went full circle and all branding and wrappers were again realigned with the Dairy Milk family; all wrappers became predominantly purple and so were more clearly Dairy Milk.

P. Taylor at his Windfields Farm (Maryland), Devil's Bag was out of the mare Ballade and sired by Halo, making him a full brother to both the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame inductee Glorious Song and Arlington Classic winner and very successful sire Saint Ballado.Devil's Bag's pedigree Devil's Bag was purchased as a yearling for $325,000 at the 1982 Keeneland July Selected Yearling Sale by the Hickory Tree Stable of James and Alice Mills. Racing career=1983:two-year-old season= Conditioned for racing by future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Woody Stephens, Devil's Bag was ridden by Eddie Maple. The colt won all five starts at age two by an average of five and a half lengths and was voted the American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt of 1983. His wins included the seven- furlong Cowdin Stakes in a stakes record time of 1:21.40 at Belmont Park. He set another stakes record at Belmont Park in winning the one-mile Champagne Stakes by six lengths, breaking Seattle Slew's 1976 record time. In his final race as a two-year-old, Devil's Bag won the 11/16 mile Laurel Futurity Stakes by five and a quarter lengths in a time of 1:42.20 that broke the track record set by Spectacular Bid. Scheduled to run in December's Remsen Stakes at Aqueduct Racetrack, while in training the colt stepped on a stone. Although the injury was very minor, his handlers chose not to race him again that year. On December 20, 1983, it was announced that a syndicate led by Seth Hancock's Claiborne Farm paid $36 million for Devil's Bag, the highest price for any 2-year-old in racing history, and the third highest for any race horse ever. Hancock said that the colt would be retired to stud at Claiborne Farm after his three-year-old racing season with his 1985 fee set at $1 million for his first stallion year.New York Times - December 21, 1983 =1984:three-year-old season= Devil's Bag was the winterbook favorite for the U.S. Triple Crown series.

However, on March 7 he suffered the first loss of his career in the 1‚Öõ mile Flamingo Stakes at Hialeah Park. After taking the lead heading for home, Devil's Bag suddenly slowed down and finished fourth. A March 12 article in Sports Illustrated called it \\"one of the most stunning surprises in recent racing history, for no 3-year-old since Secretariat, in 1973, had stirred the imagination more than Devil's Bag.\\" On April 19, Devil's Bag returned with an fifteen-length victory in the seven- furlong Forerunner Stakes at Keeneland Race Course and then won his next start on April 28 at Churchill Downs in the one-mile Derby Trial Stakes. He was the pre-race favorite for the May 5 Kentucky Derby. Then, on May 1, trainer Woody Stephens announced that Devil's Bag would not run in the Derby but that he might start in the Preakness Stakes. On May 7, it was announced that veterinarian Dr. Alex Harthill had discovered a small fracture in Devil's Bag's right front knee and that the colt would be retired from racing.

A member of the family Boletaceae, the mushrooms produced by the fungus have tubes and pores instead of gills on the underside of their caps. Exsudoporus frostii is distributed in the eastern United States from Maine to Georgia, and in the southwest from Arizona extending south to Mexico and Costa Rica. A mycorrhizal species, its fruit bodies are typically found growing near hardwood trees, especially oak. Exsudoporus frostii mushrooms can be recognized by their dark red sticky caps, the red pores, the network-like pattern of the stipe, and the bluing reaction to tissue injury. Another characteristic of young, moist fruit bodies is the amber-colored drops exuded on the pore surface. Although the mushrooms are considered edible, they are generally not recommended for consumption because of the risk of confusion with other poisonous red-pored, blue-bruising boletes. E. frostii may be distinguished from other superficially similar red-capped boletes by differences in distribution, associated tree species, bluing reaction, or morphology. Taxonomy The species was named by the Unitarian minister John Lewis Russell of Salem, Massachusetts, based on specimens found in Brattleboro, Vermont. He named the fungus after his friend, fellow amateur American mycologist Charles Christopher Frost, who published a description of the species in his 1874 survey of the boletes of New England. When the name of a species is contributed by an individual, but the name is formally published by another, the contributor's name can be cited, separated from the publishing author as apud; for this reason, the name and authority are written Boletus Frostii Russell apud Frost in some older literature. Bernard Ogilvie Dodge made reference to B. frostii in 1950 during an address to the Mycological Society of America, in which he spoke about the role of the amateur in discovering new species: \\"They would have informed us all about the man Russell, who named a fine new bolete for his friend Frost, and about the man Frost, who named a fine new bolete for his friend Russell. Boletus Frostii and Boletus Russellii are mushrooms with character, even though they were described by amateurs.\\" However, in attempting to establish a lectotype specimen, mycologist Roy Halling examined both Russell's original material and his accompanying notes; he concluded that it was Frost who made the original species determinations, further suggesting that \\"there is no evidence to show that Russell ever collected B. frostii or wrote a description of it.\\" William Murrill in 1909 placed the species in the genus Suillellus, while Sanshi Imai transferred it to Tubiporus in 1968. Tubiporus has since been synonymized with Boletus. In 1945, Rolf Singer described a bolete he found in Florida; although he originally described it as a subspecies of B. frostii, he later considered the differences between the taxa significant enough to warrant publishing Boletus floridanus as a unique species. Following recent molecular studies that outlined a new phylogenetic framework for the Boletaceae, the bolete was transferred to the newly circumscribed genus Exsudoporus in 2014. Exsudoporus frostii is commonly known as \\"Frost's bolete\\" or the \\"apple bolete\\". In Mexico, its vernacular name is panza agria, which translates to \\"sour belly\\". Description The shape of the cap of the young fruit body ranges from a half sphere to convex, later becoming broadly convex to flat or shallowly depressed, with a diameter of . The edge of the cap is curved inward, although as it ages it can uncurl and turn upward. In moist conditions, the cap surface is sticky as a result of its cuticle, which is made of gelatinized hyphae. If the fruit body has dried out after a rain, the cap is especially shiny, sometimes appearing finely areolate (having a pattern of block-like areas similar to cracked, dried mud). Young mushrooms have a whitish bloom on the cap surface. View of the hymenium The color is bright red initially, but fades with age. The flesh is up to thick, and ranges in color from pallid to pale yellow to lemon yellow. The flesh has a variable staining reaction in response to bruising, so some specimens may turn deep blue almost immediately, while others turn blue weakly and slowly. The tubes comprising the pore surface (the hymenium) are 9‚Äì15 mm deep, yellow to olivaceous yellow (mustard yellow), turning dingy blue when bruised. The pores are small (2 to 3 per mm), circular, and until old age a deep red color that eventually becomes paler. The pore surface is often beaded with yellowish droplets when young (a distinguishing characteristic), and readily stains blue when bruised. The stipe is long, and thick at its apex. It is roughly equal in thickness throughout its length, though it may taper somewhat toward the top; some specimens may appear ventricose (swollen in the middle). The stipe surface is mostly red, or yellowish near the base; it is reticulate‚Äîcharacterized by ridges arranged in the form of a net-like pattern. Mycelia, visible at the base of the stipe, are yellowish white to light yellow. Young fruit bodies may secrete an amber liquid. The spore print of E. frostii is olive brown. The spores are thick walled, smooth, and spindle shaped, with dimensions of 11‚Äì15 by 4‚Äì5 ¬µm. Longer spores up to 18 ¬µm long may also be present. The cap cuticle, or pileipellis, is made of a tangled layer of gelatinized hyphae that are 3‚Äì6 ¬µm wide. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are four spored and measure 26‚Äì35 by 10.5‚Äì11.5 ¬µm. Cystidia are non-fertile cells interspersed among the basidia, and they are prevalent in the hymenial tissue of E. frostii. These hyaline (translucent) cells measure 30‚Äì53 long by 7.5‚Äì14 ¬µm wide, and range in shape from somewhat like a spindle (tapering at each end, but with one end typically rounded) to subampullaceous‚Äîshaped somewhat like a swollen bottle. =Edibility and nutritional composition= In 1910, Murrill wrote of this mushroom's edibility: \\"Usually viewed with suspicion because of its red hymenium, but its properties are not accurately known.\\" Since then, several authors have advised against consuming the species, due to its resemblance to other toxic red-capped boletes. In his 100 Edible Mushrooms (2007), Michael Kuo notes that although the mushroom is apparently edible for some, it \\"affects others negatively\\". Despite these warnings, Exsudoporus frostii is edible, and David Arora mentions that it is commonly sold in rural markets in Mexico; a 1997 study suggests that it is only consumed in rural areas in Quer√©taro state. Its taste and odor have been described as \\"pleasant\\" or \\"sweet\\" and somewhat like citrus, although the cuticle of the cap may taste acidic. Chemical analysis of fresh fruit bodies collected in Mexico showed them to have the following composition: moisture 94.53%; ash 0.323%; dietary fiber 3.024%; fat 0.368%; and protein 1.581%. The free fatty acid content of dried fruit bodies was 4.5%, slightly more than the common button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus), which had 3.5%. The majority of this total was oleic acid (1.95%), followed by linoleic acid (1.68%) and palmitic acid (1.69%). =Similar species= Poisonous Boletus flammans is similar in appearance. Other red-capped boletes include the poisonous B. flammans and B. rubroflammeus; the former grows most commonly under conifers, the latter in association with hardwoods in eastern North America and southern Arizona. Often confused with E. frostii are E. permagnificus and B. siculus, but the latter two species are known only from Europe and always grow in association with oaks. The fruit bodies of young specimens of B. kermesinus, newly described from Japan in 2011, are similar in appearance to E. frostii. In addition to its distribution, B. kermesinus can be distinguished from E. frostii by having flesh that does not bruise blue and a stipe in which the reticulum is not as deep and coarse. B. pseudofrostii, found in Belize, produces smaller caps that are in diameter. Boletus russelli, found in eastern North America, has a red to reddish-brown cap and reticulate stipe, but its pore surface is yellow, and the fruit body does not bruise blue. Exsudoporus floridanus differs from E. frostii in having a lighter cap color and in the texture of the cap surface: it is tomentose (covered with dense, short, soft, matted hairs) or velutinous (like velvet), compared to the relatively smooth surface of E. frostii. Singer notes that although the physical characteristics between the two taxa may be blurred and are hard to define, the area of origin can reliably distinguish them: E. floridanus is found on shaded lawns and scrubland in open oak stands in non-tropical regions of Florida, typically on grassy or sandy soil, where it fruits between May and October. Ecology, habitat, and distribution Immature specimen with cap not fully expanded; bruising is evident on the stipe. Exsudoporus frostii is a mycorrhizal species, meaning that the fungus forms associations with the roots of various species of trees. These associations are mutualistic, because the fungus absorbs mineral nutrients from the soil and channels these into the plant, while the plant provides the fungus with sugars, a product of photosynthesis. The characteristic feature of the mycorrhiza is the presence of a sheath of fungal tissue that encases the terminal, nutrient-absorbing rootlets of the host plant. The fungus forms an extensive underground network of hyphae that radiate outward from the surface of the root sheath, effectively increasing the surface area for nutrient absorption. The hyphae also invade between the root cortical cells to form a Hartig net. Using pure culture techniques, Exsudoporus frostii has been shown to form mycorrhizae with Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana), while a field study confirms a similar association with the oak Quercus laurina. The fruit bodies grow solitarily, scattered, or in groups on the ground under hardwood trees; the fungus fruits in summer to early autumn. William Murrill noted its preference for growing in \\"thin oak woods, where the light is sufficient to enable grass to grow\\", and Alexander H. Smith mentioned its preference for growing in \\"thin, sandy soil under scrub oak.\\" In the United States, it is distributed from Maine south to Georgia, extending west to Tennessee and Michigan, and in southern Arizona. In Mexico, it is often found under Madrone. It has also been collected in Costa Rica, where it associates with the oak species Quercus copeyensis, Q. costaricensis, Q. rapurahuensis, and Q. seemanii. A 1980 publication tentatively suggested that the fungus was also present in Italy, but the author later determined that the putative E. frostii was actually Boletus siculus. Fruit bodies can be parasitized by the mold-like fungus Sepedonium ampullosporum. Infection results in necrosis of the mushroom tissue, and a yellow color caused by the formation of large amounts of pigmented aleurioconidia (single-celled conidia produced by extrusion from the conidiophores).

The model provides a framework for analyzing and interpreting social system change and its side effects from a communication perspective. It also suggests a methodology for acting as an intervener to encourage and/or discourage social system change.Opt, Susan K. & Gring, Mark A. (2009). The rhetoric of social intervention: An introduction. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications Inc. The model offers an alternative approach to understanding social system change by its emphasis on communication as the driver of change in contrast to models that focus on social, political, economic, and technological forces as catalysts for change. The RSI model is envisioned as three communication subsystems that function as starting points for interpreting or enacting social system change. The subsystems, known as attention, power, and need, form the RSI model framework. This entry describes the assumptive foundations of the RSI model. Then it discusses the attention, power, and need patterns of communication that that model identifies as points for generating social system change and continuity. RSI model foundations The beginnings of Brown's RSI model are reflected in three main documents‚Äîa book about Will Rogers that reports research on American dream ideology,Brown, William R. (1970). Imagemaker: Will Rogers and the American dream. Columbia, MO: University of Missouri Press. a book chapter that outlines how human beings strategically use symbols to create, maintain, and change symbolic realities,Brown, William R. (1972). Language and strategy. In J. Makay and W. Brown, The rhetorical dialogue: Contemporary concepts and cases.(pp. 365-433) Dubuque, IA: Wm. C. Brown Company Publishers. and a journal article in which he sketches the RSI model foundations by theorizing about the process by which human beings strategically use symbols to create, maintain, and change symbolically constructed ideology. =American Dream ideology= Imagemaker: Will Rogers and the American Dream was based on Brown's doctoral dissertation. An Oklahoman like Rogers, Brown was curious about Rogers' influence and popularity in the 1920s and 1930s. Brown researched the source of Rogers' ability to be persuasive and authoritative and concluded that it arose from Rogers' ability to embody and reflect characteristics that the U.S. public associated with the American dream. The book describes American dream attributes, such as \\"the dream of the dignity and worth of the individual, of freedom and equality, of success, and of progress,\\" and shows how Rogers symbolically identified with them.Brown, William R. (1970). Imagemaker: Will Rogers and the American dream. Columbia, MO: University of Missouri Press, p. 23. Although Brown acquired an in-depth understanding of American dream ideology, he later reported that the research left him wondering how social systems construct ideology. To address this question, Brown began reading books and articles on language, philosophy, rhetoric, and linguistics. =The naming process= A book chapter called Language and Strategy, written for The Rhetorical Dialogue: Contemporary Concepts and Cases, reflects Brown's initial investigations into the process by which human beings symbolically constitute reality, and, by extension, ideology. The chapter describes how human beings learn to categorize experience symbolically and how this symbolizing activity functions rhetorically. Brown draws his ideas for what he calls the \\"naming\\" process from scholars such as rhetorical theorist Kenneth Burke, philosopher Susanne Langer, psycholinguist Roger Brown, and psychologists Jerome Bruner, Jacqueline Goodnow, and George Austin.Burke, Kenneth. (1966). Language as symbolic action. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press.Langer, Susanne. (1980). Philosophy in a new key: A study in the symbolism of reason, rite, and art. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.Brown, Roger (1958). Words and things. New York, NY: The Free Press.Bruner, Jerome S., Goodnow, Jacqueline J., & Austin, George A. (1965). A study of thinking. New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Brown, building on the ideas of Roger Brown, says that human beings learn to name, or to transform experience into symbols, from language tutors, such as parents, peers, educators, and the media. He argues that human beings create names by abstracting from experience and then classifying those abstractions as \\"same as\\" or \\"different from\\" other symbolic categorizations for experience. Brown urges that all names are incomplete‚Äîas abstractions, they simultaneously direct attention to certain parts of experience and away from other parts of experience. Brown suggests that all names create expectancies about experience. He argues that this enables human beings to use names rhetorically to clarify ambiguous experience, to suggest approach or avoidance behavior toward experience, and to unite and divide experience. For example, naming a person's actions as \\"terrorism\\" clarifies the experience, suggests avoidance behavior, and divides that experience from ones named \\"guerilla warfare.\\" Brown closes the chapter by outlining what he calls the \\"rhetorical reasoning\\" process by which human beings advocate for their particular ways of naming experience. The process involves proposing a name, explaining how the name fits the experience, and then suggesting the expected response to experience based on the proposed name. Brown notes that in these discussions, negotiations, agreements, and disagreements about the symbolic classification of experience, human beings create symbolic reality. =The ideology process= In the article Ideology as Communication Process published in the Quarterly Journal of Speech, Brown merges his research in ideology and symbolic categorization to propose a model to describe the rhetorical process by which human beings create, maintain, and change ideology, and by extension, social systems. In two later articles, Brown refers to this model as the \\"rhetoric of social intervention.\\" In the Ideology article, Brown argues that the communication and creation of ideology occur simultaneously and, although a specific ideology might fade, the communication process of constituting, maintaining, and changing ideology is continuous. The RSI model directs attention to the continuous communication process that underlies social change and continuity. Brown defines ideology as \\"any symbolic construction of the world in whose superordinate 'name' human beings can comprehensively order their experience and subsume their specific activities.\\"Brown, William R. (1978). Ideology as communication process. Quarterly Journal of Speech, 64(2), 124. In essence, he views ideology as an ultimate symbolic categorization of all of experience that both creates and is shaped by a social system. Ideology is an overarching name that influences how social system participants make sense of their world, social hierarchy, and needs. At the same time, ideology emerges when participants symbolically constitute worldview, power, and need. For example, according to the RSI model, American dream ideology influences how U.S. Americans interpret their needs and roles in society, e.g., they need \\"freedom.\\" The actions they take toward achieving \\"freedom\\" also create American dream ideology. Extending Roger Brown, the RSI model holds that human beings learn ideology from language tutors. As they learn specific names for experience, they also learn the attributes and expectancies associated with the social system's symbolically constructed ideology. For example, the U.S. social system often identifies attributes such as individualism, freedom, equality, success, and progress with American dream ideology. American dream ideology creates the expectancy that a more perfect life can be achieved by pursuing those attributes. Brown theorizes that human beings construct ideology to meet an inherent human need for an ultimate sense of order, meaning, and explanation for all of experience. Thus, he identifies \\"ultimacy\\" as the primary attribute of ideology to distinguish it from names given to everyday experience. He writes that ideology is \\"that category of experience on which one is willing to bet the meaning of one's life.\\"Brown, William R. (1978). Ideology as communication process. Quarterly Journal of Speech, 64(2), 126. In the RSI model, ideology arises out of the naming process. Human beings create ideology by abstracting from and naming sensed and non-sensed experience. The model focuses on the symbolic abstraction process associated with the naming of worldview, relationships, and needs. The model refers to these three symbolic subsystems as attention, power, and need. Brown proposes that the subsystems are holistically interconnected, so that change in one brings about simultaneous change in the other two. Hence, the RSI model provides a systemic, or what Brown later calls an \\"holographic,\\" approach to understanding social system change. According to the RSI model, because ideology, like all names for experience, is abstractive, all ideologies are incomplete. Brown theorizes that human beings adhere to an ideology as long as it seems to make comprehensive sense of experience. The model predicts that because ideology is always incomplete, adherents will encounter anomalies‚Äîexperiences that violate or do not fit ideological expectancies. Human beings have an inherent need to avoid a sense of chaos or uncertainty, so they must find a way to account for or make sense of the anomalies to maintain a sense of order and meaning in life. Thus, Brown argues that the symbolic process by which human beings create and maintain ideology is paradoxically the same process that enables them to account rhetorically for the anomalies. He concludes that rhetorical interventions to address anomalies drive social system change. The RSI model directs attention to the rhetorical process by which human beings deal with anomalies by focusing on communication patterns associated with the symbolic construction of attention, power, and need. Brown views each of these symbolic subsystems as a starting point for analyzing and initiating communication interventions to promote and impede ideological and, by extension, social system change. Attention interventions The Ideology article refers to the attention subsystem as \\"input-switching.\\" Two later articles call the subsystem \\"attention.\\" In the RSI model, as human beings symbolically construct ideology, they create complex naming patterns to make sense of and interpret experience. They symbolically constitute templates or worldviews that give meaning to daily experience. They create these complex naming patterns (e.g., a good education will lead to a better life) by abstracting, or paying attention to some aspects of experience (foregrounding) and directing attention away from other aspects (backgrounding). Attention interventions occur when human beings attempt to account for anomalies in their complex naming patterns by communicatively shifting attention. Brown concludes that these rhetorical shifts in attention drive social system change. In the Attention and the Rhetoric of Social Intervention article, Brown describes in detail the attention intervention aspect of the RSI model. The RSI model holds that complex naming patterns create expectancies about experience (e.g., that getting a good education will make life better). But when lived experience fails to match the symbolically created expectancy (e.g., a person with a good education cannot find a job), the model suggests that human beings may become more attentive to anomalies in their naming pattern. Furthermore, the more widely human beings apply their naming patterns, the more likely they will encounter anomalies because all naming patterns are abstractions, or incomplete. Because human beings are assumed to have an inherent need for order and to make sense of experience, the model predicts that human beings will attempt to compensate symbolically for these anomalies. In the model, human beings communicatively promote or impede \\"attention switches\\" to compensate for anomalies so as to maintain meaning and order in their lives. Attention switching involves a symbolic recategorizing of experience or a renaming of the expectancies associated with a symbolic category. Attention switching occurs when human beings rhetorically shift what they attend to in experience. For example, instead of foregrounding education as the means to making a better life, they might shift to foregrounding spiritual development as the means to achieve a better life. Alternatively human beings could redefine \\"good education\\" as meaning only private education instead of all education. In both cases, the RSI model would say that human beings shifted attention to make sense of the anomaly in the \\"good education\\" template. According to the RSI model, the conditions for an attention switch exist when there are two or more complex naming patterns that can make sense of experience and a systemic shift occurs from one template to another. Attention interventions involve cycles of increased and decreased communication related to anomalies. In the cycle, (1) human beings communicatively increase attention to deviance between symbolically created expectancies and lived experience (anomalies), (2) they increasingly advocate alternative ways of knowing, being, and valuing to account for the anomalies, and (3) their openness to these alternative complex names to regain a sense of order and meaning increases. In the Attention article, Brown demonstrates RSI model concepts by examining the symbolic creation of the scientific worldview. He also applies the RSI model to identify attention switch cycles that generated social system shifts in U.S. black/white relationships from 1919-1965. The RSI model suggests that to promote an attention switch, interveners (persons attempting to bring about or prevent social change) communicatively feature attention to anomalies in currently held complex names. They advocate an alternative template that foregrounds aspects of experience that had been backgrounded in the currently held complex name. Their symbols mask attention to anomalies in the proposed naming pattern. Interveners that are attempting to prevent social system change communicatively feature attention to anomalies in the proposed template and mask attention to anomalies in the currently held naming pattern. During an attention switch, experience itself is assumed not to change. What changes is how human beings symbolically categorize the experience. Although experience does not change, the RSI model suggests that it appears different because of concurrent shifts in interpretations of power and need. The shift to a new worldview brings about corresponding shifts in symbolic categorizations of needs and power relationships as well as an alternative social system future. The RSI model predicts that after human beings shift attention to a new naming pattern, they eventually will also encounter anomalies in that pattern itself because all naming patterns are incomplete. The cycle of attention switching will begin again. Thus, although the content of a naming pattern may change, the communication process of creating, maintaining and changing naming patterns is continuous. In the RSI model, the attention subsystem is one starting point for the rhetorical analysis of or the intervention in social system change. Alternatively, social change can also be examined from the starting point of the symbolic construction of power. Power interventions The Ideology article refers to the power subsystem as \\"interpersonal categorizing.\\" Two later articles call the subsystem \\"power.\\" In the RSI model, human beings are interdependent with others in the symbolic construction and sharing of needs and power. The model holds that social systems arise out of the naming of relationships. Human beings interpersonally categorize to create and reify roles, social hierarchy, and relationship rules. In creating social order, human beings also create ideology. At the same time, ideology influences the social system participants' assumptions about social hierarchy. Power interventions occur when human beings attempt to account for anomalies in symbolically created hierarchy. These rhetorical interventions drive social system change and continuity. In the Power and the Rhetoric of Social Intervention article, Brown describes in detail the power intervention aspect of the RSI model. Brown defines power as the degree to which human beings feel interdependent with others in fulfilling needs and in choosing futures. In the RSI model, human beings form power-sharing social systems in which they share responsibility for meeting needs and making choices that shape the social system's future. The RSI model treats power as a communication medium that provides rules or power codes for taking actions and/or making decisions without deliberation. Brown posits that relational names communicate what sociologist Niklas Luhmann calls \\"power codes\\" that shape relationship participants' choices and behaviors.Luhmann, Niklas. (1979). Trust and power. Chichester, England: John Wiley & Sons. For example, in the relational name \\"teacher/student,\\" students typically choose to follow the teacher's direction, such as doing homework, because of social system expectancies associated with that relationship. At the same time, teachers usually follow the social system's expected rules for behavior, such as treating all students fairly. According to the model, human beings create power through communication by symbolically constituting relationships. They create relationships by naming people as \\"same as\\" or \\"different from\\" each other and acting as if those similarities and differences are real and have meaning. As human beings learn relational names from language tutors, they learn expectancies the social system associates with those names. Thus, in the model, relational names are non-sensed or symbolic abstractions, which human beings make real in how they behave toward others and in objects created to represent relational names. For example, the stripes on a person's shirt and the social expectation that this person will salute officers make real the symbolic category \\"sergeant.\\" The RSI model holds that social hierarchy arises out of naming relationships \\"same\\" and \\"different.\\" In the model, relational names that emphasize similarities between self and other are called \\"complementary\\" (e.g., friends, coworkers). These names convey the expectancy of equality. Relational names that emphasize differences are called \\"reciprocal\\" (e.g., winner/loser, coach/player). These names convey the expectancy of inequality. Social hierarchy is composed of complementary and reciprocal relationships. The social hierarchy becomes a symbolic reality when human beings act as if these relationships are real and that their expectancies have power. According to the model, when expectancies associated with relational names are violated, conditions for a power intervention exist. For example, if the teacher does not treat students fairly, the students might attempt a power intervention by complaining to the teacher's superior or by dropping the class. More specifically, power interventions involve cycles of attention shifts from cooperation to maintain the current social hierarchy to competition by offering an alternative hierarchy, and vice versa. In the cycle, (1) human beings communicatively increase attention to anomalies in social hierarchy, (2) they increasingly advocate alternative ways of social organizing based on exchange, threat, or , and (3) they become more open to alternative social hierarchies to regain social order. Human beings attribute motives in the choice to cooperate or challenge social hierarchy. Brown draws upon economist Kenneth Boulding's ideas about social organizers to suggest motives that human beings attribute to relationships‚Äîexchange, threat, and .Boulding, Kenneth. (1978). Ecodynamics: A new theory for societal evolution.Beverly Hills, CA: Sage Publications For example, human beings cooperate because they expect something in return (exchange). They cooperate because they expect a negative outcome if they do not cooperate (threat). They cooperate because of an interpretation of shared human identity (). Like attention interventions, power interventions occur in communication interactions. The RSI model suggests that to encourage a power shift, interveners communicatively create social disorder by foregrounding anomalies in the current social hierarchy template. They advocate alternative ways of social organizing as the means to regain social order. To prevent a power shift and maintain the current social hierarchy, interveners communicatively foreground anomalies in the proposed template. They advocate ways to account for the anomalies in the current template. They attempt to dissuade openness to alternative ways of social organizing. In both cases, Brown concludes that communication drives social system change and continuity. Because social hierarchy is a symbolic abstraction, it will always be incomplete and imperfect. As human beings shift from one social hierarchy to another, the newly adopted hierarchy will one day appear non-needs meeting. Thus, in the model, a continuous cycle of power shifts occur from cooperation to competition and vice versa in the symbolic creation of power. In the Power article, Brown traces social hierarchy shifts in black/white relationships from the 1910s to the 1970s through the lens of the RSI model. He also examines the power intervention strategies, tactics, and maneuvers of New York urban planner Robert Moses to demonstrate RSI model concepts. The RSI model predicts that shifts in the symbolic categorization of power also result in need and attention shifts. Attention shifts occur as human beings pay attention to different aspects of experience to promote or prevent power shifts. Need interventions occur as shifts in power result in changes in interpretations of needs. As with the attention subsystem, the model views the power subsystem as one entry point for analyzing and intervening in social system change. Alternatively, social system change can be examined from the perspective of the need subsystem. Need interventions The Ideology article refers to the need subsystem as \\"intrapersonal categorizing.\\" Two later articles call the subsystem \\"need.\\" In the RSI model, human beings have an innate need for a sense of order in self‚Äîto know who they are, their role in society, and who and what around them is important and meaningful. Social systems construct ideology to satisfy that need, just as the constructed ideology shapes how social system participants interpret their needs. Need interventions occur when human beings attempt to account for anomalies in their symbolically constructed interpretations of needs. More specifically, the RSI model holds that human beings have two types of needs: biosocial and symbolic. Biosocial needs are innate needs, necessary for growth and survival, which are expressed in communication (e.g., when a person says, \\"I need water\\" to fulfill a biological need for water). Symbolic needs are those constituted by communication (e.g., when a person says, \\"I need Brand X water\\" because advertisers have persuaded the person to interpret Brand X as better meeting the need for health than tap water). In both cases, human beings create interdependencies with others to fulfill biosocial and symbolic needs. They learn from language tutors the social system's assumptions about what needs are important and how needs should be communicated and satisfied. Brown draws upon social anthropologist Edmund Leach's idea of code-switching to explain how human beings create needs symbolically.Leach, Edmund. (1976). Culture and communication: The logic by which symbols are connected. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Leach writes that human beings talk and act as if non-sensed or abstract concepts exist in the physical world (e.g., marriage, prosperity, recession), having \\"forgotten\\" that they symbolically constructed these concepts. They code switch, or act as if the non-sensed is now the sensed. Need interventions involve cycles of increased and decreased communication to anomalies in symbolic constructions of needs. Brown theorizes that need interventions involve cycles that alternate between attributing and denying individual- and group-oriented needs. In the cycle, (1) human beings communicatively increase awareness or attention to unmet or attributed/denied needs, (2) they increase advocacy behavior toward those perceived as being able to meet the need, and (3) they become more open to those who can respond to attributed or denied need. The model predicts that once a particular need has been fulfilled, then attention to that particular need decreases, advocacy behavior decreases, and openness to others decreases. At the same time, attention to \\"new\\" needs increases. In addition, if a need goes unmet and the human beings advocating the need continually encounter non-needs meeting responses, they might begin advocating the need in ways that the social system names as inappropriate (e.g., shifting from protests to setting buildings on fire). Alternatively, the needs advocates might rename the need in a way that diminishes its urgency and shift attention to other needs. According to the model, to promote a shift in needs, an intervener communicatively increases attention to how current needs are not being met or how needs expectancies are unfulfilled. Then the intervener advocates an alternative interpretation of needs and shows how it makes better sense of experience in the attempt to increase others' openness to this needs proposal. To prevent a shift in needs, an intervener foregrounds anomalies in the proposed interpretation of needs. Then the intervener advocates a way to account for anomalies in the currently existing interpretation of needs to attempt to maintain the current interpretation of needs. In both cases, communication drives social system change and continuity. Because the RSI model is systemic, the need subsystem is assumed to be interconnected with the power and attention subsystems. Thus, as interpretations of needs change, so do interpretations of power relationships within the social system. In addition, attention shifts occur when the social system emphasizes different types of needs (individual or group) Social system interventions Although Brown presents the RSI model as three subsystems, he theorizes that social system intervention is an holistic process that involves all three subsystems simultaneously. He explains that human beings' linear language limits their ability to talk about all three subsystems concurrently. Thus, when analyzing or enacting interventions, human beings tend to emphasize one subsystem and background the other two. The RSI model treats the shifts in the backgrounded subsystems as \\"side effects\\" of the primary subsystem intervention. In addition, in the RSI model, all social system interventions involve multiple interveners. Brown notes, though, that the linear nature of language often results in human beings acting as if one person or group is the primary intervener. The RSI model suggests that all social system change attempts are influenced simultaneously by interveners communicating to promote change and interveners communicating to impede change. Brown names his model \\"social intervention\\" to emphasize his conclusion that any attempt to encourage or discourage social system change is an intervention, not control or manipulation. He argues that the interconnected nature of the subsystems and the communication actions of multiple interveners mean that the outcome of any attempted system change evidences multi-causation. Thus, Brown views social intervention as a communication act that attempts to \\"nudge\\" a social system toward or away from a particular way of naming worldview, power, and needs. Overall, the RSI model is conceived of as a framework for analyzing and tracking the communication patterns that generate social system change and continuity. It also can be viewed as a methodology to guide efforts to promote and/or prevent social system change.Opt, Susan K. (2008). Public relations and the rhetoric of social intervention. In T. L.

Union Now is a book by journalist Clarence Streit calling for a federal union of fifteen of the world's major democracies. The first edition of the book was published in 1939. The book attracted public attention to world federalist and Atlanticist ideas and helped lay the groundwork for the efforts of Streit's organization Federal Union, Inc. (which later became the Association to Unite the Democracies).  Background  As a New York Times correspondent at the League of Nations, Streit was disturbed by the democracies' apparent inability to deal with such crises as the Japanese invasion of Manchuria and the rise of Nazism. He came to the conclusion that at the root of the League's problems were nationalism and the democracies' ignorance of their own share of the world's economic and military power.'Elijah *from Missoula', Time, 27 March 1950. Streit began work on his proposal for a union of democracies in 1933. In 1938, with world war appearing increasingly likely, the book was accepted for publication by Harper & Brothers.Lynn Darling, 'The 50-Year Mission; Clarence Streit's Dream of a Transatlantic Union and the Promise of Peace', Washington Post, . p. B1.  Summary  Streit proposed a \\"nucleus\\" of fifteen nations that he regarded as relatively mature democracies: The United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Ireland, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland. This union was to be organized roughly along the lines of the federal system of the United States: while some power would be ceded to the newly established central authority, each nation would retain some measure of sovereignty. Nations that the federation deemed worthy of membership would be added subsequently on the basis of their commitment to democracy, with the hope that the union would eventually come to encompass the entire globe.  Reception and legacy  Writing in the New York Times, historian James Truslow Adams offered cautious praise for Streit's proposal, stating that \\"[s]ome day, in the kind of world we live in, with space annihilated and interdependence between nations complete, something like what Mr. Streit suggests will have to come to pass.\\"James Truslow Adams, 'A Union of the Democracies: Mr. Streit's Plan for a Federation to Safeguard the World's Peace', The New York Times, 19 February 1939. p. 85. Philip Kerr, 11th Marquess of Lothian also praised the book, describing Streit's plan as a democratic, peaceful alternative to the ideological visions provided by fascism and communism.'New Peace Plan Hailed by Lothian', The New York Times, 6 March 1939. p. 3. However, it was partly in response to Union Now that George Orwell wrote his famous essay \\"Not Counting Niggers\\", in which he called the 'democratic' character of Streit's proposed union into doubt. While writing that Streit had \\"an essentially decent cast of mind,\\" Orwell expressed pessimism about Streit's mission: > [O]ne begins to see what would really be happening if Mr Streit's scheme > were put into operation. The British and French empires, with their six > hundred million disenfranchised human beings, would simply be receiving > fresh police forces; the huge strength of the USA would be behind the > robbery of India and Africa.

They were produced to fill a need for target rifles by the Danish shooting association - De Danske Skytteforeninger.http://www.skytten.dk/Admin/Public/DWSDownload.aspx?File=%2fFiles%2fFiler%2fGod+viden%2fSKV%2fPDF%2fModelbetegnelser- Mauser.pdf The M52 was superseded by later variants (M58, M58E and M69) the last of which remained in production until the 1970s. It had a similar development path to other Scandinavian target rifles derived from German M98 and other Mauser actions, such as the Kongsberg M59 and Carl Gustaf M63. The Search for a New Target Rifle At the end of World War II the Danish shooting association faced a shortage of target rifles. The pre-war standard rifle, a variant of the Krag-J√∏rgensen in 6.5√ó55mm,http://world.guns.ru/rifle/repeating-rifle/usa/krag-e.html was complex to produce, obsolescent and it was not deemed practical to place it back in production. In any case, the .30-06 M1917 Enfield was the Danish Army's interim standard rifle, which would be soon replaced by the US M1 Garand, also in .30-06, and the Krag-J√∏rgensen action was not strong enough for the powerful US round. In a development path also followed concurrently by other Scandinavian countries, notably Norway with the Kongsberg M59, the Danes turned to the substantial quantity of Mauser 98 rifles left behind by the recently surrendered German forces. These were ideal in many respects. The action was much stronger than that of the Krag-J√∏rgensen, was suitable for the 6.5√ó55mm still favoured by Danish marksmen, and could handle the slightly longer .30-06 cartridge with some minor modifications. It was a strong action eminently suited for use in a target rifle and a target rear sight could be mounted on the receiver bridge. Most importantly, it was available in the numbers required. A variety of different Mauser M98 actions were represented. Although there was a large number of Kar98ks and some WW1 Gewehr 98s, many of the ex-German rifles were the Czechoslovakian vz. 24, known in German service as the G24(t). Of superb quality, the Czech-made actions were almost identical to German-manufactured Kar98k actions, with the exception of markings and the use of a straight bolt handle projecting at right angles from the action. The German Kar98k bolt handle was turned down to bring it closer to the stock and the firer's hand, with a corresponding recess in the stock. Design Details and Conversion To produce a M52, Schultz & Larsen stripped an ex-German rifle, checked the action and replaced the military 7.92√ó57mm barrel with its own heavy target barrel in either .30-06 or 6.5√ó55mm. In the case of the .30-06, the magazine was lengthened and the feed ramp re-profiled to suit. The trigger mechanism was honed for a better trigger pull. The metal parts were refinished, and the forend of the military stock was shortened and reamed out to accept the larger-diameter target barrel. The stock was then finely polished and target sling swivels installed.Book of Rifles by W. H. Smith and Joseph E. Smith, 1975, The steel Mauser buttplate remained. Both the foresight and aperture rearsight, and the sight picture they provided, were designed to be similar to the M1 Garand.Book of Rifles by W. H. Smith and Joseph E. Smith, 1975, p163p436 Rifles of the World by John Walter, KP books; 2nd edition, July 1998. The rearsight could be adjusted from 200 to 500 metres and was affixed to the receiver bridge with 2 screws. As it projected far enough forward to prevent loading with the standard 5-round Mauser clips, there was no need to cut a notch out of the rear of the receiver ring as done on the Kongsberg M59 to facilitate clip loading with the longer .30-06 round. However the 5-round magazine remained usable, and could still be loaded with single rounds. Variants=M58= The operation and sight picture provided by the M52 sights were designed to be similar to those of the M1 Garand service rifle in order to ensure training commonality for reservists,Book of Rifles by W. H. Smith and Joseph E. Smith, 1975, p163 but target shooting was growing more specialised, and some shooters were demanding a greater degree of adjustability.Book of Rifles by W. H. Smith and Joseph E. Smith, 1975, p163 Accordingly, Schultz and Larsen introduced the M58, which was identical to the M52 except for the use of micrometer-adjustable Schultz and Larsen M24 target rearsight, and a tunnel-type target front sight with replaceable elements.http://www.skytten.dk/Admin/Public/DWSDownload.aspx?File=%2fFiles%2fFiler%2fGod+viden%2fSKV%2fPDF%2fModelbetegnelser- Mauser.pdf It retained the use of the ex-military stock with the shortened forend. Various bolt handle configurations have been observed; the Kar98k turned down type was usually left as-is, but the straight vz. 24 handle was often partially turned down. =M58E= The M58E was produced for the British market,p436 Rifles of the World by John Walter, KP books; 2nd edition, July 1998. and so was available in 7.62√ó51mm NATO. It too was based on the refurbished Mauser military action, but was fitted with a new heavier target- style stock which was fitted with a broad forend and full curve pistol grip. The butt had a high comb, a cheekpiece and a rubber buttplate. The Schultz & Larsen target barrel was of heavier profile than preceding versions, and Parker or similar target sights were fitted, which put the eyepiece further to the rear than Danish versions. The new stock gave the rifle a family resemblance that was similar to other Scandinavian military target rifles such as the Carl Gustaf M63 and the Kongsberg M59, although without the top wood covering the barrel of the latter two rifles. =M69= Schultz & Larsen M69 Target Rifle in 7.62√ó51mm NATO. The M69 was of very similar appearance to the M58E and retained the refurbished Mauser military action, but with some detail differences amongst which the bolt handle was reshaped to a lower profile, fitting into a Kar98k-style recess in the stock on some examples. It was available chambered in 6.5√ó55mm Swedish Mauser and 7.62√ó51mm NATO. An excellent fully adjustable Schultz & Larsen match trigger replaced the polished military trigger used in earlier versions. Markings Earlier versions retained the German receiver ring markings, but some rifles, especially later ones, had them removed and a new serial number was added to the right side of the receiver above the stock line. The left side of the receiver retained the original markings. Barrels had a calibre designation stamp near the breech and a SCHULTZ & LARSEN OTTERUP or GEVAERFABRIKEN OTTERUP (early examples) marking applied to the barrel. Bolts were usually re-numbered to match the receiver, but old numbers remained visible on some bolt parts, trigger guards and magazine floorplates.

Several of the houses have been designated as Grade I listed buildings. North Parade was part of a wider scheme to build a Royal Forum, including South Parade, Pierrepont and Duke Streets, similar to Queen Square, which was never completed. Wood designed the facade, of Bath stone, after which a variety of builders completed the work with different interiors and rear elevations. Many of the buildings are now hotels and shops whilst some remain as private residences. The three-storey house at Number 1 was the home of John Palmer, who owned the Theatre Royal, Bath and instigator of the British system of mail coaches that was the beginning of the great British post office reforms with the introduction of an efficient mail coach delivery service in Great Britain during the late 18th century. He was Mayor of Bath on two occasions and Comptroller General of the Post Office, and later served as Member of Parliament for the constituency of Bath between 1801 and 1807. Numbers 2 to 6 were converted into a hotel, which included some alterations to the fabric of the building. Numbers 7 to 12 include a central projection and pediments over the doors. Number 9 is connected with Wordsworth and number 11 was home to Edmund Burke and Oliver Goldsmith, of the literary Club, in 1771. The final house, number 14, is faces the River Avon and adjoins the last house in Duke Street. It was known as Sheridan House, and later as the Gay Hotel. In the garden below the house is a little grotto dedicated to Delia. North Parade Bridge was built almost 100 years later in 1836 by William Tierney Clark. His original bridge was made of cast iron on stone abutments, with lodges and staircases. This was rebuilt in 1936, being refaced in stone over a new reinforced concrete superstructure which replaced the two outside ribs of the original eight cast-iron arches. The entrance to the council-run Sports and Leisure Centre on the Recreation Ground is to the east of the bridge. Further east on North Parade Road is the Bath Cricket Club Ground, and the Bath Law Courts which holds the Bath Magistrates' Court and the Bath County Court and Family Court.

It was originally published in Copenhagen by Det Schubotheske Forlag as part of a collection of four stories entitled Stille Eksistenser (Quiet Existences), centering on women who are subdued or living in isolation. It was first published independently in 1898. An impressionist novel, it relates the story of Katinka, a sensitive but ambitious young woman married to a boisterous and somewhat vulgar station master, Bai. At the time of release in Denmark in 1886, critics from the daily newspapers were generally enthusiastic about Ved Vejen. It is now considered an important contribution to Danish literature, listed in the Danish Culture Canon. In 1988 it was made into a feature film Katinka, directed by Max von Sydow. Background Herman Bang's novel was inspired by an incident in 1883 when he was passing through Sk√∏rping Station in the north of Jutland. He noticed a young woman at the window who, her pale face couched in her hands, stared after his departing train. In the introduction to Stille Eksistenser he explains: \\"For the rest of the journey, I could see the woman's face between the flowers. Her look was not quite one of longing ‚Äî longing would have perhaps fluttered to death by breaking its wings in such tight confines ‚Äî just a quite resignation, a waning sorrow. And when the train had slid by, she would be peering out with the same look over Egnens Lyng ‚Äî over the dreary plain.\\" Bang started writing the novel in 1885 in Vienna, after remembering Sk√∏rping Station: \\"It was in one of those windows behind the flowers that I saw her face, a face which I had not been able to erase from my memory for two years and which, as if a painter, I felt like drawing in soft, melancholic, almost blurry lines and using it as a kind of cover illustration for this book.\\" Plot A memory of Sk√∏rping Station led to Ved Vejen The novel centres on the character of Katinka Bai, a quiet, sensitive young woman married to a boisterous and somewhat vulgar station master, Bai. The marriage is barren, and she remains isolated. Almost subconsciously, she passionately longs after something undefinable. Even after the arrival of Huus, a neighbour with whom she begins to establish a promising relationship, she is unable to fulfill her passion, although for the first time in her life she falls in love. In the small provincial community where they live, neither she nor Huus dares to break the conventions they know, sad as it all may be. When they realize they cannot take their attachment any further, they decide to separate and Huus leaves the country. At the end of the novel, as at the beginning, Katinka stands by the wayside, observing life glide by.Nanna R√∏rdam Knudsen, \\"Ved Vejen\\", LitteraturSiden.dk. Retrieved 20 January 2013.\\"Herman Bang: Ved Vejen (1886)\\", Silkeborg Bibliotekere. Retrieved 25 February 2013. Themes In Ved Vejen, Bang has masterfully developed his impressionistic style. While recognizing that impressionism was first and foremost a trend in painting, he explained in a letter sent to Peter Nansen from Prague that he was trying to achieve the same style in literature: \\"Impressionistic is indeed the word. I am frantically striving to make every single impression clear and precise and distinctive, and so I never think about the whole\\"Johannes Fibiger, \\"Hvordan Bang blev forfatter\\", Forfatterweb. Retrieved 11 February 2013. Jean-Claude Polet adds that while he owes much to Zola, Daudet and Maupassant, he channels naturalism into a quite unexpected direction, that of impressionism. His characters are revealed through their responses or a slight turn of phrase along the lines of the Norwegian Jonas Lie or the Russian Turgenev. He does not explain, he merely presents a picture, providing the reader with impressions, allowing him to read between the lines, interpreting what lies behind the words. On meeting Claude Monet, he was told, \\"You are the first impressionist writer.\\" A recognized example of his mastery of impressionism is the novel's opening scene where all the characters meet at the station. Depiction of Katinka Bai Longtime Scandinavian Studies scholar Niels Ingwersen states that the novel \\"engagingly, ironically, sadly captures the quite trivial life of a rural, provincial community\\" and illustrates an unconsummated love relationship between two ordinary people. He highlights the \\"amazingly suggestive impressionism\\" of the novel which permits the reader to become more intimate with the characters, especially the scene at the vicar's party which provides a vivid image of the personalities of the people attending it, with their individual voices coming together to form a complete picture. Although Katinka Bai, a timid individual, is not a heroine in comparison with today's depiction of a strong independent woman, the reader is naturally drawn to empathize with her situation and with her as a character. Critical response The novel, like Bang's other works such as Stuk (1887), Tine (1889), and Ludvigsbakke (1896), is still widely read in Denmark, confirming the author as one of Denmark's leading novelists. At the time of release in Denmark in 1886, the daily newspapers were generally enthusiastic about Ved Vejen. Writing in Politiken, Edvard Brandes, after referring to the novel's \\"outrageous style\\", welcomed it as a \\"quite excellent novel\\" which was \\"so specially Danish\\". He concluded by calling for it to be widely read as \\"the best new literature we have seen this autumn\\".Edvard Brandes \\"Literatur: Herman Bang. Stille Eksistenser\\", Politiken, 12 November 1886. Retrieved 25 February 2013. In Social-Demokraten, C.E. Jensen found that Bang \\"depicts the infinitely simple existence and everything it covers with the finest and most sensitive art... His style gives the reader an impression of reality's monotony, allowing him to imagine the emotions hidden behind it.\\"C.E. Jensen, \\"Herman Bang: Stille Eksistenser\\", Social-Demokraten, 24 November 1886. Retrieved 25 February 2013. Vilhelm M√∏ller of Nutiden i Billeder og Text praised Ved Vejen as the best of the four stories in Stille Eksistenser, \\"containing all Bang's qualities in good measure and very few of the weaknesses which have disrupted his earlier work. It can certainly be favourably compared with all the novels of the past year.\\"Vilhelm M√∏ller, \\"Herman Bangs Noveller\\", Nutiden i Billeder og Text, 5 December 1886. Retrieved 25 February 2013. Only Berlingske Tidende's (unnamed) critic was dismissive, commenting: \\"The story Ved Vejen is weak in content and often unreadable in form... We recommend the author to be less nervous, less jumpy and less impressionistic.\\"\\"Herman Bang's Stille Eksistenser\\", Berlingske Tidende, 11 December 1886. Retrieved 25 February 2013. In selecting Ved Vejen for the Danish Culture Canon, the selection committee operating under the Danish Ministry of Culture explained that the attraction of the novel is that it portrays with considerable empathy how a meek young woman becomes increasingly aware of desires she hardly knew she possessed. With bittersweet irony, the author allows Katinka to develop her infatuation by listening to the heartaches of others. With its almost cinematic sequences, the novel conveys a balance between its subdued humour and a strong sympathy for what goes on in people's minds, especially in a secluded environment removed from mainstream society. It is not just Bang's portrayal of a bygone provincial world that seems so typically Danish but his mastery in making the hidden pain of loneliness so meaningful to today's readership.\\"Ved Vegen\\" , Kulturkanonen.

History The Manor was modelled on a Scottish hunting lodge, and was constructed in 1932 by Sir David Duncan, a member of the Mackintosh family, of Mackintosh's Toffee fame, originally sitting on of land running down to the Mbagathi River, the southern boundary of the city of Nairobi.

Life as a giraffe sanctuary Giraffe poking its head through the front door of Giraffe Manor. Shortly after purchasing the Manor, the Leslie-Melvilles learned that the only remaining Rothschild giraffes in Kenya were in danger due to a compulsory purchase by the Kenyan government of an privately owned ranch at Soy, near Eldoret, which was the Rothschilds' sole habitat in Kenya. Inevitably, the government's purchase would result in the land being sub-divided into smallholdings, and the giraffe being slaughtered. Since the Manor was already home to three wild bull giraffes (nicknamed Tom, Dick and Harry), the Leslie-Melvilles agreed to rehome one of the giraffe, an , 450-pound baby they named Daisy, about whom Betty subsequently wrote the book \\"Raising Daisy Rothschild\\", later turned into the film, The Last Giraffe. Daisy was soon joined by another baby giraffe, Marlon (named after Marlon Brando), and since then the Manor, in conjunction with locations such as Woburn Safari Park in Bedfordshire, England, has run a breeding programme to reintroduce the Rothschild giraffe into the wild to expand the gene pool. Part of the land of the Manor is given over to the Giraffe Centre, run by the African Fund for Endangered Wildlife, a charitable organisation set up by the Leslie Melvilles and Betty's daughter in 1972. By tradition, the giraffe themselves are named after individuals who have contributed significantly (whether financially or otherwise) to the work of AFEW, such as Lynn, named for author and journalist Lynn Sherr, a giraffe devotee who wrote an entire book devoted to the creature. Life as a hotel In 1983, Rick Anderson (Betty's son) and his wife moved onto the \\"Giraffe Manor Hotel\\" property to take over management of Giraffe Manor as a small, private hotel where guests could feed the giraffe from their breakfast table, through the front door, and out of their 2nd story bedroom window. The Manor has twelve bedrooms, one of which is furnished with the belongings of famous writer Karen Blixen (aka Isak Dinesen). Over the years, the Manor has welcomed guests such as Ellen DeGeneres, Portia de Rossi, Ellie Goulding, Naomi Watts, Eddie Vedder and Walter Cronkite (after whom one of the Manor's resident warthogs was named), Johnny Carson, Brooke Shields and Richard Chamberlain, as well as hosting Richard Branson, Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman on the launch of Virgin Atlantic's London‚ÄìNairobi service in 2007.

Life  Born in Basel, Joanna was the eldest daughter of Count Ulrich III of Pfirt (1281‚Äì1324), a descendant of the Scarponnois count Theodoric I of Montb√©liard, and his wife, Joanna of Burgundy (1284‚Äì1349). = Inheritance = When Reginald of Burgundy, the last Count of Montb√©liard from the Chalon-Arlay dynasty, died in 1321, his daughter, Joanna of Montb√©liard (Joanna of Pfirt's mother), inherited her father's domains. Joanna and Ulrich III had four daughters and no sons. When Count Ulrich died in March 1324, he left large estates in the Alsatian Sundgau, in the southern Vosges Mountains with the strategically important Burgundian Gate, and in the northern Jura foothills. Ulrich's surviving legacy was his two daughters, Joanna of Pfirt and her younger sister Ursula (1315‚Äì1367). Duke Leopold I of Austria was head of the Habsburg dynasty since the death of his father, King Albert I of Germany, in 1308. He concentrated on the administration of the family's Further Austrian territories in Swabia, while his brother Frederick the Fair rivalled with King Louis the Bavarian. When Leopold found out that the late Count of Pfirt's daughter, Joanna was still unmarried, he sent his younger brother Albert II to make the official request to Joanna of Montb√©liard for her daughter's hand. With the lands of Pfirt, Joanna was an attractive party. Joanna ceded her domains (including the town of Belfort) to the House of Habsburg, whereby the dynasty could add a large contiguous territory in Southern Alsace to its Swabian possessions. The treaty between Joanna and Duke Leopold was sealed on March 17 at Thann Joanna's mother was however remarried to Rudolf Hesso, Margrave of Baden-Baden and had two more daughters: Margaret and Adelaide. = Marriage = Statue of Joanna in Saint Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna Joanna married Albert II in Vienna on 26 March 1324. At first the marriage went off unhappily. Joanna was considered to be well into child bearing years. The couple had children early in their marriage, but they were all short-lived (all buried in St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna). In total, Albert and Joanna had five short-lived children throughout their marriage. Albert II succeeded as Duke of Austria and Styria upon the death of Frederick the Fair in 1330. However, at the same time, he fell ill with polyarthritis which paralyzed his legs, which seemed to preclude producing heirs. For divine aid, the duke went on a pilgrimage to Cologne and Aachen in 1337. Two years later, when Joanna was in her late thirties, she gave birth to a son and continued to have children. In total Albert and Joanna had six surviving children: # Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria (November 1, 1339, Vienna - July 27, 1365, Milan). Married but line extinct. # Catherine (1342, Vienna - 10 January 1381, Vienna), Abbess of St. Klara in Vienna. # Margaret (1346, Vienna - 14 January 1366, Brno), married: ## in Passau 4 September 1359 Count Meinhard III of Gorizia-Tyrol; ## in Vienna 1364 Margrave Johann Heinrich of Moravia. # Frederick III, Duke of Austria (1347, Vienna - 1362, Vienna).

Joanna was described as wise and prudent.Translation from German Wikipedia She was said to be politically talented and smart. In 1336, Joanna mediated the peace between the Habsburg family and the rising House of Luxembourg over the heritage of the late Duke Henry of Carinthia. The Habsburgs later gained further possessions up to the Adriatic coast, formerly held by the Patriarchs of Aquileia. Through Joanna, Albert and the Habsburgs gained more lands since she was an heiress. Even though there was peace, wars could break out if it promised benefits for Albert and the Habsburgs, who were growing to be one of the most powerful royal families in Europe. After Albert had purchased the Duchy of Carinthia with the Carniolan and Windic marches, he did not need allies anymore. Joanna had children unusually late.

Pittsburgh Commission on Human Relations. On a professional basis, he did early work on the use of monitoring seismological vibrations to identify deposits of natural gas that became industry standards. Early life and education Gardner was born on March 2, 1926, in Tullamore, Ireland, and attended Trinity College in Dublin, where he majored in physics and mathematics, graduating in 1948. He moved to the United States, earning a masters in 1949 in applied mathematics at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (later known as Carnegie Mellon University) in 1949 and a Ph.D. at Princeton University in mathematical physics in 1953.Weber, Bruce. \\"Gerald Gardner, 83, Dies; Bolstered Sex Bias Suit\\", The New York Times, July 28, 2009.

Professional career He was hired by Gulf Oil in 1956 at a subsidiary that searched for deposits of oil and natural gas, where he developed techniques in applied seismology. Gardner also served on the faculty at the Carnegie Institute of Technology, Rice University and the University of Houston. He worked for more than two decades for the Gulf Research and Development Company, a subsidiary of Gulf Oil, contributing to significant advances in applied seismology, or methods for finding oil and natural gas deposits. Social activism Gardner was what his wife later described as \\"an activist atheist\\" and he was more comfortable working in the grassroots as a social activist than in front of a classroom. He and his wife belonged to First Pittsburgh NOW, the local chapter of the National Organization for Women, and he eventually served as the chapter's president. Wilma Scott Heide of First Pittsburgh took issue with the practice of the Pittsburgh Press of identifying the paper's help wanted jobs as male or female, and filed a complaint in 1969 with the Pittsburgh Commission on Human Relations claiming that this constituted discrimination against women. The Commission on Human Relations held a hearing in January 1970 and Gardner was one of the witnesses called, testifying that there were 1,000 column inches for \\"Jobs-Male Interest\\", 400 for female and 100 for male-female ads.Staff. \\"Press Denies Classified Ad Sex Bias\\", Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, January 16, 1970.

The local commission upheld the complaint, which included statistical evidence gathered by Gardner that showed the unlikelihood of a woman obtaining a job designated for men and described pay differentials between positions designated by gender that \\"flabbergasted\\" him. Former NOW president Eleanor Smeal described how Gardner's evidence was \\"hard intellectual theory based on the math\\" that \\"made it understandable, powerfully so.\\" The newspaper appealed its case to the Supreme Court of the United States, claiming that it was deprived of its rights to freedom of the press guaranteed under the First Amendment.

He was involved in another lawsuit in 1975, in which the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police was sued by the NAACP and NOW, which claimed that the department had discriminated in hiring women, African Americans and other minorities by the department. In a consent decree in place for 15 years, the department agreed to hire in groups of four that would include a white man, a white woman, a black man and a black woman. Until the decree was overturned following a lawsuit alleging reverse discrimination, the Police Bureau had the highest percentages of female and African-American police officers nationwide. He also supplied statistical analysis for cases against discount store G. C. Murphy and Kroger supermarkets, calculating the wages that female employees there lost as a result of gender-based discrimination, showing that small differences in pay between men and women when they were hired added up to substantial sums over the period of their employment, by affecting salary increases and opportunities for promotion.

UN Special Representative on Violence against Children=SRSG Mandate= The Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children is an independent global advocate for the prevention and elimination of all forms of violence against children. Appointed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations in follow up to the UN Study on Violence against Children, she acts as a bridge builder and a catalyst of actions in all regions and in all settings where violence may occur. By mobilizing action and political support, she aims at maintaining momentum around this agenda and generates renewed concern at the harmful effects of violence on children; to promote behavioral and social change, and to achieve effective progress. The mandate of the SRSG on Violence against Children is anchored in human rights standards, and promotes the universal ratification and effective implementation of core international conventions. The SRSG is particularly committed to pursuing three critical goals: the development in each country of a national strategy to prevent and respond to all forms of violence; the introduction of national legislation to prohibit all violence against children; and the consolidation of data and research to break the invisibility of violence and inform child sensitive policy and action. =SRSG Mandate Background= In 2001, United Nations General Assembly Resolution A/56/138 \\"Resolution A/RES/56/138\\" requested the Secretary General to conduct an in- depth study on the question of violence against children, following a recommendation of the Committee on the Rights of the Child. The UN Secretary General‚Äôs Study on Violence against Children (A/61/299),\\"Resolution A/RES/56/138\\" led by Professor Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, addressed violence against children in five settings: the family, schools, alternative care institutions and detention facilities, places where children work and communities. The Study called for urgent action to prevent and respond to all forms of violence and presented a set of recommendations as guidance. To promote dissemination of the Study and ensure effective follow up to its recommendations, the Study called for the appointment of a Special Representative of the Secretary General on Violence against Children (SRSG). On 1 May 2009, the Secretary General announced the appointment of Marta Santos Pais (Portugal) as his Special Representative on Violence against Children. Marta Santos Pais took her position on September 1, 2009. She was followed by The SRSG reports directly to the UN Secretary General,\\"SRSG Annual Report to the UN General Assembly 9 August 2010\\"\\"SRSG Annual Report to the Human Rights Council 28 February 2011\\"\\"SRSG Annual Report to the UN General Assembly 2 August 2011\\"\\"SRSG Annual Report to the Human Rights Council 13 January 2012\\"\\"SRSG Annual Report to the UN General Assembly 3 August 2012\\"\\"SRSG Annual Report to the Human Rights Council 4 January 2013\\"\\"SRSG Annual Report to the UN General Assembly 6 August 2013\\"\\"SRSG Annual Report to the Human Rights Council 3 January 2014\\"\\"SRSG Annual Report to the UN General Assembly 6 August 2014\\" chairs the United Nations Inter Agency Working Group on Violence against Children and collaborates closely with a wide range of partners, within and beyond the UN system. The SRSG and her office are funded from voluntary contributions. The mandate was first established for a period of three years. In November 2012, the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly approved by consensus the omnibus resolution on the promotion and protection of the rights of children A/67/152.\\"Resolution A/RES/56/138\\" The resolution recommended that the Secretary-General extend the mandate of the Special Representative on Violence against Children for a further period of three years and decided that \\"for the effective performance of the mandate and the sustainability of the core activities the mandate of the SRSG shall be funded from the regular budget starting at the biennium 2014-2015\\". The Office of the Special Representative is located in New York and provided with administrative support by the United Nations Children‚Äôs Fund (UNICEF). UNICEF has established a Trust Account in order to facilitate financial contributions in support of the mandate. =Violence against Children= Violence cuts across all cultures and knows no social, economic or geographic borders compromising the life of millions of children around the world and is associated with profound social costs. Available research leads to believe that between 500 million and 1.5 billion children worldwide endure some form of violence every year. Violence takes place in all contexts, including where children are expected to enjoy a secure environment and special protection - in care institutions, in the school and also within the home. Violence against children has dramatic and serious consequences, reducing human capacity and compromising social development. And yet, it remains hidden and socially condoned. Widely perceived as a social taboo or a needed form of discipline, it is seldom reported; official statistics remain limited in their ability to capture the true scale and extent of this phenomenon; and, openly or implicitly, children feel pressed to conceal incidents of violence and abuse, particularly when perpetrated by people they know and trust. A culture of silence, secrecy and social indifference surrounds this phenomenon, paving the way to pervasive impunity. Violence hampers children‚Äôs development and leaves a long lasting impact. But, as confirmed by many successful initiatives promoted in all regions of the world, violence is not inevitable; it can be prevented and effectively addressed. Around the globe, political commitments and law reform for children‚Äôs protection from violence is gaining momentum and becoming a priority in the national agenda of several States. Currently, 39 countries have introduced a comprehensive legal ban prohibiting violence in all settings, including corporal punishment in the home. In all regions, new legislative reform initiatives are currently under way to achieve full prohibition and in several countries new legislation is also under review to prohibit violence in specific settings. The legislative process has provided unique opportunities for sensitize the stakeholders and to involve community and religious leaders, parliamentarians, professional associations, academic institutions and grass-roots organizations, and engage communities concerned to promote change from within and consolidate prevention. Across regions significant commitments have also been undertaken to place the protection of children high in the policy agenda. The formation of the South Asia Initiative to Eliminate Violence against Children (SAIEVAC) with its five-year strategic plan to address violence against children; the Pan American Congress on the Child, the strategy of the Council of Europe to prevent and eliminate violence; the adoption of the Marrakesh Declaration by the League of Arab States, in December 2010, and the Beijing Declaration by the High-Level Meeting on South-South Cooperation on Child Rights in Asia and the Pacific are key milestones in this process. =SRSG Field Missions= Since being appointed in September 2009, Santos Pais has completed 157 field missions in the following countries (63): * Argentina * Austria * Belgium * Belize * Bolivia (Plurinational State of) * Brazil * Bulgaria * Cambodia * Chile * China * Costa Rica * Croatia * Denmark * Dominican Republic * Egypt * El Salvador * Ethiopia * Fiji * Finland * France * Germany * Ghana * Honduras * India * Indonesia * Ireland * Italy * Jamaica * Japan * Lao People's Democratic Republic * Lebanon * Malawi * Maldives * Morocco * Nepal * The Netherlands * Nicaragua * Nigeria * Norway * Panama * Paraguay * Peru * Philippines * Poland * Portugal * Qatar * Russia * Slovenia * Solomon Islands * Spain * Sri-Lanka * Sweden * Switzerland * Tanzania * Thailand * Turkey * United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland * United Republic of Tanzania * Ukraine * Uruguay * United States of America * Viet Nam Other activities * Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children, Member of the Board (since 2016)Board Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children. * International Journal of Children‚Äôs Rights, Member of the Editorial Advisory Board * International Inter-disciplinary Course on Children‚Äôs Rights, Member of the Advisory Board Personal life Marta Santos Pais is married and mother of two children.

Disney's versions of the characters are drawn in a more humorous and cartoony style than the illustrations in Harris's books. Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear (also spelled Brer Fox and Brer Bear, ) are fictional characters from African-American oral traditions popular in the Southern United States. This character has been recorded by many different folklorist but well known from the Uncle Remus folktales adapted and compiled by Joel Chandler Harris. The cult film Coonskin, directed by Ralph Bakshi, focuses on a trio of characters inspired by the original folktales. Br'er Rabbit, Br'er Bear and Br'er Fox (renamed \\"Preacher Fox\\" in the film) all appear, and the elements of the stories are moved to a then-contemporary urban setting. Disney Adaptions In the animated sequences of the 1946 Walt Disney-produced film Song of the South like in the tales, Brer Fox is the stories' antagonist, while Brer Bear is his dim-witted henchman. Brer Fox was voiced by actor James Baskett, who also portrayed the live-action character Uncle Remus. In contrast to the earlier illustrations of Frederick S. Church, A. B. Frost, and E. W. Kemble, the Disney animators depict the characters in a more slapstick, cartoony style.Brasch, Walter M. (2000).

He is officially styled, though, as II bishop of Indiana since missionary bishop Jackson Kemper is styled I bishop of Indiana. Early life Upfold was born in Shenely Green, Surrey, England, and emigrated to the United States with his parents at the age of six.Lossing, 476 The family settled in Albany, New York.Johnson, 246 He earned his bachelor's degree from Union College in 1814. Initially intending to enter the medical profession, he earned a medical doctorate from the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City in 1816. Two years later, Upfold abandoned his medical career took up theology. He was assigned to be deacon at Trinity Church in Lansingburg, New York in October 1818. While there, he was ordained a priest on July 13, 1820. He was appointed rector of Church of St. Luke in the Fields, New York, about 1823. Upfold was then elected rector of St. Thomas's Church, New York, until 1831 when he moved to Pennsylvania to become the rector of Trinity Church in Pittsburgh. He remained at Trinity until 1849. Bishop of Indiana In December 1849, Upfold was elected Bishop of Indiana. He was the 50th bishop in the ECUSA, and was consecrated on December 16, 1849 by Bishops Benjamin Bosworth Smith, Charles Pettit McIlvaine, and Jackson Kemper. While bishop, Upfold also served as rector for St. John's Church in Lafayette, Indiana and Christ Church Cathedral in Indianapolis. By 1855, the Diocese of Indiana had built is status and stability to the point that it could financially support the office of bishop, allowing Upfold to concentrate only on his duties as bishop. Upfold received a LL.D. degree from the Western University of Pennsylvania in 1856. In 1857 he moved the seat of the Diocese to Indianapolis where he remained in office until 1872. He served as the sole bishop until 1865 when, crippled by gout, he arranged for the election of a coadjutor bishop. He died in 1872 and is buried at Crown Hill Cemetery, Indianapolis.

Both schools are members of the Atlantic Coast Conference. Since conference expansion in 2005, Clemson represents the Atlantic Division while Georgia Tech plays in the Coastal Division, and they are official cross-divisional rivals which play every year. Clemson won the first four games of the rivalry, but Georgia Tech leads the all-time series 51‚Äì32‚Äì2. There have been two lengthy win streaks, as the Yellow Jackets went 15‚Äì0 against Clemson from 1908 to 1934 and 10‚Äì0 against Clemson from 1953 to 1968. Football legend John Heisman coached both teams and went undefeated in the rivalry. Heisman coached (and won) two games for Clemson against Georgia Tech before switching sides and going 12‚Äì0‚Äì1 for Georgia Tech against Clemson. From 1902 to 1973, all games were played in Atlanta near the campus of Georgia Tech. The home-and-home ACC series has been hotly contested at 21‚Äì17 (in favor of Clemson) since it began in 1983. The rivalry was played twice in a single year when Georgia Tech defeated Clemson in September 2009 and repeated the feat when they faced off again in the 2009 ACC Championship Game three months later. The rivals have seen large and similar amounts of high-level success, as Georgia Tech claims four national championships (1917, 1928, 1954, 1990) and Clemson three (1981, 2016, 2018). Moreover, Georgia Tech (25‚Äì19) and Clemson (24‚Äì20) have each played in 44 bowl games, while Clemson and Georgia Tech have 744 and 735 all-time wins, respectively, as of the conclusion of the 2018 season.Winsipedia: Clemson vs. Georgia Tech By the Numbers, accessed May 18, 2018 These two ACC members also coincidentally have more of a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics focus than their sibling flagship university state schools from the SEC -- with which they also have intense rivalries: Georgia Tech's Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate rivalry with the Georgia Bulldogs, and Clemson's Palmetto Bowl game against the South Carolina Gamecocks. Series history The teams take the field at the 2007 Clemson‚ÄìGeorgia Tech game at Bobby Dodd Stadium Through 2019, the teams have played 85 times, with Tech leading the series 50‚Äì32‚Äì2, with 60 games played in Atlanta, and only 20 games played in Clemson's Memorial Stadium. The teams first met in 1898, when Clemson's third- year program defeated Georgia Tech 23‚Äì0 to finish with a 3‚Äì1 record. The following year, the Tigers beat Tech again, 41‚Äì5. In 1904, Georgia Tech lured away Clemson's head coach, John Heisman (namesake of the Heisman Trophy), with the prospect of $450 pay raise ($ adjusted for inflation), which was a 25% salary increase. In 1977, Georgia Tech, a year before it joined the ACC, decided to end its series with Clemson. George Bennett, a Clemson athletics booster, was determined to preserve the game, as the trip to Atlanta provided a unique experience for the Tigers players and fanbase who had not been to a bowl game since 1959. In what was supposed to be the final game in Atlanta, upon Bennett's suggestion, thousands of Clemson supporters paid their expenses with two-dollar bills stamped with the shape of a tiger paw. This demonstrated the large amount of money that the Clemson fanbase regularly pumped into the local economy because of the game. The series resumed in 1983 when Georgia Tech began playing football in the ACC. This has become one of the most competitive rivalries in the ACC with a record of 17-16, with Clemson currently leading the series by one game (excluding the vacated 2009 ACC Championship Game won by Tech). These games have often been decided at the last minute and by small margins. Nine of the games between 1996 and 2006 were decided by five points or less. When the Atlantic Coast Conference- ACC- reorganized in 2005 to form divisions for the sport of football, Clemson and Georgia Tech were designated as cross-division rivals.Atlantic Coast Conference Football Divisional Tiebreaker , Atlantic Coast Conference, August 21, 2005. This means that their football teams meet every season, unlike games between each team's other non-divisional conference opponents, which are played less often on a rotational basis. In the 2009 season, both teams won their respective division in the ACC. For the first time in the series' history, the two teams met for a second time in a season on December 5, 2009 in the ACC Championship Game. The game marked the first ever December meeting between the two teams, as well as the first post-season meeting. It was also the first time the series has been played outside of Atlanta or Clemson since 1899. Georgia Tech won 39‚Äì34; however, the NCAA later vacated the last 3 games of Georgia Tech's 2009 season along with the ACC Championship. The NCAA determined that starting WR Demaryius Thomas should have been ruled ineligible ahead of the previous game for accepting $312 worth of clothing from a potential agent. While the offense was minor, and the individual never proven to be an agent and the clothing returned, the NCAA ruled that Georgia Tech's athletic department had prepared the players prior to submitting statements, and was generally uncooperative with the NCAA investigation. Therefore, all games following the alleged offense have been vacated, including the 2009 ACC championship game with Clemson. In the 2011 season, both teams started 6‚Äì0. Clemson had beaten previous national champion Auburn earlier in the season, and the match-up was highly anticipated until Georgia Tech stumbled losing two straight games, at Virginia and at Miami (FL). Clemson's Andre Ellington was injured, and after 4 Clemson turnovers, Georgia Tech went on to upset the #5 Tigers 31-17. Both teams went on to lose three games toward the end of the season, with the exception of Clemson's dominating performance over Coastal Division champion #5 Virginia Tech to clinch the 2011 ACC Championship.

It was put \\"on hold\\", but not quite abolished, prior to the 2013 barangay elections. In January 2016, the Sangguniang Kabataan Reform Act was signed into law which made some significant changes to the SK and initially scheduled new elections for October 2016. In March 2017, the elections were postponed anew to May 2018. The SK Chairman leads the Sangguniang Kabataan. A Local Youth Development Council (LYDC) composed of representatives of different local youth groups supports the SK and its programs. The Sangguniang Kabataan is the successor of the KB or the Kabataang Barangay () which was abolished by the Local Government Code of 1991. The author, Senator Aquilino Pimentel Jr. abolished KB because of allegations that this organization faced. Function and structure The Kagawads, or councilors, approve resolutions and appropriate money allotted to the council. The Chairman automatically sits on the barangay council as an ex officio member and is automatically chairman of the Committee on Youth and Sports, one of the standing committees of the barangay council. The council represents youth who have resided in their barangay for at least one year and registered to vote. It leads the local youth programs. Members of the SK receive payment for serving on the council. Under the Local Government Code, only the SK Chairman receives money but in some areas the practice was that the chairman shares his payment with other members of the SK council. In one barangay, each SK member received 500 pesos per month from the chairman. =Local Youth Development Council= Under the 2016 reform, a new Local Youth Development Council was formed to support the SK programs and to be composed of representatives from different youth organizations in the community including student councils, church and youth faith groups, youth-serving organizations, and community-based youth groups. \\"The LYDC aims to harmonize, broaden and strengthen all programs and initiatives of the local government and non-governmental organizations for the youth sector,\\" said Senator Bam Aquino, then chairman of the Senate Committee on Youth and co-author of the reform act. =SK Federations= Every Sangguniang Kabataan is part of a municipal or city SK association, which are in turn members of a provincial SK association. A barangay's SK Chairman represents the barangay in the municipal or city association. The presidents of the city and municipal federation are, in turn, members of the provincial or metropolitan associations, all of which have their own elected president as well. The presidents of independent cities' and provinces' associations compose the membership in the national association and elect the national president who automatically sits on the National Youth Commission. History=Predecessors= The SK developed out of the Kabataang Barangay, established during martial law by President Ferdinand Marcos. Marcos established the KB in 1975 to give youth a chance to be involved in community affairs and to provide the government means to inform youth of the government's development efforts. His daughter Imee Marcos was chairman. Controversy surrounded the KB, including the enforcement of authoritarian rule among youth, opposition of militant youth activity, and the KB's failure to develop youth as a responsive collective. Since then, the KB grew less popular among youth and instead student activism became the trend in youth participation in the country. In June 1986, a study was conducted on the KB and came up with the following recommendations: abolish the KB; create a National Youth Commission (NYC); establish a National Youth Assembly; and set up genuine youth representation in government. Youth consultations were held, and the KB was abolished by the government. However, then-president Corazon Aquino have already established the Presidential Council for Youth Affairs (PCYA) instead of NYC, which was successful in coordinating with the youth federations to develop future national leaders, but lacked the powers envisioned for the NYC because PCYA merely coordinated with youth groups. A proposal was then crafted by the Congress youth representatives and PCYA's technical committee in 1989 to 1990. The proposal that created the Katipunan ng Kabataan (KK) and Sangguniang Kabataan (SK) was incorporated into the 1991 Local Government Code (known as Local Autonomy Act or Republic Act 7160). It formally abolished the KB and created the KK and SK. The KK includes all Filipino citizens, age 10 to 18 years, residing in each barangay for at least six months and are registered in the official barangay list. The SK is the governing body of the KK, a set of youth leaders elected by the KK members to represent them and deliver youth-focused services in the barangay. The age range of the youth eligible for the KK and SK was reduced to 15 to below 18 due to the change in Republic Act 9164 in 2002. =Sangguniang Kabataan reform= Infographic from the National Youth Council of the changes made by the Sangguniang Kabataan Reform Act. SKs developed a poor reputation. One youth advocate said he was dissuaded from running for an SK because \\"Aside from the lack of concrete legislative and youth development programs, I have heard of certain issues raised against the SK like corruption, nepotism, and recurring programs focusing on sports festivals and pageantry only.\\" A 2007 study by UNICEF and the Department of Interior and Local Government said, ‚ÄúThe SK‚Äôs performance for the past ten years has been generally weak. This is especially true in terms of coming up with legislations, promoting the development of young people, submitting reports and holding consultations with their constituents.‚Äù‚ÄúThe Impact of Youth Participation in the Local Government Process: The Sangguniang Kabataan Experience\\" quoted in Charles Ladia's Rappler article. See citation above. Because of concerns that the SK is a \\"breeding ground for political dynasty and exposing the youth to corruption and the practice of traditional politicians\\" known colloquially as trapos, Republic Act No. 10632 was enacted in 2013 to (a) postpone the scheduled October 2013 SK elections until some time between October 28, 2014 and February 23, 2015 and (b) leave vacant all the SK positions until new officers are elected. The bill explicitly prohibits the appointing of officials to fill the vacant positions. Sen. Francis Escudero said the vacancies would technically abolish the SK. During this time, the Commission on Elections (Comelec) and the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) issued regulations on how the barangays are to use the 10% of Internal Revenue Allotment set aside for SK activities and mandating the creation in each barangay a \\"Task Force on Youth Development\\". In the place of SKs, ad hoc youth committees were formed. In January 2015, as the February 23 deadline approached for the date of the postponed elections, the Philippine House of Representatives unanimously passed a reform bill. Among the reforms are the raising of the age of SK officials from between 15 and 17 years old to between 18 and 21; the raising of the age of voters from between 15 and 17 to between 15 and 21; an anti-dynasty provision that forbids candidates from having a relative in public office that is within the second degree of affinity; and provisions to increase SKs' fiscal autonomy. Immediately after passing the reform bill, the Philippine House passed a bill further postponing the SK elections from February 2015 to October 2016 to be held at the same time as the barangay elections of 2016. In March 2015, a law postponing the elections to 2016 was signed by President Aquino. However, the elections were eventually held in May 2018. On January 15, 2016, the Sangguniang Kabataan Reform Act (Republic Act No. 10742) was signed into law which made some significant changes to the SK. It changed the age of the council from 15 to 17 years old to 18 to 24 years old and it forbids individuals from seeking a youth council appointment who are closer than the second degree of consanguinity (have the same grandparents) from any elected or appointed official in the same area. It is the first Philippine law with an anti-political dynasty restriction for elected positions, as permitted by the 1987 Philippine Constitution. The reform also created a Local Youth Development Council to support the SK programs composed of representatives from different youth organizations in the community including student councils, church and youth faith groups, youth- serving organizations, and community-based youth groups. SK Elections Since 1992, there have been three simultaneous nationwide SK elections held in the Philippines which each term lasting from three to five years due to amendment of the regular 3-year term of the council. Except in 1992 and 1996 elections, Sangguniang Kabataan elections have been synchronized with the Barangay election starting in 2002, and in 2007. The term limit for Sangguniang Kabataan officials is usually three years but since the first election, there have been extension of terms ranging from one to two years more in office. * 1992 Philippine Sangguniang Kabataan election on December 4, 1992 * 1996 Philippine Sangguniang Kabataan election on May 6, 1996 * 2002 Philippine barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan elections on July 15, 2002 * 2007 Philippine barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan elections on October 29, 2007 * 2010 Philippine barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan elections on October 25, 2010 * 2018 Philippine barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan elections on May 14, 2018 See also *Youth council *Youth politics ReferencesExternal links * Sangguniang Kabataan (SK) Constitution and By-Laws * Sangguniang Kabataan Reform Act on Gov.ph Katipunan ng Kabataan Youth councils Barangays of the Philippines Legislatures of the Philippines Local government in the Philippines Tagalog words and phrases ","title":"Sangguniang Kabataan"},{"id":"23792290","text":"The 1995 Dutch Open was an ATP men's tennis tournament held in Amsterdam, Netherlands, after being transferred from Hilversum, and played on outdoor clay courts.

These times of year allow for the optimization of survival of young due to factors such as ambient temperature, food and water availability, and changes in the predation behaviors of other species. Related sexual interest and behaviors are expressed and accepted only during this period. Female seasonal breeders will have one or more estrus cycles only when she is \\"in season\\" or fertile and receptive to mating. At other times of the year, they will be anestrus, or have a dearth of their sexual cycle. Unlike reproductive cyclicity, seasonality is described in both males and females. Male seasonal breeders may exhibit changes in testosterone levels, testes weight, and fertility depending on the time of year. Seasonal breeders are distinct from opportunistic breeders, that mate whenever the conditions of their environment become favorable, and continuous breeders that mate year- round. Timing of seasonal breeding The breeding season is when seasonal breeders reproduce. Various variables can affect when it occurs. A primary influence on the timing of reproduction is food availability. Organisms generally time especially stressing events of reproduction to occur in sync with increases in food availability. This is not always true, however, both because of the importance of other factors and the invalidation of this generalization. For example, in species reproducing at high latitudes, food availability before breeding is more important than availability during reproduction itself. Other factors can also be responsible. For example, species that are preyed upon frequently may time reproduction to occur out of sync with the peak in density of predators. Physiology The hypothalamus is considered to be the central control for reproduction due to its role in hormone regulation. Hence, factors that determine when a seasonal breeder will be ready for mating affect this tissue. This is achieved specifically through changes in the production of the hormone GnRH. GnRH in turn transits to the pituitary where it promotes the secretion of the gonadotropins LH and FSH, both pituitary hormones critical for reproductive function and behavior, into the bloodstream. Changes in gonadotropin secretion initiate the end of anestrus in females. =Day length= Seasonal breeding readiness is strongly regulated by length of day (photoperiod) and thus season. Photoperiod likely affects the seasonal breeder through changes in melatonin secretion by the pineal gland that ultimately alter GnRH release by the hypothalamus. Hence, seasonal breeders can be divided into groups based on fertility period. \\"Long day\\" breeders cycle when days get longer (spring) and are in anestrus in fall and winter. Some animals that are long day breeders include; ring-tailed lemurs, horses, hamsters, groundhogs, and mink. \\"Short day\\" breeders cycle when the length of daylight shortens (fall) and are in anestrus in spring and summer. The decreased light during the fall decreases the firing of the retinal nerves, in turn decreasing the excitation of the superior cervical ganglion, which then decreases the inhibition of the pineal gland, finally resulting in an increase in melatonin. This increase in melatonin results in an increase in GnRH and subsequently an increase in the hormones LH and FSH, which stimulate cyclicity.

The first recording about it was done by Marco Polo, somewhere in the wastelands of northern Persia. According to Polo, it was the only tree within hundreds of kilometres of desert. The legend said that the Dry Tree marked the exact spot of the great battle between Alexander the Great and Darius. It is not clear whether this 'great battle' refers to the battle of Issus or of Gaugamela, or both. The purported location‚Äîsomewhere in Khorasan, near the border with present day Turkmenistan‚Äîis also impossible to ascertain, because Darius had already been assassinated when Alexander reached these regions. Overview Polo describes the Dry Tree as large tree with green leaves on one side and white leaves on the other. For that reason, the Dry tree should be a platanus. A solitary dry tree is also visible on the Issus-mosaic from Pompeii, showing the location where Alexander and Darius came face to face. The Dry Tree has been reported later by the Bavarian adventurer Johannes Schiltberger, who compared it to the Oak of Mamre. He said that Muslims called this tree \\"Kurrutherek\\" or \\"Sirpe\\". This last word is close to the Turco-Persian word meaning \\"cyperus\\". The Spanish ambassador Clavijo said that the tree was in Tabriz. Although the story is a legend, solitary trees do exist. The Tree of T√©n√©r√© was a such an isolated tree in the West-African state of Niger, serving both as a landmark and a national monument. The nearest tree to it was 400 km away.

The multivariate mutual information is represented by gray region. Since it may be negative, the areas on the diagram represent signed measures. In information theory there have been various attempts over the years to extend the definition of mutual information to more than two random variables. The expression and study of multivariate higher-degree mutual- information was achieved in two seemingly independent works: McGill (1954) who called these functions ‚Äúinteraction information‚Äù, and Hu Kuo Ting (1962) who also first proved the possible negativity of mutual-information for degrees higher than 2 and justified algebraically the intuitive correspondence to Venn diagrams . Definition The conditional mutual information can be used to inductively define a multivariate mutual information (MMI) in a set- or measure-theoretic sense in the context of information diagrams. In this sense we define the multivariate mutual information as follows: :I(X_1;\\\\ldots;X_{n+1}) = I(X_1;\\\\ldots;X_n) - I(X_1;\\\\ldots;X_nX_{n+1}), where :I(X_1;\\\\ldots;X_nX_{n+1}) = \\\\mathbb{E}_{X_{n+1}} [D_{\\\\mathrm{KL}}( P_{(X_1,\\\\ldots,X_n)X_{n+1}} \\\\ P_{X_1X_{n+1}} \\\\otimes\\\\cdots\\\\otimes P_{X_nX_{n+1}} )]. This definition is identical to that of interaction information except for a change in sign in the case of an odd number of random variables. Alternatively, the multivariate mutual information may be defined in measure-theoretic terms as the intersection of the individual entropies \\\\mu(\\\\tilde{X}_i): : I(X_1;X_2;...;X_{n+1})=\\\\mu\\\\left(\\\\bigcap_{i=1}^{n+1}\\\\tilde{X}_i\\\\right) Defining \\\\tilde{Y}=\\\\bigcap_{i=1}^n\\\\tilde{X}_i, the set-theoretic identity \\\\tilde{A}=(\\\\tilde{A}\\\\cap\\\\tilde{B})\\\\cup(\\\\tilde{A}\\\\backslash\\\\tilde{B}) which corresponds to the measure-theoretic statement \\\\mu(\\\\tilde{A})=\\\\mu(\\\\tilde{A}\\\\cap \\\\tilde{B})+\\\\mu(\\\\tilde{A}\\\\backslash\\\\tilde{B}), allows the above to be rewritten as: : I(X_1;X_2;...;X_{n+1})=\\\\mu(\\\\tilde{Y}\\\\cap\\\\tilde{X}_{n+1})=\\\\mu(\\\\tilde{Y})-\\\\mu(\\\\tilde{Y}\\\\backslash\\\\tilde{X}_{n+1}) which is identical to the first definition. Properties Multi-variate information and conditional multi-variate information can be decomposed into a sum of entropies. : I(X_1;\\\\ldots;X_n) = -\\\\sum_{ T \\\\subseteq \\\\\\\\{1,\\\\ldots,n\\\\\\\\} }(-1)^{T}H(T) : I(X_1;\\\\ldots;X_nY) = -\\\\sum_{T \\\\subseteq \\\\\\\\{1,\\\\ldots,n\\\\\\\\} } (-1)^{T} H(TY) Multivariate statistical independence  The multivariate mutual-information functions generalize the pairwise independence case that states that X_1,X_2 if and only if I(X_1;X_2)=0, to arbitrary numerous variable. n variables are mutually independent if and only if the 2^n-n-1 mutual information functions vanish I(X_1;...;X_k)=0 with n \\\\ge k \\\\ge 2 (theorem 2 ). In this sense, the I(X_1;...;X_k)=0 can be used as a refined statistical independence criterion.  Synergy and redundancy  The multivariate mutual information may be positive, negative or zero. The positivity corresponds to relations generalizing the pairwise correlations, nullity corresponds to a refined notion of independence, and negativity detects high dimensional \\"emergent\\" relations and clusterized datapoints ). For the simplest case of three variables X, Y, and Z, knowing, say, X yields a certain amount of information about Z. This information is just the mutual information I(X;Z) (yellow and gray in the Venn diagram above). Likewise, knowing Y will also yield a certain amount of information about Z, that being the mutual information I(Y;Z) (cyan and gray in the Venn diagram above). The amount of information about Z which is yielded by knowing both X and Y together is the information that is mutual to Z and the X,Y pair, written I(X,Y;Z) (yellow, gray and cyan in the Venn diagram above) and it may be greater than, equal to, or less than the sum of the two mutual information, this difference being the multivariate mutual information: I(X;Y;Z)=I(Y;Z)+I(X;Z)-I(X,Y;Z). In the case where the sum of the two mutual information is greater than I(X,Y;Z), the multivariate mutual information will be positive. In this case, some of the information about Z provided by knowing X is also provided by knowing Y, causing their sum to be greater than the information about Z from knowing both together. That is to say, there is a \\"redundancy\\" in the information about Z provided by the X and Y variables. In the case where the sum of the mutual information is less than I(X,Y;Z), the multivariate mutual information will be negative. In this case, knowing both X and Y together provides more information about Z than the sum of the information yielded by knowing either one alone. That is to say, there is a \\"synergy\\" in the information about Z provided by the X and Y variables. The above explanation is intended to give an intuitive understanding of the multivariate mutual information, but it obscures the fact that it does not depend upon which variable is the subject (e.g., Z in the above example) and which other two are being thought of as the source of information. For 3 variables, Brenner et al. applied multivariate mutual information to neural coding and called its negativity \\"synergy\\" and Watkinson et al. applied it to genetic expression =Example of positive multivariate mutual information (redundancy) = Positive MMI is typical of common-cause structures. For example, clouds cause rain and also block the sun; therefore, the correlation between rain and darkness is partly accounted for by the presence of clouds, I(\\\\text{rain};\\\\text{dark}\\\\text{cloud}) \\\\leq I(\\\\text{rain};\\\\text{dark}). The result is positive MMI I(\\\\text{rain};\\\\text{dark};\\\\text{cloud}). = Examples of negative multivariate mutual information (synergy) = rightThe case of negative MMI is infamously non-intuitive. A prototypical example of negative I(X;Y;Z) has X as the output of an XOR gate to which Y and Z are the independent random inputs. In this case I(Y;Z) will be zero, but I(Y;ZX) will be positive (1 bit) since once output X is known, the value on input Y completely determines the value on input Z. Since I(Y;ZX)>I(Y;Z), the result is negative MMI I(X;Y;Z). It may seem that this example relies on a peculiar ordering of X,Y,Z to obtain the positive interaction, but the symmetry of the definition for I(X;Y;Z) indicates that the same positive interaction information results regardless of which variable we consider as the interloper or conditioning variable. For example, input Y and output X are also independent until input Z is fixed, at which time they are totally dependent. rightThis situation is an instance where fixing the common effect X of causes Y and Z induces a dependency among the causes that did not formerly exist. This behavior is colloquially referred to as explaining away and is thoroughly discussed in the Bayesian Network literature (e.g., Pearl 1988). Pearl's example is auto diagnostics: A car's engine can fail to start (X) due either to a dead battery (Y) or due to a blocked fuel pump (Z). Ordinarily, we assume that battery death and fuel pump blockage are independent events, because of the essential modularity of such automotive systems. Thus, in the absence of other information, knowing whether or not the battery is dead gives us no information about whether or not the fuel pump is blocked. However, if we happen to know that the car fails to start (i.e., we fix common effect X), this information induces a dependency between the two causes battery death and fuel blockage. Thus, knowing that the car fails to start, if an inspection shows the battery to be in good health, we conclude the fuel pump is blocked. Battery death and fuel blockage are thus dependent, conditional on their common effect car starting. The obvious directionality in the common-effect graph belies a deep informational symmetry: If conditioning on a common effect increases the dependency between its two parent causes, then conditioning on one of the causes must create the same increase in dependency between the second cause and the common effect. In Pearl's automotive example, if conditioning on car starts induces I(X;Y;Z) bits of dependency between the two causes battery dead and fuel blocked, then conditioning on fuel blocked must induce I(X;Y;Z) bits of dependency between battery dead and car starts. This may seem odd because battery dead and car starts are governed by the implication battery dead \\\\rightarrow car doesn't start. However, these variables are still not totally correlated because the converse is not true. Conditioning on fuel blocked removes the major alternate cause of failure to start, and strengthens the converse relation and therefore the association between battery dead and car starts. = Positivity for Markov Chains = If three variables form a Markov chain X\\\\to Y \\\\to Z, then I(X;Y,Z)=H(X)-H(XY,Z)=H(X)-H(XY)=I(X;Y), soI(X;Y;Z) = I(X;Y)-I(X;YZ) = I(X;Y,Z)-I(X;YZ)= I(X;Z) \\\\geq 0. Bounds The bounds for the 3-variable case are : -\\\\min\\\\ \\\\\\\\{ I(X;YZ), I(Y;ZX), I(X;ZY) \\\\\\\\} \\\\leq I(X;Y;Z) \\\\leq \\\\min\\\\ \\\\\\\\{ I(X;Y), I(Y;Z), I(X;Z) \\\\\\\\} Difficulties A complication is that this multivariate mutual information (as well as the interaction information) can be positive, negative, or zero, which makes this quantity difficult to interpret intuitively. In fact, for n random variables, there are 2^n-1 degrees of freedom for how they might be correlated in an information- theoretic sense, corresponding to each non-empty subset of these variables. These degrees of freedom are bounded by the various inequalities in information theory.

Early years Allmond was born on May 2, 1923 in Fannin County, Texas, near the town of Bailey. Her parents were Arthur M. Allmond and Lou Cole Allmond. The youngest of four children, she was raised on a cotton and corn farm. Though the family farmed for a living, they also performed music, and Allmond sang publicly for the first time at the age of four. She started playing country fiddle at a young age, borrowing a violin from her brother, Charles Raymond, and she practiced for long hours. Career Allmond started her career as a musician in 1940, touring Oklahoma and North Texas. She performed in one band with her brothers, Charles Raymond and James Roy, while displaying a novel bowing technique, which combined harmony and rhythm. Later in the decade she toured with fellow violinists, Georgia ‚ÄúSlim‚Äù Rutland and Howard ‚ÄúHowdy‚Äù Forrester. In the 1940s Ruby was playing in these shows with two very renowned fiddle players, Also during this time she was a part of a band that included her two brothers, Raymond and Roy Allmond, who played acoustic rhythm guitars, and Harold Carder, who played stand up bass. She eventually formed her own band, Texas Jamboree, which included Guy Bryant, his children Joyce and Gene Bryant, and Clay Harvey. In 1968, Audra Brock and Ruby decided to take some of Ruby's songs to Nashville. They sent a tape to Bob Jennings, the publisher at RCA. He invited them to a studio for a demo recording session. Ruby sang \\"Reno\\", which ended up being recorded by Dottie West and produced by Chet Atkins, was a hit, breaking the Top Ten on the country music charts. Atkins produced several of her songs, and even told Ruby that she was \\"a great songwriter\\". Besides writing songs to be recorded and produced by others, Ruby also wrote songs that were specifically for stage shows. Later on in her career Ruby participated in many local stage shows around the Bonham, Texas area to raise funds for the community. One song that was strongly requested was \\"Listen to The Mockingbird\\". The original arrangement came from back in her early fiddling days. She arranged the song in such a way as to highlight her extraordinary fiddle playing. Other crowd favorites like \\"Honky-Tonk Rock\\" and \\"Indian Rock\\" had obvious country music roots, but also influences from other genres. Before Ruby's death in January 2006, she and Brock had been working on assembling some of her songs into a collection. The songs were compiled into 2-CD sets, Today I'll Think About the Rain and A Little Home Cooking. The latter CD set, A Little Home Cooking, came about because the residents around Bonham requested a compilation of Ruby‚Äôs instrumental work. Audra promptly assembled an album of 22 instrumental songs played by Ruby on the fiddle and guitar.Ruby Allmond Collection Finding Aid, tamu-commerce.edu; accessed August 15, 2017.

Life Born in London in 1634 or 1635, he was the son of William Grove of Morden, Dorset. In 1645 he was sent to Winchester College, and was admitted a pensioner of St. John's College, Cambridge, on 18 October 1652. He was elected a scholar in 1653, graduated B.A. in 1657, and became a fellow on 23 March 1658. For several years he lived in college as tutor, proceeding M.A. in 1660, B.D. in 1667, and D.D. in 1681. Grove, on becoming chaplain to Humphrey Henchman, Bishop of London, was presented by him to the rectory of Wennington, Essex, on 21 February 1667, which he left before 27 January 1669. On 2 September 1669 he received from the crown the rectory of Langham, Essex and on 5 October following the rectory of Aldham, in the same county, from the bishop. These livings he resigned on obtaining from Henchman the wealthy rectory of St. Andrew Undershaft, London, on 18 February 1670. On 6 October 1679 he was made prebendary of Willesden in St. Paul's Cathedral. He took part in drawing up the famous petition against James II's declaration for liberty of conscience in May 1688. On 8 September 1690 he was appointed archdeacon of Middlesex, being also chaplain in ordinary to the king and queen. He was consecrated bishop of Chichester on 30 August 1691. He died from the effects of a carriage accident on 25 September 1696, aged 62. He was buried in Chichester Cathedral. He married Elizabeth Cole of Dover. Works He had verses in 'Academiae Cantabrigiensis œÉœéœÉœÑœÅŒ±,' 1660, and his 'Carmen de Sanguinis Circuitu a Gulielmo Harvaeo primum invento' was published with some miscellaneous poems in 1685.

This is in contrast to other conventional forms of representative democracy, such as the winner-take-all system, where the winner of a plurality of votes in a given district, party or other grouping of voters, goes on to represent all voters in that group, or the proportional representation system where the number of representatives allotted to each party or political faction is roughly in proportion to the number of voters supporting each faction. Direct representation is seen by its supporters as an optimal compromise between pure direct democracy and conventional representative democracy, as legislative decisions will more closely reflect the pure will of the people yet will still be carried out by a \\"wise\\", \\"experienced\\" or professional group of informed and accountable elected representatives. Because any voter can vote for any candidate in the land, direct representation is unaffected by any division into districts, and thus not susceptible to gerrymandering. Districts only serve a logistical purpose in organizing the elections. It also avoids disenfranchisement of large voter groups, that are only slightly in the minority, in cases where the electorate is split nearly evenly in its choice for representation, yet the preferred representative of only one faction must be chosen to represent the entire electorate of a party or district. Variants *Single Proxy Representation (SPxR) is a variant where an electoral district would elect a single representative by first past the post, who then votes in a legislature with the votes received during the election. While not providing the all advantages of full PxR/DR, SPxR would limit legislature size, reward inclusiveness, and blunts the effect of gerrymandering. SPxR has the advantage of being an easy to explain relatively minor change for a currently implemented non-proxy representative systems such as the US House of Representatives. The disadvantage of SPxR over full PxR/DR is lack of representation for political minority views. Benefits Supporters of direct representation cite the following benefits: * Unlike direct democracy, voters do not vote on legislation themselves but rather elect representatives to perform legislative duties on their behalf, thus reducing the amount of time and energy the average citizen has to spend thinking about and voting on specific legislation. * Unlike representation determined by plurality or majority vote, every voter in an election district has their vote represented in the legislature regardless of whether or not their choice won a plurality or majority of votes. * Unlike proportional representation, each voter votes for a specific representative to represent them, rather than a political party. This provides voters a wider range of nuance in political platforms to choose from, rather than simply having to choose between a relatively small number of \\"one-size-fits-all\\" parties. It also means that even the smallest interests can be heard. * Every vote is equal to every other vote. * States' and districts' political power is proportional to the number of their residents who vote. This is deemed more fair by some than representation by population because those in the population who cannot or choose not to vote do not subsequently lend their weight to those in the state or district who can and do. Hence a state with a high child-to-adult ratio will not give each voter more representational weight than a state with fewer children per adult, for example. The same is true for other residents who are ineligible to vote, such as non-citizen legal residents, illegal aliens, prisoners, and convicted felons. * Because the majority of voters in a district cannot be shut out of the process as in some plurality elections (where the winning candidate falls short of majority support), coalition-building among non-plurality-winners is possible and effective, both generally and on specific issues. Disadvantages * Unwieldy, suffers from scalability issues. In the USHR example below, the 435 current members are already considered cumbersome for debate, if each of those seats broke into three, 1,305 would cause logistical issues. This is a best case of only three parties, if it grew to unlimited parties it would quickly reach unreasonable numbers. * Increased burden on voters. While a minor disadvantage compared to the benefit of more accurate representation, DR puts greater pressure on voters to vote. In first past post systems many elections are ‚Äúpredetermined‚Äù by electorate demographics, many voters don‚Äôt vote knowing it won‚Äôt matter. * Greater likelihood of compulsory voting. Depending on opinion could be listed under benefits. If a politician‚Äôs power is dependent on the number of votes, they will work to maximize the number of voters. While voter inclusion is generally viewed as a noble goal, the obvious optimal solution is to remove people‚Äôs freedom not to participate. In a multi-state country, if one state implemented compulsory voting to increase their total, all the other states would be under significant pressure to follow the same tactic. Example Suppose there is a congressional district with 400,000 residents eligible to vote and three candidates running to represent it, A, B, and C. Further suppose that in the election, A receives 90,000 votes (45% of total), B receives 70,000 (35%), and C receives 40,000 (20%), with the remaining eligible voters declining to vote. Under the plurality voting system, such as that used to elect members of the United States House of Representatives, A would \\"win\\" the election and hence only A would be allowed to vote in the legislature, with the weight of a single vote. Under a direct representative system, A, B, and C would all be allowed to participate in and vote in the legislature, with each candidate being able to cast the number of votes equal to the number they received themselves in the election. Hence if B and C happen to agree on an issue that A disagrees with them on, with direct representation they can out-vote A on that issue (110,000 to 90,000) since they represent the choice of more voters in their district, whereas with representation determined by a plurality of voters, only A can cast a vote on the issue, while B and C, who together represent a majority of the electorate, are completely shut out from the legislature.

Funding for the Society was accumulated over a period of years through lotteries, among other sources. It was formally established by authority of an act of Parliament in 1773. Among its founders were Thomas McCabe and Waddell Cunningham. Some of the first recorded minutes of the Society noted that: 'a poor-house and hospital are greatly wanted in Belfast for the support of vast numbers of real objects of charity in this parish, for the employment of idle beggars who crowd to it from all parts of the North, and for the reception of infirm and diseased poor'. For a period in the 18th century, the Society was responsible for the supply of clean water in Belfast. It also helped to create Belfast's first hospital and a municipal burial ground.

Career  The Leiden Talmud was written in 1289 by rabbi Jehiel ben rabbi Jekuthiel ben rabbi Benjamin HaRofe. Jehiel lived in Rome during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries where he was a famous scholar, writer, poet (of Piyyutim/liturgical poetry), and a copyist. He is best known as the author of the book of piety Maalot ha-Middot. Yehiel stated at the beginning of the (Leiden) manuscript that he finished writing Zeraim and Moed on the 12th day of the month of Shevat, and added that he completed Nashim and Nizikin one and a half months later. = Other writings = * Tanya Rabbati, a work related to Shibbolei HaLeket (Hebrew, \\"The Gleaned Ears\\") Title page of an 1800 edition of Tanya Rabbati * Hilkhot She·∏•itah - on the laws of ritual slaughter (in manuscript).

This musar sefer begins and ends with a poetic work, and describes 24 character trait elevations in ethical conduct. It is based on talmudic, midrashic and other sources. Maalot HaMidot was hand- copied, later printed and reprinted, including translated into Ladino. Among the translations into other languages is Rabbi Shraga Silverstein's \\"The Book of Middoth.\\" = The twenty four middos and their opposites = Leiden Jerusalem Talmud  Jehiel ben Jekuthiel Anav was the copyist who hand-copied what today is known as the Leiden Jerusalem Talmud. The Leiden Jerusalem Talmud (also known as the Leiden Talmud) is a medieval copy of the Jerusalem Talmud. The manuscript was written in 1289 CE, meaning it is the oldest complete manuscript of the Jerusalem Talmud in the world. The manuscript is also the only surviving complete (non-printed) manuscript of the Jerusalem Talmud. It is dated with the Hebrew year 5049 (Anno Mundi). The manuscript receives its name from the University of Leiden where it has been kept since the nineteenth century. Yehiel states at the beginning of the manuscript that he finished writing Zeraim and Moed on the 12th day of the month of Shevat. He subsequently states that he finished Nashim and Nizikin one and a half months later; the latter is two of the six orders of the Jerusalem Talmud in about six weeks. = Errors within the text = There are several errors throughout the manuscript which is consistent with many other Hebrew manuscripts of that period. Errors in Hebrew manuscripts were common since access to texts such as the Talmud was limited. This was partially due to the absence of printing. However most notably, Talmudic texts were rare since they were outlawed on several occasions. The most prominent example of this would be the Vatican decree to burn all Talmudic manuscripts. This decree led to the Paris book burnings of 1244. Yehiel writes that he copied the text from a different manuscript that was filled with scribal errors. However, Yehiel noted, he tried to correct as many errors as possible, and he humbly states 'I know that I have not corrected even half of the mistakes' and begs for the readers forgiveness. = Bomberg printing of the Jerusalem Talmud = During 1523-1524 the Jerusalem Talmud was printed for the first time in Venice by Daniel Bomberg. Jacob ben Hayyim ibn Adonijah, the editor of the Bomberg edition of the Jerusalem Talmud, used the Leiden Manuscript along with three other manuscripts as the basis of the printed edition of the Jerusalem Talmud. However, Jacob ben Hayyim ibn Adoniyahu considered the Leiden Manuscript the least accurate copy of the Jerusalem Talmud. The other three manuscripts of the Jerusalem Talmud used for the printing of Bomberg's edition of the Talmud have been lost, \\"with the exception of the Yerushalmi to tractate Horayot which was printed by Bomberg in his edition of the Babylonian Talmud. = University of Leiden = After the publication of the Bomberg edition of the Jerusalem Talmud the Leiden Talmud was lost for around three hundred years. It was only to be rediscovered in the mid nineteenth century in the Library of the city of Leiden. It had been entrusted to the Library by the notable Protestant scholar Joseph Scaliger who was a professor at Leiden.

The company's founder, Darren Green, was inspired by the well known Robot Wars (TV series).http://www.generation5.org/content/2001/ward.asp He noticed that Robot Wars was an interesting game, but the cost of a real bot and the know-how required drastically restricted its spread, so he decided to virtualize Robot Wars concepts into a new PC game, calling it RoboForge. RoboForge introduced an innovative concept: build your own robot (also called \\"bot\\" or \\"bots\\") on a limited virtual cost budget, then enter it into an arena with one other robot and run a full 3D robot battle until a robot's CPU or chassis is destroyed or time is called. Liquid Edge announced the game in July, 2000 and then released the first version on May 23, 2001. From July 2008 RoboForge became an open-source project with the Java-based source code available under a non- commercial license. The game's community continues development and it is now possible to download the game, build bots and enter them into amateur tournaments for free. Reception Since 2001 RoboForge attracted the interest of many gaming review websites as well as gaming magazines,http://www.actiontrip.com/reviews/roboforge.phtmlhttp://pc.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r18522.htm The general consensus was that RoboForge wasn't an \\"easy\\" game and that it required a lot of time and effort to build competitive robots.

He began practicing medicine in the city of Palanga, while organizing resistance to the ban and maintaining connections with socialists and revolutionaries who opposed the rule of the Russian Empire. In 1899, he managed to obtain government permit for America in the Bathhouse (Amerika pirtyje), the first Lithuanian-language theater performance in present-day Lithuania. These activities led to his arrest in 1900; he spent two years at a prison in LiepƒÅja, Latvia and was then exiled to the Siberian city of Yakutsk in 1902. His wife voluntarily accompanied him.

There is a central pediment and balustraded parapet and the central door has Ionic columns. Number 6 was associated with Sir Walter Scott in 1775. Numbers 9 to 13 became the Southbourne Hotel and is now divided into flats. Number 12 was associated with John Hunter FRS in 1785.

The term generally applies within liability insurance and property insurance, but is an element of other policies as well. Most often it applies where the original named insured needs to provide insurance coverage to additional parties so that they enjoy protection from a new risk that arises out of the original named insured's conduct or operations. An additional insured often gains this status by means of an endorsement added to the policy which either identifies the additional party by name or by a general description contained in a \\"blanket additional insured endorsement.\\" For instance, in vehicle insurance a typical Personal Auto Policy will cover not only the original named insured that purchased the auto policy, but will also cover additional persons while they are driving the auto with permission of the named insured. This is a simple type of blanket additional insurance arrangement, because it does not identify the additional insured by name, but by a \\"blanket\\" general description that will automatically apply to many persons. Similarly, in liability insurance, all directors, officers, and employees of a named insured company will also enjoy the status of being an insured, so long as they are acting in their capacity of carrying out the business of the named insured company. These persons enjoy insured status only while they pursue the business of the named insured. If they deviate to pursue their own affairs, they lose this extension of coverage. This extension of coverage to people with a constant and close relationship to the named insured company is accomplished via the \\"Who Is An Insured\\" section of the liability policy. In other cases, the original named insured wishes to extend coverage to others who would not come within these standard categories. To extend coverage further, Additional Insured Endorsements are added to the policy. Applications The usual reasons for including other parties as additional insureds is due to the close relationship or legal requirements between the original named insured and the additional insured. In most cases it is beneficial for a party to be covered as an additional insured on the policies of other parties because this will reduce the loss history of the additional insured and lower its premiums. The losses will be posted against the policies of the party providing the additional insurance and their premiums will rise accordingly. Typically, a larger and more powerful business will require that smaller entities (desiring to do business) have the larger business named as an additional insured. For example, a landlord in a commercial building will often require that a tenant have the landlord named as an additional insured on the tenant's insurance policies. In this manner, if there is an accident or loss on the tenant's premises (such as a fall or a fire), then the landlord will enjoy the benefits of the tenant's insurance coverage. Similarly, general contractors often require subcontractors to name the general and the owner on the subcontractor's policies. In this way, if the general contractor or owner are sued due to accidents arising out of the work of the subcontractor, the subcontractor's insurance will protect the general contractor and owner. The costs associated with the risk are returned to the party most able to control the risk of loss, the subcontractor. Similarly, manufacturers of products often wish to cover the sellers of the products as additional insureds under the manufacturer's liability policies. This helps induce the seller to promote the sale of the products, because the seller knows that any product liability lawsuit against the seller will be covered by the manufacturer's liability insurance. The cost of adding an additional insured to a property or liability insurance policy is generally low, as compared to the costs of the original premium. The underwriting departments of insurance companies, rightly or wrongly, often view the additional risk associated with additional insureds as marginal. Additional insurance coverage and endorsements are the subject of frequent disagreements, misunderstandings, and litigation. The disagreements are often about whether the additional insurance coverage should cover \\"independent negligence\\" by the additional insured, or should only cover liabilities caused by the named insured's acts. Generally, additional insured clauses are worded in broad terms, such as \\"any person or organization whom you (the named insured) are required to add as an additional insured on this policy under a written contract ... that person is only an additional insured with respect to liability arising out of 'your work' for that additional insured.\\" (CG 70 48 04 02) The clauses often include conditional limitations, such as limiting coverage to claims arising during the \\"ongoing operations\\" of the named insured, unless contracts require otherwise. And, they often contain assertions that they will be excess to other insurance policies (the \\"Other\\" Insurance problem). These can conflict with opposite provisions in other policies, leading to mutual repugnance of the Other Insurance clauses. Thus disputes often arise based on the relative responsibility of an insured in causing an incident, and the relative liabilities of their respective insurers. These disputes are further complicated by the fact that some of the original contracting parties may have contractually agreed to indemnify other parties. These indemnifications, in turn, can be liabilities to be covered by the policies pursuant to \\"insured contract\\" coverage. Courts in different states decide these disputes differently, depending on the unique facts of each case and the law of that particular state. Following the general rule that insurance policies are broadly interpreted in favor of coverage, such disputes are often resolved in favor of maximizing coverage for every insured.

He subsequently went into partnership with L.D.B. Gordon, becoming Chief Engineer of the Newport, Abergavenny & Hereford Railway, where he drew the specifications for both the wrought iron Crumlin Viaduct and the stone Hengoed Viaduct. After surveying the route for the Bedford and Cambridge Railway, he was Chief Engineer for the London extensions for both the Midland Railway, and Great Central Main Line. In 1838, whilst studying at the Freiburg School of Mines, Germany, L.D.B. Gordon visited the mines at Clausthal, and met Wilhelm Albert. Impressed by what he saw, he wrote to his friend Robert Stirling Newall, urging him to \\"Invent a machine for making wire ropes.\\" On receipt of Gordon's letter, Newall designed a wire rope machine. On Gordon's return to the UK in 1839, he formed a partnership with Newall and Liddell, registering R.S. Newall and Company in Dundee.

So the Knave returns them and pledges to not steal again. :The Queen of Hearts :She made some tarts, :All on a summer's day; :The Knave of Hearts :He stole those tarts, :And took them clean away. :The King of Hearts :Called for the tarts, :And beat the knave full sore; :The Knave of Hearts :Brought back the tarts, :And vowed he'd steal no more. The Knave of Hearts. Illustration by W.W. Denslow. The other stanzas published with it deal with nothing besides the domestic arrangements of the other three suits: \\"The King of Spades\\" flirts with the maids, so the Queen of Spades has them beaten and drives them out. She relents when the Knave appeals to her on their behalf. \\"The King of Clubs\\" and his wife constantly fight, but the Knave refuses to second him. The author opines that royalty who fight like that should be punished. \\"The Diamond King\\" and his wife would get along perfectly, except the Knave tries to seduce her; the author encourages the King to hang the Knave.Reichertz (2000), pp. 93‚Äì95 \\"The Queen of Hearts\\" proved by far the most popular of the stanzas, and entered popular culture, while the others fell into obscurity. Although it was originally published in a magazine for adults, it eventually became best known as a nursery rhyme. By 1785, it had been set to music. =Inspiration for characters= The King of Hearts. Illustration by W.W. Denslow. There has been speculation about a model for the Queen of Hearts. In The Real Personage of Mother Goose, Katherine Elwes Thomas claims the Queen of Hearts was based on Elizabeth of Bohemia. Benham, in his book Playing Cards: History of the Pack and Explanations of its Many Secrets, notes that French playing cards from the mid-17th century have Judith from the Hebrew Bible as the Queen of Hearts. However, according to W. Gurney Benham, a scholar who researched the history of playing cards: \\"The old nursery rhyme about the Knave of Hearts who stole the tarts and was beaten for so doing by the King, seems to be founded on nothing more than the fact that 'hearts' rhymes with 'tarts'.\\", quoting W. Gurney Benham (1959), Playing Cards: History of the Pack and Explanations of its Many Secrets Adaptations The poem's story is retold in a much expanded form in an 1805 poem known as King and Queen of Hearts: with the Rogueries of the Knave who stole the Queen's Pies by Charles Lamb, which gives each line of the original, followed by a poem commenting on the line.Lamb (1805) In 1844 Halliwell included the poem in the 3rd Edition of his The Nursery Rhymes of England (though he dropped it from later editions) and Caldecott made it the subject of one of his 1881 \\"Picture Books\\", a series of illustrated nursery rhymes which he normally issued in pairs before Christmas from 1878 until his death in 1886. \\"The Queen of Hearts\\" is quoted in and forms the basis for the plot of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Chapter XI: \\"Who Stole the Tarts?\\",Carroll (1865) a chapter that lampoons the British legal system through means of the trial of the Knave of Hearts,Fordyce (1994), p. 134 where the rhyme is presented as evidence. The poem became more popular after its inclusion in Carroll's work.

Opening in stages between 1888 and 1895, the line was closed to passengers in 1958, and to freight in 1963, however a short section of the line at the western end from Marton Junction to Southam, remained open for freight trains serving the cement works until 1985. Route and stations There were six stations on the line: * Weedon (which allowed interchange with the West Coast Main Line) * Daventry * Braunston * Flecknoe * Napton & Stockton * Southam & Long Itchington Trains to Leamington called at the now closed Leamington Spa (Avenue) station, and either terminated at the now closed Milverton station, or continued to . Weedon, Daventry and Braunston stations were in Northamptonshire, while the remainder were in Warwickshire. The line was single track throughout with passing loops at each of the stations except Flecknoe. Provision was made for a passing loop at Flecknoe, but it was never used. The line passed under the Great Central Main Line at Wolfhampcote between Braunston and Flecknoe, but there was never any physical connection between the two lines. History The market town of Daventry had been bypassed by the construction of the London and Birmingham Railway (L&BR;) in the 1830s (now part of the West Coast Main Line) which passed to the east of the town through Weedon. Desiring a railway connection to their town, in 1861 a group of Daventry businessmen founded the Daventry Railway Company to promote the construction of a branch line to Daventry from Weedon. However the company was unable to raise sufficient funds for the scheme and it was abandoned. The scheme was revived in the 1880s by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) the successor to the L&BR;, who constructed the line in two phases; Firstly they obtained powers in 1885 to construct a four-mile (6 km) long branch to Daventry from Weedon, this was opened on 1 March 1888. In 1890 the LNWR obtained powers to build a 14-mile (22 km) extension of the branch to reach their existing Rugby‚ÄìLeamington line at Marton Junction (just south of the village of Marton). The extension was opened on 1 August 1895. The line was built with economy in mind, and contained some steep gradients of up to 1 in 80, especially near Daventry. In 1906 a railmotor was experimentally used on the line, however it proved to be underpowered. Passenger services reverted to push‚Äìpull operation with a conventional locomotive for the rest of the line's existence. Ownership of the line passed to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) in 1923. And then British Rail in 1948. Passenger services originally consisted of four trains each way per day, with additional services between Weedon and Daventry, however by the 1920s and 30s this had grown to eleven trains each way per day, some of which continued to either Nuneaton or Northampton (requiring reversal at Blisworth). Additional trains also ran in the mornings and afternoons between Leamington and Flecknoe (later cut back to Napton) for the benefit of schoolchildren. A short lived slip coach service from London was introduced for a while in the 1900s but was not a success. The service was cut back sharply during World War II, and the pre-war timetable was never fully reintroduced. The growth in bus and car traffic meant that the passenger numbers declined from the 1940s onwards. Flecknoe station was the most remote station on the line and closed to passengers in 1952 but remained open for freight until 1956. All passenger services on the line were withdrawn on 13 September 1958.Warwickshire railways The site of Marton Junction in 2009: The line to Rugby ran straight ahead, whilst the line to Weedon diverged to the right. The main source of freight traffic on the line was the cement works near Southam, and this provided enough traffic to keep the line open for a number of years after passenger services had been withdrawn. However, the line was closed as a through route in December 1963, and the tracks between Weedon and Southam were lifted the following year. A short section was retained between Marton Junction and Southam to serve the cement works, along with a stretch of the Rugby-Leamington line from Rugby. Freight trains running to Southam had to reverse at Marton Junction. This last stretch was closed on 20 June 1985, and the tracks were lifted in 1987.

Less than a year after the creation of the ghetto, around 1942, most of approximately 20,000 Jewish inhabitants of Brest (Brze≈õƒá) were murdered; over 5,000 were executed locally at the Brest Fortress on the orders of Karl Eberhard Sch√∂ngarth; the rest in the secluded forest of the Bronna G√≥ra extermination site (the Bronna Mount, ), sent there aboard Holocaust trains under the guise of 'resettlement'.The statistical data compiled on the basis of \\"Glossary of 2,077 Jewish towns in Poland\\" by Virtual Shtetl Museum of the History of the Polish Jews , as well as \\"Getta ≈ªydowskie,\\" by Gedeon, and \\"Ghetto List\\" by Michael Peters at www.deathcamps.org/occupation/ghettolist.htm . Accessed . Background Before World War II, Brze≈õƒá nad Bugiem (known as Brze≈õƒá Litewski before the partitions, now Brest, Belarus) was the capital of Polesie Voivodeship in the Second Polish Republic (1918‚Äì39) with the most visible Jewish presence. In the twenty years of Poland's sovereignty, of the total of 36 brand new schools established in the city, there were ten public, and five private Jewish schools inaugurated, with Yiddish and Hebrew as the language of instruction. The first ever Jewish school in Brze≈õƒá history opened in 1920, almost immediately after Poland's return to independence. In 1936 Jews constituted 41.3% of the Brze≈õƒá population, or 21,518 citizens. Some 80.3% of private enterprises were owned by Jews. Before World War I, Brze≈õƒá (then known as Brest-Litovsk) was controlled by the Russian Empire for a hundred years following the partitions of Poland,Norman Davies, God's Playground (Polish edition), Second volume, p.512-513 and all commercial activity was largely neglected. , (Polish-Belarusian relations under the Soviet occupation). Bialorus.pl Brest-Litovsk was renamed as Brze≈õƒá nad Bugiem (Brest on the Bug) in the Second Polish Republic on March 20, 1923.Kancelaria Sejmu RP (2013), Dz.U. 1923 nr 39 poz. 269 ISAP Archive. Link to PDF document. Just before the outbreak of World War II, there was an anti-Jewish riot at the bazaar in Brze≈õƒá on May 15, 1939. Some Jewish sources categorize it as Polish although ethnic Belarusians constituted 17.8% of the population, and preached militant nationalism among its youth similar to local Ukrainians and Russians, under systematic indoctrination by Soviet emissaries.

Three did not survive the Holocaust 21 September 1939 a Jewish woman from Warsaw named Bajla Gelblung has been captured in the Brze≈õƒá Ghetto by the Germans In September 1939 during the German and Soviet invasion of Poland, the town of Brze≈õƒá (Brest) was overrun by the German troops and handed over to the Russians during the German‚ÄìSoviet military parade in Brest-Litovsk on September 22, 1939. The whole province was soon annexed by the Soviet Union following mock elections by the NKVD secret police, conducted among the locals in the atmosphere of fear and terror.Bernd Wegner (1997). From peace to war: Germany, Soviet Russia, and the world, 1939-1941\\\\. Berghahn Books. p. 74. . The mass deportations of Poles and Jews to Siberia followed. The German armed forces launched Operation Barbarossa against the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941, and Brze≈õƒá was captured the same day. On 24 June 1941, a 15 man Sicherheitspolizei detachment, commanded by SS-Untersturmf√ºhrer Schmidt, arrived in Brze≈õƒá. On December 16, 1941 the Germans placed Brest under the administration of the Reichskommissariat Ukraine and established a Nazi ghetto in the city for some 18,000 Polish Jews,The Wikipedia article Brest, Belarus gives the number of Ghetto residents as about 20,000 who still resided there after months of deportations and ad hoc mass executions. On July 10‚Äì12, 1941 the German Einsatzgruppe under SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer Karl Eberhard Sch√∂ngarth massacred 5,000 Jews including 13-year-old boys and 70-year-old men in a single night. The Order Police battalions passing through Brze≈õƒá and Bia≈Çystok carried out significantly larger shooting actions. \\"The first massacre of Brest Jews ‚Äì wrote Christopher Browning ‚Äì was perpetrated not by the notorious Einsatzgruppen but rather by Police Battalion 307 with Wehrmacht support, in mid-July, on the orders of Himmler's chief of Order Police, Kurt Daluege.\\". Old railway line near Bronna G√≥ra (the Bronna Mount, now in Belarus), with marked location of mass killings of Jews from the Brze≈õƒá Ghetto among other ghettos in the vicinity In August 1941 the Germans extracted a payment of some 26 million rubles worth of cash and valuables from the Jews of Brze≈õƒá. On 15 October 1942, Jews were rounded up for \\"relocation\\", and murdered over execution pits north-east of the city at the Bronna Mount (Bronna G√≥ra) forest. A few hundred Jews: infirm, Jewish police, hospital personnel, children at the children's home, and elderly at the home for the retired were killed in the ghetto itself. In the course of 2 days, some 16,000 were killed. Resistance organizations formed by Jews in the camp, \\"Liberation\\" and \\"Revenge\\", planned on attacking the Germans during the liquidation to create a diversion allowing Jews to escape. These plans were foiled by the Germans who were informed of these plans.Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos, 1933‚Äì1945, The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, edited by Geoffrey P. Megargee, volume 2, part B, pages 1337-1339 Some Jews managed to avoid the liquidation by going into hiding. The local police, consisting of Poles as well as Belorussians and Ukrainians, conducted regular searches for hiding Jews. Captured Jews were either shot by the police, or sent to prison. Some 300 to 400 Jews captured and held in the prison were subsequently transported by train to Baranowicze. Members of the communist underground acquired identification cards, at the end of 1941, for several individuals preventing their expulsion. Several families were hidden by the family of the head of the local communist underground P. Zhulikov (who perished himself in 1943). Following the recapture of the city by the Red Army in July 1944, only some 20 Jews are known to have survived in Brze≈õƒá. Recognized rescuers from the Brze≈õƒá area include P. Grigoriewicz, Maria i Ignacy Kurianowiczowie, W. Niesterenko, A. ≈Åabasiuk, A. Stelmaszuk. P. Makaren (for saving a young boy named M.

I.A. Altman, Moskwa 2009, p. 110. A Polish priest, Father Jan Urbanowicz, Dean of the Holy Cross Parish in Brze≈õƒá, was also executed by the Germans in June 1943 for aiding Jews. Post war The former ghetto has been the site of construction for Brest. In February 2019, a mass grave was discovered, with 600 bodies recovered, though it has been estimated that over 1,000 could be in this particular grave. Shoes, clothes, and personal items were recovered since January. By March 2019, over 1,214 bodies were recovered from the mass grave, which is measured at 40 meters in length and 2 meters deep. The Jewish community of Brest, and the Simon Wiesenthal Center has requested the site become an official Holocaust memorial. References Further reading  * .

The building was constructed in several phases. When the earthquake of 62 CE destroyed large parts of Pompeii, the Macellum was also damaged. Archeological excavations in the modern era have revealed a building that had still not been fully repaired by the time of the eruption of 79 CE. Of particular interest to researchers is the section of the Macellum located on the east side that is thought to have been dedicated to the imperial cult. It makes manifest how central a role the Emperors played in the lives of Romans as early as the 1st century. The other rooms on the west side are also interesting as examples of the link between economic and public life. Additionally, the market is an eloquent testimony to the everyday culture of the Romans, which is illustrated by archeological finds such as food remains, items of daily use and necessity, up to examples of Roman wall paintings.  Location  An older plan of the forum by August Mau. The Macellum is the building in the upper right corner. The Macellum of Pompeii is located outside the northeast corner of the forum. As the city continued to grow, it was necessary to relieve pressure on the forum. When the Macellum was first discovered, because of the twelve column bases in the center, the excavators at first believed it was a kind of pantheon, a temple dedicated to many gods.Heinrich Nissen, Pompeianische Studien, Leipzig 1877, pp. 278, 283 However, when subsequent excavation turned up the remains of cereals and fruits in the north side of the building and fish scales and bones in the middle of the courtyard, the archeologists realized that this was a market. The Macellum had three entrances: two main entrances, one in the middle of the west side to the forum and one in the middle of the north side to Via degli Augustali (a local road), plus a side entrance on the southeast that could only be reached using a small stairway. The shape of the Macellum is slightly misaligned with the forum because it had to fit between the two roads that flanked it to the north and south, the Via degli Augustali and the Vico del Balcone Pensile. To compensate, the shops that abut the forum on the west side increase in size from south to north. Construction features=Entrance and the West Side= Macellum of Pompeii - View from the outside to the Tabernae Three much restored marble columns from the portico of the forum, with Corinthian capitals, remain standing in front of the facade. The lower third of two of the columns is decorated with piped fluting, while the upper portion lacks fluting. Part of the entablature remains on top of the capitals. The lobby of the Macellum was particularly closely connected to the portico of the forum. Two rows of columns rose one above the other with no intermediary level. Hence, the portico appeared more like a facade.Concerning the construction and dimensions see Filippo Coarelli (ed.), Eugenio La Rocca, Mariette de Vos Raajimakers, Arnold de Vos, Pompeji: Arch√§ologischer F√ºhrer, L√ºbbe, Bergisch Gladbach 1993, 1999, pp. 180-185 The bases for honorific statues, which stood behind each column, are also still in place, but they lack their original marble cladding. Further bases for honorific statues were located in front of the corner columns of the tabernae (shops) at the front of the building. These spaces constructed in opus incertum (rubble stonework) were probably currency exchanges. A further portico must have been located inside the Macellum itself, but none of its columns remain. The only recognizable traces are a water gully and signs of where columns stood in it. Sketch of the Macellum The main entrance was divided into two by an aedicula for a statue with two elegant Corinthian columns. The statue was probably that of an emperor, in which case, the imperial cult is to be presumed to have begun at the entrance to the Macellum. Both columns are decorated with chimerae, which were not originally part of the Macellum, but belonged to one of the major tombs: the Tomba delle Ghirlande (Garland grave) on Via del Sepolchri (Street of Sepulchres) before the Herculaneum gate.Coarelli, La Rocca, de Voss, p. 181 The chimerae were presumably not produced in Pompeii, but probably originate in a workshop in Greece. However, it is also possible that they were manufactured in a neo-Attic workshop in Naples or Puteoli.Coarelli, La Rocca, de Voss, p. 181 Mural painting in the 4th style In addition, on the west side an example of the fourth style of Roman (so-called Pompeiian) decorative mural painting has been preserved. It apparently dates to the period after the great earthquake of 62 CE. Above the plinth are painted fields of black bordered in red. In the center of each, a mythological scene is depicted. In these Penelope recognizing the returned Odysseus, Io watched over by Argus, and Medea ruminating on the deaths of her children are recognizable. Between the individual panels are architectural vistas on a white background, with green and pale red buildings depicted in perspective. The delicate architectonic elements dominate the black panels and divide the upper area into fields in which single figures are depicted on a blue background. A girl with sacrificial equipment and a satyr playing an aulos can be seen. Above these, on large wall panels are painted still lifes with birds, poultry, wine-jars, fruit, flowers, baskets, and fish in a style similar to folk art. These depictions facilitate the identification of the building as a macellum. Another picture shows a donkey being crowned with garlands by Cupids. Millstones can be seen beside it. This painting probably symbolizes the festival of Vesta, on which the donkeys were relieved of work. =Courtyard, North and South= From the entrance, one enters a large courtyard. No traces were found of the portico that should be here; it is very likely that it was destroyed in the earthquake of 62 CE and not yet rebuilt by the time of the eruption. In fact excavation revealed the travertine base (stylobate) for the colonnade on the north side and for a small one on the west side. Presumably the portico columns had not yet been erected at all. This was not the only evidence of reconstruction: The walls of the inner enclosure and the spaces to the south and east also date to the post-62 restoration. They consist of opus incertum. Only the corner columns are constructed of brick and small tuff cubes in opus listatum (masonry in which bricks alternate with small stones). Twelve food stores were located on both sides of the side entrance. They were located on the north side so that their wares would be protected from strong sunlight and kept fresh. Figs, grapes, chestnuts, pulses, bread, cakes, amphorae, and fruits in jars (now in the Naples Museum) were found here. The Tabernae opened onto the Via delli Augustali and were not connected to the interior of the Macellum. The east wall and western portions of the north wall are of opus incertum to a height of 1.35 m, above which they consist of limestone and tuff. Above the stores there would have been attics in which butcher's assistants and other staff lived. A wooden gallery ran in front of the attics. Since no interior stairs were found, access must have been from outside the Macellum. On the south side, directly adjacent to the meat and fish hall on the Via del Balcone Pensile, is the third entrance. After the lararium was erected, the Via del Balcone Pensile became a cul-de-sac. To the height of the shrine (approximately 13 m), the external wall was constructed of opus reticulatum (masonry of rectangular stones arranged like a checkerboard or net). This masonry consists of multicolored tuff stones arranged in rows and enclosed by brick pilasters. This colorful display made a stucco coating unnecessary. In the opinion of some archeologists, this may be the finest example of a wall from the last phase of building at Pompeii.Coarelli, La Rocca, de Voss, p. 183 It abuts a wall of opus incertum (clearly older masonry, presumably from an earlier stage of construction). Within the Macellum on the south side are twelve shops. They are altogether roughly the same in size and construction. They were intended for the sale of foodstuffs, probably meat and fish. =Central structure= The remains of the central structure In the middle of the Macellum are the previously mentioned twelve column bases, which are made of tuff and arranged to define a dodecagonal space. They were initially thought to be remnants of a round shrine or tholos.Nissen, p. 281 A well and pool would have been located within it. The rotunda was thought to have resembled other macella, perhaps the elaborate Eastern Greek and African models, or Roman examples such as that in Puteoli. However, Amedeo Maiuri's excavations clarified that the column bases and the space within them had a different function. As proven by the many fish bones and scales discovered in the drainage trough that flowed into the middle, the space was intended for selling fish. They were gutted and cleaned here.Coarelli, La Rocca, de Voss, p. 184 The twelve column bases held wooden poles, which were embedded in the earth and anchored by the bases. The poles supported a wooden roof. There was presumably a well in the middle of the space, but there was no pool. The bases were restored in the 19th century, after having been discovered in very poor condition. The inner area is edged with a low marble lip, intended to prevent water from the middle flooding outward. The flooring consists of a mixture of crushed stone tiles, made of travertine, marble, and mortar. When this area was excavated by a group led by Giuseppe Fiorelli, it was still considered to be a kind of pantheon and thus initially given that name.T. Warscher, Pompeii - A guide through the ruins, Berlin - Leipzig 1925, p. 17 =Imperial cult room= Three other rooms were located on the east side. They are on a higher level than the rest of the Macellum. The space in the middle was dedicated to the imperial family, the imperial cult room. Some books designate this space the sacellum, or chapel.For example Warscher It is accessed via a five-step stairway. In comparison to the rest, this room is very simple in its decor. The entrance was decorated with a bar pattern. There is a pedestal on the back wall, and two niches are recessed into the side walls on each side. In the niches on the right are plaster casts (poor copies in the opinion of some archeologistsFor example Warscher) of the two statues which were found here. The originals are now in the National Museum of Naples. They were erroneously believed to be likenesses of Marcellus and Octavia.Coarelli, La Rocca, de Voss, p. 282 Marcellus was the patron of Pompeii, so the supposition was valid. The figures in the other niches were presumed to be Agrippina and Nero. Today they are believed to be two other as yet unidentified members of the imperial family.T. Warscher; MR Srgejenko, Pompeii, Leipzig 1953, p. 118 Additionally, an arm with a globe in its hands was found here. It perhaps belonged to the statue of the Emperor.Coarelli, La Rocca, de Voss, p. 282 In the view of Heinrich Nissen, the rear wall of the room had already been broken through in antiquity and three of the five statues removed. Further, he saw only two possible combinations of statues: #In the central position a statue of Augustus as Jupiter with a globe in his hand, in the niches to the right Livia and Drusus, and in the niches to the left Tiberius and Germanicus.Nissen, p. 282 #More likely, however, a statue of Jupiter stood on the pedestal in the center of the rear wall and Livia and Augustus stood in the niches on the left and Drusus and Tiberius in those on the right. During his lifetime, Augustus never had himself portrayed as Jupiter with the globe.Nissen, p. 282 Nissen regarded the two extant statues as Livia and Drusus.Nissen, p. 282 He cited in support of this identification that the following inscription may have been located under the statue he identified as Livia: {  align=\\"center\\" width=\\"500\\"  AVGVSTAE.IVLIAe DRVSI.F DIVI.AVGVSTI D.D.Nissen, p. 283: \\"Founded as an offering to Empress Julia and to Drusus, son of the divine Augustus.\\" The Macellum was excavated in one of the early phases of excavation of Pompeii. Conditions at the time led to the destruction of possible inscriptions. } Over a hundred years later, Paul Zanker put forward the view that Augustus did have himself depicted as Jupiter and that in the niches on the right were people honored by the city who had earned recognition around the market. The man, who had probably already died at the time the statue was erected, was depicted in a heroically exaggerated manner on the model of the Emperor, with draped hips and bare upper torso. The woman is depicted as a priestess, with a wreath and a container of incense. She was perhaps the sacerdos publica, who played an important role as patroness.Paul Zanker, Pompeji, von Zabern, Mainz 1988, p. 28 The walls here are opus listatum and opus incertum. The side walls of the staircase are constructed in opus latericium (brickwork). Unfortunately only a few traces of the original stucco overlay have been preserved. =Association and meat sales rooms= The room adjoining the imperial cult room on the left was probably used for sacrificial feasts and religious ceremonies by the collegium or association responsible for conducting the imperial cult.Michael Grant: Pompeii, Herculaneum: Untergang und Auferstehung der St√§dte am Vesuv. Gondrom, Bindlach 1988 (original title: Cities of Vesuvius, 1971), p. 199 Considering the surroundings, it is not likely that gods other than the genius of the Emperor were honored here. According to other, older theories, it was the banqueting room of a merchant cooperative,Warscher, p. 19 or the seat of the market court.Nissen, p. 283 Immediately to the left of the entrance to this room, over a thousand coins were found. This could represent the treasury of a collegium or a merchant's daily take.. Other sources report that the treasure was found immediately at the northern entranceWarscher, p. 19 or in the meat sales room.Nissen, p. 283 Sheep skeletons, ox skulls, and bones were found in front of the association room; presumably there was at this point an area set apart for sacrificial animals or an enclosure for animals that were for sale. In the interior, an altar is visible placed to the right. It consists of two layers of marble with a basalt plate lying on top. The plate has a raised edge and a hole in one corner, which suggests that the altar was used for libations. The significance of the marble-clad podium beside the south wall remains unclear. It has been suggested that like the large side niches in the Building of Eumachia, it served as a place for the praecones (announcers or heralds) and the argentarii (money-changers) to stand.Coarelli, La Rocca, de Voss, p. 183 But the presumed religious significance of the room argues against this hypothesis. Two small murals of Cupids were also found here. In one painting they are seen drinking wine and playing a lyre; in the other they are depicted performing sacrifices. Nissen proposed that the podium served as the location of the images of the lares. In the room to the right of the imperial cult room, fish and meat were sold. A shop counter runs around three sides (north, east and south) of this room. There is a single break in this counter in the middle of the east wall, and on the south wall the counter ends after roughly a quarter of the length of the wall. The left half of the counter surface is equipped with a special device that served to collect the runoff water and direct it into a small drainage groove on the south side. This half was probably intended for the sale of fish. The entire counter inclines slightly, so that liquids could drain away. Construction history Investigation of the construction historyRegarding the construction history, see Coarelli, La Rocca, de Voss, pp. 180-185 of the Macellum dates to Amedeo Maiuri. The building seen today has been dated to 130-120 BCE, but was preceded by an earlier building of similar dimensions on the same site. That building, however, had no central rotunda. On the north and south sides, the layout of the original portico corresponded to that in the later building; on both the east and west sides, in contrast, it was more spacious. On the south side there was a row of tabernae that were not as deep and differently partitioned. On the east side there were some rooms with attractive wall decorations in the first style and a second colonnade at the front. The facade differed from that of the later building: it stood further forward, closer to the forum. The open marketplace was covered with a carefully polished and neatly compacted stone pavement. The tabernae had a floor made of stone chips and a mortar layer. In the rooms on the east side, the mortar was mixed with crushed bricks (called opus signinum). In the uncovered marketplace, the paving was in use until 62 CE; in the indoor spaces it was gradually replaced by opus signinum. In the Julio- Claudian period, the complex was reorganized and took on its final form. The original tuff colonnades were initially retained, but on the west side were cut through to erect a sacred aedicula of opus incertum, which was rapidly again forgotten. The tabernae on the west and north sides also belong to this phase of construction. However, the majority of the building dates from the period after the earthquake of 62 CE, which then led to the complete abandonment of the tuff colonnades. Only the lower story is preserved, but there was also an upper floor, in which there are presumed to have been attic quarters for Macellum workers. Access to the upper story was by means of a wooden stairway leading to a wooden gallery from which it was possible to reach the rooms.

The Janskerk or St. John's Church is a former church in the Dutch city of Haarlem. Today it houses the North Holland Archives (Noord-Hollands archief). History Gerard van Tetrode donated land in 1310 in the centre of Haarlem to build St. John's monastery. Later the St. Barbara gasthuis was founded in 1435 by the Hugo van Assendelft, priest of the St. John's monastery, on the south side of this area. The monastery's church and the old Gasthuis doorway are the only parts of the large complex that still exist today. It was a commandry of the Knights of Saint John and is the oldest church in Haarlem after the St. Bavochurch. The order of St. John was disbanded after the Protestant Reformation and the church reverted to the state in 1625. The Haarlem council sold most of the monastery's land, and much of the art during the following years, which added considerably to the wealth of the city. In 1936 it became the location of the Haarlem Archives, and it is now the location for the North Holland Archives.Deugd boven geweld, Een geschiedenis van Haarlem, 1245-1995, edited by Gineke van der Ree-Scholtens, 1995, Van Commanderij van Sint-Jan tot Noord- Hollands Archief.

The western terminus is at Pennsylvania Route 320 in Haverford Township, Pennsylvania. Its eastern terminus is at a Cobbs Creek bridge in Darby, Pennsylvania. Past this bridge is State Route 3023, which continues into Philadelphia. SR 2005 is known as Darby Road in Haverford Township, Lansdowne Avenue from U.S. Route 1 to Darby, and Main Street in Darby. Route description=Darby Road= SR 2005 begins at an intersection between two forks of Darby Road and Sproul Road (Pennsylvania Route 320) in Haverford Township, Pennsylvania. Immediately after its western terminus, the two forks join and proceed almost due east into woodland with some residential development. The area is generally referred to as Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania due to sharing a common ZIP code (19010) with the community; however, Bryn Mawr's census-designated place (CDP) is located wholly within Lower Merion Township. SR 2005 intersects side street Brennan Drive before crossing Ithan Creek shortly upstream from its mouth at Darby Creek. Carrying 9002 vehicles a day, the bridge is listed as functionally obsolete by the National Bridge Inventory (NBI). In evaluating the structural sufficiency of the bridge, the NBI stated that it is \\"somewhat better than minimum adequacy to tolerate being left in place as is,\\" estimating the improvement cost to be $99,000. Past the bridge, Darby Road becomes the border between Zip Code 19010 and Haverford, Pennsylvania, an unincorporated community defined by its Zip Code, 19041. SR 2005 then passes under Interstate 476 (Mid-County Expressway) but does not interchange. At the intersection with Radnor Road, the border between the two Zip Codes ends and Darby Road passes completely within Haverford. History Map of Haverford Township from 1913, showing Darby Road as Coopertown Road The road that provides access to Darby from Bryn Mawr was formed in 1687.Haverford Township Historical Society 2003, p. 21. Originally it was known as Darby Road in its entirety, but later on the section near the old cooperage in Bryn Mawr was renamed Coopertown Road.Haverford Township Historical Society 2003, p. 24. Today only the portion in Haverford Township is known as Darby Road. With the promulgation of the Sproul Road Bill on May 31, 1911, Pennsylvania began controlling and numbering state highways. Included in the bill was Legislative Route 180, which ran from the Delaware state line into Philadelphia. It was assigned to the portion of the historic Darby Road from MacDade Boulevard to its terminus at a Cobbs Creek bridge that had been built two years beforehand. In 1926, when the U.S. Highway system was formed, U.S. Route 13 absorbed LR 180 as a section of its routing. Around this time, roadwork was in progress for a portion of the historic Darby Road not covered by U.S. 13. In existence as a covered bridge since 1687, the bridge over Ithan Creek near Darby Road's western terminus was remodeled in 1932. It was turned into a conventional arch bride, removing the covering. By 1940, U.S. Route 13 was routed along its current alignment, to follow MacDade Boulevard north past Main Street instead of joining it at the intersection. U.S. Route 13 Bypass was also created by that year, splitting from U.S. 13 at the aforementioned intersection and heading northbound along Main Street and Lansdowne Avenue until what is now U.S. Route 1 (Township Line Road). Here, it followed Township Line Road and later City Avenue into Philadelphia. Township Line Road and City Avenue were signed as U.S. Route 1 Bypass, while the mainstem U.S. Route 1 followed Baltimore Pike into Philadelphia. U.S. Route 13 Bypass was deleted in 1967. In 1987, a Location Referencing System (LRS) was established to define roadways that the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation deemed important. The system added the concept of a quadrant route, a road given a uniform four digit number between 1000 and 4000 that was unique per county. Quadrant routes would only be signed in little white markers placed at major intersections. With the creation of the LRS; the historic Darby Road was assigned the number of 2005.

He was travelling in a train through the Rhine Valley when the idea came to him: \\"I had been glancing idly at a guide book, but the opening lines of a quaint legendary tale relating to some little village in the mountains suddenly held my interest, and when I had read it through I realised that here was the ideal story for an opera. Only the climax would have to be altered, for the story ended on a tragic note.\\"Somerville, Reginald. \\"Memories of The Mountaineers\\", in Music Masterpieces: Gems from the World's Famous Operas and Musical Plays, Percy Pitt (ed.), vol. 3, part 15 (London: Amalgamated Press, 1926), p. 76 Somerville showed The Mountaineers to Workman, who was at once interested. He assembled several financial backers and formed the Comic Opera Syndicate.The Era, 11 Sept 1909, p. 15 The press referred to the work as a Savoy opera.See, e.g., The Manchester Guardian, 17 September 1910, p. 1, advertising The Mountaineers. C. H. Workman in The Mountaineers The Mountaineers opened on 29 September 1909 at the Savoy Theatre, to a very enthusiastic audience. Critical response was mixed, however, with most critics finding the piece light, pleasant and entertaining, in an old-fashioned way.\\"The Mountaineers\\" in The Musical Times, Novello, 1909, p. 724 The Times declared that \\"it forms one of those instances of respectable mediocrity which are more difficult to describe than many far less meritorious works. This does not mean that it is dull, or 'not worth going to see.' On the contrary, it provides a very pleasant, pretty, amusing entertainment.... A good story, well told; but told without wit, without distinction.\\"\\"Savoy Theatre\\", The Times, 30 September 1909, p. 11 The Manchester Guardian found both the story and music \\"simple and charming\\" but felt that the subject was not \\"strong enough to occupy a whole evening\\" and did not think that Workman's part in the piece was convincing. The Musical Times called Somerville's music \\"graceful, melodious and, like the libretto, always refined\\"; it praised the comedy of Workman and the singing of Spain, Flemming, Legge and Rose. The authors quickly reacted to the critique, hiring Arthur Wimperis, the lyricist of The Arcadians, to brighten up the piece. Five new songs were added, as well as a duelling scene between Pierre and Gustave in the second act, and additional comic dialogue. The show contained songs that satirised the Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George, which did not deter Lloyd George from attending a performance in November 1909. On the evening of the performance, the theatre was picketed by suffragettes demonstrating against the government in general and Lloyd George in particular. The performance was interrupted by demonstrations in the theatre by suffragettes in the audience who had been organised by the Women's Social and Political Union. The demonstrators were expelled forcibly from the theatre. When one woman claimed property that had been left behind during the expulsion, Workman complained to Christabel Pankhurst, the leader of the Women's Social and Political Union, about the damage her members had caused.\\"Politics in the Theatre ‚Äì A 'Votes for Women' Demonstration\\", The Manchester Guardian, 12 November 1909, p. 7; and \\"Suffragettes and the Savoy\\", The Observer, 21 November 1909, p. 13 The Mountaineers closed on 27 November after 61 performances,G√§nzl, p. 1036 making way for Fallen Fairies, which needed to be rehearsed on the stage of the Savoy for an opening before Christmas.\\"The New Savoy Opera\\", The Observer, 7 November 1909, p. 9 The Mountaineers later toured in the British provinces with many of the same cast, under management of Harry P.

Today is the twentieth birthday of Clarice, the daughter of the comical Pierre, who is head of the Douane. Clarice is courted by two men: Conrad, a rich man from the city, and Fritz, a rugged mountaineer. The diligence arrives with the passengers, and Pierre informs his guests that his men must search their luggage for contraband. He meets Miss Spinifiex, a travelling English spinster, and discovers that she is quite wealthy. He invites her to make a stay with him in the hopes that he might acquire her diamonds. Clarice is unable to decide which of her suitors she prefers, so she reminds them of a local legend. The village coquette Annette says: \\"no right-minded girl in our village will listen to a man's suit until he has shewn his pluck by bringing her a sprig of Edelweiss from the highest peak yonder.\\" Conrad and Fritz agree to go at once and seek out the flower, but Pierre begs them not to go, for a snowstorm is coming. Act II ‚Äì The interior of Pierre's chalet It is evening, and Pierre's guests dance a mazurka. Pierre introduces Miss Spinifex to them, but when she meets Gustave, one of his subordinates, he becomes quite jealous. Annette has a slight romantic interest in Gustave, and she is equally jealous, so to exact revenge, Annette and Pierre agree to flirt with one another. Fritz has disguised himself as an organ grinder, seeking shelter from the blizzard, and when he meets Clarice, he offers to read her fortune. Her fortune is that she loves two men, but prefers the mountaineer. She declines to confirm his reading. Pierre catches Fritz and orders him to go to the mountain at once, find Conrad and bring him back alive for Clarice's sake. A new guest, Sergeant Frederico, arrives at the chalet. There is a rumour of immediate war with a neighbouring power, and he is hastening to the front. The reserves will shortly be called up. Pierre and Annette's plan has worked perfectly, and their respective love interests return to them. Clarice admits that she loves Fritz and wishes he would return. She falls asleep before the fireplace and has a vision of a spot high in the mountains with a shrine, before which a red light burns. Conrad lies insensible in the snow. He is discovered by Fritz, who reluctantly rescues Conrad. The dream ended, Clarice wakes to hear that Conrad is safe and sound, tucked up in bed. Fritz has brought him back alive, and Clarice begs Fritz's forgiveness. Act III ‚Äì The village Several weeks later, it is the wedding day of Clarice and Fritz. Annette and Gustave agree to get married before he grows to love her again. She has received a letter from Sergeant Frederico, who will come today to announce the names of those called to the front. Pierre gives a paper edelweiss to Miss Spinifex, inventing a grand story of how he retrieved the flower for her. She agrees to marry him at once. The Sergeant and the soldiers appear, and they are met by Conrad. It is revealed that only one man in the village has been summoned for active duty: Fritz. Conrad tries to bribe the Sergeant into forgetting Fritz. The wedding party appears, returning from the wedding, and the Sergeant delivers the unhappy news. Fritz bids farewell to Clarice and his friends, but Conrad steps forward and offers to be Fritz' substitute in the marching line. Clarice shows her gratitude and a gun is handed to Conrad as he prepares to march away to war. Roles and original cast Flemming and Spain *Pierre, a Custom House official (baritone) ‚Äì C. H.

After the Siege of Boston ended in March 1776, \\"General Washington was handsomely entertained\\" at the Bunch-of-Grapes, as was Lafayette, and General John Stark. In March, 1786, Rufus Putnam, Benjamin Tupper, Samuel Holden Parsons and Manasseh Cutler, met at the tavern and formed the Ohio Company of Associates, which led to a contract being drawn up, later approved by the Confederation Congress, that sold about a five percent of what was to become the State of Ohio to this group of Revolutionary War Veterans. This land was in the Southeastern part of Ohio. Provisions of the contract included setting aside two townships in the center of the purchase for a university. Thus Ohio University (first chartered as American Western University) became the first land grant institution of higher education in the United States, preceding the more famous Morrill Act land grant institutions by nearly three-quarters of a century.

Despite being returned to the throne by the tribal chieftains, Khudadad continued to have troubles administering the kingdom, and revolts continued. In 1875, British influence and money through the able assistance of Robert Sandeman resulted in the Mastung Agreement, which formed the basis for the Baloch confederacy. A new treaty between the British and the Khan followed shortly which together with British assistance succeeded in calming the revolts within a year. In 1893, Khudadad had his chief accountant and staff murdered for allegedly planning to assassinate him.

The lamp is considered to be among the most important objects in the museum's collection. It is feared that if sufficient funds cannot be raised to purchase the lamp, it will be purchased by a private collector and disappear from public view. If the Museum, which is undergoing a major renovation, manages to raise sufficient funds to purchase the menorah, it will be on view in a new gallery entitled \\"Judaism: A Living Faith\\", designed to display the museum's \\"magnificent\\" collection of Jewish ceremonial art. The Museum's collection of ceremonial art has been awarded \\"designated\\" status by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council in recognition of its outstanding national importance. In 2009 the family that has long loaned the lamp to the Museum announced that it wished to sell the lamp, a price of ¬£300,000 was set should the Museum wish to purchase the lamp.

Mary was the daughter of railroad magnate E.H. Harriman and sister to W. Averell Harriman, former New York State Governor and United States Diplomat. In 2015 she was posthumously inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame. Early life Mary Harriman Rumsey was born on November 17, 1881, the oldest of six children of railroad industrialist E.H. Harriman (1848‚Äì1909) and his wife, Mary Averell Harriman (1851‚Äì1932). Her siblings were Henry Neilson Harriman (1883‚Äì1888), Cornelia Harriman (1884‚Äì1966), who married Robert Livingston Gerry (1877‚Äì1957),New York Times article dated March 4, 1908EL Harriman at Arden Farms Carol Averell Harriman (1889‚Äì1948), who married R. Penn Smith in 1917. After his death in 1929, she married W. Plunket Stewart, a racing stable owner in 1930, William Averell Harriman (1891‚Äì1986), who in 1955 became the Governor of New York and who married Kitty Lanier Lawrence,Kathleen Mortimer, Rich and Adventurous, Dies at 93 then Marie Norton Whitney (1903‚Äì1970), and lastly to Pamela Beryl Digby Churchill Hayward (1920‚Äì1997), and Edward Roland Noel Harriman (1895‚Äì1978), who married Gladys Fries (1896‚Äì1983). Mary attended Barnard College, where she specialized in sociology and was a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma.  Career = The Junior League = Charles, Mary Averell, Mary, Charles Jr., c.1919 Inspired by a lecture on the settlement movement, Mary, along with several friends, began volunteering at the College Settlement on Rivington Street in New York City's Lower East Side, a large immigrant enclave. Through her work at the College Settlement, Mary became convinced that there was more she could do to help others. Subsequently, Mary and a group of 80 debutantes established the Junior League for the Promotion of Settlement Movements in 1901, while she was still a student at Barnard College. The purpose of the Junior League would be to unite interested debutantes in joining the Settlement Movement in New York City. Realizing their lack of experience in dealing with the issues that faced people seeking help at the settlement house, Mary and League leaders brought together experts on the Settlement Movement to provide lectures and instruction to Junior League members. With better preparation came greater engagement leading to increased interest in membership by women notable in New York society; members would come to include Eleanor Roosevelt, Dorothy Whitney Straight and Ruth Draper. As word of the work of the young Junior League women in New York spread, women throughout the country and beyond formed Junior Leagues in their communities. In time, Leagues would expand their efforts beyond settlement house work to respond to the social, health and educational issues of their respective communities. In 1921, approximately 30 Leagues banded together to form the Association of Junior Leagues of America to provide support to one another. With the creation of the Association, it was Mary who insisted that although it was important for all Leagues to learn from one another and share best practices, each League was ultimately beholden to its respective community and should thus function to serve that community's needs. As the 20th century progressed, more Junior Leagues were formed throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico and the United Kingdom. Now known as the Association of Junior Leagues International Inc. (AJLI), the organization encompasses 292 member Leagues, with over 160,000 members committed to continuing the legacy established by its founder. =Consumer Advisory Board= In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Mary to chair the Consumer Advisory Board (CAB) of the National Recovery Administration (NRA), the first government consumer rights group. Despite her inexperience, Mary's work with farming cooperatives and belief in the power of cooperation would come to be her greatest asset. Mary would promote the formation of consumer groups across the nation and encourage these groups to report their grievances to her office. Mary Rumsey's legacy to New Deal reforms would be continued by her younger brother, W. Averell Harriman. Averell was encouraged by his older sister to leave his finance job and join her and their friends, the Roosevelts, to advance the goals of the New Deal. Averell joined the NRA, marking the beginning of his political career.  Personal life  In 1910, Mary married sculptor and polo player Charles Cary Rumsey (1879‚Äì1922), shortly after the death of her father on September 9, 1909. Rumsey had been working at Arden House, creating one of the principal fireplace surrounds, as well as other decorative sculpture. By all accounts, the two had a happy marriage. Together they had a daughter and two sons. *Charles Harriman Rumsey (1911‚Äì2007) *Mary Averell Rumsey (b. 1913), who made her debut in 1932 at a party with over 1,100 guests. *Bronson Harriman Rumsey (1917‚Äì1939), who died when the plane he was riding in, along with Daniel S.

Education and military career Salem was born in 1920 to an Egyptian family in Sinkat, Sudan, which was united with Egypt at the time. He was raised in the Hilmiyyat Gadida neighborhood of Cairo, where he was educated at the Ibrahimiyyeh School. In 1938, he graduated from the Royal Military Academy of Egypt and Sudan. He, along with four other future members of the Free Officers, was ranked in the top 10 percent of his classes at the General Staff College by 1947. He graduated from college in 1948. That same year, Salem served in the Egyptian and Sudanese army in the Palestine War as an infantry officer.All the Revolution's Men Al-Ahram Weekly. 2002-07-24. Salem, Amer and Abdel Latif Boghdadi were included in the eight-member executive committee of the Free Officers. Career under Naguib and Nasser In the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 that overthrew King Farouk and the monarchy, Salim was given the task of commanding artillery units in al-Arish. Afterward, he became a member of the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC). Salem is rumoured to have had an affair with King Farouk's sister, Princess Fawzia, and to have helped smuggle her fortunes outside of Egypt. When Muhammad Naguib, the leader of the Free Officers, was selected by the RCC to become President of Egypt in 1953, Salem was given the posts of Minister of National Guidance, and Minister of State for Sudanese Affairs. As part of his national guidance post, Salem warned the Egyptian press against \\"rumour mongering\\" and threatened to suspend the licences of journalists who \\"deviated from the upright path.\\" Salem was committed strongly to preserving the Egyptian union with Sudan, which was under continual threat by the United Kingdom, which had occupied Egypt and Sudan since the end of the 19th century. Salah Salem photographed in Sudan in 1954. The photo earnt him the nickname the \\"Dancing Major\\" Salem earnt the nickname the \\"Dancing Major\\" after being photographed dancing with Sudanese tribesmen. Accusations that he was bribing Sudanese politicians later caused Naguib to block Salem's appointment as the Egyptian government's representative in Khartoum. When Gamal Abdel Nasser assumed the leadership of Egypt in late 1954, following the RCC's removal of Naguib, Salem was dispatched on a tour of Arab capitals, stopping first at Riyadh, where he helped forge a common Egyptian-Saudi Arabian policy of opposition to the British-sponsored Baghdad Pact, and the espousal thereof by the Iraqi government. He condemned Iraq's membership of the Baghdad Pact, saying: \\"This is a serious development which may threaten the Arab League and expose Arab nationalism to great dangers...\\" On January 31, 1955, he along with foreign and prime ministers from Lebanon, Jordan, and Syria met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri as-Said. The meeting ended with a realisation that the demands of Said's Iraq and Nasser' Egypt were irreconcilable. In the Suez Crisis of 1956, known in Egypt as the Tripartite Aggression, Salem is said to have demanded that Nasser hand himself over to the British forces invading the country, as a means of ending the war. Nasser ordered Salem, along with Abdel Haikm Amer, to Port Said and berated them in front of their army comrades for breaking down during the invasion and opting for surrender. In 1957, Nasser appointed Salem the editor of Al-Shaab newspaper. In 1960, Salem was made Chairman of the Press Syndicate. Due to chronic kidney disease, Salem died in 1962 after seeking treatment both in the Soviet Union, and the United States. A major street in Cairo is named after him.

The species was described in 1838 by James Forbes, gardener of the Duke of Bedford. Botanist David Hunt collected a specimen in 1971, when he located one near Sierra de Tepoztlan, Mexico. The cylindrical and elongated plants grow up to tall and wide. They reach full height after five to ten years. The spines are red-brown or white, with cream-colored radials and pink, funnel-shaped flowers that grow in a ring around the apex of the stem to approximately long. It grows low to the ground in solitary or in clusters, and its flowers produce generally bright red berries that are club-shaped, smooth, and juicy. M. spinosissima thrive in well-drained soils that are sandy or loam, with a pH ranging from acidic to neutral. They prefer low humidity and full, filtered sun. Plants are typically watered once every two or three weeks, and kept nearly dry during the winter months. They require no pruning and make good patio and container plants. They are relatively disease resistant, but susceptible to pests such as mealybugs. Synonyms of M. spinosissima include Mammillaria centraliplumosa, Mammillaria haasii, and Mammillaria virginis. Taxonomy Sierra de Tepoztlan Carl Linnaeus designated Mammillaria as a type genus for cactus in 1753. In 1838, James Forbes, gardener of the Duke of Bedford, listed and described a species he called Echinocactus spinosissimas from a group of cacti he had acquired in Europe three years earlier. Nathaniel Lord Britton and Joseph Nelson Rose believe that Forbes was given that name by Ludwig Karl Georg Pfeiffer, but the plant was actually Mammillaria spinosissima. Pfeiffer had published the first infrageneric division of Mammillaria in 1837, dividing the genus into two groups based on distinct spine characteristics. In 1845, Joseph zu Salm- Reifferscheidt-Dyck ‚Äì based on work by Frederick Scheer ‚Äì expanded the classification into eight groups. With at least 145 recognized species, it is one of the largest and most morphologically variable genera in the cactus family. Others estimate there are as many as two hundred species of Mammillaria, including sixty-two cultivated species from India. Though larger, the genus Opuntia is less popular with gardeners and landscapers. Mammillaria was previously thought to be monophyletic, but phylogenic analysis indicates that Mammilloydia is \\"embedded within a 'core' group of Mammillaria species.\\" A specimen of Mammillaria spinosissima was collected by Botanist David Hunt in September 1971, when he located one in Mexico, near the Morelos Cautla- Cuernavaca toll road in Sierra de Tepoztlan, at an altitude of . =Similar species, subspecies and synonyms= Species similar to Mammillaria spinosissima include Mammillaria backebergiana and Mammillaria meyranii. Subspecies include M. spinosissima pilcayensis, synonym: Bravo (D. R. Hunt), M. spinosissima tepoxtlana (D. R. Hunt), and M. spinosissima spinosissima (Lem.). Synonyms of M. spinosissima include Mammillaria centraliplumosa (Fittkau), Mammillaria haasii (J. Meyr√°n), and Mammillaria virginis (Fittkau and Kladiwa). Description In the United States Botanic Garden Mammillaria spinosissima, also known as spiny pincushion cactus, are cylindrical plants that grow up to tall and wide. They reach full height after five to ten years. The spines are red-brown or white, with cream-colored radials and pink, funnel-shaped flowers that grow in a ring around the apex of the stem to approximately long. The relatively small cacti are globular or elongated, and the flowers produce generally bright red berries that are club-shaped, smooth, and juicy. Mammillaria species tend to grow low to the ground in solitary or grouped in clusters. The genus is marked by its dimorphic areoles: the spine bearing, or vegetative, areoles are located on the apex of the tubercle, and flowering areoles are located inside the axils of the tubercles. The stem is woolly and covered with bristles. Native habitat The genus Mammillaria native habitat ranges from Colombia and Venezuela to the Southwestern United States. Its diversity is greatest in Mexico. Species have also been documented in the West Indies. M. spinosissima is endemic to central Mexico and concentrated in the states of Guerrero and Morelos, where they grow at elevations of approximately ; they prefer dry, tropical forests and xerophilous scrub. The subspecies pilcayensis is named for its occurrence in the Barranca de Pilcaya, in Guerrero. Cultivation Britton and Rose believe that M. spinosissima has been in cultivation since at least 1835. The species thrives in well-drained soils that are sandy or loam, with a pH that is acidic, alkaline, or neutral. They prefer low humidity, and grow well under glass, with full, filtered sun from the south, north, and east. Plants are typically watered once every couple of weeks, and kept nearly dry during the winter months. Propagation is facilitated by offsets of seeds sown in early spring in weather. They require no pruning and make good patio and container plants. They are disease resistant, but are susceptible to pests such as mealybugs.

It came into being on February 2, 1949, as a result of a merger of The Bryan Democrat and The Bryan Press. On September 12, 1949, it became a daily newspaper delivered six days per week, Monday through Saturday. History The Bryan Press, a weekly newspaper, had its roots in the Republican Standard of 1854 and the twice- weekly Bryan Democrat which began in 1863. The Bryan Democrat, founded by Robert N. Patterson, held its name through 1949 while the forerunners of The Bryan Press went through a series of name changes until 1869. At the time of the merger The Bryan Press was owned by Paul Van Gundy and Howard Carvin. In 1923 Cass Cullis came to Bryan when he purchased the Democrat. Cullis had previously owned newspapers in Fayette, Ohio; Swanton, Ohio; and Buchanan, Michigan. Following World War II, Cullis' son, Ford Cullis, joined his father in operating the newspaper. According to Ford, it was evident that Bryan needed a daily newspaper, but World War II slowed the change. New equipment, parts, and repairs were difficult to get, newsprint was scarce, and skilled help was difficult to find. By early 1948, the Democrat was able to find used equipment in satisfactory condition. The shop had three linotypes and automatic typesetting equipment was available. The real need for the newspaper in 1948 was a press to replace the slow-moving Babcock; this press had a separate folder, requiring hours of extra work. The choice was a Goss Comet purchased from the Celina Daily Standard, owned by the Parker Snyder family. It printed and folded 3,000 copies per hour. It was this press that made a daily newspaper possible. The Bryan Times became the 100th daily newspaper in Ohio. In 1949 the Times was located at 108 E. Butler Street in Bryan. That building was small and soon became inconvenient since the shop equipment was on the upper floor and the press was in the basement. In 1958 Ford Cullis bought the property at 121‚Äì127 South Walnut Street, where the current offices are located. Plans were made for the new building. The pressroom, with a new press and a rotary press purchased from The Defiance Crescent News, was built in 1961. The entire operation was moved to its new location in October 1962. Since the press room was built the building has undergone several expansions, including a new press room and a mailroom. By 1963 the Times had doubled its circulation to 6,000 and had begun to move its circulation base out into the entire area of Williams County. In 1968 the Times purchased a 1968 Goss Community offset press, which was used until the printing of the paper was outsourced to Fort Wayne Newspapers in March 2015. Cass Cullis was the co- publisher of The Bryan Times from 1949 until his death in 1980; Ford Cullis was co-publisher until his death in 2008. Christopher Cullis joined the Times in June 1981 as the assistant publisher and became co-publisher in 1992. Following his father's death in 2008, Christopher Cullis became the sole publisher. In 2010 Kimberly Cullis Imm joined her father as assistant publisher, bringing the Times into its fourth generation of Cullis management. The Bryan Times is owned by the Bryan Publishing Company, which also publishes the daily Napoleon Northwest Signal, the weekly Montpelier Leader Enterprise, the free distribution, twice-monthly Countyline, and monthly real estate magazine Realty Northwest.The Bryan Times, Saturday, September 12, 2009 The weekly Leader Enterprise of Montpelier, Ohio, ended publication with its final issue on the last Wednesday in February, Feb. 27, 2019.

With committed backing from academia, governments and industry, GEM contributes to achieving profound, lasting reductions in earthquake risk worldwide by following the priorities of the Hyogo Framework for Action. From 2009 to 2013 GEM is constructing its first working global earthquake model and will provide an authoritative standard for calculating and communicating earthquake risk worldwide. Since March 2009, GEM is a legal entity in the form of a non-profit foundation based in Pavia, Italy. The GEM Secretariat is hosted at the European Centre for Training and Research in Earthquake Engineering (EUCENTRE). The current secretary general is John Schneider.  Mission  Between 2000 and 2010 over half a million people died due to earthquakes and tsunamis, most of these in the developing world, where risks increase due to rapid population growth and urbanization.see a.o. http://www.geohazards.no/projects/project3_08/project_3_earthq.htm ‚Äì figure2 However, in many earthquake-prone regions no risk models exist, and even where models do exist, they are inaccessible. Better risk-awareness can reduce the toll that earthquakes take by leading to better construction, improved emergency response, and greater access to insurance. GEM will provide a basis for comparing earthquake risks across regions and across borders, and thereby take the necessary first step towards increased awareness and actions that reduce earthquake risk. GEM tools will be usable at the community, national and international level for uniform earthquake risk-evaluation and as a defensible basis for risk-mitigation plans. GEM results will be disseminated all over the world. GEM will build technical capacity and carry out awareness- raising activities.  Scientific framework  The GEM scientific framework serves as the underlying basis for constructing the global earthquake model, and is organised in three principal integrated modules: seismic hazard, seismic risk and socio-economic impact. * The hazard module calculates harmonised probabilities of earthquake occurrence and resulting shaking at any given location. * The risk module calculates damage and direct losses resulting from this damage such as fatalities, injuries and cost of repair. Damage due to strong ground shaking is calculated by combining building vulnerability, population vulnerability and exposure. GEM will furthermore develop remote-sensing and crowd-data collection techniques to classify, monitor and regularly update building inventory and thus regional vulnerability. * The socio-economic impact module of GEM will provide tools and indices to both estimate and communicate the impact from earthquakes on the economy and society, concentrating in particular on indirect losses. For example, the impact on a company's revenue, on budgets, on poverty. The module will allow for calculations of scenarios which that enable cost/benefit analysis of mitigating actions, such as systematic building strengthening, and facilitate insurance and alternative risk transfer. 500px  Implementation  It will take five years to build the first working global earthquake model ‚Äì including corresponding tools, software and datasets. The work started in 2009 and will be finished at the end of 2013. Construction occurs in various stages that are partly overlapping in time. The pilot project GEM1 (January 2009 ‚Äì March 2010) generates GEM's first products and initial model building infrastructure, Global components will establish a common set of definitions, strategies, standards, quality criteria and formats for the compilation of databases that serve as an input to the global earthquake model. They are addressed by international consortia that respond to calls for proposals on hazard, risk and socio-economic impact. Global components will provide preliminary data on a global scale, but on a local scale, regional and national programmes will provide more detailed and reliable data. One Global component was the Global GMPEs project that proposed a set of ground motion prediction equations for use when calculating seismic hazard. Regional Programmes are projects with targeted funding taking place in various regions of the world; currently in the Middle East and Europe programs have already been completed. The data produced on a regional and national scale will be carefully quality-controlled and integrated into the global models. The actual development of the model will occur using a common, web-based platform for dynamic sharing of tools and resources, in order to create software and online tools as end-products. The global earthquake model will be tested and evaluated before its official release; the testing procedure will involve the establishment of scientific experiments that are reproducible, transparent, and set up within a controlled environment. GEM is however more than the creation and release of this first version of the model. GEM strives for continuous improvement of the model and will ensure that results are disseminated, technology is transferred through training and workshops and that awareness raising activities are deployed in order to contribute to risk reduction worldwide.

Although during the civil war he worked in diverse publications, it is in the 1940s when he becomes professional in the world of the comic strip, working for the editorials Marco, Bruguera and Hispano Americana. https://www.lambiek.net/artists/f/figueras_alfonso.htm In the latter, he published several works in the magazine Leyendas infantiles, where, among other things, he traced pages to color of the classic North Americans (Flash Gordon, Tarzan, Terry and the Pirates, etc.), to be able to print them in black and white later. In this occupation he meet other famous comic writers, like Juan Garc√≠a Iranzo. https://www.lambiek.net/artists/f/figueras_alfonso.htm Between 1946 and 1947 he published several series of comic strip of realistic drawing, like Mysto (magazine Chicos, 1946), Mr. Radar (magazine El Coyote, 1947) and the Electrical Man (also in El Coyote, that same year). After these publications, he left the realistic style definitively to concentrate in the humoristic comic strip.

History The union was founded in 1921, when the Civil Service Clerical Union and the Clerical Officers' Association merged to form the Civil Service Clerical Association (CSCA). It affiliated with the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and the Labour Party and had around 16,000 members. Its Dublin branch left the following year, to form the Civil and Public Services Union. Following the 1926 United Kingdom general strike, the Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927 was passed, requiring government employees to disaffiliate from political parties and trades union confederations, compelling the union to leave the Labour Party and the TUC. It rejoined the TUC in 1946. In 1969, the union renamed itself the Civil and Public Services Association. In 1973, the Ministry of Labour Staff Association joined the CPSA, then the Court Officers Association joined in 1974. In 1980, the CPSA published a history of its first 75 years, From Humble Petition to Militant Action. In 1985, the union's Postal and Telecommunications Group left to merge with the Post Office Engineering Union, forming the National Communications Union. The CPSA merged with the Public Services, Tax and Commerce Union in 1998, forming the Public and Commercial Services Union. 1986 General Secretary Election Militant supporter John Macreadie initially won the ballot.

A single-board microcontroller is a microcontroller built onto a single printed circuit board. This board provides all of the circuitry necessary for a useful control task: a microprocessor, I/O circuits, a clock generator, RAM, stored program memory and any necessary support ICs. The intention is that the board is immediately useful to an application developer, without requiring them to spend time and effort to develop controller hardware. As they are usually low- cost, and have an especially low capital cost for development, single-board microcontrollers have long been popular in education. They are also a popular means for developers to gain hands-on experience with a new processor family.  Origins  Single-board microcontrollers appeared in the late 1970s, when the appearance of early microprocessors, such as the 6502 and the Z80, made it practical to build an entire controller on a single board, as well as affordable to dedicate a computer to a relatively minor task. In March 1976, Intel announced a single-board computer product that integrated all of the support components required for their 8080 microprocessor, along with 1 kilobyte of RAM, 4 kilobytes of user-programmable ROM, and 48 lines of parallel digital I/O with line drivers. The board also offered expansion through a bus connector, but could be used without an expansion card cage when applications did not require additional hardware. Software development for this system was hosted on Intel's Intellec MDS microcomputer development system; this provided assembler and PL/M support, and permitted in-circuit emulation for debugging.Intel SBC 80/10 Single Board Computer brochure, 1976 Processors of this era required a number of support chips to be included outside of the processor. RAM and EPROM were separate, often requiring memory management or refresh circuitry for dynamic memory. I/O processing might have been carried out by a single chip such as the 8255, but frequently required several more chips. A single-board microcontroller differs from a single-board computer in that it lacks the general-purpose user interface and mass storage interfaces that a more general-purpose computer would have. Compared to a microprocessor development board, a microcontroller board would emphasize digital and analog control interconnections to some controlled system, whereas a development board might by have only a few or no discrete or analog input/output devices. The development board exists to showcase or train on some particular processor family and, therefore, internal implementation is more important than external function.  Internal bus  The bus of the early single-board devices, such as the Z80 and 6502, was universally a Von Neumann architecture. Program and data memory were accessed via the same shared bus, even though they were stored in fundamentally different types of memory: ROM for programs and RAM for data. This bus architecture was needed to economise the number of pins needed from the limited 40 available for the processor's ubiquitous dual-in-line IC package. It was common to offer access to the internal bus through an expansion connector, or at least provide space for a connector to be soldered on. This was a low-cost option and offered the potential for expansion, even if it was rarely used. Typical expansions would be I/O devices or additional memory. It was unusual to add peripheral devices such as tape or disk storage, or a CRT display Later, when single-chip microcontrollers, such as the 8048, became available, the bus no longer needed to be exposed outside the package, as all necessary memory could be provided within the chip package. This generation of processors used a Harvard architecture with separate program and data buses, both internal to the chip. Many of these processors used a modified Harvard architecture, where some write access was possible to the program data space, thus permitting in- circuit programming. None of these processors required, or supported, a Harvard bus across a single-board microcontroller. When they supported a bus for expansion of peripherals, a dedicated I/O bus, such as I¬≤C, 1-Wire or various serial buses, was used.  External bus expansion  Some microcontroller boards using a general-purpose microprocessor can bring the address and data bus of the processor to an expansion connector, allowing additional memory or peripherals to be added. This provides resources not already present on the single board system. Since not every system will require expansion, the connector may be optional, with a mounting position provided for installation by the user if desired.  Input and output  Arduino Diecimila with Atmel ATMEGA168 Microcontroller systems provide multiple forms of input and output signals to allow application software to control an external \\"real-world\\" system. Discrete digital I/O provides a single bit of data (on or off). Analog signals, representing a continuous variable range, such as temperature or pressure, can also be inputs and outputs for microcontrollers. Discrete digital inputs and outputs might be buffered from the microprocessor data bus only by an addressable latch, or might be operated by a specialized input/output IC, such as an Intel 8255 or Motorola 6821 parallel input/output adapter. Later single-chip microcontrollers have input and output pins available. These input/output circuits usually do not provide enough current to directly operate devices like lamps or motors, so solid-state relays are operated by the microcontroller digital outputs, and inputs are isolated by signal conditioning level-shifting and protection circuits. One or more analog inputs, with an analog multiplexer and common analog-to-digital converter, are found on some microcontroller boards. Analog outputs may use a digital-to- analog converter or, on some microcontrollers, may be controlled by pulse- width modulation. For discrete inputs, external circuits may be required to scale inputs, or to provide functions like bridge excitation or cold junction compensation. To control component costs, many boards were designed with extra hardware interface circuits but without the components for these circuits installed, leaving the board bare. The circuit was added as an option on delivery, or could be populated later. It is common practice for boards to include \\"prototyping areas\\", areas of the board laid out as a solderable breadboard area with the bus and power rails available, but without a defined circuit. Several controllers, particularly those intended for training, also include a pluggable, re-usable breadboard for easy prototyping of extra I/O circuits that could be changed or removed for later projects. Communications and user interfaces Communications interfaces vary depending on the age of the microcontroller system. Early systems might implement a serial port to provide RS-232 or current loop. The serial port could be used by the application program or could be used, in conjunction with a monitor ROM, to transfer programs into the microcontroller memory. Current microcontrollers may support USB, wireless networks (Wi-Fi, ZigBee, or others), or provide an Ethernet connection. In addition, they may support a TCP/IP protocol stack. Some devices have firmware available to implement a Web server, allowing an application developer to rapidly build a Web-enabled instrument or system.  Programming  Many early systems had no internal facilities for programming, and relied on a separate \\"host\\" system for this task. This programming was typically done in assembly language, or sometimes in C or PL/M, and then cross-assembled or cross-compiled on the host. Some single-board microcontrollers support a BASIC language system, allowing programs to be developed on the target hardware. Hosted development allows all the storage and peripherals of a desktop computer to be used, providing a more powerful development environment. = EPROM burning = Early microcontrollers relied on erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM) devices to hold the application program. The object code from a host system would be \\"burned\\" onto an EPROM with an EPROM programmer. This EPROM was then physically plugged into the board. As the EPROM would be removed and replaced many times during program development, it was common to provide a ZIF socket to avoid wear or damage. Erasing an EPROM with a UV eraser takes a considerable time, and so it was also common for a developer to have several EPROMs in circulation at any one time. Some microcontroller devices were available with on-board EPROM. These would also be programmed in a separate burner, then put into a socket on the target system. The use of EPROM sockets allowed field updates to the application program, either to fix errors or to provide updated features. = Keypad monitors = A single-board computer with a hex keypad and 7-segment display When the single-board controller formed the entire development environment (typically in education), the board might also have included a simple hexadecimal keypad, calculator-style LED display, and a \\"monitor\\" program set permanently in ROM. This monitor allowed machine code programs to be entered directly through the keyboard and held in RAM. These programs were in machine code, not even in assembly language, and were often assembled by hand on paper before being inputted. It is arguable as to which process was more time-consuming and error prone: assembling by hand, or keying byte-by- byte. Single-board \\"keypad and calculator display\\" microcontrollers of this type were very similar to some low-end microcomputers of the time, such as the KIM-1 or the Microprofessor I. Some of these microprocessor \\"trainer\\" systems are still in production today, used as very low-cost introductions to microprocessors at the hardware programming level. = Hosted development = When desktop personal computers appeared, initially CP/M or Apple II, then later the IBM PC and compatibles, there was a shift to hosted development. Hardware was now cheaper and RAM capacity had expanded such that it was possible to download the program through the serial port and hold it in RAM. This massive reduction in the cycle time to test a new version of a program gave an equally large boost in development speed. This program memory was still volatile and would be lost if power was lost. Flash memory was not yet available at a viable price. As a completed controller project was usually required to be non-volatile, the final step in a project was often to burn it to an EPROM.  Single-chip microcontrollers  8048-family microcontroller with an on-board UV EPROM, the 8749 PIC family device Single-chip microcontrollers, such as the Intel 8748, combined many of the features of previous boards into a single IC package. Single-chip microcontrollers integrate memory (both RAM and ROM) on-package and, therefore, do not need to expose the data and address bus through the pins of the IC package. These pins are then available for I/O lines. These changes also reduce the area required on the printed circuit board and simplify the design of the single-board microcontroller. Examples of single-chip microcontrollers include: * Intel 8748 * PIC * Atmel AVR = Program memory = For production use as embedded systems, the on-board ROM was either mask programmed at the chip factory or one-time programmed (OTP) by the developer as a PROM. PROMs often used the same UV EPROM technology for the chip, but in a cheaper package without the transparent erasure window. During program development, it was still necessary to burn EPROMs. In this case, the entire controller IC, and therefore the ZIF sockets, would be provided. With the development of affordable EEPROM and flash memory, it became practical to attach the controller permanently to the board and to download program code from a host computer through a serial connection. This was termed \\"in-circuit programming\\". Erasure of old programs was carried out by either over-writing them with a new download, or bulk erasing them electrically (for EEPROM). The latter method was slower, but could be carried out in-situ. The main function of the controller board was then to carry the support circuits for this serial or, on later boards, USB interface. As a further convenience during development, many boards also had low-cost features like LED monitors of the I/O lines or reset switches mounted on board.  Single-board microcontrollers today  Dwengo board It is now cheap and simple to design circuit boards for microcontrollers. Development host systems are also cheap, especially when using open source software. Higher level programming languages abstract details of the hardware, making differences between specific processors less obvious to the application programmer. Rewritable flash memory has replaced slow programming cycles, at least during program development. Accordingly, almost all development now is based on cross-compilation from personal computers and programs are downloaded to the controller board through a serial-like interface, usually appearing to the host as a USB device. The original market demand for a simplified board implementation is no longer as relevant for microcontrollers. Single-board microcontrollers are still important, but have shifted their focus to: * Easily accessible platforms aimed at traditionally \\"non-programmer\\" groups, such as artists, designers, hobbyists, and others interested in creating interactive objects or environments.Arduino's home page Some typical projects in 2011 included: the backup control of DMX stage lights and special effects, multi-camera control, autonomous fighting robots, controlling bluetooth projects from a computer or smart phone, LEDs and multiplexing, displays, audio, motors, mechanics, and power control.Arduino User's forum These controllers may be embedded to form part of a physical computing project.

Wyndham Vale station, Melbourne, Australia. A lockable bike cage in Templin, Germany A lockable bike box in Angerm√ºnde, Germany A bicycle parking station is a building or structure designed for use as a bicycle parking facility. Such a facility can be as simple as a lockable bike cage or shed or as complex as a purpose-built multi-level building: the common purpose is that they provide secure bicycle parking. Bicycle parking stations also go by names such as bike stations, bicycle centers and cycle centers, among many others. Bicycle parking stations can offer additional facilities such as bicycle repairs, and customer facilities such as showers or lockers. Some are staffed while others are not. Some require users to join as members while others are on a per use basis or completely free of charge. Some are based at railway stations to facilitate \\"bike and ride\\" multi-modal transport, while others are situated at the end of the commute and as such are located in town or city centres, universities, and workplaces. Advanced bicycle parking station provide protection from weather, thieves and vandalism not only for the vehicle but also for the helmets and other personal belongings. In order to use less floor space, they store the vehicles vertically, either in a kind of towers or under the floor in shafts. It is important that the access time is short, even if several users want to store or transfer their bicycles at the same time. Operation Bicycle parking stations are often operated by local governments or municipalities or they can be private businesses run by bike shops or non-profit bicycle advocacy organizations. Some are fully automated. Types There are several types of bicycle parking stations. Most bicycle parking stations are non-automatic, and the user usually leaves their bike at bicycle parking racks in the facility. These facility are usually sheltered or indoor, but unsheltered outdoor facilities also exist. Automatic bike parking stations exist in many forms, such as underground silos using automated storage and retrieval system. Services Bike stations may have several services connected to the facility. =Security= To prevent theft or vandalism, a bike station may have: * on-site staff during the day * a gate or door secured by key or by proximity card access. =Customer facilities= For the customer there may be additional services, such as: * lockers, changing rooms, * showers, bathrooms and toilets, * drinking fountains, * food and/or beverages, usually via vending machine * information available, such as pamphlets/brochures for bicycle safety, maps and other literature,e.g. about cycling routes or nearby points of interest. Some may even provide classes, e.g. bike maintenance or local area knowledge. =Bike services= Some bike stations (such as at many railway stations in the Netherlands) have staff who are able to carry out simple or complex repairs for a fee. This is very handy for commuters who can leave their bike there in the morning and pick it up fully repaired at the end of the day when on the way home. Regardless of whether repairs are available at a station or not, the station may also provide: * parts and accessories for sale * air pump for self-repair of flat tyres * bicycle rental. Pricing The most common pricing scheme for bike stations are: * a user pays service: the stations cost money to use, either through daily, weekly, monthly payments or through periodic memberships (though sometimes non-members can pay for daytime locker use). * free-of- charge service: the bike stations are usually fully paid for by the local municipality, local regional government, or by the operating company (e.g. for bicycle parking stations located at railway stations) * mixed system: some small charge may be required from the end-user (e.g. an administration charge) but the bulk of the operating costs are paid for by another entity.

A protagonist of natural vitamins, and a sturdy campaigner against processed foods and the health hazards of added chemicals ...\\" She wrote a number of books about nutrition, including Britain's Wild Larder: Fungi (1956), Herb Gardening (1967) and Everything You Should Know About Your Food (1978). Early life Claire was born in Berlin, Germany. Her parents were Arthur and Jeanette (n√©e Jacobi) Lewisohn. She married G√ºnther Emmanuel Loewenfeld (November 1895-January 1984) on 5 July 1921. They continued to live in Berlin in the period following their marriage. Gale Literary Databases - Claire Loewen feld, Accessed 28 August 2010 Both Claire and G√ºnther were from Jewish families; however, G√ºnther was brought up in the Protestant faith. Between 1923 and 1925 they spent their weekends with friends Fritz and Lily Pincus in a rented house, in Glienicke, on the outskirts of Potsdam. In 1925 the Loewenfelds and Pincuses moved out of Berlin to adjacent rented properties which they shared on the K√ºssel, a peninsula jutting out into Lake Templiner in a rural district of Potsdam. Both husbands commuted to Berlin to work. By 1931 Claire and G√ºnther had two children, Peter and Verena, likewise the Pincuses had two children. Both couples also had their relatives living with them from time to time and as more living space was needed they decided to buy their respective properties enlarging and linking them. Das Haus auf dem K√ºssel (The House on the K√ºssel) as it had become known was redesigned, to include both shared areas and private quarters, by a well-known Potsdam architect, Stephan Hirtzel.Pincus, Lily Verloren, gewonnen: Mein Weg von Berlin nach London, Deutsche Verlags- Anstalt, 1980 Another close friend of both families, Paul Tillich, a German- American Protestant theologian wrote a dedication on the inauguration of their new home entitled, (in English), Space and Time in Dwelling.Pauck, Wilhelm & Marion, Paul Tillich: His Life & Thought‚ÄìVolume 1: Life. New York: Harper & Row, 1976Tillich,Paul; Palmer, Michael F. Writings in the philosophy of culture Ch. 9 Das Wohnen, der Raum und der Zeit, De Gruyter, 1980 The Loewenfeld and Pincuses' house soon became a meeting place for Tillich and his circle of German intellectuals until Tillich, whose writings brought him into conflict with the Nazi movement, was subsequently forced into exile in the U.S.Tillich, Paul; Albrecht, Renate; and Hahl, Margot. Ein Lebensbild in Dokumenten, Walter de Gruyter, 1980.Tillich, Paul. My Travel Diary, 1936; Between Two Worlds. Harper & Row, 1970. During early 1936 the Loewenfelds travelled to Syria and Palestine where they witnessed at first-hand the initial stages of the Arab uprising against British mandate and Jewish immigration. They spent the summer of 1936 near Cortina in the Italian Dolomites where they met Tillich who was on a European lecture tour. In Tillich's diary an account of their time in Palestine records: > \\"While in Palestine, Claire and Guenther were in constant danger of their > lives. Once, the only thing that saved them was their Arab guide saying they > were German Nazis. Hitler is the big man with the Arabs. Mussolini gives > them money to spite the British.\\" From 1937 Claire and Lily's home in the K√ºssel provided a refuge for Jewish children, whose parents had been arrested or had been abandoned and were homeless. Claire's family continued to live in Germany until the latter part of 1938 when they left Potsdam because of the increasing likelihood of arrest. The Loewenfelds had made arrangements in advance for their belongings to be transported to England. In December 1938 both children, Peter and Verena were evacuated as part of the Kindertransport rescue mission travelling on board the SS Washington from Hamburg ato Southampton and then to an English boarding school, St Christopher School, Letchworth, Hertfordshire.Alien and Exemption from Internment - Refugee Records from 1939 Held by The National Archives, Kew HO 396/56/231 & HO 396/56/230 Meanwhile, G√ºnther joined relatives in England and Claire travelled first to Switzerland before rejoining her husband in early 1939. The family settled in rural Buckinghamshire in 1939.Note:-Loewenfeld listing in Cholesbury 1939 Register Career Rose hips are a particularly rich source of vitamin C During her time in Berlin in the 1920s Claire worked at an institute \\"providing slides and illustrations\\" for a university. In late 1938 Claire Loewenfeld studied at the Maximilian Bircher- Benner's clinic in Zurich, Switzerland obtaining a special diploma in nutrition. During the Second World War, she worked at the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children in London, England as a dietician. While there she specialised in the treatment of coeliac disease and successfully developed a new diet to treat it, based on Bircher-Benner's recipes, involving raw vegetable and fruit juice; she was also involved in longitudinal comparative studies assessing various treatments for the condition.Wyllie, W. G.; Payne, W.W.; and Beynon, D. W. \\"A Dietetic Approach to the Coeliac Affection\\", Arch. Dis. Child., 1951, vol 26, pp, 4-19, accessed 29 August 2009. During the war, Loewenfeld wrote to The Times and the British Medical Journal about the negative impact the shortage of fresh fruit and vegetables was having on the nation's health, and advocated the collection and distribution of rose hips from the hedgerows, as they provided \\"our highest home-grown source of Vitamin C\\". As a result, a leaflet she had prepared called Wild Rose Hips in War Time. Their Collection, Preparation and Use on how to exploit rose hips was immediately in huge demand. Over 18000 leaflets were sent by Claire to individuals as well as being widely distributed to schools and hospitals. In response, the government organised a nationwide initiative to collect roadside rose hips which, with the help of the Women's Institutes, were processed into syrup for babies and children. This was the first of several leaflets; there were an additional three under the title Wild Plants and Herbs, and three more grouped together under the heading Wild Fruits and Berries which were also distributed with the assistance of the newsagent WH Smith.(Loewenfeld and Beck 1974). See Introduction p.13 of Revised 1978 edition published after Claire's death Later life After the war, Claire set up Chiltern Herb Farm in Buckland Common, Buckinghamshire, with her husband, who before the war had practiced as an attorney and later had become a landscape architect. Her experience of using dried herbs to treat sick children during the war had made her aware that the standard preparation techniques resulted in material of poor nutrional value. Experimentation led to methods for producing dried herbs of higher quality which coincided with an increasing demand in Britain for such culinary products. She also gave lectures and demonstrations,The electrical journal, Volume 131 Retrieved, 03-09-2009 and wrote and collaborated on several books about healthy eating, herb gardening, and cooking with herbs and spices, some of which were also translated into German, Dutch and Spanish.WorldCat listing for Claire Loewenfeld Retrieved, 03-09-2009 She was a vegetarian and also promoted the benefits of Bircherm√ºesli, or m√ºesli as it is better known, which she learned the health benefits of while training at the Bircher-Benner Clinic. She translated into English the book by Ruth Bircher which also contained the original recipe for the cereal food (Bircher 1961). She was one of the first members of the Soil Association, advocating freshly prepared food and campaigning against the processing of food and addition of chemicals.Loewenfeld, Claire. British Medical Journal, 1 April 1978, volume 1, issue 6119. Claire was also a member of the women's volunteer organisation, Soroptimist International. Claire Loewenfeld died on 20 August 1974, and is buried at St Lawrence's Church, Cholesbury, Buckinghamshire, near where she lived, alongside her husband Gunther Loewenfeld's cousins, Margaret Lowenfeld and Helena Wright n√©e Lowenfeld.

He steadily rose through the academic ranks, and when the medical school became a four-year degree-granting entity in 1924 and built a university hospital, Middleton emerged as a central figure in the education of third- and fourth-year clinical clerks as well as house officers in internal medicine.

A novel and innovative program of \\"preceptorships\\" was initiated in 1926, wherein senior medical students were assigned to work with community practitioners throughout Wisconsin as a prelude to internship. That system of mentoring continues to this day. After the death of UW medical school Dean Charles Russell Bardeen in 1935, Middleton was named as his successor. The deanship was a difficult position at that time, because of growing factionalism among academic departments and their faculty members. In spite of that problem, the school flourished under Dean Middleton's guidance over 20 years. He continued to teach actively and to pursue his own research interests despite the administrative demands on his time, ultimately producing more than 300 contributions to the peer-reviewed medical literature. In 1939, the American Board of Internal Medicine was constituted under the aegis of the American Board of Medical Specialties. Middleton was asked to serve as one of the eight initial Board members, and was named Secretary-Treasurer of the organization. He was instrumental in formulating a national curriculum for residency training in internal medicine and a structured system of examination to achieve board-certification in that medical specialty.Middleton WS: The destiny of the American College of Physicians.

A garrison of a dozen French and 300 Laotian troops occupied a fortified outpost in the hills above the village of Muong Khoua, across the border from ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Ph·ªß. Muong Khoua was among the last French outposts in northern Laos following the decision of the French High Command to string several isolated garrisons through the region in order to buy time to fortify the major Laotian cities against Vi·ªát Minh attack. Many of these garrisons were given orders by radio to dig in and fight the approaching Vi·ªát Minh forces. Following the fall of a satellite strong point at Sop-Nao, the troops at Muong Khoua under Captain Teullier resisted a Vi·ªát Minh siege force for thirty-six days while supported by air-dropped supplies and air strikes. The small French force repelled several direct attacks and endured a series of artillery bombardments. Two of the three strong points of the outpost eventually fell in the early morning of May 18, and by midday the French force lay defeated. Four soldiers‚Äîtwo French and two Laotian‚Äîreached another French position away after six days of travel through the jungle, however no one else escaped. The resistance of the French garrison became a popular rallying cry for French troops in Indochina as well serving as a precursor to French and Vi·ªát Minh strategies at the decisive Battle of ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Ph·ªß the following year.Fall 1994, pp. 116‚Äì130. Prelude=Vi·ªát Minh in Laos= In early 1953, the Vi·ªát Minh under V√µ Nguy√™n Gi√°p commenced an invasion of Laos to exert additional pressure on Paris and on the French forces stationed in Indochina. In the area of Muong Khoua were the Vi·ªát Minh 308th, 312th and 316th divisions, whose long supply lines were maintained by a veritable army of 200,000 porters. The French command‚Äîheaded then by Raoul Salan‚Äîordered the establishment of a series of French outposts in northern Laos to resist the Vi·ªát Minh invading forces for as long as possible to buy time for the fortification of Luang Prabang and Vientiane, the capital cities of Laos. The King of Laos, Sisavang Vong, remained in Luang Prabang, which added greater impetus to French efforts. The terrain of northern Laos, and the local climate, isolated many of the outposts with a night-time fog known as crachin, thick jungle, a lack of roads, and steep terrain. Each outpost was given a certain number of days to withstand Vi·ªát Minh forces, including Muong Khoua which was issued orders on April 13 to hold for fourteen days‚Äîuntil April 27. Muong Khoua, together with its satellite outpost Sop-Nao, was under the command of Captain Teullier, with the satellite outpost being overseen by Lieutenant Gr√©zy. Muong Khoua was situated at the confluence of the rivers Nam Pak and Nam Hou, from ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Ph·ªß, and approximately to the south-west of the Black River in Vietnam. The outpost itself consisted of three separate strongholds, referred to as the Mousetrap, Pi and Alpha, situated on three hills to the west, south-south-east, and south-south-west of the confluence of the Nam Hou and Nam Pak. Each was roughly from the other, forming a triangle. The village of Muong Khoua itself lay at the western foot of the Mousetrap, protected from the river by a large sandbank, and straddling the road to Phong Saly, another French outpost to the north. =Sop-Nao= Sop-Nao lay to the east of Muong Khoua, along the path of the Vi·ªát Minh advance, roughly south- west of ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Ph·ªß and only a few miles from the Vietnam-Laos border, south of the T'ai Highlands. Gr√©zy, in command of the Sop-Nao garrison, led a reinforced platoon. On the evening of April 3, a Vi·ªát Minh battalion entered Laos near ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Ph·ªß and N√† S·∫£n and reached Sap-Nao. Finding themselves surrounded by the Vi·ªát Minh, the French at Sop-Nao stood for six days while in radio contact with Teullier at the main strong point. The survivors, following authorisation from the French captain, retreated during the night of April 9/10 along a round-about route following the assumption by Gr√©zy that the Vi·ªát Minh had laid ambushes along the most direct path. The French hacked a new path through the jungle until they reached Laotian tribesmen on April 11, who warned them of Vi·ªát Minh units following them. The French attempted to turn for Phong-Saly to the north and met an allied convoy travelling down the Nam Hou in canoes. The two forces combined and sailed down the river towards Muong Khoua. On April 12, the convoy ran into a Vi·ªát Minh ambush from the Muong Khoua strong point. Using a barrier of floating tree trunks, the Vi·ªát Minh attacked the convoy with machine guns and mortars, destroying the first canoe. The remaining French and Laotian troops returned fire and, with the assistance of forces from Muong Khoua who had heard the firing, routed the Vi·ªát Minh troops, who left behind 13 dead and four wounded. The French themselves suffered seven missing, one dead, and one wounded. The remainder joined the French at Muong Khoua, with the canoes and the convoy's equipment incorporated into the defence. Meanwhile, the Vi·ªát Minh's 910th Battalion of the 148th Regional Regiment of the 312th DivisionDavidson 1991, pp. 150‚Äì156. and a heavy mortar company from the 316th Division drew near. Battle=Siege= The Nam Ou River in northern Laos While the French troops from Sop-Nao were making their way via canoe to the mother strong point, Teullier and his forces were feeling what one chronicler referred to as l'asphyxie par le vide (\\"choking- off by creating a void\\"), the result of a Vi·ªát Minh presence in the area. The local villagers no longer spoke to the French, when they had previously been communicative, and the population began leaving; both the farms and the markets were deserted. The French viewed this as an indicator of imminent enemy attack. Furthermore, the thick jungle and steep slopes isolated the French strong points from all but river and airborne supply. The Vi·ªát Minh, on the other hand, were adequately supplied by over 200,000 porters, or coolies. Referred to officially as a \\"relatively small\\" force, the 300 Chasseurs Laotiens and \\"handful\\" of French NCOs and two officers were equipped with three 81-mm and two 60-mm mortars and two machine guns. They were ordered on April 13 to hold for fourteen days by Colonel Boucher de Cr√©vecoeur, who promised air support. At 23:00 hours that evening, April 13, mortar shells began landing on the slopes of position Alpha. These bombardments would take place every night, and the Vi·ªát Minh launched their first direct assault, which failed and left Vi·ªát Minh 22 dead. This defeat prompted a reversion to previous tactics of slowly \\"gnawing away\\" at the French outpost, and Giap ordered the 312th to leave some forces behind to continue a siege while the remainder of the division moved on. Meanwhile, overhead, French B-26s bombed Vi·ªát Minh positions, and cargo planes dropped supplies, Luciole (firefly) flares, and ammunition on the French positions.Fall 1994, pp. 122‚Äì127. This \\"air bridge\\" enabled the garrison to survive, and fourteen days later on April 27 it was still intact; the French High Command dropped a Legion of Honor for Teullier and several Croix de Guerres for his men. Teullier and a small group left the Mousetrap to deliver the relevant decorations to Pi and Alpha, although movement between the positions was extremely difficult. What was possible, however, was a small patrol through the village of Muong Khoua, which had been by now deserted. These French patrols served as an early warning system and an ambush for Vi·ªát Minh assaults during the crachin- dominated night. This pattern continued into May. Meanwhile, other French forces had liberated Xieng Khouang and reached a position from Muong Khoua. On May 17, the French patrol deployed to the Muong Khoua village overheard barking dogs‚Äîone of which yelped‚Äîalerting the French to an impending Vi·ªát Minh attack. By 23:00, the Vi·ªát Minh were visible in the fog, and the patrol returned to the Mousetrap. Teullier issued an alert via radio. A bombardment from Soviet Russian 120-mm mortars, 57-mm recoilless rifles, and phosphorus grenades began at 00:30 on May 18. Teullier instructed his radio operator, Sergeant Ren√© Novak, to request air-dropped flares and air support, while mortar fire landed on Alpha and the Mousetrap, but not Pi, where Gr√©zy was in command. Pi continued to support the other two areas of the outpost with its own mortar fire. By 01:10 hours, the western flank of the Mousetrap had fallen to Vi·ªát Minh bombardment. By 01:30, the garrison was informed that weather conditions prevented air support, and by 02:30 the Vi·ªát Minh forces launched successive assault waves which overran Teullier and his men, including attacks which flanked the position using the nearby sandbanks. At the same time, Alpha was overrun by Vi·ªát Minh forces, and by 03:50 no more firing was heard from the Mousetrap. Alpha survived the remainder of the night and was seen fighting by French aircraft at 09:00 that morning. C-47 transport aircraft returned to resume supply drops, however by 12:00 the Tricolor and the Laotian flag had been removed from Pi's command bunker. =Survivors= On May 22, four days after the fall of the Muong Khoua garrison, three of its soldiers‚Äîthe garrison radio operator Novak and two Laotians‚Äîreached the only remaining French outpost in northern Laos, Phong Saly. Bernard Fall recorded in Street Without Joy: \\"he was only twenty-five years old, but he looked fifty; he kept on walking like an automaton to the centre of the post before he was stopped by some of the men staring at him as at a ghost.\\"Fall 1994, p. 116. Novak and the two other soldiers had spent the four days moving through the jungle of Laos following the defeat of their unit. Two days later, Sergeant Pierre Blondeau also arrived at the outpost. His account detailed 57 hours spent hiding from the Vi·ªát Minh before a three-day march without food or navigational aids and then encountering native tribesmen who provided food and a pony, with which he reached the French forces. Aftermath The Vietnamese and French media had awarded considerable attention to the conflict, and newspapers worldwide had covered the battle. Bernard Fall made note of the significance of the battle as \\"epic\\" in both his 1961 Street Without Joy and 1967 Hell in a Very Small Place.Fall 1967, p. 73 The British newspaper The Times began covering the conflict on April 23, reporting the retreat from Sop Nao to Muong Khoua. However, despite correctly identifying half of the Vi·ªát Minh attacking force, it rated the garrison at the mother strong point as numbering 1,000. The battle received scant attention before the garrison fell, however after that garrison was defeated the coverage remained positive at the thought of French survivors and speculative on the future of the French military presence and new commander, Henri Navarre. The French High Command released an assessment of the defeat at Muong Khoua in Communique No. 14, stating \\"During the night of May 17 to 18, the post of Muong Khoua, which had victoriously resisted since the beginning of the Vi·ªát Minh offensive, succumbed under the overwhelming mass of assailants.\\"Fall 1994, p. 127. In January 1954, Muong Khoua was re-occupied by Laotian forces, which were subsequently overrun once more by the 316th Division of the Vi·ªát Minh. The Laotian commander, who lived in the village itself with his wife, was killed in his home before the attack. Battalions of the French Foreign Legion and Laotian forces suffered losses covering the retreat of garrison survivors. The area of Muong Khoua later became a critical supply route across Dien Bien Phu for the Vi·ªát Minh and by 1963 was the site of a construction project for the proposed Route 19.Langland, pp. 638‚Äì640. The French would use the lessons learned at Muong Khoua and those of the 1952 Battle of N√† S·∫£n in their defence plans at ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Ph·ªß, while the Vi·ªát Minh in turn would employ similar tactics of encirclement and strangulation there.Windrow 2004, p. 340. The importance of an air bridge to maintain supply lines, strong artillery support to stave off human-wave Vi·ªát Minh attacks, and the need for isolated emplacements to mutually support each other, were also important tactics taken on board by the French from both conflicts.Fall 1994, pp. 129‚Äì130. The disappearance of local civilian populations previously friendly towards the French, which served as a precursor to Vi·ªát Minh attack, was also remembered by the ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Ph·ªß troops. For the Vi·ªát Minh, their abilities to isolated and smother individual strongpoints while maintaining hidden artillery and support weapon emplacements out of the reach of French airstrikes and artillery were honed at both battles, as were their practices of using human-wave attacks.Windrow 2004, p. 109.

Stone Street has also been called Stonestreet in other racing publications and is named after a combination of his sire and dam's names. Stone Street Derby was trained by John W.

The colt is notable because he had not won any major stakes races before the Derby and did not win another major stakes race in his entire six year racing career after the Derby.[1] The 1908 Kentucky Derby was run on a wet track, with Stone Street easily creating an early lead over the other seven contenders, who were bogged down in the mud and were in poor racing form that day. The $5 minimum bet paid $123.60 to win for Stone Street at 24 to 1 final odds.

It is the first game in the Street Legal series. Gameplay The game takes place in the fictitious Valo City. There are four sections of the city, although only one is unlocked from the beginning of the game. Other parts of the city, as well as more available cars and upgrade parts, are unlocked by racing against CPU drivers. The cars in the game are all fictitious look-alikes of real vehicles. Examples are the \\"Ninja\\", a vehicle resembling a Honda Civic hatchback but bearing resemblance to other hatchbacks, and the \\"Badge\\", which mimics the Dodge Charger. The gameplay is highly mechanically-oriented - nearly every part on every car is replaceable. While the level of detail is not quite equal to that of the sequel game, Street Legal Racing: Redline, entire engines may be replaced and almost all body parts can be removed from the vehicle. Damage in the game is also highly detailed - unfortunately, there is no way to repair the entire car after it has been damaged, meaning that repairs are costly and require much time to make. Development The game, developed in 2002, has relatively advanced graphics for its time. However, the game's coding was written in a way which made it run slowly, even on computers which met the recommended system requirements. Patches have been written for the game which improve the game's performance greatly and reduce the number of bugs.

It is located at 300 East Church Street, between Mulberry and Railroad Streets. The building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 8, 1985 as the Barnesville Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Depot. History=Founding to Rails: 1808-1960= The village of Barnesville was platted in 1808 by James Barnes, who took advantage of a Drovers' road that ran through the area from the Ohio River. This road, as well as National Road, led to Barnesville being populated quickly. A railroad line was laid out through Barnesville in the middle 1850s and a wooden freight house was built close to the current location of the depot. Passenger service for the town was located in a corner room of the freight house until 1914, when the town was granted a depot by the B&O; Railroad. The depot was opened in 1916 and was heralded by the local newspaper as \\"long needed and greatly desired.\\"The Barnesville Enterprise, Years 1915-1920 Volume 1: November 9, 1916 The depot was the site of many city events, including troop send-offs during World War I, World War II, and the Korean War, as well as several Farmers' markets held on the site. =Decline: 1960-1984= The area surrounding the depot once consisted of manufacturers and warehouses like the Watt Car and Wheel Company and The Barnesville Glass Company, but has changed to mostly residential. The wooden freight house was demolished in 1962, leaving the depot as the only substantial building on the site. Besides the railroad tunnel west of the site, the depot is the only building in Barnesville relating to the important era of rail in the town. The last passenger departed the depot in 1961.The Barnesville Enterprise, Years 1960-1965 Volume 1: February 1, 1962 The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway took over the B&O; Railroad and operated the depot as offices and freight depot until 1983, when they vacated the \\"eastern division.\\" =Redevelopment: 1984-present= The building sat vacant and was primarily opened for the Barnesville Pumpkin Festival for exhibits on the early years of Barnesville and the history of the railroad and its impact on the town. The Barnesville Area Chamber of Commerce occupied the depot as offices from late 1990s until 2006, when they moved to a site in downtown Barnesville. The depot has been the center of activity as the Governor's Rails to Trails program will place a path along the old railway route from the depot to the east end of the town limits and may lead to an extension of the trail to the western limits as well.http://www.barnesvilleohio.com/rails.htm A pavilion was built beside the depot on the foundations of the old freight house and is the site of the Barnesville Farmers Market as well as events during the Barnesville Pumpkin Festival Appearance Side view with station sign viewed from Church Street. The depot is built in a Federal style with Spanish Mission elements. The building is a rectangular one-story structure built with buff red bricks in flemish bond with a stone watertable. The depot is surrounded by a brick road leading uphill to Church Street (the depot sits in a depression 30 feet lower than the city). Flat arched windows are double- sashed and contain either 6/6 or 4/4 panels and are set back from the exterior wall. A central door surrounded by a fanlight and side panels rest in the middle of the building. To either side of the door is a window and an unadorned pilaster. A double panel window lights either side of the building. The last 8 feet of the building then sets back from the footprint. The roof protrudes about 5 feet from the wall and is supported by solid molded brackets. The roof is tiled in a reddish colored clay. The roof is protruded by a Mission-style dormer, the window is surrounded by a pillar topped by a stone ball. The dormer rises in a step/curved pattern to an arch. The stylized window lights the waiting room below. The design of the depot reflects many others built by the B&O; Railroad during the early 1900s.

Allegations of Soviet involvement During the Cold War, in common with the larger World Peace Council and its affiliates, it was alleged that the USPC was a front group for Soviet interests, maintained close ties to the Communist Party USA, and was a mainstay of Soviet influence on the peace movement in the United States. The Peace Council held three days of organizational meetings at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., attended by approximately 275 to 300 people from thirty-three states, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union.

Career Boyd-Moss's career was relatively short owing to a series of setbacks: in 1984 (his first full season at Northamptonshire) he broke a thumb while playing, and then contracted hepatitis; a year later, back problems kept him out of action until mid-June; centuries against Lancashire and Glamorgan set him up for a successful season in 1986, only for his form to drop in the closing weeks of the season. Fitness problems restricted him to only half a dozen matches in 1987. Boyd-Moss's finest achievement is arguably his partnership with Geoff Cook in 1986, in which they scored 344 runs, breaking the Northamptonshire record for the highest second-wicket partnership. In 1982, Boyd-Moss and Kapil Dev hit 182 runs off of Derbyshire's front line bowlers in just 98 minutes, speeding up their declaration, leading ultimately to an emphatic victory; Boyd-Moss had hit 137 in the first innings, following up with an unbeaten 80 in the second, matching his more illustrious batting partner shot for shot.

Two years later, on April 20, 1823, Green was ordained priest. He became the rector of St. John's Church in Williamsboro, North Carolina, where he remained for four years. He then moved to Hillsborough, where he was rector of St. Matthew's Church until 1837. In that year, he was appointed chaplain and professor of belles-lettres at the University of North Carolina. He received the degree of D.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1845.Burrage & Stubbs, 1162 Bishop of Mississippi Green was elected in 1849 as the first bishop of the diocese of Mississippi.

He consecrated the Chapel of the Cross in 1852. He was among founders of the University of the South, at Sewanee, Tennessee, in 1860 and became its chancellor in 1867. The Episcopal Church in Mississippi grew under Green's leadership, increasing to thirty-three parishes by 1855.Sparks, 114 During the American Civil War, Bishop Green allied with the Episcopal Church in the Confederate States of America. The Battle of Jackson forced Green from the city, and he found the Church destroyed upon his return.Brinsfield, 224 In 1882, in ailing health, Green requested the aid of a coadjutor bishop, and Hugh Miller Thompson was elected to the position.

Written by Adam Ant and Marco Pirroni, the song was included on the band's 1981 album Prince Charming. It entered the UK Singles Chart in December 1981 at number 9 before rising to a peak position of number three. Music video The setting for the music video is Bodiam Castle and features Adam wearing a suit of armour in the style of the movie Excalibur (released the same year), then a blue American football uniform with the number 57 on the front. While in his football uniform, he crashes through a door, revealing Marco Pirroni sitting at a grand piano dressed as Liberace. Adam then does a Bruce Lee impersonation while rescuing the princess (played by Lulu) before being seen again in his armour. The video ends with Adam jumping from the top of the castle into the moat (the jump is actually performed by a stuntman). He throws his sword in the moat only to see an armoured hand lift it again from the water. Reception While widely panned by critics, \\"Ant Rap\\" was one of the earliest rap singles to chart in the UK, reaching number 3 on the UK singles chart. Paul Lester of The Guardian described \\"Ant Rap\\" as one of \\"the weirdest chart [hits] of all time: \\"Adam Ant is easily dismissed as pop pantomime, but his paeans to insects weren't just lyrically peculiar, they were examples of populist daring at its best, all yelps and Burundi beats - I'd single out his clattering Ant Rap as the weirdest of the weird, with extra points for reaching [number 3] with a song with no verse, no chorus, and a refrain comprising a list of the band members: 'Marco, Merrick, Terry-Lee, Gary Tibbs and yours tru-ly'.\\" The B-side of the single was a re-recording of \\"Friends\\". The band's former label, Do It Records, would release an early recording of \\"Friends\\" as a single in 1982. Lyrics Ant boasts of his success and his ability to dance, and calls out the anarchists of the music scene, affirming he was never concerned with receiving their \\"credibility\\". \\"Friends\\" It was fairly common for Ant to record new versions of his pre-1980 compositions for the B-sides of his singles. For this single, an old Ant song from 1978 called \\"Friends\\" was used. The song had enjoyed a short spell as part of the band's live set in the summer and autumn of 1978; it was recorded for the July 1978 Peel Session and an August 1978 demo at Decca Studios, and was one of three unused tracks from the Dirk Wears White Sox album sessions eventually released on The B-Sides EP in March 1982. In \\"Friends\\", Ant does a considerable amount of name-dropping in an attempt to be guestlisted. Among the people he claims as a friend include Shirley Bassey, late Beatle Stuart Sutcliffe, Michael Jackson, Michael Caine, John Wayne, Stevie Wonder, Eric Fromm and Bryan Ferry.

Walking sticks come in many shapes and sizes and some have become collector's items. People with disabilities may use some kinds of walking sticks as a crutch. The walking stick has also historically been known to be used as a defensive or offensive weapon and may conceal a knife or sword ‚Äì as in a swordstick. Hikers use walking sticks, also known as trekking poles, pilgrim's staffs, hiking poles, or hiking sticks, for a wide variety of purposes: to clear spider webs or to part thick bushes or grass obscuring their trail; as a support when going uphill or as a brake when going downhill; as a balance point when crossing streams, swamps, or other rough terrain; to feel for obstacles in the path; to test mud and puddles for depth; to enhance the cadence of striding, and as a defence against wild animals. Also known as an alpenstock, from its origins in mountaineering in the Alps, such a walking stick is equipped with a steel point and a hook or pick on top. One can improvise a walking stick from nearby felled wood. More ornate sticks are made for avid hikers and often adorned with small trinkets or medallions depicting \\"conquered\\" territory. Wooden walking-sticks are used for outdoor sports, healthy upper-body exercise, and even club, department, and family memorials. They can be individually handcrafted from a number of woods and may be personalised in many ways for the owner. A collector of walking sticks is termed a rabologist. Origin A classic late 19th century walking cane, sometimes also called a dress cane Around the 17th or 18th century, a stout rigid stick took over from the sword as an essential part of the European gentleman's wardrobe, used primarily as a walking stick. In addition to its value as a decorative accessory, it also continued to fulfil some of the function of the sword as a weapon. The standard cane was rattan with a rounded metal grip. The clouded cane was made of malacca (rattan stems) and showed the patina of age: Some canes had specially weighted metalwork. Other types of wood, such as hickory, are equally suitable. Accessories * The most common accessory, before or after purchase or manufacture, is a hand strap, to prevent loss of the stick should the hand release its grip. These are often threaded through a hole drilled into the stick rather than tied around. * A clip-on frame or similar device can be used to stand a stick against the top of a table. * In cold climates, a metallic cleat may be added to the foot of the cane. This dramatically increases traction on ice. The device is usually designed so it can be easily flipped to the side to prevent damage to indoor flooring. * Different handles are available to match grips of varying sizes. * Rubber ferrules give extra traction on most surfaces. * Nordic walking (ski walking) poles are extremely popular in Europe. Walking with two poles in the correct length radically reduces the stress to the knees, hips and back. These special poles come with straps resembling a fingerless glove, durable metal tips for off-road and removable rubber tips for pavement and other hard surfaces.

So did Fitzroy Simpson, the main suspect in \\"The Adventure of Silver Blaze\\" (1892), whose lead weighted stick was initially assumed to be the murder weapon. ;Makila (or makhila): Basque walking stick or staff, usually made from medlar wood.

American \\"walking canes\\" In North America, a walking cane is a walking stick with a curved top much like a shepherd's staff, but shorter. Thus, although they are called \\"canes\\", they are usually made of material heavier than cane, such as wood or metal. In the United States, presidents have often carried canes and received them as gifts. The Smithsonian has a cane given to George Washington by Benjamin Franklin. It features a gold handle in the shape of a Phrygian cap. In modern times, walking sticks are usually only seen with formal attire. Retractable canes that reveal such properties as hidden compartments, pool sticks, or blades are popular among collectors. Handles have been made from many substances, both natural and manmade. Carved and decorated canes have turned the functional into the fantastic. An unidentified woman in a soda fountain, pouring distilled alcohol into her drink from a walking stick during Prohibition in the United States, circa 1922. Some walking canes are crafted to hold and conceal a glass vial or flask of liquor accessible from the handle: referred to as a smuggler or flask walking cane The idea of a fancy cane as a fashion accessory to go with top hat and tails has been popularized in many song-and-dance acts, especially by Fred Astaire in several of his films and songs such as Top Hat, White Tie and Tails and Puttin' On the Ritz, where he exhorts \\"Come, let's mix where Rockefellers walk with sticks or umbrellas in their mitts.\\" He danced with a cane frequently. Some canes, known as \\"tippling canes\\" or \\"tipplers\\", have hollowed-out compartments near the top where flasks or vials of alcohol could be hidden and sprung out on demand. When used as a mobility or stability aid, canes are generally used in the hand opposite the injury or weakness. This may appear counter-intuitive, but this allows the cane to be used for stability in a way that lets the user shift much of their weight onto the cane and away from their weaker side as they walk. Personal preference, or a need to hold the cane in their dominant hand, means some cane users choose to hold the cane on their injured side. In the U.S. Congress in 1856, Charles Sumner of Massachusetts criticized Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois and Andrew Butler of South Carolina for the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act. When a relative of Andrew Butler, Preston Brooks, heard of it, he felt that Sumner's behavior demanded retaliation, and beat him senseless on the floor of the Senate with a gutta- percha walking cane.

Although this event is commonly known as \\"the caning of Senator Charles Sumner\\", it was not a caning in the normal (especially British) sense of formal corporal punishment with a much more flexible and usually thinner rattan.

Background Honduras had a history of several coups d'etat and military governments during the second half of the twentieth century. A civilian government was elected in 1981, but human rights violations continued. The military unit Battalion 3-16, which received training and support from the United States Central Intelligence Agency both in Honduras and at U.S. military bases and in Chile during the presidency of the dictator Augusto Pinochet.,Equipo Nizkor, LA APARICION DE OSAMENTAS EN UNA ANTIGUA BASE MILITAR DE LA CIA EN HONDURAS REABRE LA PARTICIPACION ARGENTINO-NORTEAMERICANA EN ESE PAIS., Margen carried out political assassinations and torture of suspected political opponents of the government. Amnesty International estimated that at least 184 people were \\"disappeared\\" from 1980 to 1992 in Honduras, most likely by the Honduran military. Creation According to COFADEH, people from 69 families in Honduras were disappeared in 1982. At the end of the year, 12 families, including Bertha Oliva de Nativ√≠, whose husband Professor Tom√°s Nativ√≠ was disappeared in 1981, created COFADEH.COFADEH, Quienes Somos, accessed 26 July 2009 COFADEH became a legally recognised organisation in 2001. Aims COFADEH states that its original aim was to get back their disappeared family members alive. It says that this has been achieved in some cases, but not for the majority. It claims that \\"between 1980 and 1989 at least 184 persons disappeared without any investigation carried out by the state nor with any conviction of [those] responsible.\\" Since then it has extended its aims to include other severe violations of human rights, promotion and education of human rights, and \\"investigation and legal documentation of cases\\". Threats against COFADEH members COFADEH states that Bertha Oliva de Nativi, other members of COFADEH and their families have \\"been a target of constant threats\\", stating that \\"Almost all of them have received threats, some have been assaulted, kidnapped and followed.\\" Amnesty International states that Bertha Oliva received \\"two death threats\\" on 27 January 2009 and an \\"act of surveillance\\" on 11 March 2009. On 22 September 2009, following the return of elected president Manuel Zelaya to Honduras during the 2009 Honduran constitutional crisis, 15 police under the responsibility of de facto president Roberto Micheletti fired tear gas canisters at the COFADEH office in Tegucigalpa, at a moment when about 100 people were in the COFADEH office. Amnesty International stated that the attack occurred when a large number of people were at the COFADEH office to report human rights violations that had occurred earlier that day. Interactions with international human rights organisations COFADEH was interviewed in June 2002 by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees regarding whether or not Battalion 3-16 still existed.

Its small population is almost completely dedicated to the pilgrims who come to visit the Sanctuary of Chalma, the second most-important pilgrimage site in Mexico. The sanctuary is dedicated to an image of what many people describe as a \\"black Christ\\" on a cross that legend says miraculously appeared in an area cave where the worship of a deity commonly known as Oxtoteotl used to take place. Actually, Oxtoteotl is an aspect of Tezcatlipoca, the \\"Smoking Mirror,\\" and the \\"black Christ\\" is really Tezcatlipoca, which the Spanish friars superimposed on the existing representation of Tezcatlipoca in order to convert the natives. Pilgrimages to this Christian sanctuary follow many of the patterns of the prehispanic rituals, including walking the narrow paths to the town itself, bathing in the waters of a special fresh-water spring and dancing at the sanctuary. Appearance of the Christ Image Main altar with image of the Christ of Chalma Prior to the Conquest, the small caves in the Chalma area were thought to be holy, and all caves came under Tezcatlipoca, the \\"Smoking Mirror,\\" the representative of the Mexica night. The aspect of Tezcatlipoca associated with caves was Oxtoteotl (also: Ostocteotl, Ostoteotl, Ostoctheotl) which has been translated as ‚Äúthe Dark Lord of the Cave,‚Äú though there is little agreement on how to translate this term. Francisco de Florencia, in his 1689 chronicle of the place (the earliest written source available on the subject) suggested the name Ostoc Teotl, but also said that his indigenous sources were unsure of the identity of the deity. Francisco de Florencia, Descripcion Historical, y Moral del yermo de San Miguel, de las cvevas en el Reyno de la Nueva-Efpa√±a, y invencion de la milagrofa Imagen de Chrifto nueftro Se√±or Crucificado, que fe venera en ellas(Cadiz: Imprenta de la Compa√±ia de Iefus, 1689) In one of the caves, it was said to be a large, man-sized, black, cylindrical idol of Oxtoteotl with reputed magical and healing powers. Oxtoteotl was a god of human destiny or of night, sometimes appearing as a jaguar or with the god of war, depending on different oral traditions. Those who made pilgrimage to the deity walked for days in the surrounding mountains, wearing flowers and carrying incense burners. After arriving to the site, they bathed in the nearby river fed by a sacred spring and drank holy water before entering the cave. There were also signs that worship of this deity included human sacrifice.Francisco de Florencia, Descripcion Historica, y Moral del yermo de San Miguel, de las cvevas en el Reyno de la Nueva-Efpa√±a, y invencion de la milagrofa Imagen de Chrifto nueftro Se√±or Crucificado, que fe venera en ellas (Cadiz: Imprenta de la Compa√±ia de Iefus, 1689), 5 ; Juan de Grijalva, Cr√≥nica de la Orden de NPS Agust√≠n en las provincias de la Nueva Espa√±a: en cuatro edades desde el a√±o de 1533 hasta el de 1592 (Mexico City: Editorial Porr√∫a, 1985). In approximately 1537,Francisco de Florencia Augustinians, including Brothers Sebastian de Tolentino and Nicolas Perea came to evangelize the Malinalco region of which Chalma is part. From there, the story has a number of versions. Most state that after learning about and perhaps seeing the rites associated with the worship of Oxtoteotl, Tolentino and Perea worked to evangelize here, urging the local people to destroy the idol. Then, three days later, the friars returned to destroy the idol themselves, but instead found a life-sized image of a crucified Christ in the space that the idol, which was found in pieces on the ground, previously occupied. Upon seeing the image, the indigenous people are said to have fallen down in ‚Äúapostolic piety,‚Äù which allowed for the conversion of the people of this area. A less-popular version of the story states that a muleteer was looking for one of his animals when he found the Black Christ in one of the caves.Esquibel y Vargas, Agustin Francisco. El Fenix de el Amor: Mexico: Imprenta de la Bibliotheca Mexicana, 1764. The cave in which the Christ image was found became a very popular Christian pilgrimage site starting from the 16th century. In 1643, a primitive church was constructed in a nearby plain. The Augustinian order administered the cult and chapel for many years, before deciding to construct a monastery and buildings to house the pilgrims who came to worship. By the end of the Colonial period, the complex was known as the Royal Convent and Sanctuary of Our Lord Jesus Christ and Saint Michael of the Caves of Chalma.Noguez, Xavier. \\"Chalma.\\" In Dav√≠d Carrasco (ed). The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures. : Oxford University Press, 2001. At many indigenous shrines in Mexico, the previous sacred images were replaced with Christian ones, occasionally made of a corn paste called ‚Äútatzingueni‚Äù using a technique developed by Vasco de Quiroga, and a number of these figures still exist. After the supposed appearance of the Black Christ figure, the Augustinian friars proclaimed a miracle had occurred in the cave, word of which spread and even included the idea that the area had been freed of predatory animals. The sanctuary complex Nave of the sanctuary church The veneration of the black Christ of Chalma continued to be performed in the cave where it was found until 1683, when the Augustinian Brothers Bartolome de Jesus Maria and Juan de San Jose founded a monastery at the cave site to attend to the many pilgrims. The image was brought to a church built especially for it on the canyon floor below the cave in which it was found, becoming the first sanctuary of Chalma. This sanctuary has been rebuilt and remodeled a number of times, with the most significant rebuildings in 1721 by Brother Diego Velazquez de la Cadena, and in 1830. The sanctuary‚Äôs official name is ‚ÄúEl Convento Real y Sanctuaria de Nuestro Se√±or Jesus Christo y San Miguel de los Cuevas de Chalma (The Royal Monastery and Sanctuary of Our Lord Jesus Christ and Saint Michael of the Caves of Chalma) authorized by Charles III of Spain in 1783 and was put directly under his protection. View of part of sanctuary from just below the Plaza of the Dancers The sanctuary consists of the church, the 17th century ex-monastery, caves and lodgings on the ridges around the town. The lodgings are primarily used during feast days when the area is packed with pilgrims. A stucco gate marks the entrance to the sacred precinct. Here is a concrete plaza in front of the church where mariachi players wait for requests and pilgrims on their knees can be seen. The facade and the interior of the sanctuary church are of Neoclassic design as a result of the last round of modifications. The inscription on the portal of the church reads \\"Venid a mi todos los que est√°is trabajados y cansados y yo os aliviar√©\\" (Come to me all you who are working and tired and I will give you rest). The church is filled with a number of paintings and sculptures with religious themes, most done in the 18th century, but the three main attractions are the image of the Christ of Chalma image itself, a sculpture of the Archangel Michel and a painting of the Virgin of Guadalupe.(1408mexdes) Other notable paintings include scenes from the lives of Saint Augustine and Saint Nicolas Tolentino and one of the Passion of Christ. The image of the Christ of Chalma inside the church contains silver offerings placed in 1534 by silversmith Agustin Villase√±or. However, it is not the original image that was supposedly found in the cave above. That image was destroyed by a fire in the 18th century, and the one that exists today is a recreation using what remained of the original after the fire. The altar is made of wood, painted in plateresque style, with an image of the Christ of Chalma in wood occupying the central space. A relatively recent cult has grown up around the ‚ÄúSanto Ni√±o del Consuelo‚Äù (Holy Child of Solace), which is an image probably created by a sculptor named Solache. For feast days such as Christmas and Epiphany, this image receives offerings of toys. Outside the church, on the path to the river is a space dedicated to the display of the folk paintings (called ‚Äúretablos‚Äù), photos, locks of hair and other tributes left in gratitude for miracles granted by the Christ of Chalma. The church of this sanctuary is one of the most crowded in the country year-round, attracting thousands of pilgrims who come because of the many miracles that have been attributed to the Christ of Chalma. Pilgrimage to the sanctuary Display area of \\"retablos\\" and other gifts left in appreciation of miracles received. The Sanctuary of Chalma is one of the most-visited pilgrimage site in Mexico, only second behind the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe. In fact, since the Christ image appeared ten years after the Virgin of Guadalupe, some consider her to be the ‚Äúmother‚Äù of this particular Christ figure. According to the Secretary of Tourism for Mexico State, more than two million people a year visit Chalma. Most visitors come from the Mexican states of Quer√©taro, Michoac√°n, Oaxaca, Guerrero and the Huasteca region in San Luis Potos√≠ and Veracruz; however, it also has received pilgrims from all over the world. Most pilgrimages to Chalma are communal in nature with different towns and villages in central Mexico having traditional days to visit the site. Most of these pilgrimages are for the blessing of the local patron saint or to commemorate the change of ‚Äúmayordomo,‚Äù a kind of lay religious leader in charge of a community‚Äôs religious traditions. From near or far, most communal pilgrimages are well-organized, such as the ‚ÄúProcession of Silence‚Äù that originates in Toluca. These pilgrimages can be planned a month in advance, with the mayordomo leading the organizational effort. Some parishes have tee shirts and special clothing produced for the pilgrimage, and others arrange to have colorfully decorated trucks to follow walking pilgrims for support functions. Before departure, all meet at a certain point in their hometowns. In the past, the pilgrimage from more local areas was done entirely by foot. Sometimes it is still done this way, but more often the trek is combined with motorized transport. Some others still have turned to bicycles as a means of transporting themselves to the site. The La Escondida or Chalma river as it passes by the sanctuary Whether they use other means to get to the Chalma area, modern pilgrims still follow the same narrow steep paths to the site that their ancestors used to get to the cave of Oxtoteotl and wearing flowers as they did. If the walk is done at night, pilgrims carry torches and candles. Before the 1970s the trip from the main highway to the village of Chalma could take eight hours or more by foot. Although there is now a paved road to the village, it is very winding through the rugged terrain. On the way, there are lodgings, some in private homes, for traveling pilgrims. Once arrived at the sanctuary, most pilgrims follow a number of traditional activities. One of the main purposes is to dance in the sanctuary complex. Traditional dances from all over Mexico are performed at this sanctuary, with some pilgrims dressed in the traditional clothing of their region. This dancing in honor of the Christ of Chalma is believed to cleanse sins. This ritual is so famous that in Mexico, there is a saying that when one asks for something impossible, they cannot perform the deed ‚Äúwithout going to dance at Chalma.‚Äù For many pilgrims, it is also important to visit a large, centuries- old Mexican cypress tree, next to which is a spring that emerges from the earth here. These are the same waters that pagan ancestors bathed in before the arrival of Christianity. For first-time pilgrims this visit is essential. The waters of the spring are claimed to have miraculous properties according to popular belief. First-time pilgrims must circle the tree three times. Many pilgrims ritually bathe themselves in these waters, and once clean, they are crowned with flowers to be ready to enter the sanctuary. Some people believe that not doing the ritual of the tree and spring will turn one into stone. On the tree, some pilgrims hang a small bag with newborn baby‚Äôs umbilical cord to give thanks for the birth and others hang notes and other items reflecting their petitions and prayers. Some women will place their hands in a hole in the tree where water comes out and place the water on their bodies for fertility. Inside the sanctuary itself, first-timers will have a sponsor (called a ‚Äúpadrino‚Äù) who presents the pilgrim to the image. Those who come bearing sacred images from their hometowns place them near the main altar of the church where mayordomos, or lay religious leaders will guard them for the duration, which can be up to one week. The most important ritual in the sanctuary is to approach the Christ image in the church, often on knees and kissing the protruded foot. Some leave votive offerings as well. When departing the sacred precinct, some walk backwards to the stucco gate, turning around after exiting. Mass pilgrimages occur during the first Friday of Lent, Holy Week and Pentecost as these dates are the most closely associated with the death of Christ. In addition, 1 July is the feast day of the Christ of Chalma. On these special days, as many as 50,000 pilgrims may arrive in Chalma. Such large numbers of visitors in a tiny town has caused problems. One recurring problem is with sanitation, and some poor pilgrims find the trip very expensive as food and lodging prices rise with the demand. This is especially true with fish meals during Lent. The most serious problem occurred in 1991 during Holy Week, when twenty people died and forty were injured when crowds pushed to gain access to the atrium of the sanctuary church. Most of the dead and injured were trampled. Today, a large number of security forces are present in Chalma during these times to prevent a repeat incident, as well as helicopters and ambulances to give medical attention to pilgrims. Many Mexican Catholics believe that 3 visits to Chalma are needed for petitions to the Christ here to be heard. The town of Chalma Chalma is a small community of 1701 people (as of the 2005 census), which is part of the municipality of Malinalco. It lies eleven km east of the municipal seat of Malinalco, 65 km from the state capital of Toluca and 95 km from Mexico City. The town is surrounded the dense vegetation, mountains, cliffs, glens, fresh- water springs and Chalma and Tlaxipehualco rivers. A number of these hills and cliffs are dotted with crosses, with some over 7 meters in height. These crosses supposedly scare evil spirits. Each cross belongs to a specific group of worshippers who take the crosses down to the sanctuary every year to paint and adorn them. Then they are taken back up to their place on the mountain side, and the ritual ends with singing and dancing, guarding the cross all night. In addition to the Sanctuary of Chalma, there are two other attractions in the small town. The first is the Agua de Vida (Water of Life) Park, built by the State of Mexico and intended to be a kind of prelude to the sanctuary itself. Next to the park are caves dedicated to God the Father, God the Son and the Holy Spirit. The Plaza de los Peregrinos (Plaza of the Pilgrims), was constructed with various levels, stairs, arches, terraces, a place to pray with the purpose of giving pilgrims a place to rest. Cultural and religious activities also take place here. It also features a mural in relief with religious themes. Festival days in the community of Chalma are distinguished by the construction of large panels decorated with colorful flowers and seeds. Local inhabitants make arches from tissue or crepe paper to decorate atriums, squares and streets. Almost all of Chalma‚Äôs small population makes its living from the pilgrimages, with the street leading to sanctuary completely filled with shops and street vendors, with no vehicular traffic allowed. Most of these vendors sell religious trinkets, plastic bottles for the spring water, and traditional Mexican cuisine.

History The Constitution gives Congress express power over the imposition of tariffs and the regulation of international trade. As a result, Congress can enact laws including those that: establish tariff rates; implement trade agreements; provide remedies against unfairly traded imports; control exports of sensitive technology; and extend tariff preferences to imports from developing countries. Over time, and under carefully prescribed circumstances, Congress has delegated some of its trade authority to the Executive Branch. Congress, however, has, in some cases, kept tight reins on the use of this authority by requiring that certain trade laws and programs be renewed; and by requiring the Executive Branch to issue reports to Congress to monitor the implementation of the trade laws and programs.This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. The authority of Congress to regulate international trade is set out in Article I, Section 8, Paragraph 1 of the United States Constitution: > The Congress shall have power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and > Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and to promote > the general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts and > Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States; The Embargo Act of 1807 was designed to force Britain to rescind its restrictions on American trade, but failed, and was repealed in early 1809. During the Civil War period, leaders of the Confederacy were confident that Britain would come to their aid because of British reliance on Southern cotton.U.S. Department of State, Office of the Historian Preventing Diplomatic Recognition of the Confederacy The Union was able to avoid this, through skillful use of diplomacy and threats to other aspects of European-U.S. trade relations. Near the end of the Second World War U.S. policy makers began to experiment on a broader level. In the 1940s, working with the British government, the United States developed two innovations to expand and govern trade among nations: the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the International Trade Organization (ITO). GATT was a temporary multilateral agreement designed to provide a framework of rules and a forum to negotiate trade barrier reductions among nations. The growing importance of international trade led to the establishment of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative in 1963 by Executive Order 11075, originally called The Office of the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations.International Trade and Investment art S.

United States trade policy has varied widely through various American historical and industrial periods. As a major developed nation, the U.S. has relied heavily on the import of raw materials and the export of finished goods. Because of the significance for American economy and industry, much weight has been placed on trade policy by elected officials and business leaders.

UK Guardian.. Retrieved on June 28, 2009. In 1985, the U.S. had just begun a growing trade deficit with China. During the 1990s, the U.S. trade deficit became a more excessive long-run trade deficit, mostly with Asia. By 2012, the U.S. trade deficit, fiscal budget deficit, and federal debt increased to record or near-record levels following the implementation of broad unconditional or unilateral U.S. free trade policies and formal trade agreements in the preceding decades. The US last had a trade surplus in 1975. The balance of trade in the United States has been a concern among economists and business people. Warren Buffett, founder of Berkshire Hathaway, was quoted in the Associated Press (January 20, 2006) as saying \\"The U.S. trade deficit is a bigger threat to the domestic economy than either the federal budget deficit or consumer debt and could lead to political turmoil... Right now, the rest of the world owns $3 trillion more of us than we own of them.\\" In both a 1987 guest editorial to the Omaha-World Herald and a more detailed 2003 Fortune article, Buffett proposed a tool called Import Certificates as a solution to the United States' problem and ensure balanced trade. \\"The rest of the world owns a staggering $2.5 trillion more of the U.S. than we own of other countries. Some of this $2.5 trillion is invested in claim checks‚ÄîU.S. bonds, both governmental and private‚Äîand some in such assets as property and equity securities.\\"America's Growing Trade Deficit Warren E. Buffett In 2013 the United States' largest trading partner was Canada. China has seen substantial economic growth in the past 50 years and though a nuclear-security summit that took place in early 2010 President Obama hoped to ensure another 50 years of growth between the two countries. On April 19, 2010, President Obama met with China's President Hu Jintao to discuss trade policies between the two countries. Though the US trade deficit has been stubborn, and tends to be the largest by dollar volume of any nation, even the most extreme months as measured by percent of GDP there are nations that are far more noteworthy. Case in point, post 2015 Nepal earthquake, Nepal's trade gap (in goods & services) was a shocking 33.3% of GDP although heavy remittances considerably offset that number. According to the US Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), January 27, 2017 report, the GDP \\"increased 4.0 percent, or $185.5 billion, in the fourth quarter of 2016 to a level of $18,860.8 billion.\\" In 2018, the year that a trade war with China was launched by U.S. President Donald Trump, the U.S. trade deficit in goods reached $891 billion, the largest on record. Customs territory The main customs territory of the United States includes the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the territory of Puerto Rico, with the exception of over 200 foreign trade zones designated to encourage economic activity. People and goods entering this territory are subject to inspection by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The remaining insular areas are separate customs territories administered largely by local authorities: * American Samoa * Guam * Northern Mariana Islands * United States Minor Outlying Islands (mostly uninhabited) * United States Virgin Islands Transportation of certain living things or agricultural products may be prohibited even within a customs territory. This is enforced by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the federal Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, and even state authorities such as the California Department of Food and Agriculture. Investment in the United States Gross U.S. assets held by foreigners were $16.3 trillion as of the end of 2006 (over 100% of GDP). The U.S. net international investment position (NIIP) became a negative $2.5 trillion at the end of 2006, or about minus 19% of GDP. This figure rises as long as the US maintains an imbalance in trade, when the value of imports substantially outweighs the value of exports. This external debt does not result mostly from loans to Americans or the American government, nor is it consumer debt owed to non-US creditors. It is an accounting entry that largely represents US domestic assets purchased with trade dollars and owned overseas, largely by US trading partners. For countries like the United States, a large net external debt is created when the value of foreign assets (debt and equity) held by domestic residents is less than the value of domestic assets held by foreigners. In simple terms, as foreigners buy property in the US, this adds to the external debt. When this occurs in greater amounts than Americans buying property overseas, nations like the United States are said to be debtor nations, but this is not conventional debt like a loan obtained from a bank. Account balance as of 2006Current account balance, U.S. dollars, Billions from International Monetary Fund World Economic Outlook Database, April 2008 If the external debt represents foreign ownership of domestic assets, the result is that rental income, stock dividends, capital gains and other investment income is received by foreign investors, rather than by U.S. residents. On the other hand, when American debt is held by overseas investors, they receive interest and principal repayments. As the trade imbalance puts extra dollars in hands outside of the U.S., these dollars may be used to invest in new assets (foreign direct investment, such as new plants) or be used to buy existing American assets such as stocks, real estate and bonds. With a mounting trade deficit, the income from these assets increasingly transfers overseas. Of major concern is the magnitude of the NIIP (or net external debt), which is larger than those of most national economies. Fueled by the sizable trade deficit, the external debt is so large that economists are concerned over whether the current account deficit is unsustainable. A complicating factor is that trading partners such as China, depend for much of their economy on exports, especially to America. There are many controversies about the current trade and external debt situation, and it is arguable whether anyone understands how these dynamics will play out in a historically unprecedented floating exchange rate system. While various aspects of the U.S. economic profile have precedents in the situations of other countries (notably government debt as a percentage of GDP), the sheer size of the U.S., and the integral role of the US economy in the overall global economic environment, create considerable uncertainty about the future. According to economists such as Larry Summers and Paul Krugman, the enormous inflow of capital from China is one of the causes of the global financial crisis of 2008‚Äì2009. China had been buying huge quantities of dollar assets to keep its currency value low and its export economy humming, which caused American interest rates and saving rates to remain artificially low. These low interest rates, in turn, contributed to the United States housing bubble because when mortgages are cheap, house prices are inflated as people can afford to borrow more. Trade agreements The United States is a partner to many trade agreements, shown in the chart below and the map to the right. The United States has also negotiated many Trade and Investment Framework Agreements, which are often precursors to free trade agreements. It has also negotiated many bilateral investment treaties, which concern the movement of capital rather than goods. The U.S. is a member of several international trade organizations. The purpose of joining these organizations is to come to agreement with other nations on trade issues, although there is domestic political controversy to whether or not the U.S. government should be making these trade agreements in the first place.

The book was translated into English by Ellen Kennedy in 1985 and published by MIT Press in 1988, based on the 1926 edition. In this book, Schmitt provides a critique of parliamentary democracy ‚Äì particularly as embodied in the form of the Weimar Republic ‚Äì and calls into question one of its central political institutions, the Reichstag.  Context  In Ellen Kennedy's introduction, she claims that The Crisis of Parliamentary Democracy has been commonly read to be \\"welcome to the broad spectrum of anti-parliamentary prejudices in the Weimar Republic\\" His critiques of parliamentary democracies undermined the legitimacy of the Reichstag in the Weimar Republic. Schmitt was closely identified with Political Catholicism in the first years of the Weimar Republic and his contact with Catholic political and intellectual circles made him the leading exponent of the Catholic view among German jurists. The second edition of his book was written particularly to address the critique of Richard Thoma's review and was shown in multiple publications including Hochland - through Karl Muth in 1926- and the second edition of his Parlamentarismus. This work is representative of Schmitt's focus at the time of developing a critique of his contemporary society and the history of political ideas, particularly of democracy, liberalism, and dictatorship.  Structure  The 1988 edition of the text has the following structure: # Preface to the Second Edition (1926): On the Contradiction Between Parliamentarism and Democracy # Introduction to the First Edition (1923) # Democracy and Parliamentarism # The Principles of Parliamentarism # Dictatorship in Marxist Thought # Irrationalist Theories of the Direct Use of Force # Appendix: On the Ideology of Parliamentarism (1925) by Richard Thoma  Preface to the Second Edition  In the preface to the Second Edition (1926), Carl Schmitt directly responds to Richard Thoma's 1925 critique of the first edition (Thoma's essay is included in the appendix.) Schmit further develops his original argument, reiterates the importance of distinguishing between democracy and liberalism, and explains that appeals to the utility or reliability of parliamentary democracy cannot serve to justify its intellectual foundations, even if pragmatic claims about parliamentary democracy might be empirically correct. Schmitt claims that every form of government ‚Äì monarchy, aristocracy, democracy, etc. ‚Äì rest upon some intellectual principle, and explains by way of example that monarchies rest upon the principle of honour. Analogously, Schmitt claims that \\"all specifically parliamentary arrangements and norms receive their meaning first through discussion and openness.\\" There are a whole range of constitutionally- recognised measures which would be totally unintelligible if this fundamental principle of openness and discussion was no longer believed in, from the independence of representatives from their constituents and political party and the immunity of representatives while speaking in parliament, to the basic principles of freedom of speech and the openness of parliamentary procedures. In Schmitt's view, these are all grounded in the principles of discussion and openness; if these foundational principles collapse, so too does the intellectual basis of parliamentarism; Schmitt therefore seeks to demonstrate that the principles of discussion and openness have collapsed and eroded as an explanation for the perceived corruption and decay of the liberal democracy of his time. Schmitt argues that \\"What numerous parliaments in various European and non-European states have produced in the way of a political elite of hundreds of successive ministers justifies no great optimism. But worse and destroying almost every hope, in a few states, parliamentarism has already produced a situation in which all public business has become an object of spoils and compromise for the parties and their followers, and politics, far from being the concern of an elite, has become the despised business of a rather dubious class of persons.\\" So on the one hand, this is a 'practical- technical hypothesis', which can be shown to be true or false based on evidence of whether it actually guarantees the best selection of political leaders. But the conviction, or belief in parliamentarism is also based on a more principled belief in discussion and openness. But this is likewise valid only insofar as public discussion is taken seriously and implemented. Discussion is not merely negotiation - it's about a conflict of opinions, with reasons given in order to persuade others of the truth or justice of one's own opinion, not a struggle of interest: \\"To discussion belong shared convictions as premises, the willingness to be persuaded, independence of party ties, freedom from selfish interests. Most people today would regard such disinterestedness as scarcely possible. But even this skepticism belongs to the crisis of parliamentarism.\\" Moreover, \\"Moreover, \\"In the history of political ideas, there are epochs of great energy and times becalmed, times of motionless status quo. Thus the epoch of monarchy is at an end when a sense of the principle of kingship, of honor, has been lost, if bourgeois kings appear who seek to prove their usefulness and utility instead of their devotion and honor. The external apparatus of monarchical institutions can remain standing very much longer after that. But in spite of it monarchy's hour has tolled. The convictions inherent in this and no other institution then appear antiquated; practical justifications for it will not be lacking, but it is only an empirical question whether men or organizations come forward who can prove themselves just as useful or even more so than these kings and through this simple fact brush aside monarchy.\\" Schmitt also argues that \\"Every actual democracy rests on the principle that not only are equals equal, but unequals will not be treated equally. Democracy requires, therefore, first homogeneity and second - if the need arises - elimination or eradication of heterogeneity.\\" Equality must always exist in some substantive form, and always entails its dialectical antithesis: inequality. In this early preface can therefore be found the foundations of the theory Schmitt later went on to more fully develop in his mature thought in The Concept of the Political in 1932.

The genus Arundo is native from the Mediterranean Basin to the Far East. The genus Arundinaria is a bamboo (Bambuseae) found in the New World. Neither genus includes sugarcane (genus Saccharum, tribe Andropogoneae). Cane commonly grows in large riparian stands known as canebrakes, found in toponyms throughout the Southern and Western United States; they are much like the tules (Schoenoplectus acutus) of California. Depending on strength, cane can be fashioned for various purposes, including walking sticks, crutches, assistive canes or judicial or school canes. Where canes are used in corporal punishment, they must meet particular specifications, such as a high degree of flexibility. Cane historically has been used for many other purposes such as baskets, furniture, boats, roofs and wherever stiff, withy sticks can be put to good use. Etymology The English word cane derives , , , and . Other uses A Cherokee river cane basket. Cane is used for a variety of artistic and practical purposes, such as Native American baskets of North America. During the 18th and early 19th century, non-commissioned officers in some European armies could carry canes to discipline troops (when not in use, the cane was hooked to a cross-belt or a button). Cane is used to describe furniture made of wicker. Cane also describes a length of colored, patterned glass rod used in caneworking, a style of glassblowing. Canes are used in regional folk-dancing and as props on stage. For example, folk-dancers may twirl canes overhead, stand them on the head, spin them off to the sides, or strike them on the floor.Cane in Dancing Explained Cane is used all around the world and can be used for weaving baskets for hampers, chairs with the use of seagrass to beautify it, for beds of different sizes for children and adult, cupboards, tables of different shapes and sizes and can also be used for walking sticks. it can also be used for boats and roofs according to history Canes are used in regional folk- dancing and as props on stage.

The walking stick has also historically been known to be used as a defensive or offensive weapon, and may conceal a knife or sword as in a swordstick. Walking sticks, also known as trekking poles, pilgrim's staffs, hiking poles or hiking sticks, are used by hikers for a wide variety of purposes: to clear spider webs, or part thick bushes or grass obscuring the trail; as a support when going uphill or a brake when going downhill; as a balance point when crossing streams, swamps or other rough terrain; to feel for obstacles in the path; to test mud and puddles for depth; and as a defense against wild animals. A collector of walking sticks is termed a Rabologist. Cane has been used since the olden days till modern age and it is producing and will continue to produce new products or materials for different purposes like, beautification for houses, offices, for external or internal use.

In 1805, a new church was built, designed by Architect Paulsson, named Saint Mary's Church, after Mariya Feodorovna, the mother of the tsar at that time, Alexander I. * After the annexation of Finland by Russia, the relationship with the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland became closer, and, during the early 1890s, the membership of the church reached 17,000. * As the Russian Revolution of 1917 came, the church went through the most difficult time. In 1938, the church was forced to stop functioning and the church building was first used as a residential space and later as a natural history museum. * After Perestroika, the church building was returned to the church.

The mayor and the other members of the Borough Council unsuccessfully attempt to bribe Otto and the act ends with the unexpected return of a long lost fiance of Euphony named Cardiff Joe from Wales. =Act II= In the second act, Cardiff Joe and Euphony plan a date for their wedding. Cedric returns to film a commercial for Otto's restaurant. Cardiff Joe makes an anonymous bomb threat against the highway on the same day as his wedding to Euphony. The mayor uses the hat implicating Euphony as \\"The Mysterious Stranger\\" to force Otto into allowing the highway. The play ends with Franco and Sumintra joining Cedric and Drusilla on a live broadcast of the six o clock news. Wordplay In Act One, Otto complains about a sign painter's mistake in writing \\"DRIVE-IN FAST, FOOD SERVICE\\" instead of \\"DRIVE- IN, DASH, FAST FOOD SERVICE\\". Following a crash involving Cedric, Franco notes \\"So you're in a coma because of a comma.\\" In a later section, Franco responds to an argument over the use of \\"I'm\\" versus \\"I am\\" with the line \\"Well, let's not go into a coma over a comma.\\" The chef, Sumintra, begins most of her lines with \\"because\\", and Euphony and Franco discuss her resignation: > EUPHONY: Sumintra has resigned. She too insubordinate. > FRANCO: You find so? She began each sentence with a subordinate clause. The play abounds with similar word play. Undeveloped plot lines Over the course of the play, certain sideplots are cut short or ignored, leaving them open to the imagination. Among these unresolved elements of the story are how Alwyn met the Deacon (and, more generally, who the Deacon actually is) and what happened to the two bandits in their later enterprise. Similarly, themes essential to the play: prejudice on the basis of language, largely coming from Franco, and racial prejudice, largely directed against Lai Fook, are introduced but rapidly discarded. 1981 plays Plays by Derek Walcott ","title":"Beef, No Chicken"},{"id":"23794802","text":":Not to be confused with Tell Me Mamma (1964) as performed by Christine Quaite and Patty Duke Tell Me Momma is a song written by Bob Dylan and performed exclusively during his 1966 World Tour with the Band (then known as the Hawks).

Because enhancing a mitzvah by performing it with an especially beautiful object is considered a praiseworthy way of honoring God's commandments, Judaism has a long tradition of commissioning ritual objects from craftsmen and artists.Kanof, Abram (1982). Jewish Ceremonial Art and Religious Observance. New York: Abrams. .  Textual origin  Judaism has a set of classical early rabbinic commentaries on the Hebrew Bible; these commentary collections are known as the midrash literature. Midrash Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael has this teaching on a biblical verse: Other Midrash teachings (e.g. Shir HaShirim Rabbah 1.15) offer the same idea. This idea is expanded upon in the Babylonian Talmud (e.g. BƒÅ·∏áƒÅ QammƒÅ 9b). This teaching was understood by succeeding generations as a duty, when possible, to make beautiful items used in Jewish life and worship, both physical and textual.  Items used on Shabbat  The following items are used during Shabbat: *Kiddush cup: Kiddush, literally, \\"sanctification,\\" is a blessing recited over wine or grape juice to sanctify the Shabbat and Jewish holidays. Kiddush cups are highly decorated, and are generally made of china, porcelain, silver, pewter and nickel. *Shabbat candlestick holders *Hand washing cup (\\"netilat yediam\\") *Challah cutting board and cover *Havdalah candle and candle holder *Havdalah spice box Havdalah candle holder and spice box The close of the Jewish Shabbat is marked by the brief prayer ceremony of Havdalah, which usually takes place in the home. Part of the ceremony requires sniffing a sweet-smelling spice or plant. In Jewish communities around the Mediterranean, a sprig of a sweet- smelling shrub was customarily used, in Northern Europe by the twelfth century there are literary references of the use of a specially designed spice box or container. The oldest surviving spice boxes for Havdalah date to the mid- sixteenth century. The Jewish Museum (New York) has a German example c. 1550 thought to originate in Frankfurt am Main.\\"Spice Container\\". The Jewish Museum. thejewishmuseum.org.

Oliver Stone, director of the 1991 film JFK called it \\"a breakthrough exploration of Kennedy and his generals, [which] defines the 1961-1963 period in a light I never understood before\\". Arthur M.

It was used most prominently to showcase the local coal mining industry. During its brief history President Benjamin Harrison and Congressman William McKinley visited the building, but a decline in attendance and nature's toll on the building's exterior ultimately resulted in the building's demolition in 1892. Background Although Iowa is most known for its rich soil and subsequent agriculture industry, Iowa had a thriving coal mining industry throughout the last half of the nineteenth century. Bituminous coal deposits, formed during the Pennsylvanian subperiod, are found throughout much of south-central Iowa, and demand for coal in Iowa grew steadily as railroad construction moved westward. By 1870, several railroad lines stretched across the state, each requiring a constant supply of coal.Schwieder, p. xi. The opening of hundreds of coal mines across southern Iowa coincided with industrialization and the popularity of local expositions designed to showcase agriculture, commerce, and industry. An unusual trend emerged from this confluence in Iowa: massive and opulent but temporary exhibition halls were built to house these expositions, and each was a lumber structure featuring walls veneered with the material being celebrated. Following the Corn Palace in Sioux City, the Blue Grass Palace in Creston, and the Flax Palace in Forest City, the city of Ottumwa attempted to capitalize on its largest industries with a palace of its own‚Äîthe Coal Palace. Funding and construction The brainchild of three prominent citizens‚ÄîColonel Peter G. Ballingall, Calvin Manning, and Henry Phillips‚Äîthe Coal Palace was first conceived in late 1889, at which time the Ottumwa Coal Palace Company was established with stocks available for $5 per share. Initially very few shares were purchased; only when an emergency meeting was called among Ottumwa's business leaders, at which Peter G. Ballingall offered to purchase $700 in shares, was interest seriously revived. Eventually 395 citizens subscribed (the top subscriber was Thomas D. Foster, manager of the Morrell meatpacking plant, with $1,000), and the company had secured more than $30,000.Waterman, p. 96. Construction began in the summer of 1890 on a lot donated by Ballingall known as the Sunken Park. The park had previously been a bed of the Des Moines River but was essentially made a slough by the constructed embankment of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, and Ballingall had since transformed the area into a park. Ten area counties‚ÄîAppanoose, Davis, Jefferson, Keokuk, Lucas, Mahaska, Marion, Monroe, Van Buren, and Wapello‚Äîdonated coal for the construction, and each county created an exhibit for the exposition. Approximately 300 piles were used to bring the ground floor to street level and create the structure's foundation.Appleton, p. 140. From there more than of lumber in solid sheets was used to form the framing. Coal was veneered onto the walls and fused with black mortar, effectively giving the building the look of a medieval stone-clad castle. For the second floor, lighter and smaller forms of bituminous coal‚Äînut and pea‚Äîwere used, and the roof was coated with highly reflective vitric coal and red mortar. Vitric coal was also used to spell \\"Coal Palace\\" above the main entrance.Shaffer, p. 25.Garvin, p. 203. Architecture Sioux City architect Charles P. Brown was contracted to design the Coal Palace; he had previously designed the first Corn Palace in Sioux City and was at the time planning the second.Gebhard and Mansheim, p. 335 Born in Salem, Massachusetts, Brown moved to Sioux City in 1886 and had designed much of its downtown.Beitz, p. 43. =Exterior= The exterior from the east. Brown recognized the inherent medieval quality of walls covered in uncut coal and capitalized on this theme by adding turrets, crenellated walls, and spired roofs. Ten flags with the names of the ten coal-donating counties adorned the roof, along with two Coal Palace flags and two large American flags. The primary entrance to the building was through two archways along the northern side, though four semi-circular turrets on the ground floor also contained doors. The Ottumwa Daily Courier remarked on the completed exterior's artistic detailing in 1890: Numerous friezes along the exterior walls reflected both neoclassicism, still strong in the late nineteenth century, and local industry. Among the designs either carved into coal or fancifully painted along the outer walls were a head of Ajax, a series of lions' heads festooned with produce, a depiction of the Carboniferous period connected to a modern coal mine by a miner and pickaxe, and several medallions celebrating local trades‚Äîblacksmithing, lumbering, plumbing, masonry, farming, machining, and carpentering were all visible. The smallest turrets were adorned with silver and black stripes, while two gables above the second floor depicted the goddess Ceres watching over farmers and Vulcan watching over factories. After dusk, arc lamps in the towers and colored, electric lights in the windows lit the structure to make \\"the scene more splendid than any illuminated castle of the rich barons of the middle ages.\\"Ottumwa Daily Courier, date and author unknown, qtd. in Beitz, p. 44. The eastern portion of the sunken park (extending to Washington Street) remained a garden, though several landscaping features (fountains, walking paths, and exotic foliage) were added.Kneedler, p. 717. =Interior= All interior decorations were overseen by D. E. Milward and D. S. Clark of Sioux City, two men who had previously designed the Corn Palace. The interior of the Coal Palace was no less ostentatious then its exterior. The pillars, rafters, railings, and ceilings which supported the upper floor were largely covered by decorations of barley, blue grass, clover, corn, flax, millet, oats, rye, timothy, and wheat‚Äîall native and common to Iowa. Along with lavish displays created by the Iowa counties who had donated coal to construct the Coal Palace, several area businesses and organizations also created displays, including the Morrell Meat Packing Company, T. M. Sinclair & Co. of Cedar Rapids, R. T. Davis Mill Company of St. Joseph, Missouri, the Northern Pacific Railway, the P.E.O. Sisterhood of Ottumwa, Pi Beta Phi, and the Blue Grass Region of Iowa (a consortium of 21 counties in southwestern Iowa). Several prominent citizens also donated historical objects and curiosities.Rouse gives an extended, romantic description of the interior exhibits of the Coal Palace from pp. 280‚Äì344 The exhibits surrounded the central portion of the hall, which contained a large auditorium and stage. Behind the stage stood a waterfall lit by 700 lights and which fell . It required approximately of water daily. Half of the water landed in a lake a further 15 feet below, while the other half navigated a series of boulders and escarpments. A suspension bridge and live spruces and firs completed this effect.Beitz, p. 44. The seating capacity of the auditorium was estimated to be as high as 8,000. The central tower featured an observation gallery and dance floor, and could be reached from the main gallery floor by two elevators or a flight of stairs. From the gallery visitors could be lowered into what was perhaps the Coal Palace's most unusual feature: a miniature, working coal mine beneath the main floor. Taking advantage of the sunken park, this coal mine tour was led by a mule and allowed visitors to observe the coal mining process as miners dug into actual coal.Anderson, p. 255. Expositions The Coal Palace was opened once yearly for a month-long exposition and festival in September and October. The expositions were enthusiastically promoted by the subscribers of the company, each of whom received a metal medallion for their financial support. =1890= In 1890 the Coal Palace officially opened on September 16 and closed on October 11. On opening day, a parade proceeded to the Palace at 1:30 p.m. with Governor Horace Boies, the mayor of Ottumwa, Company G of the Iowa National Guard, and the Iowa State Band leading the way. The governor spoke at length of the thriving coal industry in Iowa, which he lamented was too often overlooked in a state with such a rich agricultural history. The opening of the Coal Palace and the governor's speech were reported in The New York Times. The Coal Palace organizers arranged special celebration days to boost attendance‚ÄîDes Moines Day, Missouri Day, and days for each of the surrounding counties each brought thousands of tourists and visitors. But the busiest day at the Coal Palace in 1890 was October 9, when President Benjamin Harrison spent the day in Ottumwa. At approximately 10:00 a.m. he toured the Coal Palace privately and spoke at the exposition before an estimated crowd of 40,000Hedges, p. 255. people in the afternoon: A few minutes after this portion of the speech the waterfall began, and Harrison's voice was briefly drowned out (Harrison suspected the waterfall was turned on by a political opponent).Garvin, p. 205 Harrison remained in the Palace that evening and shook hands with nearly 10,000 visitors. When the exposition closed two days later, it was deemed an enormous success, and the company voted to keep the palace standing for use next fall. =1891= Peter G. Ballingall departed for a trip to China in late 1890, and word later reached Ottumwa that he had died suddenly near Hong Kong on March 7, 1891. His funeral was held in the Coal Palace on April 14, with Governor Boies among the attendees. The death of the chief planner and president of the Ottumwa Coal Palace Company created a hitch among the exhibition planners, but the exposition would go on regardless, with Russell A. Alger, John C. Black, and William McKinley slated to give speeches during the celebration.Beitz, p. 45 The festival opened with a parade on September 15, and the largest attendance came on September 23, when an estimated 30,000 to 50,000 people came to hear William McKinley, who spoke from Ottumwa's Central Park to ensure everyone could see and hear him. And although John C. Black drew nearly as many Democratic visitors on October 7 (which was \\"Democratic Day\\" at the Coal Palace), enthusiasm generally declined for the 1891 festival. The Coal Palace closed on October 10.The closing date is visible on a commemorative coin produced for the second season. Legacy Following the 1891 exposition, the Coal Palace was razed in 1892. Its location is now home to Ballingall Park in Ottumwa, a part of the city willed by Ballingall for use as a park \\"forever.\\" Coal mining in Iowa is no longer a major industry. Despite this, the Coal Palace remains a legendary part of Ottumwa history, arriving (and departing) at a time when Ottumwa was often referred to as the \\"Lowell of the West.\\" Manufacturing remains a major part of Ottumwa's economy. In 1998, a miniature replica of the Coal Palace was completed by local historian Milly Morris-Amos, and it is visible today in the Wapello County Historical Museum.

It is the last novel in the Cadfael Chronicles, first published in 1994. When a rebellion arises in the north, Cadfael leaves the cloister to save two who are dear to him. One is the son he has not yet acknowledged, held prisoner by a disillusioned knight. The novel received strongly positive reviews when it was published, and some noted the increasing sales of books in the series. It was \\"moving and suspenseful\\", \\"one of Cadfael's most moving adventures\\". Introduction to plot After eight years, The Anarchy moves into stalemate, as fighting continues in the Thames valley. In the Holy Land, Edessa has fallen, giving rise to a strong desire among bishops in England to end the civil war and redirect fighting men towards another Crusade to keep Jerusalem safe. In the late summer of 1145, the younger son of Robert of Gloucester, Philip FitzRobert, switches sides, yielding his castle at Cricklade to King Stephen. Philip's castellan at Faringdon, Brian de Soulis, quickly follows his example, surrendering his castle to Stephen's besieging forces. Not all the garrison of Faringdon agree to change sides, and thirty men are taken hostage. Robert, Earl of Leicester is given a list of the thirty men and their captors, but one man among Faringdon's garrison is unaccounted for: Olivier de Bretagne. Plot summary In November 1145, Robert sends a copy of the list to Hugh Beringar, Sheriff of Shrewsbury, along with news that the two factions will meet for a peace conference at Coventry. Earl Robert asks Hugh to attend. Not seeing Olivier's name among the men being offered for ransom, Hugh tells Cadfael, who tells Abbot Radulfus that he feels it is his duty to rescue his son Olivier, at the risk of breaking his vows. Radulfus allows him to accompany Hugh to Coventry. Beyond that, Cadfael is on his own. In Lichfield's chapel, Cadfael recognises Yves Hugonin, Olivier's brother-in-law. Riding to Coventry, barely have they entered the town when Yves draws his sword and flies in rage at Brien de Soulis, the turncoat castellan of Faringdon. Order is restored by Bishop Roger de Clinton. Yves is called to a private audience with the Empress Maud. She officially rebukes him for disturbing the peace, yet hints that she would be delighted if de Soulis were killed. The peace talks come to nothing. Before the talks end, Yves asks about Olivier's whereabouts. De Soulis claims to know nothing. In the winter darkness, as the two sides exit the chapel after Compline, Yves trips over the dead body of de Soulis on the chapel steps. Philip FitzRobert accuses Yves of murder. Defying a promise of safe conduct to all who came with the Empress, twelve men seize Yves near Gloucester, which is duly reported to the Bishop. The Bishop, Cadfael and Hugh examine de Soulis's body and belongings, discovering that de Soulis was stabbed from the front with a dagger. His killer was someone he knew and trusted, and allowed to approach him. In de Soulis's bag, Cadfael finds a seal ring that does not belong to him, which no one in Coventry can identify. Cadfael must decide whether to continue searching for Olivier and Yves and break his monastic vows, or return with Hugh to Shrewsbury. He chooses his son. At Deerhurst Abbey, Cadfael meets a mason's assistant who identifies the seal as belonging to a captain of the garrison, Geoffrey FitzClare, loyal to the Empress. De Soulis showed the men a document with his seal along with that of the other five captains, agreeing to surrender to the King. This was a ruse, as DeSoulis murdered FitzClare, reporting it as an accidental death. Knowing this, Cadfael finds Philip FitzRobert at his castle of La Musarderie in Greenhamsted. He convinces him that Yves is innocent: de Soulis allowed his killer to approach close enough to stab him with a knife, but de Soulis and Yves were open enemies. Repulsed by de Soulis's treachery, Philip releases Yves. Philip holds Olivier in the castle. Cadfael pleads for his release, offering himself in exchange and revealing that he is Olivier's father. Philip refuses. He and Olivier were the closest of comrades, but Olivier refused to follow his friend in defecting to Stephen. Philip changed sides in the hope of breaking the stalemate between the two sides, which Olivier saw as simple treason. Philip visits Olivier in his cell, telling him of Cadfael's offer. Olivier is dumbfounded, not understanding why Cadfael would do this for him. Philip shares that Cadfael is Olivier's father. Olivier is stunned, then enraged, feeling that Cadfael has cheated him. In Gloucester, Yves begs the Empress to lay siege to La Musarderie to rescue Olivier. She agrees only after Yves tells her that Philip is there, her nephew but now her enemy. She alarms her advisers when she announces her intention to hang Philip. This brutality would drive a wedge between her and her brother Robert, absent from Gloucester for this discussion, and increase the fighting in this war-torn country. The Empress orders her entire army to Philip's castle. The night before, Yves enters the castle to warn Philip of her intention via Cadfael, and succeeds in this undercover quest. Philip's garrison puts up a tough defence. Philip suffers serious wounds from a crate of metal pieces thrown by a siege engine into the courtyard. Cadfael ministers to him, while Philip gives his final orders before falling unconscious. His deputy shall surrender the castle and trade Philip to the Empress for the best terms he can get; he gives Cadfael the keys to Olivier's cell. As Cadfael releases Olivier, they face each other as father and son. They arrange a plan to get Philip out of the castle to save him from the Empress. Olivier bears no grudge for his imprisonment, living in the moment as his father does. He uses his uniform to get through the besieging forces, seeking a local man who can claim the unconscious Philip as the corpse of his nephew. The plan works, and Philip recovers in the Augustinian Cirencester Abbey. Brought by Olivier, Robert of Gloucester arrives at the abbey to reconcile with his son. Before leaving La Musarderie, Cadfael learns the killer of de Soulis. Lady Jovetta, lady-in-waiting to the Empress, was Geoffrey FitzClare's mother; she wears as a ring the same design as Geoffrey's seal. Brien de Soulis made what he thought to be an assignation with her niece. He allowed Jovetta to approach him in the mistaken belief that she was the niece. Cadfael keeps her secret. Olivier and Cadfael ride to Gloucester, where they part. Cadfael asks for word when his grandson is born. Cadfael rides alone through rough winter weather to Shrewsbury, feeling fully the importance of his life in the monastery. Arriving at Shrewsbury Abbey after Matins and Lauds, Cadfael lies prostrate on the floor of the chapel as a penitent. Entering before the rest of the monks, Abbot Radulfus informs him that news came before him. The rift between Philip and his father Robert of Gloucester is mended. Philip in his sick bed has taken the Cross. He will join the next Crusade, having despaired of princes in England. Radulfus declares \\"it is enough!\\" and invites Cadfael to take his place among his brothers at Prime.

(Reviewed > December 1, 1994) Emily Melton Continuity This final story is complete on its own, as to plot and setting in history. That is, it is not necessary to read all the prior novels to fully grasp this one. It does include many characters introduced in earlier novels, and includes all the major historical persons in speaking roles at the meeting in Coventry, speaking their own views. Brother Cadfael has the same assistant in the herbarium, Brother Winfrid, for three years (The Hermit of Eyton Forest). Hugh Beringar is still his close friend, and Sheriff of Shropshire, selected by King Stephen, making friends with major barons (Robert of Leicester, character in The Holy Thief) who appear again in this story. Many of the brothers introduced throughout the series appear and react to Cadfael's trip out of their cloister, including Prior Robert, his shadow Jerome, the precentor Anselm, among others. The sister and brother rescued in The Virgin in the Ice, Ermina and Yves Hugonin, have grown in the past six years. Ermina married Olivier Bretagne, a squire in service to their uncle Laurence d‚ÄôAngers. When Yves was old enough to serve as squire, he stayed with his brother-in-law, Olivier for his training, until just before the incident at Faringdon in the summer. Brother Cadfael realised that Olivier was his unknown son from his last time with Mariam in Antioch, years ago when he left the Holy Land after the First Crusade, first seen at the Brompton Priory as he rescued the brother and sister and told his own story. Cadfael thought a real father was no benefit to his son; he had the father described to him by his mother. At their second meeting (The Pilgrim of Hate), Cadfael shares the knowledge with his friend Hugh, who has come to like this knight in service to the other side. Cadfael risked his settled life as a cloistered monk to save his son, a freighted choice, because he was a father before he was a brother, though he did not know it when he committed to the monastery. Abbot Radulfus, head of the Abbey since 1138 (the end of Monk's Hood), met Olivier in The Pilgrim of Hate, learning in this story that Cadfael is his father. Radulfus sees the sin in Cadfael's earlier time with Mariam, which Cadfael sees otherwise. Radulfus holds the power of forgiveness, to decide the time of penance for this transgression of vows, to say \\"it is enough\\". King Stephen and his cousin Empress Maud and their supporters meet under the auspices of three major bishops at Coventry (Roger de Clinton, character in The Heretic's Apprentice, Henry of Winchester brother to the King and character in The Pilgrim of Hate, and Nigel of Ely), in another unsuccessful effort to move toward resolution and acceptance that just one can hold the crown of England at a time. Cadfael, as observer to this chaos among the aristocracy of his adopted home of England, thinks how differently sons are viewed in his birthplace in Wales. In both places, there are children born outside marriage: in England, those sons in particular can be educated, supported, have lands and power, but not succeed as king; in Wales, if acknowledged by the father, they have full rights. Cadfael speculates on the possibly different path for England if the first son of old King Henry, the illegitimate Robert of Gloucester, had been recognised and accepted. This difference between Wales and England in the 12th century figures in many of the twenty novels. The threads of Cadfael's life are brought to a place of satisfaction and of hope, as Ermina is expected to give birth soon ‚Äì a grandchild in addition to his son, and his godson Giles, son of Hugh and Aline Beringar (One Corpse Too Many). Setting in history The novel takes place in November ‚Äì December 1145 as the Anarchy is in a phase of stalemate. Neither side can gain enough ground to stop the other from fighting. On the one hand, Geoffrey of Anjou, husband of the Empress Maud brought his military forces to bear on Normandy being recognised by King Louis VII of France as Duke of Normandy in 1144, where many of Stephen's barons hold land. On the other, King Stephen has recently gained valuable allies in England. After much waffling between the two sides, the powerful Earl of Chester has joined Stephen in a meeting at Stamford. In the Thames Valley, two of the Empress's castellans have defected to Stephen, bringing their castles and garrisons in Faringdon and Cricklade with them, most notably the younger son of Robert of Gloucester, Philip FitzRobert. Philip's story has an interesting parallel with that of William de Dovre. At the meeting called by Bishop Roger de Clinton, most of the people active on each side of this dispute have speaking lines at the table, or later when advising Empress Maud in Gloucester. Many of the characters in the novel are real historical people, as the backdrop for the personal journey of Brother Cadfael. Side view of a mangonel siege engine One type of a crossbow ‚Äì Windlass ‚Äì in use This story includes a medieval siege of a castle, lasting over two days, with the largest military force Empress Maud could muster, initially gathered to discuss the implications of the failed peace talks. Such sieges of castles were the common form of warfare in the Anarchy, \\"war dominated by sieges\\" per Speight . Weapons of the time were few, brutal and less precise compared to those of modern times. Man to man combat included swords and daggers. For both attack and defence, siege warfare employed siege engines to project rocks or incendiaries, while defending archers aimed from the crenels or behind arrowslits. Both attacking and defending archers used longbows, self bows or crossbows. Siege warfare in this era favoured the defenders, unless the besiegers were of huge force or could endure long enough to starve the defenders to submission with no other forces coming to the aid of the defenders. Siege engines were used by the defenders of a well-armed castle, as well. The Fall of Edessa in the Holy Land the previous December in 1144, an event which led to the declaration of the Second Crusade, is much in the air, as bishops across Europe fear for the safety of Jerusalem. Men of England feel this pull to the East, seeking a worthier cause than this tiresome fight in their own nation. The war over the English crown comes to an effective close three years later, in 1148, when Maud retreats to Normandy after Robert of Gloucester's death. The war is not considered officially over, however, until 1154, when King Stephen dies and Maud's son, Henry, ascends the throne according to the treaty made between Stephen and Henry the year before. Stephen's eldest son Eustace died in 1153 a month after the encounter at Wallingford, and his son William was settled in Normandy, not considered for succession after his father. The places of the novel are real, including Coventry, Lichfield, Cricklade, Faringdon Castle, La Musarderie near Greenhamsted (now Miserden), the village of Winstone, Bagendon, Cowley, and the Deerhurst Abbey, the Augustinian Cirencester Abbey, Evesham Abbey, Leominster Priory and the home of Brother Cadfael, the Shrewsbury Abbey.

It has a cyclopentene backbone with two hydroxyl groups adjacent to the double bond and three ketone groups on the remaining carbon atoms. It is sensitive to light, soluble in water and ethanol and forms yellow crystals that decompose at 212 ¬∞C. The compound is acidic and loses the protons from the hydroxyl groups (pKa1 = and pKa2 = at 25 ¬∞C). The resulting anions, hydrogencroconate and croconate are also quite stable. The croconate ion, in particular, is aromatic and symmetric, as the double bond and the negative charges become delocalized over the five CO units (with two electrons, H√ºckel's rule means this is an aromatic configuration). The lithium, sodium and potassium croconates crystallize from water as dihydrates but the orange potassium salt can be dehydrated to form a monohydrate. The croconates of ammonium, rubidium and caesium crystallize in the anhydrous form. Salts of barium, lead, silver, and others are also known. Croconic acid also forms ethers such as dimethyl croconate where the hydrogen atom of the hydroxyl group is substituted with an alkyl group. History Croconic acid and potassium croconate dihydrate were discovered by Leopold Gmelin in 1825, who named the compounds from Greek meaning \\"crocus\\" or \\"egg yolk\\". The structure of ammonium croconate was determined by Baenziger et al. in 1964. The structure of was determined by Dunitz in 2001. Structure In the solid state, croconic acid has a peculiar structure consisting of pleated strips, each \\"page\\" of the strip being a planar ring of 4 molecules of held together by hydrogen bonds. In dioxane it has a large dipole moment of 9‚Äì10 D, while the free molecule is estimated to have a dipole of 7‚Äì7.5 D. The solid is ferroelectric with a Curie point above , indeed the organic crystal with the highest spontaneous polarization (about 20 ŒºC/cm2). This is due to proton transfer between adjacent molecules in each pleated sheet, rather than molecular rotation. In the solid alkali metal salts, the croconate anions and the alkali cations form parallel columns. In the mixed salt , which formally contains both one croconate dianion and one hydrogencroconate monoanion (), the hydrogen is shared equally by two adjacent croconate units. Salts of the croconate anion and its derivatives are of interest in supramolecular chemistry research because of their potential for œÄ-stacking effects, where the delocalized electrons of two stacked croconate anions interact. Infrared and Raman assignments indicate that the equalization of the carbon‚Äìcarbon bond lengths, thus the electronic delocalization, follows with an increase in counter-ion size for salts. This result leads to a further interpretation that the degree of aromaticity is enhanced for salts as a function of the size of the counter-ion. The same study provided quantum mechanical DFT calculations for the optimized structures and vibrational spectra which were in agreement with experimental findings. The values for calculated theoretical indices of aromaticity also increased with counterion size. The croconate anion forms hydrated crystalline coordination compounds with divalent cations of transition metals, with general formula ; where M stands for copper (yielding a brown solid), iron (dark purple), zinc (yellow), nickel (green), manganese (dark green), or cobalt (purple). These complexes all have the same orthorombic crystal structure, consisting of chains of alternating croconate and metal ions. Each croconate is bound to the preceding metal by one oxygen atom, and to the next metal through its two opposite oxygens, leaving two oxygens unbound. Each metal is bound to three croconate oxygens and to one water molecule. Calcium also forms a compound with the same formula (yellow) but the structure appears to be different. The croconate anion also forms compounds with trivalent cations such as aluminium (yellow), chromium (brown), and iron (purple). These compounds also include hydroxyl groups as well as hydration water and have a more complicated crystal structure. No indication was found of sandwich-type bonds between the delocalized electrons and the metal (as are seen in ferrocene, for example), but the anion can form metal complexes with a large variety of bonding patterns, involving from only one to all five of its oxygen atoms.

He was second-in-command to Villa and the head of his personal bodyguard. The Battle of Columbus, New Mexico, in which 18 Americans were killed, sparked the campaign, led by General John J. Pershing, to eradicate Villa's organization. One of Pershing's aides-de-camp was Lt. George S. Patton, who had been searching haciendas of known Villa leaders while on a foraging expedition to obtain corn for horses. C√°rdenas and two other men (a private and a captain in the Villa force) were found during a carefully planned search of the San Miguelito Ranch, after Patton arrived in three cars with ten additional American troopers and two civilian guides. C√°rdenas and his two men fled on horseback, were cut off, and then opened fire on the Americans, resulting in a small firefight between the two groups. In the skirmish, Lt. Patton was popularly said to have personally shot C√°rdenas with his six-gun.Patton Headquarters website timeline Patton then put a notch in his gun and strapped C√°rdenas to the hood of his car (along with two other dead villistas). He later took C√°rdenas's spurs as a souvenir. These spurs are now in the Museum of World War II. However, in the actual fighting, Patton only reported shooting the horse of one of two other men at close range, allowing that man to be killed shortly thereafter. All of the three men who were killed in the fight were shot at by Patton at some point. However, in the end, all the bodies had multiple wounds and with four or five men in the American force firing at the same time, it was impossible to attribute these kills individually to any one trooper. C√°rdenas was killed last, by that time fleeing on foot. According to Patton's account, one of the two civilian guides, an ex-Villista named E.L. Holmdahl (now working for the Americans) actually fired the last shot that killed the wounded C√°rdenas, who at the end of the fight had refused to surrender and continued firing.D'Este, A Genius For War, Chapter 13, pp. 172‚Äì175 References People of the Mexican Revolution Mexican rebels Mexican outlaws Deaths by firearm in Mexico 1916 deaths Year of birth missing ","title":"Julio C√°rdenas"},{"id":"23795104","title":"Trevor Booker"},{"id":"23795112","text":"A wain is a farm wagon.

The island was also known as de Laet's Island, Kalebacker's Island, Boston Island and B&A; Island, the last two names in reference to the Boston and Albany Railroad. The island stretched from Mill Creek north to the Livingston Avenue Bridge. Van Rensselaer Island is now connected to the City of Rensselaer, and is no longer an island. Van Rensselaer Island was also a name given to Westerlo Island in Albany, today the Port of Albany-Rensselaer. History De Laet's Island, on the original Map of Rensselaerswyck, c. 1632; north is to the right Van Rensselaer Island with Albany in the distance, c. 1825 The island went through many name changes in the 400 years since Henry Hudson saw it when he was at the present-day site of Albany. The name Kalebacker's Island may be related to the Dutch term \\"kale backer\\", translated into English it means down-and-outer, or mean fellow; the term Kalebacker was the term used by the Dutch for Native Americans who possessed guns, and were regarded as troublesome and war-like. There was a settlement of Native Americans who moved to the island after the Dutch established Fort Orange across the Hudson from the island, they apparently moved there in order to trade with the Dutch, they had a fort, village, and crop fields. The site is listed in the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation archaeological files, but not within the New York State Museum site files. The name De Laets Eylandt (de Laet's Island in English) was in honor of Joannes de Laet, given in the 1630s by Kiliaen van Rensselaer, the first Patroon of the Rensselaerswyck, a feudal estate encompassing Albany and Rensselaer counties. On May 1, 1658 Jan Baptist van Rensselaer, the director of the patroonship leased to Arent Adriessen all the tilled land on the island, which was referred to as \\"the island opposite the center of the village of Beverwyck\\". The lease was set for four years. Van Rensselaer Island is across the Hudson River from Fort Orange. In this map north is to the right. In the 1800s the island became the site of the Boston and Albany Railroad's (B&A;) passenger depot, shops, freight houses, round house, and coach yard. The island was the site of transfers between trains of the New York Central and the B&A.; The island became known as the Boston and Albany Island, or just Boston Island. A ferry transported people to and from the island and downtown Albany at Maiden Lane. The railroad changed the shoreline of the island by building docks for receiving coal and grain and by dredging an east‚Äìwest channel splitting the island in half. In 1871 the Maiden Lane Bridge was built replacing the ferry. When the NY Central and the B&A; merged in 1900 the island's activities became less important, though a new round house and coach yard was built even as many buildings were demolished. In 1903 the channel that separated the island from the mainland was filled in with sand dredged from the bottom of the Hudson River. Also in 1903 the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad purchased outright the island from the van Rensselaer family for $6,000. The Maiden Lane Bridge and all the railroad associated buildings were demolished when in 1969 the Rensselaer City School District's school campus was built on the portion of the island north of Quackenderry Creek. Two years earlier the Rensselaer side approach and exit ramps for the Dunn Memorial Bridge were built on the southern part of the island, just north of Mill Creek. The site of the Rensselaer City School campus is slated to be redeveloped as a mixed-use waterfront community, the developers (U.W. Marx Construction) gave the school land that had recently been annexed from a neighboring town, now in the northern section of the city, and built a new school campus. The redevelopment of of the island is named de Laet's Landing in honor of Johan de Laet and the original name of the island. De Laet's Landing is a project estimated at costing about $300 million, and could take 10‚Äì15 years to build to completion. The project would include offices, retail, restaurants, apartments, a promenade along the Hudson, and a marina carved from the waterfront; it is modeled on Baltimore's Inner Harbor. The project was dealt a setback in late 2009 when the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation declared that the project's marina would need to be reworked so as not to disturb he water celery along the shoreline, which is important for keeping the water clean and provides habitat for fish, it is rare along that stretch of the Hudson due to dredging of the shipping channel. This set-back, however, has not stopped the project; de Laet's Landing has been approved for a $1.4 million grant by the Empire State Development Corporation and the company planned on breaking ground sometime in the later half of 2010. As of June 2014, no construction project has begun; however, casino development has been proposed for this location.Access date=June 2014 Geology Today the island is no longer an island as the channel to the east has been filled. The area consists of Middle Ordovician bedrock made of Normanskill shale, with soil consisting of loamy and sandy udorthents dredged from the bottom of the Hudson River. During the 17th century the island probably had an elevation of about or less above the river, today it is about 25 feet. Mill Creek enters the Hudson River at the southern end of the island. In the past the Quackenderry Creek emptied into the Hudson at the channel between the island and the mainland, today the creek continues through the area.

Sindhuraj.The film stars Prithviraj Sukumaran, Bala, Priyamani, Meera Nandan and Nedumudi Venu in the lead roles. The film was shot at locations in Kochi, Thrissur, Palakkad, and Malaysia.The film's original background score and soundtrack was composed by Deepak Dev. The film was a major commercial success at the box office and was noted for heightening the stardom of Prithviraj in Malayalam film industry. The film was dubbed in Tamil with the same name, and was remade in Kannada as Ziddi. Plot Krishnakumar (Prithviraj Sukumaran) is a resident of an agraharam in Kalpathy. Along with his studies, he pursues a career as a percussionist and teaches the mridangam to local students. He is in love with a girl who is the daughter of a family friend. Their relationship is not only approved, but also supported by both families. Kichu moves on to the city of Kochi (Ernakulam) to enroll at an engineering college. The villain Sudhi (Bala) is a senior student and the youngest of three brothers - the others being Mahi (Sai Kumar) and Giri (Shammi Thilakan). Sudhi pursues a real estate business and routine crimes associated with it. In all his villainous endeavors on the campus, he is supported by his brothers. The main support for the villain family from \\"the system\\" is a police officer named Shivaraman (Vijayaraghavan). The story takes its form when Anjana (Priyamani), Shivaraman's daughter, joins the engineering college. Sudhi is in love with her and to win her love plays the gentleman, concealing and temporarily stopping all his villainous activities. Kichu, as is expected, wins the heart of the girls in the college from almost day one. Sudhi suspects that Anjana is attracted to Kichu, so he moves fast and sends his brother with an official proposal to Anjana's family. Her parents accept the proposal and force the reluctant daughter to agree to it. However, she stipulates a condition: there will be no marriage immediately. Sudhi has to wait for four years (until the course ends) for the marriage; she will have her freedom for these four years. The \\"freedom\\" of Anjana and the way she exercises it make jealous and suspicious. Sudhi wants to scare Kichu out of the college. He arranges an attack on him at the college hostel; as a result, Kichu is severely wounded. At the end of the attack, when apparently he receives a blow on his head, Kichu appears to turn mad and attacks his own friend who tried to rescue him. He is admitted to a hospital and it is revealed that he has what the doctor in the movie says a \\"flashback phenomenon\\". He had to witness the death of his younger brother, while young, hit by a bus, and traumatic incidents like this will turn him violent. His prearranged marriage has been disapproved by his would-be's family following this. His own family does not want him to go to the college anymore, but his father (Nedumudi Venu) supports him, urges him to go back to the college, and asks him to win his life. What happens after this is an unbelievable change in Kichu's character. A hitherto simpleton now turns a superhero. The villain welcomes him back at the college with an attack. Kichu, the now fearless superhero, gives a difficult-to-believe show of stunts. Sudhi's brothers turn in for help. Kichu sends the eldest brother, Mahi, to the hospital, mortally wounded. He is put in the ICU for observation and is reportedly in a coma. The villain's ally, Shivaraman, arrests Kichu and takes him to the police station. Here, Kichu learns that he is going to be transported to the sub jail where his murder is planned. Kichu turns violent and storms the police station. He is hit by a policeman from behind and apparently falls unconscious, but it is only an act. He is rushed to the hospital, where he makes his escape. The villains kidnap Anjana. In the final stunt at a construction site of a multi- storied building, Kichu beats numerous stuntmen and tells Sudhi the truth about Kichu and how he wants to see Sudhi become a good person towards Kichu. However, Sudhi, who is still angry, denies and tells Kichu that he does not want a life, so Kichu lets go of his hand, and Sudhi dies. Kichu walks away with Anjana as the credits start to roll.

The Monarto South railway station is north of the South Eastern Freeway between the Callington and Murray Bridge exits, but the locality spans south of the freeway to Chaunceys Line Road and Ferries McDonald Conservation Park. In the late 1970s Monarto Junction (or \\"New Murray Town\\") was proposed to be the site of a new satellite city of Adelaide. By the turn of the century the proposal had been completely abandoned. Monarto South took its name from the cadastral Hundred of Monarto (established 1847) centred on the original township of Monarto to the north. The name of the hundred was after \\"Queen Monarto\\", an aboriginal woman (spouse of a tribal leader) who lived in the area at the time of its proclamation. Transport Monarto South is adjacent to the main Adelaide to Wolseley line, with Monarto South station formerly a junction for the Sedan branch line running north on the plain between the Murray River and the Mount Lofty Ranges. In the 2010s, a local government project to upgrade Ferries McDonald Road commenced in Monarto South which included bitumization of the road. Due to the presence of mallee fowl in the vicinity the project had to go through several iterations to ensure that the environmental impact is minimized. Completion of the project would create a heavy transport link from Langhorne Creek to the Barossa Valley.

It is located in Orangeburg, South Carolina. Orangeburg Prep has two campuses: the Lower Campus, housing preschool to 5th grade; and the Upper Campus, housing grades 6 to 12. OPS also operates a year-round day care center on the Lower Campus. Orangeburg Prep was formed through the merger of two segregation academies, Wade Hampton and Willington Academy. History In the early 1960s, school desegregation was implemented in the American South, including in South Carolina. Across the region, many local whites formed segregation academies ‚Äî private, white-only schools designed to allow white children to be educated separate from blacks. Wade Hampton Academy, led by local chemical manufacturer T. Elliott Wannamaker, and Head Upper School Teacher Mrs. Sara T. Shuler was such a segregation academy, founded in the fall of 1964 at the moment public schools in Orangeburg were to desegregate. (Wade Hampton II was the owner of the greatest number of slaves in the South before the Civil War; Wade Hampton III was a postbellum Redeemer.) Wannamaker, two years before the school's founding, had written that \\"separation of the races in education, in recreation, in living quarters, and in churches is in the best interest of both races and is essential to the preservation of racial integrity.\\" A group of Orangeburg parents had concluded that \\"separate private school facilities must be provided...[to] avoid the pernicious 'experiment' being foisted upon the people of this state and nation.\\" Wade Hampton Academy enrolled nearly 300 white students at its launch in August 1964; an attempt to enroll two black children into the school at its launch was rejected. Wade Hampton Academy issued its first graduates a lapel pin featuring the Confederate flag and the word \\"Survivor,\\" a pin modeled on those worn by Confederate veterans after the Civil War. In 1970, Wannamaker also led in the establishment of Orangeburg's second independent school, Willington Academy, less than a mile from the Wade Hampton campus. Wannamaker's son-in-law, Larry Plumb, who had served as assistant headmaster of Wade Hampton, became Willington's headmaster. During this period, Wannamaker also helped to establish the South Carolina Independent Schools Association, initially composed of other segregation academies and headquartered in Orangeburg, South Carolina, and served as the organization's first president. Wannamaker also played a pivotal role in helping to establish other segregation academies throughout the southeastern United States during the 1960s and 1970s. Tom Turnipseed was the first executive director of the South Carolina Independent Schools Association and wrote about the strategy of the period: \\"Since we were following a longstanding Southern tradition of being racists in denial, we simply denied race had anything to do with our motives. Dr. Wannamaker and I often discussed how we should discreetly downplay race when asked by the media about the sudden flurry of private school activities, particularly in counties with large populations of blacks. We bristled with indignation when reporters referred to SCISA as an association of 'segregated academies.'\\" By 1971, when public schools in Orangeburg were fully integrated, Wade Hampton Academy and Willington Academy enrolled about 1,500 white students. A number of locations related to Wade Hampton Academy, including its founding and later locations, are listed in the National Register of Historic Places as sites \\"associated with White Resistance.\\" The two schools continued to grow throughout the 1970s and 1980s and formed an intense rivalry, both academically and athletically. However, changes in the economy and a desire to expand the college-preparatory educational opportunities in the Orangeburg area led the boards of directors of both schools to announce they would merge to form Orangeburg Preparatory Schools, Inc. In a letter to parents and students of both schools, H. Ciremba Amick, chairman of the Wade Hampton Academy board, and Thomas B. Jackson, Jr., chairman of the Willington Academy board, wrote: Wade Hampton Academy Headmaster Larry K. Watt was named headmaster of the new school, with Willington Academy's Head of School Ann O. Glover becoming associate headmaster and director of the lower campus. Students, parents, and teachers formed various transition teams between the time of the merger announcement and the beginning of the next school year, and the students of both Wade Hampton and Willington Academies voted to select the Indian as the new school's mascot and red and gray as the colors ‚Äî one from each school, red from Willington and gray from Wade Hampton. (Wade Hampton Academy's teams had been the Rebels, Willington's the Patriots.) In August 1986, OPS opened with an enrollment of more than 1,700 students, the largest enrollment ever at a South Carolina independent school, then or since. But the school faced difficulties: By 1989, enrollment was down to 950, as more white students returned to the public schools. In a 1989 Boston Globe report, the superintendent of Orangeburg's public schools, James Wilsford, credited Orangeburg Prep for stepping away from its segregationist traditions, saying it was \\"a big move towards accommodating the modern world.\\" The Globe story stated that \\"[o]ne black student, the son of a physician, studied at Orangeburg Prep until his family moved back to Ohio recently.\\" By 2007, the Orangeburg public school system was 90 percent black, while Orangeburg Prep was still 95 percent white. =Heads of School= * Mr. Larry K.

Several of the largest diamonds found in Brazil originated here, though medium or low quality stones are more common. A diamond, known as the Abaet√© brilliant, was discovered in the river in 1791 whilst a group of men were searching for gold. In addition to garnets, gold, iridium, jaspers, osmium, and platinum, the gravel contains 30 other minerals. The palladium-free platinum found in the Abaet√© River is strongly magnetic and rich in iron. Dam South of the confluence of the river, along the S√£o Francisco River, is the Tr√™s Marias Dam, (Tr√™s Marias is a popular legend linked with the river and three sisters) named after Bernard Mascarenhas who had built South America's first major hydroelectric power plant in Brazil, the Marmelos Zero Power Plant in 1889. It is one of the largest earth dams in the world for developed for deriving multipurpose benefits. The project envisaged control of the flow of the river through flood storage, improving its navigability, providing irrigation, generating hydroelectric power to supply for the development of industry and other uses. Begun in 1957, the dam was completed in January 1961 while the first units of the power station was commissioned in 1962; the balance five units of the power station were commissioned by end of 1979. Its construction is considered a world record in this type of construction employing 10,000 people working during the peak of construction activity. The dam is long with a base of and a height of . The hydroelectric power station has an installed capacity of 396 MW (six units of 64.6 MW capacity each). The reservoir or the lake formed by the dam, known as the \\"Sweet Sea of Minas\\", has 21 billion cubic meters of water, a surface area of (8.7 times greater than Guanabara Bay), and provides water to 8 municipalities; one of the many islands formed in the lake is an ecological station; the Esta√ß√£o Ecologica de Pirapitinga.

The Ara√ßua√≠ River flows through the Jequitinhonha Valley in the northeast of Minas Gerais, through the town of Ara√ßua√≠, which the river takes its name from. It is a tributary of the Jequitinhonha River, flowing south from its right bank. The confluence of the river is located at . Tributaries include the Gravat√° River, Set√∫bal River, Capivara River, Fanado River and the Itamarandiba River. River valley According to the Funda√ß√£o Jo√£o Pinheiro (FJP) (Jo√£o Pinheiro Foundation), an agency of the government of the state of Minas Gerais, which has the responsibility to provide technical support services to the State Secretariat for Planning and Management and other state operational systems, the Ara√ßua√≠ River raises in the Senador Modestino Gon√ßalves district and joins the Jequitinhonha River in the Ara√ßuai district near the Ara√ßuai town, after traversing a distance of from its source. The river basin includes the Mata dos Ausentes Ecological Station, a fully protected conservation unit. The Ara√ßua√≠ River valley is famous for the settlements that got established during the gold rush period in the early 18th century, in the region of Minas Novas when Sebasti√£o Leme do Prado located gold veins. The Berilo town, known then as √Ågua Suja, got established at the confluence of the Ara√ßua√≠ River and the √Ågua Suja stream. As gold mines were fully exploited and exhausted in the valleys' by the 1730s, agricultural produce got a boost with cultivation of corn and cotton. Cattle breeding in ranches also evolved as a basic sustenance need of the people. However, in the 19th century Ara√ßua√≠ became one of the important cotton producing regions in northern region of Minas and was one of major supply bases for a number of cotton mills that got established by 1868 with the initiative of the Mascernhas brothers, not only in the Municipal district of Sete Lagoas but also in several other municipal districts close to the cotton producing regions.Bergad, p.76 The Ara√ßua√≠ River valley is part of one of the four districts in the northeast of Minas Gerais (considered as cradle of mineral resources, as it has the largest pegmatite source in Brazil) where major deposits of aquamarine, one of the precious gemstone repository in Brazil, has been found. The area has been identified along the Ara√ßua√≠ River course on the north and its southern tributaries on the south. Consequently, in the southern part of the river valley, the cities of Minas Novas, Turmalina, Capelinha, Malacacheta, Novo Cruzeiro and Lufa have been established. The primary and secondary deposits have been fully exploited in some of the well known mines that surround the small town of Ara√ßua√≠ (in the middle of Minas Gerais province), such as the Coronel Murta (for aquamarine), the Rubelita (for tourmaline), Itinga and Taquaral. However, in spite of so many rich mines, the rural town of Ara√ßua√≠, in the upper Jequitinhonha Valley, has not developed and is considered the poorest part with \\"its social and economic similarities to the semi-arid northeast of Brazil\\". The Ara√ßua√≠ River caused severe floods in 1928, which resulted in damages to most buildings and mansions along its river bank. However, the monuments that have survived the flood devastation are the Nossa Senhora do Ros√°rio Church and the old mansions of Domingos de Abreu Vieira in Ara√ßua√≠ town. ;Geology The geological formation of the Ara√ßua√≠ River valley has been categorized as the Ara√ßua√≠ Belt or the Ara√ßua√≠ Orogen, a confined orogen. Its African counterpart is known as the West Congo Belt, with the southern limit extending to the S√£o Francisco Craton. Its formation is attributed to the Mesozoic age, as an Ara√ßua√≠-West Congo Orogen, a single belt of the Ara√ßua√≠-West Congo Orogen, also known as the Brasiliano-Pan-African orogen. The world's largest pegmatite deposits, with gemstones such as emeralds, topaz, aquamarine and tourmaline are found in these geological formations. The Pegmaties also have lithium-bearing strata in the Aricuai- Itinga region of the Jequithinhona valley in the province; 2500 tonnes of petalite was exported in the past, in addition to domestic consumption of 1600 tonnes. Other by-products produced included lepidolite, amblygonite (used for conversion to lithium chemicals) and spodumene. Water resources A water management system is under implementation, which envisages to provide water supply and sanitation services to the Ara√ßua√≠ and Carbonita cities. Under this plan, funded by the World Bank, with a loan of US$198 million with 20% matching funds shared by the concerned two city municipalities, reservoirs and distribution network have been proposed to benefit a population of 47,000 in the two cities with sanitation facilities. IGAM, the Minas Gerais state water management body facilitated this project on the river, from November 2002. ;Power development In 1990, $50 million was reported to have been spent on two sets of generators for the Santa Rita Dam on the Ara√ßua√≠ River, with the purpose of generating 75 megawatts.Gazeta mercantil, Issues 352-404, Gazeta Mercantil S.A. Editora Jornalistica (1990)  Aqua fauna  One of the rear fish species found in 1874 in the Ara√ßua√≠ River is the Steindachnerina elegans (or curimatus elegans) (Steindachneridion is a genus of South American Pimelodid catfish).
