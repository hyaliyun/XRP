Rottenberg is best known for her surreal video and installation work that often \\"investigates the link between the female body and production mechanisms\\". Her work has been exhibited both nationally and internationally. Biography Mika Rottenberg was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1976. She made aliyah to Israel with her family in 1977. In 1998, she graduated from HaMidrasha School of Art, Beit Berl College, Israel. In 2000, Rottenberg moved to New York to continue her education, receiving a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the School of Visual Arts in 2000 and a Master of Fine Arts from Columbia University in 2004. She was represented by Andrea Rosen Gallery in New York City until the gallery closed its doors in 2017. She was also represented by Galerie Laurent Godin in Paris.Mika Rottenberg at Galerie Laurent Godin, https://www.laurentgodin.com/mika- rottenberg As of 2019, she is exclusively represented by Hauser & Wirth, a \\"gallery powerhouse\\" with nine locations throughout the world. Work Rottenberg's video works feature women with various physical eccentricities, such as being very tall, large-bodied, or muscular. In the videos, these women perform physical acts that serve as an allegory for the human condition in post-modern times. Her videos are inspired by women who advertise their unusual characteristic online to be utilized for hire. \\"She hires women who in some form or another, use their body to profit in some way, and she is interested in how these bodies are marginalized and how \\"women's labor has been marginalized and almost invisible throughout history.\\" \\"Her work explicitly concerns interactions between bodies and machines and 'the idea of ownership generally'.\\" \\"Her works allegorize the increasing capitalization of biological life itself: not what labors produce but what bodies consist of, grow, secrete, and reproduce‚Ä¶.by exploring relations between immaterial goods, bodily by-products, and manufactured products, Rottenberg exposes and playfully transgresses the divisions of race, gender, and geography that underlie the post-Fordist world system\\". She describes her work as \\"social Surrealism\\" and \\"a spiritual kind of Marxism.\\" She strives to \\"... give space and a stage to women who don't always obey gender and conventional beauty expectations.\\" Significant works Mary's Cherries (2004), which shows a woman's red fingernails being grown, clipped, and transformed into maraschino cherries, was influenced by a story about a woman with a rare blood type who quit her job to sell her blood. The women featured in Mary's Cherries are all wrestlers for hire. Cheese (2007) is a multi-channel video installation that depicts women with very long hair milking cows and making cheese using a machine powered by the movement of the women's hair. Rottenberg's work was showcased at the Whitney Biennial 2008.Whitney Biennial 2008 Dough (2005-2006) watches Raqui, a size-acceptance activist and frequent collaborator of Rottenberg's as she cries tears that evaporate into steam, causing dough to rise. The dough is then pulled and pushed through holes into multiple rooms by Tall Kat, a skinny, 6'9\\" woman who can reach from room to room. Through their actions, a unit that measures labor is created. In Tropical Breeze (2004), champion bodybuilder Heather Foster drives a converted truck that functions as a shop, packaging her sweat. In the back of the truck, dancer Felicia Ballos pedals a makeshift device, picking up tissues and using gum to stick them to a clothesline, transferring them to Heather, who uses them to collect her sweat for packaging and later for sale. Squeeze (2010) is a video shot on location at a lettuce farm in Arizona and a rubber plant farm in Kirala, India. Actors engage in a variety of gestures including thrusting a tongue through a stucco wall, a line of women massaging hands that protrude through a wall, and Bunny Glamazon being smashed between two mattresses. In 2011, Rottenberg collaborated with artist Jon Kessler on SEVEN, a performance and installation created for Performa 11 in New York City, performed at Nicole Klagsbrun Gallery. According to the Performa website, SEVEN \\"collapse[d] film time and real time to create an intricate laboratory that channels body fluids and colors into a spectacle on the African savannah. In New York, a \\"Chakra Juicer\\" will capture sweat from seven performers engaging in ritualistic athletic activity.\\"Mika Rottenberg and Jon Kessler, SEVEN, Performa 11, http://11.performa-arts.org/event/rottenberg-kessler-performa-commissionSmith, Roberta. Mika Rottenberg and Jon Kessler, 'Seven,' The New York Times, November 10, 2011. In Ponytails (2014), a pair of kinetic sculptures, one blonde and one dark-haired, extend and flip frantically through two glory- hole-like openings in separate gallery walls. Bowls, Balls, Souls, Holes (2014) is a video where bingo, stretching skin, clothespins, a dripping air conditioner, and melting polar ice caps collide in time and space. \\"You feel that you're on the verge of comprehending a cosmic mystery.\\" In 2015, her work NoNoseKnows was featured in the Venice Biennale as part of an exhibition curated by Okwui Enwezor: \\"All the World's Futures.\\" Ceiling Fan #4 (2016) is viewed through narrow, horizontal openings in a gallery wall. Inside, ceiling fans turn, illuminated by pastel light. Cosmic Generator (2017), is a video installation shot partly in Mexicali, along the U.S. Mexico border. It follows workers in cramped spaces performing absurd tasks such as crushing lightbulbs, accompanied by a soundtrack of electronic buzzes and blips.The viewer is shown a series of tunnels, ostensibly linking a variety of workshops and restaurants shown later in the twenty-six-minute piece. Spaghetti Blockchain (2019) was premiered at the New Museum in New York, in a show called Mika Rottenberg: Easypieces. This piece \\"explores ancient and new ideas about materialism and considers how humans both comprise and manipulate matter.\\" The video consists of female throat singers from Tuva, Tyva Kyzy, ASMR-esque videos of colors and sizzling goo, a potato-farm, and interior shots of a Genevan Hall. Rottenberg places these scenes in \\"a kind of superfluous factory of her devising, whose primary product seems to be imagery that's simultaneously pleasurable and queasily troubling.\\" Infinite Earth Foundation Infinite Earth Foundation is a philanthropic non-profit foundation founded in 2008 by Mika Rottenber and artist Alona Harpaz. Their goal is to produce photographic prints to sell \\"at a cheaper price to people who are not necessarily art collectors\\". For their first project, they helped raise money to improve the working conditions at a hand-looming center in Chamba, a north Indian village. Awards In 2019, Rottenberg won the Kurt Schwitters Prize. Kurt Schwitters was a German painter who passed away in 1948. The prize was founded in 1982 by the Niedersachsische Sparkassenstiftung, a musical club in Hanover, Germany. Past Kurt Schwitters Prize winners include Theaster Gates (2017) and Pierre Huyghe (2015). \\"In a joint statement, the jury members said: \\"The imaginative video works and installations by Mika Rottenberg intertwine documentary with fiction in surreal allegories of today's life. Their ingenious visual narratives illuminate the interconnected relationships between economies, geographic areas, forms of work, and added value. . . . In her interdisciplinary- experimental artistic approach and in the exploration of the interweaving of the machine and the body, the sensitivity of groundbreaking artist Kurt Schwitters resounds. This makes her the ideal candidate for the Kurt Schwitters Prize.\\" In 2018, Rottenberg received the James Dicke Contemporary Artist Prize from the Smithsonian American Art Museum (SAAM). In 2014, Rottenberg received the Ruth Ann and Nathan Perlmutter Arist-in-Residence Award at The Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University. In 2011, Rottenberg took part in Sommerakademie im Zentrum Paul Klee, Bern, curated by Pipilotti Rist at the Planete Doc Film Festival Selection in Warsaw. in 2010, Rottenberg received The Flaherty International Film Seminar Fellowship. In 2010, Rottenberg was part of the New Vision Programme Selection at CPH: DOX Film Festiva in Copenhagen. In 2009, Rottenberg was a 5x5 Castello 09 Prize Finalist at Espai D'art Contemporani de Castello in Spain. In 2006, Rottenberg received the Cartier Award, in conjunction with Frieze Art Fair in New York, NY.

He studied Mathematics and Physics at Universit√© Paris-Sud, Computer Science at the Universit√© Pierre et Marie Curie and received his PhD from the Universit√© Pierre et Marie Curie under the supervision of G√©rard Huet, in 1983 at age 23. Career Fages took a junior researcher position from CNRS at Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure, and became in addition, part-time teacher at Ecole Polytechnique from 1985 to 1998, and part-time consultant at Thomson-CSF (now Thales Group) research center from 1985 to 1996. Since 1999, he is a senior researcher at the Institut national de recherche en informatique et en automatique (INRIA), the French national research institute on computer science and control.\\"EU project takes the pain out of packing\\". CORDIS. He is known in unification theory for having shown the non-existence of minimal sets of unifiers in some equational theories (conjecture of Plotkin, 1972), and the decidability of associative-commutative unification in presence of several function symbols (conjecture of Stickel, 1981). In rule-based modelling, he is known for having created in 1988 a reactive rule-based language at Thomson-CSF (now Thal√®s group), which was later industrialized by ILOG (now IBM-Ilog) and became ILOG-Rules in 1996. Fages theorem states that in a logic program with negations, but without circuits through an odd number of negations, the stable models of the program coincide with the Herbrand models of its Clark's completion. This result has shown useful for implementing stable model semantics with classical propositional satisfiability solvers.Erdem, Esra; Lifschitz, Vladimir; (2001) \\"Fages' Theorem for Programs with Nested Expressions\\".

Short analysis The sonnet is about the poet's feelings: when he wrote the poem he was in exile, so he knew that his remains would have been buried far away from his natal island, Zante, and nobody would have cried on his grave. The poet compares himself to Odysseus and finds a difference: the Greek hero, after the Trojan War and his long travel to home, returned to Ithaca and was buried there. The word , that is \\"reclined, lied\\" (second line), is an anticipation of the theme of death, which the last stanza focuses on. In the sonnet there are both neoclassical and romantic elements: references to the classical tradition (Aphrodite, Homer and Odysseus) are typical of neoclassicism and the focus on the poet, the theme of graves and remains and the homesickness are typical of romanticism.

In 1988, after he completed his studies in Business Economics at the Erasmus University and worked as Product-Marketing Manager for Royal Philips Electronics, he founded, with his wife Aletta Stas-Bax, the watch company Fr√©d√©rique Constant. The manufacture's initial strategy was to focus its energy on classical luxury watches at an affordable price. The Accessible Luxury positioning was the basis of strong growth during the financial crisis when consumers came back more to classical values and accessible prices. Peter Stas played an outspoken role in a conflict with the Swatch Group after it announced a reduction in its provision of watch component parts to third parties. Stas said the proposed cuts would establish an unfair advantage and stifle competition, and not be good for the Swiss watch industry or consumer choice. A legal action to request a freeze before the Federal Administrative Court of Switzerland together with eight independent watch and movement companies to block the 2012 cuts was rejected. After a long standoff, Switzerland‚Äôs Competition Commission (COMCO) finally ruled that it would not allow the Swatch Group to reduce supplies of assortments (i.e. the regulating organ of a mechanical movement: escape wheel, pallet lever, balance wheel and balance spring) that it sells to Swiss watch brands outside the group. In 2002, to diversify the Fr√©d√©rique Constant group, Stas and his wife acquired Alpina Watches, a manufacturer of Swiss sports watches founded in 1883.Watch-Wiki:Alpina Watches In 2009, Stas co-founded Ateliers deMonaco, a high-end watch manufacturer based in Monaco.Journal de Monaco - Bulletin Officiel de la Principaut√© du vendredi 5 d√©cembre 2008 n¬∞ 7889, Arr√™t√© Minist√©riel n¬∞ 2008-788 du 27 novembre 2008 portant autorisation et approbation des statuts de la soci√©t√© anonyme mon√©gasque d√©nomm√©e 'Ateliers deMonaco SAM' In 2013, in collaboration with Aletta Stas, Gisbert L. Brunner and Alexander Linz, Peter Stas wrote the book Live your passion, Building a watch manufacture. In 2015, Stas played a substantial role in the introduction of the \\"Horological Smartwatch\\", a smartwatch design that uses a secondary analog dial rather than a screen for its display ‚Äì giving the timepiece a more classic look than other such devices. The Horological Smartwatch product line included models for both the Fr√©d√©rique Constant and Alpina watch brands, and used \\"MotionX\\" core technology licensed from the California-based company Fullpower Technologies. It was developed in a joint venture known as Manufacture Modules Technologies (MMT). In 2016, Aletta and Peter Stas sold their watch brands to Citizen, creating a high-tech collaboration in development of electronic, mechanical and hybrid calibres combining Frederique Constant‚Äôs high-end Manufacture capability with Citizen‚Äôs long history in revolutionary solar, radio and ultra-thin calibre innovations. In 2018, Peter Stas reveals the world's first mechanical smartwatch, the Frederique Constant Hybrid Manufacture that fuses smartwatch technology with a mechanical movement.

The Frankfurt Region was a government region in the Prussian Province of Brandenburg between 1815 and 1945. Its administrative capital was Frankfurt (Oder). Today its western part is in the State of Brandenburg while the eastern part, following frontier changes agreed by the Soviet Union in 1945, is part of Poland. It was created in 1815, when Prussia reorganised its internal administration. It comprised the mostly rural eastern part of Brandenburg, including the New March and Lower Lusatia. From 1871 Prussia itself was part of the newly founded German Empire. In 1938 the districts of Arnswalde and were disentangled from the Frankfurt Region and merged into the new government region called Frontier of Posen-West Prussia, which was incorporated into the Province of Pomerania. At the same time the districts of Meseritz and Schwerin (Warthe), were transferred out of what had previously been defined as the Province of Posen-West Prussia, now becoming part of the Frankfurt Region. In aggregate these changes reduced the land area of the Frankfurt Region from 20,731 km¬≤ to 18,390 km¬≤. In 1945 the part of the region to the east of the River Oder became part of Poland while the western part fell within the Soviet Zone of occupation in Germany. West of the Oder, the Land of Brandeburg, created in 1946, was not administratively subdivided into \\"government regions\\". Three years later, however, the newly evolving East German state undertook further administrative reforms in 1952 and the western areas of the former Frankfurt Region became part of the new Frankfurt Bezirk (district).  Demographics  According to the Prussian census of 1890, the Frankfurt Region had a population of 1,137,157, of which 1,090,794 (95.92%) spoke German, 36,720 (3.23%) spoke Sorbian, 4,813 (0.42%) spoke Polish, 413 (0.04%) spoke Czech, and 3,993 (0.35%) identified as bilingual (speaking German and another language).

The most common symptom of IDD is intermittent dysphoric mood in between seizures. Interictal dysphoric disorder can often be treated with a combination of antidepressant and anticonvulsant medication. History Emil Kraepelin in 1923 first outlined a set of symptoms common in people with chronic epilepsy, the most prominent of which is intermittent depressive episodes. These mood changes occur without any external triggers, during the interictal phase (between seizures). In 1949, Bleuler note a similar syndrome and in 1955, Gastaut confirmed both these observations. Later, Blumer coined the term interictal dysphoric disorder to describe a similar pleomorphic presentation of symptoms exhibited by his patients. Blumer and Altshuler outlined eight affective-somatoform symptoms that characterize IDD: depressive moods, irritability, anergia, insomnia, pains, phobic fears, and euphoric moods. The diagnosis of IDD should be made when at least three of the eight symptoms are present.

Beginnings Geevarghese was born in the ancient aristocratic family of Parapallil in Puthupally, Kottayam as the third son of Mathew Asan and Annamma. His father died when he was very young and he was taken care of by his elder brother P.M.Mathew. Geevarghese received his theological education at Thrikkothamangalam Mor Sharbil Dayro and Manjanikkara Mor Ignatius Dayro. He was ordained priest by Yulius Elias Qoro on 1 August 1958 and for several years served as the vicar of St. George's Simhasana Church, Perumpally. Bishopric Fr. Geevarghese was elected to the episcopate by the Malankara Jacobite Syrian Christian Association meeting at St. George Church, Karingachira in January 1974. Consecrated metropolitan by Patriarch Ignatius Ya\`qub III on 24 February 1974 for Cochin diocese with additional charge of Kottayam diocese, Gregorios became the Metropolitan of Kottayam after the 1982 Synod at Cochin presided by Patriarch Ignatius Zakka I Iwas. In the early 1970s, when the church in Malankara became divided again over the role of the Patriarchate of Antioch, Gregorios led the faithful who maintained their spiritual association with Antioch. Following the death of Catholicos Baselios Paulose II on 2 September 1996, Geevarghese presided over the Episcopal Synod and the Synod of the Malankara Syrian Orthodox Church until his own death. Death Geevarghese died on 22 February 1999. His remains are interred in the sanctuary of the Perumpally Simhasana Church. Patriarch Ignatius Zakka I Iwas visited this church in April 2000 to offer memorial prayers at his tomb. Perumpally Thirumeni's final resting place Legacy Perumpally Thirumeni wrote many of the prayer songs of the Syrian Orthodox Church. He has the record of ordaining the most priests, more than a hundred. Many church buildings were named in memory of Geevarghese Gregorios. He started the Hail Mary Residential school at Perumpally.

There had been a gradual increase in the number of Filipino women participating in Philippine politics, both at the local and national level. Female involvement in the political environment of the Philippines was highlighted by the election of two women as President of the Philippines, namely Corazon Aquino and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.  Legal basis  Representation and integration of Filipino women in Philippine politics at the local and national levels had been made possible by legislative measures such as the following: the Local Government Code of 1991, the Party List Law, the Labor Code of 1989, the Women in Nation Building Law (Philippine Republic Act No. 7192 of 1991), the Gender and Development Budget (GAD), the 1988 Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law, the Philippine Republic Act No. 7688 of 1994, the 1990 Day Care Law (Republic Act No. 6972), the 1996 Paternity Leave Act, the Anti-Sexual Harassment Law (Republic Act No. 7877 of 1995), the Philippine Republic Act No. 7822 of 1995, the Philippine Republic Act No. 8353 of 1997, the Philippine Plan for Gender Responsive Development (1995-2025), and the Philippine Plan for Women which includes the Framework Plan for Women (FPW). Composition The following percentage figures demonstrate the number of female participants from 1991 to 2001 in Philippine politics and government: =Voters, elected candidates, and appointments= There had been 76.7% of female registered voters in the 2001 elections. In 1999, the percentage of Filipino women in public service are 34.6% at the first level, 71.9% at the second level, 34.8 % at the third level, and 18.2% at the cabinet level (as heads of governmental departments). In 2001, there had been 7.7% of Filipino women in the Philippine Senate, 19.0% in the Philippine Congress, 19.5% serving as governors, 13.0% as vice-governors, 16.5% as board members, 15.6% as mayors, 12.4% as vice-mayors, 17.4% as councilors. In Philippine courts, there were 21.4% Filipino women judges in 2001. The preceding figures translates that 90,714 positions (out of 354,387) had been occupied by Filipino women. Directly quoting Mylene Hega's report titled Participation of Women in Philippine Politics and Society: A Situationer written in March 2003, this means that there had been 16 Filipino female governors (out of 79), eight vice governors (out of 79), 97 board members, 16 city mayors (out of 114), nine city vice mayors (out of 114), 182 city councilors, 225 municipal mayors (out of 1,493), 144 municipal vice mayors and 1,731 councilors, 5,350 Punong Barangays or heads of barangays (out of 41,917), 64,142 Sangguniang Barangay leaders, and 18,794 Sangguniang Kabataan chairpersons. Hega further mentioned that, at those times, there were 49,173 Filipino women who were appointed as secretaries and treasures for the barangay. Out of 49,173, female barangay secretaries were at 23,983; while 25,190 were barangay treasurers. =Decision-makers and diplomats= In terms of decision-making positions and diplomatic posts, there had been 138 female Filipino diplomats, wherein 37 were ambassadors (chiefs of missions), 21 were minister-counsellors, and 80 were foreign service officers. According to a Statement of the Philippine Commission on Women: On International Women's Day on March 11, 2013, Filipino women had been appointed by the Philippine president to \\"top strategic and non-traditional government posts\\" including positions such as Chief Justice, as Secretary of Justice, and as Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process. =Military and policing= In relation to the number of women in the Philippine military and in the Philippine police forces, 7 Filipino women had been among the 147 people who graduated from the Philippine Military Academy in 1995, meaning that 3.1% of the 2,658 police were females. =Labor unions= In 1993, there were 41.4% registered labor union female members in the private industry sector. From 1994 to 1996, there was about 60% registered labor union female members in the public sector. 20.7% of the registered women members in the public sector were holding positions as labor union presidents. Obstacles Among the hindrances in participation of women in Philippine politics identified by Helga in her 2003 report include Philippine society's definition of women's role in the community. This role describes women in the Philippines as persons more appropriate for secondary roles such as being supporters of their politician husbands, become \\"diplomatic entertainers\\" for their husband's constituents, being providers of charity work and social welfare functions, their maternal role as caretakers of the next male generation of male politicians, and the access to resources for those who were elected to decision-making positions.

Their bodies were discovered in a series of large mass graves in the forest near Smolensk in Russia following Operation Barbarossa. The investigation was led by world-class pathologists. The Commission concluded that the Soviet Union had been responsible for the massacre. Consequently, the German government made extensive reference to the massacre in its own propaganda in an attempt to drive a political wedge between the Allies of World War II alliance. The severing of relations between the Polish government-in-exile and the Soviet Union was a direct result of Polish support for the investigation. The Soviets denied their responsibility for the crime immediately, and their Extraordinary State Commission was tasked with falsifying documents and forensic science in order to reverse the blame and charged Germany with the crime.Fischer, Benjamin B., \\"The Katyn Controversy: Stalin's Killing Field\\". \\"Studies in Intelligence\\", Winter 1999‚Äì2000.

She was one of the leading British-trained juvenile fillies of 1979, when she won two of her three races including the Hoover Fillies' Mile. In the following year, she finished third on her debut before defeating twenty-two opponents in the 1000 Guineas. She never won again, although she finished fourth when favourite for The Oaks and was narrowly beaten in the Coronation Stakes. She was later transferred to the United States, where she failed to win in three races before dying in 1981 at the age of four. Background Quick As Lightning was an \\"attractive, well-made\\" bay filly with no white markings, bred in Kentucky by her owner, Ogden Mills Phipps. She was from one of the last crops of foals sired by Ogden Phipps' stallion Buckpasser, an outstanding racehorse who was voted American Horse of the Year in 1966. He became a successful breeding stallion, siring La Prevoyante, Relaxing, Numbered Account, and L'Enjoleur. Quick As Lightning's dam, Clear Ceiling, won five races and was a half-sister to several good winners including Misty Morn, Bold Queen (Black-Eyed Susan Stakes), and What A Pleasure (Hopeful Stakes, twice Leading sire in North America). Phipps sent the filly to race in Europe, where she was trained by John Dunlop at Arundel, West Sussex. Racing career =1979: two-year-old season= Quick As Lightning began her racing career in a twenty-four runner maiden race over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse in July. She accelerated well in the closing stages to win from Live Ammo and Moorestyle. The filly was then moved up in class to contest the Group Three Waterford Candelabra Stakes, which was run that year at Ascot Racecourse. She started favourite but appeared outpaced in the closing stages and finished third to Schweppes Forever and Vielle, beaten a total of five lengths. In September, Quick As Lighting started at odds of 9/1 for the Hoover Fillies' Mile (then a Group Three race) at the same course. Carson held the filly up at the back of the field as Appleby Park set a fast pace. In the straight, she made rapid progress but was still three lengths behind Vielle with a furlong to run. Quick As Lightning caught Vielle in the final strides to win by a neck, with Sharp Castan five lengths back in third place. In their annual Racehorses of 1979, the independent Timeform organisation commented that there were \\"good races to be won\\" with the filly over middle distances but expressed doubts about whether she had the speed to win the 1000 Guineas. =1980: three-year-old season= On her three-year-old debut, Quick As Lightning ran in the Fred Darling Stakes, a trial race for the 1000 Guineas, over seven furlongs at Newbury Racecourse in April and finished third behind Millingdale Lillie and the Cheveley Park Stakes winner Mrs Penny. Two weeks later, Quick As Lightning started at odds of 12/1 in the 168th running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket Racecourse. She was ridden by Brian Rouse, who was a late reserve after four better-known jockeys reportedly turned down the chance to ride the filly. The highly regarded but lightly raced Saison started the 4/1 favourite ahead of the Nell Gwyn Stakes winner, Evita, on 15/2 with Millingdale Lillie, Mrs Penny, and Our Home at 8/1 in a field of twenty-three fillies. Rouse settled Quick As Lightning near the back of the field before moving up to challenge the leaders in the last quarter mile. At least seven horses were still in contention a furlong from the finish, as Our Home took a narrow lead from Mrs Penny. Quick As Lightning produced a sustained run on the outside to take the lead a hundred yards out and won by a neck and half a length from Our Home and Mrs Penny. On 7 June, Quick As Lightning was moved up in distance and started the 3/1 favourite for the 202nd running of the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Downs Racecourse. Rouse again restrained the filly until the last quarter mile before switching to the outside, but the favourite was unable to make significant progress and finished fourth of the eleven runners behind Bireme, Vielle, and The Dancer, beaten a total of eight lengths. Quick As Lightning was brought back in distance and equipped with blinkers for her next race, the Group Two Coronation Stakes over one mile at Royal Ascot. She produced an improved effort, but was beaten a neck by the Irish 1000 Guineas winner Cairn Rouge, with Our Home in third place. Quick As Lightning was then moved up again to one and a half miles for the Irish Oaks at the Curragh Racecourse but appeared unable to stay the distance as she dropped away in the last quarter mile to finish fifth of the nine runners behind Shoot A Line. In the autumn of 1980, Quick As Lightning was sent to race in the United States, where she was trained by Angel Penna, Sr.. On 22 December, she made her North American debut by finishing second in an allowance race over eight and a half furlongs at Calder Race Course in Florida. =1981: four-year-old season= On 1 January 1981, Quick As Lightning finished third in a division of the Grade II La Prevoyante Handicap at Calder. On 27 January, she ended her racing career by finishing fourth in an allowance race at Gulfstream Park. Retired to become a broodmare, Quick As Lighting died in April 1981 of haemorrhage shortly before breeding. Assessment In 1979, Quick As Lightning was given a rating of 115 by Timeform, five pounds behind their top-rated two-year-old filly, Aryenne. In the following year, Timeform rated her on 123, eight pounds below the highest-rated three-year-old filly, Detroit. In the official International Classification, she was also eight pounds below Detroit and was rated the sixth-best three-year-old filly trained in Britain behind Mrs Penny, Shoot A Line, Bireme, Vielle, and The Dancer. In their book A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Quick As Lightning an \\"average\\" winner of the 1000 Guineas.

The silent film depicts a group of burglars who plan and execute a successful bank heist. Company employee Jack Frawley was the film's director, also coming up with the story and serving as cinematographer; the cast's identities are unknown. The silent film was the first Lubin Manufacturing Company release to feature an original narrative. The film was created after the commercial success of the Edwin S. Porter film The Great Train Robbery, and was intended to be similar to it. Released on July 30, 1904, reception was mixed. It is credited with having motivated Porter to direct the film Capture of the \\"Yegg\\" Bank Burglars. A print of the seven-minute film, which is now in the public domain, is preserved in the Library of Congress. In 2002, the film was released on DVD as part of a compilation of silent films. Plot After learning they are short of money, a group of four robbers decide to execute a bank heist. The four create a plan and hire an unwitting chauffeur to drive them to their location. As soon as they reach an isolated road, the robbers force the chauffeur out of the car, gag him, and throw him into a ditch. The robbers then drive the car to the bank. After entering, they kill a security guard and use explosives to force the bank vault open. The thieves steal as much money as possible and make a quick retreat to their car. Back in the park, a young couple on a walk discover the unconscious body of the chauffeur, and the man calls the police. The band of robbers, now at home, are about to start splitting their stolen goods equally, when the police barge in. While three of the robbers are subdued after a fight, one manages to make his escape via a window and ends up on the roof. The two policeman chase the criminal, who eludes them by jumping from rooftop to rooftop. After the robber jumps down to the street, he runs toward the railroad station and boards a departing train. The police officers arrive but are too late, as the robber has left. The officers tell the train dispatcher to send a telegram to the next station, informing them of the fugitive and asking them to catch him as soon as possible. When the train reaches the next station, the burglar exits the train and unknowingly runs right into the path of policemen. With all four of the robbers caught, they are sentenced to forty years in jail. While doing work in the jail's quarry, the group review their failure, with each robber pinning the blame on another. Production Siegmund Lubin in 1913. His film studio, the Lubin Manufacturing Company, produced and distributed The Bold Bank Robbery. The Bold Bank Robbery was directed by Jack Frawley and produced by the Lubin Manufacturing Company. Frawley worked at the company, serving as their general manager. He often devised the stories for their films; The Bold Bank Robbery was no exception. The film was the company's first to feature an original narrative. Frawley, who also served as cinematographer for the film, had a relaxed approach to making films; he did not use screenplays and never numbered the scenes. During the assembling of Frawley's films, the sole material for editors to rely on was a pad with notes scrawled in it. The identities of the cast of The Bold Bank Robbery are unrecorded. The film, silent and shot in black-and-white, was filmed in Philadelphia. It was shot using a camera that company creator Siegmund Lubin had built back in 1901. The Bold Bank Robbery was inspired by and created after the success of the 1903 western film The Great Train Robbery; other inspirations included American and European crime films. Lubin Manufacturing Company had been known to produce films similar to other popular ones; film historian Kemp R. Niver observed that \\"if it seemed like a good idea, and other film producers were making money, 'Pop' Lubin simply appropriated the title and remade or duped the motion picture.\\" Siegmund Lubin filed a copyright for the film on July 25, 1904. The finished product comprised 600 feet (182 m) of film. Release The Bold Bank Robbery was released on July 30, 1904. Distribution was handled by Lubin Manufacturing Company and the Kleine Optical Company. To promote the film, Siegmund Lubin placed an advertisement in Billboard; appearing in its October 15, 1904 issue, it was the first film to be advertised in the magazine. The advertisement offered the film for purchase at the price of 66 dollars, along with a free Victor Talking Machine if one were to purchase two other films. An advertisement for the film in the New York Clipper declared that The Bold Bank Robbery was \\"the most sensational film ever made.\\" The film's advertisement in Billboard, which marked the first time a film had been promoted in the magazine. When the film was shown in theaters, it was played alongside a phonograph, a device used to record and replay audio. However, the audio was often not synchronized with the action, perhaps owing to the fact that the projectionists still had to operate the machines by hand. It received a positive review from a writer for the American newspaper The Victoria Advocate, who branded it as a film that \\"everyone should see.\\" Adversely, author Jay Leyda, writing for Film Quarterly, criticized the film for being \\"obviously derivative.\\" In 1904, Edwin S. Porter directed a film entitled Capture of the \\"Yegg\\" Bank Burglars, distributed by Edison Studios. Filmed in August and September of that year, the film features a group of robbers who execute a heist. Porter had been motivated to produce it by The Bold Bank Robbery. A man from Belleville, Ontario, who held screenings of The Bold Bank Robbery and paired it with other films in the crime genre, once screened the films at a fair. The man was surprised by the ovation received from the audience, writing that \\"The applause was something amazing. I really thought the grandstand had collapsed.\\" The film has survived; a print of The Bold Bank Robbery is preserved in the Library of Congress film archive. In 2002, the film was released on DVD by Kino International as part of The Movies Begin, a DVD boxset which collects 133 silent short films released between 1894 and 1913. The film is now in the public domain.

Engines with Renumbering Lists, issued by the Chief Mechanical Engineer's Office, Pretoria, January 1912, p. 47 (Reprinted in April 1987 by SATS Museum, R.3125-6/9/11-1000) Natal's narrow gauge By 1906, the Natal Government had realised that light railways were essential as feeders to open up fertile districts which were distant from the existing main- and branch lines, particularly when the intervening stretches of country were difficult from an engineering point of view. The construction of the first narrow-gauge railway line in Natal was therefore approved. The line was long and stretched from Estcourt to the irrigation settlement of Weenen, an alluvial flat of about adjoining the Bushman's River. The maximum gradient on this line was 1 in 33 (3‚Öì%) compensated, with a minimum curvature of radius. It was laid with rail. Manufacturer The Class N 4-6-2T tank locomotive was designed by D.A. Hendrie, Locomotive Superintendent of the Natal Government Railways (NGR) from 1902 to 1910. It was the first narrow-gauge locomotive of the NGR. An order for the construction of two of these locomotives was placed with Hunslet Engine Company in 1906. They were delivered in April 1906, numbered 1 and 2, and were placed in construction service on the new narrow-gauge line to Weenen. Characteristics D.A. Hendrie Commonly known as the Hunslet Side Tanks, the locomotives had outside plate frames and used Walschaerts valve gear. The firebox was long and, to obtain the required grate area, the width was extended to at the foundation ring. To obtain a liberal firebox depth, the frames were opened out for some length at the rear end, with each frame constructed in two pieces which were connected by a cross stretcher in front of the firebox throat plate. The cylinders were arranged horizontally outside the plate frames, while the flat \\"D\\" type slide valves were arranged above the cylinders and actuated by Walschaerts valve gear. Service =Natal Government Railways= The Weenen narrow-gauge line was opened to regular passenger and goods traffic on 18 April 1907. As a result of tick fever restrictions upon the movement of ox wagon transport, a limited goods traffic service was already inaugurated on 4 October 1906 while the line was still under construction. This limited service was by construction train from Estcourt to Halfway House, a distance of . By the end of 1906, the limited service had been extended all the way to Weenen.Year in service 1906 The two engines performed well and were capable of hauling loads of up the maximum gradients with comparative ease at about . On easier sections they were able to attain a maximum speed of . When a locomotive classification system was introduced on the NGR by 1908, all narrow-gauge locomotives were designated Class N.The Railway Report for year ending 31 Dec. 1908, Natal Government Railways, p. 39, par 14. =South African Railways= When the Union of South Africa was established on 31 May 1910, the three Colonial government railways (Cape Government Railways, NGR and Central South African Railways) were united under a single administration to control and administer the railways, ports and harbours of the Union. Although the South African Railways and Harbours came into existence in 1910, the actual classification and renumbering of all the rolling stock of the three constituent railways were only implemented with effect from 1 January 1912.The South African Railways - Historical Survey. Editor George Hart, Publisher Bill Hart, Sponsored by Dorbyl Ltd., Published c. 1978, p. 25. The two locomotives were not renumbered by the South African Railways (SAR) in 1912, but had the letters NG, for narrow gauge, prefixed to their existing numbers. They remained unclassified on the SAR, since a classification system for narrow-gauge locomotives was only adopted in the late 1920s after they had been withdrawn from service. =Mo√ß√¢medes Railway= In 1915, both locomotives were sold to the Mo√ß√¢medes Railway in Portuguese West Africa.

It was successful in this effort and established a profitable near-monopoly which it maintained by buying out or bankrupting new competitors. In response to the Fraser Canyon gold rush and economic growth in the Pacific Northwest, the company expanded to ocean routes from San Francisco north to British Columbia. Similarly, as California's economy grew, the company offered service from San Francisco south to San Pedro and San Diego. It exited these markets in 1867 when competition drove prices to unprofitable levels. While the California Steam Navigation Company was successful throughout its life in suppressing steamboat competition on its core Bay Area and river routes, it could not control the rise of railroads. These new competitors reduced the company's revenue and profit. Finally, in 1871, the company's assets were purchased by the California Pacific Railroad, and the corporation was dissolved.  Early history  1863 advertisementIn the 1840s and 1850s road and rail networks in the Bay Area and inland California were primitive. Steamboats and the barges they towed played an important part in moving people, agricultural commodities, and other goods around the region. Numerous wharves and depots sprang up in San Francisco Bay, San Pablo Bay, and Suisan Bay. Steamers also ascended the rivers that emptied into these bays, notably the Sacramento River and San Joaquin River. The Sacramento River was navigable for 250 miles and in periods of high water even further upstream. The Feather River, a tributary of the Sacramento, was navigable beyond Marysville during portions of the year. The San Joaquin was navigable year-round as far as Stockton and in periods of high water, steamers could reach into Fresno County, about 200 miles from the river's mouth. In 1848 there were but two steamers on the Sacramento River. You could travel from San Francisco to Sacramento for $30 with a cabin, or for $20 on deck. As the California gold rush began, the number of ships sailing on the Sacramento River shot to sixteen in just eighteen months, all of them built in eastern shipyards and sailed around Cape Horn. By 1851 fares had dropped to $1 as all the new ships fought for customers. To make matters worse for the shipping companies, they ordered additional steamers during the boom times and they began to arrive. With loans to pay, the ship owners had no choice but to put them into service, despite the already ruinous level of competition. By 1853 there were 25 steamers running the Sacramento River alone. The steamboat owners ended their unprofitable competition by combining almost all the vessels that served the inland trade. On February 22, 1854 the California Steam Navigation Company was incorporated under the laws of California. The company's initial shareholders included Richard Chenery, Captain James Whitney, jr., Marshall Hubbard, John Bensley, and Major Samuel J. Hensley. All five men served as president of the company at various times.  Inland competition  The new California Steam Navigation Company moved quickly to retire excess capacity: 23 ships were idled. The combination effectively eliminated competition on the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. This allowed the company to raise rates and profitability returned for the company's owners. This profitability lured new competitors, just as it did in 1850. Individual boats such as Surprise and Martin White began service in 1855. Rates from San Francisco to Sacramento fell as low as $0.25 per passenger as the California Steam Navigation Company sought to eliminate the thinly- capitalized newcomers. In their outrage at freight rates that were raised to $40/ton after the consolidation, Marysville merchants formed the Citizens' Steam Navigation Company to compete with the company in 1854. It's competitive steamer, Enterprise, carried the freight for $12/ton. Not content to have any competition, the California Steam Navigation Company lowered its rate to $1/ton. Citizens' Steam Navigation Company built a larger ship, Queen City, but at the low prices they had to charge to compete, it lost money on every load. Citizen's Steam Navigation could not find sufficient financing to continue operations under these circumstances. On October 1, 1855 it signed a contract giving the California Steam Navigation Company control over its ships, effectively reinstating the company's monopoly on transportation to Marysville. The general public and the local business community loathed the California Steam Navigation Company for its monopoly rates and the harsh tactics it used to suppress competition. One newspaper went so far as to editorialize that all candidates for the state legislature should pledge, \\"eternal opposition to the California Steam Navigation Company\\"  Ocean and coastal service  The Fraser Canyon gold rush created an immediate and large demand for transportation from the Bay Area to British Columbia beginning in 1857. The \\"forty-niners\\" who rushed to the California goldfields now rushed to mine the new Canadian workings. Similarly, California's growing economy created new demand for transportation to the south as well. The California Steam Navigation Company used a few of its largest steamers for these new routes and acquired other ocean-going ships to meet this demand. Pacific was purchased in 1859. Brother Jonathan was purchased and refit in 1861. Ajax and Orizaba were purchased in 1865. California was built for the company in 1866. In 1856 Senator began \\"South Coast\\" service between San Francisco and San Diego with stops in San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and San Pedro. Orizaba began sailing to the \\"South Coast\\" in 1865. In 1859 Pacific began service to Victoria with stops in Crescent City and Portland and was later joined by Brother Jonathan, and Active. California sailed this route as well, beginning in 1866. In January 1866 the California Steam Navigation established another ocean route, offering the first regular steamship service between San Francisco and the Hawaiian Islands using its steamer Ajax. After only two round trips, however, the company put her on the San Francisco - Portland route to counter new competitive pressure. These new ocean routes brought the company into contact with new competitors. In the north, the Pacific Mail Steamship Company sold its business to the California, Oregon, and Mexico Steamship Company in 1861. Ben Holladay, a tough steamboat pioneer, ran this dominant company. At the time of the acquisition It had five steamboats on the San Francisco - Victoria route to the two (Pacific and Brother Jonathan) deployed by the California Steam Navigation Company. Holladay added more ships, but the two companies appeared to have an understanding that prevented a rate war. This changed in 1865 when Jarvis Patton established the Anchor Line, and put his ship Montana on the San Francisco - Victoria line. He cut prices to gain customers, but with only one ship on the route, the pricing equilibrium between the two main competitors more or less remained. In 1866, however, Patton built Idaho, and a full-scale rate war broke out. Profitability went out of the northern route.  Decline  In 1867, the fare war on the northern route forced consolidation. The California, Oregon, and Mexico Steamship Company bought the entire ocean-going fleet of the California Steam Navigation Company. It bought Active, Ajax, California, Orizba, Pacific, and Senator. This forced the California Steam Navigation Company back to its Bay Area core, which itself was suffering from competition from new railroads. On March 31, 1871, the California Pacific Railroad Company acquired all property of the California Steam Navigation Company. This included thirty-two sidewheel and sternwheel steamships, twenty-one barges, twenty wharves and depots, and the franchises that allowed the ships to sail. Cash from the asset sale was distributed to shareholders and the company was disincorporated in September 1871. The railroad continued the operation of the steamboats, integrating them with its own routes and pricing scheme.Lance Armstrong, Capital City, Fort Sutter were among river‚Äôs most famous steamboats, Valley Community Newspapers, 10 June 2013, from valcomnews.com accessed November 23, 2013 Excerpt from a series about the history of the Sacramento River. The steamboat-railroad merger was driven by the same desire to reduce competition that had driven the previous steamboat company mergers. Five months later, the Central Pacific Railroad acquired the California Pacific Railroad Company, creating an even more powerful transportation monopoly.Maritimeheritage.org: The Maritime Heritage Project, Shipping Lines in San Francisco Bay Area during the 1800s ‚Äî California Steam Navigation Company In a confusing epilog to the corporation's history, a new and unrelated steamboat company was created after the disincorporation which was also called the California Steam Navigation Company. It too, ran steamboats on the Sacramento River, but in this new world it was the upstart competitor under-cutting the monopoly rates of the entrenched incumbent. This second California Steam Navigation Company passed out of existence in June 1889 when it merged with the San Joaquin Improvement Company to become the California Steam and Improvement Company.  Fleet  The California Steam Navigation Company owned and chartered dozens of ships, barges, tugs, and boats. Relatively few were in full-time service on specific routes. Some were operated only seasonally to meet the peak demand of the summer harvest time, when ships and barges would bring crops from the interior to San Francisco. Some were operated only when high water allowed passage to ports further inland on the rivers. Some ships were held in reserve, to replace vessels that were due for maintenance or were damaged. Some ships were used as storeships, floating warehouses and offices. Some vessels were anchored or moored and never used. These were typically ships bought from competitors to keep them from competing, or obsolete ships that the company would not sell for fear of them falling into the hands of potential competitors. The company established a base for its unemployed ships in Oakland. Below is a partial list of the company's ships and barges with a focus on how they came to be part of and then left the fleet. = Ships = Active (sidewheel steamer): She was built for the Sacramento River route in 1849. She was purchased by the US Coast Survey in 1852. The government sold the ship for $30,000 in June 1862. After a variety of private charters, the company acquired her no later than April 1866. The ship was, in turn, acquired from the company by the California, Oregon, and Mexico Steamship Company in 1867. She hit a rock and was wrecked south of Cape Mendocino in 1870. Ajax (propeller steamer): Built in Brooklyn, New York in 1864, she was purchased by the company with California in 1865 for $250,000. The ship was acquired from the company by the California, Oregon, and Mexico Steamship Company in 1867. Amador (sidewheel steamer): She was built for the company and entered service in October 1869. She was acquired from the company by the California Pacific Railroad Company in 1871. Amelia (sidewheel steamer): She was launched in 1863 originally as a San Francisco Bay ferry, running between Alviso and San Francisco. In 1868, Amelia was one of the first steamers in the Bay Area to convert from coal to oil for fuel. She was acquired from the company by the California Pacific Railroad Company in 1871. American Eagle: She was one of the original ships consolidated into the company in 1854, The ship was damaged in a boiler explosion and thereafter lay moored on the levee in Sacramento for several years. In 1859 her topsides were removed and she was converted into a barge. Anna Abernethy (sidewheel steamer): She ran as a competitor to the company on the Marysville - San Francisco route beginning in 1854. She was taken over by the company by 1856. She broke her drive shaft while on the Petaluma - San Francisco run in 1857. Antelope (sidewheel steamer): The ship reached the Bay Area in 1851 by sailing around Cape Horn. In California she sailed for the \\"Independent Line\\" and was one of the vessels consolidated into the California Steam Navigation Company when it was formed in 1854. The vessel was acquired from the company by the California Pacific Railroad Company in 1871. Banner (sternwheel steamer): She was a light draft vessel which began competing with the company on the upper reaches of the Sacramento River in May 1862. By December 1863 she had been acquired by the company. The ship was burned and nearly destroyed by an arsonist in December 1864. She was repaired and returned to the river in May 1866 to compete with the company again. She was back in the company's fleet no later than 1868. She was acquired by the California Pacific Railroad Company in 1871. By 1872 her machinery was removed and she was slated to be broken up. Belle: She was one of the original vessels consolidated into the company in 1854. On February 5, 1856 her boilers exploded killing about two dozen people. The ship appears to have been repaired, but renamed Swan (see below), so as to disassociate her with the disaster. Brother Jonathan (sidewheel steamer): She was purchased by the company and refit in 1861. She sank with the loss of perhaps 225 lives in 1865. C. M.

Bragdon in January 1853. Ten lives were lost. She was repaired and returned to service, becoming one of the ships that was consolidated into the company in 1854. It is likely that she was converted into a barge of the same name by 1858. Clara: She was one of the original ships consolidated into the company and was used briefly as a ferry to Alameda. The ship was sold in July 1854 for $9,000 and disappears from Bay Area press accounts. Cleopatra: She was one of the original vessels consolidated into the company in 1854. Her machinery was removed and she was broken up in 1862, with her pilot house transferred to Goodman Castle.

Express: She was one of the original vessels consolidated into the company in 1854. The ship was owned by the company at least until 1856. In June 1870, the ship was owned by an independent operator that competed with the company on the San Francisco - Oakland route. This venture failed, and the ship was sold at auction for $1,200 on January 12, 1872 Flora (sternwheel steamer): The ship was built for the company's trade with Marysville, and thus had an exceptionally shallow draft of 11 inches.

Surprise: She was built in San Francisco and had her sea trial on April 2, 1855. She ran in competition to the company, but by November 1855 she had been sold to the company. Unlike many of the California Steam Navigation Company's surplus vessels, Surprise was sold, but in a way that guaranteed she would never come back to compete with the company's ships. Her new owners took her to China, via Honolulu, in May 1861 to carry freight on the Yangtze River. She sailed into the middle of the Taiping rebellion, was fired upon by shore batteries, and eventually burned at Shanghai. Swallow (sternwheel steamer): She was built in San Francisco for the company and launched in November 1860. The ship's machinery was reused from Willamette.

Willamette: Beginning in late 1854, she competed for a time with the company's ships on the Sacramento River. The company lowered prices making Willamette unprofitable. Her owners were forced to sell the ship to the California Steam Navigation Company, which chose to simply moor the ship and let it rot. She was eventually broken up and her machinery used in Swallow. Wilson G. Hunt (sidewheel steamer): She was acquired in New York by John Bensley and sent to San Francisco in 1849. She was one of the original vessels consolidated into the company in 1854.

Common names include long-spined sea urchin, black longspine urchin and the banded diadem. It is native to the east coast of Africa, the Red Sea, the Indian Ocean and western Pacific Ocean. It was first described in 1829 by the French naturalist Jean Victoire Audouin. The specific epithet honours the French zoologist Marie Jules C√©sar Savigny who described many new marine species from the Mediterranean Sea and Red Sea. The type locality is Mauritius. Description Diadema savignyi Diadema savignyi has a usually black, spherical, slightly-flattened test up to about in diameter. The brittle, thin, hollow spines grow in tufts and can be as long as . They are usually black but can also be grey, dark brown or purple. They may be banded with lighter and darker shades in juveniles and the occasional individual sea urchin is completely white. Diadema savignyi is similar in appearance to the closely related Diadema setosum with which it is sympatric, that is, the two species share a common range and frequently come into contact with each other. Diadema savignyi can be distinguished by the fact that it has iridescent green or blue lines in the interambulacral areas and around the periproct, a cone- shaped region surrounding the anus. In a small number of individuals there are pale coloured spots at the aboral (upper) ends of the interambulacrals. Another distinguishing feature is that D. savignyi does not have a thin orange ring round the periproct whereas D. setosum does. Distribution and habitat The range of Diadema savignyi extends from the eastern coast of Africa and the Red Sea to French Polynesia, Hawaii, New Caledonia and northern Australia. It is typically found on mixed sandy, rocky and coral substrates especially in areas disturbed by storms or by other natural causes. Its depth range is from the surface down to about . Biology Diadema savignyi is nocturnal and tends to hide in crevices or under boulders during the day, or several individuals may huddle together in the open. The urchins disperse at dusk to feed on the algal mat that grows over the surface of seabed. In the course of tearing up the mat the urchin also abrades the underlying surface, causing bioerosion. Its activities help control the algae which otherwise might overwhelm the corals. Certain small fish such as cardinal fish, flatworms and shrimps sometimes seek protection from predators among the long spines. The sea urchin is preyed on by pufferfish (Tetraodontidae) and porcupinefish (Diodontidae), and also lobsters and snails. It reacts to a shadow falling on it by angling its spines towards the possible attacker. Diadema savignyi and Diadema setosum live in close proximity and often in mixed groups on reefs and in shallow lagoons off the coast of East Africa. The latter breeds throughout the year, but breeding in D. savignyi is concentrated and occurs mainly during the north-east monsoon period, peaking in May. Hybridisation between the two species is largely prevented by the fact that the release of gametes by each is synchronised with the lunar cycle. D. savignyi spawns just after the full moon, on days seventeen to eighteen of the lunar cycle, whereas D. setosum mostly spawns around days eight to ten.

History  Only a few examples of staircase towers have survived from ancient times (e.g. on the Imperial Baths in Trier); staircases were often superfluous on the only single-storey buildings or were built into the outer walls of buildings that were often several feet thick. This tradition continued in the keeps (donjons), churches and castles of the early and high Middle Ages; and this situation only changed with the increasing construction of purpose-built and generally rather undecorated staircase towers of the High and Late Middle Ages (Romanesque and Gothic architecture styles). Since the Renaissance period, staircase towers were markedly more decorative and representative of status. Stairs were now rarely hidden or built externally, but there were both artistically designed, curved and straight-running staircases inside the building with ornate ceilings and railings (e. g. Ch√¢teau de Chambord, Palazzo Barberini and Ch√¢teau d'Azay-le-Rideau or Ch√¢teau de Chenonceau). With the increasing construction of straight staircases with intermediate landings (the modern stairwells) separate staircase towers became gradually rarer.

He is the son of Ismael \\"El Mayo\\" Zambada, one of the top leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel. He is married to Karime Ellameli Torres Acosta, the daughter of the late Manuel Torres F√©lix, another Sinaloa Cartel leader. Zambada Ortiz was active on social media, where he posted pictures of his extravagant lifestyle. On 20 November 2013, he was arrested by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) at the border crossing in Nogales, Arizona. The U.S. government charged him with importing large sums of cocaine and marijuana to the U.S. from Mexico. He was sentenced to five and a half years in prison, an unusually low sentence for high-profile drug cases. On 11 September 2018, he was released from prison. Early life and career Zambada Ortiz was born in San Diego, California, United States on 27 May 1990 to Leticia Ortiz (mother) and Ismael \\"El Mayo\\" Zambada (father), one of the top leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel, a Mexican drug trafficking organization. He grew up in Sinaloa and spent some years in Phoenix, Arizona. Zambada Ortiz was an agronomy student at the Autonomous University of Sinaloa in Culiac√°n, Sinaloa. He married Karime Ellameli Torres Acosta, daughter of Manuel Torres F√©lix (\\"The Crazy One\\"), another former Sinaloa Cartel drug lord, on 6 February 2006. Torres F√©lix, brother of Javier Torres F√©lix (now imprisoned), was killed in a gunfight with the Mexican Army on October 2013. Zambada Ortiz had a close relationship with Ismael Zambada Imperial (alias \\"El Mayito Gordo\\"), one of his other brothers from another of his father's mistresses. On Twitter and Facebook, Zambada Ortiz uploaded pictures of his extravagant lifestyle filled with luxurious watches, trucks, golden-encrusted weapons, and exotic animals. The photographs Zambada Ortiz uploaded on social media helped the U.S. authorities identify and implicate him with other Sinaloa Cartel associates. In particular, Zambada Ortiz had several pictures with numerous members of Los √Åntrax, an armed squadron of the Sinaloa Cartel. He also has a narcocorrido song from Enigma Norte√±o, a musical group from Sinaloa, about him. In the drug ballad, Zambada Ortiz is described as a humble man who enjoys sports, weapons, and drinking. The song concludes with a greeting to Jes√∫s Alfredo and Iv√°n Archivaldo Guzm√°n Salazar, sons of Joaqu√≠n \\"El Chapo\\" Guzm√°n. =Criminal charges= In September 2013, Zambada Ortiz was charged with conspiracy to traffic cocaine and methamphetamine from Mexico to the United States through a California grand jury indictment. The court alleged that he imported at least 500 grams of methamphetamine and 5 kilograms of cocaine, but no further details were provided. If sentenced for such charges, he will face one to ten years in prison in the United States and forfeit all the drug proceeds he earned from his criminal activities. Zambada Ortiz was also identified by U.S. authorities by his alias \\"Sera\\". However, he is not wanted for any criminal charges by Mexican law enforcement. His brother Vicente Zambada Niebla, arrested in Mexico City in 2009, was extradited to the United States and is awaiting trial in the state of Illinois. His uncle Jes√∫s Zambada Garc√≠a (alias \\"El Rey\\") was arrested by Mexican authorities in 2008 and extradited to the U.S. on 2012. Zambada Ortiz's father \\"El Mayo\\" Zambada was the right-hand man of Joaqu√≠n \\"El Chapo\\" Guzm√°n, the former top leader of the Sinaloa Cartel. Arrest and case While crossing the international border through Nogales, Arizona from Mexico to do some Christmas shopping, Zambada Ortiz and his wife were arrested by federal agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) on 20 November 2013. His wife was released shortly thereafter but he was sent to a prison in Tucson, Arizona. The September charges against Zambada Ortiz had been kept confidential, catching him by surprise while he attempted to cross into the United States legally. On 25 November, the case was moved from Tucson to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California in San Diego, California. Two days later, he appeared in court in San Diego and pleaded not guilty to the drug trafficking charges. The magistrate ordered Zambada Ortiz to be held without bail and told his attorneys that they could ask for a bail in the next hearing, initially scheduled for 3 January 2014. Outside the courtroom, his attorney stated that the Facebook and Twitter accounts that were used to identify his connection with the Sinaloa Cartel were not his. On 1 January 2014, Zambada Ortiz turned down his right to a speedy trial after deciding that his legal team wanted to continue gathering evidence. His lawyers argued that there was more evidence surrounding the case that needed to be investigated and analyzed by the team. Imprisoned in a maximum security cell, Zambada Ortiz asked to delay his trial to mid-March 2014. However, the San Diego federal court judge refused to postpone the trial and ordered the hearing for 17 January and the case for 3 February 2014. The hearing was postponed for 5 February 2014 because new evidence was presented by the DEA a day before the hearing. The day before, however, the hearing was postponed once again for 28 February 2014. The case was scheduled for 21 March 2014. Following the case, many of the details surrounding his charges remained in virtual secrecy (a protective order was issued for the case, meaning that the details were not allowed to be disclosed to the public). However, there was an immense amount of evidences presented by the U.S. government against Zambada Ortiz the day of the case. U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw said that the case was \\"complex\\", and that this forced the deadlines of the case to be extended (it was unknown if more details from the charges were to be released to the public). This was likely due to the fact that Zambada Ortiz is not a typical defendant because he is the son of Ismael \\"El Mayo\\" Zambada, the leader of the Sinaloa Cartel and one of the world's most-wanted men. On April 2014, his case was moved to a federal district court in Los Angeles, California. Zambada Ortiz was expected to appear in court on 15 September 2014. However, on that date, the hearing was postponed to 5 December 2014. On 26 September 2014, Zambada pleaded guilty in San Diego to conspiring to buy 100 kilograms of cocaine and over 1,000 kilograms of marijuana in Sinaloa for U.S. distribution. As part of the agreement, he forfeited US$250,000 from the drug proceeds, and prosecutors dropped the methamphetamine charges Zambada was initially accused of. The session was held under heavy security with additional guards in the courtroom and metal detector entrances. Three female family members attended the court session. Zambada's defense attorney decline to comment on the case. In one of the rows, the attorney of Jos√© Rodrigo Ar√©chiga Gamboa (another high-ranking Sinaloa Cartel member implicated in Zambada's case) took notes. Zambada's sentence was scheduled for 22 May 2015; he faces from 10 years to life in prison with a US$10 million fine. Though Zambada Ortiz was registered as an inmate at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in San Diego since his arrest, it was leaked to the press in February 2015 that he was no longer there. Three months before pleading guilty of the charges, on 3 July 2014, sources within the MCC confirmed that had been transferred elsewhere. According to the prison's online database, Zambada Ortiz is not registered at the MCC. His register number 13069-408 at the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) says that he is not in custody. It was possible that Zambada Ortiz was taken from the MCC and introduced to the United States Federal Witness Protection Program. If that was the case, he was likely sent to a residence where he was kept under surveillance with a GPS electronic monitoring bracelet.  Sentence and release  Zambada Ortiz was sentenced to five and a half years in prison on 20 March 2018. While the prosecution stated that Zambada Ortiz's crimes were significant in nature, the hearing was devoid of the typical rhetoric of other high-profile drug-related cases, which include arguments of how much time a defendant should spend behind bars. The prosecution lowered his sentence from the minimum 10-year conviction because they considered that Zambada Ortiz's tumultuous youth, his \\"genuine remorse\\", the lack of violence in his criminal career, and the letters the prosecution received from his family and friends who described him as a helpful and kind person. During his hearing, Zambada Ortiz apologized for his crimes and stated that he realized that being involved in the drug trade negatively affected people's lives. He said he was ready to continue with his life and raise his two children with his wife. He also stated that he would finish his college education and help his mother's lychee and mango farm. On 11 September 2018, Zambada Ortiz was released from prison after fulfilling his time, only eight months after his sentence. He was initially scheduled to be released on 29 May 2019, but was able to get an early release due to good conduct and because of a letter his mother sent to the prosecution asking for a softer sentence.

He had many careers and avocations throughout his life, including farmer, cattle rancher, surveyor, and mineralogist. He also served as an engineer for the California Division of Highways for nearly 20 years. Biography =Early life= Costo was born in Hemet, California, and was raised on the nearby Cahuilla Reservation. He attended Riverside City College in the 1920s along with classmate John Gabbert, who ultimately became a Superior Court Judge.

He also served as a lobbyist fighting for Native American land rights for two years in Washington, D.C. and was a member of the American Indian Federation in the late 1930s. He founded the American Indian Historical Society in 1950 in an effort to ensure scholarly examination of Native American lives as opposed to the stereotypes so prevalent in United States' society at the time. As part of the same efforts, he and his wife, Jeannette Costo, founded the scholarly journal The Indian Historian as well as the popular press periodical Wassaja. The Costos founded the Indian Historian Press, a for-profit publishing house dedicated to publishing titles documenting or related to the Native American experience in the United States. =University of California, Riverside advocacy= Rupert Costo and his lifelong friend, Superior Court Judge John Gabbert, were key players in lobbying the University of California to establish a university in Riverside, California. = Marriage = Rupert Costo was married to Jeannette Henry Costo (1908‚Äì2001), a reporter for The New York Times, the Detroit Free Press, and The Plain Dealer, in 1954.

The James Ferguson House at 442 King St., Charleston, South Carolina, is an antebellum house dating to at least 1840 that is being used as a restaurant. The house was constructed for James Ferguson, a planter from Berkeley County, South Carolina. Subsequently, it was owned by the Amme family, well known locally for their bakery. The family renovated the house and added a Victorian storefront, giving it the appearance of a three-story building. By 1976, the house was in poor condition. The Charleston Board of Architectural Review approved its demolition subject to a 180-day delay; preservationists opposed the demolition as the house was an especially early building for upper King Street. Before the house was razed, two men bought it with the intent of turning it into a restaurant. However, the house was not restored until more than 20 years later when a neighboring property owner purchased it and restored it. The house became the location of Fish, a Charleston restaurant. The restoration returned the appearance of its front fa√ßade to the 1840s era.

Thomas Swartwout letter 1630 Early life Tomys Swartwout was born in 1607 in Groningen, Netherlands to Rolef Swartwout (1575‚Äì1634) and Catryna Swartwout (b. 1579). Swartwout was one of the earliest New Netherlanders to buy and sell American tobacco in the Netherlands. He started a wholesale tobacco business in Amsterdam, joining his older brothers, Wybrant and Herman, in 1629. New Amsterdam Swartwout and family left Amsterdam for New Netherland in March 1652. Swartwout, Jan Snedeker and Jan Stryker solicited from Director-General Peter Stuyvesant the right to settle together on the level reach of wild land (de vlacke bosch) or flat bush, adjacent to the outlying farms at Breukelen and Amersfoort. Through Swartwout's suggestion, the settlement was given the name of the village of Midwout. In April 1655, Stuyvesant and the Council of New Netherland appointed Swartwout a schepen (magistrate), to serve with Snedeker and Adriaen Hegeman as the Court of Midwout. Being one of the original settlers, Tomys Swartwout was granted letters-patent by the Council of New Netherland, Director-General Stuyvesant, and the Dutch West India Company of 116 acres on April 13, 1655. Swartwout was one of the nineteen signers of the \\"Humble Remonstrance and Petition of the Colonies and Villages of this New Netherland Province\\" sent to Stuyvesant on December 11, 1653, an important early document in the campaign for democracy in America. Following Adriaen Van Der Donck's Remonstrance of 1650 about governance of the colony, the document signed by Swartout set out discontents about Stuyvesant's authoritarian method of personally selecting, rather than electing, the council. The statement later inspired Jacob Leisler's campaign late in the 1680s for fuller representative democracy in New Amsterdam. Personal life In March 1630, he married Adrijejtjen Sijmons in Amsterdam. She died in child birth nine months later on December 17, 1630 after giving birth to their only child, Jan Swartwout. On June 3, 1631, he married Hendrickjen Otsen (b. 1609), with whom he would have several children, Roeloff (1634‚Äì1715), the founder of Kingston and Hurley, Barent, Tryntje, and Jacomijntje.

The school got an award from the king and was honoured by the Department of Education as an International Standard Quality School in 2011. The school is coeducational, teaches junior high school and high school level.  History  Prince Krom Phraya Damrong Rachanupab established the school as a primary school at Wat Klang, Paknam Muang, Samutprakarn on July 18, 1883. In 1900, ChaoPhraya Sadej Suren Tara Tippadee made it a high school. A separate school building was created that was the first school of public school of Samutprakan Province and it became Smutprakan School in 1902. Praya Racha Yusatok established another school building for girls in the temple which became Streesmutprakan School. In 1938, Streesmutprakan school was moved to a new site. It transferred the girl students to Smutprakan School. Then the school was opposite Pichai Songkram Temple and had an area of about three hectares. The school taught primary school level 3 to junior high school level 3 by Mrs Krasair RatanaWraha, who established the first two buildings of the school named RuenSangruji and Phinittantakit. In 1942, Miss Sobsamai Burawas, the principal of school at that time, developed the school and gained the trust of parents. More parents sent their children to study, so the school needed to expand. On 8 August 1956,the school was moved to the present site. The land was donated by Loung Prajerd Ugsornluk, who gave 8,000 square meters, and the school bought an additional 8,988 square meters of land with money from the Department of Education. Later on, the school received 760 square meters of land from Ms.Srisomboon Sittichai. The school now has a total area of 17,748 square meters.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. The building is planned to be used as a maritime museum slated to open in early 2017 History The town of Ludington (originally known as \\"Pere Marquette\\") was first platted in 1867. Population almost immediately boomed, in large part due to the planned construction of the Flint and Pere Marquette Railroad, which was completed in 1874. Ludington had over 2500 residents by that time, and the completion of the railroad spurred both passenger travel and freight shipment out of the harbor. In 1878, as shipping increased, Congress authorized four Lake Michigan life-saving stations, including one at Ludington. A station was built on the peninsula south of the harbor in 1879. The first crew came to the station in 1880. In 1884, the station was moved to the present site on the north side of the harbor, and a new structure built. However, by the 1930s, the station had outgrown the 1884 building. Plans for a new building were drawn up in 1932, and in 1933 the original station was moved to become a private residence. Over the next year, the set of building currently at the site were constructed. The Ludington station is nearly identical to the station built at Frankfort around the same time. In 1948, the Ludington station became headquarters for Coast Guard Group Ludington, which in 1955 absorbed the Grand Haven Group. However, in 1971 Coast Guard Group Ludington moved to Muskegon, and the Ludington facility was used as a search-and-rescue center, and in 1972 the boat launch ramps were removed and replaced with a concrete dock. Although the station declined in importance, its mission was re-evaluated in the wake of 9/11, and plans were made for a new station building. In 2003, ground was broken on a new station nearby, and the Coast Guard moved the next year. In 2007, the City of Ludington and the Mason County Historical Society agreed to create and operate a maritime museum in the 1933 building. The General Services Administration deeded the station to the city in 2010, and the future design began. Exterior renovations were made, and the 1933 station reopened as a maritime museum on Saturday, June 10, 2017. Description The Ludington Coast Guard Station is a large two to three-story wooden craftsman style structure, consisting of a broad hip-roof main block with a lower flat-roof rear extension; the entire structure measures 82 feet by 60 feet. The lower level is a concrete basement, serving as the first floor, while the upper levels are of wood construction and clad with wooden shingles. Broad hip-roof dormers project from each face of the hip roof. Fronting the water, two long flights of stairs lead to hip-roof entry porches on each corner of the second level. A low pent roof between the entrances marks the top of the three former boat bays. Windows are primarily single square-head window openings, with double wide ones above the doorways. On the rear (land facing) side, the extension has two wide entrances to the boathouse, with a smaller pedestrian door between. Round windows are inset above each door. A small addition fills the interior corner between the extension and the main structure. On the interior, the three-bay boathouse extends two stories in height, and runs through the center of the building. The remainder of the lower basement level contained a carpenter shop and storage areas. The second floor contained offices on one side of the boathouse and a galley and mess on the other. The third floor contained nine bunk rooms, two bathrooms, a TV/recreation room, and a large closet.

Example  Numba can be used by simply applying the \`numba.jit\` decorator to a Python function that does numerical computations: import numba import random @numba.jit def monte_carlo_pi(nsamples: int): acc = 0 for i in range(nsamples): x = random.random() y = random.random() if (x**2 + y**2) < 1.0: acc += 1 return 4.0 * acc / nsamples The Just-in-time compilation happens transparently when the function is called: >>> monte_carlo_pi(1000000) 3.14 The Numba website at https://numba.pydata.org contains many more examples, as well as information on how to get good performance from Numba.  GPU support  Numba can compile Python functions to GPU code. Currently two backends are available: * NVIDIA CUDA, see * AMD ROCm HSA, see  Alternative approaches  Numba is one approach to make Python fast, by compiling specific functions that contain Python and Numpy code. Many alternative approaches for fast numeric computing with Python exist, such as Cython, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Chainer, Pythran, and PyPy.

She captured several small Spanish privateers and participated in a major campaign before she was sold in 1811. Career Lieutenant James Pattison Stewart was appointed acting commander of Port d'Espagne on the Trinidad station on 15 April 1806.Marshall (1829), Supplement, Part 3, p.31. On 27 February 1807 Port d'Espagne and the brig captured the brig Altrevido, Nichola Val Pardo, master. The schooner shared by agreement in the prize money due Express. Three months later, on 6 June, 25 men from Port d'Espagne, under the command of Lieutenant Hall, succeeded in capturing the Spanish privateer schooner Mercedes in the Gulf of Paria. Mercedes was armed with two guns and two swivel guns, and had a crew of 30 men. Hall used a captured Spanish schooner disguised as a neutral vessel to get close to the Mercedes. The British came alongside, under fire, and captured the Mercedes after a brief fight. British casualties were two men wounded; Spanish casualties were two killed, one drowned, and three wounded. On 18 August Stewart and Port d'Espagne succeeded in capturing the Spanish privateer schooner Maria after a six-hour chase. She was armed with one long 18-pounder gun, had a crew of 74 men, was provisioned for a three-month cruise, and had left Margarita intending to cruise windward of Barbados. Stewart was particularly pleased to capture Maria as she was fast sailer in the Windward Islands and although on this cruise she had not made any captures, her captain had 14 years of successes in other privateers. Two days later, Ballahoo's boats, with the assistance of the Maria, destroyed a small privateer in the Bay of San Juan. Port d'Espagne and Ballahoo captured another small privateer, the Rosario, on 12 September in the same bay. The Rosario also was armed with one gun, and had a crew of 34, all of whom escaped on shore. Prize and head money for Mercede, Rosario, and the unnamed privateer were paid some 21 years later. Lastly, Port d'Espagna chased a privateer out of the Gulf of Paria and into the arms of the brig , which captured the Spaniard on 17 October. The Spanish privateer, of two guns, was the Nuestra Senora del Carmen. In late 1808 Stewart transferred to Snap, which he commissioned on 13 November. His replacement on Port d'Espagne was Lieutenant David Kennedy, of .Naval Chronicle, Vol. 21, p.174. Port d'Espagne participated in the British capture of the French and Dutch West Indies, including the capture of Martinique in February 1809. In 1847 the Admiralty authorized the issue of the Naval General Service Medal with the clasp \\"Martinique\\" to all remaining surviving claimants of that campaign. Lieutenant Colin Campbell was appointed to the command of Port d'Espagne on 22 September 1809. His replacement, by exchange, was Lieutenant Donald Campbell, who assumed command on 29 March 1810, and left on 22 September. On 21 October 1810, Lieutenant George Guy Burton became acting captain (pro tem) of Port d'Espagne. Commander James Black was promoted to Port d'Espagne with a commission dated 8 September 1810.Marshall (1829), Supplement, Part 3, p.127. It is not clear when he actually took command.

She is best known for her project Stranger Visions, a series of portraits created from DNA she recovered from discarded items, such as hair, cigarettes and chewing gum while living in Brooklyn, New York. From the extracted DNA, she determined gender, ethnicity and other factors and then used face-generating software and a 3D printer to create a speculative, algorithmically determined 3D portrait. While critical of technology and surveillance, her work has also been noted as provocative in its lack of legal precedent.Natalie Angley, \\"Artist creates faces from DNA left in public\\", CNN.com, September 4, 2013. Education Spurious Memories (2007) Dr. Dewey-Hagborg is an information and bio artist whose works explore the intersection between art and science. As a student in the Information Arts program at Bennington College, she participated in computer science classes, which laid the groundwork for the science-based artwork she would later envision using algorithms, electronics, and computer programming. She earned a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree in 2003. Dewey-Hagborg continued refining her work as an artist and computer programmer, studying artificial intelligence, while obtaining a Master of Professional Studies (M.P.S.) in Interactive Telecommunications from New York University (NYU) in 2007. It was here she curated a robotic performance art show called Robots on the March! in March 2005, and exhibited a piece called Lighter than Air: an experiment in constructing an autonomous flying robot. As a final project at NYU, Dewey- Hagborg explored the question \\"Can computers be creative?\\" in an exhibit she called Spurious Memories. She developed an autonomous face categorizing and generating software program which recognized facial components, made comparisons and adjustments, and produced unique representations of the human face through mass exposure to facial images. Dewey-Hagborg continued her education at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and graduated with a PhD in electronic arts in 2016. As an educator her areas of interest include art and technology, multimedia, digital photography, research-based art and programming, and computer science. Dewey-Hagborg worked as a teaching assistant at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, an adjunct professor at NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program, an adjunct professor at NYU's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, and taught art and technology studies at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. As of August 2019, Dewey-Hagborg lives and works in Abu Dhabi, and is a Visiting Assistant Professor of Interactive Media at NYU Abu Dhabi. Her courses include Communication and Technology, and Understanding Interactive Media, and Bioart Practices. Projects =Totem= Totem (2010) Dewey-Hagborg's Totem (2010) was a site- specific multimedia sculpture characterizing her earlier work. Totem, an idol, was designed to explore the implications of language and artificial intelligence using machine learning technology. Exploiting audio surveillance techniques to eavesdrop on and record conversations at the installation site, Dewey-Hagborg wrote algorithms to then isolate word sequences and grammatical structures into commonly used units. Influenced by Hebbian theory, she programmed the sculpture's computer to generate speech based on the most frequently occurring language structures in any given recording period. Over time, the least frequently elicited words or units would fade or be dropped from the sculpture's spoken vocabulary. The remaining units, stored in the sculpture's memory, were then spoken at random intervals. Martha Schwendener, of The New York Times, wrote that Totem showed promise, but, because of audio difficulties and its fragmented, randomly generated speech, the piece \\"failed to connect human speech, meaning, and technology in a profound fashion.\\" =Stranger Visions= Stranger Visions Portraits (2012) Stranger Visions (2012-2013) is a science-based, artistic exploration using DNA as a starting point for lifelike, computer generated 3-D portraits. She began this project questioning how much information could be understood about a person using genetic detritus left behind by strangers in New York City. \\"I was really struck by this idea that the very things that make us human - hair, skin, saliva, and fingernails - become a real liability for us as we constantly shed them in public. Anyone could come along and mine them for information.\\" She hoped, by producing realistic sculptures of anonymous people using clues from their DNA, to spark a debate about the use or the potential misuse of DNA profiling, privacy, and genetic surveillance. Stranger Visions portrait \\"Sample 2\\" based on the DNA sample from a cigarette butt collected on Myrtle Avenue in New York City, N.Y. Bushwick, Brooklyn, New York. Gum collected, that upon analysis revealed the genetic traits of a male of Native American and South American descent with brown eyes. As part of her research for Stranger Visions, she took a three-week crash-course in biotechnology at the Genspace laboratory in New York where she learned about the significant amount of personal information that an amateur biologist could learn about someone through biotech processes. She began the process of extracting DNA from the samples she collected. The extraction involves treating a hair sample, for example, with a gel that dissolves the hair, and a primer specifically developed to help locate characteristics like eye color or gender along the genome. She might repeat this process up to 40 times, looking for genetic variants influencing traits like eye color, hair color, and racial ancestry, in order to complete a portrait. Once the DNA strands are extracted from the samples, she then amplifies, or copies, specific regions of the genome, using a technique called Polymerase Chain Reaction, or PCR, a process advanced by Kary Mullis, a winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry (1993). These amplified regions of the genome make it possible to identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs (pronounced \\"snips\\"), which contain variables in the base pairs that give clues to a person's individual genetic make up (e.g., whether or not a person's eyes might be blue, brown or green). These results are then sent for analysis to a company for sequencing. She used 23andMe, a DNA analysis service, for Stranger Visions. Illustration of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) Stranger Visions portrait \\"Sample 3\\" Sample collected for Stranger Visions on Myrtle Avenue, Brooklyn, New York. The genetic blueprint she receives in return is a text file full of coded information identifying the unique positioning of the 4 nucleobases adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine, or ATC and G, that make up the sections of the genome she is interested in. This data is then entered into a customized computer program she wrote. The program interprets the code and provides her with a list of traits, including propensity for obesity, eye color, hair color, hair curl, skin tone, freckles, and gender. She then takes these traits, as many as 50, and enters them into a face-generating program to configure the 3-D portraits. Her previous experience with facial recognition algorithms gave her the ability to repurpose an existing facial recognition program, from Basel, Switzerland. She reworked the program to generate faces instead of just recognizing facial features. The resulting model changes facial dimensions (e.g., width of the nose and mouth) and characteristics with the genetic information it receives. Before making the final 3-D print, She generates several different versions of the face, finally choosing the one she finds most aesthetically pleasing. Critics of Dewey-Hagborg's Stranger Visions question whether or not the work crosses ethical and legal boundaries. They make a distinction between an artist's right to express societal concerns through artwork and the act of collecting personal, genetic information without informed consent. The fact that DNA samples are regularly \\"left behind\\" or abandoned does not mean those people have relinquished their interest in how that information is used. Some laws, like that of the Human Tissue Act of 2004 in the United Kingdom, prohibit private individuals from collecting biological samples for DNA analysis. What laws that exist to regulate the collection and use of DNA samples in the United States are not consistent among the states and rarely address the private sector. Only some states, like New York, outlaw most DNA testing without written consent. Others worry about the misuse of the information, fearing discrimination based on existing medical or mental health issues or a predisposition for disease- related illnesses or \\"unreasonable\\" searches of DNA evidence by law enforcement. One scientist and one gallery, according to Dewey-Hagborg, turned down her proposal fearing the project would \\"cause a fright\\" among people. Other critics focus on the growing do-it-yourself or biohacking movement. Supporters like Genspace's Ellen Jorgensen claim projects like Stranger Visions engage the public and make the new technology more accessible. Detractors fear unintended or unexpected consequences from unregulated experiments conducted by D.I.Y. amateur biologists developed in non- traditional laboratory settings. Still others, including Daniel MacArthur, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, John D. Hawks, an anthropologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Michelle N. Meyer, an academic fellow at the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology & Bioethics at Harvard Medical School, and Arthur Caplan, PhD, Director of the Division of Medical Ethics, N.Y.U., report that the technological capability to construct an accurate likeness of a human face based on DNA evidence is not currently available. Although it is possible to identify certain genetic markers linked to facial structures, scientists have yet to isolate all the genes and their variations needed to produce an accurate likeness with a computer simulation. Meyer, who analyzed the data from Dewey-Hagborg's website concludes: > So far as I can tell, she's working with sex; ancestral groups that are > usually very broad, and in any event only reflects half of the individual's > DNA (from which she presumably guesses hair color and texture and bone > structure); and a decent guess at eye color. There are hundreds of thousands > (at least) of people who would fit these descriptions even if each of her > phenotype predictions were accurate, and in many cases, one or more of the > predictions are probably going to be wrong. The environment, the probabilistic nature of interpreting the DNA data collected, and limitations of computer technology all influence the outcome. She likens her work to that of a sketch artist. At most, her portraits bear only a vague, family resemblance to the people whose genetic information was used as a foundation for the portraits. Stranger Visions was on view in the exhibition Mutations-Cr√©ations / Imprimer le Monde and is in the permanent collection of Centre Pompidou in Paris, France. A public version of the genetic profiling code is available on github . Invisible (2014) In 2013, Dewey-Hagborg was contacted by an assistant medical examiner in Delaware, as a result of her work with Stranger Visions. The project involved developing a portrait of an unidentified woman whose case has remained unsolved for 20 years. She agreed to be an adviser to assist with the case. Though the resulting portrait based on the unidentified woman's DNA could only be as accurate as existing technology allowed, leaving room for speculation, Dewey- Hagborg viewed working on the case as the only potential use for this type of face-generating technology. \\"If you can add anything at all to her description, if you can increase the possibility her loved ones may find her even one little bit I think it's worth it.\\" Critics of Dewey-Hagborg's involvement in the Delaware case express concern for what they call \\"D.I.Y. forensic science\\" and question the role of civilians in state investigations. =Invisible= Invisible (2014) Dewey-Hagborg's work with Stranger Visions and interest in issues surrounding genetic surveillance lead to the development of two products whose purpose is to eliminate DNA traces. The first, Erase, is a bleaching spray that cleans surfaces (e.g., cups, silverware) of DNA evidence. The second, Replace, is a spray consisting of a blend of genes designed to introduce foreign DNA evidence to the surface, therefore masking any of the original DNA remaining in that area. Dewey- Hagborg views these as a \\"citizens' defense against the looming DNA surveillance state.\\" =Collaboration with Chelsea Manning= In the summer of 2017 Dewey-Hagborg's collaborative exhibition with transgender activist Chelsea E. Manning A Becoming Resemblance opened at Fridman Gallery in New York City, curated by Roddy Schrock . For the exhibition, Dewey-Hagborg created 3-D printed portraits of Manning, based on cheek swabs and hair clippings that Manning sent her while incarcerated for leaking classified information to WikiLeaks. Dewey-Hagborg created Probably Chelsea, 30 portraits based on Manning's maternal DNA, their variances in skin color and features presents the malleability of DNA data, and Radical Love, two portraits out of many that Manning selected because they best conveyed her appearance at the time of her gender transformation within maximum security prison, which did not allow photography. The installation demonstrated how much the human genome is up for interpretation once condensed and subjectively interpreted.\\" Probably Chelsea has since traveled to numerous institutions for exhibition, including Transmediale 2018: Face Value, January-April 2018 in Berlin, MU Art Space, Genomic Intimacy, May-July 2018 in Eindhoven, Netherlandshttp://www.mu.nl/en/exhibitions/heather-dewey-hagborg-genomic- intimacy and Perth Institute of Contemporary Art, Hyperprometheus, October- December, 2018 . Probably Chelsea is in the permanent museum collection of the Exploratorium in San Francisco, California . Radical Love is on view in the permanent collections of the New York Historical Society and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London .

His father owned a souvenir store in Miami Beach where Cayre worked as a teenager. He has two brothers: Stanley and Kenneth.Disco-Disco Interview with Kenneth Cayre retrieved November 25, 2013 Career In 1959, Cayre and his brothers started their first business operating a duty-free retail store, the Paris Freeport Shop, on a cruise ship then owned by a friend that made a daily trip from Miami to the Bimini, Bahamas and back. They operated the store until 1967 when the ship was retired. Although still partners, the brothers engaged in separate business activities partnering with cousins from Mexico: Stan opened a textile factory in Puerto Rico Swan Tricot Mills; in 1963, Ken opened a ladies pantyhose factory, Kandy Mills, in Hialeah, Florida; and Joseph opened a plastic injection molding machine factory making 8-track cassette tape cartridges. When their cousins - who had purchased the exclusive 8-track distribution rights in Mexico for the Spanish music portfolio of RCA and CBS - had excess inventory, the Cayre brothers would sell it in Spanish language markets in the USA. After being requested to stop selling in the USA by both CBS and RCA (since the cousins only had the right to distribute in Mexico), the Cayre brothers, selling their textile interests to their Mexican cousins, purchased the exclusive 8-track Spanish language distribution rights from both CBS and RCA; within a year, they also acquired the same distribution rights for Spanish music LP records. In 1972, they founded their music distribution business, Caytronics Distributing in New York City. =Salsoul Records= As Salsa music was very popular in New York City owing to its large Puerto Rican population and the fact that their portfolio was mostly Mexican-oriented music, the Cayre brothers started their own Salsa focused record label called Mericana Records. They were able to sign Joe Bataan away from their main competitor, Fania Records; Bataan subsequently released an album called SalSoul (a combination of Salsa and Soul). The record was purchased by CBS Records for $100,000. They took the money and put together the SalSoul Orchestra in Philadelphia (with Earl Young on drums, Ronnie Baker on bass, Norman Harris and Bobby Eli on guitar, Bunny Sigler and Ron Kersey on keyboards, Vincent Montana, Jr. on vibes, and Larry Washington on the congas) and recorded three songs including the SalSoul Hustle which was an immediate hit. Their new label Salsoul Records focused on the dance market at the same time that Disco music was becoming popular. The label produced 8 to 10 records per month in the late 1970s. In 1976, Salsoul released the first commercially available 12-inch single, Double Exposure's Ten Percent. Salsoul Records also manufactured and distributed Gold Mind Records' output. Salsoul was affected by The disco backlash of 1979, but it was one of the few labels to survive after the death of disco. It continued to release new material until 1984 when the Cayre brothers shut down their recorded music operations to concentrate on the home video business. =GoodTimes Entertainment= In 1984, they founded GoodTimes Home Video Corporation (eventually renamed GoodTimes Entertainment) with 25 Public Domain video titles. They expanded into the production and distribution of low-priced fitness videos although its most recognized line of products were a series of low-budget traditionally animated films. Many of its home-video titles (such as Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, Jungle Book, Hercules, Pocahontas, Cinderella, The Little Mermaid, Sinbad, and Thumbelina) were named similarly or identically to big-budget animated films from other studiosIMDB list of GoodTimes films Retrieved on March 12, 2013 (though their plots were sometimes very different), and released close to the theatrical or home-video releases of the other studios. Walt Disney Pictures sued GoodTimes because the packaging of the GoodTimes videotapes closely resembled that of Disney potentially confusing customers into buying a GoodTimes movie when they thought they were buying a Disney movie. As a result of that lawsuit, GoodTimes was required to print its name atop its VHS covers, but it was still allowed to produce animated films.Bangor Daily News: \\"Disney loses suit over 'Good Times' Aladdin video\\" by Peter M.

Known as the \\"poor man's economist\\", he drafted, authored and co-authored laws to improve the lot of the peasantry. As a member of Congress, he took particular pride in the sponsorship of almost all laws on land reform. He is also considered to be the \\"Father of the Philippine banking system\\" because of his authorship and involvement in almost all the major finance and tariff measures since the beginning of the Third Philippine Republic in 1946. Early life Roy was born and raised in Moncada, Tarlac. His family were tenant farmers and he attended public schools. As a young boy, his first ambition was to become a writer and one of the topics he wrote on for a school paper was crop-sharing. Seeing and much affected by the oppression surrounding the farmers around him, he thought crop-sharing would be the best remedy for the life of disparity that existed between the wealthy landlords and the poverty-stricken tenant farmers. Roy worked his way through college and graduated from the University of the Philippines with an LLB degree in 1930. With his knowledge of Spanish, English, Filipino, Ilocano and Pampango, he was able to support himself through law school by working as an interpreter in the Public Service Commission. After graduation, he continued working at the PSC where he later became a special attorney specializing in transportation. At that time, he was just one of three public utility practitioners who specialized in transportation. In 1936, the mining boom came and Roy expanded his practice to become a corporate lawyer. He organized mining corporations. His career flourished until the Second World War broke out. Political career After the war, in 1946, the first elections were held. The presidential candidate of the Liberal party was Manuel A. Roxas. Roxas persuaded Roy to run for Congress. Roy agreed only after being promised that if they won, Roxas would consider supporting the 70-30 Rice Crop-Sharing law he was planning to author. This law would provide that 70% of the rice crop be given to the tenant farmers and 30% to the landowners in all rice-producing regions of the Philippines and, after studying the matter, Roxas found that it had its merits. The 1946 election was a very difficult one. Roy was elected to represent the 1st district of Tarlac, but he the lone Liberal Party candidate to win in Central Luzon. Over the next 16 years, Roy was re-elected to four consecutive terms as congressman of the 1st District. He was instrumental in the drafting and passage of important finance and socio-economic measures which he authored or sponsored. Among them were the Central Bank Act, Rehabilitation Finance Corporation (R.A.85), Development Bank of the Philippines, Philippine Veterans Bank Act (R.A. 3518), the Philippines Deposit Insurance Corporation Act (R.A.3591); the Industrialization Act (R.A.901); The Agricultural Tenancy Act, The Land Tenure Act, The Original Anti-Graft Law and the Tariff and Customs Code of 1957 among others. He was also a member of the Council of Leaders, the Development Council, the Council of State and the Security Council. In the general election of 1961, Roy was elected as a senator for the Fifth Congress. He was one of only two Nacionalista Party senatorial candidates who were elected. In his 1967 re-election bid, the Nacionalista Party won seven of the eight possible seats in a senate race of which he topped, enjoying more than half a million votes over his nearest pursuer from the same party. As senator, Roy was elected as the Majority Floor Leader of the Sixth Congress in 1966. In 1967, he became the President Pro- tempore of the Seventh Congress and a member of the Commission on Appointments. As President Pro-tempore, Roy urged then President Ferdinand Marcos to reduce the power of various political warlords throughout the country by forcing them to disband their private armies and His efforts failed, however, and the Seventh Congress was eventually abolished when Marcos declared martial law in 1972. Other Roy had the distinction of being the only legislator in both houses to serve continuously for 25 years. He never lost an election and was the only member of Congress who was chosen as one of the ten best congressmen each year from 1948 to 1961 by civic organizations, members of the press and national periodicals. An experienced speaker and debater who had a knack for explaining the intricacies of economics, banking and finance in terms understandable to the masses, he was quite popular with the Filipino people. In his time, Roy was a frequent delegate to international conferences. He represented the country as a delegate to the United Nations in 1950, 1952, 1968 and 1969. ln 1952, he was a delegate to the International Monetary Fund and World Bank Conference in Mexico City, and to Washington DC in 1954 and 1956. He also went to the United States as a delegate of the Philippine Economic Mission for the revision of the Phil-US Trade Act in Washington DC in 1954 and was an official guest of the British Government for a goodwill tour of the United Kingdom in 1958. Outside of public service, Roy remained a stalwart of the Philippine Bar by becoming one of the moving spirits of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines and being elected president of the Philippine Lawyers Association in 1968, while managing Jose J. Roy and Associates Law Offices. Roy was also a member of the Philippine Historical Society, the Knights of Rizal as well as a lifetime member of several veterans‚Äôorganizations and he even once served as president of the Philippine Philatelic Association. He was the chairman of the 5th General Conference of the World Anti-Communist League and a member of the Asian People Anti- Communist League. Roy also served as chairman of the board of trustees of the Angeles University Foundation, a university in Angeles, Pampanga. Personal life Roy was married to Consolacion R. Domingo and had three children, Jose Jr., Vilma and Ronald. Death He died in 1986.

His name is also spelt Whitelocke (which was preferred by his father) and Whitlock. Phyllis Court, Henley-on-Thames Early life Whitelock was the second son of Sir Bulstrode Whitelocke (1605‚Äì1675), parliamentarian and one of Oliver Cromwell's Commissioners of the Great Seal of England. He was the first son of his father's second wife, Frances Willoughby (died 1649), a daughter of William Willoughby, 3rd Baron Willoughby of Parham. As a young man Whitelock joined the Middle Temple in 1647 and was called to the bar in 1655. He married, in 1671, Mary Overbury, the daughter of Sir Thomas Overbury of Bourton on the Hill, Gloucestershire. Parliamentary career In 1659 Whitelock was elected to the short-lived Third Protectorate Parliament called by Richard Cromwell, but sat for only one session, from 27 January to 22 April 1659, as one of the two members of parliament for Westlow in Cornwall. After Cromwell had dissolved this parliament in April, he recalled the earlier Rump Parliament, in which Whitelock was not a member. In 1660 the Commonwealth collapsed, and the House of Stuart was restored. He succeeded his father at Phillis Court, Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, in 1675. Whitelock did not return to parliament until shortly after the Glorious Revolution. He was appointed a King's Counsel to William of Orange in 1689 until 1695, and was knighted on 10 April 1689. In December 1689 he won the by- election at Great Marlow caused by the death of John Hoby, becoming one of the borough's two Members in the House of Commons of England. A few months later, at the general election of 1690, he was elected for Great Marlow again and sat for it until the 1695 English general election. In 1702 he was appointed Queen's Counsel for Queen Anne.Humphry William Woolrych, Eminent Serjeants-at- law of the English bar (vol. I, 1869), p. 381 At a by-election on 22 November 1703 caused by the departure of Heneage Finch for the House of Lords, Whitelock was elected to represent the High Tory constituency of the University of Oxford. After the Union of England and Scotland in 1707, he continued to represent the University in the enlarged House of Commons of Great Britain. He was returned again at the 1708 British general election and at the 1710 British general election. At the 1715 British general election Whitlocke was returned unopposed for the University of Oxford, and described as ‚Äòa recognised Jacobite‚Äô in the list of that Parliament drawn up for George I. He was also described as being well heard by the House of Commons, ‚Äòcar il ne manque jamais de faire rire‚Äô (because he never fails to raise a laugh). He spoke against the Address in March 1715. In August with Shippen, Sir William Wyndham, and John Hungerford he was one of the only Tory speakers against the impeachment of the late Tory ministers. He also spoke against the septennial bill in April 1716. Later life and legacy Whitelock died at Phillis Court on 22 November 1717 and was buried at Fawley, Buckinghamshire, the principal family estate. He left five sons and eight daughters. His death was reported as follows: Whitelock was an extreme Tory, and fond of old fashions. On one occasion, he was speaking in the House of Commons and said \\"as black as ‚Äì \\", to be interrupted by an opponent with \\"your shoe-strings!\\" Whitelock replied \\"Sir, I remember when there were more shoe-strings and fewer coxcombs in this assembly!\\" On another occasion, in 1714, Whitelock began a speech in the Commons with a reference to the Elector of Hanover: \\"If he ever comes to the throne, which I hope he never will...\\" This was met with angry shouts from the Whigs and by demands for him to take his words back. Whitelock replied calmly that Queen Anne was younger than her appointed heir and that he hoped she would outlive him.

It is approximately long. The upper reaches of the creek are located in Weiser State Forest, between Big Mountain and Little Mountain. The creek is home to some trout and is considered a high-quality coldwater fishery. The Chemung Formation occurs in the creek's watershed. The watershed is 25 square miles in area. Course South Branch Roaring Creek starts at the eastern edge of Conyngham Township in Columbia County between Big Mountain and Little Mountain. The creek starts flowing in a westward direction. It passes under Pennsylvania Route 42 and goes through a lake. After exiting the lake, it reaches another lake and exits Columbia County. Upon exiting Columbia County, South Branch Roaring Creek flows along the border between Mount Carmel Township in Northumberland County, and Columbia County. It continues heading west before passing briefly into Coal Township and turning north. While heading north, South Branch Roaring Creek flows between Cleveland Township, Columbia County to the east and Northumberland County to the west. As the creek passes by Knoebels Grove, it picks up its tributary Mugser Run. It then enters Franklin Township and passes under Pennsylvania Route 487. Shortly afterwards, the creek flows into Roaring Creek. Hydrology The waters of South Branch Roaring Creek are used as a water supply. There are four reservoirs on the creek. The reservoirs are, going downstream, the Brush Valley Reservoir, the Bear Gap #6 Reservoir, the Bear Gap #2 Reservoir, and the Bear Gap #1 Reservoir. The creek is dammed in four locations for the purpose of providing water to people in Shamokin and Mount Carmel. The pH of South Branch Roaring Creek ranges from 5.5 to 7. This is due to the geology near the creek's headwaters, acid rain, and organic acids in the watershed. In October and November 2007, volunteers from the Roaring Creek Valley Conservation Association performed a visual assessment of the quality of South Branch Roaring Creek, ranking seven attributes on a scale of 0 to 4, with 4 being highest-quality, thus meaning that 28 would be a perfect score. One location on the creek had a score of 24 out of 28, making it the second highest-scoring site in the watershed, behind one site on Roaring Creek. The other sites on South Branch Roaring Creek had scores of 21.5 and 16.5, and a tributary of the creek had a score of 21. In the summer of 2006, the water temperature in South Branch Roaring Creek ranged from to . The pH ranged from 5.38 to 6.41. The conductance ranged from 35 to 146 micro-siemens, with an average of 82 micro-siemens. The concentration of alkalinity ranged from 7 to 19 milligrams per liter, with an average of 11.8 milligrams per liter. In the summer of 2006, the discharge of South Branch Roaring Creek was 32.9 liters per second and 33.3 liters per second in two sites, and 142.3 liters per second in a third site. The nitrogen concentration in South Branch Roaring Creek as of 2006 ranged from 209 to 1155.5 micrograms per liter, with an average of 546.6 micrograms per liter. The phosphorus concentration in South Branch Roaring Creek as of 2006 ranged from 12.6 micrograms per liter to 26.4 micrograms per liter, with an average of 17.6 micrograms per liter. Geography The first of South Branch Roaring Creek are situated in the Roaring Creek tract of Weiser State Forest, with Big Mountain to the north and Little Mountain to the south. The Chemung formation rock beds are exposed near South Branch Roaring Creek. The creek cuts through Little Mountain at one point. The Selinsgrove axis crosses the creek as well. The valley where the upper part of the creek is located, between Big Mountain and Little Mountain, is composed of red shale. Watershed The watershed of South Branch Roaring Creek is roughly L-shaped. The northwestern edge of the watershed is several miles north of Elysburg and the southeastern edge is several miles east of Aristes. Springs with sand bottoms are located near the headwaters. Part of Weiser State Forest is in the watershed. The South Branch Roaring Creek watershed is 25 square miles in area. Adjacent watersheds include the Mugser Run watershed, the Lick Run watershed, and the main watershed of Roaring Creek. Biology Both brown trout and brook trout live in South Branch Roaring Creek. Both of these fish can grow up to long. The total concentration of trout ranges from per hectare to per hectare and per hectare. The species of fish observed in the creek as of 2004 are mostly typical for a stream environment in that area. These included eastern blacknose dace, margined madtoms, and various warm-water fish which had swum into the creek from the reservoirs on it. Catch and release public fishing is permitted on the creek. It is an approved trout stream. Several species of concern live near the creek's headwaters. The headwaters are also home to a Hemlock Palustrine Forest Natural Community. The northern long-eared bat has been observed on the creek. The forests in the upper reaches of South Branch Roaring Creek help connect forests in the Pocono Mountains to those on the Susquehanna River. In the summer of 2006, the canopy coverage on the creek was 40% at two sites and 93% at a third site. The upper reaches of South Branch Roaring Creek have been described as \\"the best natural habitat in the [Columbia] county\\". South Branch Roaring Creek is considered a high-quality cold-water fishery and a Class A wild trout stream. The microinvertebrates that live at one site in South Branch Roaring Creek include 19 taxa, such as Hydropsychidae and Philopotamidae. Two species are considered abundant, one is considered common, nine are considered present, and seven are considered rare. The Hilsenhoff Pollution Tolerance Score of these microinvertebrates range from 0 (with two species) to 10 (with Oligochaeta). In another site, a total of 21 taxa of microinvertebrates have been observed. Hydropsychidae and Philopotamidae are the most abundant. Two species are considered abundant, two are considered common, ten are considered present, and seven are considered rare. The Hilsenhoff Pollution Tolerance Score of these microinvertebrates range from 0 in two cases to 9 in Turbellaria and 10 in Oligochaeta. The total algal biomass (as measured in micrograms of chlorophyll per square centimeter) in the creek as of 2006 ranged from 0.9 to 3.81, with an average of 2.07.

Artists and designers from home and abroad present light art and design applications by using new media technologies, such as computers, sensors, animations, and also the well-known projection techniques. The GLOW festival was held for the first time in November 2006. The festival is an outdoor exhibition in public space of national and international light artists. The light artworks are connected by a walking route of approximately 5 kilometres which runs through the city centre. During the festival artworks can be seen in the city and on the banks of the Dommel. The festival route changes every year to give attention to different areas and neighborhoods of Eindhoven. GLOW-Next is all about brand new light projects that are exhibited for the first time. In Eindhoven, engineers, designers, scientists and artists work together to create innovative light concepts and -techniques as well as new insights. In 2016 these projects were exhibited at the Eindhoven University of Technology campus for celebrating the 60th anniversary of its founding. Eindhoven was known as the City of Light before Philips existed. For many years it was the largest producer of matches, possibly because of the local tobacco industry. Due also to the Incandescent light bulb production by Philips in Eindhoven, the city has always had something to do with light. The city also has a strong presence of local developments and lighting research, including De-Escalate, a laboratory that is a collaboration of the Intelligent Lighting Institute and the Technical University.

The tablets invoke the intercession of the goddess Sulis Minerva in the return of stolen goods and to curse the perpetrators of the thefts. Inscribed mostly in British Latin, they have been used to attest to the everyday spoken vernacular of the Romano-British population of the second to fourth centuries A.D. They have also been recognised by UNESCO in its Memory of the World UK Register. Discovery and description The Roman baths at Bath ‚Äî the entire structure above the level of the pillar bases is post-Roman. The Roman baths and temple dedicated to the goddess Sulis Minerva in the English city of Bath (founded by the Romans as Aquae Sulis) were excavated between 1978 and 1983 by a team led by Barry Cunliffe and Peter Davenport. In 1979/1980, around 130 tablets were discovered in an excavation of the \\"Sacred Spring\\" under the King's Bath. The spring had been temporarily diverted to facilitate the excavation, revealing a huge array of Roman era items including the tablets. The tablets, some in a fragmentary state, were small and rectangular and initially were assumed to be made of lead, although subsequent metallurgical analysis revealed that they are, in fact, made of lead alloyed with tin, with occasional traces of copper. Some of the tablets were cast under pressure into thin, flexible sheets with a finish as smooth as paper whereas others appear to have been roughly hammered out from a molten lump.Tomlin, Roger \\"Writing and Communication\\", p.152 in Most of the tablets were inscribed, either with Roman capitals or with cursive script, but the expertise of the lettering varied. Some of the tablets had markings that appear to be an illiterate imitation of lettering, for example repetitive lines of crosses or sevens, and some were completely blank. The inscriptions on the tablets were published in full in 1988 by historian Roger Tomlin. The tablets themselves are on public display at the Roman Baths Museum in Bath. Inscriptions Gilt bronze head of Sulis Minerva, to whom the curse tablets were addressed, found at her temple in Bath. The tablets were identified as ‚Äúcurse tablets‚Äù dating from the second to fourth centuries A.D. Curse tablets are small metal sheets inscribed with curses against specific people and were used in popular magic throughout the Roman world. =Language= Most of the inscriptions are in colloquial Latin, and specifically in the Vulgar Latin of the Romano-British population, known as \\"British Latin\\". Two of the inscriptions are in a language which is not Latin, although they use Roman lettering, and may be in a British Celtic language. If this should be the case, they would be the only examples of a written ancient British Celtic language; however, there is not yet scholarly consensus on their decipherment. =Content= All but one of the 130 Bath curse tablets concern the restitution of stolen goods and are a type of curse tablet known as \\"prayers for justice\\". The complained of thefts are generally of personal possessions from the baths such as jewellery, gemstones, money, household goods and especially clothing. Theft from public baths appears to have been a common problem as it was a well-known Roman literary stereotype and severe laws existed to punish the perpetrators. Most of the depositors of the tablets (the victims of the thefts) appear to have been from the lower social classes. The inscriptions generally follow the same formula, suggesting it was taken from a handbook: the stolen property is declared as having been transferred to a deity so that the loss becomes the deity‚Äôs loss; the suspect is named and, in 21 cases, so is the victim; the victim then asks the deity to visit afflictions on the thief (including death) not as a punishment but to induce the thief to hand the stolen items back. The deity whose help was invoked is Sulis, and the tablets were deposited by the victims in the spring that was sacred to her. =Examples= Curse tablet with complaint about theft of a cloak and bathing tunic A typical example reads: ::\\"Solinus to the goddess Sulis Minerva. I give to your divinity and majesty [my] bathing tunic and cloak. Do not allow sleep or health to him who has done me wrong, whether man or woman or whether slave or free unless he reveals himself and brings those goods to your temple.\\" EDCS-ID: EDCS-17900027. The formula \\"whether man or woman or whether slave or free\\" is typical, and the following example is unusual in two respects. Firstly it adds the words \\"whether pagan or Christian\\" and secondly the text was written in reversed lettering: ::\\"Whether pagan or Christian, whether man or woman, whether boy or girl, whether slave or free whoever has stolen from me, Annianus [son of] Matutina (?), six silver coins from my purse, you, Lady Goddess, are to exact [them] from him. If through some deceit he has given me...and do not give thus to him but reckon as (?) the blood of him who has invoked his upon me.\\" Many name the suspected thieves: Curse tablet with complaint about the theft of Vilbia ::\\"I have given to the goddess Sulis the six silver coins which I have lost. It is for the goddess to exact [them] from the names written below: Senicianus and Saturninus and Anniola.\\" Some of the inscriptions are very specific in the afflictions requested and reveal the intensity of the victim's anger: ::\\"Docimedis has lost two gloves and asks that the thief responsible should lose their minds [sic] and eyes in the goddess' temple.\\" ::\\"May he who carried off Vilbia from me become liquid as the water. May she who so obscenely devoured her become dumb\\" ::\\"...so long as someone, whether slave or free, keeps silent or knows anything about it, he may be accursed in (his) blood, and eyes and every limb and even have all (his) intestines quite eaten away if he has stolen the ring or been privy (to the theft).\\" Curse tablet thought to have text in British Celtic One of the suspected British Celtic inscriptions has been translated as: ::\\"The affixed ‚Äì Deuina, Deieda, Andagin, (and) Uindiorix ‚Äì I have bound\\" An alternative translation of the above inscription is: ::\\"May I, Windiorix for/at Cuamena defeat (alt. summon to justice) the worthless woman, oh divine Deieda.\\" Significance The Bath curse tablets are the most important record of Romano-British religion yet published. Curse tablets are of particular use in evidencing the Vulgar Latin of everyday speech, and, since their publication in 1988, the Bath inscriptions have been used as evidence of the nature of British Latin. Additionally, the contents of the inscriptions have been used as evidence of popular attitudes to crime and the system of justice.

LEDBAT is described in RFC 6817. Design goals LEDBAT congestion control has the following goals: # Use all available bandwidth, and to maintain a low queueing delay when no other traffic is present, # Limit the queuing delay it adds to that induced by other traffic, and # To yield quickly to standard TCP that share the same bottleneck link. Implementations and deployment The two main implementations are uTP by BitTorrent and as part of TCP by Apple. BitTorrent uses uTP for most traffic and makes the code available under an open-source license.Libutp - The uTorrent Transport Protocol library, Retrieved November 24, 2013 Apple uses LEDBAT for Software Updates so that large software downloads to Mac OS X computers and iOS devices do not interfere with normal user activities; Apple also makes the source code available. Both of the above implementations aim to limit the network queuing delay to 100ms. This is the maximum allowed for by the standardized protocol. If one used a lower value, then it would be starved when the other was in use. Windows 10 Anniversary Update introduced support for LEDBAT via undocumented socket option as an experimental Windows TCP Congestion Control Module and Windows Server 2019 Example Assumptions: # The clocks of the sender and the receiver are not synchronized # The sender sends at a fixed rate The sender sends 5 packets of data every 10 clock counts: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50. The units are unimportant. The receiver is receiving data not only from this particular sender but also from other sources. For the 5 packets that were sent, the receiver receives them at the following clock counts: 112, 135, 176, 250, 326. The first differences (one way delay) between the received and sent clock counts are: 102, 115, 146, 210, 276. The second differences (change in one way delay) are: 13 (115 - 102), 31, 64 and 66.

He was also a highly skilled botanist and linguist. Many people view him as a pioneer in medical missions for his founding of the hospital in Lovedale, starting a medical school, and developing the founding scheme of the South African Native College, now the University of Fort Hare. He was Moderator of the General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland 1899/1900 and oversaw the Union of 1900.  Early life  He was born in Edinburgh, Scotland on 14 February 1831. He was educated at the Royal High School, Edinburgh. After his father remarried the family moved to a farm near Scone and James finished his education at Perth Academy. At the age of 15 he decided that he wanted to be a missionary. He studied at Edinburgh University and St Andrews University then trained as a Free Church minister at New College, Edinburgh. The church considered him suitable as a medical missionary and sent him to Glasgow University to train as a physician. In 1865 he graduated M.B. and C.M. and graduated with distinctions in surgery, material medical, and forensic medicine. He became a missionary in February 1865 for the Free Church of Scotland, sanctioned by the Free Presbytery of Glasgow.Ewing, William Annals of the Free Church Stewart was described by some as \\"more as a friend than as a doctor\\" towards his patients. Stewart grew up with both his mother and father, but his mother died while he was a teenager and his father remarried. His mother was part of the Dudgeon sept of the Noresmen. His mother was thought to be a major influence in Stewart‚Äôs life from whom he received his love and appreciation for beauty. He was a cab proprietor and later ran a farm called Pictstonhill near Scone in Perthshire. At the Disruption of 1843 his father allowed the newly created Free Church to preach in his barn while they awaited their church being built. He was a very religious man and influenced Stewart towards missionary work. Stewart had a desire from a young age to go to Africa. He told his cousin, \\"I shall never be satisfied till I am in Africa with a Bible in my pocket, and a rifle on my shoulder to supply my wants.\\"  Journey to Africa  On 13 August 1861, James Stewart traveled to Cape Town with Livingstone's wife. On his first journey there, he became ill with a fever. When he arrived in Africa he teamed up with David Livingstone, a Scottish missionary who was a national hero in Britain for his medical work. Stewart soon returned to Europe to complete his education, then returned to Lovedale in South Africa in 1867 after marrying his wife, Mina Stephen. = Views on Africa = Stewart thought that Africa was lagging behind other nations. When he first traveled in Africa, he observed that magic and medicine were intertwined, which he felt made African medicine inferior to European medicine. He felt that medicine in Africa had a very large presence, but he also felt that it had many malignant effects. He learned some of the natives‚Äô medicine, but thought that European medicine should take precedence over native medicine. He also had many negative views about the African natives. He felt there were no moral forces present in the African natives' lives. He warned people who went there of \\"descent into mere animalism and fixed and hopeless barbarism,\\" showing how he viewed the lives of the Africans as inferior to his life. He was also worried about their moral degradation because of polygamy and witchcraft. Stewart thought that this degradation process was reversible through mission help. He aimed at fixing their decline through his missionary work in Africa. Stewart also implicitly suggested that Africans were racially inferior to Europeans, both physically and biologically. Even though at first James Stewart had many negative views on Africans, he did not treat them as inferiors and did everything he could to help them. = Lovedale = In 1864 Stewart was selected by the Free Church of Scotland to work at Lovedale, which was a mission and a school 700 miles north-east of Cape Town and 80 miles away from the Indian Ocean. He took charge in 1866 and was asked to be principal in 1867. Jane Elizabeth Waterston was employed to create an institution for girls. Lovedale was supported financially by the Free Church of Scotland. At the time Stewart arrived Lovedale had a staff of more than twenty-four Europeans. Stewart became the principal of Lovedale in 1867 and maintained this position for 40 years; as a result, he was given the name Stewart of Lovedale. He made Lovedale the best school in Africa by adopting the school to the natives‚Äô needs. For example, instead of teaching them Latin and Greek, he taught them English, which was a much more useful language for them. Stewart also had many different goals for Lovedale which he described in his book Dawn in the Dark Continent: # To take young men of intellectual and spiritual qualifications and train them to be preachers. # To train young men and women as teachers for native mission schools. # To give education in various industrial arts, such as carpentering, waggon-making, blacksmithing, printing, bookbinding, telegraphy, and agricultural work of various kinds, to natives, that they may become industrious and useful citizens.\\" # To give a general education of an elementary kind to all whose course in life has not been definitely determined\\" Through these goals Stewart aimed at providing a complete education, which also prepared the students for the workforce. During Stewart's time at Lovedale, he also erected a small hospital. Stewart became Principal of Lovedale in 1870. = Livingstonia = In 1875, the Free Church of Scotland founded Livingstonia in honor of the well-known Scottish doctor, David Livingstone and asked Stewart to run it. They did this because he wanted to continue the work of Dr. Livingstone. He wanted Livingstonia to be on the shores of Lake Malawi, and received financial backing from a group of Glasgow businessmen. He wanted it independent from the Free Church Foreign Mission authorities. The mission was located at the south end of the lake at Cape Maclear and opened in October 1875. The mission focused on improving (or providing) housing and diet (or food) as a way to promote health. Livingstonia became the most important mission in the region, until the First World War. He was replaced by Rev Dr Robert Laws.  Medical mission work  During Stewart‚Äôs time in Africa he learned a lot of valuable information about Africa and the natives' ways, for example, information about the medical properties of different plants. He also observed many medicine men. Stewart decided that the best way to treat Africans was by combining Western medicine with their own practices, such as those of the medicine men. None of the missionaries who preceded James Stewart in South Africa, such as Dr. Venderkemp and Dr. Livingtsone, had focused on the medical aspect of missionary work. Stewart, however, felt that it was equally important. While Stewart was working in South Africa he was one of only five legal medical missionaries there. Stewart was the first of them to found a hospital in South Africa. He also instructed native nurses and hospital assistants and laid a foundation for a medical school. Stewart also made many house calls. People described Stewart as \\"the beloved physician in many a home\\" and that he \\"gave both ungrudgingly, and no home was too far [for him], no road too difficult, no night too stormy, to hinder the great missionary in his errands of mercy\\". One person described how one night Stewart was called for because a little boy had been bitten by one of the most dangerous serpents, the puff-adder. Stewart sucked the venom out of every one of the boy‚Äôs wounds, risking his own life to save the young boy. This example is very accurate depiction of how much Dr. Stewart cared for his patients. = The Hospital at Lovedale = Stewart had many goals. Stewart had sole medical charge of all the boys and girls at Lovedale, but he also wanted to create a hospital there. His first attempt did not work, however with the help of the Colonial Government he opened the Victoria hospital. He gained the respect of natives by charging a small amount for the medicine and treatment he gave them. This made them value his care more. The hospital was opened in 1898 and after a few obstacles had an annual attendance of five thousand. Stewart also wanted to create a medical college, and planned to eventually expand the hospital at Lovedale into a medical school. He wanted the people of Ethiopia to have access to a full medical education.  Later life  Stewart Hall, University of Fort Hare In 1899 he succeeded Rev Alexander Whyte as Moderator of the General Assembly, the highest position in the Free Church of Scotland.Free Church Monthly July 1899 During Stewart's later life he made many trips between Africa and Europe. He travelled to Lovedale in 1899, then came back to Scotland in 1900. He again visited Lovedale in 1901, and returned to Edinburgh in 1902. He then visited America in 1903, and went from there to Lovedale in 1904, then went to Cape Town in 1905. Looking back on his experience in Africa, Dr. Stewart realized that \\"but of all that the African continent contains which the civilized nations prize and want, it still remains true that the most valuable asset in Africa is the African himself. We cannot do without him, and, if he is wise, he will admit that he cannot do without us.\\" Stewart learned to respect the African's and realized that the natives had as much to offer to him as he has to them. Stewart died on 21 December 1905, in Lovedale. Family In 1866 James Stewart married Williamina (\\"Mina\\") Stephen. They had one son and eight daughters.

The Carolina Rifles were a semi-private military group organized in 1869 during Reconstruction when armed military units were banned.

She is the author of Beasts and Gods: How Democracy Changed its Meaning and Lost its Purpose and In Defence of Democracy.  Education  Fuller attended North Lambton Secondary School in Forest, Ontario. After finishing high school, Fuller moved to Europe at the age of 19 where she learned German at Clausthal University of Technology, Clausthal-Zellerfeld, and subsequently studied Law with a focus on Public International Law and Legal Philosophy at Georg-August- University in Goettingen, Germany. She then wrote her PhD at Trinity College in Dublin, graduating in 2010 as a Doctor in Philosophy (Law), for her thesis on Democracy and International Law.  Academia  Fuller lectured in Law at Trinity College Dublin and the National University of Ireland, Maynooth during which she compiled the second edition of Biehler on International Law: An Irish Perspective, which continued the work of her thesis supervisor the late Gernot Biehler. She also authored several academic articles on issues ranging from Terrorism to Participatory Democracy and Whistleblowing. Following the publication of Beasts and Gods, Fuller founded the Solonian Democracy Institute, which focuses on creating the conditions for direct, digital democracy. As director of the institute, Fuller is a regular speaker at events across the political spectrum, from the UK Battle of Ideas, to the Libertarian Movement, to universities around the world. The Solonian Democracy Institute organizes conferences and educational events and publishes studies related to participatory and digital democracy.  Journalism  Fuller has written extensively for publications around the world, including the LA Review of Books, The Nation, Salon, the Toronto Star, the Financial Times, Alternet and Spiked. Between 2014 and 2016, she was a columnist for RT OpEdge where she ran a legal column called ‚ÄúThe Fuller Picture‚Äù. Her writing has focused on systemic analysis on the topics of politics, democracy, whistle-blowing and education. Following an initial interview on Tonight with Vincent Brown (TV3, Ireland) on the Savita Halappanavar case in 2012, Fuller is now regularly asked to comment on matters of democracy, whistle-blowing, international law, and politics with appearances on BBC World Service, BBC Radio 4, ABC Australia, The Keiser Report, Headstuff, Worlds Apart and Redacted Tonight.  Writing & Views  = Earlier Works = Fuller wrote her first novel - ISAK  in 2005 while studying for the Bar Exam in Germany. The novel, which is set in the future, is an allegoric reflection of the issue of international terrorism, in particular questioning what precisely constitutes terrorism and which actions by governments or individuals can be subsumed under the term. In 2007, parts of the novel were adapted as a stage play performed at the Irish Writers' Centre. In 2008, Fuller co-founded the Irish Writers' Exchange, an organisation of both Irish authors and writers from around the world who have chosen to make Ireland their home away from home. The group contributes book reviews of current and classic fiction for Dublin-based multi-cultural newspaper Metro √âireann. Fuller and her book ISAK were mentioned in the 2009 edition of German travel guide Marco Polo for Dublin In 2010 Fuller edited and contributed to Dublin: Ten Journeys, One Destination, a collection of short stories published by the Irish Writers' Exchange. In October 2011, the group won a special sponsors award at the MAMA Awards in Dublin. = Beasts and Gods: Ancient & Digital Democracy = In 2015 Zed Books published Fuller's academic research into democracy as a general trade book: Beasts and Gods: How Democracy Changed its Meaning and Lost its Purpose. The book is an analysis of the origins of democracy, its modern applications and the resulting loss of \\"people power\\". The book has received endorsements from Irish Times columnist Fintan O'Toole, who called it \\"a timely and provocative look behind the clich√©s of Western politics\\" as well as professor of law Marjorie Cohn and Jillian York of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Forbes has called Beasts and Gods \\"a visionary thought experiment . . . guaranteed to make you think differently about the trillion dollar bureaucracies we call democracy today.\\" She was interviewed about the book on the Keiser Report, Artist Taxi Driver, This is Hell and The University Times. In Beast and Gods, Fuller outlines the shortcomings of modern democracy (statistical skewing, corruption, unaccountable politicians) and contrasts the design of modern western democratic systems with both the original democracy in ancient Athens and the Roman Republic, concluding that much of what we think of as democracy today, has in fact, deeply undemocratic, Roman Republican roots. Fuller traces the effects of this democratic deficit from national parliaments to international organisations such as the IMF, World Bank and the UN Security Council. Fuller then applies the principles of Athenian democracy to modern systems in order to determine how we could use modern information technology to unlock the participatory potential of direct, digital democracy.  Debate with Andrew Sullivan  In May 2016 Andrew Sullivan published an article in New York Magazine called Democracies end when they are too democratic in which he argued that democracies needed elites to \\"protect this precious democracy from its own destabilizing excesses.\\" Fuller debated Sullivan in a much-discussed polemic article Democracy ‚Äî Too Much of a Good Thing?, which was called \\"an amusing exploration of the topic\\" by Matt Taibbi and even became the topic of a class assignment at Duke University. = In Defence of Democracy & Opposition to ‚ÄúSortition-ism‚Äù = In 2019, Fuller followed up on Beasts and Gods with the publication of In Defence of Democracy, which has received endorsements from Democracy International and was positively reviewed by the Washington Post and the LA Review of Books. In Defense of Democracy first debunks the theories of academics and writers across the political spectrum who believe that voters are either too stupid, too racist or too crazy for democracy. She argues that these ideas are based on questionable empirical research, and that democracy is not about ‚Äúright‚Äù or ‚Äúwrong‚Äù outcomes, but simply a method of mediating conflict. Fuller also demonstrates that one of the commonly proposed political reforms ‚Äì randomly selecting citizens into citizen assemblies or decision-making bodies (also called sortition) ‚Äì not only misconstrues the role sortition played in the ancient Athenian democracy but ultimately enhances elite control by limiting decisions to small, externally controllable groups. Fuller expanded on this theme in her 2019 article Don‚Äôt be fooled by Citizens' Assemblies, published on Unherd. Finally, Fuller proposes a way forward, using direct, digital democracy to translate the will of the people into policy. Her approach involves five main principles: # Mass participation in the form of online voting and deliberation # Pay for Participation using a form of Universal Basic Income # Tying deliberation to actionable outcomes # Informal leadership based on the Athenian concept of rhetors # Using sortition, but limited to appointing administrative tasks and positions In an interview with Forbes, Fuller outlined some of the thought processes behind these principles: # Technology for large-scale, direct democracy is less about elections and more about empowering policy debate and decision-making en masse # Corrosive political media thrives because virtual conversations are untethered from policy consequences # Reforming democracy with technology-scaled participation requires practical citizen education # Mass engagement could rebuild fractured communities # Transformation will depend on leaders with a vision for challenge and excellence In 2020 In Defense of Democracy was selected as a finalist for the Next Generation Indie Book Awards = Education = Drawing on interviews with current and former adjunct lecturers, Fuller wrote a much- debated article on the exploitation of adjunct academics called Heartbreaking Stories from Academia: America‚Äôs Universities Treat Most Faculty Like Peons, and the Results Are Not Pretty. Originally published on Alternet in 2016, the article was subsequently re-printed by Salon and Truthdig. Fuller also criticized the modern university education systems in an article in the Irish Independent in 2013.  Election Campaign  In 2016, Fuller ran as an Independent candidate in the 2016 Irish general election. She received 775 votes. She ran on a platform of digital democracy. Following the election, Roslyn has implemented her election promise of direct people participation by conducting the first Digital Democracy experiment in Ireland, in which she asked people in her electoral area of Dublin Fingal to discuss and decide on a number of local and national policy priorities. She has stated that she intends to take action on the outcome of the initiative as part of her election promise.  Support for Whistle-blowers  In 2013 Fuller set up Wikilicious.net to raise money for organisations supporting whistle-blowers For the project she combined photos from her modelling career with information on whistle-blowers throughout recent history. The project has been widely covered in media around the world. In 2020 she favourably reviewed Edward Snowden's Permanent Record for the LA Review of Books.  Modeling  Fuller worked as a model between 2005 and 2012, especially in the areas of fine art, glamour and nude art work. She has posed for some of Ireland's best-known photographers (Vincent O‚ÄôByrne, Mike Brown - in 2012 nominated for the Black Spider Award for one of his photos of Fuller) and artists (Isobel Henihan, Sahoko Blake, the RHA). She has also worked abroad in Germany, the UK and Canada and has popularised Bodypainting in Ireland, having been chosen three times to model at the World Bodypainting Festival in Austria for special effects artist Raquel Guirro (Pan's Labyrinth). She is extremely short: only 4‚Äô10\\". Articles about her have been published in Hotpress, the Sunday World, Irish News of the World, Irish Daily Star, Irish Daily Star on Sunday among others. In 2009 she appeared on the TV show Ireland AM with bodypainter Nina Moore to publicise the World Bodypainting Festival as well as enjoyed radio coverage on RT√â's Mooney Show. From 2012 to 2014 Fuller organised the annual Irish Bodypainting Competition, which has attracted media attention in Ireland, the UK and the US.

Pere Charles was built in 1982, and at the time of her sinking, had a gross tonnage of 100 metric tons and an overall length of 20 meters. She was one of the largest and most modern fishing vessels operating from her port of Dunmore East, Waterford. Pere Charles was particularly suited for herring fishing, although she was capable of fishing for a variety of species. In January 2006, Pere Charles was purchased by a fisherman operating out of Dunmore East, and was refurbished, entering the local fleet after passing a safety inspection. Sinking On the 10th of January 2007, Pere Charles was conducting Pair Trawling with another vessel, Suzanna G While returning home in the midst of a storm, fighting heavy seas and with a full catch of herring, Pere Charles sank, with all five of her crew lost. Despite possessing modern safety and radio equipment, as well as ocean standard life-rafts, none of the five men were ever recovered. The final message from Pere Charles, sent by VHF to Suzanna G shortly after 6PM, was: \\"She has breached on me. Stand by.\\" Susanna G replied \\"Yes, Ok\\". All contact with the vessel was then lost. An investigation by Marine Casualty Investigation Board (MCIB) was conducted, which revealed that the vessel was much lower in the water than normal on the evening of the sinking, probably due to her herring load being larger than usual. This would have increased the likelihood of water swamping the vessel. However, the report also states that the vessel was not overloaded, and should have been able to make a safe return to port. According to the report, the most likely cause of the sinking was water rushing into Pere Charless deck shelter. The vessel had only limited capability to clear water from this shelter, and after being flooded, the vessel likely heeled and sank. Extensive modifications were done to the trawler between 2001 and 2006, and no assessment was made of the changes these refits had on the trawlers stability. Although no such assessment was legally required at the time, these modifications may have contributed to the sinking. The MCIB report recommended that modifications to fishing vessels be reviewed, as well as calling for improvements to safety within the fishing industry. On the 12th of January 2007, the wreck of the trawler was located. Divers from the Irish Naval Service searched the vessel, but failed to recover any bodies. In November of the same year, Pere Charles was raised and brought to Arklow by barge. The vessel was again searched, but no bodies were found.

It was a meeting point and a social launch pad for many great female authors, artists, speakers, public figures and political activists, including some early suffragettes including Emmeline Pankhurst. It was conceived by a number of the former members of another, ladies‚Äô club, the Lyceum, some of whom considered the latter \\"too bluestocking\\" and were unhappy about it selling the old clubhouse to the RAF Club and moving to the more expensive and smaller townhouse at 138 Piccadilly. Alice Williams CBE, Francis Abbott and a number of others, along with the Committee of the National Federation of Women‚Äôs Institutes (NFWI), decided to launch the Forum Club as the London meeting centre for the regional Women‚Äôs Institute (WI) groups and prominent accomplished professional women to provide mutual support and to promote their achievements. The clubhouse in Grosvenor Place was the former residence of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, Prime Minister from 1905-1908. It is a perfect example of the architectural and interior style of Sir Ernest George and Harold Peto, whose partnership was responsible for the distinctive Victorian splendour of many stately homes and mansions. During the First World War the building was seconded by the government and housed Princess Christian‚Äôs Hospital for Officers. H.H. Princess Marie Louise, granddaughter of H.M. Queen Victoria, was the Club President between 1919-1925. Her Highness oversaw the reciprocal agreements abroad, maintaining the club‚Äôs affiliation with 40 notable establishments worldwide ‚Äì from Monaco to South Africa and Australia. H.M. Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother visited the club on no less than four occasions. The Princess Royal, Lady Mountbatten, the Crown Prince of Norway, Mrs Anne de Vere Chamberlain, the wife of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and General de Gaulle were also guests of honour at the club. In 1952 the lease in Grosvenor Place expired and the club had to look for a new home which it found at 42 Belgrave Square. On 27 May 1953 the club re-opened its doors, adding an inner yard tennis court to its facilities. The membership of WI in 1948-49 was exceeding 40,000, providing a stable flow of members to the Forum Club. The club actively participated in many events organised by the W.I. and produced its own concerts, talks, exhibitions, and contests. \\"Home and Country\\", a WI members‚Äô magazine with over 100,000 subscribers, maintained great national coverage and marketed the club events and campaigns. Sadly, by 1953 generational frictions within W.I. membership became noticeable, also, between 1948 and 1956 poor health and a few unexpected deaths among the NFWI and Forum Club committees resulted in them giving up the lease in Belgrave Square which was sold to the actor David Niven. That same year the clubhouse was featured as ‚Äòhome to Mr Phileas Fogg‚Äô in the Hollywood production of \\"Around the World in 80 Days\\". In 1957 the club founder and President between 1925-1938, Miss Alice Williams CBE, died at the age of 94. There were a number of club meetings in early 1958 but the club felt \\"out-dated\\" to the younger women joining many other ‚Äòprofessional and business ladies‚Äô establishments across the country, none of which, however, provided the same unique networking and mutual support opportunities between women of different classes of society as once did the Forum Club. As well as accommodation for members (and their maids), the club contained a dining room, a lounge, a photographic darkroom, a salon which could by hired for exhibitions, a bridge room, a billiard room, a library and a hairdressing room.

As of 1 October 2019 The Silver Line joined forces with Age UK to help more of the older people who are struggling with loneliness and isolation. The Silver Line is a subsidiary of Age UK and still has its own brand, registered charity number, Board of Trustees and CEO. History The helpline was established by Dame Esther Rantzen, who founded the children's helpline ChildLine in 1986. She wrote about her loneliness following the death of her husband Desmond Wilcox in 2000, and described loneliness among the elderly as \\"a creeping enemy\\" which \\"erodes confidence\\". Dame Esther was invited to a conference addressing the isolation of elderly people held by the Campaign to End Loneliness and the Centre for Social Justice. This led to a meeting at the invitation of Paul Burstow MP, then a Minister in the Department of Health, to discuss the creation of a helpline. The CEO of The Silver Line is Sophie Andrews. The helpline is a charity registered in the UK (Registered Charity no 1147330 in England and Wales, registered in Scotland as charity number SCO44467. Company No 8000807) Objectives The helpline aims to provide the following services: * Offer information, friendship and advice * Link callers to local groups and services * Offer regular befriending calls * Protect and support those who are suffering abuse and neglect Callers may be directed to organisations such as Contact the Elderly, Samaritans, WRVS or the Townswomen's Guild. Regional pilot A 12-month pilot of the helpline service covering the North of England, the Isle of Man and Jersey was launched in November 2012. Initially the pilot was launched in Greater Manchester and the Isle of Man. However, funding from Comic Relief allowed an extension of the pilot to cover North East England and Jersey in 2013. 8,000 calls were answered during the pilot period, with the majority of callers aged between 60 and 80. The pilot was greeted positively by most of the major charities and other organisations working in the field of elderly care. However, the head of Age Concern in Jersey initially said she liked the concept, but a new UK-based charity helpline would be confusing and unnecessary for the island. In fact the Jersey experience proved valuable not only in testing out ways of reaching the hardest-to-reach older people, but also by enabling them to call the helpline, in some calls revealing situations involving loneliness and abuse. Evaluated independently by the Centre for Social Justice, during the pilot period the helpline was found to have been transformational. One caller told the evaluation, \\"When I get off the phone I feel like I belong to the human race\\". Another said she no longer felt as if she had been \\"shuffled under the carpet.\\" It was therefore launched nationally on 25 November 2013. National launch The Silver Line launched nationally on 25 November 2013. Funding of ¬£5 million was granted by the Big Lottery Fund, as part of their Dignity programme to provide services to older people who are isolated and lonely across the UK. This was intended to cover approximately half the costs of the first two years. The launch of the brand new service was widely covered in the media, especially on radio and television, throughout the day, culminating in a special feature on BBC's The One Show. This was in order to publicize the free, confidential telephone number 0800 4 70 80 90 which is now open 24/7 every day and night, including Christmas and the New Year. To mark the launch, The Silver Line commissioned ComRes to conduct a survey into loneliness. Their findings can be extrapolated to a figure of 2.5 million older people (15%) feeling lonely often or all the time. 9 out of 10 said that the most effective remedy for loneliness is a chat on the telephone. However, since 84% said it is very difficult to admit to loneliness, even to members of their family because they do not wish to become a \\"burden\\", The Silver Line offers a general service of information, friendship and advice. The biggest single problem callers talk about is loneliness. 11,000 calls were received in the first two weeks following the national launch.  Current operations  As well as running the helpline, The Silver Line has 3,000 volunteer \\"Silver Line Friends\\" who make regular friendship calls with older people. It also offers Silver Circles (facilitated group calls for people who share a common interest). The Silver Line also makes a further 1,500 ‚Äòkeeping in touch‚Äô calls every week to isolated older people. In November 2015, it launched Silver Line Connects to provide older people with more intensive support, advice, and help with connecting to local services. On 21 June 2019, the helpline received its 2.5 millionth call, reaching this figure in less than six years since its national launch. The helpline currently receives around 10,000 calls a week, two thirds of them are received at night-time and weekends, when no other helpline is available specifically for older people who may be lonely, isolated or confused, while 85% of callers each month are contacting The Silver Line for the first time. In December 2016, the charity announced that the helpline had moved into its own offices in Blackpool where staff directly employed by The Silver Line handle calls from all parts of the United Kingdom. On 17 July 2017, it was announced that the Duchess of Cornwall had become Patron of the charity. As of 1 October 2019 The Silver Line joined forces with Age UK to help more of the older people who are struggling with loneliness and isolation. The Silver Line is a subsidiary of Age UK and still has its own brand, registered charity number, Board of Trustees and CEO. Evaluation of the Silver Line In November 2016, Anglia Ruskin University published an evaluation into the work of The Silver Line. The report showed that the charity is succeeding in reaching lonely people. It found that \\"over one in three people who are supported by the friendship service (in which they are matched by a like-minded volunteer) record the highest score on a scale of loneliness called the UCLA-3 index, whereas only about one in 20 people of their age and gender typically register a score this high\\".{ References Charities for the elderly based in the United Kingdom Crisis hotlines ","title":"The Silver Line"},{"id":"41170896","text":"The Pleasant Lake train station was located in the Pleasant Lake General Store in Harwich, Massachusetts on Cape Cod.

Description The Kells Crozier was made by various craftsmen over at least two different periods between the late 9th and 11th century AD. While the core of the crozier is wooden, the crook is made of silver and the staff is covered in a copper alloy sheet which was later covered with silver mounts or knobs filled with animal interlace typical of the period. The curved crest of the crook is elaborately decorated with interlinking birds; where this meets the straight end of the crook a human head appears. This is where the crozier would have once held some holy relics. Its total length measures about 133 cm. History of the Crozier  Underneath the crest of the crook is engraved an inscription in mixed Latin and the old Irish language: \\"ordo conduilis ocius do mel finnen\\", which, roughly translated, asks supplicants to pray for C√∫duilig and Maelfinn√©n who were involved in its refurbishment. Scholars have identified these names with individuals who were connected with the important Irish monastic settlement at Kells, County Meath. However, recent research has cast doubts about this connection. The crozier was found without explanation in the cupboard of a London solicitor's office in the middle of the nineteenth century. It subsequently belonged to several owners (including Cardinal Wiseman) before being purchased by the British Museum. A copy of the Kells Crozier can be viewed in the Tourist Office in the Courthouse, Kells, Co. Meath. Reliquary Deposit A key role of the Kells Crozier was to act as a repository for holy relics for the pious faithful. Enshrining items which had once belonged to saints or church leaders, such as their bones or parts of their clothing, was an important feature of religious life in early medieval Ireland. Other reliquaries common to Ireland in this period were the bell shrines, such as St Patrick's Bell in the National Museum of Ireland National Museum of Ireland website and St Conall Cael's Bell in the British Museum.British Museum Highlights Gallery Image:Kells Crozier DSCF6977.jpgThe crest of the crook Image:Kells CrozierDSCF6981.jpgFull length of the crozier Image:Kells CrozierDSCF6979.jpgOne of the mounts or knobs See also *Bell Shrine of St. Cuile√°in References Further reading *M.

Stelling was born in Daytona Beach, Florida, and has also resided in Colorado, Washington, Massachusetts, and North Carolina. He has released five official albums: Songs of Praise and Scorn (2012), False Cities (2013), Labor Against Waste (2015), Itinerant Arias (2017) and Best of Luck (2020). He has extensively toured the United States and Europe. including performances at the Newport Folk Festival (2015, 2017). Christopher Paul Stelling has been featured on the NPR Music series Tiny Desk Concert and All Songs Considered. Songs of Praise and Scorn (2011‚Äì2012) Stelling's official debut album was self released on February 21, 2012. Songs of Praise and Scorn was recorded with friends over a 5-day period in August 2011 in a 200-year-old, actively working funeral home in Kentucky. Fifteen songs were recorded, but only 10 made the cut for the actual album. The album was met with very favorable reviews, prompting The Village Voice to say, \\"Every song on his debut album Songs of Praise and Scorn cooks with both down-home comfort and avant-garde brio, Stelling building earthy folk troubadour stories over a fluster of wild arpeggios.\\" American Songwriter noted, \\"Stelling is an artist who can leave one shaking one's head in bewilderment over how somebody can play difficult guitar parts and sing a completely disparate melody line at the same time. But he also hasn't forgotten how to just play simple chords when that's what a song calls for.\\" False Cities (2013) Stelling's second album, False Cities, was released on May 21, 2013 immediately following his first European tour. Rick Moore of Music News Nashville said of the album, \\"...he [Stelling] is among the best of the current crop of troubadours who are eking out a living by playing house concerts and driving to shows in cars held together with paper clips. His fingerpicking ability is a great asset, but he writes and sings with a drive and determination that a lot of his peers lack...Stelling is on top of his game when it comes to writing songs that will translate to the stage as he travels the country to deliver them.\\" For UK/US music Web site There Goes the Fear, Carrie Clancy wrote, \\"Despite the obvious comparisons to more mainstream folk artists, the musical range of 'False Cities', especially Stelling's powerful vocal delivery, makes a unique impression. His fire-and-brimstone lyrics are by turns concretely narrative and vaguely evocative, depending on the tone and focus of the song. As a songwriter, Stelling handles his subject matter quite deftly.\\" Chris Martins of SPIN magazine said of the album, \\"The finger-picking force sings his own quavering brand of hellfire (\\"The Waiting Swamp\\") and hope (\\"You Can Make It\\") across these 10 songs, which whip the listener back and forth like a steam-powered hayride.\\" Labor Against Waste (2015) Itinerant Arias (2017) After three albums of intimate acoustic tracks, Itinerant Arias found Christopher Paul Stelling accompanied by a full band for a first time. This sonic shift away from traditional folk accentuated Stelling‚Äôs poignant lyrics, and provided increased depth to his impassioned vocals. In a glowing review, PopMatters wrote of Itinerant Arias, ‚Äúover the course of four albums, Stelling has continued to refine that sound to his growing vision of our complex world. With Itinerant Arias he takes a bold and successful step forward as a bandleader and master chronicler of our times.‚Äù Of the album title, Stelling explained he settled on Itinerant Arias because ‚Äúthese songs have in common no single origin, or sense of place. like found objects, overheard stories, lost melodies... with no real home, but from a single voice.‚Äù Itinerant Arias was released on May 5, 2017 on Anti- records. To mark the album‚Äôs release, Christopher Paul Stelling provided a track-by- track breakdown of Itinerant Arias for NPR‚Äôs All Songs Considered. Best of Luck (2020) Christopher Paul Stelling‚Äôs fifth album, Best of Luck, was released on February 13, 2020 on Anti- records. In 2016 a musical relationship was forged between Stelling and Ben Harper when Harper invited him to open at a series of well-known venues, including the Beacon Theatre, the Ryman Auditorium, Massey Hall. ‚ÄúHe took me to all these legendary rooms. Just to see that what I could do would translate in spaces like that was revelatory,‚Äù said Stelling. Harper says he instantly recognized a kindred spirit in Stelling‚Äôs virtuosic finger picking and soulful delivery, and soon signed on to produce Best of Luck. Ben Harper recruited an all-star rhythm section for the recording sessions, including drummer Jimmy Paxson (Stevie Nicks, Dixie Chicks) and bassist Mike Valerio (Randy Newman, LA Philharmonic) to lend a versatility and finesse to Stelling‚Äôs soulful guitar playing. ‚ÄúI really believe this record is the intersection where folk and soul meet,‚Äù said Harper. Best of Luck debuted at #48 on the Americana Album Chart. Following the release of Best of Luck, Stelling embarked on an extensive tour of North America and Europe.

A view of the entrance, the source of the restaurant's nickname the Down and Under The Union Grill is located in the bottom floor of the building, and because of its location at the top of a hill, part of the floor is below ground. The main entrance leads down a short flight of stairs from Wheeling Street. This rathskeller style entrance is the source of the restaurant's local nickname, \\"The Down and Under,\\" or \\"D and U.\\" The bar room is filled with wooden booths, brick walls, and antique furnishings. Other dining rooms split off from the main dining room, and feature Victorian oak furnishings.

With its proximity to David Bradford House and Washington & Jefferson College, the Pittsburgh Post- Gazette said that \\"[l]unch or dinner at the historic Union Grill would be an appropriate way to start or end an interesting day in Washington, Pa.\\"  History  The Union's Grill's location in Washington was the home of the White Goose inn and tavern, dating to 1791. In 1806, it was sold to John Rettig who renamed it the \\"Golden Swan,\\" also called \\"the Sign of the Swan.\\" On August 15, 1808, printers William Sample and William B. Brown opened The Reporter (now Observer‚ÄìReporter) newspaper in the basement. The first edition featured an advertisement for the Golden Swan. The original building was demolished in 1846 and replaced with a 3-story brick building called the Valentine House, which was itself destroyed by a grease fire in 1899. The Siegel brothers rebuilt the building and renamed it the Siegel Hotel; it was renamed the William Henry Hotel. The current iteration, The Union Grill, was opened in 1967 by Michael Flynn, whose family still owns the restaurant. It was named in honor of the stonemasons and union workers who frequented the tavern. In 2003, Michael \\"Mickey\\" Flynn Jr., his business partner, and 8 others were charged by Pennsylvania Attorney General Mike Fisher with running an illegal gambling ring out of the restaurant. Flynn was convicted and was granted bond in 2006.

He held office as Solicitor General for Ireland and Chief Justice of Munster, and was heavily involved in the Plantation of Munster. He was noted for his deep hostility to the native Irish, which was more virulent than that of the average English colonist of the time. Little is known of his family background, his early life, or his career before 1584, when he was appointed Solicitor General for Ireland.Smyth, Constantine Joseph Chronicle of the Law Officers of Ireland Butterworths London 1839 p.174 He was, as far as is known, the first Englishman to hold the office: his appointment was at the personal request of Elizabeth I, who was dissatisfied with the quality of service given by her Irish law officers, and believed that she would be better served by Englishmen. At the same time he was appointed Chief Justice of Munster. He seems to have been a diligent enough official; he wrote to Francis Walsingham late in October of the same year describing the difficulties with prosecuting the Queen's cases in the Court of Exchequer (Ireland), and his efforts to resolve these difficulties.Smythes to Walsingham 31 October 1584 Calendar of State Papers Relating to Ireland of the reign of Elizabeth 1574-1585 Public Record Office There is an interesting glimpse of his official duties in the records of the Court of Castle Chamber, the Irish equivalent of Star Chamber, in 1586. Patrick Flatsbury and his brother Edmund, of Johnstown, County Kildare, were charged with the murder of Hugh Burn. According to the later indictment against the jury, the evidence of murder was overwhelming, yet the jury, in flagrant disregard, of the evidence acquitted both the accused. Smythes prosecuted the jurors in Castle Chamber for perjury, the reasoning being that they had broken their oath to deliver a true verdict and set a \\"dangerous example\\" to other juries. They were convicted and fined, although in consideration of their poverty the fine was a small one.Crawford, Jon G. A Star Chamber Court in Ireland- the Court of Castle Chamber 1571-1641 Four Courts Press Dublin 2005 p.460 He resigned from the office of Solicitor General in 1586, perhaps due to his increasing role in the Plantation of Munster. He was granted substantial lands in the province of Munster, where he settled 600 English tenants. He was noted for his exceptional severity towards the original Irish inhabitants: he refused to have any Irish tenants, boasted that there were no \\"mere Irish\\" within miles of his lands, and remarked that he \\"would set fire to the nest rather than that any such birds should roost in any land of his\\".Kieman, Ben Blood and Soil- Modern Genocide 1500-2000 Harrisburg 2007 p. 185 If the Irish were to remain on their lands, he thought, it could only be on condition that they accept the common law, for which he had a great reverence: he compared the bringing of common law to Ireland to Moses giving law to his people.Herron, Thomas Spenser's Irish Work-Poetry, Plantation and Reformation Prague 2007 p.55 In 1588 he sat on the judicial commission, headed by Sir Edmund Anderson, the English Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, to deal with the flood of litigation over claims to the lands forfeited by the Earl of Desmond.Bagwell, Richard Ireland under the Tudors Longmans Green London 1885 Since the commission was instructed to find in favour of the Crown wherever possible, it findings were in the great majority of case a foregone conclusion, and only one Irish-born claimant out of eighty- two was even partly successful, in that he was given permission to bring his case to court.Connolly, S.J.

Baxter portrays a gambling house owner, Hudson a card dealer turned bank president and Adams the woman who comes between them. A young Natalie Wood is also in a featured role. Although the music is generally by Frank Skinner, the film features a Henry Mancini song sung by Gene Boyd and backed by the Glenn Miller Orchestra which was uncredited to Mancini. Plot Clint Saunders is dismissed from his job as the White Palace saloon's card dealer after coming to work late. He doesn't mind, wishing to leave for Colorado and the lucrative silver mines there. Saloon owner Tacey Cromwell, in love with Clint, decides to leave with him and Clint's little brother Nugget, even though Clint doesn't wish to settle down. In their new town, Clint becomes acquainted with prosperous Judith Watrous, a senator's daughter, who offers him a job running her bank and is obviously attracted to him. Tacey does her best to make a proper home for Nugget and for a young tomboy, Seely Dowder, taking in the girl when she becomes an orphan. The haughty Judith learns of Tacey's past life, after having hired a private investigator and jealously has custody of the children taken from Tacey while Clint is out of town. A broken-hearted Tacey returns to her old saloon job, while Clint remains behind and marries Judith. As years go by, Seely grows up and encounters Tacey again. They return to Colorado, where upon discovering how Judith betrayed her, Tacey plans to open a rowdy new saloon, right across the street from the Judith/Clint home out of spite. During a quarrel, a drunken Judith throws a lantern at Clint and sets their house ablaze. ( note they live in the \\"Herman Munster\\" house and ride by the \\"Beaver Cleaver\\" house too).

Webb Sculpture Garden is a 5-acre admission-free, open-air museum and sculpture park located in Dalton, Georgia, near Chattanooga, Tennessee, and is operated by the Creative Arts Guild, the state's oldest multi-disciplinary, community arts organization. The sculpture garden is the first permanent installation of its kind in the state of Georgia The garden features almost 40 outdoor sculptures in three sections of the Guild's property‚Äîthe Magnolia Crescent, the Rosen Garden and the Founders Garden‚Äîthat provide an organic setting for the works, including mature trees, shrubs and flowers. The garden includes works by prominent artists such as Isamu Noguchi, Scott Burton, Guy Dill, Chana Orloff and Ken Macklin. The Creative Arts Guild also maintains an indoor art gallery, which hosts rotating exhibits by local, regional and national artists. The sculpture garden welcomes approximately 10,000 visitors each year and is an educational resource for regional schools.  History  The sculpture garden was launched in October 2010 after local businessperson and arts patron Robert Webb raised funds for the purchase of twelve garden scale and monumental works by U.S. and Canadian artists to complement a vintage Noguchi piece donated by George and Rhenda Spence and five works that had been gifted to the Creative Guild by artists who participated in a 2003 juried exhibition curated by John Raymond Henry Webb worked with Guild executive director Terry Tomasello to grow the garden gradually, adding new work periodically during each subsequent year to maintain public interest while cultivating a sense of a unified whole in the work. The garden now features 40 works by artists from the U.S., Canada and Europe. right  Robert Webb  Robert Webb is a native of Dalton, Georgia, and a graduate of Emory University, where he launched the school's national literary journal, Lullwater Review and received a Louis Sudler Prize in the Arts. He is a widely published writer and recipient of a 1991 Georgia Council for the Arts individual artist grant in poetry as well as an arts patron and collector of American art. Webb has been honored for his community work by Georgia Trend Magazine, which named him to their annual \\"Top 40 under 40\\" list in 2005, and by the Atlanta Falcons, which cited him as a \\"Community Quarterback\\" in 2006. Webb is an executive at Mohawk Industries, a Fortune 500 flooring manufacturer, and is a three-time chair of the Creative Arts Guild's board of directors. Webb continues to curate the garden, seeking work from artists, galleries and auction houses. The garden's logo features Webb's signature, rendered as his initials. On October 6, 2015, Webb was honored by Governor Nathan Deal of Georgia as one of the recipients of the annual Governor's Awards for the Arts and Humanities at the state capitol in Atlanta.  Key works  Webb has stated that the sculpture garden's works were selected to showcase different sculptural forms‚Äîcarving, casting, assembling and modeling‚Äîas well as to create a dialogue between the works. In each section of the garden, key monumental works serve as \\"anchors\\" to define the spaces. In the more expansive \\"Magnolia Crescent,\\" William Wareham's Duende, Ken Macklin's Simoon, Guy Dill's Spreader, Caroline Ramersdorfer's Inner View Deeper, and Kyle Van Lusk's Fallen define the space. The Founder's Garden space is defined by Don Lawler's Seedling, Robert Willms' Trojan Taurus, Verina Baxter's Mr. Wrinkle's Favorite Speedwagon and Jim Wolfe's Wm. Tell. Inner View Deeper and Seedling illustrate the art of stone carving. Both works are hand carved by the artists using traditional as well as power tools. Trojan Taurus is an example of assemblage sculpture, which in this instance involves the welding together of pieces of mild steel.  Future  The sculpture garden continues to focus on outreach to non-traditional audiences. The property, with no gates or barriers, is available to the community from dawn to dusk year round and offers Guide by Cell based narration to cell-phone users. The Guild's website now features videos of each sculpture to provide viewers with a more engaging virtual experience. Additional works will become a part of the garden in the years ahead, with a constant goal of maintaining the intimacy of the viewers' experience and successfully integrating new work into the existing collection.

These emulators mimic the input-output patterns of many cognitive operations including action, perception, and imagery. Often running in parallel, these emulators provide resultant feedback in the form of mock sensory signals of a motor command with less delay than sensors. These forward models receive efference copies of input motor commands being sent to the body and the resulting output sensory signals. Emulators are continually updating so as to give the most accurate anticipatory signal following motor inputs.  Mechanics and structure  Little is known about the overall structure of emulators. It could operate like a search glossary with a very large associative memory of input-output sequences. Under this system, the emulator receives a motor command input, finds the closest matching input from its database, and then sends the associated output in that sequence. The other model is an articulated emulator. This model requires that for each significant sensor of the human musculoskeletal system there is a group of neurons with a parallel firing frequency within the emulator. These groups of neurons would receive the same input as that being sent to their corresponding part of the musculoskeletal system. For example, when raising one‚Äôs hand signals will be sent to neurons responsible for wrist, elbow, and shoulder angles and arm angular inertia. Regardless of this structure both systems will grow and change over time. This is due to constant, fluctuating noise from the environment and the fact that the body changes over time. Growing limbs and muscles result in changes in both required input commands and the resulting output. This requires a degree of plasticity in the emulators. Emulators are thus continually updating, always receiving the resulting output from the musculoskeletal system from an inputted command and comparing it to its own output. It is likely that this is accomplished through Kalman Filter. Complete correction from the difference in outputs, however, is not applied to the emulators. Basic Concept of a Kalman Filter Noise is a constant, fluctuating variable affecting musculoskeletal sensory output. Thus, output differences are almost always greater than they actually should be. Consequently, an internal calculation is made; taking into account the relative reliability of the emulator‚Äôs output and if the situational conditions tend to result in very variable or stable sensory outputs, the correction is weighted and applied. The location of these emulators have been found to be largely dependent on the motor system they provide processing and information for.  Cognitive function  Emulators are helpful tools to the body. Sensory feedback naturally takes longer than a predetermined forward model that the brain can compute or access directly. This timing gap can be delayed further by other environmental or physical factors that often occur throughout life. Emulators allow a mock output signal that is often close to that of the real thing. It is further postulated that the emulator can be run independently thus allowing the brain see the likely outcome of a command without running it on the entire system. Furthermore, when returning sensory information has noise and\\\\or holes, the emulator can be run in parallel, making corrections and filling in gaps. = Motor control = Experiments have found that the temporal length of the motor control loop takes approximately 250-400 ms. Motor centers, however, are already making corrections to their previous motor plan about 70 ms after the onset of the movement based on peripheral information that should not have arrived yet. It is thus likely that there are motor emulators that receive and process efferent copies and then send predictive peripheral output before the actual peripheral output from sensors is received. Motor centers often have to run very quickly. Feedback delays and peripheral errors make real-time, rapid motor movement very difficult and liable to failure. Through the use of emulators motor centers can receive fast and reliable feedback in the form of a priori predictions. The later real periphery output can then be incorporated into a more accurate model. = Motor imagery = It is possible that emulators are largely responsible for motor imagery. By running motor areas offline, emulators can receive hypothetical movement commands and provide the imagined likely sensory results. Much of this may be run without conscious awareness. For instance, when walking towards an object on the ground to grab it, the brain is running offline motor plans to determine the optimal hand positioning and grip strength to pick up the object. = Visual system = Visual modal specific emulators have been experimentally shown to exist in an experiment by Ernst Mach in 1896. In his experiment, the subjects‚Äô eyes were prevented from moving and then they were exposed to a stimulus that would trigger a saccade. Most subjects reported experiencing their entire visual scene briefly being shift in the opposite direction of the stimulus. Mach thus inferred that there is a mechanism within the visual system producing an a priori estimate of future visual scenes based upon motor commands and current visual stimuli. In a similar experiment on monkeys, this particular emulator was found to exist within a group of neurons within parietal cortex. Furthermore, it was discovered that these neurons began firing before the eye even moved. They only fired, however, if the motor command would result in a visual saccade. This suggests that visual emulators are modally specific.  Applications for emulators  Emulators can be useful in a variety of industries and systems. Many factories and plants have central control systems that cannot afford to wait for certain information or updates. For example, control systems in chemical plants and reactors cannot wait for correctional signals from target systems to make alterations to chemical and material distribution and flow, thus accurate a priori predictions are made. = Robotics = Emulator-like programming has already been applied to many AI. systems. In 1988 Bartlett Mel created a robot he named Murphy. Murphy was a robot arm with three joints and whose main objective was to reach out and grasp an object while avoiding contact with several objects in the way. The robot could operate under two modes. Under the first mode, Murphy would simply move its arm around the workspace until it found a path of unobstructed movement to the intended object. After enough of these runs, Murphy learns to associate a motor command with a future visual output. This leads to its second mode of operation. Similar to an emulator, Murphy can solve the navigation problem offline. Receiving visual imagery of the workspace, Murphy can manipulate an internal visual grid with efference copies. Consequently, the robot can navigate through the obstacles and grasp the intended object in only one run. The Mars landing rovers have to utilize a similar manipulation of input. NASA has to overcome an approximately twenty-minute time delay in information exchange from Earth and the rover on Mars.

Personal life Born 9 February 1878 in Nieuwer-Amstel, the oldest son of shipwright Hartwig Nicolaas Dade and Geertje Orthmann. Dade attended the Hogere Burgerschool on the Weteringschans, and was later employed as an officer for the Koninklijke PTT Nederland. He got married on 20 April 1905 to Geertruida Willemina Robaard (1871‚Äì1931) and in 1910 had his first son, Harrie Dade. After his wife Geertruida died in 1932, he remarried to Henny van Lith. In 1940 he died in Castricum at 62 years of age. Club career As a student, Dade founded a football club called Union, along with some fellow students, in 1893.

Early life  In 1985, not satisfied with the way of clay modeling at CAA, Li went to a small metal factory in Hangzhou to find the material and welder to make several metal welding sculptures. With her sculptures, she participated in The First Teacher Exhibition in the Sculpture Department in CAA, which enlarged her vision for metal materials. Assisted by her husband Guo Lianxun, Li started to work in a bigger metal factory to produce more metal welding works. The work produced in this period brought her the chance to study in UK.

Major works  =Sense of Touch - Concave-convex series= Li's best-known works were shown in her first solo exhibition the Sense of Touch - Concave-convex in CAA Art Space, Hangzhou, China in 1993. The inspiration for the works in this exhibition is from when she got rheumatic fever a research team in the northeast part of China, which almost cost her eyesight. Li began to study braille at that time. Due to her experience, her artistic thinking began to focus on the blind people and the process and way of the perception of braille. Her artistic practice is from amplifying, deconstructing and remodeling the elements in the braille. 15 works with the common element of braille made of materials such as stone, iron, bronze, and plaster were included.

Rosetti is a New York City gangster who works for Joe Masseria (Ivo Nandi). Hot-headed and easily offended, he is the primary antagonist of season three. Fictional biography Rosetti was born in Sperlinga, a small Italian comune in Sicily. He grew up in poverty, living in a hut carved into a cave. His father was a brick layer who died when he was 50. Rosetti eventually emigrated to the United States and began working for Italian mob boss Joe Masseria. He runs brothels, speakeasies and illegal gambling dens in southern Manhattan. He lives in an apartment with his wife, two daughters and mother-in-law. Although Rosetti regularly kills people over slight insults, he does not retaliate when his wife and mother-in-law openly mock him. He is also depicted as having sadomasochistic sexual tastes; he has one of his lovers choke him with a belt while he masturbates, and has another insult him as a form of foreplay. =Season 3= Rosetti is introduced beating a mechanic to death with a tire iron for making an off-handed comment about Rosetti not knowing what 3-In-One Oil is. He travels to Atlantic City on New Year's Eve (December 31, 1922) in order to purchase a large quantity of bootlegged liquor from Nucky. In order to simplify his operations and keep the law at bay, Nucky decides to sell alcohol exclusively to Arnold Rothstein (Michael Stuhlbarg). Rosetti, anticipating a 50% price markup if he were to purchase from Rothstein, curses Nucky and leaves for New York City. He then takes over the small town of Tabor Heights and blockades Nucky's shipment heading to Rothstein in New York. Since Tabor Heights sits on the only road suitable for winter travel between Atlantic City and New York and is the last spot to fill up on gas on the way, Nucky has no way to deliver his alcohol. Nucky eventually makes a truce with Rosetti, selling him alcohol, and Rosetti leaves Tabor Heights. However, Rosetti changes his mind when he perceives Nucky's departing message, \\"buona fortuna\\", Italian for \\"good luck\\" -- as an insult. This escalates, with Rosetti choosing to burn the Sheriff of Tabor Heights alive, then ambush a convoy transporting liquor to Rothstein, killing 11 of Nucky's men (in spite of Eli scouting out the town in advance). Rothstein responds by sending Benjamin Siegel (Michael Zegen) to kill Rosetti. Although Siegel fails to kill Rosetti, he does kill four of Rosetti's men and a waitress Rosetti had been having sex with, which causes Rosetti to leave Tabor Heights and return to New York. On Easter Sunday, Rosetti's second-in- command Tonino Sandrelli (Chris Caldovino) informs him of all the territory they lost in New York City because of their long absence. After dinner, Rosetti goes to church, where he chastises God for the life he was given. He then beats up a priest and steals the church donations. Masseria is upset with Rosetti's long absence and gives the order to kill Rosetti. As Masseria's men get up, Rosetti tells Masseria that his own losses are nothing compared to all that Masseria can lose from Nucky and Rothstein partnering together. Rosetti is able to convince Masseria to spare his life and provide him with additional men to kill both Nucky and Rothstein and take over Atlantic City. Rosetti is able to start his own illegal alcohol import business and take over the rackets of Atlantic City. He makes a move to kill Nucky, Rothstein and Charlie Luciano (Vincent Piazza); on a tip from Gillian Darmody, he blows up Babette's supper club, but all three men survive. A gang war soon erupts between Nucky and Rosetti, with dozens of casualties on both sides, including Nucky's top enforcer Owen Sleater (Charlie Cox). Rosetti and his men then take up residence in Gillian's brothel, planning to eventually take it over. Rosetti's men soon come after Nucky himself, but he escapes and seeks protection from Northside leader Chalky White (Michael K. Williams). Rosetti tries to persuade White to surrender Nucky, but White denies knowing his whereabouts. White agrees to support Nucky and is able to fight back against Rosetti with Al Capone's (Stephen Graham) support. That night, Rosetti is about to have sex with Gillian, who tries to inject him with heroin so she can render him helpless and kill him. He realizes what she is doing just in time, however, and overpowers her, injecting her during the struggle. Moments later, Masseria's men head back to New York, as Nucky and Rothstein have struck a deal wherein Rothstein convinces Masseria to withdraw his support from Rosetti in exchange for taking over operation of the Overholt distillery. Men working for White's and Capone's gangs ambush and kill Masseria's men as they leave town, while Richard Harrow (Jack Huston) shows up at the brothel to rescue Gillian's grandson Tommy, and kills most of Rosetti's men in the process with the exception of Rosetti, Tonino, and two of his guards. Nucky and Eli find Tonino in the aftermath of the massacre, and agree to let him live on the condition that he kill Rosetti. He convenes with Rosetti and the other two guards at a beach, and while Rosetti is relieving himself, Tonino stabs Rosetti in the back, then again in the chest, killing him. Tonino then takes Rosetti's body back to New York City. Reception The role received critical acclaim and earned Cannavale the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2013. He was also nominated along with the rest of the cast for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series. Rosetti was named \\"Best TV Villain\\" of 2012 by IGN. Additionally, he has been ranked #12 by Rolling Stone among the \\"40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time\\".

He was the leading European two-year-old of 1979, when he was unbeaten in four races including the National Stakes, Ashford Castle Stakes and Dewhurst Stakes. His three-year-old season was a disappointment as he failed to win in four races, finishing second in his first two races and then running unplaced in the Irish 2000 Guineas and Derby. He was then retired to stud where he had little success as a sire of winners. Background Monteverdi was a small, \\"neat, quite attractive\\" chestnut horse with a small white star and white socks on his hind legs bred in Ireland by Lawrence Kip McCreery at his Orchardstown Stud in County Tipperary. He was sired by Lyphard, an American-bred, French-trained stallion who won the Prix Jacques Le Marois and Prix de la For√™t in 1972. At stud in the United States, Lyphard sired many important winner including Three Troikas, Manila and Dancing Brave. Monteverdi's dam Janina, was a half-sister of the Coronation Cup winner Nagami and a great-granddaughter of the outstanding broodmare Athasi, whose other descendants include Trigo, Tulyar and Time Charter. As a yearling, Monteverdi was offered for sale at Saratoga where he was bought for $305,000 by representatives of the British businessman Robert Sangster. The colt was returned to Ireland and was sent into training with Vincent O'Brien at Ballydoyle. Racing career =1979: two-year-old season= Monteverdi began his racing career in a six furlong maiden race at Phoenix Park in August. He started the odds-on favourite and produced an impressive performance to win from Noble Shamus. Despite his win, he was not considered the Ballydoyle stable's principal contender for the National Stakes, Ireland's most prestigious race for juveniles over seven furlongs at the Curragh in September. His stable companion, Muscovite was made 2/7 favourite, while Monteverdi, ridden by John Oxx's stable jockey Ray Carroll, started a 16/1 outsider. Monteverdi overtook the English-trained filly Millingdale Lillie two furlongs from the finish and won comfortably by two and a half lengths from Cobbler's Cove and Noble Shamus. Two weeks after his win in the National Stakes, Monteverdi reappeared in the Ashford Castle Stakes over a mile at the Curragh. Ridden again by Carroll, he started at odds of 2/5 despite conceding weight to his seven opponents. He recorded another easy win, beating March Hywel by one and a half lengths. In October, Monteverdi was sent to Newmarket in England to contest the seven furlong Dewhurst Stakes, the most important race for two-year-olds run in the United Kingdom. Ridden by Lester Piggott, he started the 15/8 favourite against a field which included Henbit, Romeo Romani (Norfolk Stakes), Marathon Gold (Lanson Champagne Stakes), Final Straw (Champagne Stakes) and Tyrnavos. Monteverdi was restrained by Piggott in the early stages before accelerating past Henbit and Tyrnavos to take the lead two furlongs from the finish. Having taken the lead, Monteverdi veered sharply to the left, and Piggott resorted to striking the horse on the head with his whip before he resumed a straight course and won by two lengths from Tyrnavos, with Romeo Romani a length and a half back in third place. At the end of the season, Monteverdi was the ante-post favourite for the following year's 2000 Guineas and Epsom Derby. =1980: three-year-old season= Monteverdi appeared to have made little physical progress and was reportedly less that fully fit when he reappeared as a three-year-old in the Group Three McCairns Trial Stakes at Phoenix Park in April, but nevertheless started the 1/3 favourite. He was restrained at the back of the field, and although he finished strongly he was beaten one and a half lengths into second place by the Paddy Prendergast-trained Nikoli. Two weeks later, the colt was sent to Newbury Racecourse in England for the Greenham Stakes, an important trial race for the 2000 Guineas. Starting the 8/13 favourite he was given a vigorous ride by Piggott, but was beaten half a length by Final Straw. After the race Monteverdi's connections were reported to be looking despondent, and the task of restoring the colt's reputation was likened by one journalist to raising the Amoco Cadiz. The form of the race actually proved to be exceptionally strong as the third and fourth-placed finishers, Posse and Known Fact went on to take second and first places in the 2000 Guineas. Monteverdi was equipped with blinkers for his next race, the Irish 2000 Guineas at the Curragh in May. He was made the 11/4 favourite but finished fifth behind Nikoli, Last Fandango, Final Straw and Posse. After the race, Piggott was heard to describe the colt as \\"useless\\" in the unsaddling enclosure. The jockey's comments were seen as aggravating the strains in the relationship between Piggott and O'Brien which saw him replaced as Ballydoyle's retained jockey by Pat Eddery in 1981. Despite his unimpressive form, Monteverdi, ridden by Piggott, started third favourite behind Nikoli and Henbit for the 201st Derby on 4 June but was never in contention at any stage and finished unplaced. Piggott stated that the colt failed to stay the one and a half mile distance, saying that he \\"didn't get the trip\\". Assessment In 1979, the independent Timeform organisation awarded Monteverdi a rating of 129, making him their top-rated two-year-old of the season. In the official International Classification he was rated the equal-best two-year-old in Europe, level with the Grand Crit√©rium winner Dragon. He was rated 123 by Timeform in 1980. Stud record Monteverdi was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at the Walmac Farm in Kentucky. He was exported to Venezuela in 1988. He was not particularly successful in either country, with the best of his offspring probably being Great Normand who won the Meadowlands Cup in 1990.

The title refers to the address of the studio in Milan, Italy, where the disc was recorded. Dalma has said he titled the disc as a nod to the Beatles' Abbey Road. The album was preceded by the single \\"Si Te Vas,\\" which was released Monday, September 30, 2013 and reached No. 21 in Spain. A music video, in which Dalma portrays the leader of a band of thieves, premiered Monday, October 21, 2013. The album also features a Catalan-language version of the song, for which Dalma wrote the lyrics.\\"Sergio Dalma: Encuentros Digitales\\" El Mundo. 12 November 2013. Upon its first week in release, Cadore 33 topped the official album chart released by Productores de M√∫sica de Espa√±a.

Clamps are absent in Lethacotyle. Ratio between clamp surface and body surface in eight families of gastrocotylinean monogeneans: the lowest ratio is in the protomicrocotylids Posterior part of a protomicrocotylid, showing bilateral asymmetry Protomicrocotylidae is a family of monogenean parasites in the order Mazocraeidea. The type-genus of the family is Protomicrocotyle. The genus was created in 1922 by Thomas Harvey Johnston and Oscar Werner Tiegs for a worm previously described under the name Acanthodiscus mirabile by MacCallum in 1918.MacCallum, G. A. 1918: Notes on the genus Telorchis and other trematodes. Zoopathologica, 1, 81-97. The worm was parasitic on a crevalle jack of the New York Aquarium. Johnston & Tiegs originally proposed to create the subfamily Protomicrocotylinae, which was later raised to family level. Members of this family are elongate, flat, and long of 1 to several millimetres. The reproductive system includes many testes, located in the anterior region of the body between the ceca, and a single posterior ovary. The male copulatory organ usually has spines. The posterior attachment organ or haptor, which attaches the worm to the host, is asymmetrical and has three pairs of small hooks. As most other polyopisthocotyleans, members of the family Protomicrocotylidae have posterior clamps on their haptor. These clamps are of the gastrocotylid type, i.e. they include two accessory sclerites in addition to the other sclerites, but in some genera the clamps are simplified as microcotylid type, i.e. they have only five sclerites, and are even absent in members of the genus Lethacotyle. Justine et al. observed that protomicrocotylids had specialized structures associated with their attachment organ, such as lateral flaps and transverse striations, which were not known in other monogeneans. They hypothesized that the clamps in protomicrocotylids were sequentially lost during evolution, coinciding with the development of other attachment structures. To test the hypothesis, they calculated the surfaces of clamps and body in 120 species of gastrocotylinean monogeneans. The ratio of clamp surface: body surface was the lowest in protomicrocotylids. They concluded that clamps in protomicrocotylids were vestigial organs, and that occurrence of gastrocotylid and simpler microcotylid clamps within the same family were steps in an evolutionary sequence, leading to the absence of these attributes in species of Lethacotyle. Protomicrocotylids are all parasitic on gills of teleost fish, of only two families, the Carangidae (jacks) and Sphyraenidae (barracudas). MacCallum (1918) found many worms on the gills of a crevalle jack and noted that he had \\"no doubt that at times the species may be a serious menace to the life of the fish\\".

The book analyzes the War in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent) in terms of Carl von Clausewitz's theory of war, arguing that modern counter- insurgencies have more in common with domestic political struggles than the traditional state-on-state conflicts described by Clausewitz. The book was favorably reviewed by Michael Howard, a prominent military historian, among others. Background Much of War from the Ground Up is an analysis of the 2001‚Äìpresent War in Afghanistan, based on the author's personal experience. Simpson studied history at Jesus College, Oxford under Niall Ferguson before attending the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and receiving his commission as an officer in the Royal Gurkha Rifles. Simpson deployed to Afghanistan three times, retiring from the Army in 2012. Content War from the Ground Up covers a wide range of topics, including grand strategy, civil-military relations, and counter-insurgency. Simpson's primary thesis is that the traditional model of war as a bi-polar conflict between two discrete political units is not helpful on the modern battlefield. Whereas in the past wars were fought to achieve a specifically military end state, soldiers today \\"directly seek political, as opposed to military, outcomes.\\" At the same time, military leaders must consider the impact of their actions not only on the enemy but on a diverse set of \\"audiences\\". Much of the material consists of historical analysis, including a chapter devoted to the Borneo Confrontation of 1962-1966. Elsewhere, Simpson critiques Samuel P. Huntington's 1957 book The Soldier and the State. Whereas Huntington had advocated strict civilian control of the military, Simpson argues for reciprocal dialogue between civilian leaders and the military. Simpson also draws on Aristotle's Rhetoric to emphasize the importance of \\"strategic narrative,\\" which he defines as \\"a story\\" used \\"to explain one's actions.\\" Reception War from the Ground Up received generally positive reviews. Military historian Michael Howard compared the work to The Face of Battle by John Keegan and even On War by Carl von Clausewitz, saying that it \\"should be compulsory reading at every level in the military.\\" Journalist Thomas Ricks reviewed the book as well, praising its writing style and its exploration of strategic narrative. Paul Raymond Newton, writing for the RUSI Journal, described the book as \\"impressive\\" but noted that it incorporated some strawman arguments, while in Parameters Richard Swain found the work to contain a \\"great wealth of thought\\" but also some structural deficiencies. Writing on the book in Foreign Affairs, Lawrence Freedman called it \\"an erudite and intelligent contribution to the literature on counterinsurgency.\\" References 2012 non-fiction books Counter-insurgency Military strategy books War in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent) books ","title":"War from the Ground Up"},{"id":"41171618","text":"Veaceslav Lisa (born 24 May 1993) is a Moldovan football midfielder who plays for FC Spicul Chi»ôcƒÉreni.

FIESP has 52 representative units in the state of S√£o Paulo, representing 133 employer's trade unions and 130,000 industries. The federation is located in the city of S√£o Paulo. The S√£o Paulo industry building is the location of the Center of Industries of the State of S√£o Paulo (CIESP), the Social Service of the Industry of S√£o Paulo (SESI-SP), the National Service for Industrial Training of S√£o Paulo (SENAI- SP), the Roberto Simonsen Institute (IRS) and the headquarters of several affiliated unions. Skaf was elected president of the Federation of Industries of the State of S√£o Paulo (FIESP) in 2004. He was re-elected in 2007 and then again in 2011. In June 2014, the entrepreneur Benjamin Steinbruch, CEO of the National Steel Company (CSN) and Vicunha Group became president of FIESP, replacing Skaf, who is running for the state of S√£o Paulo government.  History  During the 1924 Revolution led by general Isidoro Dias Lopes, the president of the S√£o Paulo Commercial Association (ACSP), Jos√© Carlos de Macedo Soares remained in S√£o Paulo, which was being bombarded to protect the working-class neighborhoods, factories and shops. When the resistance was defeated, Macedo Soares was accused of cooperating with the revolution and was exiled. As a result, the ACSP became weaker without its president. In 1928, a group of business owners from the S√£o Paulo Trade Association led by Jorge Street, Francisco Matarazzo and Roberto Simonsen founded the Center of Industries of the State of S√£o Paulo (CIESP), a private association that supports and represents industries interests. In 1931, Matarazzo, Simonsen, Street and a group of business owners founded the Federation of Industries of the State of S√£o Paulo (FIESP) to claim back the industries‚Äô competitiveness in Brazil and to reduce production costs and contain the deindustrialization. During the government of Vargas, CIESP and FIESP remained separate. After World War II, both entities returned to work together. Acting FIESP has 52 representative units in the state of S√£o Paulo. The federation comprises 133 business associations and 130,000 industries, uniting sectors that make up 42% of Brazil's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Skaf was elected president of the Federation of Industries of the State of S√£o Paulo (FIESP), the Industry Social Service (SESI-SP), the National Service for Industrial Training (SENAI- SP) and the Roberto Simonsen Institute (IRS) in 2004. He was re-elected in 2007 and again in 2011. FIESP has several committees, departments and councils representing different industrial sectors. Among the committees, there exists the FIESP's Young Entrepreneurs Committee (CJE), which is a group of young entrepreneurs who participate in several federation activities, keeping up with meetings of the high councils, departments and other committees. The CJE interacts with several entities to promote entrepreneurship. FIESP's Cultural Action Committee (Comcultura) is a group that promotes cultural activities, access to art and culture in the community (Divers√£o Terra). The Social Responsibility Committee of FIESP (Cores) is a group of professionals from several sectors to guide trade unions and industries in social responsibility management, environment and human rights. FIESP's Chamber of Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration of S√£o Paulo is engaged in administration, conciliation and arbitration mediation of business conflicts in order to decrease the number of open cases in the courts of Brazil. Recent campaigns FIESP led the campaign for approval of the General Law of Micro and Small Enterprises and the free movement of Goods and Services on wheat flour derivatives in 2006, which led to a price reduction of items like bread and pasta in 2006. In October 2007, FIESP sent a letter to Brazilian business owners that listed the reasons why the Provisional Contribution on the Movement or Transmission of Values, Credits and Financial Nature CPMF should be extinguished. FIESP sent more than 1.3 million signatures against the CPMF to the Constitution and Justice Committee (CCJ) of the Federal Senate of Brazil. In December of that year, the federal senator designated the end of CPMF's taxes. Since 2008, the FIESP claimed a tax exemption on basic food products. In 2013, the federal government approved a provisional measure that reduced the Social Integration Program (PIS), Contribution to Social Security Financing (COFINS) and eliminated the industrialized products taxes on basic food products (IPI). FIESP has also campaigned for public banks to reduce, by 30%, the rate of banking spread in 2009. In 2011, FIESP initiated the campaign 'Energy at the right price', and presented in the Audit of the Union Court requesting the government to take action regarding the country's electricity prices. The federal government then granted all Brazilians the average discount of 20% in electricity costs in 2013. In April 2013, the FIESP campaigned in the Chamber of Deputies for the approval of the Provisory Measure (MP) 595, known as the Port Law, which improves infrastructure and privatizes ports in Brazil. The Port Law was sanctioned by President Dilma Rousseff in June of that same year. In November of that year, FIESP also filed an unconstitutionality lawsuit against the law that approved an increase in the Urban Land and Building Tax (IPTU), with an average of 55% for households and 88% for businesses in the city of S√£o Paulo. The Special Institution of the S√£o Paulo Court of Justice suspended the property tax increase in December of that year. In June 2014, FIESP completed a partnership with the Center for Information and Coordination of Dot BR (NIC.br) and developed a software for fixed broadband monitoring. This free software confirms if internet connections comply with the contracted services. Cultural Center FIESP Ruth Cardoso FIESP finances and culturally supports the Cultural Center FIESP Ruth Cardoso. The FIESP Cultural Center was founded in March 1998 and named after the anthropologist Ruth Cardoso. The space includes the SESI Theatre, the SESI-SP Art Gallery and the Mezanino Area. The Cultural Center presents theatrical performances, exhibitions, concerts, film screenings and lectures. FIESP sponsored the musical The Drunk Godmother, directed by Miguel Falabella in 2013 and 2014. Location The FIESP's building headquarters is one of the city's major architectural landmarks and one of the main attractions on Paulista Avenue due to its pyramid shape. The building is 99 feet high and is one of the largest buildings on the Avenue. The building was built by Rino Levi's architectural firm in 1979. In 1998, the building was redesigned by the architect Paulo Mendes da Rocha to include the construction of a cultural center on the ground floor. *Industrial Social Services *SENAI References External links * Official website of Federa√ß√£o das Ind√∫strias do Estado de S√£o Paulo Industry in Brazil Labor in Brazil Trade unions in Brazil Culture in S√£o Paulo ","title":"Federa√ß√£o das Ind√∫strias do Estado de S√£o Paulo"},{"id":"41171716","text":"Preferential motor reinnervation (PMR) refers to the tendency of a regenerating axon in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) to reinnervate a motor pathway as opposed to a somatosensory pathway.Brushart, M. E. (1993). Motor Axons Preferentially Reinnervate, 13(June), 2730‚Äì2738. PMR affects how nerves regenerate and reinnervate within the PNS after surgical procedures or traumatic injuries. It is important to understand in order to further develop axonal regrowth surgical techniques. Further research of preferential motor reinnervation will lead to a better understanding of peripheral nervous system function in the human body regarding cell roles and abilities.  Summary  = Motor vs sensory nerve reinnervation = Nervous System Organization - The Motor and Sensory Systems The peripheral nervous system has the ability to regrow cut nerves. Motor axons preferentially reinnervate motor pathways. The tendency of motor axons to reinnervate motor pathways instead of cutaneous pathways is influenced by a number of factors in the PNS system. Some factors include Schwann cell characteristics, neurotrophic factors, and nerve branch size. These factors influence the pathway preference of the motor neuron. The different nervous systems are illustrated in the image displayed on the right. Preferential motor reinnervation is a tendency that is specifically seen in the peripheral nervous system, which is illustrated in the photos of the bottom of the system shown. = Regeneration vs reinnervation = When peripheral axons are severed, the distal part of the cut axon degenerates. The only remaining distal parts from the original nerve are the Schwann cells which myelinate the peripheral axons. The basal lamina components that the Schwann cells secrete help to guide axon regeneration. The more precisely the axon stump is able to regrow along its original path, the better the recovery of function - especially when it comes to experiencing fine touch and movements. The growth of the axon stump to its original target is regeneration.Purves, Dale, George Augustine, et al. \\"Repair and Regeneration in the Nervous System.\\" Neuroscience. Pages 563-567. Sunderland, MA Reinnervation on the other hand, is the recovery of function through reestablishing synaptic connections. Even though the original axon degenerates, the Schwann cells and acetylcholine receptors remain in place, allowing for the junction to reestablish the original synapses once the axon stump regenerates.Purves, Dale, George Augustine, et al. \\"Repair and Regeneration in the Nervous System.\\" Neuroscience. Pages 567-569. Sunderland, MA In medical jargon, regeneration and reinnervation are not commonly distinguished. Regardless of the fact that there is a technical difference, many professionals use the terms interchangeably. This is because without regeneration, there would not be a nerve to innervate, but without reinnervation, the nerve would not function. = PMR relevancy = Knowledge of preferential motor reinnervation is necessary because of how it affects the regeneration of nerves. When a patient loses nerve function, PMR can interfere with (or help) the different methods of repair that physicians use. Physicians understanding of natural nerve repair processes will allow for overall improvement in surgery, because they will be able to better interface their repair efforts with natural ones. Axon reinnervation is much affected by which pathway the regenerated nerve has chosen to grow along. The nerves' ability to properly function after damage is very dependent on successful reinnervation, which is why the effects of PMR is so relevant. The success of nerve reinnervation after different grafting attempts is a current research area. Grafting aims to solve the problem of incorrect targeting of regenerating axons, resulting in less-than-perfect reinnervation. PMR affects are being investigated to see how they can help grafting, and ultimately patient recovery.  How do nerves regrow?  = A cut nerve regenerating = A cut axon in the peripheral nervous system has two parts: a distal and a proximal axon stump. The space in between the two stumps is known as the gap, and is what the nerve must grow through in order to fully regenerate and reinnervate. The distal axon is degenerated through the body's own mechanisms, mostly macrophage consumption and enzymes breaking it down. The proximal part of the cut axon is many times able to regenerate. The regeneration and reinnervation of the cut nerve is affected by multiple factors, including how far the nerve must regrow, what kind of environment it is growing in, and the different Schwann cells and pathway options available. PMR indicates that a regenerating motor neuron will choose a motor pathway Schwann cell over a cutaneous pathway Schwann cell when regenerating. = The role of Schwann cells = Cultured Schwann cell Schwann cells are the myelination cells that surround nerves. When multiple nerves are cut, they must regrow and enter back through one of the Schwann cells that makes up the distal stump of the gap. These Schwann cells support axonal regrowth through their production of trophic factors as well as surface expression of multiple cell adhesion molecules that help influence axonal growth. = Neurotrophic support = Neurotrophic factors are support proteins and factors that help assist in the growth and maintenance of axons throughout the body. Different cells emanate different proteins, but the ones specific to the peripheral nervous system play a major role in regeneration of cut nerves in the peripheral nervous system. In relation to reinnervation, neurotrophic support is key in assisting with supporting the regeneration of axons. Some discussion has led investigators to believe that neurotrophic factors only led to more axonal sprouting rather than actually influencing the regeneration. The ability of neurotrophic factors to influence the sprouting of axons has been seen with electron microscopic images and in multiple studies extensively detailed in a review of the role of neurotrophic factors in regeneration. In addition to the ability of the factors to influence sprouting, Schwann cells in particular show a significant upregulation of a number of trophic factors after undergoing axotomy. One major difference in motor and sensory pathways is the difference in what trophic factors are upregulated by the Schwann cells of those pathways. Denervenated motor Schwann cells upregulate BDNF and p75, whereas sensory pathway Schwann cells upregulate a number of other varied trophic factors. This difference in trophic factor support is suspected to be a major influencer of preferential motor reinnervation. Though it is a major factor, inherent molecular differences do not alone determine the reinnervation pathway of the motor neurons, as demonstrated in a study done in a mouse femoral nerve, where the size of the pathways were manipulated, leading to incorrect motor axon pathway reinnervation.  PMR influencing factors  = End organ contact = End-organ contact can also have a major effect on the reinnervation accuracy of the axon. The first two weeks following the damage, it is statistically insignificant, because end-plate reinnervation is just starting. However, after that time period, end-organ contact plays a role in influencing the reinnervation ability of the axon. When the end of the pathway is a muscle contact area, there is a significant difference in the number of motor neurons reinnervating. = Cellular & molecular mechanisms = These are trophic factors that are discussed in detail in above sections. These factors can influence where an axon grows towards, mostly from chemotaxis effects that the different proteins have on the growing axon's directionality. The trophic factors differ between motor and sensory pathways, which is a major influential factor in preferential motor reinnervation. = Terminal nerve branch size = The terminal nerve branch size has a lot of influence on the reinnervation pathway of the axon. When two pathways, one cutaneous and one motor, are roughly comparable in size, the motor axons follow preferential reinnervation patterns along the motor pathways. However, enlargement of sensory pathways in the same experiment led to the motor axons to reinnervate those pathways, indicating that trophic factors alone do not cause reinnervation of motor neurons. This is shown because the motoneurons wrongly reinnervate down pathways that are sensory, thus demonstrating that the size of the terminal nerve branch pathway can affect the axonal reinnervation patterns. = Reinnervation accuracy = The ability of an axon to \\"choose\\" the accurate Schwann cell and eventually site of innervation is interconnected to preferential motor reinnervation. The specificity of a motor axon to preferentially choose the motor pathway is the very essence of preferential motor reinnervation. Additionally, it influences whether or not a nerve can truly experience full reinnervation and recovery of function that is likened to what it had before the injury. Thus, this accuracy influences whether or not a motor axon preferentially reinnervates. Different studies are investigating how an axon pathway specificity can be manipulated in order to see what kind of surgical advances can be made regarding neuron repair.  PMR use in medicine  The varied accuracy of damaged axons regenerating and reaching their original target end is a large reason that functional recovery of damaged nerves is such a variable in the peripheral nervous system. The understanding of what Schwann Cell tube axons tend to reinnervate has implications for whether a nerve will be able to become functional again after damage. If the axon is a subcutaneous axon and ends up in a motor Schwann Cell tube, it will not be able to innervate the muscle it ends up connected to. Thus, understanding how axons do reinnervate, and how motor axons can be pushed towards the correct regeneration site is an area of study that is extremely beneficial in helping to advance nerve repair in the PNS system. In 2004, a study looked at how Lewis rats' sensory vs motor nerve grafts affected the regeneration of a cut mixed nerve system (both motor and sensory nerves). It was noted that after 3 weeks, a mixed nerve defect had undergone substantial regeneration when paired with a motor nerve graft or a mixed nerve graft. In comparison, a sensory nerve graft was statistically less affective in regeneration, looking specifically at nerve fiber count, percent nerve, and nerve densities as the main three comparisons between the different grafts. This means that the best surgical practices in regenerating nerves regarding PMR is using a nerve graft that is either a motor or a combination nerve graft. In a study published in 2009, the terminal nerve branch size was investigated to see how it affected nerve regeneration. It was discovered that the branches of similar size initially regenerated about equally between cutaneous and muscular pathways, but after a while favored muscle branch paths. The study end results predicted that axonal collateral formation at the injured site being increased could increase regeneration accuracy. Understanding PMR affects would help overall in gaining a better understanding of the forces that influence the neuron repair, which was the overall conclusion of what was needed to help nerves functionally repair. This increasing understanding will overall impact surgical and repair processes with peripheral nerve repair. Though manipulation of axonal collateral formation may help, the further understanding of PMR will allow for the surgical practices and medical advances in nerve repair to continue developing.

Initially it employed Pratt brick presses, and constructed Hoffman patent continuous firing kilns, developed by Friedreich Hoffman in Stettin, Prussia in 1859. In 1887 the company had ordered Bradley & Craven Ltd automatic brick presses, which were fabricated by Langlands foundry and a year later purchased another at the centennial exhibition. The first kiln was circular, but the company rapidly expanded and added at least five oblong Hoffman Kilns between 1880 and about 1914.lan Stuart, A History of the Victorian Brick Industry: 1826-1920 In 1884 the company erected the new No 2 works in Dawson Street Brunswick, south of the original works, as the clay pit had been exhausted, having excavated up to the backs of nearby houses.Iain Stuart, Why Did the Hoffman Brick and Pottery Works Stop Making Bricks?

After the depression of the 1890s, the company expanded throughout the following decades. The Hoffmans factory whistle, which rang from 7:15 to 7:20 in the morning, to wake workers, was so regular that locals could set their watches by it. The company also added a pottery works, much of the production going to terracotta sewage pipes as the Melbourne Sewage Scheme was being construction around the turn of the century. The pottery also manufactured a wide range of domestic wares including the Mel-rose Australian WareThe Potteries of Brunswick by Gregory Hill () Former Hoffman Brickworks The Hoffman No 1 was used as a rubbish tip from 1947, taking 17 years to be filled completely. By 1981, it had settled sufficiently to be redeveloped by the local Council as a park, named the M.W. Clifton Reserve. The Brunswick works was instrumental both in introducing new technology into the Australian brick industry, but also in restructuring the commercial basis, leading the move to takeovers and mergers and the creation of a brick cartel or combine, to set the price and production quotas for many competing brick companies. In 1960 the Brunswick brickworks was taken over by Clifton Holdings, another brickmaker from St Georges Road Preston, which downsized operations and sold off assets at Brunswick and other brickworks, before it was itself taken over with Nubrick to form the Austral Brick Company. The works operated up to the late 1990s, but was sold to a developer on the basis that part of the site would be preserved and restored.

The film tells the story of a bug exterminator, who, with the help of a hospital security guard and the military, battles a giant spider that goes on a rampage in Los Angeles. Plot Alex Mathis (Greg Grunberg) is a cash- strapped but good-natured exterminator working in Los Angeles. While helping an elderly woman with a rodent problem, he is bitten by a venomous spider and is treated at a hospital. Meanwhile, a mortician is bitten by a rodent-sized spider that crawls out of a dead body which just arrived at the hospital. Learning of this, Alex offers to take care of the spider in exchange for clearing his hospital bill. Jos√© Ramos (Lombardo Boyar), a hospital security guard, offers to help Alex. Going to the morgue, Alex deduces the spider escaped into an air vent. He enters the vent and communicates with Jos√© via walkie-talkie. Meanwhile, a military task force led by Major Braxton Tanner (Ray Wise) and Lieutenant Karly Brant (Clare Kramer) show up at the hospital to examine the dead body the spider burst out of. Meanwhile, the spider, growing exponentially, kills a paralyzed hospital patient. Back inside the vent, Alex stumbles upon a spiderweb and learns that it is highly flammable. Alex ventures into the hospital basement, where he has a confrontation with the spider. The spider is driven off by Karly and escapes into a grate down into the sewer, where it kills a homeless man. Alex, enamored with Karly, offers his assistance to Braxton, who declines, especially when Alex presses her for answers on where the spider came from. Jos√© convinces Alex to continue their pursuit as it could be the most important thing of their lives. The duo tracks the still-growing spider at a public park, where it kills dozens of people. Alex and Jos√© get the spider to chase their truck and lure it to the military. A huge firefight ensues, but the spider escapes into the nearby woods. Karly and a group of soldiers pursue it, but the spider ambushes them, kills most of the soldiers, and captures Karly. After Alex and Jos√© demand answers, Braxton reveals that they discovered alien DNA and hoped to use it as a growth hormone. However, a spider's nest was hidden in some test fruit, thus exposing the spider to the alien DNA and triggering its rapid growth. It is also revealed that the spider will soon start reproducing based on its size and their studies of the alien DNA. Alex and Jos√© head for the city, as the now-enormous spider sets up a nest at the U.S. Bank Tower. As they enter the skyscraper, Braxton informs them that Karly is located directly inside the nest, and warns them of an impending airstrike. They get to Karly and free her and several other trapped citizens just before the hatching baby spiders can attack. The group makes it out of the building seconds before the airstrike hits, provoking the spider. Alex deduces from the spiderwebs' flammability that the spider could be killed by shooting its spinneret. Jos√© grabs a rocket launcher from a military vehicle and tosses it to Alex, who shoots the spider in the spinneret. The spider explodes, finally killing it. Alex embraces Karly, and the two enjoy a passionate kiss. In a mid-credits scene, Braxton calls Alex to tell him they have another problem. In the background, a giant cockroach can be seen climbing the Statue of Liberty in a video monitor.

Mathis as Street Cop Production Big Ass Spider! was directed by Mike Mendez. It stars Lin Shaye, Ray Wise, Patrick Bauchau and Clare Kramer. To cast extras for the film, Mendez used people from his Facebook friends list, as he did not have enough money for paid extras. The film's screenplay was originally called Dino Spider. Distributors pushed for the film to be retitled Mega Spider, as they felt that Big Ass Spider! would not be marketable. However, Mendez convinced the distributors to keep the title, feeling that Big Ass Spider! \\"is the right title for the movie. I felt it in my heart and soul.\\" Reception The film has received positive reviews, holding a 78% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Scott Foundas of Variety gave a positive review, calling the film \\"an exceedingly good-natured Z-grade creature feature.\\" He went on to write that \\"Many worse ways to spend 80 minutes can easily be imagined.\\" Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic opined that the film was \\"gleefully schlocky\\" but criticized the film for being predictable. John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter wrote positively of the film, saying \\"Mike Mendez's shamelessly Corman-esque Big Ass Spider! does almost everything just a tiny bit better than it needs to.\\" Adversely, Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times gave a negative review of the film, branding it as a \\"humorless horror comedy\\". He concluded by saying that \\"the director, Mike Mendez, shows no signs of knowing how to make campy horror work the way that the creators of similar movies on Syfy do. It has to be either subtle or over the top. This is neither.\\" Rex Reed rated the film a 1 out of 4, saying that it was \\"lazily directed\\" and \\"aims for satire and settles for stale shtick\\". The film has a metascore score of 53 on Metacritic.https://www.metacritic.com/movie/big-ass- spider!

The descendant of a prominent Arab family, he was the brother of Khalid al-Qasri, the powerful governor of Iraq for most of Hisham's reign. Asad's first tenure as governor in 724‚Äì727 came in the wake of the \\"Day of Thirst\\", a severe defeat at the hands of the T√ºrgesh Turks in Transoxiana. Asad tried to reconcile the local Soghdians to Muslim rule, initiated tax reforms to address the grievances of the native converts to Islam (mawali), and enjoyed good relations with many local nobles, who began to convert to Islam under his influence. His military expeditions during his first tenure were targeted mainly against restive local princes, avoiding a direct confrontation with the T√ºrgesh. After his dismissal, his successors reversed his policy of reconciliation, resulting in a large-scale anti-Arab rebellion among the Soghdians. Another major defeat against the T√ºrgesh in the Battle of the Defile was followed by the almost complete collapse of the Arab position in Trasoxiana and the outbreak of a major rebellion in Khurasan itself, led by al-Harith ibn Surayj. Appointed for a second time to govern Khurasan in late 734, Asad brought fresh troops into the province and managed to suppress Harith's uprising in 735‚Äì736, although the rebel leader himself escaped capture. An expedition in Khuttal in 737 brought about the intervention of the T√ºrgesh khagan at the head of an army. Despite initial Arab setbacks and the T√ºrgesh invasion of Khurasan, Asad succeeded in inflicting a defeat upon the khagan in person at the Battle of Kharistan, turning back the T√ºrgesh army. Despite Asad's death a few months later, this success was instrumental in preserving Muslim rule in Central Asia, as the blow to the khagans prestige led to his murder soon after and the collapse of T√ºrgesh power. At the same time, Asad's conciliatory policy towards the native population laid the foundations for its eventual acceptance of Muslim rule and the Islamization of Central Asia.  Origin Asad was a member of the Qasr clan, a subtribe of the Bajila. His great-grandfather, Asad ibn Kurz al-Qasri, is said by some traditions to have been the chief of the Bajila in the times of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and is counted as one of Muhammad's companions. Other traditions, hostile to the family, report that Asad was a Jew and a runaway slave. Asad's grandfather Yazid was an early and prominent supporter of the Umayyads in the First Fitna, while Asad's father Abdallah sided with Ibn al- Zubayr in the Second Fitna, but was eventually pardoned by the Caliph Abd al- Malik ().  First governorship of Khurasan  Map of Khurasan and Transoxiana in the 8th century In 724, immediately after Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik () ascended the throne, Asad's brother Khalid al-Qasri was appointed to the important post of governor of Iraq, with responsibility over the entire Islamic East, which he held until 738. Khalid in turn named Asad as governor of Khurasan. The two brothers thus became, according to the historian Patricia Crone, \\"among the most prominent men of the Marwanid period\\" of the Umayyad Caliphate. Asad's arrival in Khurasan found the province in peril: his predecessor, Muslim ibn Sa'id al-Kilabi, had just attempted a campaign against Ferghana and suffered a major defeat, the so-called \\"Day of Thirst\\", at the hands of the T√ºrgesh Turks and the Soghdian principalities of Transoxiana that had risen up against Muslim rule. According to the historian H.A.R. Gibb, this Muslim defeat \\"marks a period in the history of the Arab conquests. It was practically the last aggressive expedition of the Arabs into Transoxiana for fifteen years, but of much greater importance was the blow which it struck at Arab prestige. The roles were reversed; from now onwards the Arabs found themselves on the defensive and were gradually ousted from almost every district across the Oxus.\\" In this situation, Asad followed a policy of consolidation and limited military activity, focusing on enforcing Muslim control in the minor local potentates and avoiding a direct confrontation with the Muslims' main enemy, the T√ºrgesh. Thus in 107 AH (725 or 726 AD) Asad campaigned against Namrun, King of al-Gharshistan (northeast of Herat), whom he forced to submit and convert to Islam, before going on to subdue the region of Ghur (central Afghanistan). The next year, Asad campaigned in Khuttal in Tokharistan, where he was confronted by the khagan, who was called upon for aid by the local ruler, al-Sabal. One tradition holds that Asad retreated over the Oxus and went on to campaign with success in Ghur in the next year, but according to another he suffered a heavy defeat by the T√ºrgesh. In either case, Asad's military ventures were only moderately successful, and most importantly failed to address the growing danger of the T√ºrgesh, who with the support of the local princes threatened to expel the Arabs back beyond the Oxus. At the same time, Asad tried to conciliate the local population, hoping to prevent them from supporting the T√ºrgesh. He continued his predecessor's policy of appointing men known for their honesty as his fiscal agents. His reforms aimed to stop discrimination against the mawali, the native converts to Islam, by ceasing the collection of the jizya from them. This measure was vehemently opposed by the Arab settlers of Khurasan, but according to Khalid Yahya Blankinship \\"it may have helped to discourage the Turks for a couple of years by keeping the Transoxianans on the Muslims' side\\". Despite Asad's efforts and his good relations with the local Iranian land-owning class, the dihqans, taxation remained a heavy burden for the subject populations, and the greed and cruelty of Arab and Iranian tax collectors alike meant that Khurasan became a fertile field for the Shi'ite and Abbasid missionaries (da'wa). Among the local nobility, Saman Khuda, the ancestor of the Samanid dynasty, is said to have been converted to Islam by Asad at this time, and Saman's eldest son was named Asad in the governor's honour. Silver dirham minted in Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik's name at the mint of Balkh, 108 AH (726 or 727 AD) In 726 Asad rebuilt the city of Balkh, which had been destroyed by Qutayba ibn Muslim following a revolt, and transferred there the Arab garrison troops from nearby Barukhan. Asad also resumed, after almost a decade, the practice of sending envoys to the Chinese court. This move was clearly linked to the T√ºrgesh threat, as the Turks were Chinese vassals and were regarded by the Transoxianians as the agents of the Chinese emperor, sent to deliver them from Arab rule. Asad is also said to have built the village of Asadabad near Nishapur, which his descendants held until Tahirid times. Asad was dismissed from his office in Ramadan 109 AH (December 727 or January 728 AD), when in an outburst of anger he had the chief representatives of the four greatest Arab tribes in Khurasan, the Ahl al-Aliyah, Azd, Tamim, and Bakr, publicly flogged. Caliph Hisham demanded his dismissal, and after naming al-Hakam ibn Awana al- Kalbi as his deputy, Asad returned to his brother in Iraq.  Second governorship of Khurasan  Asad was replaced by Ashras ibn Abdallah al-Sulami (727‚Äì730). The new governor at first continued Asad's policy of conciliation, but then reversed it, leading to the outbreak of a full-scale rebellion in Transoxiana, which, coupled with renewed T√ºrgesh attacks, reduced the Arab presence there to Samarkand and its environs. Ashras was able to recover Bukhara, but his successor, Junayd ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Murri, presided over the disaster of the Battle of the Defile, which crippled the Khurasani army, in 731. By the time of Junayd's death in 734, the Muslim holdings in Transoxiana had been reduced to Bukhara and parts of Tokharistan. These military defeats, the long-held grievances against the Umayyad government, and the forcible requisition of food by Junayd during the famine of 733 led to the outbreak of a rebellion in early 734, led by al-Harith ibn Surayj. Harith's uprising involved both Arabs and native princes, especially from the hitherto loyal principalities of Tokharistan, and spread quickly, with the rebels capturing Balkh. The new governor, Asim ibn Abdallah al-Hilali, managed to check Harith's advance on the capital, Marw, and forced him to seek terms. Asim's position remained precarious, however, and he wrote to the Caliph, asking for the placement of Khurasan once again under the purview of Iraq, the appointment of a new governor and the substantial reinforcement of the province with Syrian troops. Hisham accepted the recommendations, and instructed Khalid al-Qasri to send Asad once again as governor to Khurasan. Early in 735, Harith renewed his rebellion. This time, whether due to pressure from local sympathizers in Marw or as an expedient way to gain time for Asad to arrive, Asim agreed to a truce with Harith, promising also to support Harith's demands against the Caliph. In early 735 Asad arrived once more to take up the governorship of Khurasan, this time accompanied by 20,000 Syrian troops, according to the 11th-century historian Gardizi. He imprisoned Asim for embezzling money and failing to campaign against the rebels, and immediately took the field himself. He soon gained the upper hand in a succession of victorious, if costly, battles with Harith's supporters. Asad's success was aided by his long-standing personal relations with the local Arab tribal leaders, as well as by the continuing tribal rivalries: as a Yamani opposed to the Mudari Harith, he could count on the support of his fellow tribesmen‚Äîthus most of the Rabi'ah, the traditional enemies of Harith's Tamim tribe, soon defected to him. Asad divided his forces, sending the Kufan and Syrian troops under Abd al-Rahman ibn Na'yum towards Marw Rudh, where Harith's main army was located, while he himself with the Basrans and remaining Khurasanis marched on the fortresses of Amul and Zamm. The rebel forces at Amul surrendered and were pardoned, and the garrison of Balkh followed soon after. Harith himself abandoned Marw Rudh and retreated across the Oxus before Abd al-Rahman, finding refuge with the princes of Tokharistan. With their aid, he laid siege to the major crossing point over the Oxus at Tirmidh. In the face of Harith's forces, Asad's troops could not cross the Oxus but retreated to Balkh. The Tirmidh garrison, however, managed to defeat Harith, who retired eastwards to the mountains of Badakhshan. Asad followed up this success by persuading the garrison of Zamm to surrender on promises of amnesty and double pay. Asad then led an expedition to recover Samarkand, which had been lost in the aftermath of the Defile. He failed to take the city, and returned to Balkh after destroying the sluices of the city's irrigation canals. The next year, 736, Asad's forces cleared the mountains of Upper Tokharistan from the remnants of Harith's supporters. Many of the latter, including some of Harith's relatives, were blockaded in the fortress of Tabushkhan by Asad's commander Juday al-Kirmani with 6,000 men, until they surrendered. According to al-Tabari, 400 of the men were executed, and the other defenders, including women and children, were sold into slavery. The same year, Asad moved the capital of Khurasan to Balkh. This decision was influenced by several factors: Balkh was the traditional, pre-Islamic capital and remained so in the eyes of the local population; it lay closer to Tokharistan, where Asad concentrated his military activities; and it was settled by reliable Syrians, removed from the factional politics of the Khurasani Arabs of Marw. At this time, Asad also captured and executed one of the leaders of the Khurasani Hashimiyya movement, Ammar ibn Yazid, known as Khidash, by crucifixion. In 737, Asad again led his troops north of the Oxus in a retaliatory campaign against Khuttal, whose ruler had allied himself with both Harith and the T√ºrgesh. While Asad captured a few fortresses and pillaged the land, the Khuttalan regent, Ibn al-Sa'iji, called for aid from the T√ºrgesh khagan, Suluk. The T√ºrgesh army's arrival caught the Arab troops, widely dispersed while ravaging the countryside, by surprise, and precipitated a headlong flight across the Oxus. The T√ºrgesh followed after them and attacked and almost annihilated the Arab baggage train, which Asad had sent ahead. The timely arrival of Asad's main army saved the baggage train's remnants, before both sides settled for winter quarters. Ominously for the Arabs, the khagan remained in Khurasan instead of retiring north, and Harith now emerged from hiding and joined him. Harith now counselled the khagan to take advantage of the dispersal of the Arab army to its winter quarters, and to resume his advance. In early December the khagan led the T√ºrgesh army, 30,000 strong with contingents from virtually every native ruler of Transoxiana and Upper Tokharistan, south. They bypassed Balkh and marched into Juzjan, hoping to raise the Hephthalite princes of Lower Tokharistan in revolt as well. In this the T√ºrgesh failed, as the king of Juzjan joined Asad, who was approaching with what forces he could muster. Asad's advance caught the khagan and Harith off guard; Asad came upon them near Kharistan, where they were accompanied by only 4,000 men, the rest having scattered to plunder and forage. In the ensuing Battle of Kharistan, Asad routed the T√ºrgesh. Harith and the khagan barely escaped and fled north over the Oxus. The T√ºrgesh detachments south of the Oxus were largely destroyed piecemeal by Juday al-Kirmani, ending the threat to Khurasan. After his victory over the T√ºrgesh, Asad sent an expedition against Badr Tarkhan, possibly a prince of Bamiyan in Ghur, who had taken advantage of the turmoil of the previous year and captured Khuttal. The expedition was successful, and Khuttal returned to Arab rule. A short while later, in February 738, Asad died at Balkh after a brief illness. Ja'far ibn Hanzala al-Bahrani succeeded him temporarily until, in July, Nasr ibn Sayyar was named to the governorship. Legacy Asad's second governorship was of crucial importance to the future of Central Asia. His victory at Kharistan averted a possible collapse of Muslim rule and ended the T√ºrgesh threat to Khurasan and Transoxiana. As Gibb writes, it was not only \\"the turning-point in the fortunes of the Arabs in Central Asia, but gave the signal for the downfall of T√ºrgesh power\\". The khagan‚Ä≤s defeat was a serious blow to his prestige, encouraging his domestic rivals, who assassinated him in early 738, backed secretly by the Chinese. The T√ºrgesh realm collapsed in civil war, leaving the Muslims without a serious opponent in the region. At the same time, Asad's excellent personal relationship with the native nobility strengthened their ties to the Arab government. As Gibb writes, \\"he was able to attract to his side many of the more influential elements in Lower Tokharistan and the Hephthalite lands‚Äîto this, in fact, was largely due his success in the struggle with the Turks.\\" His influence led to the conversion to Islam of several local rulers, like Saman Khuda and possibly also the Barmak. Even though as yet \\"practically confined to the ruling classes\\" and limited to the territories under direct Arab control, Gibb credits Asad with beginning a process of \\"true reconciliation\\". For this achievement he was greatly honoured by later generations, as attested in the work of the 10th-century Bukharan historian Narshakhi. His successor, Nasr ibn Sayyar, was able to build upon Asad's work and restore the Arab position over much of Transoxiana; Muslim pre-eminence over western Central Asia was sealed with the Battle of Talas in 751, and the withdrawal of Chinese influence after the outbreak of the An Lushan Rebellion.

Watkins also served from 1949 to 1956 as the first provost at the University of California, Riverside. Early life and education Watkins was born March 9, 1889 in Brynmawr, Wales to a poor Welsh coal miner. In 1906, he emigrated to the United States and attended Fargo College Academy in Fargo, North Dakota and Wheaton College Academy in Wheaton, Illinois. He received his A.B. from the University of Montana in 1914, his M.A. from the University of Illinois in 1915, and his Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1918. Professional life In 1925, Watkins joined the faculty at the University of California, Los Angeles as a professor of economics and later served as the Dean of the College of Letters and Science from 1936‚Äì1946. Robert Gordon Sproul, University of California President, named Watkins provost in 1949 and tasked him with establishing a new campus in Riverside, California. The University of California, Riverside opened in February 1954 as a result of Watkins' successful efforts to not only integrate the new campus with the pre-existing Citrus Experiment Station but to also gain widespread local public acceptance of the initiative. Watkins retired from the University of California, Riverside in 1956 and went on to serve as the acting dean of the new School of Education at the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1961‚Äì1962, and dean 1962‚Äì1965. In his memoirs, UC President Clark Kerr portrayed Watkins as a tragic figure who died a broken man. Kerr visited Watkins in Santa Barbara after his retirement and found that \\"this once cheerful and effervescent personality was mute and despondent.\\" Watkins came very close to creating one of the finest liberal arts colleges in the United States at Riverside, but his dream of a liberal arts college was immediately overtaken by politics and circumstances beyond his control, and the Board of Regents soon decided to turn Riverside into a full-fledged research university. In addition to his career as an educator, Watkins also served in varying capacities as an advisor and consultant. He was appointed by Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman as a member of fact- finding and labor arbitration boards, was a member of a federal mediation board panel, was an advisor to the Danish Committee on Public Monopolies, and counselor and director of the Building and Loan Institute of Los Angeles. Personal life Watkins met Anna Davis during his time at the University of Montana and the couple went on to get married. Death and legacy Gordon S. Watkins died on May 5, 1970 in Santa Barbara, California at the age of 81. The religious center at the University of California, Riverside was named Watkins House in his honor as was Watkins Hall which was named for him in 1966. The Watkins Oak was later planted beside Watkins 1000 to honor him as well and Watkins Drive runs past the Chancellor's residence on the outskirts of campus. The personal papers of Gordon Watkins' and his wife Anna were donated to the University of California, Riverside.

The studio is located at Coombe Works, Sherborne.  History  The station was originally known as Radio Sherborne broadcasting on 87.5 FM (on an RSL) and Online. Radio Sherborne was later rebranded as Abbey104 in February 2013 broadcasting on 104.7 FM. The idea of a local radio station for Sherborne was brought up in 2010 by Chris Tucker. He felt that the local community was neglected by broadcasters such as the BBC and commercial stations. This was most apparent in winter 2009-2010, where the area found itself in a news black spot for local weather and travel reports. The station is proposed as a way to bring community views, news and music to people of the town and surrounding areas. In 2010, the station received a National Lottery grant of ¬£9000 which helped towards start-up costs. The station is well supported and sponsored by local traders in the area. Oliver Letwin, a local MP, was invited to the official launch at the Eastbury Hotel, Sherborne along with representatives of the local Lions Club and Rotary Club. Abbey104's 1st birthday broadcasting on 104.7 FM was celebrated with a special outside broadcast at Sainsbury's in Sherborne. At the end of March 2014, Abbey104 ceased broadcasting from Georgian House, Greenhill, Sherborne, and moved to temporary studio premises at the Mermaid Pub in Sherborne, whilst the new studio was prepared at Coombe Works, Coombe, Sherborne. In April 2014, the studios were moved from the temporary premises at the Mermaid and commenced at Coombe Works where the station broadcasts from today. Currently the station is run by Taff Martin as Chairman since 2016 with Lynda Martin Treasurer, Terry Bennett Secretary, and Phil Clements, Nigel Phillips, Susan Hill and Alan Mapp as committee members. Abbey104 has gone from strength to strength over last two years and becoming a much needed part of the community. With Directors, Bonny Sartin, Jane Smith and Kevin Gould. In February 2018 Abbey104 was given a new 5 year extension to its licence, committing the station to serve the local community for the foreseeable future with a fantastic collection of old and new hits which are programmed when studios are unmanned to entertain the listener without the same tired collection of 80s hits other stations use. Presenters on Abbey104 include Paul Peters, who has been working as a DJ since the days of pirate radio back in 1960's, the station's Programme Controller Phil Clements and Tiggy Walker (who can also be heard sometimes on her husband's Sounds of the Seventies show on BBC Radio 2), who had a programme each Thursday from August 2018 called \\"Afternoon Delight\\".https://www.somersetlive.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/wife-johnnie- walker-mbe-tiggy-1866576https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000khdk  Transmission  The main frequency for Abbey104 is on 104.7 MHz FM and emits 25 watts from a transmitter located at The Gryphon School, Sherborne. A STL is used to communicate between the studio in Coombe, to the transmitter site. The station broadcast range is approximately 12-15 mile radius around Sherborne. This includes Wincanton to the north and Cerne Abbas to the south, towards Martock to the west and Shaftesbury to the east.

Research =Master's thesis= Spencer master's thesis, titled \\"Effects of Systematic Social and Token Reinforcement on the Modification of Racial and Color Concept Attitudes in Black and in White Preschool Children,\\" was inspired by the doll studies of Kenneth and Mamie Clark and investigated whether children's racial beliefs and preferences could be modified by incentives. The study included 24 Black and 24 White children between the ages of 3-5, who all attended a Head Start program serving lower-class families. In the control condition, children were asked to choose between drawings of Black or White animals and children; this baseline found that the children in the study showed a 70% - 80% bias towards the White stimuli. In the experimental condition, a Black or White mechanized puppet taught the children to choose the Black stimuli by rewarding them with marbles; this intervention reduced bias towards the White stimulus to only 40%. Spencer concluded that the children had learned implicit biases during their childhood, but that the initial preference towards White stimulus could be reversed with incentives, suggesting that initial bias was more related to learned attitudes than an internalized self-hatred as suggested by the Clarks. =PhD Dissertation= Spencer's PhD dissertation was a continuation of her master's degree work looking at racial preferences among children, but with a focus on the confidence and self-esteem of Black children that exhibited biases towards White stimuli. Her dissertation studied 130 Black children from six preschools in the South Side of Chicago. This work determined that while the children showed significant bias against the color black and Black people, and favored the color white and White people, these attitudes were not internalized by the children, allowing them to maintain healthy self-esteem despite implicit anti-Black attitudes. =PVEST Theory= Built off of Urie Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory, Spencer developed the Phenomenological Variant of Ecological Systems (PVEST) Theory as a framework to examine strength and resiliency, especially during the process of identity formation in adolescents. PVEST addresses the social, historical, and cultural context in which youths develop, and as well as the perceptions and self-appraisals that individuals use to form their identity. The PVEST Theory breaks identity formation into the following five components: :# Net Vulnerability level: history of prior experiences and coping outcomes. :# Net stress engagement: actual experience that challenges individual's well being. :# Reactive coping methods: employed to resolve dissonance-producing situations. :# Emergent identities: coping strategies are repeated, become stable, and combine with self-appraisal to form identity. :# Life-stage, specific coping outcomes: identity affects future behavior and outcomes (self- esteem, achievement, health, etc.). The APA Task Force on Resilience and Strength in Black Children and Adolescents describes Spencer's PVEST theory as \\"a seminal and important contribution to the study of resilience among African American children and youth\\" (p. 34) for being one of the only theories taking into account the \\"ecological contextual circumstances unique to youths of color in the United States\\" (p. 23) =Acting White= In a 2008 publication titled \\"What does ‚Äòacting White‚Äô actually mean?,\\" Margaret Beale Spencer and Vinay Harpalani addressed John Ogbu and Signithia Fordham's widely cited \\"Black students' school success: Coping with the burden of 'acting White,'\\" which proposed the Acting White hypothesis, the idea that African-American communities devalue academic achievement because success in school is seen as an attribute of White dominant culture. Spencer and Harpalani cite data that suggests that African-American families have just as much investment in their children's academic success, and that high-achieving African-American students have higher social status than their peers, opposite to what would be presumed under the Acting White Hypothesis. Spencer and Harpalani also found conceptual problems with Ogbu and Fordham's approach, saying: :\\"‚Ä¶ the analysis presented by Fordham and Ogbu lacks a normative, developmental perspective; it fails to view African American youth as normal, developing beings who are maturing in a hostile context of racial inequity. \\" [p.10] The article concludes that Acting White is simply one of many coping response that Black youths employ and is not responsible for academic underachievement.

It debuted on the BBC Red Button service after the broadcast of \\"The Day of the Doctor\\", the official 50th anniversary special. The programme was written and directed by Peter Davison, who stars alongside fellow former Doctor actors Sylvester McCoy, Colin Baker, and Paul McGann. It features appearances from more recent stars of the show David Tennant, Matt Smith, Jenna Coleman, and John Barrowman, as well as Doctor Who executive producer Steven Moffat, his predecessor Russell T Davies, and numerous others connected to the programme, all playing themselves in a more or less parodic manner. The plot focuses on the fictionalised, disgruntled Davison, Baker and McCoy, who become embroiled in misadventures as they attempt to sneak onto the set of the official Doctor Who 50th anniversary special. The Five(ish) Doctors Reboot was nominated for the 2014 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (Short Form), (along with \\"The Day of the Doctor\\", An Adventure in Space and Time, \\"The Name of the Doctor\\", and episodes of Game of Thrones and Orphan Black). Plot picket props that were used in the episode. On Christmas Day 2012, former Fifth Doctor actor Peter Davison watches \\"The Snowmen\\" with his children. They remark on the upcoming 50th anniversary special and speculate as to whether Davison will be invited to return or if it will simply feature the most recent two Doctors, David Tennant and Matt Smith. Davison has a dream where he is invited back and given special treatment, ending with a vision of Janet Fielding telling him that none of the old Doctors will be asked to return. Over the next couple of months, he, Sixth Doctor actor Colin Baker and Seventh Doctor actor Sylvester McCoy desperately await a call inviting them to star in the special. A disillusioned Davison attends a convention, where he is unrecognised by the hotel receptionist and asked by fans if he has heard about appearing in the episode. He calls current Doctor Who executive producer Steven Moffat, who is more interested in playing with his action figures and deletes his messages from Davison, as well as Baker and McCoy who have also called about appearing (McCoy mentions appearing in The Hobbit and Baker mentions doing I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!). At another convention appearance, Davison, Baker and McCoy all eye Eighth Doctor actor Paul McGann suspiciously. They discuss inviting Fourth Doctor actor Tom Baker to help them get involved, but when they call him he is revealed to be stuck in the Time Vortex again. McGann, having received no Doctor Who news from his agent, says he wants in on their plans ‚Äì \\"work permitting, obviously.\\" After the convention, McCoy returns to New Zealand to continue filming The Hobbit, but decides to return to England after director Peter Jackson leaves him sitting around doing nothing. Davison's scheme is revealed to involve the three of them (McGann has work commitments) protesting with picket signs outside the BBC Television Centre in London. Meanwhile, back in New Zealand, McCoy's disappearance has ruined a scene with Ian McKellen, though McKellen himself says to Jackson that the scene might be \\"a slight improvement\\" without McCoy. In London, a passing John Barrowman informs the three actors that Doctor Who filming now takes place in Cardiff. Barrowman abandons his secret wife and children to drive the trio there, singing show tunes all the way and giving them each a copy of one of his CDs. The former Doctors enter the Doctor Who Experience, steal their old costumes, and with the help of Davison's son-in-law David Tennant are able to infiltrate Roath Lock and get onto the set of the 50th anniversary special, \\"The Day of the Doctor\\". They are initially unsure how to proceed with getting in the special, but end up taking the place of the three Dalek operators after locking them in their room. After a close call with some security guards which leads to the trio having to hide back on the set, they manage to escape and catch a bus back to London. Davison receives a call and ignores it; it turns out to be former Doctor Who executive producer Russell T Davies asking for a part in Davison's project, as he has also been left out of the 50th celebrations. In the coda, Moffat deletes the scene where the former Doctors play Daleks. However, when Moffat's editor reviews another scene, he sees the former Doctors evade the on-set security guards by hiding under shrouds in the undergallery set; the editor conceals this from Moffat, ensuring that the former Doctors appear in the special after all. (Colin Baker has since confirmed during a London ComicCon Q&A; session that he, Peter, and Sylvester were genuinely \\"hiding\\" under the \\"shrouds\\" while the scene was being filmed for the 50th anniversary broadcast, so spoof/fiction became reality).

Home media After months of speculation, on 23 July 2014 it was officially announced that The Five(ish) Doctors Reboot would be released on DVD and Blu- ray on 8 September 2014 alongside \\"The Name of the Doctor\\", \\"The Night of the Doctor\\", \\"The Day of the Doctor\\", \\"The Time of the Doctor\\" and An Adventure in Space and Time as part of the limited edition \\"50th Anniversary Collectors Edition\\" boxset. Proposed sequel In June 2014, Eighth Doctor Paul McGann revealed that production had begun on a sequel to the special. No release date, plot or cast details were offered. However, in July 2014, Sixth Doctor Colin Baker contradicted McGann's earlier statement by telling Flicks and the City that \\"All I know is when I last spoke to Peter [Davison] the reaction to Five-ish Doctors has been so positive that we discussed whether it was a good idea to do another one and we agreed that we didn‚Äôt want to do one that was a pale imitation of the first.

Sacraments, along with preaching of God's word, are means of grace through which God offers Christ to people. Sacraments are believed to have their effect through the Holy Spirit, but these effects are only believed to be beneficial to those who have faith in Christ. In Reformed theology, baptism is the sacrament of initiation into the visible church, or body of people who publicly claim faith in Christ. Baptism also signifies regeneration and remission of sin. Reformed Christians believe that the children of those who express faith in Christ should be baptized. Because baptism is believed to be beneficial only to those who have faith in Christ, infants are baptized on the basis of the promise of faith which will come to fruition later in life.  History  =Background= Christian baptismal theology prior to the Reformation taught that sacraments, including baptism, are means or instruments through which God communicates grace to people. The sacrament was considered valid regardless of who administered it. Not everyone who received a sacrament, however, received the grace signified by the sacrament. Some medieval theologians spoke of an obstacle of mortal sin which blocks the grace of the sacrament, while others insisted that the recipient be positively open and responding in faith to the sacrament in order to receive any benefit. Baptism was believed to be used by the Holy Spirit to transform the believer, and offered the benefits of remission of sins, regeneration, and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. The sacrament of penance was believed to be necessary for forgiveness for sins committed after baptism. During the Reformation, Martin Luther rejected many of the Catholic Church's seven sacraments, but retained baptism and the Lord's Supper. He saw many practices of the medieval church as abuses of power intended to require work in order to merit forgiveness for sin after baptism rather than faith alone. Luther attached the promise of salvation to baptism, and taught that life after baptism should be spent in recollection of it and the dying to sin it signified. =Reformation and Reformed orthodoxy= Huldrych Zwingli, the earliest theologian considered part of the Reformed tradition, was vigorously opposed to worship practices he believed to be based on tradition rather than the Bible. Nevertheless, he disagreed with Anabaptists, who refused to baptize their children on scriptural grounds. Through his arguments with Anabaptists, Zwingli arrived at the position that baptism was a sign of the covenant between God and his people, but that it did not convey grace to the baptized. He saw baptism as essentially identical to the circumcision of Israelites in the Old Testament in this respect, and used this idea in polemics against Anabaptists. Zwingli's emphasis on baptism as a pledge or oath was to prove unique in the Reformed tradition. Heinrich Bullinger, Zwingli's successor, continued the teaching of the continuity of God's covenants and circumcision with baptism. Bullinger also emphasized that baptism indicates duties to the baptized in response to God's grace. John Calvin was influenced by Martin Luther's idea of baptism as God's promises to the baptized person attached to the outward sign of washing with water. Calvin maintained Zwingli's idea of baptism as a public pledge, but insisted that it was secondary to baptism's meaning as a sign of God's promise to forgive sin. He maintained that sacraments were effective instruments in bringing about the promises they represent, however he also maintained that the promises could be refused by the baptized, and would have no effect in that case. Calvin carefully distinguished between the outward sign of the washing of water with the promises that baptism signifies while maintaining that they were inseparable. Calvin's baptismal theology is very similar to that of Luther. It differs in the way Calvin subordinated sacraments to the preaching of the word of God. While Luther placed preaching and sacraments on the same level, Calvin saw sacraments as confirmation which is added to the preaching of the word of God. In this painting of the Huguenot Temple de Lyon, a woman stands next to the pulpit with a pitcher and a man with a towel in preparation for a baptism. From the end of the sixteenth century through the eighteenth century, a period known as Reformed orthodoxy, Reformed baptismal theology further developed the covenantal meaning of baptism. Theologians more carefully defined the sacramental union of baptism, or the relationship between the outward washing with that which it signifies. In the high orthodox period (middle to late seventeenth century), theologians such as Hermann Witsius expanded the covenantal meaning of baptism using analogies such as Noah's Ark and the crossing of the Red Sea, which carried the theological themes of the resurrection and eternal life. This period also saw the emergence of Reformed Baptists. Reformed Baptist theologians had much in common with the Reformed, but saw baptism as a sign of the baptized's fellowship with Christ rather than a sign and seal of the covenant of grace, and as a result did not baptize their children. =Modern= Friedrich Schleiermacher, an influential nineteenth-century Reformed theologian, saw baptism as the way the church receives new members and taught that faith is a precondition for baptism. He was ambivalent about the practice of infant baptism, teaching that it was not an essential institution, but could be continued as long as the church was faithful in bringing children to confirmation. Schleiermacher also saw baptism as primarily individual rather than initiating one into a covenant community, and rejected the idea that baptism should be connected with Old Testament circumcision. Scottish nineteenth-century Reformed theologian William Cunningham also sought to articulate a distinctively Reformed theology of baptism in the modern world. Cunningham preferred the writings of Zwingli on the sacraments, writing that Calvin and later Reformed orthodox theologians overly elevated the value of the sacraments. He argued that the efficacy of baptism only applies to adults expressing faith in the act of baptism. In the twentieth century, Karl Barth, an influential Swiss Reformed theologian, argued that baptism should not be administered to infants because it represented a completed association with Christ which could only be accepted or rejected by adults. Further, Barth in his later years rejected the idea that baptism was actually used by God to accomplish anything, or could even properly be called a sacrament. Instead, he taught that water baptism is a human act of obedience. His views have been called \\"neo-Zwinglian\\" for this reason, and he himself identified Zwingli's views on sacraments as the believer's oath as his own. He continued to accept the validity of infant baptisms, and did not believe those baptized as infants should be rebaptized. Later Reformed theologians reacted against Barth's views on baptism by appealing to Calvin, the idea that baptism is a promise rather than an accomplished reality, and the idea of baptism as a replacement of circumcision. Scottish Reformed theologian T.F. Torrance emphasized the idea that baptism is God's word establishing the church, and that the individual's response comes after rather than before God's act in baptism. German Reformed liberation theologian J√ºrgen Moltmann, on the other hand, saw infant baptism as inappropriately associated with the national church. He saw baptism as properly a free response God's call to discipleship. Reformed churches have generally maintained the practice of infant baptism despite these critiques. Sacramental theology Baptism in Scotland by John Phillip In Reformed theology, sacraments are held to be, along with the word of God preached, the means of grace. In the sacraments, God graciously condescends to use common material objects to communicate divine promises to people. The grace promised consists not only in benefits which God bestows on people, but Christ's person himself, to whom God unites the believer. Sacraments confirm or ratify the promises communicated in preaching. Both preaching and the sacraments are not merely symbolic and representative of the reality to which they refer, but actually create the reality of saving grace. The sacraments are made efficacious by the Holy Spirit in actually bringing into effect the promises signified in the sacraments. This efficacy is only beneficial, however, for those who have faith. The sacrament remains efficacious regardless of the recipient's response. Its effect is negative, resulting in judgement, for the faithless; while it confers Christ and his benefits for the faithful. Reformed theologians believe sacraments to be instituted in the context of covenants between God and people. They believe that when God makes covenants, he provides physical signs associated with the covenant. Old Testament covenant signs include the rainbow which appeared following a covenant made with Noah. Circumcision is believed to be a sign of God's covenant with Abraham and his descendants. Such signs entail blessings and sanctions on those with whom God covenants. In the New Testament period there are two such signs or sacraments: baptism and the Lord's Supper. In Reformed sacramental theology, the sign (in the case of baptism the external washing with water) may be described in terms of the thing signified (regeneration, remission of sin, etc.), because of the close connection between them. For example, baptism may be said to save, and baptism is often called the \\"laver of regeneration\\". However, there is also a distinction between the sign and thing signified. The sign is seen as a pledge and seal of the inward washing of regeneration and purification. The sacramental union between the sign and thing signified means that the use or purpose of the visible action of the sacrament is changed even as its substance remains the same. Meaning The Reformed tradition holds that baptism is primarily God's promise or offer of grace to the baptized. Baptism is said to signify union with Christ in his death, burial, and resurrection. The baptized is made one with Christ's person, meaning God the Father treats them the same as he treats Christ. Baptism also unites the baptized with Christ's history, meaning that the person can be said to have died, been buried, and raised again just as Christ was. The baptized person's identity in Christ is based on Christ's action in baptism rather than the person's action. This union also unites Christians to one another. Through the words of institution used in baptism, Christians are also united to each of the members of the trinity. The Circumcision by Jacob Jordaens. Reformed theologians see baptism as the replacement or perfection of circumcision. In the Reformed tradition, baptism's function as a rite of initiation into the church is secondary to its function as a sign of God's promise of grace. Reformed theologians distinguish between the visible church, which consists of those who publicly claim to have faith in Christ as well as their children; and the invisible church, which consists of those who actually have faith and have been regenerated. Baptism is believed to make one a member of the visible, rather than the invisible church. It is believed to be impossible to know who is a member of the invisible church. As members of the visible church, baptized Christians are believed to have obligations to live in love and service to Christ and his people. The fulfillment of these obligations is referred to as the \\"improvement\\" of one's baptism. Reformed Christians see baptism as a replacement of circumcision in the Old Testament. Baptism does everything for New Testament Christians that circumcision did for Jews in the Old Testament. Circumcision is seen as a ritual where God's judgement passes over the person circumcised, only to cut off a part of the flesh, sparing the rest of the person. The \\"cutting off\\" of Christ in death is seen as a perfection of circumcision, and in baptism similarly the entire body is subjected to judgement and death in order to be raised again in new life. Reformed Christians believe baptism to be a sign of regeneration, or the making of one into a new creature, based on the connection found in the New Testament between regeneration and washing with water. Baptism also represents forgiveness or remission of sin by the sprinkling of the blood of Christ, similarly to the sprinkling of blood of sacrificial animals. Baptism is held by almost the entire Reformed tradition to effect regeneration, even in infants who are incapable of faith, by effecting faith which would come to fruition later. However, Reformed theologians do not teach that baptism is necessarily bound to the forgiveness of sins. Not everyone who participates in the outward rite of baptism can be said to have had their sins forgiven. Rather, it is necessary that the baptized person participate spiritually by faith in order to receive this benefit. Infant baptism . Protestant reformers emphasized the place of children in the believing community, leading to their increased presence in religious art. With some notable exceptions, Reformed Christians baptize infants who are born to believing parents. Reformed Christians do so on the basis of the continuity from the old covenant between God and Israel and the new covenant with the church, since infants were circumcised under the old covenant. They also see God's saving purpose in the new covenant as having to do with families as well as individuals. Because Reformed Christians believe baptism must be embraced by faith to have any benefit, they recognize that faith may come later in life rather than preceding baptism. Infants may also be said to possess a seed of faith which will come to fruition later, or baptism may be administered based on a promise of faith offered by their sponsors (usually their parents) which will be kept at a later age. Mode and administration Reformed Christians believe that immersion is not necessary for baptism to be properly performed, but that pouring or sprinkling are acceptable. Sprinkling is said to symbolize the sprinkling of the blood of Christ for the removal of the guilt of sin. Only ordained ministers are permitted to administer baptism in Reformed churches, contrary to the allowance for emergency baptism by midwives in Roman Catholic churches, though baptisms performed by non-ministers are generally considered valid. Reformed churches, while rejecting the baptismal ceremonies of the Roman Catholic church (such as the use of chrism, salt, and insufflation), accept the validity of baptisms performed with them on the basis that the substance of baptism remains. They do not rebaptize someone who has been baptized using these ceremonies because baptism is never to be repeated.

He is currently based in Seattle, Washington. Abeo is a member of the hip hop group Common Market along with DJ/Producer Sabzi. Abeo, with his wife, manages the independent record label SCIONtific Records. Early life Ryan Abeo was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky in 1974. Abeo began writing and recording hip hop lyrics when he was twelve years old, after being introduced to the 1980s hip hop group Fat Boys. By the time he was a senior in high school, he was experiencing tensions with school authorities, which led him to drop out completely. Still pursuing hip hop, he attended Northern Kentucky University, before dropping out. Following this, he settled in Seattle, Washington, where he would become a notable figure to the Northwest hip hop scene. Musical career Soon after Abeo moved to Seattle, he met Sabzi, a DJ/Producer who was at the time just forming his group Blue Scholars with Geologic, through the local hip hop circuit. The two got along as friends and bonded over their shared Baha'i Faith. Sabzi began collaboration by giving a few instrumentals to RA which went on his first project, Live & Learn. Together, the two officially formed the group Common Market, which would become a staple in putting Northwest hip hop in a prime position. Since then, he has released four studio albums as RA Scion and a 5th album with Gifted Youngstaz as the duo \\"TRUEFORM\\". Personal life Abeo has a wife named Mariangela and one child named Madison. As a family, they have lived all around the world, from Crete, Greece to Zambia, Africa. Style and influences He cites Chuck D, A Tribe Called Quest and De La Soul as important influences.

Whilst studying History at the University of Edinburgh he became fascinated by the end of the Colonial period in West Africa. At St Andrews University he studied Imperial history and was shocked when he realised how little he was taught about the violence underpinning colonialism, for example the Benin Massacre and it was this need to reveal some of this truth which provoked him to write the novel.Interview: Luke Williams on The Echo Chamber from the Scottish Book Trust.

At the beginning of the twelfth century, he enjoyed the favor of Sultan Muhammad. However, in 1118, when Muhammad's son Mahmud II ascended the throne, Garshasp fell into disgrace; slander about him spread to the court that made him lose confidence, and made Mahmud send a military force to Yazd where Garshasp was arrested and jailed in Jibal, while Yazd was granted to the royal cupbearer. Garshasp, however, escaped and returned to Yazd, where he requested protection from Ahmad Sanjar (Garshasp's wife was the sister of Ahmad). Garshasp urged Ahmad to invade the domains of Mahmud II in Central Persia, and gave him information on how to march to Central Persia, and the ways to combat Mahmud II. Ahmad accepted and advanced with an army to the west in 1119, where he together with five kings defeated Mahmud II at Saveh. The kings who aided Ahmad during the battle was Garshasp himself, the Emir of Sistan and the Khwarazm-Shah, including two other unnamed kings. After being victorious, Ahmad then restored the domains of Garshasp II.

It lies on the Pacific Ocean at the southernmost end of La Jolla, just north of Pacific Beach. The mostly residential neighborhood includes homes for 1,400 to 1,500 families, with a commercial district along the main street, La Jolla Boulevard. The shore is rocky and has no beach, but offshore reefs are used for surfing. History The neighborhood is named for an offshore rock that was described as having the shape of a bird and is often photographed with brown pelicans or other birds perching on it. The rock formerly included an arch with an opening under it, but the arch was eroded by wave action and finally collapsed in December 2010. The neighborhood was subdivided by pioneer developer Michael Francis Hall in 1906. He named it Bird Rock City by the Sea. During World War II the area housed a unit of the Coast Artillery called the Bird Rock Coastal Defense and Anti-Aircraft Training Center. The area was thinly populated until a population explosion in the 1950s. Bird Rock Elementary School opened in 1951. In 2005 the community installed a controversial series of roundabouts along La Jolla Boulevard and narrowed the street from four lanes to two, in an attempt to reduce traffic speed and discourage cut-through driving while encouraging visits to local businesses. The area attracted unwanted attention in 2008, when local professional surfer Emery Kauanui died after an altercation with members of a local gang who called themselves the Bird Rock Bandits. The 26th season of MTV's The Real World was filmed in Bird Rock in 2011. Community associations The La Jolla Community Planning Association advises the city on matters involving Bird Rock.

Through its work of defending the high seas on the high street it seeks to educate people about the issues facing the only truly wild items stocked by supermarkets and to empower its supporters to help change the way fish is consumed. The charity's goal is to encourage retailers to put conservation before commerce. Founded in the UK in 2004 by Graham Buckingham the charity's online campaigns have primarily focused on encouraging restaurants and retailers to stop selling endangered fish species and make Britain's retailers shark-free. Bite-Back is working to ‚Äòdevalue‚Äô a dead shark by ending the profit opportunities for all shark and shark-derived products in the UK including shark fin soup, shark cartilage, shark jaws, shark teeth and oils.  Consumer campaigns  = Supermarket Protests = Successes from its supermarket campaign include persuading Japanese-inspired restaurant chain Wagamama to remove shark from its menu, encouraging supermarket giant Asda to take shark off its shelves across the UK and Mary Berry - British chef, food writer and judge on the Great British Bake Off - to remove a shark recipe from her cookery book. = Hacked Off = Its 'Hacked Off' campaign, which aims to halt the sale of shark fin soup in the United Kingdom, inspired the London-based Michelin-starred Chinese restaurant Hakkasan to stop selling the controversial soup. Having spearheaded efforts across the UK to reduce shark fin sales, in 2018 the charity reported that the number of British restaurants serving shark fin soup had reduced by 82%. As part of the organisation's quest to devalue a dead shark and make the UK shark-free, Bite-Back encourages its supporters to contribute to its 'shark sightings' map, a comprehensive collection of shops, fishmongers and restaurants which still continue to sell shark products. In 2014 it worked with one of its fundraising partners, Sea Life London Aquarium, to capitalise on the Chinese New Year to rally supporters and raise awareness of shark finning by distributing ‚Äòmis-fortune cookies‚Äô containing special messages focusing on the issue. = No Fin To Declare = After collaborating with The Independent's Oscar Quine to call a top London restaurant's shark fin supply into question, Bite-Back worked with Trading Standards and Westminster City Council to investigate their source. The Royal China Club was subsequently found to have been illegally importing shark fins for its ¬£38 a bowl soup. Having exposed a loophole in European legislation that allows anyone entering Europe to bring 20 kg of dried shark fins, the charity launched its No Fin To Declare campaign in April 2015. Bite-Back maintains that each 20 kg haul can make 700 bowls of shark fin soup and, at ¬£180 per kilo, be worth over ¬£3,600, prompting restaurants to abuse personal import allowances as a 'back door' for the unregulated introduction of shark fins to the restaurant trade. The charity is currently working with the Marine Species Conservation team at DEFRA and Green MEP Jean Lambert to change the personal import allowance, re-evaluate the legislation and vote to make it illegal to bring any shark fins into the EU.  Media activity = Mind Your Language = In July 2018 Bite-Back launched a campaign for responsible shark journalism,https://www.bite-back.com/2018/07/30/mind-your-language/ reminding media that Jaws was not a documentary and calling for the press to stop describing sharks as 'killers', 'monsters' and 'beasts'. Supported by celebrities including Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Steve Backshall, the charity's \\"Media Guidelines\\" aim to help UK and international press report shark encounters more accurately and in a way that won't thwart shark conservation initiatives. The campaign also received the support of Wendy Benchley, wife of Jaws author Peter Benchley, who worked with her husband as a marine conservation advocate to overcome the excessive fear of sharks prompted by the novel. Bite-Back's quest to inspire responsible shark journalism inspired much debate across national radio stations, with campaign director Graham Buckingham interviewed by UK stations including Heart,https://www.heart.co.uk/southwest/news/local/stop-calling-sharks-man- eaters/ LBChttps://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/presenters/nick-ferrari/nick-ferraris- brilliant-response-sharks-cows/ and on the BBC Radio 2 Breakfast Show, hosted by Chris Evans (presenter).https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06gsrhy/ = Shocking Shark Stats = Researchhttps://www.bite- back.com/2017/11/26/shocking-shark-statistics/ commissioned by Bite-Back in November 2017 into attitudes towards sharks and the oceans found that Brits are in love with the oceans, but not with sharks. While 83% think more should be done to protect the world's oceans, the charity found that 46% of Brits think sharks are more terrifying than spiders, snakes and rodents combinedhttps://metro.co.uk/2018/07/14/without-sharks-the-worlds-oceans-are- ruined-7636456/ while nearly two-thirds (64%) would prefer sharks not to exist. The survey into public perception of the apex predator highlighted the need for educational efforts to highlight the importance of sharks at a time when humans kill 73 million sharks a year. Of the three sharks easily named by the public - great white (89%), hammerhead (80%) and tiger (67%) - each have seen populations plummet by as much as 90% in some parts of the world in the past 50 years.https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/feb/18/conservation.aaas  Recognition  * In 2014 Bite-Back secured a three-year partnership deal with Sea Life London Aquarium, including funding to develop further educational and engagement programmes. As part of this, the charity was presented with a designated area at the high-profile visitor attraction to deliver its campaign messages and also celebrated its tenth anniversary in October 2014 with a VIP birthday party. * In 2012 Bite-Back worked with the international advertising agency Ogilvy & Mather to produce a TV commercial entitled \\"Fin - help end the horror\\". Created to highlight the barbaric practice of shark-finning, the advert was deemed too graphic for TV viewing. Receiving an 18-certificate cinema rating, the hard-hitting black and white ad went on to be shortlisted for a Panda award for 'best campaign film' at the Wildscreen Festival the same year. * Bite-Back's shark fin soup campaign has received celebrity support from renowned chefs, including Gordon Ramsay and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, Charles Clover, author of 'The End of the Line: How overfishing is changing the world and what we eat' plus British actor Martin Clunes. * The charity's founder, Graham Buckingham, has spoken at two TEDx events; the first in November 2016 on \\"Defending Jaws\\" and the second in January 2018 revealing \\"The Terrifying Truth About Sharks\\" * Its annual fundraising calendar also unites some of the world's most acclaimed underwater photographers, including David Doubilet, Brian Skerry, Alex Mustard and Doug Perrine.

Possibly the central arcade supporting the vaulting of its two aisles may be ancient. This arcade is carried on two circular columns with cushion capitals and between them is a singular looking font on a platform which is said to be used for a ceremony on the festival of the Epiphany. The baldachino of stone over the altar and the iconostasis appear to be of the same date as the modern rebuilding in 1854. There are several ancient icons (traditionally said to have been brought from Ayia Sophia in Constantinople after the Turkish conquest), one of which is of unusually large size. Another is dated 1529. In the narthex amongst other fragments is a small basso-relievo of the Madonna and Child under a canopy, common rustic work of the 15th century.\\"A description of the historic monuments of Cyprus.

The church stands close to Chrysaliniotissa church and very near the Green line. It has an 18th- century iconostasis and a number of valuable icons, some of which have been removed to the Byzantine Museum of the Archbishop Makarios Ill Foundation. The bones and scull of St. Cassian, a 4th-century Roman saint, are kept in a golden box in the church. Another treasure of the church is a silver helmet of the saint believed to be miraculous and recommended for those suffering from headaches.Touring Guide to Nicosia (Greek and English), publ by Selas, Nicosia 2012 The church is dedicated to St. Cassian the Roman, whose saint day is 29 February and is thus celebrated every four years.

In November 2009, the pair purchased Nashville Shores, consisting of a marina, RV park and water park. They redeveloped the water park for the 2010 season. In early 2011, it was announced the pair had purchased the Ocean Breeze Waterpark in Virginia with plans to renovate it for the 2011 season. In 2011, the newly founded Premier Attractions Management began operating three properties owned by CNL Lifestyle Properties: Frontier City, SplashTown Houston, and White Water Bay CNL Lifestyle Properties had terminated its lease agreements with PARC Management for eight parks in late 2010. Burke and Story have since gained operational control of additional parks owned by CNL Lifestyle Properties. In 2013, the company changed its name to Premier Parks, LLC taking the former corporate name of the company that had acquired and took the name of Six Flags. In late 2016, CNL Lifestyle Properties sold their attractions portfolio to EPR Properties. Upon this transaction, EPR transferred management of these parks to Premier Parks, LLC, including ones previously operated by different groups. In May 2017, operations of Waterworld California were transferred to Six Flags Entertainment Corporation, which had previously owned the park and also own the nearby Six Flags Discovery Kingdom. In May 2018, Six Flags announced that they had entered into a purchase agreement with Premier Parks to acquire the lease rights to operate 5 additional parks: Darien Lake, Frontier City, Wet'n'Wild Phoenix, Wet'n'Wild SplashTown, and White Water Bay.

From 1690 he was Court apothecary to King William III, Queen Anne and King George I. Early life Westhorpe House Chase was the eldest son of John Chase of Littlebrook, Kent and his wife Elizabeth Soane, daughter of Dr Thomas Soane, canon of Windsor. His father was court apothecary to Charles II, and James II, having succeeded his own father in 1666, who was court apothecary to Charles I and, after the Restoration, to Charles II. Chase matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford on 15 December 1665, aged 15. He married Elizabeth Box, daughter of Sir Ralph Box of Cheapside, London on 17 November 1677. In 1684, he acquired his estate in Little Marlow and built Westhorpe House there during Queen Anne's reign. Court apothecary Chase was a Freeman of the Apothecaries‚Äô Company and was its Master from June 1688 to September 1689. His father's patent granted the reversion of the office to Chase himself, and after his father's death in 1690, Chase became court apothecary to William III in June 1690, at an annual salary of ¬£115, with an annual allowance of ¬£127 and lodgings in Whitehall. He was subsequently court apothecary to Queen Anne and King George I. Political career At the 1690 English general election Chase was returned as Member of Parliament for Great Marlow in Buckinghamshire. He was returned again unopposed in 1695, 1698 and in the two general elections of 1701. He was unopposed again at the 1702 English general election and 1705 English general election. In June 1706 he was appointed a commissioner for sick and wounded, but resigned the following May. At the 1708 British general election he was returned in a contest as a Whig. He voted for the naturalization of the Palatines in 1709 and for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell in 1710. At the 1710 British general election he was mixed up in a double return and waived his right of election on 8 December 1710. He was defeated at Marlow at the 1715 British general election. Death and legacy Chase died without issue on 23 June 1721 leaving his estate to his widow and Dr Stephen Chase, the eldest son of his cousin, also Stephen Chase.

He made his way to Anchorage, Alaska, and in 1973 he beat 22-year-old Robert Johnson who worked as a grocery clerk to death in Earthquake Park. He was charged with murder and found not guilty by reason of insanity and sent to a mental hospital in California. In 1980 psychiatrists decided that his illness was in remission and he was returned to Alaska under the supervision of the Alaska Psychiatric Institute. On May 3, 1982, armed with a .38-caliber revolver that he had bought from a man on the street, he shot four teenagers to death in Russian Jack Springs Park; two 19-year-old boys while robbing their campsite and two 16-year-old girls who came to investigate the gunshots.Wallace Turner (June 22, 1982). \\"New law on insanity plea stirs dispute in Alaska\\".

Palm Beach Post, Mar 31, 1983. In response to the shootings, the Alaska Legislature revised the criminal statutes on the sentencing of the mentally ill, providing for a new verdict \\"guilty, but mentally ill\\" where the convicted will serve their time in a mental institution until deemed healthy, then be transferred to prison for the rest of their sentence. This revision did not apply to Meach's trial, or consequently his sentence. The legislature also narrowed the definition of insanity and tightened the burden of proof for the basic insanity defense. This resulted in Alaska having one of the strictest conditions for the insanity defense of all US states.DeBusk, Suzan E. \\"Alaska's Insanity Defense and the Guilty but Mentally Ill Verdict.\\" Alaska L.

His collection of watercolour drawings of Lepidoptera larvae are held at the Natural History Museum, London Natural History Museum - Arthur Miles-Moss (1873-1948) who bought them from his patron Lionel Walter, Baron Rothschild.  Biography  Miles-Moss was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge from 1891 to 1894, where he was a choral scholar of King's College and president of the Natural History Society. From 1895 to 1898 he was curate of Holy Trinity, Birkenhead, then curate at Kendal Parish Church, and from 1901 to 1907 he was precentor of Norwich Cathedral. Although continuing a career in the church his passion was lepidoptera (moths and butterflies), so he jumped at the chance to work for the Anglican church in South America. Miles-Moss became expert on South American lepidoptera and produced a lot of valuable research, including specimens and drawings which are still in use today in the Natural History Museum. He achieved wider fame for having the largest parish in the world while based in a remote part of Brazil. He was also a talented artist, painting many landscapes, seascapes and tree studies, and his paintings have been exhibited at the Royal Academy in London.Westmorland Gazette: 'The Amazon Chaplaincy', November 6, 1926  A chaplain in South America  In 1907 Miles-Moss became chaplin of Lima, Peru. He visited Par√°, Brazil for the first time in 1911 at the wish of Bishop Every, Anglican Bishop for Eastern South America, returning in 1912 to build the small Par√° Anglican Church in Belem seating 150 at a cost of around ¬£1,000. Miles-Moss was to be responsible for the whole Amazon basin, a district stretching from Peru to the Atlantic including from Iquitos to Cear√° and from Man√°os to Porto Velho. This area was 3,000 miles from east to west by 800 across which he estimated to be about 1/24th of the world's land mass. In 1945 he returned home to Liverpool to seek treatment for his arthritis. He died in 1948 in Kendal.  Lepidoptera collections  Miles-Moss was a keen naturalist and already in his teens he was corresponding with butterfly collecting grandees such as the Rothschild family. After just 3 years in Peru he had published a guide to Peruvian butterflies which earned a complimentary letter from the president of Peru.BBC: 'The Vicar of the Amazon' by Martin Wainwright, transmitted 3 September 1987 In Brazil he took particular interest in the early stages of insects. While travelling around his parish he was able to combine his ministry with continuing his research. He was fortunate to have rich backers who financed his lepidoptera research, especially the second Lord Rothschild, who was building up the greatest collection of butterflies and moths ever made in his collection at Tring Museum, Hertfordshire (he collected 2 million butterflies and mothsNatural History Museum at Tring http://www.nhm.ac.uk/tring/history-collections/history-of-the- collections/index.html). Rothschild's Tring collection was eventually taken over by the Natural History Museum. Miles-Moss' lepidoptera specimens are still considered a valuable resource today and 25,000 Brazilian lepidoptera are stored in the Natural History Museum at Tring. Due to his accurate artwork and precision, Miles-Moss' collection of lepidoptera drawings and notes are so important they are maintained in a separate collection at the Natural History Museum today. Miles-Moss was visited in Brazil by the lepidopterist, traveller and diarist Margaret Fountaine, who described himCater, W.F. ed., 1986 Butterflies and Late Loves.

The main purpose of Open vSwitch is to provide a switching stack for hardware virtualization environments, while supporting multiple protocols and standards used in computer networks. The project's source code is distributed under the terms of Apache License 2.0.  Overview  server virtual network switch, transparently distributed across multiple physical servers. Open vSwitch is a software implementation of a virtual multilayer network switch, designed to enable effective network automation through programmatic extensions, while supporting standard management interfaces and protocols such as NetFlow, sFlow, SPAN, RSPAN, CLI, LACP and 802.1ag. In addition, Open vSwitch is designed to support transparent distribution across multiple physical servers by enabling creation of cross- server switches in a way that abstracts out the underlying server architecture, similar to the VMware vNetwork distributed vswitch or Cisco Nexus 1000V. Open vSwitch can operate both as a software-based network switch running within a virtual machine (VM) hypervisor, and as the control stack for dedicated switching hardware; as a result, it has been ported to multiple virtualization platforms, switching chipsets, and networking hardware accelerators. Open vSwitch is the default network switch in the XenServer virtualization platform since its version 6.0, and in the Xen Cloud Platform via its XAPI management toolstack. It also supports Xen, Linux KVM, Proxmox VE and VirtualBox hypervisors, while a port to Hyper-V is also available. Open vSwitch has also been integrated into various cloud computing software platforms and virtualization management systems, including OpenStack, openQRM, OpenNebula and oVirt. The Linux kernel implementation of Open vSwitch was merged into the kernel mainline in kernel version 3.3, which was released on March 18, 2012; official Linux packages are available for Debian, Fedora, openSUSE and Ubuntu. , FreeBSD and NetBSD implementations are also available, with the NetBSD's implementation operating completely in userspace.

The premiere of the film was watched by 3.2 million viewers. Plot In 1914, the luckiest man in town Tommy Murphy (Burkely Duffield) is overjoyed when the girl of his dreams, Caitlin O'Leary (Andrea Brooks), agrees to dance with him in the town festival despite all rumors that she is a witch (known as a young gypsy woman). The event is ruined when a young woman named Violet (Jessa Danielson) surprises him by showing her feelings for Tommy by kissing him in front of his date. Tommy tries to keep Caitlin from running off, only for him to accidentally tear her dress and humiliate her by revealing her underwear. This proves to be too much for Caitlin to take, and being a witch, she curses Tommy and all of his descendants with incredibly bad luck. He tries to find her so they could reconcile and reverse the curse, but is heartbroken when he learns that she married someone else. One hundred years later, his great-great-granddaughter Meg Murphy (Ciara Bravo) is desperate to end the family's curse. Together with her brother Charlie (Jacob Bertrand), Meg finds Tommy's diary and finds out that to get rid of the curse she needs to give Tommy's \\"lucky coin\\" to a descendant of Caitlin. They successfully manage to steal their great-great- grandfather Tommy's lucky coin from the Harvest Hills Historical Museum. Afterward, Meg realizes that Ivy Murray (Elena Kampouris), a mean girl at school that picks on her, is a descendant of the O'Leary family and decides to give her the coin; her crush, Brett (Jack Griffo), asks her to the festival and she realizes that he's a descendant of Caitlin as well (being Ivy's cousin). At the dance she gives him the lucky coin, hoping to break her curse; however, a piece of Tommy's diary winds up in Charlie's hands and reading it, Charlie realizes the coin just ends up transferring the curse to Brett's family. Meg is horrified when she discovers what has happened and arrives at his house to witness his house getting ransacked by an angry monkey. Ivy answers the door, and upon learning that the bad luck came from Meg giving Brett the coin, she grows angry. Meg manages to convince Ivy that she never intended for this to happen and Ivy realizes she's always been mean to Meg since her cursed accidents affected her as well but realizes that it's not Meg's fault. The two race to the closing ceremony, where Brett gives Meg the coin back. She then almost falls off a flag tower but is saved by Brett, who then kisses her. Afterwards, Meg and Ivy become best friends and she and Brett are dating. Meg goes to science camp after all and accidentally invents a potion that grows hair on bald heads. Meg realizes that her curse is what makes her special. She puts back Tommy's diary with the coin after reading in the last part that Tommy, due to his bad luck, meets his beautiful wife at the hospital and throws his coin into the fountain causing a flood. Even so, he believes that it's the attitude that counts. Meg and her family go on vacation to visit the Grand Canyon and end up causing more bad luck, with Ivy and Brett running for their lives, but laughing about it.

The Restoration of Peter (also known as the Re-commissioning of Peter)Paul Barnett, John: The Shepherd King (Sydney South: Aquila Press, 2005), p. 314. is an incident described in John 21 of the New Testament in which Jesus appeared to his disciples after his resurrection, and spoke to Peter in particular. Jesus restored Peter to fellowship after Peter had previously denied him, and told Peter to feed Jesus' sheep. Background =Jesus' resurrection= Jesus rose from the dead and appeared to his disciples. The Gospel of John records a number of such appearances. This episode is thus part of the fourth resurrection appearance in John's gospel. =Peter's denial= All four gospels record Peter's denial of Jesus, and all of the synoptic gospels record how Peter \\"wept bitterly\\" after the rooster crowed. John omits this detail, but he is unique in describing the restoration scene between Jesus and Peter. Jesus words in Mark 16:7, however, are often thought to carry the message of Peter's restoration: \\"But go, tell his disciples and Peter, ‚ÄòHe is going ahead of you into Galilee...‚Äô\\" (NIV).William L. Lane, The Gospel According to Mark (NICNT; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1971), p. 589. William de Brailes, Christ Appears at Lake Tiberias, c. 1250. Paul Barnett notes that Jesus' approach to Peter in John 21 is \\"both forgiving and stern.\\"Paul Barnett, John, p. 321. =Meeting by the sea= In John 21, Peter goes fishing with six other disciples. They do not catch any fish all night, but in the morning Jesus meets them, and tells them to throw their net on the other side of the boat. When they do, there is a miraculous catch of 153 fish. Jesus and his disciples have breakfast on the shore. Jesus prepares the breakfast, including a charcoal fire. Peter also stood near a charcoal fire when he denied Jesus. The charcoal fire (Greek: ·ºÄŒΩŒ∏œÅŒ±Œ∫Œπ√°, anthrakia) is found only twice in the New Testament (John 18:18; 21:9) and becomes a verbal thread that links the two climactic events of Peter‚Äôs life.James L. Resseguie, \\"A Glossary of New Testament Narrative Criticism with Illustrations,\\" in Religions, 10 (3: 217), 33. After they finish eating, Jesus speaks particularly to Peter. Jesus' three-fold charge to Peter =Comparison with Peter's denial= Earlier Peter had denied Jesus three times. Now, in response to Jesus' questioning, Peter affirms his love for Jesus three times. William Hendriksen notes some other correspondences between this episode and that of Peter's denial. For example, it is at a charcoal (·ºÄŒΩŒ∏œÅŒ±Œ∫Œπ·Ω∞ŒΩ) fire where Peter first denied Jesus (John 18:18), and now is asked to confess his love for his master (John 21:9).William Hendriksen (London: Banner of Truth, 1961), The Gospel of John, p. 486. Ben Witherington III suggests that \\"John has the threefold restoration take place in a setting similar to where the threefold denial did. It's like revisiting the scene of the crime, only this time getting it right.\\"Ben Witherington III, What Have They Done with Jesus? Beyond Strange Theories and Bad History ‚Äì Why We Can Trust the Bible (New York: HarperOne, 2006), p. 73. =\\"Do you love me more than these?\\"= Jesus asks Peter, \\"Do you love me more than these?\\" The Greek text is ambiguous as to what the \\"these\\" refers to, and D. A. Carson notes that there are three possibilities: #Do you love me more than you love these disciples? #Do you love me more than you love this fishing gear? #Do you love me more than these other disciples do? Carson himself chooses the third option.D. A. Carson, The Gospel According to John (Leicester: Apollos, 1991), pp. 675‚Äì676. Adrienne von Speyr argues, \\"The Lord expects that Peter should love him more than the others do, more than John, who is nevertheless love personified. And he should also have personal knowledge of this more. This expectation constitutes an immediate overtaxing of Peter, an overtaxing that begins here and will reach no end until the end of time. ... More than these also means: more than these who have previously known only personal love.\\" =Two words used for \\"love\\"= The dialogue between Jesus and Peter contains two different words for \\"love\\", which some, but not all, commentators deem to be of exegetical significance. The words are agapa√¥ (the verb form of the noun agape) and phile√¥ (the verb form of the noun philia). The dialogue proceeds as follows: *Jesus asked, \\"do you agap√¢is me?\\" *Peter replied, \\"I phile√¥ you.\\" *Jesus asked, \\"do you agap√¢is me?\\" *Peter replied, \\"I phile√¥ you.\\" *Jesus asked, \\"do you phileis me?\\" *Peter replied, \\"I phile√¥ you.\\" Peter Paul Rubens, Christ's Charge to Peter, c. 1616 This is brought out in the 1984 (but not the 2011) edition of the NIV, which renders agapao as \\"truly love\\" and phileo as \\"love\\". Ben Witherington III suggests that this indicates \\"Jesus' gracious condescension to the level that Peter was prepared to respond at this juncture.\\"Ben Witherington III, What Have They Done with Jesus?, p. 74. William Hendriksen argues that in his third question, Jesus is calling into question even Peter's \\"subjective attachment\\" and affection, and that is why it says \\"Peter was grieved because he said to him this third time...\\" (John 21:17).William Hendriksen, John, p. 488. Other commentators, such as Carson, reject the idea of a distinction between the meaning of the two words.D. A. Carson, John, p. 676-677. According to Thomas J. Lane, \\"Since the early centuries, it has been debated whether there is significance to Peter responding with a different love verb and for the third question Jesus using the same love verb as Peter. While the majority opinion has swayed to and fro over the centuries, the common opinion now is that, since these two love verbs are used interchangeably in this Gospel, there is no special significance to their use here in [John] 21:15-17. Keener has done a study of their interchangeability in John, showing that they are both used even to describe the Father loving Jesus.\\" In his The Lord, Romano Guardini says that Jesus' second and third questions made Peter nevermore answers him with his \\"old confidence\\", made him more humble and realized that he was being punished for \\"his triple treason\\". =Peter appointed as shepherd= In response to Peter's three affirmations of love for him, Jesus gives Peter three commands: \\"Feed my lambs\\" / \\"Take care of my sheep\\" / \\"Feed my sheep\\". Jesus is re-commissioning Peter as an apostle and leader in the church. \\"Sheep\\" is a common metaphor in the New Testament to refer to the people of God. This is the origin of the word \\"pastor\\", which means \\"shepherd\\". The 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia argues that the title \\"Vicar of Christ\\", given to the Pope, is founded on these words of Jesus, \\"by which He constituted the Prince of the Apostles guardian of His entire flock in His own place, thus making him His Vicar and fulfilling the promise made in Matthew 16:18‚Äì19.\\" Protestant theologians such as D. A. Carson argues that \\"neither founding pre-eminence nor comparative authority is in view\\" in this passage.D. A. Carson, John, 678. Writing from an Orthodox perspective, Victor Potapov argues that the word \\"feed\\" does not signify \\"the supreme authority of pastorship,\\" but simply \\"the authority and responsibilities of pastorship proper to all the apostles and their successors.\\" Jesus' prediction of Peter's death Jesus then describes Peter's future to him, and says \\"someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go\\" (John 21:18, NIV). The narrator interprets this as referring to Peter's martyrdom (John 21:19). According to a tradition found in the apocryphal Acts of Peter, Peter was crucified upside-down. \\"Follow me\\" After having said all the above, Jesus said to Peter, \\"Follow me\\" (John 21:19). Romano Guardini argues, \\"Here too an event from the past is recalled, transfigured, and continued.\\" At the moment Peter became happy again since he realized that he has been forgiven, and then he resumed \\"something of his old garrulousness\\".

Background information Max Stern was a world-renowned art collector and gallery owner who died in 1987. During World War II, Stern was forced to flee the Nazi regime and relocate to Canada. While escaping, he lost his private collection of valued artworks through forced sale and confiscation. After the war, Stern sought restitution of these works. Unfortunately, he had limited success and only managed to recover several pieces. The majority of his property was never returned. The project The Max Stern Art Restitution Project was established by the executors and university beneficiaries of the Max Stern Estate. An official announcement outlining the initiation of the project and its goals was made on April 28, 2005. This announcement occurred in Quebec, and was given by Dr. Clarence Epstein of Concordia University. The project is seeking the restitution of art pieces originally owned by the late Max Stern. These pieces were either confiscated by the Nazi Party, or sold under duress in the 1930s. While project members realize that locating missing artwork is a great challenge, they decided that the moral and financial imperatives surrounding the cause make it worth the effort. Concordia University has been a leader in the restitution movement, and is working closely with the Art Loss Register in London, the Commission of Looted Art in Europe, and the New York State Holocaust Claims Processing Office. Since Concordia launched its efforts, 250 artworks previously owned by Stern have been identified. These include pieces by Brueghel, Bosch, Carracci and Winterhalter. Five works have been located in the United States, England, the Netherlands or Germany. As artworks are reclaimed and possession is acquired, estate executors plan to loan the pieces to museums and galleries. This decision was made based on Max Stern's ideals, as he was always encouraging art education and passion in Canada and around the world. Executors and beneficiaries have expressed their wish to avoid using the courts, and instead wish to utilize moral persuasion in convincing institutions and individuals to return works to the appropriate beneficiaries. The Max Stern Art Restitution Project was not initiated only to find missing works. Rather, it was also created as an incentive to motivate governments, museums, collectors and the art trade towards resolving injustices caused by Nazi cultural policies. In order to commence this movement, the restitution project chose to spearhead the Auktion 392 exhibit. Auktion 392 Launched in fall of 2006, Auktion 392 is a traveling exhibit surrounding the forced sale of Stern paintings in the Lempertz auction house during 1937. This exhibit was created by FOFA gallery coordinator Lynn Beavis and designer Andrew Elvish. It also accompanies the seminal research of Professor Catherine MacKenzie and MA students from Concordia's Department of Art History. The exhibition outlines the unique story of Max Stern, and the legal issues of art restitution stemming from anti-Semitic policies during World War II. There is historical meaning behind the name of this exhibit. In 1935, after Stern had his art trading license withdrawn, he was forced to sell his artworks under extreme duress. The sale was arranged by Lempertz auctioneers in Cologne, and the auction was titled Auktion 392. This exhibit is extremely valuable to the Max Stern Art Restitution Project, as it raises public awareness of art restitution matters. Issues in restitution Recovering the missing artwork has been no simple task. There have been several instances where pieces have been located, but a lack of cooperation keeps the works from being acquired. Take, for example, the issue surrounding two artworks originally sold under duress by Stern. The two paintings, Market Scene in the Piazza Navona and Market Scene in the Piazza del Quirinale, were created by a Dutch Baroque painter named Mathijs Naiveu. These paintings were discovered while being auctioned in the Van Ham auction house, which is located in Cologne. On November 8, 2006, it was requested that the artworks be removed from the upcoming auction. The Stern Estate had been pursuing the paintings for several years, ever since the possessor tried to sell them in Amsterdam. Unfortunately, the German possessor refused to acknowledge the forced sale that took place during the Nazi era. Consequently, the Van Ham sale was scheduled to proceed despite the tainted history. In order to be reclaimed, each discovered artwork has to run through a legal process which varies depending on its located country. Some pieces present extreme challenges, like the Neufchatel portrait of Jan van Eversdijck. Upon discovery, this portrait was deemed part of the patrimony of the Illes Beleares province in Spain. This patrimony made difficult for project members to claim their right of ownership. Fortunately, the painting has since been restituted and is one of the 11 paintings reclaimed by the Max Stern Art Restitution Project. This particular portrait was easy to locate because it was posted on a museum website up until 2006. Other paintings are much more difficult to find. This difficulty stems from the fact that a large number of Stern's stock was not illustrated, and few of the given titles were likely to have remained over the years. Unfortunately, art galleries and auction houses are not required to provide background information on works of art in their possession. Dealers will often be in possession of the full story behind a specific painting, but choose to suppress this information for business reasons. Research conducted has learned that upwards of forty paintings originally owned by Stern have since been re-offered on the market in the last two decades, usually through major auction houses in Germany. The Stern Estate continues to plead with German auction houses, hoping to make them recognize the validity of the estate's ownership regarding looted artworks. Works recovered by the project While facing a lot of difficulty in their endeavor to locate the missing Stern paintings, the Max Stern Art Restitution Project has also been presented with countless victories. To date, they have managed to recover the following works: *Scandinavian Landscape by Andreas Achanbach ‚Äì Restituted October 2013 *Virgin and Child by Master of Flemalle ‚Äì Restituted March 2013 *The Masters of the Goldsmith Guild in Amsterdam in 1701 by Juriaen Pool II ‚Äì Restituted October 2011 *Allegory of Earth and Water by Jan Brueghel the Younger ‚Äì Restituted November 2010 *St. Jerome by Lodovico Carracci ‚Äì Restituted May 2009 *Portrait of a Musician Playing a Bagpipe, 1632 by Northern Netherlandish School ‚Äì Restituted April 2009 *Flight into Egypt by Circle of Jan Wellens de Cock ‚Äì Restituted December 2008 *Girl from the Sabine Mountains by Franz Xaver Winterhalter ‚Äì Restituted January 2008 *Extensive Landscape with Travelers on a Track Near a Walled Town with a Castle and a Church, a Village Beyond by Jan de Vos I ‚Äì Restituted December 2007 *Portrait of Jan van Eversdyck by Nicolas Neufchatel ‚Äì Restituted February 2007 *Aim√©e, A Young Egyptian by Emile C.H.

He was engaged in a long-running dispute over jurisdiction with Enrico Dandolo, the Patriarch of Grado. Biography Giovanni Polani was a kinsman of the Doge of Venice, Pietro Polani (r. 1130‚Äì1148). He became bishop of Castello in 1133. In this position Polani had direct jurisdiction over the parishes of Venice. Polani supported reform. In 1138 he gave the San Danielle parish church to Manfredo, a Cistercian from Fruttuaria abbey in San Benigno Canavese in Piedmont, so he could build a monastery. The monks established their monastery near the Cathedral of San Pietro di Castello, and the income from the church helped support it. The monks agreed to respect and pay tithes to the diocese. Polani became engaged in a dispute with Enrico Dandolo, the Patriarch of Grado. Eventually these clashes, which also involved the Doge, would culminate in the exile of the patriarch. In 1139, encouraged by Dandolo, the clergy of the ancient church of San Salvatore in central Venice decided to become canons regular under the rule of St. Augustine. The diocese had less control over such semi-monastic communities, some of which were directly linked to Rome. The clergy failed to confirm their subordination to the diocese. Polani was furious at what he saw as an attempt to take this important parish away from his control, and placed it under interdict. In response, Dandolo placed it under his metropolitan protection. On 13 May 1141 Pope Innocent II lifted the interdict, placed San Salvatore under his personal protection and sent two canons to instruct the congregation in the rule. In 1141 Dandolo placed and blessed the foundation stone of the complex holding a church and hostel for pilgrims on the Isola di San Clemente. The island was given to canons regular. Dandolo expected it would come under the patriarchate of Grado, and this became a long-running cause of dispute with Polani. Eventually, in 1156 Polani was forced by the Pope to relinquish all claims against the church of San Clemente. He died in 1164.

Background  It is not known when Cui Xie was born. He came from the prominent aristocratic Cui clan of Qinghe, from which many officials came throughout Tang Dynasty. His grandfather Cui Guan (Â¥îÁìò) served as the minister of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Libu Shangshu), while his father Cui Yanrong (Â¥îÂΩ•Ëûç) served as the prefect of Chu Prefecture (Ê•öÂ∑û, in modern Huai'an, Jiangsu) ‚Äî but no higher, having had his career derailed by the more senior official Cui Rao (Â¥îËïò), who exposed him for bribing high-level officials. Through the rest of his life, therefore, Cui Yanrong bore a deep hatred for Cui Rao and indoctrinated his sons to hate Cui Rao as well. Cui Xie himself was known for filial piety in his youth. At some point, he passed the imperial examinations in the Jinshi class, and started his official career as a surveyor for the director of the treasury, as well as the sheriff of Weinan County (Ê∏≠Âçó, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi) and served as an editor for imperial histories.History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 58.  During Later Liang  After Tang ended and was replaced by (in its central part) Later Liang, Cui Xie served in the posts (unclear whether simultaneously, but appeared to be simultaneously) of Zuosi Langzhong (Â∑¶Âè∏ÈÉé‰∏≠, a supervisory official serving under one of the secretaries generals of the Executive Bureau of government (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng)), the magistrate of Wannian County (Ëê¨Âπ¥, one of the two counties making up the Tang capital Chang'an but no longer capital during Later Liang times), and imperial attendant (Áµ¶‰∫ã‰∏≠, Jishizhong). After promotions, he eventually reached the post of deputy minister of defense (ÂÖµÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Bingbu Shilang). However, he once had an encounter with Cui Rao's son Cui Jujian (Â¥îÂ±ÖÂÑâ), who was then serving as Zhongshu Sheren (‰∏≠Êõ∏Ëàç‰∫∫), a comparably-leveled official at the legislative bureau (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng). He yelled out to Cui Jujian in a harsh tone, \\"How dare you see me, the son of Cui Rao?\\" When Cui Jujian reported this (apparently to the emperor, although it is not known who was the emperor at that time), Cui Xie was demoted to be the head of the Crown Prince's household ‚Äî a completely honorary position, as there was never a prince who was crowned the Crown Prince during Later Liang. However, shortly after, he was restored to his prior rank, as deputy minister of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Libu Shilang).  During Later Tang  After Later Liang was in turn conquered by its northern rival Later Tang, Cui Xie became deputy chief imperial censor (Âæ°Âè≤‰∏≠‰∏û, Yushi Zhongcheng) in the new administration of Later Tang's first emperor Li Cunxu. However, in his reports, he would often make grammatical or diction errors, and therefore was often called out and punished for it. He was also said to be impressive in appearance and capable of speech, but having logical lapses in his arguments, such that he gained a reputation for having style without substance. Early in the subsequent administration of Li Cunxu's adoptive brother and successor Li Siyuan, Cui served successively as the minister of rites (Á¶ÆÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Libu Shangshu) and then as the minister of worship (Â§™Â∏∏Âçø, Taichang Qing). In 927, after Li Siyuan had removed two chancellors left over from Li Cunxu's administration, Doulu Ge and Wei Shuo, he was considering who else to commission as chancellors to replace Doulu and Wei. One of his chiefs of staff, Kong Xun, did not like having chancellors from north of the Yellow River ‚Äî i.e., from the territory of Later Tang's predecessor state Jin ‚Äî and thus recommended Cui. The chancellor Ren Huan recommended Li Qi, but fellow chancellor Zheng Jue disliked Li Qi, and therefore persuaded Kong's chief of staff colleague An Chonghui ‚Äî who was then the most powerful official at Li Siyuan's court and with whom Kong was closely aligned ‚Äî that Li Qi was corrupt and unsuitable. An therefore recommended Cui as well when they discussed the matter before the emperor. Upon hearing An's recommendation, Ren responded:Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 275. Li Siyuan himself suggested that the imperial scholar Feng Dao might be suitable, and then ordered these officials to rediscuss the matter. This drew Kong's displeasure about how Ren interfered with his recommendation, and he became even more determined to have Cui made chancellor. When An subsequently discussed the matter with Ren again, Ren compared choosing Cui over Li Qi to choosing beetle dung over fragrant styrax balls. Still, with Kong making daily compliments of Cui and attacks against Li Qi, eventually, Cui and Feng were made chancellors with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã), and Li Qi was not. It was said that Cui Xie did not handle much of the important matters of state as chancellor, and that whenever he had to author important documents, he had others write them for him. At that time, it was felt that the imperial university was being neglected, and Li Siyuan therefore had Cui take on the additional responsibility as the principal of the imperial university. He subsequently proposed that 200 students be admitted each year, a proposal that was considered by the popular opinion at the time to be inadequate. In early 929, Li Siyuan was returning from the eastern capital Daliang to then-capital Luoyang, with the imperial officials attending him on the trek. While on the way, Cui Xie died at Xushui (È†àÊ∞¥, in modern Zhengzhou, Henan), due to a stroke. He was given posthumous honors, and the posthumous name Gongjing (ÊÅ≠Èùñ, \\"respectful and meek\\").

Set tens of thousands of years in the future, the saga chronicles a civilization which has banned computers but has also developed advanced technology and mental and physical abilities through physical training, eugenics and the use of the drug melange. Specialized groups of individuals have aligned themselves in organizations focusing on specific abilities, technology and goals. Herbert's concepts of human evolution and technology have been analyzed and deconstructed in at least one book, The Science of Dune (2008). His originating 1965 novel Dune is popularly considered one of the greatest science fiction novels of all time,Touponce, William F. (1988), Frank Herbert, Boston, Massachusetts: Twayne Publishers imprint, G. K. Hall & Co, pg. 119, . \\"Locus ran a poll of readers on April 15, 1975 in which Dune 'was voted the all-time best science-fiction novel...It has sold over ten million copies in numerous editions.'\\" and is frequently cited as the best-selling science fiction novel in history. Dune and its five sequels by Herbert explore the complex and multilayered interactions of politics, religion, ecology and technology, among other themes. As Frank Herbert's Dune (1965) begins, the known universe is ruled by Shaddam IV, the 81st Padishah Emperor of House Corrino, whose power is secured by his control of the brutally efficient military force known as the Imperial Sardaukar. One balance to Imperial power is the assembly of noble houses called the Landsraad, which enforces the Great Convention's ban on the use of atomics against human targets. Though the power of the Corrinos is unrivaled by any individual House, they are in constant competition with each other for political power and stakes in the omnipresent CHOAM company, a directorship which controls the wealth of the entire Old Empire. The third primary power in the universe is the Spacing Guild, which monopolizes interstellar travel and banking through its proprietary use of melange-mutated Guild Navigators perform the necessary computations to safely \\"fold space.\\" The matriarchal Bene Gesserit possess almost superhuman physical, sensory, and deductive powers developed through years of physical and mental conditioning. While positioning themselves to \\"serve\\" mankind, the Bene Gesserit pursue their goal to better the human race by subtly and secretly guiding and manipulating human bloodlines and the affairs of others to serve their own purposes. \\"Human computers\\" known as Mentats have been developed and perfected to replace the capacity for logical analysis lost through the prohibition of computers. The patriarchal Bene Tleilax, or Tleilaxu, are amoral merchants who traffic in biological and genetically engineered products such as artificial eyes, \\"twisted\\" Mentats and a type of clone called a ghola. Finally, the Ixians produce cutting-edge technology that seemingly complies with (but sometimes pushes the boundaries of) the prohibitions against computers, thinking machines and conscious robots put in place 10,000 years before as a result of the Butlerian Jihad. The doctors of the Suk School are the universe's most competent and trusted; those who have received the \\"Suk Imperial Conditioning\\" are incapable of inflicting harm. The Swordmasters of Ginaz are an elite group of master swordsmen whose fighting skills are prized and unmatched. Equally fierce in battle are the native Fremen of the desert planet Arrakis, known as Dune. Naturally honed to excellence in harsh conditions rivaling the planet on which the Imperial Sardaukar are trained, the Fremen are misunderstood and underestimated by the other powers in the universe. Arrakis is the only natural source of the all-important spice melange, and by leading the Fremen to seize control of the planet in Dune, Paul Atreides is able to depose Shaddam and become ruler of the known universe. With a bloody jihad subsequently unleashed across the universe in Paul's name but out of his control, the Bene Gesserit, Tleilaxu, Spacing Guild and House Corrino plot to dethrone him in Dune Messiah (1969). Seeing the eventual extinction of mankind through prescient vision, in Children of Dune (1976) Paul's son Leto II devises a plan to save humanity but becomes a symbiote with the sandworm of Arrakis to gain the extended lifespan needed to see this plan to its end. Thirty-five hundred years later in God Emperor of Dune (1981), Leto still rules the universe as a benevolent tyrant, with the help of his all-female army, the Fish Speakers. He denies any spiritual outlets other than his own compulsory religion, and maintains a tight monopoly on melange and space travel. Through his own selective breeding program among the descendants of his twin sister Ghanima, Leto finally achieves Siona, whose actions are hidden from prescient vision. He engineers his own assassination, knowing it will result in rebellion and revolt but also in an explosion in travel and colonization. The resultant chaos and severe famine on many worlds cause trillions of humans to set off into the freedom of unknown space and spread out across the universe in a diaspora later called the Scattering. Fifteen hundred years later, as Heretics of Dune (1984) begins, the balance of power in the Empire rests among the Ixians, the Bene Gesserit and the Tleilaxu. The Spacing Guild has been forever weakened by the development of Ixian machines capable of navigation in foldspace, practically replacing Guild Navigators. Ixians are at their apex with their alliance with the Fish Speakers; but Bene Gesserit analysts see them as a failing power, because Ixian society has become a bureaucracy and no great inventions have come out of the workshops of Ix for centuries. The Bene Gesserit control the sandworms and their planet, now called Rakis, through their influence over the Rakian Priesthood that worships the sandworms as the Divided God, Leto II, and now actively participate on interstellar politics and even have their own standing armies. But the Tleilaxu have also discovered how to synthetically produce melange, and they are preparing to subjugate the rest of humanity. As a large influx of people begin to return from the Scattering, the Bene Gesserit find their match in a violent and corrupt matriarchal society known as the Honored Matres. A bitter and bloody war erupts between the orders, but in Chapterhouse: Dune (1985) it ultimately becomes clear that joining the two organizations into a single New Sisterhood with shared abilities is their best chance at survival against the approaching enemy who had driven the Honored Matres into the Old Empire. Bene Gesserit The Bene Gesserit are a key social, religious, and political force in Frank Herbert's science fiction Dune universe. The matriarchal group is described as a secretive and exclusive sisterhood whose members train their bodies and minds through years of physical and mental conditioning to obtain superhuman powers and abilities that can seem magical to outsiders. Under the guise of humbly \\"serving\\" the Empire, the Sisterhood is in fact a major power in the universe, using its many areas of influence to subtly guide mankind along the path of their own plan for humanity's future. The Bene Gesserit also have a secret, millennia-long selective breeding program to bolster and preserve valuable skills and bloodlines as well as to produce a theoretical superhuman male they call the Kwisatz Haderach. Bene Tleilax The Bene Tleilax (or Tleilaxu) are an extremely xenophobic and isolationist society in the Dune universe. Genetic manipulators who traffic in biological products such as artificial eyes, gholas, and \\"twisted\\" Mentats, the Tleilaxu are a major power in the Imperium. The race is ruled by a small council of Tleilaxu Masters, whose genetically-engineered Face Dancer servants have the ability to mimic any human. The Masters themselves possess a bland and diminutive appearance intended to compel other races to underestimate them. In Heretics of Dune (1984) it is revealed that they are a secret totalitarian theocracy ultimately seeking domination of the known universe. Despite their influence, the Bene Tleilax are universally distrusted and inspire disgust because their products, though desirable, push the limits of the moral proscriptions established by the ancient Butlerian Jihad. CHOAM The flag of CHOAM, as described in Dune (1965) The Combine Honnete Ober Advancer Mercantiles (CHOAM) is a universal development corporation in Frank Herbert's science fiction Dune universe, first mentioned in the 1965 novel Dune. CHOAM controls all economic affairs across the cosmos, though it is still at the mercy of the Spacing Guild's monopoly on interstellar travel. In a 1980 article, Herbert equated CHOAM with OPEC, the real-world intergovernmental organization which is a major power in the petroleum industry. He writes in Dune: CHOAM's management and board of directors are controlled by the Padishah Emperor and the assembly of noble Houses known as the Landsraad (with the Spacing Guild and the Bene Gesserit as silent partners). Because of its control of interplanetary commerce, CHOAM is the largest single source of wealth in the Old Empire; as such, influence in CHOAM is a central goal of political maneuvering. In Dune, Herbert notes: Before the climactic battle in Dune, Paul Atreides and the Fremen watch the Padishah Emperor's encampment to see whether he will raise the Atreides flag, indicating a recognition of Paul's claims, or the banner of Paul's Harkonnen enemies. Instead, the Emperor raises the flag of CHOAM, as a reminder to all of the combatant parties that economics trump political considerations. In 2011, Forbes ranked CHOAM as the largest fictional corporation. ;Prequels In the Great Schools of Dune novels that take place eight decades after the end of the Butlerian Jihad, Josef Venport, the director of Venport Holdings (Venhold), the largest foldspace transportation company in the universe and the only company utilizing Navigators, forms Combined Mercantiles to mine spice on Arrakis. While ostensibly an independent company, it's an open secret that Combined Mercantiles works for Venhold. Presumably, the company eventually evolves into CHOAM. Fish Speakers The Fish Speakers are the all-female army of the God Emperor Leto II Atreides in Frank Herbert's science fiction Dune universe, featured primarily in God Emperor of Dune (1981). Named so because \\"the first priestesses spoke to fish in their dreams,\\" the organization is founded by Leto after the events of Children of Dune (1976). In Dune (1965), Leto II's father Paul Atreides overthrows Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV when Paul's fierce Fremen army manages to defeat Shaddam's previously-unstoppable Sardaukar forces. Though the religiously loyal Fremen and the remnants of the Sardaukar are later at Leto's disposal, Leto (possessing the life experiences of his ancestors over millennia through Other Memory) has come to believe that male-dominated military organizations are essentially predatory and will turn on the civilian population in the absence of an external enemy. Ruling for 3,500 years as a human-sandworm symbiote, Leto molds his Fish Speaker army into both a military and religious force that also functions as the bureaucracy for his tyrannical empire. As Leto sees his Golden Path for humanity's survival from extinction coming to fruition, he allows himself to be assassinated at the end of God Emperor of Dune (1981). Control of the Fish Speakers passes to Duncan Idaho and Siona Atreides. By the time of Heretics of Dune (1984), the influence of the Fish Speakers has significantly waned in comparison to the Bene Gesserit, Bene Tleilax, and Ixians, the latter two now having great control over the Fish Speakers. By then, the Fish Speakers have also incorporated men into their ranks, and have little in common with the force maintained by Leto II in terms of philosophy or practices. Also by this time, many of the leaders of the Fish Speakers have been replaced with Tleilaxu Face Dancers, essentially making the Fish Speakers, and the realms under their domain, puppets of the Tleilaxu. In Chapterhouse: Dune (1985), the unlocking of Murbella's Other Memory confirms the Bene Gesserit's suspicions that the violent Honored Matres are descendants of Fish Speakers who had fled into The Scattering following Leto's death. Fremen The Fremen are a secretive and misunderstood tribe of humans in the Dune universe. As the native population of the desert planet Arrakis, when Dune (1965) begins they have been long overlooked by the rest of the Imperium and considered backward savages; in reality they are an extremely hardy people and exist in large numbers, their culture built around the commodity of water, which is extremely scarce on Arrakis. Honored Matres The Honored Matres are a matriarchal organization in the Dune universe, described as an aggressive cult obsessed with power, violence, and sexual domination. They are introduced in Frank Herbert's Heretics of Dune (1984) as new and bitter enemies of the Bene Gesserit. Ixians The Ixians are a technological culture in the Dune universe who provide both simple and sophisticated mechanical devices to the rest of the Imperium. Though Ixian technology is commonplace and considered essential, it sometimes tests the limits of the anti-technology proscriptions established in the aftermath of the Butlerian Jihad. Landsraad The Landsraad is a political body in Frank Herbert's science fiction Dune universe. As established in Herbert's 1965 novel Dune, it is the assembly of all noble Houses in the Imperium, and plays a very important role in the political and economic power balance of the Empire, which is shared among the Landsraad, the Padishah Emperor, and the Spacing Guild (the Bene Gesserit prefer clandestine manipulation to overt action and therefore remain a \\"silent\\" fourth power in the Empire until the fall of Leto II Atreides). The Emperor's power derives from Imperial control of the seemingly invincible military forces of the Sardaukar, and of the planet Arrakis and its priceless melange, a source of endless wealth. The Landsraad represents the unification of all the other ruling families, known as Houses, to create a check against the individual power of the Emperor, a theoretically comparable force. Both the combined Houses and the Emperor are in turn dependent on the Guild for interstellar travel. This delicate balance of power initially serves to prevent any particularly ambitious or destructive faction or individual from upsetting the stability of society. In \\"Terminology of the Imperium,\\" the glossary of Dune (1965), Herbert specifies a House as a \\"Ruling Clan of a planet or planetary system,\\" with major Houses holding planetary fiefs and being interplanetary entrepreneurs, and minor Houses being planet- bound. Individual Houses are in constant competition for fiefdoms, financial and political power, and Imperial favor. The High Council is the inner circle of the Landsraad during the time of the Faufreluches, \\"the rigid rule of class distinction enforced by the Imperium.\\" The Council is \\"empowered to act as supreme tribunal in House to House disputes.\\" A grievance is brought before the High Council in a Bill of Particulars. Shortly after the assassination of his father Duke Leto Atreides and the Harkonnen/Corrino invasion of the planet Arrakis in Dune, Paul Atreides expresses a desire to put forward a Bill of Particulars to the Landsraad High Council to express his grievance and point out the laws that had been broken by this invasion. Paul believes that his grievance would be supported because the Great Houses would never endorse the Sardaukar eliminating them one-by-one (which is, of course, one of the principal reasons why the Landsraad exists to begin with). The Judge of the Change is \\"an official appointed by the Landsraad High Council and the Emperor to monitor a change of fief, a kanly negotiation, or formal battle in a War of Assassins. The Judge's arbitral authority may be challenged only before the High Council with the Emperor present.\\" As a political body, the Landsraad predates the end of the Butlerian Jihad (itself 10,000 years before the events of the novel) by approximately 2000 years. It was at some point referred to as the Landsraad League, and held influence over more than 13,300 worlds immediately after the Jihad. The word Landsraad is a compound word meaning \\"council of the land\\" (the 's' indicates possessive case). The word exists in several Scandinavian languages but is now spelled Landsr√•d; until the spelling reform of 1948 it was still written as Landsraad in Danish. In Dutch or Afrikaans the word would also be Landsraad, but Herbert borrowed the word from Scandinavian. When asked, he defined the Landsraad thus: > Q: In the novel Dune, what is the Landsraad? > Herbert: Well, Landsraad is an old Scandinavian word for an assembly of > landowners. It's historically accurate in that it was an assembly and the > first meetings of the legislative body ‚Äî an early one, yes. The Landsraad ‚Äî > it's the landed gentry. ;Prequels It is established in the Legends of Dune prequel trilogy (2002-2004) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson that the predecessor to the Landsraad is the League of Nobles. The League is the system of government employed by the remaining free humans before and during the Butlerian Jihad; it is feudal at its core but slightly more democratic than the Landsraad, as the League members vote for which Viceroy they prefer to govern them. After the Jihad and the accession of Faykan Corrino to the new Imperial throne, the Landsraad is formed by the League in order to keep the power of the Corrinos in check. Mentats A Mentat is a fictional type of human, presented in Frank Herbert's science fiction Dune universe. In an interstellar society that fears a resurgence of artificial intelligence and thus prohibits computers, Mentats are specially trained to mimic the cognitive and analytical ability of computers. In Herbert's Dune universe, a historical movement known as the Butlerian Jihad results in the strict prohibition of all thinking machines, including computers, robots and artificial intelligence of any kind. This is a key influence on the nature of Herbert's fictional setting. More than simply calculators, Mentats possess exceptional cognitive abilities of memory and perception that enable them to sift large volumes of data and devise concise analyses. They can accurately assess people and situations by interpreting minor changes in body language or intonation. Early training occurs without the subject's knowledge, and at a certain age they are made aware, and given the choice to continue. Though human nature brings an ethical component to a Mentat's logic and reasoning, the Tleilaxu can create \\"twisted Mentats\\", who are sociopaths free from the usual constraints of human morality and ethical boundaries. Mentat capabilities can be greatly increased by taking sapho juice, an addictive drug extracted from roots found on Ecaz. Repeated use leaves a permanent \\"cranberry-colored stain\\" on the user's lips. In Dune (1965), House Atreides Mentat Thufir Hawat is considered to be one of the finest Mentats of his time, and his prot√©g√© Paul Atreides, is trained as a Mentat. Twisted Mentat Piter De Vries serves as advisor and strategist to the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen in Dune. In Dune Messiah (1969), the Tleilaxu restore renowned Atreides swordsman Duncan Idaho to life as a ghola, Hayt, imbued with the powers of both a Mentat and Zensunni philosopher. In Heretics of Dune (1984) and Chapterhouse: Dune (1985), Miles Teg has an illustrious career as a combined Mentat and high-ranking leader of the Bene Gesserit military forces. In God Emperor of Dune (1981), Leto II outlaws the Mentat order and crushes any renegade training schools he finds. The Bene Gesserit preserve the Mentat discipline, assuming that Leto knows of this through his prescience, and approves. Later, in Chapterhouse Dune, the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Bellonda learns from Other Memory that the Order of Mentats was founded by Gilbertus Albans. ;Prequels The origin of the first Mentat is later explored in the Legends of Dune (2002‚Äì2004) prequels written by Kevin J. Anderson and Brian Herbert. During the Butlerian Jihad, thinking machine leader Omnius sees humans as animals, but the independent robot Erasmus argues that any human can become brilliant. Omnius picks a nine-year-old, blond-haired boy who appears to be the wildest and most unkempt of all, and challenges Erasmus to prove his theory. Erasmus calls the boy Gilbertus Albans, thinking that this sounds like a smart human's name. After initially failing to make progress by using a system of benevolence and rewards, he switches to a system of strict supervision and punishment, and the method works. By emulating Erasmus, whom he has come to consider his father, Albans becomes the first human to display computer-like cognitive and calculation capacity on the level of thinking machines. Because of Gilbertus' remarkable memory-organizational ability and capacity for logical thinking, Erasmus nicknames him \\"Mentat\\", created from the words \\"mentor\\", \\"mentee\\", and \\"mentation\\". Padishah Emperors The Padishah EmperorsPadishah (ŸæÿßÿØÿ¥ÿßŸá) is a Persian title meaning \\"great king\\" or \\"king of kings\\", which was historically given to Persian emperors and kings. are the hereditary rulers of the Old Empire in Frank Herbert's science fiction Dune universe. In Herbert's originating novel Dune (1965) it is established that while the Padishah Emperor is supreme sovereign ruler of the known universe, power is shared, in a quasi-feudal arrangement, with the noble houses of the Landsraad and with the Spacing Guild, which possesses a monopoly over interstellar travel. Members of House Corrino sit on the Golden Lion throne as Padishah Emperors from the time of the ancient Battle of Corrin until the events of Dune some 10,000 years later. Dune establishes that Salusa Secundus had been the homeworld of House Corrino, and at some point the Imperial Court had moved to the planet Kaitain. As Dune begins, the 81st Padishah Emperor is Shaddam IV, but by the end of the novel he is deposed by Duke Paul Atreides in 10,193 A.G. (After Guild) after Paul seizes control of the desert planet Arrakis, the only source of the all-important spice melange. Though Paul subsequently rules as Emperor, the term \\"Padishah\\" is dropped, and the Imperium as it has previously been known essentially ceases to exist since absolute control of the spice gives Paul unprecedented power over the Landsraad, Spacing Guild and all other factions. As detailed in Dune Messiah (1969), Paul's apparent death 13 years later puts his sister Alia in place as Imperial Regent for his children, Leto II and Ghanima. Young Leto ascends the throne in 1976's Children of Dune, becoming a human-sandworm hybrid to achieve superhuman physical abilities and longevity. Leto rules as God Emperor for over 3,500 years; his assassination in God Emperor of Dune (1981) effectively abolishes the Imperial throne. ;Prequels Several prequel novels by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson further explore the back-story of the Dune universe. According to their Legends of Dune prequel trilogy (2002‚Äì2004), the Empire had been founded on Salusa Secundus. Following the human victory over the thinking machines in the Battle of Corrin, Viceroy Faykan Butler takes the last name Corrino in commemoration. He ultimately names himself the first Padishah Emperor, Faykan I. The Prelude to Dune prequel trilogy (1999‚Äì2001) chronicles the last years of the reign of Shaddam's father, Elrood IX, as well as Shaddam's accession and reign until the events of Dune. The series also reveals that, after centuries as the capital of the Corrino Padishah Empire, Salusa had been devastated by atomics. The Imperial throne had been relocated to the planet Kaitain, where it remains for millennia. Rakian Priesthood The Rakian Priesthood is a priestly body that worships the Divided God, Leto II Atreides. They rule Rakis during the time the Lost Ones are returning from the Scattering, approximately 1500 years after Leto II's death. They are presumably descendants of the Fish Speakers priestesses. The Rakian Priesthood maintain that both Muad'Dib and his son Leto II were hallowed, and that Leto was God Himself. Their canon details how, after his death, Leto divided into the sandworms and became Shai-Hulud, hence the term \\"Divided God\\". The Priesthood is largely populated with individuals who lack insight, but possess ambition. After Leto's death, they maintain a brutal rule over Rakis, marked by random executions. Other powers from the Old Imperium, including the Bene Gesserit, the Fish Speakers, and the Bene Tleilax, have come to find them a troublesome, ignorant group. The Bene Gesserit, however, enjoy a particularly great influence over the priesthood. At the time of the discovery of Sheeana, the Priesthood is led by the High Priest Hedley Tuek, a descendant of Esmar Tuek. Tuek is eventually killed by the Tleilaxu and replaced with a Face Dancer, with the approval of the Bene Gesserit. However, the Face Dancer eventually comes to believe that he is Tuek. The entire Rakian Priesthood is later annihilated, along with the planet's population, when the surface of Rakis is sterilized by the Honored Matres. Sardaukar The Sardaukar are a fictional military force from Frank Herbert's Dune universe, primarily featured in the 1965 science fiction novel Dune, as well as Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson's Prelude to Dune prequel trilogy (1999‚Äì2001). They are soldier-fanatics loyal to the Padishah Emperors of House Corrino, who have ruled the known universe for over 10,000 years at the time of the events of Dune. The key to House Corrino's hold on the Imperial throne, the Sardaukar troops are the most formidable professional military in the universe in that time. They are secretly trained on the inhospitable Imperial prison planet Salusa Secundus, and the harsh conditions there ensure that only the strongest and most \\"ferocious\\" men survive. Sardaukar training emphasizes ruthlessness, near-suicidal disregard for personal safety, and the use of cruelty as a standard weapon in order to weaken opponents with terror. Their uniforms are described as gray with silver and gold trim. As Dune begins, the 81st Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV sends Sardaukar to join the forces of the Baron Harkonnen in their attack on the stronghold of Duke Leto Atreides on the desert planet Arrakis. The Atreides forces are decimated and the Duke killed, but Leto's concubine, Lady Jessica, and son, Paul, escape and find refuge with the native Fremen of Arrakis, a fierce people with secretly large numbers and fighting skills rivaling those of the Sardaukar. The Fremen prove capable of holding their own against the Sardaukar and are even able to defeat and capture the \\"undefeatable\\" Emperor's soldiers. Paul's training in Bene Gesserit martial arts and galvanization of their rebellion under his command make the newly allied Fremen forces unstoppable. Using the Bene Gesserit compulsion technique called the Voice, Paul himself manages to compel the Sardaukar Captain Aramsham to humiliate himself by surrendering. However, Aramsham's Sardaukar stoicism is so great that he will not even give his name until Paul uses the Voice again. The defeat of the Sardaukar and Paul's stranglehold on the supply of the all-important spice melange allows him to depose Shaddam, marry his eldest daughter Princess Irulan, and ascend the throne. In Dune Messiah (1969), Shaddam retains a single legion of Sardaukar in his exile on Salusa Secundus. Paul's concubine Chani later recognizes Sardaukar spies hidden among a visiting Spacing Guild entourage, and they are killed. It is also revealed that a \\"wise Sardaukar commander\\" had retrieved the corpse of the slain Atreides Swordmaster Duncan Idaho, which had been entrusted to the Tleilaxu and used to create a ghola duplicate. During the events of Children of Dune (1976), Princess Wensicia, younger daughter of Shaddam IV, initiates a plot for her family and the Sardaukar to return to power. By this time, Paul has improved conditions on Salusa under the guise of making the planet more hospitable for the exiled Corrinos, but with the intent of rendering it an ineffective training ground for more soldiers. Though Wensicia's son Farad'n has tried to maintain the strict discipline that keeps the Sardaukar at their best, when Wensicia's efforts fail Farad'n voluntarily surrenders the army to the new Emperor, Paul's son Leto II Atreides. The text of God Emperor of Dune notes that, during the 3,500-year reign of Leto II after the events of Children of Dune, one of Leto II's many Duncan Idaho gholas had led the remnants of the Sardaukar in an unsuccessful revolt. Leto II finally abolishes the Sardaukar corps, replacing them with the all-female Fish Speakers. Leto believes that male-dominated military organizations are essentially predatory and will turn on the civilian population in the absence of an external enemy. =Merchandising= A line of Dune action figures from toy company LJN was released to lackluster sales in 1984. Styled after David Lynch's film, the collection featured a figure of a Sardaukar warrior, as well as other characters. Spacing Guild The Spacing Guild is an organization in the Dune universe whose monopoly on interstellar travel and banking makes it a balance of power against the Padishah Emperor and the assembled noble Houses of the Landsraad. Mutated Guild Navigators use the spice drug melange to successfully navigate \\"folded space\\" and safely guide enormous heighliner starships from planet to planet instantaneously. Essentially apolitical, the Guild is primarily concerned with the flow of commerce and preservation of the economy that supports them; though their ability to dictate the terms of and fees for all transport gives them influence in the political arena, they do not pursue political goals beyond their economic ones. Suk School The Suk School is a prominent medical school in Frank Herbert's science fiction Dune universe. Suk doctors are the universe's most competent and trusted; those who have received the \\"Suk Imperial Conditioning\\" bear a black diamond tattoo on their foreheads, wear their hair in a special silver ring and, at least theoretically, are incapable of inflicting harm upon their charges. The fallibility of Suk training is proven in Dune (1965), in a situation involving Dr. Wellington Yueh. The Harkonnen twisted Mentat Piter De Vries notes: > Hawat will have divined that we have an agent planted on him ... The obvious > suspect is Dr. Yueh, who is indeed our agent. But Hawat has investigated and > found that our doctor is a Suk School graduate with Imperial Conditioning ‚Äî > supposedly safe enough to minister even to the Emperor. Great store is set > on Imperial Conditioning. It's assumed that ultimate conditioning cannot be > removed without killing the subject. However, as someone once observed, > given the right lever you can move a planet. We found the lever that moved > the doctor. To gain such leverage against Yueh, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen had abducted and tortured Yueh's wife Wanna; the doctor is thus compelled to betray House Atreides in exchange for her release. Even so, Yueh allows Paul and Lady Jessica to escape the attack and gives Duke Leto Atreides the means to kill the Baron (though the Duke fails to do so). Later in the series, in Heretics of Dune (1984) and Chapterhouse: Dune (1985), many Bene Gesserits are trained by Suk Schools to become doctors for the Sisterhood. ;Prequels The origins of the school are explored in the Legends of Dune prequel trilogy (2002-2004) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. It gets its name from Dr. Mohandas Suk, a physician instrumental in fighting a catastrophic thinking machine-created plague among humans during the Butlerian Jihad. After the war he sets out to establish a medical institution which will assure \\"that no threat of machine, war, or plague can ever harm us again.\\" Swordmasters of Ginaz The Swordmasters of Ginaz are a school of martial artists in Frank Herbert's science fiction Dune universe. They are mentioned briefly in 1965's Dune and its 1969 sequel Dune Messiah. \\"Terminology of the Imperium\\" in the Appendix of Dune notes that House Ginaz are \\"one-time allies of Duke Leto Atreides\\" and are \\"defeated in the War of Assassins with Grumman.\\" Duncan Idaho is noted to be a \\"Swordmaster of the Ginaz,\\" which leads to his body later being sold to the Tleilaxu as \\"a master swordsman, an adept of the Ginaz School.\\" ;Prequels The school's origins are detailed in the Legends of Dune prequel trilogy (2002-2004) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. Jool Noret of the ocean- covered planet Ginaz uses personal tragedy to make himself a fierce and innovative warrior, distinguishing himself in the ongoing war against the machine forces of Omnius in the Butlerian Jihad.

Thinking machines Thinking machines (a cymek and Erasmus) from the cover of Dune: The Machine Crusade (2003) Thinking machines is a collective term for artificial intelligence in Frank Herbert's science fiction Dune universe. The Butlerian Jihad a human crusade against thinking machines is an epic turning point in the back-story of the Dune universe. The thinking machines are first mentioned in 1965's Dune, the glossary of which includes the following: > JIHAD, BUTLERIAN: (see also Great Revolt) ‚Äî the crusade against computers, > thinking machines, and conscious robots begun in 201 B.G. and concluded in > 108 B.G. Its chief commandment remains in the O.C. Bible as \\"Thou shalt not > make a machine in the likeness of a human mind.\\" In Dune Messiah (1969), the Tleilaxu Face Dancer Scytale notes that \\"From the days of the Butlerian Jihad when 'thinking machines' had been wiped from most of the universe, computers had inspired distrust.\\" Herbert refers to thinking machines and the Jihad several times in his later works in the Dune series, but does not give much detail on how he imagined either. In God Emperor of Dune (1981), Leto II Atreides indicates that the Jihad had been a semi- religious social upheaval initiated by humans who felt repulsed by how guided and controlled they had become by machines: > \\"The target of the Jihad was a machine-attitude as much as the machines,\\" > Leto said. \\"Humans had set those machines to usurp our sense of beauty, our > necessary selfdom out of which we make living judgments. Naturally, the > machines were destroyed.\\" Later in the same novel, Leto tests Siona Atreides, who experiences a vision of the future Leto is trying to prevent with his Golden Path mankind's extinction at the hands of \\"seeking machines\\": > He knew this experience, but could not change the smallest part of it. No > ancestral presences would remain in her consciousness, but she would carry > with her forever afterward the clear sights and sounds and smells. The > seeking machines would be there, the smell of blood and entrails, the > cowering humans in their burrows aware only that they could not escape . . . > while all the time the mechanical movement approached, nearer and nearer and > nearer ...louder...louder! Everywhere she searched, it would be the same. No > escape anywhere. Herbert's death in 1986 left this topic unexplored and open to speculation. ;Prequels Chronicling the Butlerian Jihad, the Legends of Dune prequel trilogy (2002‚Äì2004) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson establishes that the thinking machines are a host of destructive robots led by Omnius, a sentient computer network. A thousand years before the Jihad, a group of twenty dissident humans had used thinking machines to enslave the rest of mankind, and then converted themselves into weaponized human-machine hybrids called cymeks. Essentially immortal and unstoppable, they had become known as the Titans, but after a century had been overthrown themselves by Omnius and made his servants. Mankind suffers under thinking machine oppression for another 900 years, before the murder of young Manion Butler at the hands of the independent robot Erasmus incites the Butlerian Jihad. The last remaining free humans fight for a century before finally defeating the machines in the Battle of Corrin. ;Sequels In Hunters of Dune (2006), Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson's first of a two-part finale to Frank Herbert's original series, the antagonists Daniel and Marty (introduced in Frank Herbert's 1985 Chapterhouse: Dune) are revealed to be incarnations of Omnius and Erasmus. In the third Legends novel Dune: The Battle of Corrin (2004), Omnius had sent out a last burst of information before being destroyed in the Battle of Corrin; it is explained in Hunters that this signal had eventually connected with one of the probes disseminated from Giedi Prime several decades earlier, uploading versions of Erasmus and Omnius. Titans The Titans are a group of warlike cyborgs in the Legends of Dune (2002‚Äì2004) trilogy of prequel novels, written by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson and set in Frank Herbert's science fiction Dune universe. Over 11,000 years before the events of Frank Herbert's Dune (1965), a group of 20 ambitious humans see the stagnation of the Old Empire and realize that their small band can take control of it with the aid of thinking machines. Calling themselves the Titans, they rule humanity for a hundred years and rename themselves after famous historical and mythological figures, most notably Agamemnon, Ajax, Barbarossa, Dante, Hecate, Juno, Tlaloc and Xerxes. Eventually the group separates to each rule their own worlds in the galaxy, utilizing the thinking machines that had originally brought them to power as the means to control entire planets. Realizing that their human bodies are fragile and their lifespans limited, the Titans find a way to extend their lives indefinitely: installing their brains with the help of specialized interfaces into large, walking machine bodies. Calling themselves cymeks, the Titans become virtually unstoppable in these new fearsome, weaponized bodies. Having pushed to the very farthest limits of artificial intelligence, their own machines run their empire for them for a century. Then, having mistakenly given one attendant AI program too much autonomy, the Titans suddenly find themselves overthrown and enslaved by an AI consciousness calling itself Omnius that seizes control of the entire universe through the interconnected machine network. For over 900 years the Titans live in perpetual servitude to Omnius, cruelly subjugating humanity, quelling human insurrections and secretly plotting their own return to power. The murder of young Manion Butler at the hands of the independent robot Erasmus finally incites the Butlerian Jihad; the last remaining free humans fight for a century before finally destroying both Omnius' forces and the remaining Titans in the Battle of Corrin.

The residences are built atop the historic Old Chronicle Building, sometimes called the de Young Building, which was constructed in 1890. It is the first skyscraper built in California. History In 1888, M. H. de Young, owner of the San Francisco Chronicle, commissioned Burnham and Root to design a signature building to house his newspaper. Finished in 1890, the Chronicle Building stood ten stories, with a clock tower reaching in height, becoming San Francisco's first skyscraper and the tallest building on the West Coast. In 1905, a celebration of the re- election of Mayor Eugene Schmitz stopped in front of the building and launched fireworks, which ignited the wooden clock tower atop the building. The damaged clock tower was removed and de Young added two additional floors along Market Street and a 16-story annex along Kearny Street. The Chronicle Building survived the 1906 San Francisco earthquake but was badly damaged by the ensuing fire, which gutted the interior. The building was rebuilt by architect Willis Polk, who ran the San Francisco office of Burnham and Root. In 1924, the Chronicle moved to its present location at Fifth and Mission streets, and the old Chronicle Building became a normal office building, thenceforth known as the de Young Building or Old Chronicle Building. In 1962, in an effort to modernize the building, its owners covered the original masonry facade with a new facade of aluminum, glass, and porcelain paneling. By 2004, new owners received approval to restore the original facade, convert the building to residential use, and add eight stories to the existing structure. The Old Chronicle Building was designated San Francisco Landmark No. 243 in 2004. The building re-opened as the Ritz-Carlton Club and Residences in November 2007.

Early life Bradshaw was born in Melbourne in 1854, one of seven children born to a Victorian landowner. His father, Joseph Senior, owned Avoca and Bacchus Marsh stations. Little is known of his childhood other than he had an adventurous spirit and was ambitious and determined, and received his education in Melbourne. Western Australia After reading positive reports on pastoral prospects of the Kimberley district in Western Australia written by Alexander Forrest and also influenced by earlier stories by Philip Parker King Bradshaw formed a syndicate to acquire land along the Prince Regent River. In 1890 received approval for 20 blocks of land each with a size of , a total area of on either side of the river. In January 1891, Bradshaw left Melbourne for Wyndham only to find the town had been destroyed by a cyclone when he arrived.

He soon returned with a group of settlers including his cousin, Aeneus Gunn, and his wife via Darwin. A trial mob of sheep were landed and used to stock the property before cattle were to be introduced. Bradshaw tried to introduce cattle in 1894 but received a large livestock tax bill that resulted in him abandoning his property and acquiring new lands in the Victoria River district in the Northern Territory. Northern Territory The leases to lands along the Victoria River were acquired by Bradshaw in 1894, the property known as Bradshaw's Run or Bradshaw Station occupied an area of .

Bradshaw worked with a London syndicate to acquire of land on the western side of the Gulf of Carpentaria taking in most of the country between Cape Wessels and the Roper River. The intention of the syndicate was to explore for minerals and pursue pastoral interests. The area was known as Arafura Station. In the Victoria River district a second lease of was granted to Frederick Bradshaw, Joseph's brother, in 1898. Frederick joined his brother in 1898 to stock the property with sheep and both leases, which shared a boundary, were being run as one entity. Frederick was murdered along with six companions in 1905 by Aborigines when travelling by boat along the Cambridge Gulf The men were attacked during the night after they landed for wood and fresh water. The property was initially stocked with sheep but the Bradshaws had little luck with lambing, attacks from Aborigines and dingos as well as grass seeds and focused their efforts on cattle instead.

About half of the area overlaps with a Japanese ADIZ, while also overlapping to a small extent with the South Korean and Taiwanese ADIZ.

Japan's ADIZ was established in 1969, which covers most of its Exclusive Economic Zone. Japan makes no demands on aircraft flying through, unless they are landing in Japan. The ADIZ was revised in the same year that the U.S.-Japan Okinawa Reversion Treaty provided for the return of the Ryukyu Islands and the Dait≈ç Islands to Japan in 1972. Japan's ADIZ was created by the United States Armed Forces during the post-WWII Allied occupation, with the western border at 123¬∞ degrees east. This resulted in only the eastern half of Yonaguni Island being part of Japan's ADIZ and the western half being part of Taiwan's ADIZ. On 25 June 2010, Japan extended its ADIZ around Yonaguni 22 km westwards. This led to an overlapping with sections of Taiwan's ADIZ. However, Taiwanese foreign affairs officials said that it does not make any difference, as an understanding has been reached between the two parties on how to handle it. According to China Network Television on 24 November 2013, China and Russia do not recognize Japan's ADIZ. The People's Republic of China announced the establishment of what it called its East China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone on 23 November 2013 defining an ADIZ as a zone that allowed a coastal state to \\"identify, monitor, control and react to aircraft entering this zone with potential air threats.\\"Defense Spokesman Yang Yujun‚Äôs Response to Questions on the Establishment of The East China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone Ministry of National Defense of the People's Republic of China 23 November 2013. Despite several international protests, China's move received broad domestic support. According to a 2011 study of the justifications for establishing an ADIZ, at that time there had not yet been a \\"recorded instance of protest\\" against the initial establishment of an ADIZ. The Chinese Air Force Command Academy began planning for an ADIZ after the Hainan Island incident and in May 2013 had suggested an ADIZ that covered China's exclusive economic zone, but this was expanded during review by the PLA to the current area. On 25 July 2015, Lao Airlines flight QV916 was turned back by the Chinese. The Chinese MoD has said that the aircraft was prevented from entering Chinese territory due to an inadequate flight plan, and that the incident had nothing to do with the ADIZ.  Administration and monitoring operations  = Identification rules = According to the Chinese Ministry of National Defense, foreign aircraft in the zone will be expected to abide by the following: * Identification of flight plan. Any aircraft in the zone must report its flight plan to China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Civil Aviation Administration. * Radio identification. Aircraft in the zone must maintain two-way radio communication and respond in a timely and accurate manner to inquiries * Responder identification. Any aircraft with an Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System transponder must keep it on during the aircraft's time in the zone * Sign identification.

In response to Japan's China ADIZ accusation of \\"one-sided action\\" and its demand of China to scrap its new ADIZ China's Defence Ministry questioned Japan's justification, double standards and credibility by stating that Japan, having its own ADIZ established 44 years ago in 1969 and unilaterally extended it twice and \\"one- sidedly allowed the zone to cover the Senkaku Islands\\", has \\"no right\\" to ask China to withdraw its ADIZ, adding that China would like to ask Japan to \\"revoke its own ADIZ first, China will then consider this request in 44 years\\". China also accused the European Union of double standards in response to the comments of its top diplomat. A Chinese Ministry of National Defense spokesman said there were \\"misunderstandings or even distortions\\" about the operation of the ADIZ and insisted that it was not a no-fly zone and \\"will not affect the freedom of overflight, based on international laws, of other countries' aircraft\\" adding that its purpose was \\"to set aside enough time for early warning to defend the country's airspace, with defense acting as the key point.

Vijay Milton. Produced by his brother Bharath Seeni under Roughnote Production, the film features Kishore, Sree Raam, Pakoda Pandi and Murugesh of Pasanga fame. The film was distributed by N. Lingusamy's Thirrupathi Brothers and released on 24 January 2014 to critical acclaim. The film narrates the story of four boys who work and live together in a market. The film was remade in Kannada with the same name and in Telugu as Evadu Thakkuva Kadu in 2019. Goli Soda 2, featuring an entirely distinct cast, was released in June 2018.  Plot  Set against the backdrop of Koyambedu market, the film revolves around the lives of four young boys: Pulli (Kishore), Saetu (Sree Raam), Sitthappa (Pandi) and Kuttimani (Murugesh). They work as coolies, and earn their bread by working as lifters. They lift and transport vegetable goods to various shops. One such shop is owned by Aachi(Sujatha Sivakumar), who treats the boys like her sons. The boys are carefree and do not worry about their future, and have fun by teasing and looking at schoolgirls who pass by. They befriend a girl named Vanmathi a.k.a. ATM (Seetha), who assists them in finding a new friend, who turns out to be Aachi's daughter, Yamini. They all become friends and hang out together. One day Aachi tells the boys that, they do not have an identity and how long will they live like this? She advises them to do something that will give them an identity and let them earn some respect. They decide to start a mess in the market, where so many people will have access. Aachi helps them to get an old godown from Naidu (Madhusudhan Rao), a rich Dada, who controls the market. Naidu lets them have the place for free for now, and says will collect the rent later. The boys start the mess and it becomes an instant hit, earning them money and respect. The boys feel that they have now got an identity as the owners of Aachi mess. Things take a turn, when Mayil, the cousin of Naidu, starts using the mess for his own recreational purpose during the night. The boys allow him first due to their respect for Naidu, but later on Mayil uses the mess for wrong purposes. One night Mayil rapes a woman in the mess, and Sitthappa, one of the boys is upset with this, and he orders Mayil to get out of the mess immediately. Infuriated, Mayil beats him, and sends him back. The other boys come to know about this, and the next day, they come to the mess and find it still locked. Mayil is still in the mess with hangover and has made a complete mess of the place. The boys get angry and ask him to go out. But as Mayil refuses and attacks them, the boys retaliate and Mayil is pushed down. Mayil starts to attack the boys, and the boys overpower Mayil, and beat him. Angry and humiliated, Mayil leaves the place. Naidu comes to know about this and is extremely angry. Aachi goes to meet Naidu to apologise for the boys, but Naidu doesn't accept and keeps her hostage, till the boys get punished back. Naidu sends his group of men along with Mayil to beat the boys inside the mess, in front of everyone in the market, just like the boys did to him. The boys are forced and they are targeted and mauled by Naidu's men. They are beaten up. At one stage when Mayil tried to assault Yamini and Vanmathi, the boys start to retaliate and somehow get the upper hand. They then attack the men using weapons found in the market and drive them away. Naidu gets further angry. The boys take Mayil as hostage and tells Naidu that if they release Aachi, they will release Mayil. All these incidents make Naidu angry on the boys and vows to take revenge on them. So he plans and attacks the boys once again, makes them unconscious and separates them by sending them to different parts of the country. The boys reunite after some struggle with the help of Vanmathi, and decide to exact revenge on Naidu, for making them lose their identity. They come back to the market and start their restaurant again. Naidu is pretty surprised about this and goes to confront the boys, but they are saved by a cop. The boys decide to avenge their feelings by making Naidu lose the fear people have on him, and oppose him in the market elections. Naidu fears losing the election and he decides to kill the boys and sends all his men to search for them. The boys hide and since Naidu has sent all his men away, they come to know that Naidu must be alone and they take on him. They see Naidu sleeping and they cut of his hair and paste a coin his head, symbolising that he is dead. The next morning, Naidu sees this and is angered to the core. He directly goes himself to the mess and locks it from inside to kill the boys. The boys outpower him and tie him to a post and strip him naked. They threaten to open the door thus making his respect turn into shame. Naidu begs them not to do so, and pleads them to kill him instead of showing him nude to the outside world. The boys then tell Naidu that the identity of a man is more important and he has finally learnt that. Naidu becomes guilt ‚Äî ridden, and the boys are forgiven by Naidu and vice versa. The boys continue to run the mess successfully. The movie emphasises two important things. First, one's identity is important and worth fighting for. Second, forgiving and giving a chance to repent can change lives for good. Then, it hints that Sithappa with Vanmathi and Puli with Yamini starting a romantic relationships.

Goli Soda is his second directorial venture. The inspiration for the story came during an early morning visit to Koyambedu market. \\"I was passing through Koyambedu Market one morning, when I witnessed hundreds of young boys sleeping in its attics. That triggered my curiosity and I started researching them. I learnt that their world revolves only around this 'market', they do not have any other identity. Even when they get old, they indulge in activities like selling ganja and putting up petty tea shops inside the market. I immediately decided to make a film on them.\\" Filming took place in Chennai's Koyambedu market, Alappuzha in Kerala and Murudeshwara temple in Karnataka.

Synopsis  The film follows 13-year-old football starlet Pablo Rosario around for a year, Pablo is thirteen and follows a general secondary education, while playing for local football club DWS, the same club that produced the likes of Frank Rijkaard and Ruud Gullit, Dutch international football stars who both found their start in the youth ranks of this same club. Just like many football playing boys his age, Pablo dreams of one day playing for FC Barcelona. His coach is convinced of the young boys talent and foresees a great future for him. Filmmaker Jack Janssen follows Pablo for a whole year, a year where all three of the Dutch big three Ajax, PSV and Feyenoord express an interest in contracting the young child. Janssen shows Pablo's performance on the pitch, where he is able to effortlessly dissect his opponents, with his family watching, where his father showers him with well-intended, but oftentimes inconsistent advice. At school things are running less smoothly for young Pablo, while the film offers insight into the world of a young professional footballer, where a continuous and often even tougher battle for young talents is fought by the top clubs.

She was found guilty of murdering a local miner, Frederick Cannon. She is known to be the first and only woman to be hanged in California.Gutierrez, Margo, and Matt S. Meier. Encyclopedia of the Mexican American Civil Rights Movement. Greenwood, 2000. Print. p. 135-136.  Early life and controversy about her name  Not much is known about the early life of Josefa Segovia.

Josefa's actual name has been a topic of debate among historians and scholars. Before the Chicano Civil Rights Movement, most scholars stated that Josefa had no recorded last name. In Gordon Young's Days of 49, he says that her name was \\"Juanita\\". Hubert Bancroft in his account of the eventhttps://www.hhhistory.com/2016/08/josefa-segovia-pretty-juanita.htmls at Downieville refers to Segovia as either \\"The Mexican\\" or \\"the little woman\\" but used Juanita during his description of her trial.Bancroft, Hubert. \\"The Downieville Tragedy.\\" The Works of Hubert Howe Bancroft. San Francisco: The History Company. 1887. Historian Rodolpho F. Acuna stated her name was Juana Loaiza citing an 1877 Schedule of Mexican Claims Against the United States that listed a Jose Maria Loiza as claiming damages for the lynching of his wife. However, the name does not show up in the 1850 census, which suggests that the claim may have been fraudulent. In 1976, Martha Cotera, an influential activist of both the Chicano Movement and Chicana Feminist Movement, informed Chicano scholars that her last name was Segovia.  Adult life  = Family = Irene I. Blea's book U.S. Chicanas and Latinas in a Historical Context claims that Josefa was a Sonoran and of good character. She was about 26 years old at the time of her death. Kerry Segrave recounts Josefa Segovia's life in Downieville, California, also known as \\"The Forks\\" for its location at the north fork of the Yuba River. She lived with a Mexican gambler, Jos√©, in a small house on the main street of town. It is not completely clear if they were married or not.Segrave, Kerry.

Jefferson: McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers, 2010. 21-22. eBook. p. 21-22. = Reputation in Downieville = Plaque on the Craycroft Building in Downieville commemorating Segovia's hanging Josefa was probably not married to Jos√©, but she did live with him. Therefore, she received a bad reputation. According to one account, Juanita (read Josefa) was slender and barely tall.Young, Gordon. \\"Days of 49'.\\" Popular Tribunals[Downieville, California] 1851, Volume 1 Pg. 417-557. Web. 4 Nov. 2013. The same account states that Josefa was beautiful, vivacious and intelligent. Some say that she was not at all disliked in the mining camp in Downieville. Downie relates the story in the following fashion. Juanita had accompanied her partner to Downieville from Mexico and both lived in an adobe house. Downie states, \\"Whether she was his wife or not makes no difference in this story.\\" He further describes her figure as \\"richly developed and in strict proportions.\\" Only her temper was \\"not well balanced.\\" Celebrating the Fourth of July, Cannon and companions were returning from the dram shop at a late hour, with Cannon staggering from the influence of liquor. Along the way, he stumbled through the door of the adobe hut. His friends quickly pulled him back outside and they proceeded home. Mortified the next morning of his embarrassing blunder, he proceeded to the hut to offer an apology in Spanish. This did not go well with the Mexican couple, and Juanita grew angry. In a rage, she drew a knife and stabbed Cannon. Soon a \\"mob of infuriated men\\" gathered, ready to invoke the \\"miner's law\\" of a \\"Life for Life\\". Only a Mr. Thayer came to her defense, but to no avail as she was quickly tried and found guilty. A scaffold was erected and the \\"howling blood- thirsty mob...cried for vengeance\\" according to Downie. Downie states Juanita retold the story of the \\"unfortunate incident\\", how she had been \\"provoked\\" and if done so again would \\"repeat her act.\\" She then took the rope, placed the noose around her neck, said \\"Adi√≥s Se√±ores!\\" and \\"leaped from the scaffold into eternity.\\" Downie concludes by stating \\"it was one of those blots that stained the early history of California.\\"  Social and racial environment for Latinos in California  Map of California during the Gold Rush In 1835, Andrew Jackson tried to buy California for $3.5 million, but Mexico refused the offer. Ten years later, James K. Polk suggested annexing Texas, but also put California as a high priority on his list of territory to acquire. The US and Mexico went to war on May 13, 1846. Two years later on February 2, 1848, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed. What neither the U.S. or Mexico realized was that 9 days earlier, gold had been found in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. It is estimated that between 1848 and 1852, as many as 25,000 Mexicans migrated to California to mine.Carrigan, William D., and Clive Webb. \\"The Lynching of Persons of Mexican Origin or Descent in the United States, 1848 To 1928.\\" Journal of Social History. 37.2 (2003): n. page. Web. In the fall of 1848, as many as 3,000 Mexicans migrated to the mining regions. Often, they traveled as entire families.\\"Mexicans in the Gold Rush.\\" PBS. PBS, 13 Sept. 2006. Web. 04 Dec. 2013. After hearing of the gold, thousands of American men borrowed money, mortgaged their homes, or spent their life savings to travel to California and take advantage of the opportunity to find gold. Because society at the time was based on a waged labor, the idea that a person could obtain wealth by finding gold became irresistible.\\"The California Gold Rush.\\" PBS. PBS, 13 Sept. 2006. Web. 05 Dec. 2013. By 1849, the population of non-native Californians grew to over 100,000. Two-thirds of this non-native population were Americans. Despite the fact that the work of mining was the hardest kind of labor, the promise of gold drew miners west every year. In 1848, when the California Gold Rush began, the population of the state was a Mexican majority. However, this Mexican population fell to 15% by 1850 and to 4% by 1870.California Department of Parks and Recreation. California Department of Parks and Recreation, 1988. Print. <>. Northern California, where Downieville is located, received the majority of the Anglo migration during the beginning of the Gold Rush. The Mexican majority in 1848 allowed for many successes for early racial relations. For example, all state laws and regulations were to be translated into Spanish.Rosales, Francisco Arturo.

Print. = Trial = The American mining population in Downieville was enraged by Cannon's death. Josefa was put on trial the next day, and the jury consisted of Cannon's friends and companions while the rest of Downieville waited for the results. Supposedly, a physician, Dr. Cyrus D. Aiken, testified that Josefa was not in a fit condition to be hanged Protests immediately followed the doctor's testimony and he was forced from the stand and from the town. Moments later, Josefa was found guilty of the murder of Cannon. Also, Mr. Thayer, a lawyer from Nevada attempted to testify against the execution of Juanita but was beaten off the stand. Reportedly, he asked for a fair trial for Juanita to see if a murder had really been committed.\\"Woman up in the west\\". Fairbanks Weekly News ‚Äì Miner [Alaska], January 21, 1921, p. 15. = Death: July 5, 1851 = For the lynching, a scaffold was constructed on the bridge over the Yuba River. The town came to stand on the banks of the river and watch her execution. It was an important event to lessen the anger of the townspeople over Cannon's death. Josefa was hanged immediately following the trial, and some accounts say that her last words before she was executed were \\"Adi√≥s Se√±ores\\".Popular Tribunals. Vol. i, p. 557 seq. She is widely known to be the first woman to be executed by hanging in California Mr. Manly wrote, \\"Juanita went calmly to her death. She wore a Panama hat, and after mounting the platform she removed it, tossed it to a friend in the crowd, whose nickname was 'Oregon,' with the remark, 'Adios, amigo.' Then she adjusted the noose to her own neck, raising her long, loose tresses carefully in order to fix the rope firmly in its place; and then, with a smile and wave of her hand to the bloodthirsty crowd present, she stepped calmly from the plank into eternity. Singularly enough, her body rests side by side, in the cemetery on the hill, with that of the man whose life she had taken.\\" Mr. Manly's book is generally a first person account of his experiences migrating to California to mine for gold. Although he did mine for gold near Downieville in 1851, he, by his own account, was not in Downieville on the dates in question. He does not cite the source for his version of the events though it seems conceivable he heard eye- witness accounts. Some witnesses recalled Juanita saying before she died: \\"'I would do the same again if I was so provoked.'\\".Rubio, J'Aime. \\"First Recorded Hanging of a Woman in California History.\\" Dreaming Casually, 07 08 2013. Web. 12 Dec. 2013. This is one of many characteristics pointed out by some who are of the opinion that she must have been an aggressive woman. This has been used to advance the idea that those who lynched her may have been right that she had murdered Joe the miner when he was not actually threatening her safety. Another fact brought up to support this idea is that the townsfolk noted that she was quick to anger. Due to conflicting witness statements and vague details some modern commentators still fall on the side of Frederick Cannon. This shows that while most current thoughts about the incident take race and gender status as strong indicators that the story given by the vigilantes was most likely inaccurate some today still believe that their actions were justified.

He was sent out in 1838, in company with John Hunt, to labour amongst the cannibals in Fiji, where he remained for eighteen years, during which time he witnessed marvellous triumphs of Christianity. In his labours among the Fijians he was ably assisted by his heroic wife, Mary Fowler Calvert, who was in every way a model missionary's wife, and much of the wonderful success of those years was due to her patient, self-denying labours. By Calvert's ministry the Fijian King Seru Epenisa Cakobau was converted to Christianity, renounced polygamy, and for many years after lived a consistent life. His last act as a king was to cede Fiji to Great Britain. In 1856 Calvert returned to England, and during his stay in the country superintended the printing of the entire Scriptures in the Fijian language. In 1872 he was sent out by the Wesleyan Missionary Society to South Africa. He died at Hastings, England, in 1892 aged seventy-nine.

Having friends in New South Wales, Calvert and a brother decided to migrate there, in 1840. On the voyage to Australia, in the ship Sir Edward Paget, Calvert developed a lasting friendship with Dr. Ludwig Leichhardt, the explorer. They arrived in Australia in 1841. The result was that Calvert agreed to accompany Leichhardt on his first expedition, providing his own horses and outfit. The party left Moreton Bay settlement (Brisbane) in 1844 for Port Essington, on the north coast, and after many hardships and difficulties, including numerous conflicts with Aborigines, accomplished their mission and returned to Sydney late in 1845. Details of the expedition were later published by Leichhardt, who wrote: \\"The only one who behaved perfectly, with few exceptions, was a young man, Mr. Calvert, who came in the same boat with me from England\\". Calvert was an exhibitor at the earlier exhibitions in London and Paris, and at the 1862 International Exhibition, London, was awarded a silver medal for his collection of Australian paper-making materials.

These components would be combined into a single entity under the direct command of the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Qin Gang, the NSC aims to combat terrorism, separatism, and religious extremism. It will also deal with national security strategy, crisis management, and links with foreign national security agencies. Analysts regarded the establishment of the NSC one of the most \\"concrete\\" and \\"eye-catching\\" outcomes of the Plenary Session, the culmination of a more than decade-long internal debate on whether China should have a national security council.  Origins  The initial conception of the CNSC came during the Jiang Zemin era in 1997, with a proposal by Wang Daohan, later the president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits. Jiang had taken interest in the United States National Security Council during his state visit to the United States that year. Out of concern that the establishment of such a body would give too much power to the leader, who would be head of both the commission and the Central Military Commission, it was never implemented. The proposal was again reconsidered in 1999 after the United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade due to concern over how long it took various state security agencies to gather information on the incident and make it known to Chinese leadership. Xi Jinping later revived the idea as part of his reforms in the foreign policy and security sectors, as part of an attempt to overcome problems that have accumulated for many years. The CNSC would thus fulfill Xi Jinping's ambitions for \\"Big power diplomacy with Chinese characteristics,\\" rather than the quieter foreign policy agendas of previous administrations. Having a National Security Council assists in China's own \\"self-identification as a big power in world affairs.\\" This also requires a more advanced diplomatic capability, a tasks in which the CNSC is supposed to assist in.  Purpose  The most common explanation for the creation of the CNSC relate to the personal and leadership style of Xi Jinping, and, in the eyes of commentators, his ambition to seize power. These personal factors, however, coincide with China wielding a much greater level of national power. Xi wishes China to play a greater role in world affairs, and so a mechanism like the CNSC would allow it to plan and implement, from the center, \\"grand strategy\\" ideas and \\"big power diplomacy.\\" Xi Jinping articulated a concept of \\"big security\\" in the first meeting of the CNSC on April 15, 2014, saying that China \\"should take an overall approach to national security, strengthen the confidence of the Chinese people in the path, theories and system of socialism with distinctive Chinese features, and ensure China‚Äôs durable peace and stability.\\" These definitions contain meanings of both domestic security and foreign threats.

It is allegedly descended from a poodle of the same name who was owned by New York City millionaire Ella Wendel in 1931. When Ella died, she allegedly left her dog an amount between $30 million to $80 million. All of that dog's descendants were supposedly named Toby Rimes and inherited the money. This story is an urban legend, although there was a real dog named Tobey. The name \\"Toby Rimes\\" appeared in a March 15, 2004 London Mirror article by Dawn Knight. It contained a list of 20 of the world's richest pets. Toby Rimes was said by Knight to be a descendant of the original Toby who inherited 15 million pounds \\"from New York owner Ella Wendel.\\" Since then numerous media outlets have repeated the story of Toby Rimes with embellishments. Some articles included a photo of a white poodle in sunglasses. The photo is actually a stock photo and is copyrighted by Eric Isselee. The story of the inheritance dates back to at least 1933 when the New York correspondent of the London Daily Express incorrectly reported that \\"Toby\\" inherited 15 million pounds and the claim was picked up by newspapers around the world. \\"WORLD'S RICHEST DOG DEAD\\" was the headline in the Australian newspaper, the Melbourne Argus. In 1931 most American newspapers reported that Ella Wendel died leaving \\"Tobey\\" penniless. The Wilmington Morning News headline read, \\"$100,000,000 WILLED; WENDEL DOG PENNILESS.\\" The article from AP said \\"Tobey was the pet of Miss Ella Wendel, who died the other day and bequeathed more than $100,000,000 without mentioning the fluffy, fat Tobey, except by inference. The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in New York was willed about $3,500,000 and a similar society in Massachusetts, $700,000.\\" According to New York city attorney Mervin Rosenman who viewed Ella Wendel's will and probate file for his book on the battle for the Wendel estate, Ella Wendel made \\"no designation of the person to care for him and no bequest of money for his support.\\" A transcript of the will of Ella Wendel on Ancestry has no mention of Toby or Tobey but does mention \\"Five equal shares\\" for the \\"American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals\\" and \\"One equal share\\" for \\"The Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.\\" In 1933 Time Magazine said that \\"Tobey, the last of a succession of 18 similarly-named French poodles, was not even mentioned in the will disposing of the late, eccentric Ella Virginia von Echtzel Wendel's $40,000,000 estate.\\" In 1951 Time Magazine published another article about \\"Tobey.\\" They wrote, \\"Newsmen dubbed Tobey 'the richest dog in the world.' But, while Miss Wendel left an estate of $40 million, her will made no mention of Tobey.... \\"Last week the late, long-forgotten Tobey achieved new fame. Moscow Radio Commentator Berko told listeners about 'the little dog Tobey who lives in a very beautiful, richly decorated house, built by the best architects in the country . . . His mistress, a mad American woman, left it $75 million . . . The dog sleeps on a 'golden bed. It is attended by a staff of 45 servants and six lawyers.\\" Moral for Moscow: 'While the millionaire dog lives in a beautiful private house, the children of the workers, dressed in tatters, roam the streets begging for a piece of bread. Like stray dogs, they sleep in the open . . . searching for food in the rubbish.'\\" By 1985, Toby was mentioned in the Guinness Book of Pet Records. \\"The richest dog on record was a standard poodle named 'Toby', who was left the modern equivalent of ¬£15 million in the will of his eccentric American owner, Miss Ella Wendel, who died in New York in 1931.\\" Since then Toby was listed in multiple Guinness books as the \\"richest dog.\\" When the real Tobey died in 1933, his obituary was published in the New York Times under the headline \\"ELLA WENDEL'S DOG DIES AT OLD HOME; Tobey, Last of Long Line, Had Exclusive Play Rights in Valuable 5th Av.

Early life and education Johnson was born in Seattle to a family of outdoor enthusiasts. He received his undergraduate and graduate education at the University of Washington, earning a master's degree in forestry in 1950. His graduate thesis was on the use of education to prevent forest fires. While at the UW he was elected president of the Associated Students of the University of Washington. In 1948 Johnson married his first wife, Bette Maples, with whom he had four children. Career =Public relations= In 1951, Johnson was hired as the first public relations director for the Washington Education Association, Washington's teacher's union. He was subsequently retained to work as PR head for Weyerhauser. =Republican party= In 1963, Johnson was selected to serve as chairman of the campaign committee for Dan Evans' gubernatorial race. The election of Evans, who at 39 became Washington's youngest governor, placed Johnson at the center of Washington political life. The following year he was elected the first full-time chairman of the Washington State Republican Party, a post he held for the next seven years, during which he led a purge of John Birch Society members from Republican ranks and served as an executive member of the Republican National Committee. Johnson was an outspoken pro-choice advocate and promoter of Native American issues. =Private business= Stepping down from chairmanship of the Republican party, Johnson formed a political consulting firm with his second wife, Ann Quantock, a Democratic lobbyist. One of the Olympia-based C. Montgomery Johnson Associates' first clients was the Washington Association of Community Colleges, the first of several public sector education clients that would retain his firm. Among his firm's other clients were the Yakima Nation, and Democratic governor Dixy Lee Ray, whose 1976 and 1980 campaigns he managed.

Biography Hanaya was born in Katsuta District, Okayama as the son of a village headman. He attended military preparatory schools, and graduated from the 26th class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in May 1914 and was initially assigned to the IJA 54th Infantry Regiment. He graduated from the 34th class of the Army Staff College in November 1922. Hanaya served in the early portion of his career in the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office, and was also stationed at Zhengzhou in China under orders from the Kwantung Army. In August 1929, he became a battalion commander with the IJA 37th Infantry Regiment. As a major in 1931, he was assigned to the military intelligence section of the Kwantung Army and served as head of the Mukden Special Operations Office. In this capacity, he was deeply involved in planning the Mukden Incident with General Seishiro Itagaki and General Kanji Ishiwara, which led to the subsequent Japanese occupation of Manchuria. Hanaya subsequently commanded a battalion of the IJA 35th Regiment and returned to the staff of the Kwantung Army in 1935, and the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff in 1936. In August 1937, Hanaya was promoted to colonel, and was given command of the IJA 43rd Infantry Regiment. This regiment was involved in combat in Shanghai around the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War. He was appointed head of the Japanese military delegation to Manchukuo in 1939, following the Nomonhan Incident. In March 1940, Hanaya was promoted to major general and was given command of the IJA 29th Infantry Brigade. He subsequently served as commander of the infantry group of the IJA 29th Infantry Division in 1941, before being promoted to chief-of-staff of the IJA 1st Army in December 1941. He was promoted to lieutenant general in October 1943, and was assigned command of the IJA 55th Infantry Division in Burma. This division was heavily involved in combat against the British Army in the Battle of the Admin Box from 5 February to 23 February 1943. His division was also ordered to invade the Akyab region of Burma from 11 January 1944; however, his offensive was destroyed by British reinforcements and air supremacy and retreated to avoid encirclement. In particular, 19 February 1944, the commander of the 112th regiment broke the radio communications and withdrew his remaining men without order. 112th regiment was by that time down to roughly 400 men from original 3000, and was faced by British forces including \\"a hundred\\" of artillery pieces, according to survivor\`s testimony. Hanaya's men counterattacked along the lower Sittang River in May‚ÄìJune 1945, which allowed part of the IJA 25th Army to escape. In July 1945, Hanaya was appointed chief of staff of the IJA 39th Army, which was based in Bangkok. However, only 5 days later he was promoted to chief of staff of the IJA 18th Area Army. Hanaya had a reputation for brutalizing the officers under his command, and was universally hated, maintaining his position despite of numerous complaints only due direct support from Hideki Tojo. His methods featured extremely foul language, arbitrary beating (he was cited to say \\"I beat you because you are easy victim\\"), ordering ill soldiers out of hospital, and multiple forced suicides of subordinated officers. He was also one of the first to accept the announcement by Emperor Hirohito ending the war. In the immediate post-war era, Hanaya was active in ultra-rightist organizations (acting independently), and published his memoirs on the Manchurian Incident in 1955. Then ill, customary fundraising among former subordinates failed to attract even a single donations, and his funeral was shunned by community. References Allen, Louis. 1984.

The story and screenplay were written by the latter. The film features Shivaji Dev, Shilpa Bhatt and Anusha Varma in the lead roles and is about finding a ray of light amidst a cloud of gloom and depression. The film was produced by the twin sisters Aruna Guhan and Aparna Guhan under AVM Productions. Filmed by Saleem Bilal and edited by Anil Krishnan, the film features music by Umashankar and lyrics written by Manivannan and Sathyaseelan Rajendran. It is touted to be the first Indian studio-backed film to be made exclusively for the Internet. Made as a direct-to-stream video, the film was released in YouTube on 14 April 2014, which marks the New Year in Tamil calendar.  Plot  The film starts off on a tragic note and travels back and forth to then and now. Gautam (Shivaji Dev), a young man in his late twenties, and his fianc√©e in the U.S., Ramya (Shilpa Bhatt), exchange endearments at midnight little aware of the disaster that is to strike in a few hours. The next morning, he finds out that she has met with an accident and succumbed to her injuries. It isn‚Äôt easy for Gautam to come out of the trauma that hits him hard.  Cast  * Shivaji Dev as Gautam * Ravi Raghavendra as Kumar, Gautam's father * Shilpa Bhatt as Ramya * Anusha Varma as Divya * Berkin Johns as Mani, Gautam's brother * Anjali Aneesh Upasana as Deepika * Ashok Pandian as Ramya's father * Anu Chandrasekaran as the gynecologist  Production  Established by A. V. Meiyappan in 1945, AVM Productions is one of the oldest surviving film studios in Asia. Twins Aruna Guhan and Aparna Guhan, the great granddaughters of Meiyappan and the fourth generation scions of AVM Productions (their production house), were interested in film production. For their first production venture, they went through several scripts for more than six months but were not satisfied with them. When they saw Kasappu Inippu (Bitter Sweet), a ten-minute short film on YouTube, they were impressed. The short was directed by Srihari Prabaharan, a software engineer working for Wipro. The sisters invited him to narrate a script which they eventually liked. They settled for the story line as they felt it was simple, yet strong and poignant. Thus, they zeroed in on the debutant directors Srihari and his friend Anil Krishnan. A \\"feel-good movie\\", the film deals with the \\"vicissitudes of emotions involving love\\". Aruna revealed in an interview that it was a story about finding hope. The film was hence titled Idhuvum Kadandhu Pogum which roughly translates to Even This Will Pass. The film, which has a runtime of about 55 minutes, was meant to last between 45 minutes and an hour as the directors felt that anything longer will make it drag. Shying away from stretching the film any longer, Aparna disclosed, \\"[...] If you drag it a little more, if you try to make it two-and-a-half hours or three hours, you will lose the essence of the story.\\" Apart from the twins, the credits for production is shared by M. Saravanan and M. S. Guhan, their grand father and father respectively. It is the 177th film to be produced by AVM. Realizing that they have fans across the world, they planned to create content for the online platform as they felt Internet was a strong medium to connect with fans. The film exclusively targets the Internet audience and marks AVM's foray into the digital domain with \\"net flicks\\". It is the first studio-backed short film made exclusively for the Internet. Speaking of the motive behind releasing the film on the internet, Aruna felt that internet was a medium which needs to be harnessed properly and expressed hope that this would go a long way in achieving it. She was quoted saying, \\"This may be an experimental effort, but we perceive the internet as a medium of the future.\\" The entire cast and crew are made up of youngsters and newcomers. Shivaji Dev, grandson of late yesteryear actor Sivaji Ganesan, was chosen to play the protagonist. The film also features Ravi Raghavendra and Shilpa Bhatt in key roles. AVM tweeted through their official Twitter handle that Shivaji Dev was not allowed to sleep for more than 30 hours to get dark circles for his role. Beside producing, Aruna worked on the film's title design and was also the costume designer for the film. Filming commenced and though it was expected to be wrapped up in five days, the shoot lasted 12 days. Although essentially a short feature film, the producers decided to go the whole hog, as they would have for a full-length movie, and did colour correction, EFX and Qube. After four months of production, the film was officially announced in November 2013. The film was made on a shoe-string budget. It was initially estimated to cost about 10 lakhs. Following the completion of the film, an audit was conducted to estimate expenses and was found to be around 20 lakhs, as informed by sources close to AVM.  Release  On 22 November 2013, the film was screened in AVM Studios in the presence of M. Saravanan, M. S. Guhan and veteran director S. P. Muthuraman. The producers announced they were targeting YouTube, Amazon, Netflix and other online portals to release the film. The film was released in YouTube on 14 April 2014 coinciding with the Tamil New Year's day. Though initially available for view only in India, the film was slated to be made available for the overseas market after a month. The producers revealed that while viewing online, the film will have two or three one-minute ads in between. The ads were sold through an auction. However, the video was found to have around seven ads with 15‚Äì30 seconds duration each. While the film was first released on the internet, it will also be marketed for television. The production house will tie-up with satellite TV channels in a bid to recover the production cost. = Critical response = In her review, Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu wrote that with a story that has substance, a natural treatment and decent performances of the cast, the film should do well. She praised Dev for his performance stating he had shown he can pull both subdued and vociferous emotions with √©lan. She also added that Ravi Raghavendar gave a standout performance with his \\"excellent underplay\\". While hailing the spontaneity of the characters in their display of emotion, she was critical of the narrative and felt that a lag set in halfway through. Writing for The Hindu, Udhav Naig called the film \\"an optimistic tale of finding love again\\". Lauding that Shivaji Dev had delivered a dignified performance without melodrama, he also noted that the directors had demonstrated a good understanding of short film grammar by keeping the scenes tight. He also felt that the film has been made without a compromise and has a heart of its own. = Accolades = S. P. Muthuraman, who found the film heart-warming, remarked that the performances of the cast were on par with those of experienced actors. Acclaiming Saleem Bilal for his \\"beautiful\\" cinematography, he also said that music was a strong point as it suited the mood throughout the film.
