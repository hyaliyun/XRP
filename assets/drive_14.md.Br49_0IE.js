His father Ildebrando Zacchini invented the compressed-air cannon used to propel humans in circus acts. He was known for being a daredevil and a painter. Biography He was born on October 20, 1898 in Santa Ana, Peru to Maddelen and Ildebrando Zacchini. He held two engineering degrees from the University of Florida. The Zacchini family was originally from Italy, and has performed in various circuses for several generations. Ildebrando Zacchini's circus was touring Peru at the time of Hugo's birth. Hugo grew up in his father's circus, where he learned to perform juggling, trapeze and other circus acts. The famous Zacchini cannon was designed in 1922 by Hugo's father Ildebrando, with the help of Hugo and his brothers Edmondo and Bruno. The cannon act was first performed publicly on the Zacchini Circus while performing in Egypt. In 1928 while Hugo was performing his cannon act in Copenhagen, Denmark, he was discovered by circus owner John Ringling, who offered Zacchini a contract with the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. Zacchini was involved with a lawsuit that made it before the U.S. Supreme Court, Zacchini v. Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co., a case which he ultimately won in 1977. Zacchini sued Scripps-Howard, the owner of an Ohio television station, when it filmed, and then broadcast Zacchini's entire act of being shot out of a cannon at the Geauga County Fair in Burton, Ohio. The United States Supreme Court sided with Zacchini, ruling 5 to 4 that his personality rights overrode the First Amendment rights in this case where the entire act was shown on television in violation of his common law copyright. Although best known as the \\"human cannonball\\", Zacchini was also an accomplished artist. He studied art at the Rome Arts Academy in Italy and received a Master's in Art degree from Jamestown Academy in Jamestown, New York.

In general these compounds are structural analogous to related hydrocarbon ethers, but they exhibit also the distinctive properties of fluorocarbons. The introduction of an ether function to a perfluoro-polymer chain also provides thermoplastic properties to the polymer and makes possible its thermal forming. It is a great technological advantage for producing a large variety of shapes (e.g., beakers, funnels, flasks for laboratory uses, etc...) and to extrude highly chemically resistant tubings. It also confers to the polymer a translucent appearance. Low molecular weight fluorinated ethers PFA tubing is commonly used to handle aggressive chemicals Nafion is a fluoroether with a strongly acidic sulfonic acid substituents Acyclic perfluoroethers are known, e.g. O(C2F5)2, the analogue of diethylether. More interesting and more useful are the cyclic ethers, especially, the epoxides. Thus tetrafluoroethyene oxide and hexafluoropropylene oxide are two of the simplest cyclic perfluoroethers. It is a precursor to perfluoro(methyl vinyl ether) (CF2=CFOCF3) and perfluoro(propyl vinyl ether) are used as a comonomers with tetrafluoroethylene. Polymeric perfluoroethers Perfluoroalkoxy alkanes (PFAs) are fluoropolymers with properties similar to polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). Methylfluoroalkoxy (MFA) is a polytetrafluoroethylene perfluoro methylvinylether prepared with a different ratio of PTFE and MVE monomers than for PFA. In these materials, the ether groups are pendant from the polymer backbone. Krytox is a grease generated by the polymerization of hexafluoropropylene oxide. Their chemical formula is F−(CF(CF3)−CF2−O)n−CF2CF3. The ether groups are integral to the polymer chain. Nafion is a perfluorinated polyether with pendant sulfonic acid groups (RSO3H).

Only one example was built, the prototype (MM.543). While the SM.89 is sometimes described as a \\"bomber\\", its primary armament was to be two 37 mm cannons 54 calibers long. As a result, it appears to have been more akin to contemporary, ground attack/maritime strike aircraft, such as the Bristol Beaufighter or Douglas A-26 Invader. The prototype made its first flight in September 1941, at Vergiate, with test pilot Lieutenant G. Algarotti at the controls. Development The SM.89 was intended to be a bomber/attack aircraft, something similar to Junkers Ju 88. The aircraft displayed some impressive features, but it was not a new project, rather an extrapolation from the earlier SM.84. The project utilized the wings, the aft fuselage and the mixed construction of the latter almost untouched, with a totally redesigned nose. The fuselage was made from a skeleton of steel tubes, covered with duralumin and wood back as far as the dorsal turret, the remainder of the fuselage being of wood and fabric construction. The wing was made of wood using three spars and a covering of compensate wood. The control surfaces comprised slats and flaps, and the ailerons, that were lowered partially with the flaps to increase lift. The forward fuselage was the real difference between the SM.84 and SM.89. The forward fuselage housed only one pilot, after him there was a radio operator/gunner, and finally a gunner. Therefore, the aircraft had only half a crew, compared to the S.84. The fuselage was much more cramped than the S.84's, this was also due to the tandem position for all the crew, because a smaller crew area meant that less protection was needed. The aircraft did not have a nose engine, unlike many contemporary Italian designs. The SM.89 was a two-engine aircraft so that the nose could be used to house weapons. The nose section was rounded, short, and inclined sharply to provide good visibility for attacks on surface targets. The weaponry was mainly based on the 37 mm (1.46 in) Breda anti-aircraft guns, used in the anti-tank and anti-ship roles. Three 12.7 mm (.50 in) Breda machine guns were also fitted in the nose. A further Breda machine gun was also fitted in the dorsal turret, and another was in a new model turret, a remote-controlled one, in the ventral position. The aircraft could carry 700 bomblets or 1,400 kg (3,090 lb) of bombs or torpedoes under the belly. The aircraft could also be fitted with air brakes for dive bombing. The aircraft's speed also made it possible to use the aircraft as a bomber interceptor, however it was never fitted with a radar. The Piaggio P.XI engines were too weak for the aircraft, so instead, two Piaggio P.XII RC.35 were used. These could develop 1,119 kW (1,500 hp) at take-off. These engines were in a more compact installation than those of the Piaggio P.108s and CANT Z.1018s. The aircraft could also carry 2,700 L (710 US gal) of fuel in self-sealing fuel tanks, which gave the aircraft an effective range of 720 km (450 mi). The SM.89 had very heavy armour protection. The armour for the front and windscreen totalled 300 kg (660 lb), another 300 kg (660 lb) of armour protected the engines, and a further 80 kg (180 lb) was used in the aft armour. The aircraft was also possibly equipped with a CO² fire extinguisher system. Operational service The aircraft flew in 1941, but it was not until September 1942 that it was sent to Guidonia for evaluation tests. The aircraft was taken into use in March 1943, seeing service in the anti-tank and other roles. The results were quite good, with its firepower second only to the P.108A. The real problem with the S.89 was the power and the reliability of the engines. 2,237 kW (3,000 hp) was not enough for the 12,600 kg (27,780 lb) aircraft. It was planned to install Piaggio P.XV or Alfa Romeo 135 engines on the aircraft, but this never took place. The pilots found the aircraft to be difficult to fly, being too slow, and difficult to land. During flight, the aircraft needed to have an elevated angle of attack so as not to lose altitude. The aircraft was later forgotten and sent to Foligno in July 1943. It was captured by the Germans after 8 September 1943 and vanished. The aircraft could possibly have been more successful had it carried less weapons or armour. Both combined caused the weight to surpass 12,000 kg (26,460 lb). The attempt to cover both the attack and even interception requirements made this aircraft even less reliable and flyable than the already mediocre S.84.

University of Toronto Law Journal, 51 (2001), 243-271. A concern that previously public information will become privatized and inaccessible to the public when a government agency moves to contract out services to third-party vendors arises whether the third-party vendor is a non-profit organization or a for-profit organization. However, a number of key court cases in this area have arisen when non-profits have rebuffed requests for information under a state's right-to-know laws. Key court cases (U.S.A.)  =Friends of Piedmont Park v. The Piedmont Park Conservancy= The Piedmont Park Conservancy is a private non-profit that oversees and manages Piedmont Park. In 2007, when the organization moved forward with a plan to install a controversial parking structure, a group opposed to the plan—Friends of Piedmont Park—filed an open record request under Georgia's open records legislation for records of the Conservancy. The request was declined, and the Friends group sued. On September 12, 2007, a Georgia judge ruled that the records must be made public.http://www.ajc.com/opinion/content/opinion/stories/2007/09/13/piedmonted_0914.html =The Times of Trenton v. Lafayette Yard Community Development Corp.= In this case, the New Jersey Supreme Court unanimously ruled in 2005 that Lafayette Yard CDC, a private non-profit, was subject to the provisions of New Jersey's open records (OPRA) legislation because it issued city-backed bonds and the majority of its board was appointed by the city council of Trenton. The litigation arose because the board of Lafayette Yard CDC kicked a reporter for the Trenton newspaper out of a meeting on the grounds that, as a private non-profit, they were not subject to open records or open meetings laws. =Gannon and Nichols v. the Board of Regents of the State of Iowa= In this 2005 case, the Iowa Supreme Court overturned a lower court and ruled that outsourcing a public function to a private board does not privatize the records of the private board. The court wrote, \\"In this appeal, we are asked to decide whether a government body may outsource one of its core functions to a private corporation, making that part of its operation nongovernmental and not subject to public scrutiny. We hold the Iowa State University Foundation, a recipient of such outsourcing, is performing a government function, and therefore its records are subject to disclosure.\\" =Kimberly Kay Allen v. John Day= Fourteen cheerleaders sued Powers Management, a private company that ran a public stadium in Nashville, Tennessee, on the grounds that their privacy had been violated by two employees of Powers Management. Powers Management reached an out-of-court settlement with the cheerleaders. The Tennessean asked for a copy of the settlement from Powers, on the grounds that Powers was functionally a government agency. In 2006, a Tennessee appeals court agreed with The Tennessean, ordering Powers to turn over a copy of the settlement to the newspaper. Current controversies =Downtown Vision in Jacksonville, Florida= Downtown Vision agreed in September 2007 that it falls under Florida's open records law.

However, the Charleston Area Alliance has refused to provide information about the salaries its officers receive, on the grounds that it is a private organization.http://sundaygazettemail.com/section/News/200705043 =Medicaid service non-profits in Connecticut= In Connecticut, the state Department of Social Services contracted with three for-profit companies and one non-profit company for Medicaid services. Each organization refused to respond to Connecticut open records requests for information about how much they were paying doctors under the plans. The Connecticut Attorney General and Connecticut Freedom of Information Coalition ruled that the documents must be made public. =New Mexico State University Foundation= In New Mexico, the non-profit New Mexico State University Foundation is claiming that because it is private, it doesn't have to release the names of donors, even though the donors are partially funding the salaries of employees at New Mexico State University. Basketball coach Reggie Theus is one recipient of a salary partially funded by undisclosed private donors. Since Theus has spoken at a public governmental hearing in favor of a private real-estate development, questions have arisen about whether he is receiving part of his salary from those real estate developers.

Ascella was named after Ascella, a star in the constellation Sagittarius. She was responsible for delivering troops, goods and equipment to locations in the Asiatic-Pacific Theater. Construction Ascella was laid down 7 January 1943, under a Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MC hull No. 708, as the Liberty ship SS George C. Yount, by California Shipbuilding Corporation, Terminal Island, Los Angeles, California; launched 4 February 1943; sponsored by Mrs. E. Rickenbacker; acquired by the Navy 30 November 1943; renamed Ascella 14 December 1943; converted by the Matson Navigation Company, San Francisco, California; and commissioned at Hunters Point, 7 January 1944, Lieutenant Commander Alexander Kusebach, USNR in command.  Service history  Two days after commissioning, the cargo ship arrived at the Naval Supply Depot, Oakland, California, to load stores, provisions, and ammunition. Following brief shakedown training, she departed San Francisco, California, on 21 January. Nine days later, Ascella entered port at Pearl Harbor and began discharging her cargo. = Delivering supplies to troops in the South Pacific = On 3 February, she shifted berths and began loading supplies bound for the US Army occupation garrison on newly won Kwajalein in the Marshall Islands. A week later, the vessel put to sea and, after a nine- day voyage, entered the lagoon at Kwajalein. She spent the remainder of February unloading her cargo before departing Kwajalein on 3 March. After interrupting her voyage at Pearl Harbor to drop off three landing craft for repairs, the ship returned to the Naval Supply Depot, Oakland, on 23 March. There she took on another load of supplies, embarked 83 Navy men for passage to Hawaii, and stood out of San Francisco Bay. She entered Pearl Harbor on 10 April, and began a four-day visit during which her passengers disembarked and she loaded ammunition and armory equipment. On 14 April, Ascella set sail for the Marshall Islands with another 44 passengers embarked. = Replenishing Fifth Fleet ships = Upon her arrival in Majuro lagoon, the cargo ship began replenishing the warships of Task Force (TF) 58. During her sojourn there, she also provided berthing spaces for her officer passengers until the middle of the first week in May. On 6 June, she took on board 47 U.S. Marines for passage to Roi Island at Kwajalein, where the ship remained and loaded defective ammunition and empty shell cases until 21 June. On that day, Ascella embarked 51 Navy passengers and weighed anchor for Hawaii. She stopped at Oahu from 30 June to 3 July, to debark 24 of her passengers and unload her cargo. Another eight days at sea preceded her 11 July, arrival back at San Francisco. = Supporting Central Pacific bases = After disembarking the remaining 27 passengers, the ship started loading dry stores and provisions bound for the fleet in the Central Pacific. She got underway on 24 July, and reached Pearl Harbor on 1 August. During the next two days, the cargo ship debarked passengers and took on mail bound for the Central Pacific. Returning to sea on 3 August, Ascella resumed the voyage west and stood into the lagoon at Eniwetok Atoll on 15 August, for a month's visit. In addition to serving as station stores ship issuing supplies to various units of the fleet, she also provided berthing spaces for transient sailors. After transferring what remained of her cargo to on 11 September, Ascella embarked 53 hospital patients for transportation to Hawaii on 16 September, and began the voyage that same day. She reached Pearl Harbor on 25 September, exchanged her patient-passengers for 56 California-bound sailors, and continued on her way on 27 September. On 6 October, the ship pulled into San Pedro, California, and disembarked her passengers. = New Guinea operations = Three weeks of voyage repairs and cargo loading operations followed her return to the California coast. She got underway again on 27 October, to carry supplies, this time to the fleet in the southwestern Pacific. Ascella made a stop at Pearl Harbor to take on fuel and water before continuing on to her first destination, Finschhafen, New Guinea. She arrived at that port on 23 November, but remained only a few hours. Two days later, the cargoman hauled into Seeadler Harbor at the island of Manus in the Admiralties. Her stay there brought more provisioning duty and lasted until 15 December. On that day, the ship cleared Manus for a run to the Palaus and the Carolines. = New Zealand operations = Following stops at Kossol Passage and at Ulithi, she departed the latter port on 10 January 1945, and shaped a course for New Zealand. Ascella moored at Princess Dock, Auckland, on 24 January. Another consignment of general stores and provisions hoisted on board, she steamed out of Auckland on 1 February. The cargo ship delivered supplies to Nouméa, New Caledonia, between 5 and 9 February, and, with another group of passengers embarked, resumed her voyage. Ascella entered Seeadler Harbor once more on 16 February, and discharged supplies and passengers. Having exchanged one group of passengers for another, the ship returned to sea on 24 February. = Her last assignment of the war = Ascella and her passengers were bound for the same duty station, Ulithi Atoll in the Carolines. They arrived there on 28 February, and the cargo ship began her last assignment of World War II. Throughout the final campaigns -- Okinawa and the US 3rd Fleet–US 5th Fleet air assault on the Japanese home islands—the cargo ship remained at Ulithi issuing stores and provisions to the warships prosecuting those actions. One mission—a round-trip voyage from Ulithi to Pearl Harbor and back in late July and early August—interrupted her service in the lagoon. Her assignment as station stores ship at Ulithi ended nine days after the formal surrender of Japan. = End-of-war operations = On that day, 11 September 1945, she weighed anchor for similar duty at Okinawa in the Ryukyu Islands. After duty at Okinawa from 16 September to 23 October, Ascella moved on to Samar in the central Philippines where she issued stores and provisions from 5 November to 24 December. Forced to get underway on Christmas Eve Day, she celebrated the holiday at sea before entering Shanghai, China, on 30 December 1945. The cargo ship served as an accommodation ship at Shanghai through the first week of April 1946. On 10 April, she departed Shanghai and headed for the Marianas. Ascella performed some unspecified duty at Guam for about three weeks between 16 April and 5 May.  Post-war assignments  On the latter day, the ship weighed anchor and set sail for the United States. Following 18 days at sea, she arrived back in San Francisco on 22 May. Later, she moved to Stockton, California, where she loaded provisions before getting underway on 29 June, for Hawaii. She arrived in the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard on 6 July, and began inactivation procedures. Ascella was placed out of commission at Pearl Harbor on 13 August 1946.  Post-war decommissioning  There, she remained until the spring of 1947, when she was towed to San Francisco, to be returned to MARCOM. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 22 May 1947, her name was reverted to her merchant name, George C. Yount. She was transferred to MARCOM for layup with the National Defense Reserve Fleet, Suisun Bay Group, Benicia, California, 28 May 1947. Fate On 7 July 1964, she was sold to National Metal & Steel Corporation, for $49,653.18, to be scrapped. She was removed from the fleet 27 July 1964.

It serves the MBTA Orange Line, and is located below grade at Boylston Street in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood. The station opened on May 4, 1987 as part of the Southwest Corridor project, replacing an earlier station that was open from 1897 to 1940. History Boylston station around 1910 An Orange Line train at Stony Brook in 2016 Starting in 1891, the Old Colony Railroad (acquired in 1893 by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad) raised the section of its main line through Jamaica Plain (extending from Massachusetts Avenue to the current location of Forest Hills station) onto a 4-track stone embankment to eliminate dangerous grade crossings. The project involved the replacement of the three NYNH&H; stations in Roxbury and Jamaica Plain (at Roxbury Crossing, Jamaica Plain, and Forest Hills) with elevated stations, and the construction of two new stations at Heath Street and Boylston Street. Boylston Street station opened on June 1, 1897, along with the other four new and rebuilt stations. On November 22, 1909, the Washington Street Elevated was extended south from (now Nubian Square) to Forest Hills. Although the five NYNH&H; stations in Roxbury and Jamaica Plain continued to operate for over three decades following the southward extension of the Washington Street Elevated, they were ultimately unable to compete with the Elevated, and all, including Boylston Street, were closed on September 29, 1940 due to a lack of passengers. In the 1960s, plans took hold to extend I-95 into downtown Boston along the NYNH&H;'s right-of-way and to replace the Washington Street Elevated (after 1967 known as the Orange Line) with a rapid transit line running in the new highway's median. Although the project was halted by highway revolts in 1969 and the February 11, 1970 announcement by Governor Francis W. Sargent of a moratorium on new highway construction within the Route 128 corridor, and eventually cancelled by Governor Sargent in 1972, the right-of-way had already been cleared. This empty strip of land (known as the Southwest Corridor) was eventually developed into the Southwest Corridor Park, and the Orange Line was moved to a new alignment along the Corridor in 1987 despite the cancellation of the project originally calling for its relocation. This included a new rapid transit station at Boylston Street, on the site of the former NYNH&H; station, named Stony Brook after the former watercourse of the same name. (The name was determined in 1985 as part of a series of station name changes. ) The Washington Street Elevated was permanently closed on April 30, 1987, and the new southern half of the Orange Line, including Stony Brook, opened on May 4. Since the route 48 bus was discontinued on July 1, 2012, Stony Brook has no bus connections. Jackson Square, the next stop to the north, is a major bus transfer station.

The concept was introduced by John Rushby in a 1981 paper.John Rushby, \\"The Design and Verification of Secure Systems,\\" Eighth ACM Symposium on Operating System Principles, pp. 12-21, Asilomar, CA, December 1981. (ACM Operating Systems Review, Vol. 15, No. 5). Rushby proposed the separation kernel as a solution to the difficulties and problems that had arisen in the development and verification of large, complex security kernels that were intended to \\"provide multilevel secure operation on general-purpose multi-user systems.\\" According to Rushby, \\"the task of a separation kernel is to create an environment which is indistinguishable from that provided by a physically distributed system: it must appear as if each regime is a separate, isolated machine and that information can only flow from one machine to another along known external communication lines. One of the properties we must prove of a separation kernel, therefore, is that there are no channels for information flow between regimes other than those explicitly provided.\\" A variant of the separation kernel, the partitioning kernel, has gained acceptance in the commercial aviation community as a way of consolidating, onto a single processor, multiple functions, perhaps of mixed criticality. Commercial real-time operating system products in this genre have been used by aircraft manufacturers for safety-critical avionics applications. In 2007 the Information Assurance Directorate of the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) published the Separation Kernel Protection Profile (SKPP),Information Assurance Directorate, National Security Agency, Fort George G. Meade, MD. \\"U.S. Government Protection Profile for Separation Kernels in Environments Requiring High Robustness,\\" Version 1.03, June 2007. a security requirements specification for separation kernels suitable to be used in the most hostile threat environments. The SKPP describes, in Common Criteria\\"Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation,\\" Version 3.1, CCMB-2006-09-001, 002, 003, September 2006. parlance, a class of modern products that provide the foundational properties of Rushby's conceptual separation kernel. It defines the security functional and assurance requirements for the construction and evaluation of separation kernels while yet providing some latitude in the choices available to developers. The SKPP defines separation kernel as \\"hardware and/or firmware and/or software mechanisms whose primary function is to establish, isolate and separate multiple partitions and control information flow between the subjects and exported resources allocated to those partitions.\\" Further, the separation kernel's core functional requirements include: * protection of all resources (including CPU, memory and devices) from unauthorized access * separation of internal resources used by the Target of Evaluation Security Functions (TSF) from exported resources made available to subjects * partitioning and isolation of exported resources * mediation of information flows between partitions and between exported resources * audit services > The separation kernel allocates all exported resources under its control > into partitions. The partitions are isolated except for explicitly allowed > information flows. The actions of a subject in one partition are isolated > from (viz., cannot be detected by or communicated to) subjects in another > partition, unless that flow has been allowed. The partitions and flows are > defined in configuration data. Note that 'partition' and 'subject' are > orthogonal abstractions.

In September 2008, INTEGRITY-178B from Green Hills Software became the first separation kernel certified against the SKPP.http://www.niap-ccevs.org/cc- scheme/st/st_vid10119-st.pdf Wind River Systems has separation kernel technology that was in active certification process in 2009. Lynx Software Technologies has a separation kernel, LynxSecure. In 2011, the Information Assurance Directorate sunset the SKPP. NSA will no longer certify specific operating systems, including separation kernels against the SKPP, noting \\"conformance to this protection profile, by itself, does not offer sufficient confidence that national security information is appropriately protected in the context of a larger system in which the conformant product is integrated\\".https://www.niap-ccevs.org/pp/archived/PP_SKPP_HR_V1.03/ The seL4 microkernel has a formal proof that it can be configured as a separation kernel.https://github.com/seL4/l4v/blob/master/proof/bisim/Syscall_S.thy The proof of information flow enforcementhttps://www.nicta.com.au/publications/research- publications/?pid=6464 together with this implies a very high level of assurance for that usecase.

They also have small factions in rural and suburban Chicago, and are believed to have spread to many other states. They are allies of the larger and more notorious gangs, the Aryan Brotherhood and the Mexican Mafia and fellow peckerwood gang Public Enemy No. 1. Their main rivals are the Bloods, the Crips, the Black Guerrilla Family, MS-13, Norteños, and Nuestra Familia. The Nazi Low Riders operate in and outside prison walls. They are often fueled by their drug of choice, methamphetamine.Finnegan, William (December 1, 1997) \\"A Reporter at Large: The Unwanted\\" The New YorkerValdemar, Richard (February 1, 2008) \\"The Rise and Fall of the Nazi Low Riders\\" Police: The Magazine for CopsStaff (ndg) \\"Nazi Low Riders (NLR)\\" Anti- Defamation LeagueMorales, Gabe (ndg) \\"Gang Profiles: Nazi Lowriders\\" Criminal Justice Solutions, LLC NLR violence has struck the general public, including police officers.  History  The gang originated in the mid to late 1970s from the Aryan Brotherhood, but was not really noticed by law enforcement until the early 1990s, by which time the California authorities had been cracking down on the Brotherhood. As opposed to other white criminal gangs in California prisons, the NLR gained a reputation for being very violent. They are labeled as a prison gang by the California Department of Corrections. They are strong in numbers in such California communities as Oildale, Bakersfield, Lancaster, Inland Empire, Rosamond and Orange County. The \\"Nazi\\" part of their name is more a sign of a racist belief in white supremacy than anti-Semitism, while \\"Lowriders\\" is a play on the term used for Hispanic gangs. The gang eventually progressed from being muscle for the Brotherhood to a fast-growing gang in their own right. Unlike other white supremacist gangs in the US, they appear to be well organized and have developed links with other white organizations throughout the West Coast, including the Ku Klux Klan. Paroled gang members have been known to move east to further spread the organization's reach. On January 28, 1999, California prison officials recognized the Lowriders as a prison gang. Consequently, in an attempt to disrupt the gang's criminal activities, inmates known to be members can now be subjected to removal from the general population, as well as other restrictive treatments. To this, the Lowriders have responded by striking an alliance with Public Enemy No. 1, another white disruptive group, which has since taken over the reins on California's white mainline prison population. Where Aryan Brotherhood and NLR have left off, PENI or Public Enemy No. 1 (Pronounced 'PEE NYE') plan to continue the 'key holding'.  Organization and members  In prison, the Nazi Lowriders have a three-tier hierarchy system consisting of senior members, junior members, and kids. The seniors typically lead the gang. For senior status, gang members must have been active for at least five years and been elected by at least three other senior members. Below them are juniors, who cannot themselves induct new members but can attempt to recruit potentials. Kids usually come from gangs like Public Enemy No.1, and the senior member who inducts them becomes their mentor. On the streets, the organization structure is not so clear, and appears to be more loosely connected. Gang members may have tattoos and other body art depicting swastikas and SS sigrunes, although members are not necessarily required to bear them. A tattoo of the letters NLR (the acronym for \\"Nazi Lowriders\\") commonly appears on members' stomachs, backs or necks. Other popular tattoos include \\"Nazi Low Riders\\" written in Old English script or the runic alphabet. The logo of the NLR is a skeletal eagle holding a Nazi swastika, with the letters of the group based on the Reichsadler symbol. According to the SPLC, despite the NLR's avowed racism, they seem to accept their members having Latino wives and girlfriends. In fact, much of the NLR's upper echelon is composed of Hispanics. Due to their extreme underground ties with other hardcore, racial organizations (such as Combat 18 Blood and Honour), experts say, \\"you must be at least half white blood but no black blood\\", meaning accepted Latino members must be only of Spanish descent, or be at least half Caucasian. All must show loyalty to the white race and subscribe to an ideology of hatred, especially against blacks and \\"race traitors\\".  Criminal activity  The organization is involved in criminal activity both in and out of prison, notably in the production and distribution of methamphetamine, and has become a distributor of the drug in Southern California.Rosenzweig, David (August 3, 2000) \\"Federal Prosecutors Target Prison Gang in Drug Crackdown\\" Los Angeles Times This gang is responsible for dozens of assaults, attempted murders, and murders around Southern California and is considered an extremely dangerous and violent gang.Hayes, Dade (October 28, 1997) \\"Man Pleads Guilty to Racial Assaults\\" Los Angeles TimesRosenzweig, David (June 8, 1999) \\"Skinhead Gang Member Sentenced in Hate Crimes\\" Los Angeles TimesLarubbia, Evelyn (October 29, 1997) \\"Supremacists Charged With Racial Murder\\" Los Angeles TimesDaldez, A.

Members will often protect and defend young, even if not of direct genetic linkage. Circulus is a Latin based term; one definition of the word is \\"a social gathering or circle company\\".Andrews,E.A; 1875. Latin-English Lexicon. Harper & Brothers publishers, 329 & 331 Pearl Street, Franklin Square, New York, U.S.A. 1663 pp. Most reptiles are indifferent socially to each other as adults or to offspring. Behaviours Among crocodilians and certain lizards, there is a much greater interaction between members. Young will be guarded and defended for a considerable period of time. Crocodilians of both sexes carry and assist young hatchlings to the water and guard them. The gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) has to nudge young to the water because their teeth are too sharp to carry them. Sub-adult members of a crocodilian social group will often stand by a female laying eggs or retrieving young from a nest to keep predators away. The female Asian forest tortoise (Manouria emys) has been reported to guard a nest site for a short period after egg laying but this instinct is very short lived. In stump-tailed skinks (Tiliqua rugosa) and Solomon Islands skinks (Corucia spp), long term bonding of pairs with each other and other members has been recorded. In the case of Corucia, orphaned young have been observed being adopted into the circulus. The social bond and parental attention of reptiles appears equal in circulus containing egg-laying reptiles compared to those with live bearing reptiles. Another case of egg- laying lizards with a circulus is the red-eyed crocodile skink (Tribolonotus gracilis). The female will sit on the egg and guard the young. As in the case of Corucia, the young tend to stay close to the parents, especially, the mother who guards the neonate. The young skink will often climb on the abaxial area of the female or male for protection and security, just as in the case of the Solomon Islands skink (Corucia zebrata).Jones,Schnirel ;(2006).

It ran for eight years, ending in 1968 and returned as a limited series in 2008. Featuring a combination of fantasy, science fiction and World War II comic motifs, the stories featured a group of American soldiers, stranded on an uncharted island during the Pacific War which they discover is populated by dinosaurs. Publication history The War that Time Forgot was created by writer/editor Robert Kanigher and artists Ross Andru and Mike Esposito in Star Spangled War Stories #90 (May 1960). They continued to compose most of the stories during the comic's run. During its time, it was the main feature of the title. The title and some of the premises might have been influenced by Edgar Rice Burroughs' The Land That Time Forgot, in which soldiers and sailors of World War I are stranded on a dinosaur- haunted land in the Antarctic. The protagonists of the early adventures were not usually recurring, but a few of them appeared more than once. Among them are two soldiers named Larry and Charlie (Star Spangled War Stories #90, 92), the airborne brothers Henry, Steve and Tommy Frank a.k.a. ”The Flying Boots” (Star Spangled War Stories #99–100, 104–105), early prototypes of the G.I. Robot (Star Spangled War Stories #101–103, 125) members of the original Suicide Squad (Star Spangled War Stories #110–111, 116–121, 125, 127–128), sailors PT and Prof (Star Spangled War Stories #110–111) and the flying ace called \\"The Brother With No Wings\\" (Star Spangled War Stories #129, 131). The series ran in Star Spangled War Stories from issue #90 to issue #137 (although issues #91, #93 and #126 did not feature The War That Time Forgot stories). The final story was in the Feb-March 1968 issue of Star Spangled War Stories, afterwards, the Enemy Ace, a German World War I pilot, became the focus of the book and the dinosaur plotline was retired. In 1973, some of these stories were reprinted in Four Star Battle Tales #3 and G.I War Tales issues #1 and #2. The War That Time Forgot re-appeared in the October 1976 issue (#195) of G.I. Combat, featuring the Haunted Tank. In the 1980s, DC briefly revisited The War that Time Forgot in a run as one of the features in Weird War Tales (#100). During the series run in Weird War Tales, Dinosaur Island was visited by the Creature Commandos and the G.I. Robot. This was the World War II version of the Commandos. Dinosaur Island was also featured in Tim Truman's 1998 four-issue mini-series, Guns of the Dragon. The 1920s set mini-series provided sort of an origin story for the island. In Darwyn Cooke's 2003 alternate-universe mini-series DC: The New Frontier, Dinosaur Island was revisited yet again as part of its opening prelude. Here, it is visited by the military team known as The Losers. In May 2008 Bruce Jones launched The War that Time Forgot as a 12-issue limited series, featuring the Enemy Ace, Firehair and Tomahawk on one side and the Golden Gladiator, the Viking Prince and the G.I. Robot on the other. Collections A DC Showcase Presents black and white trade paperback collection, The War that Time Forgot Volume One, was published in 2007.

Earthstar was encouraged by Krautrock/Kosmische Musik/electronic music artist, composer, and producer Klaus Schulze to relocate to Germany where they were signed by Sky Records. Schulze produced their second and most successful album, French Skyline. Earthstar is notable as the only American band who participated in Germany's Kosmische Musik/electronic music scene while still at its height. The Earthstar entry in the New Gibraltar Encyclopedia of Progressive Rock describes the wall of sound on the second and third albums: \\"[Group leader Craig] Wuest's vision propels these two albums, his desire apparently is to create music that doesn't necessarily suggest a particular instrument, rather creates a new texture. Therefore, though there are credits for flute, guitar, bass, violin, viola, French horn, sitar and vocals, it's pretty hard to distinguish any of these...\\" Earthstar's style on French Skyline has been compared to Wolfgang Bock, Sangiuliano, and Klaus Schulze's own recordings. Other albums have a softer style with more distinct instrumentation. Earthstar is also notable for Craig Wuest's heavy use of the Mellotron and the rare Birotron, a variation on the Mellotron that can sustain notes beyond eight seconds.  History  = 1977–1979 (Utica and Moontower) = Earthstar was the brainchild of keyboardist/synthesist Craig Wuest. A native of Utica, New York, Wuest was heavily influenced by the German electronic music scene of the 1970s, including Klaus Schulze, Popol Vuh, Tangerine Dream, Kraftwerk, and Harmonia. Around the same time, Utica guitarist Dennis Rea had founded what he describes as an \\"eccentric progressive rock band,\\" Zuir. According to Rea, \\"...being the only two adventurous music acts in town, collaboration between Craig and the members of Zuir was inevitable.\\" Rea also recalls concerts during the Utica period: \\"The group performed live only a handful of times, mostly at inappropriate venues like roadhouse bars and college beer halls, with predictable results.\\" = 1979–1983 (Germany and Sky) = Craig Wuest was an admirer of electronic music pioneer Klaus Schulze, with whom he struck up a correspondence. Schulze encouraged Wuest and Earthstar to come to Germany, intending to sign them to his Innovative Communications record label. Wuest sold his grand piano, which had played a prominent part on Salterbarty Tales, to finance the move. While much of French Skyline was recorded at Klaus Schulze studios in Hambühren, West Germany, with additional recording taking place at IC Studios in Ovelgönne, Schulze's label never signed Earthstar. The group's next three albums were released by Hamburg-based Sky Records instead, beginning with French Skyline in 1979, which was co-produced by Schulze and Wuest. Schulze's influence on Earthstar and Wuest is clearly heard on French Skyline, with reviewer Victor \\"Philip\\" Parau describing Earthstar at the time as \\"granted a classic place\\" within \\"the Berlin School electronic sessions.\\" Earthstar's second album for Sky, Atomkraft? Nein, Danke! (literally \\"Nuclear power? No, thank you!\\"), was an environmental tone poem. The album was recorded in 1979 and 1980 and was released on February 1, 1981. The Planet Mellotron Web site describes it as \\"more laid back\\" than French Skyline and \\"...an ideal opportunity to hear the rarest tape-replay instrument,\\" the Birotron. A third album for Sky, Humans Only, was recorded in 1981 and released the following year. The album was the result of a partnership between Wuest and Utica-based guitarist and songwriter Dan Hapanowicz. = Later works? = According to Dennis Rea, Earthstar dissolved not long after the release of Humans Only. A now defunct earthstarmusic.com Web site listed three later releases. Axiom, which was listed as following Humans Only, was recorded in Germany in 1980 and the United States in 1984. MP3 samples of the music revealed a conventional, melodic, controlled electronic music sound. By this point Earthstar had become Wuest's solo project, as indicated in the description of the album Big Blue Piano. The website listed both Big Blue Piano and a collection of unreleased material called Eve as having been released by Electronic America Records in 2000. However, no record of the actual release of these later works can be found. After the Earthstar sessions guitarist Dennis Rea moved to Seattle where he met electronic composer Kerry Leimer, who had released a number of albums. Leimer, looking to create danceable electronic music, had formed Savant. Rea joined Savant in 1982, contributing to the album The Neo-Realist (at Risk), described by Downbeat magazine as \\"pan-ethnic techno-dub music\\". In 1983 Rea moved to New York City where he once again worked with former Earthstar member Daniel Zongrone. The pair composed music for an exhibition of painter (and former Earthstar violinist) Daryl Trivieri's work at the Semaphore East Gallery in the East Village in 1985. Rea returned to Seattle in 1986 where he is the sole former Earthstar member still actively recording music. Zongrone recorded a solo album, Absolute Zero, in 1987 and composed the music for the 1998 film The Glasshead. He is currently artist in residence, composing, recording and working with longtime colleague Dennis Rea.

Stronger connexive logics also accept Boethius' Thesis, * ((p → q) → ~(p → ~q)) which states that if a statement implies one thing, it does not imply its opposite. History Connexive logic is arguably one of the oldest approaches to logic. Aristotle's Thesis is named after Aristotle because he uses this principle in a passage in the Prior Analytics. > It is impossible that the same thing should be necessitated by the being and > the not-being of the same thing. I mean, for example, that it is impossible > that B should necessarily be great if A is white, and that B should > necessarily be great if A is not white. For if B is not great A cannot be > white. But if, when A is not white, it is necessary that B should be great, > it necessarily results that if B is not great, B itself is great. But this > is impossible. An. Pr. ii 4.57b3. The sense of this passage is to perform a reductio ad absurdum proof on the claim that two formulas, (A → B) and (~A → B), can be true simultaneously. The proof is, # (A → B) hypothesis # (~A → B) hypothesis # (~B → ~A) 1, Transposition # (~B → B) 2, 3, Hypothetical Syllogism Aristotle then declares step 4 to be impossible, completing the reductio. But if step 4 is impossible, it must be because Aristotle accepts its denial, ~(~B → B), as a logical truth. Aristotelian syllogisms (as opposed to Boolean syllogisms) appear to be based on connexive principles. For example, the contrariety of A and E statements, \\"All S are P,\\" and \\"No S are P,\\" follows by a reductio ad absurdum argument similar to the one given by Aristotle. Later logicians, notably Chrysippus, are also thought to have endorsed connexive principles. By 100 C.E. logicians had divided into four or five distinct schools concerning the correct understanding of conditional (\\"if...then...\\") statements. Sextus Empiricus described one school as follows. > And those who introduce the notion of connexion say that a conditional is > sound when the contradictory of its consequent is incompatible with its > antecedent. The term \\"connexivism\\" is derived from this passage (as translated by Kneale and Kneale). It is believed that Sextus was here describing the school of Chrysippus. That this school accepted Aristotle's thesis seems clear because the definition of the conditional, * (p → q) =df ~(p ° ~q) - where ° indicates compatibility, requires that Aristotle's Thesis be a logical truth, provided we assume that every statement is compatible with itself, which seems fairly fundamental to the concept of compatibility. The medieval philosopher Boethius also accepted connexive principles. In De Syllogismo Hypothetico, he argues that from, \\"If A, then if B then C,\\" and \\"If B then not-C,\\" we may infer \\"not-A,\\" by modus tollens. However, this follows only if the two statements, \\"If B then C,\\" and \\"If B then not-C,\\" are considered incompatible. Since Aristotelian logic was the standard logic studied until the 19th Century, it could reasonably be claimed that connexive logic was the accepted school of thought among logicians for most of Western history. (Of course, logicians were not necessarily aware of belonging to the connexivist school.) However, in the 19th Century Boolean syllogisms, and a propositional logic based on truth-functions, became the standard. Since then, relatively few logicians have subscribed to connexivism. These few include E. J. Nelson and P. F. Strawson. Connecting antecedent to consequent The objection that is made to the truth-functional definition of conditionals is that there is no requirement that the consequent actually follow from the antecedent. So long as the antecedent is false or the consequent true, the conditional is considered to be true whether there is any relation between the antecedent and the consequent or not. Hence, as the philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce once remarked, you can cut up a newspaper, sentence by sentence, put all the sentences in a hat, and draw any two at random. It is guaranteed that either the first sentence will imply the second, or vice versa. But when we use the words \\"if\\" and \\"then\\" we generally mean to assert that there is some relation between the antecedent and the consequent. What is the nature of that relationship? Relevance (or relevant) logicians take the view that, in addition to saying that the consequent cannot be false while the antecedent is true, the antecedent must be \\"relevant\\" to the consequent. At least initially, this means that there must be at least some terms (or variables) that appear in both the antecedent and the consequent. Connexivists generally claim instead that there must be some \\"real connection\\" between the antecedent and the consequent, such as might be the result of real class inclusion relations. For example, the class relations, \\"All men are mortal,\\" would provide a real connection that would warrant the conditional, \\"If Socrates is a man, then Socrates is mortal.\\" However, more remote connections, for example \\"If she apologized to him, then he lied to me,\\" (suggested by Bennett) still defy connexivist analysis.

According to Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation, it is the oldest public school building still standing within the city of Pittsburgh. Exterior Sign, Bedford School, Pittsburgh History Built in the Greek Revival style in 1850, the school opened as Birmingham No. 1, the largest public school on the South Side at the time. It was built to meet the growing need for classroom space in Birmingham, a manufacturing and residential borough that comprised the present South Side Flats between 6th and 17th Streets. Eighty pupils studied in the original four-room building. Boys attended classes on one side; girls on the other. Greek Revival was the predominant architectural style for public buildings and homes built in southwestern Pennsylvania between about 1830 and 1860. Hallmarks of the style used in Bedford School include the pedimented entries with cornice returns and multi-light transoms and sidelights, brick dentils, unornamented lintels, and roof pitch. The inset panels of the second and third-floor windows are similar to features of some other Greek Revival buildings in Pittsburgh from the period. The school was built with a cupola, like many other public schools in Pittsburgh in the mid-19th century. It housed the Birmingham town clock, purchased by the Birmingham Borough Council for $450 in 1850. In 1872 the school joined the Pittsburgh school system, after the city of Pittsburgh annexed Birmingham and other South Side boroughs. The school changed its name to Bedford Public School in honor of Dr. Nathaniel Bedford, a physician at Fort Pitt, thought of as Pittsburgh's first doctor, as well as a large landowner on the South Side. Bedford had laid out streets and lots in Birmingham and named the town in 1811, for his birthplace in Birmingham, England.History of the South Side , from Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation. In his will, he gave the land to the Borough of Birmingham for a school. =Remodeling= A 1912 remodeling of the Bedford School reconfigured the classrooms, adding rooms and corridors. The Pittsburgh Board of Education annual report for 1912 states the following: > This building contained nine class rooms, each 24 ft. x 50 ft. with two > teachers and two classes working in each room. Under these conditions > teaching was almost impossible. The entire interior of the building was > remodeled and contains twelve modern, fully equipped class rooms, properly > connected by corridors. The outside privies were removed and replaced with a > new two-story sanitary tower directly connected with the building. The remodeling included an addition on the 10th Street side of the building. By 1912, Bedford School, under principal E. W. Dalbey of Wilkinsburg, had 14 teachers and 475 students. By 1920 the Bedford School was the oldest public school building in use in the city of Pittsburgh. It operated as an elementary school until 1957, when the Pittsburgh Board of Education closed Bedford School. =Closing= The first floor served as a school for handicapped students until 1960, when the school board sold the building to Rhea S. Plack, wife of Milton Plack of Squirrel Hill, who used it as storage for L & M Sales, his wholesale hardware and contracting supplies firm. In 1997, Milton Plack sold the building to Frontier Lofts of the South Side, which converted it to condominiums under the direction of Pittsburgh real-estate developer Joedda Sampson. Among eight units, several of which have loft space, all have features of the original classrooms, including hardwood flooring and lighting fixtures, and many retain original blackboards.

Cones Athrotaxis selaginoides is a species of Athrotaxis, endemic to Tasmania in Australia, where it grows at 400–1,120 m altitude. In its habitat in the mountains, snow in winter is very usual. It is often called King Billy Pine or King William Pine (believed to be in reference to the Tasmanian aborigine William Lanne), although it is not a true pine.Farjon, A. (2005). Monograph of Cupressaceae and Sciadopitys. Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Description It is an evergreen coniferous tree growing to 20–30 m tall, with a trunk up to 1.5 m diameter. The leaves are claw-like, 7–18 mm long and 3–4 mm broad, arranged spirally on the shoots. The seed cones are globose, 15–30 mm diameter, with 20–30 spirally-arranged scales; they are mature about six months after pollination. The pollen cones are 4–5 mm long. Decline The main cause of past decline has been fire, with about one third of its habitat burnt in the twentieth century. Like the other two Athrotaxis species, A. selaginoides is sensitive to fire. Another cause of past decline has been logging. The overall decline is estimated to be about 40% over the last 200 years. This is within the three generation time limit where one generation is estimated to be at least 100 years. Although 84% of forests are now in protected areas, fires still are a potential hazard. Tasmanian government policy precludes logging of this species in and outside these protected areas. Cultivation Examples of the species can be viewed at The Tasmanian Arboretum.

Shoeshiner or boot polisher is an occupation in which a person cleans and buffs shoes and then applies a waxy paste to give a shiny appearance and a protective coating. They are often known as shoeshine boys because the job was traditionally done by a male child. Other synonyms are bootblack and shoeblack. While the role is denigrated in much of Western civilization, shining shoes is an important source of income for many children and families throughout the world. Some shoeshiners offer extra services, such as shoe repairs and general tailoring. Some well-known people started their working life as shoeshiners, including singers and presidents. History Daguerre, shows a person getting a shoeshine. Shoe polish was not well known as a commercial product until the early 20th century. Throughout the late 19th century shoeshine boys plied their trade on the streets, particularly those in the cities of the United Kingdom. The earliest known daguerreotype (photograph) of a human, View of the Boulevard du Temple, features a man having his shoes shined in the lower corner of the print. Though the image shows Paris' busy Boulevard du Temple, the long exposure time (about ten or twelve minutes) meant that moving traffic cannot be seen; however, the two men at lower left (one apparently having his boots polished by the other) remained still long enough to be distinctly visible.

The play, like the 1939 book on which it is based, was originally titled and performed in the UK as \\"Ten Little Niggers\\". It was also performed under the name Ten Little Indians. Background Christie had been pleased with the book, stating in her autobiography \\"I wrote the book after a tremendous amount of planning, and I was pleased with what I made of it.\\"Christie, Agatha. An Autobiography (Page 471). Collins, 1977. The book was very well received upon publication and Christie received a request from Reginald Simpson to be allowed to dramatise it. Christie refused, because she relished the challenge herselfMorgan, Janet. Agatha Christie, A Biography. (Page 227) Collins, 1984 although it would take her two years to carry out the task. She knew the ending would have to be changed because all of the characters die in the book and therefore \\"I must make two of the characters innocent, to be reunited at the end and come safe out of the ordeal.\\"An Autobiography. (Pages 471–2). The original nursery rhyme that inspired the title had an alternative ending: :\\"He got married and then there were none\\" This allowed Christie to portray a different conclusion on stage.Morgan. (Pages 238–242) After the play had been written, most people she discussed it with considered it impossible to produce. She received some encouragement from Charles Cochrane but he was unable to find financial backers. Finally, Bertie Mayer, who had produced the 1928 play Alibi, agreed to stage it.An Autobiography. (Page 472). After a try- out at the Wimbledon Theatre starting on 20 September 1943, the play opened in the West End at the St James's Theatre on 17 November. It gained good reviews and ran for 260 performances until 24 February 1944 when the theatre was bombed. It then transferred to the Cambridge Theatre opening on 29 February and running at that venue until 6 May. It then transferred back to the restored St James' on 9 May and finally closed on 1 July. Although she did not feel it to be her best play, Christie did declare it was her best piece of \\"craftsmanship\\". She also considered it to be the play which formally started her career as a playwright, despite the success of Black Coffee in 1930.  Scenes  The scene of the play is the living-room of the house on Indian Island (Note: Nigger Island in the 1943 UK production), off the coast of Devon. The time – the present. ACT I *An evening in August ACT II *Scene 1 – The following morning *Scene 2 – The same day. Afternoon ACT III *Scene 1 – The same day. Evening *Scene 2 – The following morning Reception of London production Ivor Brown reviewed the play in The Observer's issue of 21 November 1943 when he said, \\"Miss Agatha Christie does not stint things. Like Hotspur, who could kill six dozen Scots at breakfast, complain of his quiet life, and then ask for work, she is not one to be concerned about a mere singleton corpse. But she can add quality to quantity in her domestic morgue. In Ten Little Niggers she shows an intense ingenuity in adapting that very lethal rhyme (so oddly deemed a nursery matter) to modern conditions.\\" Mr. Brown concluded that Henrietta Watson's portrayal of Emily Brent was, \\"the most authentic member of a house party with 'no future in it. played the airmen say. That gently lugubrious phrase certainly does not hold of the play.\\"The Observer 21 November 1943 (Page 2) =Credits of London production= Director: Irene Hentschel Decor by: Clifford Pember Cast William Murray – Rogers Reginald Barlow – Narracott Hilda Bruce-Potter – Mrs Rogers Linden Travers – Vera Claythorne Terence De Marney – Philip Lombard Michael Blake – Anthony Marston Percy Walsh – William Blore Eric Cowley – General MacKenzie Henrietta Watson – Emily Brent Allan Jeayes – Sir Lawrence Wargarve Gwyn Nicholls – Dr ArmstrongChristie, Agatha.

It was first published in hardback in The Mousetrap and Other Plays by G. P. Putnam's Sons in 1978 () and in the UK by Harper Collins in 1993 (). At some point after the end of the Second World War, a survivor of Buchenwald concentration camp contacted Christie and told her that the inmates had staged their own production there, undoubtedly writing their own script as they would not have had access to the Christie version. Christie was told that they found that it had \\"sustained them\\".Morgan. (Page 266) In November 2007, Lakota East High School in West Chester, OH, was set to perform the play but plans were cancelled after the NAACP protested about the production because of the original title of the novel. Lakota East High School officials subsequently revised their plans and decided to perform the play on 29 November under the title \\"And Then There Were None\\". =2005 production= On 14 October 2005 a new version of play, written by Kevin Elyot and directed by Steven Pimlott opened at the Gielgud Theatre in London. For this version, Elyot returned to the book version of the story and restored the original ending where both Vera and Lombard die and Wargrave commits suicide. The version of the rhyme and island name used was \\"Ten Little Soldiers\\" and \\"Soldier Island\\" as per current printings of the novel.

It is only issued to Swedish citizens, and indicates the citizenship. The card can be used for travelling to and staying in European countries (except Belarus, Russia, and UkraineState Border Guard of Ukraine website accessed 23 October 2016). It can also be used instead of a Swedish passport for entering Dominica (de facto), French overseas territories, Georgia, Montserrat (if in transit to a third country for max 14 days) and on package holidays to Tunisia. However, direct outbound travel from Sweden to non-EU/Schengen territories is not permitted by Swedish border police (other than to the United Kingdom during the Brexit transition period) https://polisen.se/Aktuellt/Nyheter/2015/Juni/Mojligt-att-resa-i-hela-EU-med- nationellt-ID-kort/ The card is often carried by people who often travel internationally, but also the most used card among Swedish citizens who have not yet obtained a driver's license. Price, validity and application procedure The national identity card is valid for five years and costs 400 SEK. Applications are filed at police stations which have a passport office. When applying, a valid Swedish identity document is needed in order to check the identity. If the applicant does not have a valid Swedish identity document, then the applicant must be accompanied in person by another that does have such a document. That person must be a near relative or an employer or municipal official who knows the applicant. There is no age limit to get a card, but people below 18 must be accompanied by their guardian (preferably both) at application. These rules are the same as for a Swedish passport (see that article). Characteristics The identity card is plastic and rectangular in shape, about 86 × 54 millimetres in size. On the left-hand side is a gold-plated contact chip, and on the right-hand side is the photograph of the bearer. Along the top of the card, the name Sweden is written in three languages, Swedish, English, and French (SVERIGE SWEDEN SUÈDE), below which the name of the card is available in the same three languages (Nationellt identitetskort/National identity card/Carte nationale d'identité), followed on the right by the biometric passport symbol (20px) and the nationality of the bearer in Swedish and a country code (SVENSK/SWE). The national identity card is equipped with a contact chip ready to function as an electronic identity card (eID) at a later date, and also a contactless RFID chip at the bottom right of the rear side containing a digital representation of the printed data along with the photograph of the bearer. =Printed data= The descriptions of the fields are printed in Swedish and English. *Card No. *Personal Id.

It has the following information: *The card's printed data in a digital format *The photograph in a JPEG format *A digital key to verify that the data is authentic and has not been tampered with The contents of the RFID chip cannot be accessed without using the codes found in the machine-readable area on the back of the card. Other identity cards in Sweden Nationals of any country who are legally resident in Sweden can get certified identification cards issued by the Tax Agency or their bank. Driving licences (if approved as a driver) are issued by the Transport Agency and usable as identification cards. However, none of these documents state the holder's citizenship and – whilst valid as travel documentation in the Nordic Union – are not recognised as official immigration documents by most other authorities in the EU. There is a political principle in Sweden that foreign citizens with residence permits shall be treated equally with citizens, and should not be identified more than necessary.

It is operated by the Northern Visions media and arts project, and although some staff are employed by the station, most involved are volunteers. NVTV is now the only local community station in Northern Ireland. History The station was launched on 9 February 2004, with the first programme aired being a film called The School Trip, which was made by students at the Fleming Fulton School in the city. Initially NVTV broadcast just one hour of programming on weekdays which was repeated on loop, with shows repeated again at the weekend; however, the station expanded its content and covers community and other events in and around the Belfast metropolitan area, as well as other commissioned programmes. Alongside several ongoing 'Community' programmes the mainstay of regular, weekly shows included 'the artery>'created and filmed by an independent Director, Royce Harper from the station's inception to late 2007. A 45-minute arts, culture and music magazine style show that won a sizeable production award in 2006 from The Northern Ireland Film & Television Commission (now NI Screen) Over 100 episodes were produced and aired on NVTV. The artery> was then further screened by Dublin Community Television, DCTV in ROI. The analogue signal was broadcast on UHF channel 62 (799.276 MHz) although coverage in Belfast was poor as it was out of group on many receiving aerials. NVTV was originally granted a four-year Restricted Service Licence by the Independent Television Commission, and is operated by the long established, non-profit Northern Visions media and arts centre in the Cathedral Quarter of the city. The station's facilities are used by 200 community-based organisations, as well as a range of individual actors and filmmakers. NVTV's analogue transmissions ceased in October 2012 during the digital switchover, however it continued to stream its programming online. On 10 October 2012, the channel was granted a 12-year local TV licence to broadcast on digital terrestrial television by Ofcom. The channel was relaunched on 29 September 2014 through the Freeview and Virgin Media platforms. It is currently licensed to transmit on UHF Channel 30 (Freeview LCN 7) the stations signal/coverage has Improved significantly since the digital switchover. Northern Visions Northern Visions was established in 1986 as a Channel 4 franchised workshop under the ACTT Workshop Agreement, with a strong emphasis on inclusion and the value of bringing communities together to meet a common goal. It was the first local \\"production company\\" in Northern Ireland to be awarded a Channel Four commission, one of a number of documentaries in the years that followed that went on to be broadcast by other European broadcasters, ZDF, RAI and ARTE and to win awards. Documentaries were also broadcast in Australia and America. The organisation was an integral part of the Film & Video Workshop Movement, which comprised groups with united passions for film, politics and a polemical critique of metropolitan, industrial hegemony and unbalanced forms of media representation. It worked as a collective providing facilities to other people for training or educational purposes, outside the realms of their creative production work. The ACTT Workshop Declaration was a ground-breaking agreement promulgated by the ACTT (now BECTU) in 1982, in consultation with the English Regional Arts Associations, the Welsh Arts Council, Channel Four and the BFI, recognising the alternative practices of the ‘workshops’ and constituting them to encourage a cultural, social and political contribution to society. The declaration was a radical step for a traditionally closed-shop union, and established working practices in the non-profit, cultural sector. Groups of four or more full-time members whose funding derived from public sources and who engaged in non-commercial work on a not-for-profit basis were enfranchised by the ACTT and given a condition to grant aid for a period of 1, 2 or 3 years, freeing them from ‘the tyranny of continually searching for insecure short time funding from arts organisations. Of immediate significance was that the ACTT placed the cultural and political ideologies of its new membership before wage concerns in allowing the groups to operate on an egalitarian minimum wage structure. The recognition of cross-grade practice also allowed filmworkers to gain experience in a range of roles and stipulated that the group and not the commissioner would own sole copyright to the work. In the late 1990s, the organisation decided to move away from programming for national broadcasters to develop local community distribution platforms and opportunities for communities at disadvantage in Northern Ireland. In 2002, they were one of fifteen groups selected by the Radio Authority to take part in the Access Radio pilot scheme, running during 2002/2003. The aim of the project was to inform the future regulator – Ofcom (Office of Communications) – whether Access Radio, a new tier of not-for-profit radio, was a viable concept and, if it was to be introduced in the future, how it might be licensed, regulated, funded, promoted and organised. In March 2003, a full evaluation of the project New Voices by Anthony Everitt, an independent evaluator, was published. In September 2003 Ofcom announced that it had decided to extend the period of the pilot scheme for, what it now refers to as, 'Community Radio', for a further year, until 31 December 2004. This pilot led to a new tier of community broadcasting in the UK when community radio stations were recognised as a distinct third tier of radio alongside BBC Radio and commercial radio in the Communications Act 2003. Following a loophole in legislation, Northern Visions joined with the Institute of Local Television, to lobby for local public service television on Freeview in the UK in 2003. They were joined by a number of advocates including the Community Media Association in Sheffield and Oxford local television (now \\"That's Oxford\\"), Somerset Film & Video and Channel 7 (now Estuary TV). In 2011, the Conservative Government published its Framework for Local TV. This created the opportunity for local TV licences to be awarded through a competitive selection process run by Ofcom to broadcast targeted and relevant local content including news, current affairs and entertainment programmes. Northern Visions moved into its present building in 2004 in Cathedral Quarter in Belfast and established an arts and digital media centre, principally to work with groups involved in the arts, culture and local heritage, media literacy and education, community development, urban regeneration and community relations. The vision is of a democratised form of media where new technologies are utilised as a tool for expression and creativity, to effect social change and combat poverty, social exclusion and isolation. The organisation has a strong community arts ethos. It has championed access and participation in the arts and has formulated new ways of making films and digital content with local communities throughout its history as an organisation. Its film Our Words Jump to Life, broadcast in 1988, was the first time an Irish film made through community arts practice was broadcast on national television. This was notable as the closed shop dominated the film and television industry at that time. The film went on to win several awards including the Celtic Film Festival, toured Australia and was picked up for broadcast by European television stations. The organisation has one of the largest repositories of community film archives in Ireland. Its collections are currently being digitised and made available online. As well as archives dating from the 1970s, the organisation has a special collection of archives of social life in Northern Ireland from the 1930s. Programming NVTV broadcasts from 6am to midnight, 7 days per week. Local news is broadcast at 7:15pm and 10:15pm in a half-hour programme, Focal Point, MondayFriday, with a Focal Point Round Up at the weekends. There are several regular shows, including Alan in Belfast (chat show), Collapse the Box (arts programming), Banterflix (movie reviews) and Discover the Archives (heritage and history shows). NVTV broadcasts Ulster-Scots and Irish language programming. NVTV also shares content with other local TV stations in Britain, including Latest TV in Brighton and shows from Brighton and Hove have been featured on NVTV also. It shares programming with Cork Community Television.

This shrub is native to the subtropical moist forests on the limestone hills in the northwestern corner of Puerto Rico. It was nearly eliminated due to several forces in its habitat. The land is privately owned and desirable for development with plans for construction of a resort and cell phone towers. The hills are quarried for limestone and deforestation is ongoing. The plant is already extremely rare, making it vulnerable to extinction from any one event. Vandalism could significantly reduce the population. This is an evergreen shrub with black-dotted green leaves up to 15 centimeters long by 6 wide. Two or three flowers occur in the leaf axils. The plant was discovered in 1976. It is so rare that the fruit of the species has not been formally described to science and seedlings have not been noted.

While officials from ICE have refused to comment on Arellano's death, advocates for immigrants, AIDS patients, and the LGBT community have decried the lack of provision of medical care as unjust and discriminatory. Victoria was born in Mexico and came to the United States as a child. She was a transgender woman who was categorized as male at birth. After contracting HIV, she was prescribed bactrim, later switching to dapasone. Both medications were daily antibiotics. Three years prior to being detained, doctors at a Los Angeles free clinic described her as \\"asymptomatic\\". Her condition began deteriorating in May 2007, when, after being detected entering the country illegally for the second time, she was detained at a facility in San Pedro, California, she was denied her medication and medical attention. Arellano was cared for by inmates at the facility, who took turns taking her to the bathroom and brought her cool towels. She was transported to the infirmary on July 13, 2007 and prescribed amoxicillin. She was unable to keep the drugs down and began vomiting blood. Eighty detainees protested the denial of her treatment, chanting \\"Hospital\\" and ignoring an order to get in line for the night's head count. She was transported to a hospital in San Pedro, but was returned to the facility within twenty-four hours. Again, she was debilitated by vomiting and diarrhea, and again transported to the hospital, this time to the intensive care unit of Little Company of Mary Hospital in San Pedro. She was handcuffed to her bunk and her door was guarded by two immigration agents. She died on July 20, 2007.

At least one member of his force, Chaplain John Barnard, urged a more vigorous offensive. Governor Daniel d'Auger de Subercase, with able assistance from Bernard-Anselme d'Abbadie de Saint-Castin, was the successful commander of the French and Indian troops.

It is endemic to Ecuador, where its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist montane forests. Description Axinaea sclerophylla is a small tree up to about high. The inflorescences are few in number with a small number of flowers in each inflorescence, the individual flowers being long. The flowers are purple, pink or nearly white and have fleshy, oblong petals and parts in fives. Distribution and habitat The species is endemic to Ecuador where it is found in the southern Andes at altitudes of between . It is known from just twelve populations in the montane forest zone, one from Sevilla de Oro in Azuay Province, one from near the Sígsig to Gualaquiza road in Morona-Santiago Province, and the rest from Loja and Zamora-Chinchipe Provinces. Ecology The flowers of A. sclerophylla are pollinated by birds. The stamens have inflated appendages attached to them on which birds feed. The bird is attracted to the stamens by the high sugar content and plucks and eats the whole anther. When a bird grasps one of the appendages with its beak, air is forced out through a small hole, carrying a puff of pollen which lands on the bird's face and neck. When it visits another flower, pollination is likely to occur. The disadvantage of this specialised pollination mechanism is that if a key bird species were to decline, the tree might be unable to find an alternative pollinator and soon become extinct. The masked flowerpiercer (Diglossa cyanea) has been observed feeding on the stamens, removing them one by one. Status Axinaea sclerophylla is an uncommon tree with a small range in the high Andes of southern Ecuador. It is known from just twelve populations; three of these populations are within the borders of the Podocarpus National Park. Apart from habitat destruction, no particular threats have been identified, but because of its rarity, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated the tree as \\"vulnerable\\".

Montoya won with a combination of Hispanic voters and coat-tails from the election of President Warren Harding. Republicans did not renominate him in 1922, choosing instead suffragist Adelina Otero-Warren, the niece of former territorial Governor, Miguel Otero, and the first woman to run for statewide office in New Mexico. Otero-Warren was defeated by Democrat John Morrow, an educator and lawyer from northeast New Mexico. Morrow would win consecutive re-elections in 1924 and 1926, but lost re-election in 1928 to Albert G. Simms, an Albuquerque businessman, on the coat-tails of the election of President Herbert Hoover.

Taxonomy The genus was circumscribed by Finnish mycologist Petter Karsten in 1889. Marinus Anton Donk redefined the limits of the genus in two publications in 1957 and 1962. Phanerochaete has traditionally been delimited based on the overall morphology of the fruit body, as well as microscopic characteristics including the nature of the hyphal structure, cystidia, and spores. Molecular analyses demonstrate that the genus is polyphyletic, containing members placed throughout the phlebioid clade of the Polyporales. The genus name is derived from the Greek words φανεφός (\\"distinct\\") and χαίτη (\\"hair\\"). Description Phanerochaete species have membranaceous, crust-like fruit bodies. The hyphal system is monomitic, with simple-septate generative hyphae; single or multiple clamps may be present in the subiculum. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped and smooth. Spores of the genus are thin-walled, inamyloid, hyaline, and have a cylindrical to ellipsoidal shape. Phanerochaete species cause white rot on both conifers and hardwoods. Chemistry Phanerochaete includes white rot fungi that are able to degrade the woody polymer lignin to carbon dioxide. This is achieved, in part, by lignin peroxidases and manganese peroxidases. These peroxidases are also able to mediate oxidation of a wide variety of organic pollutants. The genome of Phanerochaete chrysosporium was sequenced and shows the genetic potential to make over 100 cytochrome P450 monooxygenases. White rot fungi have been used in bioremediation efforts to break down potentially harmful chemicals in soil and in water. For example, phenol-formaldehyde is degraded by P. chrysosporium, while P. sordida breaks down the neonicotinoid pesticide clothianidin.

It was formed of basaltic lava flows in the Pleistocene with its youngest rocks dated at between 150,000 and 210,000 years ago.  The crater  Map showing the location of Rano Kau and the volcanoes Terevaka & Poike Rano Kau has a crater lake which is one of the island's only three natural bodies of fresh water. The lake is located approximately above sea level, but is more than below the highest of the crater's ridges. The volcanic cone is largely surrounded by water, and much of it has been eroded back to form high sea cliffs which at one point (te kari kari) have started to bite into the crater wall. The inside walls of the crater are sloped at an angle of between 65° (steepest, near the crest) and 45° (gentlest, at the lake shore). From the ruins of the ceremonial village of Orongo the cliff face drops to the southwest at an angle of 50° to the sea shore some below. On its northern side, the volcano slopes down to Mataveri International Airport. Rano Kau is in the world heritage site of Rapa Nui National Park and gives its name to one of the seven sections of the park. The principal archaeological site on Rano Kau is the ruined ceremonial village of Orongo which is located at the point where the sea cliff and inner crater wall converge. One ahu with several moai was recorded on the cliffs at Rano Kau in the 1880s, but had fallen to the beach by the time of the Routledge expedition in 1914. As well as basalt, it contains several other igneous rocks including obsidian (for which it was one of the major sources for the island's stoneworkers) and pumice. The crater is almost a mile across and has its own micro climate. Sheltered from the winds that wet most of the rest of the island, figs and vines flourish at Rano Kau.Flenley & Bahn 2003 The enigmas of Easter Island page 18 The inner slope was the site of the last toromiro tree in the wild until the specimen was chopped down for firewood in 1960.

One of the famous Marshall Plexis, it was introduced in 1965 and with its associated 4×12″ cabinets gave rise to the \\"Marshall stack\\". History The 1959 (Marshall's identifying numbers are not years of manufacture), produced from 1965 to 1981 (when it was replaced by the JCM800), is an amplifier in Marshall's \\"Standard\\" series. It was designed by Ken Bran and Dudley Craven after The Who's guitarist Pete Townshend asked Marshall for a 100 watt amplifier. Its output was first channeled into an 8×12″ cabinet, but that single, unwieldy cabinet was quickly changed to a pair of 4x12″ cabinets, 1960a \\"angled\\" on top and 1960b \\"box\\" on bottom, creating the famous \\"Marshall full stack\\". The amplifier also came as a PA and a bass version. The Plexiglas panel led to the name \\"Plexi\\", and while 50-watt models of the time are also called Plexis, the 1959 100 watt model is generally thought of as the \\"definitive\\" Plexi. The panels were actually made from much tougher polycarbonate plastic, but to the average American observer, it looked like the more familiar Plexiglas, and the name stuck. In 1969, Marshall replaced the Plexiglas panel with one of gold aluminum. There were other modifications: In 1966, the KT66 tubes of the JTM-models were replaced with EL34. After 1976, the plate voltages were lowered slightly for improved reliability. But during the 1970s, Marshall's increasing exports overseas led to a problem: Often the EL34 tubes would break during transportation, to the point where amps began being shipped from the factory with more rugged Tung-Sol 6550 tubes, which are \\"stiffer and not as harmonically rich\\" as the EL34 tubes. =Reissues= The amplifier was reissued for the first time in 1988 (the 1959S), and again from 1991 to 1993 (the 1959X) and from 1993 to 1995 (the 1959SLP). The SLP continued after 1995 but in 2000 Marshall added modifications to lower the noise floor (hum balance pot), reverted the negative feedback resistor to the 1968-69 value of 47 kΩ, and added an effects loop. The 1959SLP was sold until 2017. In 2005 Marshall introduced the 1959HW (for \\"hand-wired\\"), based on the 1967–1969 models, with negative feedback added corresponding to the 1969 model. This amplifier was called \\"expensive but good.\\" Guitar Player magazine called the 1959 \\"monumentally huge, frightfully loud, and painfully expensive\\", and its review of the 1959HW said it was \\"quick, percussive, articulate,\\" and required a \\"total commitment to volume.\\" Technical specifications The 1959 had 100 watts of power, two channels, and four inputs. They were equipped with four KT66 tubes, but models made after 1967 had four EL34 tubes instead; it had three ECC83 tubes in the pre-amplification stage. A model with tremolo, the 1959T, was available until 1973. The lead channel has a boosted bright tone, and the rhythm channel has a flatter response. Each channel has a high and a low gain input; the low gain input is attenuated by 6 dB. The channels can be linked with an instrument cable, a technique sometimes referred to as \\"jumping\\" and used to feed the same instrument through both channels simultaneously, for increased gain. Notable early users Besides Pete Townshend of The Who, early users include Eric Clapton, who in 1966, when he founded Cream, traded in his famous Bluesbreaker combo for a 1959 Plexi, and Jimi Hendrix, who used a 1959 with four 4×12″ cabinets (his \\"couple of great refrigerators\\") at the 1969 Woodstock Festival and established the Marshall as the \\"definitive rock amp\\". = Other notable users = * Dickey Betts * Duane Allman * John Frusciante * Angus Young * Malcolm Young * Eddie Van Halenhttp://ultimateclassicrock.com/eddie-van-halen- reveals-his-biggest-lie/ * Billie Joe Armstrong * Jason White * Jimi Hendrix * Wayne Kramer * Fred Smith * Graham Coxon * Jimmy Page * Johnny Ramone * Pete Townshend * Ace Frehley * Billy Gibbons * J Mascis * Matt Bellamy * Randy Rhoads * Steeve Thomas * Yngwie Malmsteen * George Lynch * Uli Jon Roth * Richie Kotzen * Slash * Richie Blackmore References Instrument amplifiers Marshall amplifiers Valve amplifiers ","title":"Marshall 1959"},{"id":"12860505","text":"The Plaxton Centro was a low entry single-decker bus bodywork designed by Bluebird Vehicles and manufactured by Plaxton.Centro Plaxton It was launched on the VDL SB120 chassis in February 2006 with the first built for Johnson,Brae.

ARMS tumors resemble the alveoli tissue that can be found in the lungs. Tumor location varies from patient to patient, but is commonly found in the head and neck region, male and female urogenital tracts, the torso, and extremities. Two fusion proteins can be associated with ARMS, but are not necessary, PAX3-FKHR (now known as FOXO1). and PAX7-FKHR. In children and adolescents ARMS accounts for about 1 percent of all malignancies, has an incidence rate of 1 per million, and most cases occur sporadically with no genetic predisposition. PAX3-FOXO1 is now known to drive cancer-promoting gene expression programs through creation of distant genetic elements called super enhancers.  Genetics  There is no genetic predisposition for developing ARMS, but there are a few genetic recombination events that occurs to cause the fusion protein to be synthesized. In order to have the PAX3-FOXO1 fusion there needs to be a recombination event that translocates part of chromosome 13 to chromosome 2, and for PAX7-FOXO1 fusion there must be a translocation of part of chromosome 13 to chromosome 1. The 2;13 translocation reciprocal is often balanced and not amplified, while the 1;13 translocation reciprocal is sometimes viewed as balanced and sometimes not, so it is often amplified. The PAX7-FOXO1 fusion is often amplified in tumors (about 70 percent of all PAX7-FOXO1 fusion positive tumors) and the PAX3-FOXO1 fusion is rarely amplified (only in 5 percent of all PAX3-FOXO1 fusion positive tumors). About 60 percent of all ARMS cases are positive for PAX3-FOXO1 fusion gene, 20 percent are positive for PAX7-FOXO1 fusion gene, and the remaining 20 percent are fusion negative ARMS cases. Both fusion genes are composed of either the PAX3 or PAX7 DNA binding domains and the FOXO1 transactivation domain. This fusion causes a dysregulation of transcription and acts as an oncogene promoting cancer formation.  Pathology  ARMS cells are often small with little cytoplasm. The nuclei of the cells are round with normal, dull, chromatin structures. The ARMS cells often clump together and have fibrovascular septae that interrupts the aggregates. The fibrovascular septae that disrupts the aggregates often give the tumor the physiology of the alveoli found in the lungs. In a few cases, there may not be any fibrovascular septae and this gives the tumor a more solid phenotype and no alveoli physiology. Immunostaining for myogenin and for MyoD can be used to determine ARMS from other rhabdomyosarcoma tumors and immunostaining for AP2β and p-cadherin can distinguish fusion positive ARMS from fusion negative. = Embryonic origin and epidemiology = ARMS usually occurs in the skeletal muscles and is postulated to be derived from precursor cells within the muscle tissue. During embryonic development ARMS occurs in the mesoderm which is the precursor for the skeletal muscle tissue. ARMS accounts for roughly 20 to 30 percent of all rhabdomyosarcoma tumors and therefore accounts for roughly 1 percent of malignancies found in children and adolescents. There is an age determination on which PAX proteins fuse together with the FOXO1 transcription factor. PAX3-FOXO1 positive subset of ARMS occurs mostly in older children and young adults, while PAX7-FOXO1 positive subset of ARMS and fusion negative subsets occur most often in younger children. = Clinical = ARMS usually occurs in the skeletal muscle tissue of the extremities, but it is still very common in the torso, head, and neck regions. The primary tumor often presents itself as a soft mass of tissue that is painless, but the tumor can be detected if it starts to put pressure on other structures in the primary site. A large fraction of patients who are diagnosed with ARMS, roughly 25-30 percent, will have metastases at the time of diagnosis. The standard sites for metastases to form are the bone marrow, the bones, and distal nodes. Typical treatment options for patients who have been diagnosed with ARMS include standard surgery, radiation therapy, and intensive chemotherapy.  Prognosis  Patients who have been diagnosed with ARMS often have poor outcomes. The four year survival rate without remission for local ARMS tumors is 65 percent, while the four year survival rate with metastatic ARMS is only 15 percent. Patients who have metastatic ARMS positive with PAX3-FOXO1 fusion often have a poorer outcome than patients positive with PAX7-FOXO1 fusion, with a four-year survival rate of 8 percent and 75 percent respectively. Other variables affect the four year survival rate, such as primary tumor site, size of primary tumor, amount of local invasion, number of distal lymph nodes spread to, and whether metastasis has occurred. Prognosis for patients who have primary tumor sites within the bones often have higher survival rates and respond well to treatment options. While patients who have primary tumor sites within the nasopharynx region with metastases to the breast have very poor outcomes. Patients who are fusion protein negative with low risk clinical features should be treated with reduced therapy, while patients who are fusion protein positive with low risk clinical features should be treated as an intermediate risk and have more intensive therapy regimens.

The pass reaches an elevation of 1610 meters along the national highway N621 which connects the city of León with Cantabria and which passes through Asturias. The pass is situated some 800m from the southern border of the Picos de Europa National Park, a park included in UNESCO's World Network of Biosphere Reserves and shared by the provinces of León, Asturias and Cantabria. The valleys of this part of the Cantabrian Mountains include sites in the European Union's Natura 2000 network and Special Protection Areas for the conservation of wild birds. San Glorio is used as a corridor by the Cantabrian brown bear Ursus arctos, catalogued in Spain as being in danger of extinction.Spain's Ministry of the Environment Threatened Species List http://www.mma.es/secciones/biodiversidad/especies_amenazadas/catalogo_especies/vertebrados_mamiferos/pdf/ver18.pdf Moreover, the slopes of the glacial valleys making up the surrounding region are home to an important variety of plant life.  Environmental issues  San Glorio is also the name of a projected ski resort in the area. Involving some 60 kilometres of pistes, the development was first suggested in the 1970s. The current project was presented in 2003 and has so far not gone ahead due to legal challenges related to the environmental value of the area. The scientific community warned of irreparable damage that would result to the habitat from the construction of large facilities. Much of the land in question belongs to the Natural Park of Fuentes Carrionas y Fuente Cobre- Montaña Palentina. thumbright The Valle del Naranco, one of the valleys that may become car parking and access to the San Glorio winter sports development if the project goes ahead According to a 2006 report published by the Ministry of the Environment,Picos de Europa National Park and Mount Covadonga (A. Álvarez, et al.) Spain's Ministry for the Environment Report (in Spanish) the Picos de Europa has \\"conservation problems at local level\\" due mainly to the role tourism plays, but also because there are > \\"...no planning regulations for this unequalled territory. The regional > government of Castilla and León has commenced construction of a ski resort > (Esla 2000), near the San Glorio mountain pass.

Leading Spanish experts have warned that despite an evident rise, the bear population will not be viable until there are \\"several hundred\\". Asturias only has a 25% forest coverage, the lowest for any existing bear region in Europe (other bear areas have more than 50% forest coverage) and habitat improvement is therefore a key issue. Another problem is that of infrastructures. According to Jon Swenson, vice-president for Eurasia of the International Bear Association (IBA), the effect of a ski station would cause the same environmental impact as a town of 3,000 inhabitants and bears would keep at least 10 km away from such facilities. Brown bears in Spain Likewise, in a paper presented in February 1989 at the Eighth International Conference on Bear Research and Management, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, Christopher Servheen of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service stated that the continued reduction in habitat further isolates the two subpopulations in the Cantabrian Mountains, \\"making them more susceptible to the demographic and genetic consequences of small population size.\\"Status & Conservation of Bears of the World  Legal issues  Although Spain's Ministry for the Environment has opposed the development of San Glorio, the regional government of Castile and León has adopted major changes in regional planning which may permit future development, including the removal of a prohibition from March 2006 on the construction of ski resorts in the protected area of Fuentes Carrionas. At the beginning of 2008, Spain's Defensor del Pueblo, with a direct mandate to initiate proceedings at Spain's Constitutional Court, submitted the following to Castilla and León's department of the environment: > \\"Que esa Consejería realice las gestiones pertinentes para que se proceda a > derogar el Decreto 13/2006, al ser contrario a la legalidad vigente en > materia de Espacios Naturales y Evaluación Ambiental, por no haber sido > evaluada previamente la modificación del PORN de Fuentes Carrionas y Fuente > Cobre-Montaña Palentina, que contiene tal Decreto\\". (That the department [of the environment] take the necessary steps to repeal Law 13/2006, as it contravenes legislation in force regarding Natural Spaces and Environmental Assessment through there not having been a prior evaluation of the modification to the development plan of the Natural Park of Fuentes Carrionas y Fuente Cobre-Montaña Palentina which is contained in the Law in question.) In March 2008, the High Court of Castilla y León ruled that the regional government's sudden change in its own planning regulations, solely with the intention of permitting a ski resort, not only went against its own regional law, but both the national law on nature conservation and the European Natura 2000 regulations. The Court accepted the results of research submitted by the University of Salamanca and Spain's Higher Council for Scientific Research (CSIC), both of which strongly criticised plans to develop within protected land.La justicia veta una estación de esquí al ser inviable con el cambio de clima · ELPAÍS.com The regional government attempted to respond to the legal challenge with a plagiarised report which had to be withdrawn. At the end of 2009 it produced another report which proposed that Fuentes Carrionas and Picos de Europa should be considered together as an area where ski resorts are possible.  Initiatives  The consortium backing the San Glorio resort claims that its proposal is the only means of preventing the villages of the region from becoming depopulated. Similarly, the local population of the villages affected has come out in favour of the project, basing their arguments on what is claimed will be a boost to the local economy. However, the economic benefits are disputed by the NGOs leading the campaign against the project, who, in turn, accuse the promoters of the development of having merely speculative aims. Both sides, on the one hand, the promoter and on the other hand, the association of NGOs opposing the development, have been collecting signatures in support of their respective initiatives. As of August 2007, the association of NGOs defending the protection of the nature park claimed to have collected 11,780 signatures, while the consortium of developers claimed to have collected 3,000 signatures. A conference held August 2007, organised by SEO/Birdlife (Birdlife International's Spanish section) together with WWF/Adena (the World Wildlife Fund's Spanish office), and two Spanish bear conservation organisations (Fapas and Fundación Oso Pardo), reaffirmed these organisations' opposition to the project. The issue has been raised before the European Parliament, with Euro- MP David Hammerstein requesting the European Commission to look into the funding of the project, claiming that the regional government receives EU funding because of the park's required protection as a most seriously threatened habitat, while at the same time applying for subsidies for the jobs at the projected ski resort and hotel complex.

She reached Pearl Harbor 28 February; and, following a month's training, she sailed for the Central Pacific in convoy 21 March. She arrived Majuro, Marshalls, ten days later and began extensive cargo shuttle operations which, for the next nine months, sent her throughout the Central Pacific. After completing runs to Kwajalein and Roi, she transported men and supplies to Tarawa, Gilberts, early in May. She returned damaged material to Pearl Harbor later that month; thence, she resumed supply operations out of the Marshalls. = Delivering cargo at Saipan = On 23 July Pavo departed Eniwetok in convoy for the Marianas. Arriving Saipan the 28th, she discharged tons of cargo both there and at the recently captured island of Tinian. She returned to Eniwetok in mid-August, but by 1 September she had resumed offloading cargo at Saipan.

X550  In 2012, GE Power Pro X550 was introduced with Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) $149.99 as a minor improvement on the GE Power Pro X500 with added advanced object tracking capabilities to automatically focus on moving objects.  X600  GE Power Pro X600 with MSRP $199.99 when announced in 2012 has a 14.4 MP CMOS sensor, 26x optical zoom (26–676 mm), capable of capturing Full HD 1080p video recording. According to PC Magazine, the camera is suitable for who have a little cash, but has sharp lens, affordable zoom, an EVF and uses Lithium battery. The photo and video quality is not the best, but can give a good photo in low ISO and in 800 ISO has noise lower than 1.5 percent and use Imatest give 1,842 lines per picture height or more than 1,800 lines as a sharp quality photo. The camera has many physical controls, but has no Aperture priority mode (has PSM mode). Relatively slow when start and need 0.1-0.15 seconds of shutter response, but can take 7fps continuous shooting for 150 images without slowdown using SD card with transfer rate at least 95 MB/second. The body shape of the camera is similar with Panasonic Lumix FZ200 with deep handgrip, big lens, and eye-level EVF, but more compact with only 12.5 ounces (350 grams) weight. The camera can also take Pancapture panorama photo, 6 multi successive exposures in one frame and has 6x digital zoom, but no RAW, no stereo sound and no hotshoe. The shutter speeds longest is also only 4 seconds.  X2600  GE Power Pro X2600 with MSRP 169.99 has optical zoom 26x as GE Power Pro X600, but use 16MP CCD sensor, bigger and heavier without EVF. Imatest give 2,308 lines per picture height or better than GE Power Pro X600, but all other performances are worse than the sibling. PC Magazine suggests to choose the GE Power Pro X600 due to only a slightly higher price.

A GABA receptor agonist is a drug that is an agonist for one or more of the GABA receptors, producing typically sedative effects, and may also cause other effects such as anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant effects. There are three receptors of the gamma-aminobutyric acid. The two receptors GABA-α and GABA-ρ are ion channels that are permeable to chloride ions which reduces neuronal excitability. The GABA-β receptor belongs to the class of G-Protein coupled receptors that inhibit adenylyl cyclase, therefore leading to decreased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). GABA-α and GABA-ρ receptors produce sedative and hypnotic effects and have anti-convulsion properties. GABA-β receptors also produce sedative effects. Furthermore, they lead to changes in gene transcription.

These drugs act instead as positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) and while they do bind to the GABA receptors, they bind to an allosteric site on the receptor and cannot induce a response from the neuron without an actual agonist being present. Drugs that fall into this class exert their pharmacodynamic action by increasing the effects that an agonist has when potentiation is achieved. Most general anaesthetics are PAMs of GABA-A receptor. Positive allosteric modulators work by increasing the frequency with which the chloride channel opens when an agonist binds to its own site on the GABA receptor. The resulting increase in the concentration of Cl− ions in the postsynaptic neuron immediately hyperpolarizes this neuron, making it less excitable and thus inhibiting the possibility of an action potential. However, some general anesthetics like propofol and high doses of barbiturates may not only be positive allosteric modulators of GABA-A receptors but also direct agonists of these receptors. Alcohol is an indirect GABA agonist. GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, and GABA-like drugs are used to suppress spasms. Alcohol is believed to mimic GABA's effect in the brain, binding to GABA receptors and inhibiting neuronal signaling.

Teleflex has annual revenues of $2.4 billion, operations in 40 countries, and more than 12,000 employees.Corporate-IR.net By 2011, the company had substantially realigned to focus on its current business as a medical-device manufacturer, having undergone several years of active acquisitions and divestitures. Teleflex has been associated with Irish corporate tax avoidance tools. Teleflex's current chief executive officer (CEO) is Liam J. Kelly, who took over from Benson F. Smith at the start of 2018; Kelly is also the company's president and former chief operating officer. History Teleflex was founded in 1943. Over time the business expanded into a conglomerate operating in multiple markets, often through acquisitions, such as: * Franklin Medical Ltd (1985) * Warne Surgical Products Ltd (1985) * Willy Rüsch AG (1989) * Pilling (1991) * Access Surgical (1993) * Nextex (1993) * Unimed (1994) * General Medical OEM Division (1994) * Europe Medical (1994) * Fehling (1994) * Simal (1994) * Endoscopy Specialists, Inc. (1995) * Asid Bonz (1996) * Comcorp Technologies, Inc. (1997) In general these acquisitions moved the business further into the design, build and supply of medical devices, a move that had begun in 1981 with the construction of the Applied Polymer plant in New Hampshire. Several acquisitions were not in line with this strategy. Comcorp, for example, was a supplier of pedals and other components for passenger cars and light-duty trucks and Nextex a fiber-optic communications business. Refocus on the medical device sector began in March 2009 when Teleflex sold its marine and industrial instrumentation (gauge) business to Veethree, and planned to exit its Lakewood Ranch, Florida facility. Veethree subsequently continued production of former Teleflex products at its Manatee County, Florida facility and hired approximately 50 workers from Teleflex. In March 2011, Teleflex sold its marine division, Teleflex Marine, to H.I.G. Capital. In August 2012, Teleflex substantively finalized an agreement to acquire all assets of the medical device maker LMA International, thereby expanding the company's anesthesia device franchise. In December 2013, Teleflex completed the acquisition of Vidacare Corporation, integrating Vidacare's intraosseous EZ-IO and OnControl medical devices into Teleflex's Arrow product line. On September 5, 2017, Teleflex announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire NeoTract in a transaction valued at up to $1.1B USD. Under the terms of the agreement, Teleflex will acquire NeoTract for an up-front cash payment of $725M USD and up to an additional $375M USD contingent on the achievement of certain sales- related commercial milestones through December 31, 2020. The transaction was unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors for both Teleflex and NeoTract. On January 18, 2019, the S&P; Dow Jones Indices added Teleflex to its famous stock market index, the S&P; 500. The company replaced PG&E;, a gas and power company, after the utility company announced it would declare bankruptcy on January 14, 2019. Patent case It was a party in the KSR v. Teleflex patent case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States concerning the issue of obviousness as applied to patent claims. Irish tax schemes In September 2018, the Irish Times revealed that Teleflex had created a new single malt Irish corporate tax avoidance scheme in July 2018. The article noted that Teleflex had previously used a double Irish Irish corporate tax avoidance scheme, and that such tax schemes had contributed to the Teleflex aggregate corporate tax rate falling to circa 3%.

The Pollen Analysis Circular was a mimeographed publication that maintained communications among scientists working on either side of the Atlantic Ocean during World War II and aided the early development of the field of palynology. It was initiated by Paul Sears in 1943 and published somewhat regularly until May 1949 (No. 17), by which time scientific meetings had again become feasible. Publication was made possible by contributions and the efforts of many individuals at various institutions. It provided comments and discussion on the field, progress reports on research projects, lists and addresses of researchers in the field, bibliographies, obituaries, and other news items. A final issue, No. 18, was printed in January 1954. History The international scientific cooperation on which the field of palynology depended was interrupted by the onset of World War II. The Pollen Analysis Circular was a response to increased handicaps to travel during the late stages of World War II. Because palynology was a well established trans-Atlantic field by the time World War II broke out, workers in the United States, Britain, and Germany in particular, had difficulty maintaining contact with one another. The Pollen Analysis Circular allowed researchers in the United States to maintain contact with one another and maintain publication lists that had, until then, been published by Gunnar Erdtman as \\"Literature on Pollen Statistics and Related Topics\\". The first issue of the Pollen Analysis Circular was dated May 5, 1943 and published by Paul B. Sears (Oberlin College). Subsequent issues were generally edited by Sears, sometimes in cooperation with L.R. Wilson. In January 1945, the Pollen Analysis Circular was renamed the Pollen and Spore Circular to more accurately reflect its scope. After 1954, the Circular was incorporated into the Micropaleontologist, soon renamed Micropaleontology, published by the American Museum of Natural History. The last issue of the Pollen and Spore Circular (#18) was edited by Calvin J. Heusser and announced the fusion, indicating that \\"the spore and pollen section will constitute four to six pages in each issue and contain essentially the same material\\" as in the Pollen and Spore Circular. The final issue also included abstracts from the First Palynology Conference (February 25, 1953), held at Yale University as well as correspondence from researchers working as far afield as Düsseldorf, Lucknow, and Indianapolis.  Highlights  It was in the pages of the Pollen Analysis Circular that the field of pollen analysis was given the modern name of palynology based on correspondence in issues 6, 7, and 8 between H.A. Hyde and D.A. Williams, who are credited with coming up with the name palynology, along with contributions by Ernst Antevs, Paul B. Sears, A. Orville Dahl, and L. R. Wilson.

Biography  Mabel Hubbard Gardiner Bell as a girl, ca. 1860 Mabel Gardiner Hubbard with her husband Alexander Graham Bell and their daughters Elsie (left) and Marian (1885). The Brodhead-Bell-Morton Mansion, the Bells' home from 1882–1889, in Washington, D.C., as it appeared in 2008. Mabel Gardiner Hubbard was born on November 25, 1857 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States, to Gardiner Greene Hubbard and Gertrude Mercer McCurdy. She suffered a near-fatal bout of scarlet fever close to her fifth birthday in 1862 while visiting her maternal grandparents in New York City, and was thereafter left permanently and completely deaf. The disease also destroyed her inner ear's vestibular sensors, additionally leaving her with a greatly impaired sense of balance, to the extent that it was very difficult for her to walk at night in the dark. Mabel was the inspiration for her father's involvement in the founding of the first oral school for the deaf in the United States, the Clarke School for the Deaf. Having been educated in both the United States and in Europe, she learned to both talk and lip-read with great skill in multiple languages.Eber, 1991. pp. 43–45Gray, 2006 She was also, due in great part to her parents' efforts, one of the first deaf children in the nation to be taught to both lip-read and speak, which allowed her to integrate herself easily and almost completely within the hearing world,Eber, 1991; p .45 an event virtually unknown to those in the deaf community of that era. In support of her parents' efforts to increase funding for deaf education, Mabel testified before a congressional hearing at a young age. Her avoidance of the deaf community until her middle age when her parents died and left her to assume their roles as benefactor to the societies for the deaf, would later lead to criticisms that she was embarrassed by her impairment. Described as \\"strong and self-assured\\", she became one of Graham Bell's pupils at his new school for the deaf, and later evolved into his confidant. They married on July 11, 1877 in the Cambridge home of her parents, when she was 19, more than 10 years Bell's junior. Together they had four children, including two daughters: Elsie May Bell (1878–1964) who married Gilbert Hovey Grosvenor of National Geographic fame, and Marian Hubbard Bell (1880–1962), who was referred to as \\"Daisy\\", and who was nearly named Photophone by Bell after her birth. Mabel also bore two sons, Edward (1881) and Robert (1883), both of whom died shortly after birth leaving their parents bereft.Gray, 2006. From 1877, Mabel and \\"Alec\\", as she preferred to call him, lived in Washington, D.C. at their home, the Brodhead-Bell Mansion, which they occupied for several years, and from 1888 onwards residing increasingly at their Beinn Bhreagh (Gaelic for \\"beautiful mountain\\") estate, in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, Canada. After Alec's death in 1922, Mabel slowly lost her sight and grew increasingly consigned to the care of her daughters, withdrawing into a world of silent darkness. She died of pancreatic cancer at the home of her daughter Marian, in Chevy Chase, Maryland, less than a year after her husband, both of whom are buried near their home on \\"The Point\\" at their estate of Beinn Bhreagh, originally their summer residence. Her ashes were interred with Alexander's grave exactly one year, to the hour, after his burial. Today, they rest together near the top of their \\"beautiful mountain\\" of their estate overlooking Bras d'Or Lake, under a simple boulder of granite.  Deaf to Bell's utterances  The Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia, 1876, propelled the Bells to international fame. Mabel was the indirect source of her husband's early commercial success after his creation of the telephone. The U.S. Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876 made Bell's newly invented telephone a featured headline worldwide. Judges Emperor Dom Pedro II of the Empire of Brazil and the eminent British physicist William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) recommended his device to the Committee of Electrical Awards, which voted Bell the Gold Medal for Electrical Equipment. Bell also won a second Gold Medal for Visible Speech, for his additional display at the exposition, helping to propel him to international fame. Bell, who was then a full-time teacher, hadn't even planned on exhibiting at the fair due to his heavy teaching schedule and preparation for his student's examinations. He went there only at the stern insistence of Mabel, his fiancée and future wife.Waite 1961. pp. 158–169. Mabel had understood Bell's reluctance to go to the exhibition and display his works. She secretly bought his train ticket to Philadelphia, packed his bag, and then took the unknowing Bell to Boston's train station where she told her shocked fiancé that he was going on a trip. When Bell started to argue, Mabel turned her sight away from him, thus becoming literally deaf to his protests.De Land, Fred. Notes on the Development of the Telephone, Popular Science, November 1906, pp.427–438;  Mabel's stock ownership in the Bell Telephone Company  The Bell Telephone Company was organized on July 9, 1877 by Mabel's father Gardiner Greene Hubbard who owned 1,387 of the 5,000 issued shares and had the title of \\"trustee\\". Mabel's husband Alexander Bell owned 1,497 shares. But Bell immediately transferred all but 10 of his shares as a wedding gift to his new bride Mabel. A short time later, just prior to leaving for an extended honeymoon of Europe, Mabel signed a power of attorney giving control of her shares to her father. This made Gardiner Hubbard the de facto president and chairman of the Bell Telephone Company,Pizer, Russell A. The Tangled Web of Patent #174465, Authorhouse, 2009, , , page.127. which later evolved into American Telephone & Telegraph, at times the world's largest telephone company.  Support to aeronautical research  Mabel was highly intelligent but usually preferred to remain in the background while Bell conducted scientific discussions and meetings among his peers—for many decades he held regular Wednesday evening intellectual salons in their home parlour, dutifully documented in the multiple volumes of his \\"homenotes\\". However Mabel strongly believed that a heavier-than-air vehicle could be designed to fly, and she provided the inspiration and financing of about $20,000CAD to that end, a significant amount in 1907 (approximately $450,000 in 2008 dollars).Rannie Gillis. Mabel Bell Was A Focal Figure In The First Flight of the Silver Dart, Cape Breton Post, September 29, 2008. Retrieved from First Airplane Flight In Canada website, April 2, 2010. At that time Mabel Bell sold some of her real estate and gave that amount of money to her husband and four others to establish the Aerial Experimental Association (AEA),Toward, 1984. pp.141–155 for the purpose of constructing \\"a practical flying aerodrome\\", Canada's first heavier-than-air vehicle, the Silver Dart. Based on their scientific experiments, the aircraft they designed and built incorporated several technical innovations not previously invented for flight, including lateral control by means of ailerons.Kermode, A.C.

T. Amaryllis lesion nematode, Pratylenchus hippeastri. EENY-546. University of Florida IFAS. 2012. They are parasitic on plants and are responsible for root lesion disease on many taxa of host plants in temperate regions around the world. Lesion nematodes are migratory endoparasites that feed and reproduce in the root and move around, unlike the cyst or root-knot nematodes, which may stay in one place. They usually only feed on the cortex of the root.Lesion nematodes. University of Illinois Extension. 1999. Species are distinguished primarily by the morphology of the stylets.Norton, D. C. Ecology of Plant-Parasitic Nematodes. 1978. Hosts and symptoms Root lesion nematodes infect a great variety of hosts. Pratylenchus penetrans alone has over 350 host plants. They include agricultural crops such as soybeans, potatoes, corn, bananas, and wheat. The genus is found most often in corn.Perry, R. N. and M. Moens (eds.) Plant Nematology. CABI. 2006. Signs of disease are similar in most plants and generally include necrotic lesions of the roots. The lesions can also be entrances for pathogenic bacteria and fungi, which produce secondary infections. Above ground the plant becomes stunted, chlorotic, and wilted, and it often dies. A crop field may be patchy as plants wither and die. Root lesion nematodes can cause significant yield losses.Barker, K. R., et al. Plant Nematode Interactions. Madison: American Society of Agronomy, Inc. 1998. Environment Pratylenchus abundance is affected by soil moisture, mineral components, temperature, aeration, organic matter, and pH. They are more common in sandy soils and land with weed infestations.Hallmann, J., et al. (2007). Occurrence and importance of plant- parasitic nematodes in organic farming in Germany. Nematology 9(6), 869-79. Pratylenchus can endure a wide range of environmental conditions. Moist temperate soils are ideal conditions for breeding and migrating underground, but they can persist in warm and dryer environments. In very dry conditions they are quiescent until moisture increases and plants resume growth.Agrios, G. N. Plant Pathology 5th ed. p. 852. Most lesion nematodes remain inactive when soil temperatures are below 59 °F (15 °C) and are not fully active until temperatures rise above 68 °F (20 °C). Management One common management option for crop-pest lesion nematodes is soil fumigation and nematicides. This is not effective for all species, and can be expensive for growers.Dropkin, V. H. Introduction to Plant Nematology, 2nd ed. New York: John Wiley & Sons. 1989. Water immersion is another option. Infected plants are immersed in a hot water bath for about 30 minutes, which rids them of nematodes but does not harm the plant. This method has been successful for P. coffeae. Crop rotation can help control the nematode load in the soil because different plants are susceptible to different Pratylenchus species.Saxena, G. and K. G. Mukerji. Management of Nematode and Insect-Borne Plant Diseases. New York: The Haworth Press. 2007. Selecting resistant plant varieties and cultivars can reduce nematode problems. This is currently the only option for control of P. vulnus, for example. Life cycle and pathology Female nematodes lay single eggs in the root or in the soil. They reproduce via parthenogenesis, laying fertile eggs without fertilization. In many species, males are rare.

Set in modern-day Britain, it continues from The Age of Misrule and The Dark Age. The first book in the trilogy, Jack of Ravens, was released on 20 July 2006. The second, The Burning Man, was released on 17 April 2008. The third book, Destroyer of Worlds, was released in August 2009. Background The first trilogy in the series, The Age of Misrule, told of the catastrophic return to Britain of the Old Gods of legend, and the battle of a group of five known as the Brothers and Sisters of Dragons to protect humanity. The Dark Age explored the lives of a new group of Brothers and Sisters, struggling to cope in the new world left behind in the wake of the first trilogy. Kingdom of the Serpent picks up the story where the cliffhanger ending of The Dark Age left off. The world, returning to the old ways due to the influence of the returning Gods, was dealt a dreadful blow by an entity known as the Void, recreating the menial, soul-destroying world it had become before the Gods' return, and trapping the Brothers and Sisters of Dragons - the only ones who could fight it - in menial lives, their heritage forgotten and their power lying dormant. The only one who can save them is Jack Churchill who, following the final battle with the dark god Balor has found himself lost in Bronze-age Britain This series begins with Jack waking up in The Second Battle of Mag Tuired, wandering about in a mist, he is beginning to forget who he is, and comes across a giant fighting with some Celtic warriors and ends up slaying it with his sword, earning the name 'Jack Giant Killer'. The warriors convince the a village to take Jack in, who is miserable as he is losing his memories of Ruth and his life before, it is revealed that this is due to the spider embedded in his shoulder, which is eventually removed as it is apparently killing him slowly, whilst saving him four Iron Age Celts and Church end up becoming the first brothers and sisters of dragons. Church is tricked by Niamh, who is selfish and arrogant, into becoming her slave by giving him food and drink which was not given without obligation and she takes him into the otherworld. Whilst traveling to Niamh's court he meets fellow prisoner, 'the Mocker' or Jerzy, who was stolen to entertain and Niamh ended up sending him to the court of the final word for some adjustments leaving his face disfigured in a large rictus grin. Church realises that because of the way time moves in the otherworld he may yet see Ruth again someday, and begins hopping periodically through time, via the otherworld. Meanwhile, the void has taken Ryan Veitch into its service as he has become bitter and twisted about how he was killed for something out of his control (being used by a caraprix) and systematically goes through time killing as many brothers and sisters of dragons as he can, whilst working with a sinister, flamboyant character none as the 'Libertarian'. Who is described as having 'red lidless eyes'. Erego Veitch kills the first brother and sisters of dragons whilst Church is stuck in the otherworld with Niamh, and writes 'scum' on the wall in blood hinting that Veitch is the killer. Also the first brothers and sisters of dragons are taken into the service of the void as the brothers and sisters of spiders. Church encounters Tom as well, while in the other world and Niamh begins to change into the character we see in the Age of Misrule. Church eventually figures out someones killing off all brothers and sisters of dragons and begins to bring them back to the other world in preparation for a final battle. As the church was doing this, the void was manipulating humans and bringing Gods to its cause like that of 'Janus god of doorways' and 'Loki' the Norse trickster god. When Jack appears in Rome Veitch captures him and takes him to Janus who traps him in a series of what are described to be like vines which leaches Jack's pendragon spirit. Church is rescued and later into the night the lantern containing his pendragon spirit (which he has to get back inside him if he wishes to defeat the void) is stolen. All the while The court of the final word was searching the heart of existence in the hope that not only will they survive the void but the evolution of humans as well. When Niamh gives Church a chance of freedom he instead gifts it to Jerzy who races to a roof and tries to jump off and reveals he stole the lamp for the court of the final word and has a carapix within his head. When they travel to stonehenge in 1851, Jerzy disappears, kidnapped by the Puck, one of the oldest things in the land. Veitch and the Libertarian begin to search for the extinction shears which can wipe something totally from existence as if it never existed. In 1969 the libertarian offers Church a deal to be placed in a 'sleep like death' and locked in a casket in the otherworld forever, and in doing so Laura, Shavi and Ruth would not be killed in the present. Trapped inside his head Church meets the Caretaker and the Daughters Of The Night, and is guided to the Axis of Existence and if offered to use it to do anything he wants. He brings back Niamh and Thomas the Rhymer, but the price was that Niamh was to be evil and worked for the void. Church was unaware of this. Realising who they were, Laura, Shavi, and Ruth find clues everywhere leading them to travel to the otherworld in search of Church. With a kiss Ruth wakes Church. Major characters Jack Churchill: Leader of the Brothers and Sisters of Dragons in The Age of Misrule, the man known as 'Church' has been missing since that trilogy's conclusion. Ruth Gallagher: Formerly a powerful witch with the patronage of the Triple Goddess, a powerful member of the Tuatha Dé Danann, Ruth has been trapped in a thankless life working in a care home.

Shavi: A bisexual Shaman, Shavi is also trapped in the new world.

He helped his team win the Southwest Conference Co-Championship with a 9-2 record, which included the clinching touchdown run against Texas A&M; University. He was the Most Valuable Player in the 1960 Gator Bowl after scoring the winning touchdown, with a 19-yard run against Georgia Tech University, still considered to be a storied play in school history. Mooty finished his college career after rushing for 1,152 yards on 211 carries for an average of 5.4 yards, 9 touchdowns and 13 receptions for 156 yards. He returned kickoffs, highlighted by a 100-yard return against Hardin–Simmons University in 1958. He also practiced college baseball. He was inducted into the University of Arkansas Sports Hall of Honor. In 1981, he was inducted into the Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame. In 2011, he was inducted into the Union County Sports Hall of Fame. He was also named to the University of Arkansas All-Century Team and All-Decade Team of the 1950s. Professional career Mooty was signed by the Dallas Cowboys after going undrafted in the 1960 NFL Draft, because he was considered small to play running back in the National Football League. He was a part of the franchise's inaugural season and was a backup safety in 7 games, after suffering a torn quadriceps in his left leg during training camp. On June 9, 1961, he announced his retirement. Personal life Mooty is involved in the Hospital Clinics business.

Design Grease fittings are permanently installed by either a (taper) thread or straight push-fit ('hammer in') arrangement, leaving a nipple connection that a grease gun attaches to. The pressure supplied by the grease gun forces a small captive bearing ball in the fitting to move back against the force of its retaining spring. The arrangement is thus essentially a valve that opens under pressure to allow lubricant to pass through a channel and be forced into the voids of the bearing. When the pressure ceases, the ball returns to its closed position. The ball excludes dirt and functions as a check valve to prevent grease escaping back out of the fitting. The ball is almost flush with the surface of the fitting so that it can be wiped clean to reduce the amount of debris carried with the grease into the bearing. The common convex shape of the fitting allows the concave tip of the grease gun to seal against the fitting easily from many angles, yet with a sufficiently tight seal to force the pressured grease to move the ball and enter the fitting, rather than simply oozing past this temporary annular (ring-shaped) seal. A less common design has a few names including 'button head', 'threepenny bit', 'flat' and 'tat head'. These are a larger nipple head with a flat sealing surface which overhangs the body of the nipple allowing the grease gun end to be hooked onto the nipple with a sliding action which wipes the nipple surface as it's attached. The grease gun hose is usually at a sharp angle (e.g. 70-90°) to the axis of the nipple but can be approached from any azimuthal angle. It is not possible for grease pressure to force this type of connector away from the nipple. Grease fittings are commonly made from zinc- plated steel, stainless steel, or brass. History Saturday Evening Post, 1921. At the time of this advertisement, the fittings were of the flat-top type, but Zerk fittings would soon appear. The patent for the Zerk fitting was granted to Oscar U. Zerk in January 1929, and the assignee was the Alemite Manufacturing Corporation.Lubricant fitting. US Patent 1697217 Alemite had already been marketing, since 1919, Automobile Engineering Volume II Prepared By a Staff of Automobile Experts, Consulting Engineers of the Highest Professional Standing Published by American Technical Society, Chicago, 1920 ball check valves to accept grease supplied under pressure from a grease gun, such as for car and truck chassis lubrication points, both for OEM installations and for aftermarket upgrade kits which would screw in as replacements for stock grease cups, but Zerk's fitting was an improved style, less vulnerable to dirt and more forgiving of angled approach. Today, many companies make these grease fittings. Before Zerk fittings existed, bearings were lubricated in various other ways that tended to be more maintenance- intensive and often provided less effective lubrication. For example, a typical machinery bearing of the 19th and early 20th centuries was a plain bearing with a cross-drilled hole to receive oil or grease, with no clever fitting at its mouth, or at best a cap or cup. Often lubricant was delivered under no more pressure than gravity or a finger push might provide. For example, oil was gravity-fed into the hole, or grease was pushed in. Grease guns to feed the grease with higher pressure existed, but their pre-Zerk fittings were not as good for making clean, sealed contact easily, and they were less widely used than today. The oil hole or grease hole was usually covered with a cap of some kind to keep dirt out, from a simple plug or screw to a spring-loaded hinged cap. Sometimes a cup was mounted, acting as a small reservoir, which could be turned at regular intervals to inject grease into the fitting. The standard mode of maintenance was to have each machine's operator, or a dedicated oiler, go around adding a small squirt of oil or blob of grease to each and every hole on a frequent basis. Typical frequencies for oiling were one oil squirt (to every bearing) for each day of use, or in some cases each week. Grease is essentially oil held in a viscous gel or cream whose viscosity is used to hold the oil over time in places where oil alone cannot be supplied constantly enough, and would quickly drip away without the viscous suspension. This trait makes it better for bearings that cannot practically receive new oil on a near-constant basis. Thus a typical frequency for greasing might be monthly, yearly, or every several years. If the lubrication schedule was faithfully and conscientiously adhered to, the lubrication quality could be very good. Large marine engines and stationary engines to power whole factories were likeliest to get such top-quality care. But locomotives, rail cars, agricultural implements, and automobiles were less certain of good care, and lubrication quality without constant lubing tended to be intermittent, from mediocre to bad. Attempts to improve on the simple oil hole concept included putting a small reservoir of oil above the hole, which slowly dripped oil into it. An example is the Lunkenheimer oiler in the nearby image. Such oilers often incorporated one or more of the following features: * A wick (to hold the oil and allow it to be drawn down slowly by capillary action, just as an oil-lamp wick or candle wick fed oil or melted wax to its flame * A fine mesh screen to act as a filter to keep dirt from getting down the hole * A glass cup rather than a metal one, which allowed an operator or oiler to see at a glance how low the oil level was A typical engine oiler This is one made by Lunkenheimer For greased bearings, the low pressures of lubrication before the grease fitting could often result in a failure of the grease to travel all the way down into all the voids of the bearing. The grease fitting improved this penetration, yielding more effective lubrication. Use Since the 1920s, the ever-growing proliferation of sealed bearings throughout the manufacturing industries has made the use of grease fittings less common. Sealed bearings are lubricated for life at the factory, and are sealed such that the lubricant is not lost or dirtied. Grease fittings are far from obsolete, however, and much new machinery is built with them every year (e.g., tractors, lawnmowers, industrial plant equipment, and still a few car and truck parts). As long as maintenance is even minimally attended to (via occasional lube jobs where new grease is pumped into the bearing), this type of bearing and lubrication setup is cost-effective, simple, and long-lasting. Norton Commando motorcycles (1967–1975) had a 'grease' nipple fitted to the swing arm assembly but heavy gear box oil was stipulated by the factory. The subsequent confusion by owners often resulted in grease being used (causing rapid wear of the pivot bushes).

It commemorates the day when Pakistan achieved independence and was declared a sovereign state following the end of the British Raj in 1947. Pakistan came into existence as a result of the Pakistan Movement, which aimed for the creation of an independent Muslim state in the north-western regions of British India via partition. The movement was led by the All-India Muslim League under the leadership of Muhammad Ali Jinnah. The event was brought forth by the Indian Independence Act 1947 under which the British Raj gave independence to the Dominion of Pakistan which comprised West Pakistan (present-day Pakistan) and East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). In the Islamic calendar, the day of independence coincided with Ramadan 27, the eve of which, being Laylat al-Qadr, is regarded as sacred by Muslims. The main Independence Day ceremony takes place in Islamabad, where the national flag is hoisted at the Presidential and Parliament buildings. It is followed by the national anthem and live televised speeches by leaders. Usual celebratory events and festivities for the day include flag-raising ceremonies, parades, cultural events, and the playing of patriotic songs. A number of award ceremonies are often held on this day, and Pakistanis hoist the national flag atop their homes or display it prominently on their vehicles and attire.

The East India Company begun their trade in colonial India in the 17th century, and the company rule started from 1757 when they won the Battle of Plassey. Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the Government of India Act 1858 led to the British Crown assuming direct control over much of the Indian subcontinent. All-India Muslim League was founded by the All India Muhammadan Educational Conference at Dhaka, in 1906, in the context of the circumstances that were generated over the division of Bengal in 1905 and the party aimed at creation of a separate Muslim state.Jalal, Ayesha (1994) The Sole Spokesman: Jinnah, the Muslim League and the Demand for Pakistan. Cambridge University Press. The period after World War I was marked by British reforms such as the Montagu-ford Reforms, but it also witnessed the enactment of the repressive Rowlatt Act and strident calls for self-rule by Indian activists. The widespread discontent of this period crystallized into nationwide non-violent movements of non-cooperation and civil disobedience. The idea for a separate Muslim state in the northwest regions of South Asia was introduced by Allama Iqbal in his speech as the President of the Muslim League in December 1930.Shafique Ali Khan (1987), Iqbal's Concept of Separate North-west Muslim State: A Critique of His Allahabad Address of 1930, Markaz- e-Shaoor-o-Adab, Karachi, OCLC 18970794 Three years later, the name of \\"Pakistan\\" as a separate state was proposed in a declaration made by Chaudhary Rahmat Ali, in the form of an acronym. It was to comprise the five \\"northern units\\" of Punjab, Afghania (erstwhile North-West Frontier Province), Kashmir, Sindh, and Baluchistan. Like Iqbal, Bengal was left out of the proposal made by Rehmat Ali.Choudhary Rahmat Ali, (1933), Now or Never; Are We to Live or Perish Forever?, pamphlet, published 28 January In the 1940s, as the Indian independence movement intensified, an upsurge of Muslim nationalism helmed by the All-India Muslim League took place, of which Muhammad Ali Jinnah was the most prominent leader. Being a political party to secure the interests of the Muslim diaspora in British India, the Muslim League played a decisive role during the 1940s in the Indian independence movement and developed into the driving force behind the creation of Pakistan as a Muslim state in South Asia. During a three-day general session of All-India Muslim League from 22–24 March 1940, a formal political statement was presented, known as the Lahore Resolution, which called on for the creation of an independent state for Muslims. In 1956, 23 March also became the date on which Pakistan transitioned from a dominion to a republic, and is known as Pakistan Day. =Independence= In 1946, the Labour government in Britain, exhausted by recent events such as World War II and numerous riots, realized that it had neither the mandate at home, the support internationally, nor the reliability of the British Indian Army for continuing to control an increasingly restless British India. The reliability of the native forces for continuing their control over an increasingly rebellious India diminished, and so the government decided to end the British rule of the Indian Subcontinent. In 1946, the Indian National Congress, being a secular party, demanded a single state. The All India Muslim League, who disagreed with the idea of single state, stressed the idea of a separate Pakistan as an alternative. The 1946 Cabinet Mission to India was sent to try to reach a compromise between Congress and the Muslim League, proposing a decentralized state with much power given to local governments, but it was rejected by both of the parties and resulted in a number of riots in South Asia.*Wolpert, Stanley. 2006. Shameful Flight: The Last Years of the British Empire in India. Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press. 272 pages. . Eventually, in February 1947, Prime Minister Clement Attlee announced that the British government would grant full self-governance to British India by June 1948 at the latest. On 3 June 1947, the British government announced that the principle of division of British India into two independent states was accepted. The successor governments would be given dominion status and would have an implicit right to secede from the British Commonwealth. Viceroy Mountbatten chose 15 August, the second anniversary of Japan's surrender in the World War II, as the date of power transfer. He chose 14 August as the date of the ceremony of power transfer to Pakistan because he wanted to attend the ceremonies in both India and Pakistan. The Indian Independence Act 1947 (10 & 11 Geo 6 c. 30) passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom divided British India into the two new independent dominions; the Dominion of India (later to become the Republic of India) and the Dominion of Pakistan (later to become the Islamic Republic of Pakistan). The act provided a mechanism for division of the Bengal and Punjab provinces between the two nations (see partition of India), establishment of the office of the Governor-General, conferral of complete legislative authority upon the respective Constituent Assemblies, and division of joint property between the two new countries. The act later received royal assent on 18 July 1947. The partition was accompanied by violent riots and mass casualties, and the displacement of nearly 15 million people due to religious violence across the subcontinent; millions of Muslim, Sikh and Hindu refugees trekked the newly drawn borders to Pakistan and India respectively in the months surrounding independence. On 14 August 1947, the new Dominion of Pakistan became independent and Muhammad Ali Jinnah was sworn in as its first governor general in Karachi. Independence was marked with widespread celebration, but the atmosphere remained heated given the communal riots prevalent during independence in 1947. =The date of independence= Since the transfer of power took place on the midnight of 14 and 15 August, the Indian Independence Act 1947 recognized 15 August as the birthday of both Pakistan and India. The act states; Jinnah in his first broadcast to the nation stated; The first commemorative postage stamps of the country, released in July 1948, also gave 15 August 1947 as the independence day, however in subsequent years 14 August was adopted as the independence day. This is because Mountbatten administered the independence oath to Jinnah on the 14th, before leaving for India where the oath was scheduled on the midnight of the 15th. The night of 14–15 August 1947 coincided with 27 Ramadan 1366 of the Islamic calendar, which Muslims regard as a sacred night. Celebrations =Official celebrations= The independence day is one of the six public holidays observed in Pakistan and is celebrated all across the country. To prepare and finalise the plans for independence day celebrations, meetings are held in the provincial capitals by local governments which are attended by government officials, diplomats, and politicians. Public organisations, educational institutions, and government departments organise seminars, sports competitions, and social and cultural activities leading up to the independence day. In Karachi, drives are initiated to clean and prepare the Mazar-e-Quaid (Jinnah Mausoleum) for the celebration. The official festivities take place in Islamabad and commence with the raising of the national flag on the Parliament House and the Presidency followed by a 31-gun salute in the capital and a 21-gun salute in provincial capitals. The President and Prime Minister of Pakistan address the nation in live telecasts. Government officials, political leaders and celebrities deliver messages or speeches during rallies, ceremonies and events, highlighting Pakistani achievements, goals set for the future, and praise the sacrifices and efforts of national heroes. Government buildings including the Parliament House, Supreme Court, President House and Prime Minister's Secretariat are decorated and illuminated with lights and bright colours. A change of guard takes place at national monuments by the Armed Forces. The Army, Air Force and Navy feature prominently in independence day parades. In the cities around the country, the flag hoisting ceremony is carried out by the nazim (mayor) belonging to the respective constituency, and at various public and private departments the ceremony is conducted by a senior officer of that organisation. In 2017, the Pakistan International Airlines introduced a special in-flight jam session to entertain passengers traveling on Independence Day, featuring artists singing national songs on board a domestic flight. International governments, leaders and public figures also convey their greetings on the occasion. Overseas dignitaries are invited as chief guests in ceremonies, while foreign military contingents often participate in parades. National flags are displayed on major roads and avenues such as Shahrah-e-Faisal, Shahara-e-Quaideen, and Mazar-e-Quaid Road, leading up to Jinnah's mausoleum in Karachi. Minar-e- Pakistan in Lahore, where the Pakistan Resolution was passed in 1940, is fully illuminated on the eve of the independence day to signify its importance in the creation of Pakistan. =Public celebrations= As the month of August begins, special stalls, fun fairs and shops are set up across the country for the sale of national flags, buntings, banners and posters, badges, pictures of national heroes, multimedia and other celebratory items. Vehicles, private buildings, homes, and streets are decorated with national flags, candles, oil lamps, pennants and buntings. Businesses engage in rigorous marketing, as do leading designer fashion outlets which stock independence-themed clothing, jewellery and self-adornments. The day begins with special prayers for the integrity, solidarity, and development of Pakistan in mosques and religious places across the country. Citizens attending independence day parades and other events are usually dressed in Pakistan's official colours, green and white. Many people meet their friends and relatives, dine over Pakistani food, and visit recreational spots to mark the holiday. Public functions including elaborate firework shows, street parades, seminars, televised transmissions, music and poetry contests, children's shows and art exhibitions are a common part of the celebrations. Along with flag hoisting, the national anthem is sung at various government places, schools, residences, and monuments on the day, and patriotic slogans such as Pakistan Zindabad are raised. Musical concerts and dance performances are arranged both inside and outside the country, featuring popular artists. Homage is paid to the people who lost their lives during the migration and riots which followed independence in 1947, as well as martyrs of the Pakistan Army and recipients of Nishan-e- Haider, and political figures, famous artists and scientists. Immigrant communities in Pakistan partake in the festivities as well. The Pakistani diaspora around the world organises cultural events to celebrate independence day; public parades are held in cities with large Pakistani populations, such as New York, London and Dubai. In addition, Kashmiris from Jammu and Kashmir who hold pro-Pakistan sentiments are known to observe the day, causing friction with Indian authorities. Security measures Security measures in the country are intensified as the independence day approaches, especially in major cities and in troubled areas. The security is set up after various representatives of intelligence and investigation agencies meet. High alert is declared in sensitive areas such as the country's capital, to restrict security threats. Despite this, there have been instances where attacks have occurred on independence day by insurgents who boycott the celebrations as a part of their protest. On 13 August 2010, the country witnessed floods causing deaths of 1,600 people and affecting 14 million lives. On account of the calamity, the president made an announcement that there would not be any official celebration of the independence day that year. In popular culture From the beginning of August, radio channels play milli naghmay (patriotic songs) and various TV shows and programmes highlighting the history, culture, and achievements of Pakistan are broadcast. Popular national songs like Dil Dil Pakistan and Jazba-e-Junoon are played and sung all over the country. New patriotic songs are also released each year. The film Jinnah released in 1998 follows the story of Jinnah and details the events leading up to the independence of Pakistan. The events during the independence of Pakistan are depicted in many literary and scholarly works. Khushwant Singh's novel Train to Pakistan, Saadat Hasan Manto's short story Toba Tek Singh, Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre's book Freedom at Midnight, and poetic works of Faiz Ahmad Faiz chronicle events during the independence of Pakistan. Ali Pur Ka Aeeli by Mumtaz Mufti is an autobiography narrating the account of bringing his family from Batala to Lahore. Khaak aur Khoon (Dirt and Blood) by Naseem Hijazi describes the sacrifices of Muslims of South Asia during independence. Dastaan, a Pakistani drama serial, based on the novel Bano by Razia Butt, also tells the story of Pakistan Movement and events surrounding the independence of Pakistan. Pakistan Post released four commemorative stamps in July 1948 for the country's first independence anniversary. Three of the four stamps depicted places from Pakistan while the fourth stamp depicted a motif. The stamps were inscribed \\"15th August 1947\\" because of the prevailing confusion of actual date of independence. In 1997, Pakistan celebrated its 50th anniversary of independence. The State Bank of Pakistan issued a special banknote of rupee 5 depicting the tomb of Baha-ud-din Zakariya on 13 August 1997, commemorating the 50th independence day. On the front of the note a star burst is encircled by Fifty Years Anniversary of Freedom in Urdu and '1947–1997' in numerals. In November 1997, the 1997 Wills Golden Jubilee Tournament was held in Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore to mark the golden jubilee. During the final of the tournament, Pakistan Cricket Board honoured all the living test cricket captains of Pakistan by parading them in horse-drawn carriages and presenting them with gold medals. On 14 August 2004, Pakistan displayed the largest flag of the time with the dimensions of . Since 2011, the Google Pakistan homepage has featured special doodles designed with Pakistani symbols to mark Pakistan's Independence Day. Such symbols have included the star and crescent, national monuments and colours, historic and artistic representations, geographic landscapes and other national symbols. Facebook allows its users in Pakistan to post an independence day status with a Pakistani flag icon on it; or greets users in the country with a special message on the home page.

The Star Atlas covers the entire northern and southern sky, with accompanying reference information for amateur astronomers. The charts used in the first 17 editions of the Atlas were drawn by a British schoolmaster, Arthur Philip Norton (1876–1955), after whom the Atlas was named. Norton intended his star atlas to be used in conjunction with the highly popular observing handbooks written by the British astronomers William Henry Smyth and Thomas William Webb, and consequently most of the objects featured in those guidebooks were marked on the charts. The Atlas also found favour among professional astronomers, earning it the reputation of the most widely used and best-known celestial atlas of its day. Arrangement and projection Norton’s Star Atlas became highly popular because of its convenient arrangement of dividing the sky into six vertical slices, or gores, like portions of a globe. Each gore covered 4 hours of right ascension, from declination 60 degrees north to 60 degrees south, drawn on a projection specially designed by Norton. The north and south polar regions of the sky were covered by separate charts on a standard azimuthal equidistant projection, extending from the celestial poles to declination 50 degrees north and south. Early editions For the first edition, Norton based his charts on the Uranométrie Générale star catalogue compiled by the Belgian astronomer Jean-Charles Houzeau. Constellation boundaries were represented by dashed lines meandering between the stars, for no official boundaries were then established. For the 5th edition of the Atlas, published in 1933, Norton completely redrew the charts, despite now suffering from severely impaired vision in his left eye due to a blood clot behind the retina. This time he used the Harvard Revised Photometry catalogue for the positions and brightnesses of the stars. In this 5th edition the Milky Way was included for the first time, and he incorporated the official constellation boundaries that had been laid down by the International Astronomical Union in 1930. Norton redrew his charts yet again for the 9th edition published in 1943, extending the magnitude limit of the stars from 6.2 to 6.35. Positions were now given for the standard epoch of 1950, as against 1920 previously. The 9th edition charts remained in use up to and including the 17th edition of Norton’s Star Atlas published in 1978, long after Norton’s death. The handbook In addition to the charts, Norton’s Star Atlas also contained a reference section featuring practical information and data of particular interest to observers. Most of this text was the work of the publisher and various expert contributors. With each passing edition, the text grew into a reference handbook as essential for amateur astronomers as the charts themselves. Modern era By the 1980s, Norton’s Star Atlas had come to look dated. In 1989 a totally new edition was published, the 18th, under the title Norton’s 2000.0 to emphasize that its charts had been redrawn to the new standard epoch of 2000. Sadly from then, it is no longer printed on stout paper unlike previous editions. Resulting in the atlas not being very suitable for use on a dew laden night. These charts were computer-plotted by the cartographic company of John Bartholomew and Son Ltd. in Edinburgh, Scotland, taking star positions and brightnesses from the most recent version of the Bright Star Catalogue, the successor to the Harvard Revised Photometry. The total number of stars plotted was over 8800, reaching to magnitude 6.5. The text was extensively rewritten and reorganized under the editorship of the British astronomy writer Ian Ridpath. For the first time in its history, Norton’s Star Atlas contained nothing by Norton himself. A further break with the past came with the 20th edition in 2003 when publication of the title moved to New York, although the editor and contributors remained in the UK. For this edition the charts were replotted and the reference section heavily revised to reflect the latest advances in amateur astronomy.

They are native to tropical eastern Asia, from India to China and south through Southeast Asia to northern Indonesia. Taxonomy and systematics While some older sources merge this genus into Hypsipetes, this is neither advisable nor technically correct. The two genera stand well apart, and to phylogenetically justify their merging, the entire \\"Hypsipetes group\\" of bulbuls would need to be united in a single genus. That would include Hemixos, Ixos, Microscelis and Tricholestes, and probably also Alophoixus and the monotypic Setornis. The hook-billed bulbul may in fact be the closest living relative to the species in Iole, but altogether the present genus may well be a quite basal lineage of the traditional \\"Hypsipetes group\\" of bulbuls, with no particularly close relatives among any of these other genera.Gregory (2000), Pasquet et al. (2001), Moyle & Marks (2006) According to mtDNA NADH dehydrogenase subunits 2 and 3 and nDNA β-fibrinogen intron 7 sequence data Alophoixus is only slightly more distant from Hypsipetes than Iole is, whereas mtDNA 12S rRNA and 16S rRNA sequence data places it actually closer to Hypsipetes than to Iole. As the genus name Ixos pre-dates Hypsipetes, it would thus apply to such a thoroughly merged \\"wastebin taxon\\". =Extant species= The following seven species are currently recognized: * Finsch's bulbul (Iole finschii; formerly Alophoixus finschii) * Sulphur-bellied bulbul (Iole palawanensis) * Olive bulbul (Iole viridescens) * Buff-vented bulbul (Iole crypta) * Charlotte's bulbul (Iole charlottae) * Cachar bulbul (Iole cacharensis) * Grey-eyed bulbul (Iole propinqua) =Former species= Formerly, some authorities also considered the following species (or subspecies) as species within the genus Iole: * Yellow- browed bulbul (as Iole indica) * Yellow-browed bulbul (icterica) (as Iole icterica) * Cinereous bulbul (as Iole cinerea) * Mindoro bulbul (as Iole Mindorensis) * Visayan bulbul (as Iole Guimarasensis) * Zamboanga bulbul (as Iole rufigularis) * Streak-breasted bulbul (as Iole siquijorensis) * Romblon bulbul (as Iole cinereiceps) * Cebu bulbul (as Iole monticola) Footnotes References * Gregory, Steven M.

It spans just over one year, beginning when she is 12 years old and her family moves from Plum Creek, Minnesota to what will become De Smet, South Dakota. The novel was a Newbery Honor book in 1940, as were the fourth through eighth books in the series. Story The novel is based on Laura's late childhood spent near De Smet, South Dakota, beginning in 1879. Because her sister, Mary, was recently blinded due to an illness, Pa asks Laura to \\"be Mary’s eyes\\" by describing what she sees, and she becomes more patient and mature through this service. The novel also introduces Laura's youngest sister, Grace. The story begins in Plum Creek, shortly after the Ingalls have recovered from the scarlet fever which caused Mary to become blind. Aunt Docia comes to visit, and suggests that Pa work as the bookkeeper in Uncle Henry's railroad camp for fifty dollars a month. Since Mary is too weak to travel, Pa went ahead with the wagon and team, and the rest of the family followed later by train. The morning Pa is to leave, their beloved old bulldog, Jack, dies in his sleep, saddening Laura greatly. (The dog upon whom he was based was no longer with the Ingalls at that point, but Laura inserted his death here to serve as a transition between her childhood and her adolescence.) Several months later, Ma and the children travel to Dakota Territory by train. This is their first train trip and they are excited by the novelty of this newfangled mode of transportation, which can cover in a few hours the distance a horse and wagon would travel in a day. Pa comes for them in town, and the next day they leave for the railroad camp. Laura and her cousin, Lena, play together when they are done with their chores, which range from collecting laundry washed by a neighbor to milking cows; Laura rides a horse for the first time when Lena allows her the use of her pony. As winter approaches, the railroad workers demolish the buildings in the camp and return east. As the Ingalls have nowhere to stay post-demolition, they plan to return east too, but the surveyors, who had planned to stay for the winter, are called back east and ask them to stay in their house in exchange for keeping watch over their surveying equipment. Laura is excited to move into a beautiful house well stocked with provisions. The newly married Mr. and Mrs. Boast arrive in the middle of a snowstorm. They stay past Christmas, and at New Year's the Ingalls visit the Boasts' small home for dinner. To pass time, Mrs. Boast shares her collection of newspapers with Laura and shows the Ingalls how to make a what-not. Later, Reverend Alden unexpectedly visits, and after learning Mary is blind, informs Ma that there is a college for the blind in Iowa. Laura resolves that she will eventually teach school and help send Mary to college. During a clear night that winter, Laura and Carrie go for a moonlight walk on the lake and encounter a wolf. When Pa goes out the next day to hunt it, he discovers the perfect section of land for their homestead claim. He plans to file on it at the land office in Brookings as soon as the weather improves. However, his departure is delayed by a rush of men moving west who must also stay in the surveyors' building. The money earned from boarding them is later used for Mary's college education. After Pa's return from Brookings, he builds a store building in town so his family can move when the surveyors return. The novel ends as the Ingalls settle into the snug claim shanty on their new land. Historical background To encourage settlement of the midwest part of the United States, Congress passed the Homestead Act in 1862. It divided unsettled land into sections, and heads of households could file a claim for very little money. A section was , and a claim was ¼ of a section (160 acres). 36 sections made a township. A section was identified by three numbers, for example NW quarter of Section 18, Township 109, Range 38. By paying $10.00 plus other filing fees, a man could get of land for his use if he could live on it for 5 years and not give up to go back east. The Ingalls staked one claim near Plum Creek. In the spring of 1880, Charles filed a homestead claim south of De Smet for the NE quarter of Section 3, Township 110, Range 56.Wade, Homesteading on the Plains, pp.11-16 A few details in the novel differ from accounts in more autobiographical sources. For example, it seems that Laura never actually visited the railroad grade, but in the novel she went to the grade with her father.Anderson, A Little House Reader p. 19 She also wrote that the surveyors left food in the house when they moved in and let the Ingalls have it. However, other sources are contradictory and it is unclear whether Pa had to buy the supplies for winter.Anderson, A Little House Reader, p. 21, indicates that he purchased the food; Miller, Becoming Laura Ingalls Wilder, p.49, indicates that the food was given in exchange for caring for the property.  Reception  Virginia Kirkus had handled Ingalls Wilder's debut novel Little House in the Big Woods for Harper & Brothers as its book editor from 1926 to 1932. In Kirkus Reviews, her semimonthly bulletin from 1933, she awarded this novel a starred review (as she did its two predecessors and one successor, books 3 to 6 and no others). She assessed it frankly as the bookshop's advisor: \\"One always hesitates as to whether these stories of Laura Wilder's childhood belong with fiction or non-fiction, so place this where you have found the others sell best. ...A splendidly written contribution to factual frontier material, of special interest to the Middle Western market.\\" The novel was the second of five Newbery Honor books for Wilder, books 4 to 8 in the series. Modern influence The Surveyors' House is a Laura Ingalls Wilder historic site in De Smet, South Dakota Today, De Smet, South Dakota, attracts many fans with its historic sites from the novels By the Shores of Silver Lake, The Long Winter, Little Town on the Prairie, These Happy Golden Years, and The First Four Years. From 1879 to 1894 the Ingalls lived there. Their homestead, a house in town built by Pa, the Brewster School where Laura taught, and the surveyors' house they lived in between 1879 and 1880 are open to visitors. In addition to the Little House books, four series of books expand them to include five generations of Wilder's family. Their success has produced many related books including two series (\\"Little House Chapter Books\\" and \\"My First Little House Books\\") that present the original stories in condensed and simplified form for younger readers. Additional series have been written by other authors to tell the stories of Wilder's mother (“The Caroline Years ”), grandmother (\\"The Charlotte Years\\"), great-grandmother (“The Martha Years”), and daughter (“The Rose Years”). There are also Little House-themed craft, music, and cookbooks. References Bibliography * Anderson, William. A Little House Reader. New York: Harper Collins publishers. 1998. . *Anderson, William.

It is set in De Smet, South Dakota. It opens in the spring after the Long Winter, and ends as Wilder becomes a schoolteacher so she can help her sister, Mary, stay at a school for the blind in Vinton, Iowa. It tells the story of 15-year-old Wilder's first paid job outside of home and her last terms of schooling. At the end of the novel, she receives a teacher's certificate, and is employed to teach at the Brewster settlement, away. The novel was a Newbery Honor book in 1942, as the fourth to eighth Little House books all were from 1938 to 1944. Plot summary The novel opens in May 1880, after the Hard Winter. At the Ingalls' claim, Pa begins planting the corn and oats that will serve as cash crops for the family, after which he builds the second half of the claim shanty, creating two small bedrooms. Meanwhile, Ma begins planting her new vegetable garden, while Mary, Laura, and Carrie happily help with the farm chores and housework and care for their youngest sister, Grace. After gophers begin eating Pa's seed corn and a mouse cuts his hair in his sleep, the family decides to get a cat, which quickly proves to be a skilled hunter despite being taken from its mother at only five weeks old. One day at supper, Pa asks Laura whether she will accept a job in town helping to sew shirts; the surge in people newly arrived in town means a need for services such as this. She hates the work, but continues because the money will help send her sister, Mary, to a college for the blind in Iowa. On the Fourth of July, she, Carrie, and Pa walk to town to attend the celebration. The men organize horse races, and Laura's future husband, Almanzo Wilder, wins the buggy race with his two Morgan horses hitched to his brother's heavy peddler's wagon. On the homestead, the Ingalls' crops of corn and oats are doing well, and Pa plans to sell them to pay for Mary to begin college that fall, but blackbirds descend and destroy both crops. Laura and Mary resign themselves that Mary will have to delay college, but Pa sells one of their cows to make up the amount. When Ma and Pa escort her there, Laura, Carrie, and Grace are left alone for a week. In order to stave off the loneliness stemming from Mary's departure, they do the fall cleaning; they succeed despite a few mishaps, surprising Ma and Pa when they return. In the fall, the Ingalls move to town; they believe the coming winter will not be as hard as the previous one, but as the claim shanty is not weatherproofed, Pa thinks it is best not to risk staying in it. In town, Laura and Carrie attend school again, and Laura is reunited with her friends, Minnie Johnson and Mary Power. She also meets a new girl, Ida Brown, the adopted daughter of the town's new minister, Reverend Brown, who claims to be related to John Brown of Kansas. Nellie Oleson, her nemesis from Plum Creek, has moved to De Smet and is also attending the school. The teacher for the fall term is Eliza Jane Wilder, Almanzo’s older sister, who has a nearby claim of her own. Nellie turns her against Laura and Wilder loses control of the school for a time. A visit by the school board restores order; however, Wilder leaves at the end of the fall term. For the winter term, Miss Wilder is replaced by Mr. Clewett. Laura sets herself to studying, as she only has one year left before she can apply for a teaching certificate, but relaxes when the town of De Smet begins having literary meetings at the school, where the whole town gathers for fun every Friday night: singing, elocution, a spelling bee, or plays and minstrel shows put on by the townspeople. The winter is very mild, so Laura and Carrie never miss a day of school. Laura and her classmates become friendly after a birthday party for Ben Woodworth, and so she begins lagging in her studies, though she remains head of the class. She spends the summer studying to make up for lost time. The next school year, there is another new teacher, Mr. Owen. During a week of church revival meetings, Almanzo asks to escort her home from church. Ma is surprised at this because she is only fifteen, and he is a grown man. Near Christmas, Mr. Owen organizes a school exhibition to raise awareness of the school's needs, as the school is becoming overcrowded. He assigns Laura and Ida the duty of reciting the whole of American history up to that point. Despite their nervousness, on the night of the school exhibition they perform perfectly, as does Carrie, who recites a poem. Almanzo once again sees Laura home, and offers to take her on a sleigh ride after he completes the cutter he is building. At home, Laura is met by Mr. Boast and Mr. Brewster, who saw her perform at the exhibition and want her to take a teaching position at Brewster's settlement twelve miles (19 km) from town. The school superintendent comes and tests her; although she is not yet sixteen, he grants her a third-grade teaching certificate. The novel ends with her preparing to teach school. Historical context Though Wilder began writing the books as autobiographical recollections, they are considered historical fiction and have won a number of literary awards. In 1941, this novel was awarded a Newbery Honor for exceptional children’s literature. To encourage settlement of the mid-west part of the United States, Congress passed the Homestead Act in 1862. It divided unsettled land into sections, and heads of households could file a claim for very little money. A section was , and a claim was ¼ of a section. 36 sections made a township.

In spring 1880, Charles filed a homestead claim south of De Smet for the NE quarter of Section 3, Township 110, Range 56.Wade, Homesteading on the Plains, pp.11-16 The novel takes place between the summer of 1881 and December 24, 1882. Mary enrolled in the Iowa School for the Blind in Vinton on November 23, 1881. Although the Dakota territorial government paid the tuition for blind persons to attend the college, if the person was a Dakota resident, Wilder's income was still necessary to help the family financially with Mary's absence. In the context of Wilder's books, the \\"Nellie Oleson\\" here is the one from On the Banks of Plum Creek, although her character was a conflation of two girls Wilder knew: Nellie Owens in Plum Creek and Genevieve Masters here. In reality, she never saw the \\"Nellie\\" from Plum Creek again after her family left the town. Subsequent events Although the novel ends with Wilder's start as a schoolteacher, her life and that of her family continued. At age 18 she married Almanzo Wilder.Anderson, Laura's Album, p. 29 Together they homesteaded and raised horses, which he loved. They had a daughter, Rose Wilder Lane, and lost a son in infancy. Lane grew up to become an author, among other things. Wilder wrote over the years in the form of essays and articles for newspapers and magazines, mostly articles related to homesteading.Anderson, Laura's Album, pp. 41-45 She wrote out the manuscript for each of her books by hand, and Lane helped her type and edit them. The well-known illustrations by Garth Williams appeared in the revised editions about 20 years later.  Reception  Virginia Kirkus had handled Wilder's debut novel Little House in the Big Woods for Harper and Brothers as its book editor from 1926 to 1932. In Kirkus Reviews, her semimonthly bulletin from 1933, she had awarded the 3rd to 6th novels starred reviews. There would be no more. Of this novel she advised, \\"These books are written in the third person, as if they were fiction, but actually each successive volume provides another panel in Wilder's autobiography. This one is for distinctly older girls than its predecessor, as Wilder secures her first post as school teacher, and puts her own school days behind her. ... For some reason, the almost-a-young lady Wilder isn't quite as real as the child of the wilderness.\\" The novel was the fourth of five Newbery Honor books for Wilder, books 4 to 8 in the series.

It is based on her later adolescence near De Smet, South Dakota, featuring her short time as a teacher, beginning at age 15, and her courtship with Almanzo Wilder. It spans the time period from 1882 to 1885, when they marry. The novel was a Newbery Honor book in 1944, as were the previous four Little House books. Plot summary As the novel begins, Pa is taking Laura 12 miles from home in the dead of winter to her first teaching assignment at Brewster settlement. Laura being only 15 and a schoolgirl herself, is apprehensive as this is both the first time she has left home and the first school she has taught, but she is determined to complete her assignment and earn money to keep her sister Mary at her college for the blind in Iowa. The weather is bitterly cold, and neither the claim shanty where Laura boards or the school can be heated adequately. Some of the children she is teaching are older than her, and she has difficulty controlling them. Worse, she boards with the head of the school board and his unhappy wife, who does not hide her resentment of Laura. Soon Laura comes to dread living under their roof, particularly during the weekends when she can't escape to school. Much to her surprise and relief, Almanzo begins driving the twenty-four miles to and from the school so that she can return home on weekends. With advice from Ma (a former schoolteacher herself), she is able to adapt and become more self-assured, and successfully completes the two-month assignment. Laura is surprised when Almanzo continues to invite her out sleighing once she had returned home. Their relationship continues, even as she watches her school friends pairing up with beaux, accepting marriage proposals, and leaving school. Sleigh rides give way to buggy rides in the spring, and she impresses him with her willingness to help break his new and often temperamental horses. Meanwhile, she continues to study for her own education, remaining at the head of her classes while also takes odd jobs and another term of teaching in order to earn money for Mary's education. By the time Mary graduates and returns home, Laura's extra earnings have allowed the Ingalls to settle on their claim and begin a peaceful, prosperous life. Laura and Almanzo's romance continues to blossom until he offers her an engagement ring. She accepts his proposal to be married the following summer, although she wonders if she is more interested in his horses than in he himself. Her affection is tested when he announces that he must go to his family in Minnesota and will not be back until spring. She finds that life no longer feels complete without him, only to be reunited briefly on Christmas Eve, when he returns to be with her. While in Minnesota, Almanzo told his family of the engagement, and his older sister, Eliza Jane, Laura's former teacher, planned to arrive in spring to throw a huge, fancy wedding that neither Almanzo or Laura want or can afford. To stop Eliza Jane from taking over their wedding, Laura agrees to be married at the end of that week. Almanzo rushes to finish their house while she hurries to complete her trousseau. They are married quietly in a small ceremony by the local pastor. She says a tearful but loving goodbye to her family before leaving for the little house Almanzo has built for them. Historical background \\"Lew Brewster\\" was a pseudonym for Louis Bouchie. He was a distant relative of Mr. Boast, a good friend of the Ingalls who appears in several of the books. Bouchie and Genevieve Masters were the only two people whose names Wilder changed for her books, as Nellie and Louis Bouchie's wife were both unpleasant people, and she wished to respect their privacy. Today there is a small town called Carthage, South Dakota, located where Wilder placed the Brewster settlement, although it is unclear if Carthage grew out of the original Bouchie (Brewster) Settlement. Nellie Oleson, depicted in this story, is actually a combination of two of Wilder's rivals: Genevieve Masters, in the school passages, and Stella Gilbert, in the passages about the buggy rides with Wilder and Almanzo. The news Wilder hears near the end of the book, that \\"Nellie has gone back East\\", refers to Genevieve Masters.  Reception  Virginia Kirkus, Wilder's first editor at Harper, approved the novel in Kirkus Reviews as \\"a splendid addition to the other fine books in the series\\". The 3rd to 6th volumes had received starred reviews. The novel joined the 4th to 7th volumes as Newbery Honor Books.

Catherine Hall van den Elsen. Roldana, Andalucía Barroca 2007. Junta de Andalucía, Consejería de Cultura. . p. 21. - 10 January 1706), called La Roldana, was a Spanish sculptor of the Baroque Era. She is the first woman sculptor documented in Spain.[Gaze, D (ed) Dictionary of Women Artists, 1997, Fitzroy Dearborn, vol 2, pp. 1192-1195] Luisa Roldan (1650 - 1704) Artwork Images, Exhibitions, Reviews Although her dates of birth and death were discovered some years ago, many websites and publications still contain the incorrect dates. Because of the quality of her work, Antonio Palomino considered her as important a sculptor as her father. In spite serving as the court sculptor, like many artists of her time she died poor, signing a declaration of poverty shortly before her death. Life Roldán was born in Seville, the daughter of sculptor Pedro Roldán, and she was taught by her father along with her siblings. At the age of 15 she married a sculptor, Luis Antonio de los Arcos, after she worked in Cadiz from 1686 to 1688.Luisa Roldán , Getty Museum. Retrieved 2010-04-30. Her marriage to de Los Arcos was against her father's wishes. Santiago Montoto, writing in 1920, went so far as to characterize it as an \\"abduction\\" (\\"rapto\\"), perhaps revealing his lack of understanding of marriage customs of the period. Two of her sisters and one brother also encountered parental disapproval of their chosen partners. She created wooden sculptures as well as statues for the Cathedral of Cadiz and the town council. In 1688 she moved to Madrid,Her arrival there can be dated some time before 28 February 1688, when her daughter María Bernarda was baptized in the parish church of San Bernardo, Madrid. Catherine Hall van den Elsen. Roldana, Andalucía Barroca 2007. Junta de Andalucía, Consejería de Cultura. . p. 25. where she became court sculptor in 1692, serving Charles II and Philip V; she also served the Duke of Infantado and was admitted at the end of her life to the Accademia di San Luca. Nonetheless, she died in poverty in Madrid. Roldán had seven children, of whom two survived to adulthood. During her time working for Charles II, Roldán, her husband, and their children suffered from hunger due to the country's economic crisis affecting the food supply. Works Her works are strongly characterized as possessing \\"clearly delineated profiles, thick locks of hair, billowing draperies, and mystical faces with delicate eyes, knitting brows, rosy cheeks, and slightly parted lips.\\" The 'knitted brows' that are sometimes noted in her terracotta angels are not usually seen in her works in wood, which are characterised by open, evenly arched brows. Her St. Ginés de la Jara, made around 1692, is now at the Getty Center. Unlike the billowing cape of her St Michael in El Escorial, the robe worn by the Getty's San Gines is very still. Processional statues whose creation can be safely attributed to her include statues of the Virgen de la Soledad, Mary Magdalen, and Jesus.Cádiz Cofrade - Imaginería In Cadiz, works by her include statues of Anthony of Padua, Ecce Homo, and Saints Servandus and Cermanus. Roldán was a prolific sculptor. Much of her work was religious sculpture for churches, and while living in Madrid she also made small terracotta works popular with the petty bourgeoisie. Her pieces were widely distributed in Andalusia, as well as in Madrid, Móstoles and Sisante (Province of Cuenca), New York, London, Ontario, Los Angeles and Chicago. The following are among her most noted works that remain in churches: * Most Holy Mary of Silence (María Santísima del Silencio), Jaén * Carved wooden figures of San Servando and San Germán, patrons of Cádiz, in the Cádiz Cathedral * Saint Joseph, Iglesia de San Antonio, Cádiz * Saint Anthony of Padua, Iglesia de Santa Cruz, Cádiz * Saint John the Baptist, Iglesia de San Antonio de Padua, Cádiz * Our Lady of Sorrows of the Remedies (Dolorosa de los Remedios), Jerez de la Frontera * Virgin of Solitude (Virgen de la Soledad), Iglesia de la Victoria, Puerto Real * Ecce Homo, Cádiz Cathedral. 1684.

He was selected to the NFL's All-Star game twice. In 1978, he was inducted into the Greater Cleveland Sports Hall of Fame. Adams grew up in Cleveland and went to college at Ohio University. After graduating, he played four seasons for the Cleveland Rams before World War II forced the team to suspend operations in 1943. Adams was put out on loan to the Green Bay Packers, where he played for a year before joining the U.S. Army. When Adams returned from duty, the Rams had moved to Los Angeles, and he signed up to play for the Cleveland Browns, a team under formation in the AAFC. The Rams sued to prevent him from playing for the Browns, but Adams won. He stayed with Cleveland between 1946 and 1948, a span during which the team won three AAFC championships. He was then traded to the Buffalo Bills, where he stayed for a year. He played for the NFL's New York Yanks for a final year before retiring. Early life and college Adams was born in Cleveland, Ohio and attended the city's South High School. After graduating, he went to Ohio University in Athens, Ohio. Football career Adams was drafted in 1939 by the Cleveland Rams of the National Football League (NFL) and played for the team until 1942. He was selected to play in the NFL's All-Star game in 1941 and 1942. Adams then played one season for the Green Bay Packers on loan from the Rams after the Rams suspended operations during World War II. Adams joined the U.S. Army in 1944 and served for 30 months until his discharge in the summer of 1946. Adams, who was a placekicker as well as a guard, signed a contract to play for the Rams in 1946, but Rams owner Dan Reeves moved the team to Los Angeles after the 1945 season. Adams refused to move to Los Angeles with the team, and the Rams sued him in federal court after he signed with the Cleveland Browns, a team under formation in the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Adams claimed that he had no obligation under his contract to play for the Rams because the team was described as the Cleveland Rams, and its name had changed to the Los Angeles Rams following the move. The Rams filed an injunction in August 1946 to prevent him from playing for the Browns. Later that month, Adams testified before a federal court that he injured his leg in the College All-Star Game while playing for Green Bay in 1945 and was not, as the Rams claimed, a player of \\"unique ability\\". Red Conkright, a one-time Rams assistant who moved to the Browns' staff, testified that Adams was an \\"erratic\\" kicker and \\"at present a second team player\\". At the end of the month, federal judge Emerich Freed denied the Rams' injunction, allowing Adams to play for the Browns. The judge rejected the Rams' contention that Adams had signed to play for Reeves, not a specific team. He ruled the Cleveland Rams had ceased to exist, and that Adams therefore had no obligation to fulfill a contract with the Los Angeles Rams. Four other former Rams players joined the Browns along with Adams: Tommy Colella, Don Greenwood, Mike Scarry and Gaylon Smith. In the Browns' first season in 1946, Adams played on the line and shared kicking duties with Lou Groza. In a 66–14 win that December over the AAFC's Brooklyn Dodgers, he scored a touchdown on a blocked punt and kicked five extra points. The Browns advanced to the AAFC championship that year, and Adams, who had played primarily at right defensive tackle, was asked to do the team's place-kicking after Groza suffered a sprained ankle in an earlier game. The Browns beat the Yankees 14–9 in the championship game. Adams continued to play as a defensive tackle and a backup to Groza in 1947. Then 32 years old, he suffered neck and back injuries in a game against Los Angeles. He re-injured his neck in the championship game, another win over the Yankees. Adams was part of a Cleveland team that won all of its games in 1948 and ended the season by beating the Buffalo Bills for a third straight championship. The Browns traded Adams before the 1949 season to the Bills in a five-player deal. Cleveland coach Paul Brown said the team needed to stay fresh after winning three championships. Adams played a year in Buffalo, mainly as a kicker. He then played a final year for the New York Yanks of the National Football League. Later life and death Adams was inducted into the Greater Cleveland Sports Hall of Fame in 1978. He died on October 27, 1990.

It was the second-published one in the Little House series but it is not related to the first, which that of the third directly continues. Thus the later Little House on the Prairie is sometimes called the second one in the series, or the second volume of \\"the Laura Years\\". Plot summary The novel is based on the childhood of Wilder's husband, Almanzo Wilder, who grew up in the 1860s near the town of Malone, New York. It covers roughly one year of his life, beginning just before his ninth birthday and describes a full year of farming. It describes in detail the endless chores involved in running the Wilder family farm, all without powered vehicles or electricity. Young as he is, he rises before 5 am every day to milk cows and feedstock. In the growing season, he plants and tends crops; in winter, he hauls logs, helps fill the ice house, trains a team of young oxen, and sometimes—when his father can spare him—goes to school. The novel includes stories of his brother, Royal, and sisters, Eliza Jane and Alice. Historical background Since Almanzo (1857–1949) was born in February 1857, the novel is set in 1866–1867, before Laura's birth (1867–1957). It features Almanzo's brother, Royal (1847–1925), and sisters, Eliza Jane (1850–1930) and Alice (1853–1892). Meanwhile, he also had a sister named Laura (1844–1899), who at the time and events in the novel was already about 22 and had presumably moved out. He later had a brother named Perley Day (1869–1934), who was not yet born at the time the novel is set.\\"The Genealogy of Almanzo and Laura Ingalls Wilder\\". Penn (members.tripod.com/~PennyN).

Recovery Plan: Banara vanderbiltii. 1991. The flowers are yellow and have many stamens. The red-purple fruits provide food for birds, including the bananaquit (Coereba flaveola) and the western spindalis (Spindalis zena). The shrub grows in moist forests on limestone substrates. Its habitat has been subject to deforestation, the main cause of its rarity. Land is cleared for agriculture, including coffee plantations, and livestock are grazed in the area. Military exercises have also occurred nearby, with sections of the forest being trampled. The plant was known to occur near San Juan long ago, but these occurrences have long since been extirpated by urban development. It now occurs only in one area along the northwestern coast, with one tiny population located near Cayey and a second, smaller one near Bayamón. The plant was discovered in 1899 and named for Cornelius Vanderbilt, who financed plant-collecting expeditions.

Polednice is based on the noon demon \\"Lady Midday\\" of Slavic mythology. It is one of a set of late orchestral works inspired by national themes which were written after his return to his native Bohemia from the United States.  \\"Lady Midday\\" Synopsis  A mother warns her son that if he does not behave she will summon the Noon Witch to take him away. He does not behave, and the witch arrives at the stroke of noon. The witch, described as a horrible creature, demands the child. The mother, terrified that the witch has actually come, grabs her son, and the witch begins chasing them. Finally the mother faints, grasping her child. Later that day, the father arrives home, and finds his wife passed out with the dead body of their son in her arms. The mother had accidentally smothered their son while protecting him from the witch. The story ends with the father's lament over the terrible event. See also *Erlkönig (Schubert)  Composition  The piece is scored for the standard 19th-century symphony orchestra with the addition of a bass clarinet and tubular bell. Dvořák's music follows the story closely and the orchestration is often used to illustrate characters and events: the oboe and bass clarinet are used to depict the misbehaving child and the witch respectively, whilst twelve strokes of a bell signal the coming of noon. During the witch's chase, the music alternates between two different time signatures as a further dramatic device. A semi-public performance was given at the Prague Conservatory on 3 June 1896 under Antonín Bennewitz. Its first full public première was on 21 November 1896, in London, under the baton of Henry Wood. The piece lasts about 13 minutes.

Bartsia grows in damp places, such as marshes and wet meadows, in several parts of the west of England and Wales and in southwest Scotland. Etymology Bartsia was named after Johann Bartsch (Latinized as Johannes Bartsius, 1709-1738), a botanist of Königsberg. The plant was named for him by his associate Carl Linnaeus, and the genus has been sometimes spelt as Bartschia. Starbia, an anagram of Bartsia, is another genus of Orobanchaceae, synonym of Alectra. Phylogeny The phylogeny of the genera of Rhinantheae has been explored using molecular characters. Bartsia belongs to the core Rhinantheae. Bartsia sensu stricto (e.g. B. alpina) is the sister genus to Odontites, Bellardia, Tozzia, Hedbergia, and Euphrasia. Classification In 1990, the genus was revised to contain 49 species; 45 of them are endemic to the Andes. The most familiar species might be the well-studied Bartsia alpina, which has a circumboreal distribution, occurring throughout northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. There are also two afromontane species, restricted to the mountains of northeastern Africa: Bartsia decurva and Bartsia longiflora. These two plants, B. alpina, and the many Andean species are three distinct lineages, making the genus polyphyletic. As a solution to the problem of Bartsia polyphyly, two taxonomic adjustments have been proposed. # All South American species are reclassified into the new genus Neobartsia. This new name keeps traceability with Bartsia while incorporating information about its New World distribution (in ancient Greek, , i.e. , means 'new'). # The two African species Bartsia decurva and Bartsia longiflora are reclassified into the existing genus Hedbergia.

Mullard joined the IEE as a student member in 1903, became a full member in 1910, and a fellow of the IEE in 1928. In 1909, following the bankruptcy of the Mackey company, Mullard went to work first for a lamp company in Paris, and then joined the Ediswan company in Ponders End, north London, where in 1913 he was put in charge of the lamp laboratory.Lewis J.(2001), London's Lea Valley: More Secrets Revealed, Phillimore, During World War I, Mullard was commissioned as a Captain in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve and served at HMS Vernon as a research engineer, helping to develop high power valves made from silica rather than glass. Mullard Radio Valve Company In September 1920, Mullard established the Mullard Radio Valve Company. The company moved to Hammersmith in 1921, followed by a move to Balham in 1923. Mullard ended up owning 6 factories. He said that all his money came from royalties from valves and other patents. In 1925, Mullard sold half the shares in the Mullard company to Philips, with the remainder of the company being acquired by Philips in 1927. Mullard remained as managing director of the Mullard company until his resignation in 1930. During the General Strike, workers in his Lancashire factory either walked or rode to work. None struck. Mullard was noted for spending a great deal of his working time on the factory floors, garnering information from his workers about improving methods of production. If workers were not performing well, they would receive two weeks holiday pay, and be expected to perform upon return. More senior management were given four weeks leave of absence.

Career Bergantine was born October 3, 1909. His birth name, Biagio Bergantino, became Americanized over time, first to Barny, and finally to Borney Bergantine. He was the son of Italian immigrants Nicholas and Anna Bergantino who moved to Kansas City from New York City two years before he was born. Bergantine attended Central Business College and was a graduate of Manuel High School. He was active in Italian-American affairs as editor of The American Tribune, a newspaper devoted to the interests of that community. Bergantine was blind in the right eye, the result of a play injury with a toy umbrella as a toddler. A fall in a tree while in Italy as a boy caused one of his legs not to thrive. The limp that developed was offset by a cane which Bergantine came to rely on to get around. He was married in 1935. Bergantine was granted membership into ASCAP, the American Society of Composers and Publishers. Bergantine’s songwriting included other original works such as \\"Why Am I Losing You\\" and \\"Forever With You.\\" These were recorded following the success of \\"My Happiness.\\" Bergantine also collaborated locally to write \\"Watch Your Step,\\" which became a national safety song. Bergantine died July 4, 1952 at the age of 42. He was a lifelong Kansas City resident except for six years in Italy as a youngster. His last home, shared with his wife, Vita, and their two children, Patty and Billy, was at 4234 Grand Avenue North. \\"My Happiness,\\" was played at Bergantine’s funeral. \\"My Happiness\\" Bergantine was orchestra leader of \\"The Happiness Boys\\", a Kansas City band of the 1930s. This was the time of the Great Depression. \\"My Happiness\\" was played by \\"The Happiness Boys\\" wherever they performed. It was several years before the song itself, which Bergantine wrote about 1931, was recorded on an independent label. \\"My Happiness\\" was selected for the flip side of a record for a hit song. It was recorded by Jon and Sondra Steele on Damon Records and released in January 1948. Bergantine shared musical credits with Betty Peterson. He was credited for melody. Peterson, the wife of music publisher Louis Blasco, was credited for lyrics. The flip side, which was \\"My Happiness,\\" was the side people wanted to hear. The listening public fell in love with it. \\"My Happiness\\" swept the record stores. It became a top song, winding up No. 2 on the charts. \\"My Happiness\\" also has the fame of being the first song Elvis Presley ever recorded. Presley recorded the then five-year-old song at Sun Studios in Memphis on July 18, 1953—a year after Bergantine's death. Elvis's Sun recordings, made over a three-year period beginning with \\"My Happiness,\\" were inducted into the US Congress National Recording Registry in 2002. Jon & Sondra Steele who recorded the first version remade the song in 1970 and it was produced by Paul Marshall, a former member of the psychedelic band of the 60s-the Strawberry Alarm Clock. The first cover was by the Pied Pipers which featured Jo Stafford. Connie Francis successfully recorded \\"My Happiness\\" for MGM in 1959. \\"My Happiness\\" has been sung by many other artists including Ella Fitzgerald, Jim Reeves, Frank Sinatra, Andy Williams and Pat Boone.

It is located on René-Lévesque Boulevard West between Mountain Street and Lucien L'Allier Street in Downtown Montreal. It derives its name from the fact that its construction was part of a program grant from the Government of Quebec to promote the development of employment in the field of information technology. The complex provided incentives to firms specializing in electronic commerce. History The Parti Québécois government launched the Cité du Multimédia in June 1998, which was seen as a relative success of job creation despite the progressive scaling down of the program. In its wake, the government launched the E-Commerce in May 2000. These projects upset members of Montreal's real-estate community and some high-tech entrepreneurs because it forced companies to relocate to E-Commerce Place and Cité Multimédia in order to receive tax assistance. Both programs have also been criticized for promoting the construction of buildings rather than the subsidization of employment and, as a result, moving around existing jobs instead of creating new ones. The grant program was cancelled in 2003 following the election of the Quebec Liberal Party. This led to the cancellation of three other planned phases of the E-Commerce Place complex. Architecture The first tower, located at 1350 René-Lévesque Boulevard West (corner Mountain Street), has 27 floors and was completed in early 2003. Its primary tenant is CGI Group, an Information technology consulting firm. The second phase tower located at 1360 René Lévesque (corner Lucien L'Allier Street), has 17 floors and was completed in spring 2004. Tenants in the second tower include Laurentian Bank of Canada.

At the start of his mission, Durham's mission president was John A. Widtsoe. On his mission, Durham met Widtsoe's daughter, Leah Eudora Widtsoe, whom he would later marry in the Salt Lake Temple. Durham's second mission president, Joseph F. Merrill, encouraged him to pursue graduate education when he returned to the United States. =Education and academia= Durham earned a B.A. in political science and history from the University of Utah. Durham earned a Ph.D. in political science from the University of California, Los Angeles. He became a professor at the University of Utah. Durham would serve as the first head of the university's Political Science Department. He later served as the academic vice-president of the University of Utah. From 1960 to 1969, he was the president of Arizona State University. Under his presidency the university increased both in size and academic standing. From 1969 to 1976, he was the first commissioner and executive officer of the Utah System of Higher Education. General authority The Arizona State University Language and Literature Building was named for Durham in 1994 After he retired, Durham was appointed as a general authority of the LDS Church. He had previously served in the church as a stake president, as a member of the Sunday School general board, and as a regional representative. Durham became a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy in April 1977. Shortly afterward, he became managing director of the LDS Church Historical Department over Church Historian Leonard J. Arrington. In October 1981, Durham became a member of the Presidency of the Seventy and remained in that position until his death. From 1982 to his death, Durham was the church's seventeenth Church Historian and Recorder. He was succeeded in that assignment by Dean L. Larson. Durham was a frequent contributor to the magazine Improvement Era and was the author or editor of a number of books, including compilations of the religious teachings of LDS church presidents John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, Heber J. Grant, and David O. McKay. Durham came from a musical family and he wrote the music to Gordon B. Hinckley's poem \\"My Redeemer Lives\\", which is now included as hymn number 135 in the LDS Church's current hymnal.\\"My Redeemer Lives\\", hymn no. 135, Hymns of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 1985). Durham and his wife were the parents of three children. In 1994, Arizona State University renamed their Language & Literature Building the G. Homer Durham Languages & Literature Building. Durham died in Salt Lake City. His personal and professional papers were donated to the University of Utah's J. Willard Marriott Library. Publications * G.

Biosand filters remove pathogens and suspended solids from water using biological and physical processes that take place in a sand column covered with a biofilm. BSFs have been shown to remove heavy metals, turbidity, bacteria, viruses and protozoa.Elliott, M., Stauber, C., Koksal, F., DiGiano, F., and M. Sobsey (2008). Reduction of E. coli, echovirus type 12 and bacteriophages in an intermittently operated 2 household-scale slow sand filter.Water Research, Volume 42, Issues 10-11 BSFs also reduce discoloration, odor and unpleasant taste. Studies have shown a correlation between use of BSFs and a decrease in the occurrence of diarrhea. Because of their effectiveness, ease of use, and lack of recurring costs, biosand filters are often considered appropriate technology in developing countries. It is estimated that over 200,000 BSFs are in use worldwide. History The household biosand filter was proposed by Dr. David Manz in the late 1980s at the University of Calgary, Canada. The system was developed from the slow sand filter, a technology that has been used for drinking water purification since the 1800s. Initial lab and field tests were conducted in 1991; the system was patented in 1993 and was implemented in the field in Nicaragua. The Canadian non-profit company Center for Affordable Water and Sanitation Technology (CAWST) was co-founded in 2001 by David Manz and Camille Dow Baker to promote education and training in water purification and sanitation including using this technology, and to continue developing it. A privately owned company, Hydraid Biosand Water Filter produces and distributes plans for filters. Biosand filter components Basic Diagram of a Concrete BioSand Filter Biosand filters are typically constructed from concrete or plastic. At the top of the filter, a tightly fitted lid prevents contamination and unwanted pests from entering the filter. Below this, the diffuser plate prevents disturbance of the biofilm when water is poured into the filter. Water then travels through the sand column, which removes pathogens and suspended solids. Below the sand column, a layer of gravel prevents sand from entering the drainage layer and clogging the outlet tube. Below the separating layer is the drainage layer consisting of coarser gravel that prevents clogging near the base of the outlet tube.  Filtration process  Pathogens and suspended solids are removed by biological and physical processes that take place in the biolayer and the sand layer. These processes include: *Mechanical trapping: Suspended solids and pathogens are trapped in the spaces between the sand grains. *Predation: Pathogens are consumed by microorganisms in the biolayer. *Adsorption: Pathogens are adsorbed into each other and to suspended solids in the water and sand grains. *Natural death: Pathogens finish their life cycles or die because there is not enough food or oxygen. =During the run= The high water level (hydraulic head) in the inlet reservoir zone pushes the water through the diffuser and filter, then decreases as water flows evenly through the sand. The flow rate slows because there is less pressure to force the water through the filter. The inlet water contains dissolved oxygen, nutrients, and contaminants. It provides the oxygen required by the microorganisms in the biofilm. Large suspended particles and pathogens are trapped in the top of the sand and partially plug the pore spaces between the sand grains. This causes the flow rate to decrease. =Pause period (idle time)= Idle time typically comprises greater than 80% of the daily cycle; during this time, microbial attenuation processes are likely to be significant. Most removal occurs where water is in contact with the biofilm. The processes that occur in the biofilm have not been identified. When the standing water layer reaches the level of the outlet tube, the flow stops. Ideally, this should be high enough to keep the biofilm in the sand layer wet and allow oxygen to diffuse through the standing water to the biolayer. The pause period allows microorganisms in the biolayer to consume the pathogens and nutrients in the water. The rate of flow through the filter is restored as they are consumed. If the pause period is too long, the biolayer will consume all of the pathogens and nutrients and will die, reducing the efficiency of the filter when it is used again. The pause period should be between 1 and 48 hours. Pathogens in the non-biological zone die from a lack of nutrients and oxygen. Maintenance Over time, particles accumulate between the filter's sand grains. As more water is poured, a biofilm forms along the top of the diffuser plate. Both of these occurrences cause a decrease in flow rate (clogging and bioclogging). Although slower flow rates generally improve water filtration due to idle time [APS1], it may become too slow for the users’ convenience. If flow rates fall below 0.1 litres/minute, it is recommended by CAWST to perform maintenance. The \\"swirl and dump\\", or wet harrowing cleaning technique, is used to restore flow rate. About is poured into the filter before cleaning (assuming the filter is empty). The upper layer of sand is then swirled in a circular motion. Dirty water from the swirling is dumped out and the sand is smoothed out at the top. This process is repeated until flow rate is restored. Cleaning the diffuser plate, outlet tube, lid, and outside surfaces of the filters regularly is also recommended. Long-term sustainability and efficacy of biosand filters depends on education and support from knowledgeable support personnel. Clean Water for Haiti, a non- profit in Haiti implements an education and follow-up program post- installation of the biosand filter. The program includes visits to the beneficiary homes after one, three and twelve months and another at 5 years from installation date. During each visit, beneficiaries receive repeated instruction about safe water practices and how to take care of the filter. Based on data collected since 2010, between 94% and 99% of filters are still being used regularly 12 months after installation. cleanwaterforhaiti.org Removal of contaminants =Turbidity= Results for turbidity reductions vary depending on the turbidity of the influent water. Turbid water contains sand, silt and clay. Feed turbidity in one study ranged from 1.86 to 3.9 NTU. In a study water was obtained from sample taps of water treatment plants from three local reservoirs. It poured through a slow sand filter and results showed that turbidity decreased to a mean of 1.45 NTU. In another study using surface water a 93% reduction in turbidity was observed. As the biofilm above the sand ripens, turbidity removal increases. Although biosand filters remove much turbidity, slow sand filters, which have a slower filtration rate, remove more. =Heavy metals= There is limited research on the removal of heavy metals by biosand filters. In a study conducted in South Africa, the filter removed about 64% of iron and 5% of magnesium.Mwabi, J.K., F.E. Adeyemo and T.O. Mamba. \\"Household Water Treatment Systems: A Solution to the Production of Safe Drinking.\\" SAO/NASA ADS: ADS Home Page. Web. 22 Dec. 2011. http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011PCE....36.1120M =Bacteria= In laboratory studies, the biosand filter has been found to remove about 98-99% of bacteria. In removal of Escherichia coli it was found that the biosand filter may increase due to biofilm formation over about two months. The removal after this time ranged from 97-99.99% depending on the daily water volume and percent primary effluent added. The addition of primary effluent or waste water facilitates growth of the biofilm which aids bacterial die-off. Research shows that biosand filters in use in the field remove fewer bacteria than ones in a controlled environment. In research conducted in 55 households of Bonao, Dominican Republic, the average E. coli reduction was about 93 percent. =Viruses= Lab tests have shown that while the filters reduce significant quantities of E. coli, they remove significantly fewer viruses because viruses are smaller. In a study using bacteriophages, virus removal ranged between 85% and 95% after 45 days of usage. A recent study has suggested that virus removal increases significantly over time, reaching 99.99% after approximately 150 days.Bradley, I., Straub, A., Maraccini, P., Markazi, Nguyen, T., (2011). Iron Oxide Amended Biosand Filters for Virus Removal. Water Research =Protozoa= In one lab test the biosand filter removed more than 99.9% of protozoa. In tests for one type of protozoa, Giardia lamblia, the filter removed 100% over 29 days of use. It removed 99.98% of the oocysts of another protozoa, Cryptosporidium sp., possibly due to their smaller size. This removal was comparable with that of the slow sand filter.  Health benefits  Studies in the Dominican Republic and Cambodia conducted by the University of North Carolina and the University of Nevada show that BSF use reduced the occurrence of diarrheal diseases by 47% in all age groups. In a study conducted by CAWST in Haiti, 95% of 187 households believed their water quality had improved since using biosand filters to clean it. 80% of users stated that their families’ health had improved since implementation. Such health perceptions on the use of biosand filter has shown to be more positive in long-term users. Types of biosand filters =Concrete= Concrete filters are the most widespread type of biosand filter. Concrete is generally preferable to other materials because of the low cost, wide availability and the ability to be constructed on-site. The plans for the concrete filter are distributed openly by CAWST. Several versions have been developed. The CAWST Version 9 biosand filter is constructed with a higher maximum loading rate. Although the filtered water passes EPA water quality standards, it is not optimal. Recent research establishes that contact time between the water and the granular material is the leading determinant in purifying water. The CAWST Version 10 biosand filter takes this into account; the volume of the water reservoir is equal to the pore space volume of the sand layer. The maximum loading rate was decreased by 33% to ensure stagnant water is in constant contact with granular material. Concrete BioSand filters are typically manufactured using steel molds. The plans for a steel mold are openly distributed by CAWST. Clean Water for Haiti, a non-profit organization based in Camp Marie, Haiti manufactures the biosand filters using an adaptation of the steel mold. http://cleanwaterforhaiti.org/programs/how-does-the-filter- work/ The non-profit organization OHorizons has designed a Wood Mold, based on CAWST’s Version 10 filter, which can function as low-cost alternative. The plans for a Wood Mold are openly available on the OHorizons website. =Plastic= Plastic filters are constructed from plastic barrels, usually formed offsite. Hydraid biosand filters are constructed from medical grade plastic with ultraviolet resistance. TivaWater is the newest version of the plastic biosand filter and has several important improvements.tivawater.com =Stainless steel= A stainless steel biosand filter developed by engineers at S M Sehgal Foundation, an NGO based in Gurugram (formerly Gurgaon), India, has been found to perform better than its concrete counterparts and with a wider opportunity for application and adoption in different geographical conditions. The high cost of plastic prevents its use in rural India. The stainless steel filter, called JalKalp, offers increased filtration rate and better portability (than concrete models) and better production quality control. Concrete filters are prone to breakage and can be difficult to transport due to weight (65 kg), make it unsuitable especially in remote rural or hilly locations. Common quality issues are variations in construction material and manufacturing flaws. Further, the efflorescence due to salts in water reduces the life of the concrete filter. The newly developed lightweight (4.5 kg) stainless steel biosand filter has an edge over concrete filters, overcoming each of those shortcomings and providing better quality control. Besides improving its appearance, stainless steel adds to the strength, reliability, durability, and portability of the filter. Water quality tests demonstrate JalKalp's effectiveness against E coli, total coliforms, turbidity, and iron contamination. This filter integrates the germicidal properties of copper with the conventional filtration. Introduction of copper foil in the drainage zone of JalKalp filter has increased the removal of total coliform and E coli to 100% from contaminated water. S M Sehgal Foundationhttp://www.smsfoundation.org/ promotes the model, which required no electricity, across India through partnerships with like-minded organizations to benefit as many rural families as possible.http://www.smsfoundation.org/wp- content/uploads/2016/02/Reinventing-the-biosand-filter.pdf There are challenges to creating biosand water filters in developing countries. Many lack the professional capability of constructing the metal forms to pour the concrete into. Finding proper mesh sizes to sift the sand layers may also be absent. In Nicaragua you may find metal workers capable of welding rebar for home construction, however, you will not find sheet metal bending equipment to create the metal molds. Sand is not sold in hardware stores like in the United States. It is most likely purchased by the pickup load from streambeds or pits and the only mesh available is 1/4 inch which is too large. When traveling to a third world country it might be best to take with you the proper mesh screens. Another problem facing the use of the filters is adoption. Many projects may provide assistance in building the water filters and some may even distribute them but getting the host country nationals to use the filters requires much more dedication. People need to be connected to water filter owners to insist they use the devices and get them into the habit of using them. Otherwise several of the filters are abandoned and left unattended in the roads. Simply handing the filters out is insufficient for adoption.

For warships 5 in/38 caliber dual purpose guns above bridge of destroyer , backfitted with postwar AN/SPG-25 radar antenna For warships of the 20th century, the director is part of the fire control system; it passes information to the computer that calculates range and elevation for the guns. Typically, positions on the ship measured range and bearing of the target; these instantaneous measurements are used to calculate rate of change values, and the computer (\\"fire control table\\" in Royal Navy terms) then predicts the correct firing solution, taking into account other parameters, such as wind direction, air temperature, and ballistic factors for the guns. In World War II a widely used computer in the US Navy was the electro-mechanical Mark I Fire Control Computer. On ships the director control towers for the main battery are placed high on the superstructure, where they have the best view. Due to their large size and weight, in the World War II era the computers were located in plotting rooms deep in the ship, below the armored deck on armored ships. Field artillery Directors were introduced into field artillery in the early 20th century to orient the guns of an artillery battery in their zero line (or 'centre of arc'). Directors were an essential element in the introduction of indirect artillery fire. In US service these directors were called 'aiming circles'. Directors could also be used instead of theodolites for artillery survey over shorter distances. The first directors used an open sight rotating on an angular scale (e.g. degrees & minutes, grads or mils of one sort or another), but by World War I most directors were optical instruments. Introduction of digital artillery sights in the 1990s removed the need for directors. Directors were mounted on a field tripod and oriented in relation to grid north of the map. If time was short this orientation usually used an integral compass, but was updated by calculation (azimuth by hour angle or azimuth by Polaris) or 'carried' by survey techniques from a survey control point. In the 1960s gyroscopic orientation was introduced. Anti-aircraft QF 3.7-inch anti-aircraft gun For anti-aircraft use, directors are usually used in conjunction with other fire control equipment, such as height finders or fire control radars. In some armies these 'directors' were called 'predictors'. The Mark 51 director was used by the US Navy for 40 mm guns and later for 3\\"/50 caliber guns.Mark 51 Article on the Mark 51 director at NavWeaps.com The Kerrison Predictor was also designed to be used with the Bofors 40 mm gun. Example The Bofors 40 mm gun (called a fire unit) used in its anti- aircraft role has the M5 director for its fire-control system., Brooks Directors and height finders The director is operated by a member of the range section who reports to the chief of section, who in turn reports to the platoon commander. The range section's leader is also called a range setter; he guides the preparation of the director and generator for firing, verifies the orientation and synchronisation of the gun and the director, and supervises fire control using the M5 director (or by the carriage when the M7 Weissight is used). The range section that uses the M5 director consists of the range setter, elevation tracker, azimuth tracker, power plant operator and telephone operator. The M5 director is used to determine or estimate the altitude or slant range of the aerial target. Two observers then track the aircraft through a pair of telescopes on opposite sides of the director. The trackers turn handwheels to keep the crosshairs of their respective telescope on the aircraft image. The rotation of the handwheels provides the director with data on the aircraft's change in elevation and change in azimuth in relation to the director. As the mechanisms inside the director respond to the rotation of the handwheels, a firing solution is mechanically calculated and continuously updated for as long as the target is tracked. Essentially, the director predicts future position based on the aircraft's present location and how it is moving. After their introduction, directors soon incorporated correction factors that could compensate for ballistic conditions such as air density, wind velocity and wind direction. If the director was not located near the gun sections, a correction for parallax error could also be entered to produce even more accurate firing direction calculations.p.23, Brown Directors transmit three important calculated firing solutions to the anti- aircraft gun firing crew: the correct firing azimuth and quadrant elevation calculated to determine where exactly to aim the gun, and for guns that use ammunition with timed fuzes, the director also provides the flight time for the projectile so the fuze can be set to detonate in close proximity to the target. Early anti-aircraft artillery batteries located the directors in the middle of the position, with the firing sections (guns) located at the corners of the position.p.172, Journal of the United States Artillery Before the introduction of radars, searchlights were used in conjunction with directors to allow night target engagement.p.352, Dow Boutwell, Brodinsky, Frederick, Pratt Harris, Nixon, Takudzwa Chaita, Robertson  U.S. Army anti-aircraft directors M2 director on T6 trailer M2 gun director 1932 * T1 (wilson) director * T4 gun director used with 3-inch M1918 gun * T6 was built by Sperry Corporation in 1930 and standardized as the M2 director. * M3 was standardized from the T8 in 1934 * M4 was standardized in 1939 * M5 Gun Director Mechanical, a US-produced Kerrison Predictor, for use with 37mm Gun M1 and M1 40 MM  M5A1  M5A2 * M7 gun director was standardized in 1941, and is similar to the M4 but added power control to the guns it is still described as a mechanical system. for use with 90 mm gun  M7A1B1  M7A1B2 * T10 standardized as M9 gun director electricalalso known as the BTL 10 predictor, p.170, Bennett for use with 90 mm gun produced by Bell Labs  M9B1 * M10 gun director electrical for use with 120 mm M1 gun Naval directors * Mark 1 * MK 51 Fire Control System * Mark 56 * Mark 57 * Mark 58 * Mark 59 *Mark 92 * Type 6 director (PRC) File:Sea Sparrow Mark115 Fire Control Director.JPEGA late Cold War era U.S. Navy Mark 115 Sea Sparrow fire control system director on board a .

Sessions III (born 1947 in Hartford, Connecticut) is serving as a Senior United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Vermont and has served as the Vice Chair and eventually as Chair of the United States Sentencing Commission. He was confirmed on October 21, 2009 as Chair of the United States Sentencing Commission, and served until December 22, 2010. Education and career Sessions was educated at Middlebury College where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1969. He earned a Juris Doctor in 1972 from the George Washington University Law School. Sessions served as a United States Army First Lieutenant. He was a law clerk for Judge Hilton Dier in Addison County District Court in 1973. He later worked for the Addison County Public Defender before entering private practice in 1978. He also worked as an adjunct professor at Vermont Law School from 1978 until 1995. In 1992 he managed the successful reelection campaign of Senator Patrick Leahy, who defeated Jim Douglas. Federal judicial service Sessions was nominated by Bill Clinton on June 30, 1995, to a seat vacated by Fred I. Parker. He was confirmed by the Senate on August 11, 1995, and received his commission on August 14, 1995. Sessions served as chief judge from 2002 to 2010. He assumed senior status on June 15, 2014. Notable case On September 12, 2007, Judge Sessions ruled in favor of the Sierra Club, the states of Vermont and New York, and other environmental groups in rejecting the auto industry’s attempt to block states from regulating emissions from cars. Sessions' ruling opens the doors for New York and Vermont to proceed with enacting the California Clean Car (Pavley) Standards, pending United States Environmental Protection Agency approval. These standards, adopted by California and at least 11 other states, aim to reduce emissions from cars by 30 percent when fully implemented in 2016.

Most of its species grow in tropical climates, but a few of them are native to temperate regions, and they are widespread in tropical Asia, Africa, Madagascar, Australia, New Zealand, North America, Central America, the Caribbean, and South America. The best-known species to gardeners in temperate areas are B. berteroana and B. miersii because of their frost tolerance. Seeds of B. bancroftii were used as a source of food by Australian Aborigines. Timbers of some species are very valuable. Overview Beilschmiedia miersii Taraire leaves and drupe Beilschmiedia is a genus of about 240-250 species, that are trees or shrubs; it has about 80 species in tropical Africa and Madagascar.http://database.prota.org/PROTAhtml/Beilschmiedia%20mannii_En.htm They are commonly canopy trees, growing at altitudes from near sea level to 2200 m. The trees grow in well-developed rainforests, and in warm or temperate forests on poorer sedimentary soils.http://www.florachilena.cl/Niv_tax/Angiospermas/Ordenes/Laurales/Lauraceae/Beilschmiedia/B.%20berteroana/Belloto%20del%20Sur.htm Most species grow in tropical climates, but a few of them are native to temperate regions. They are widespread in tropical Africa, Asia, Southeast Asia, Australia, New Zealand, Central America, the Caribbean, and South America. The timbers of some species is very valuable. Ecology Beilschmiedia falls within the Lauraceae, a family of aromatic evergreen trees or shrubs. Many botanical species are similar in foliage to the Lauraceae due to convergent evolution. Those plants are adapted to high rainfall and humidity. The patterns of speciation in the Lauraceae indicate, since the onset of aridification on the continents 15 million years ago (Mya), rainforest species diversified. One of the products of aridification is the isolation of populations and this likely caused the increase in the rate of speciation as found in the Lauraceae. This genus has species adapted to the laurel forest habitat, so common in the Lauraceae and species adapted to a more Mediterranean-type climate with a dry season with lower rainfall. The morphology of sclerophyllous species is divergent from other humid tropical climate species of the genus. The greatest diversity of species and a greater presence of the genus is given in cloud forest and tropical rainforest in Asia and Southeast Asia. In Madagascar, the genus Beilschmiedia is particularly important in the island flora, and their species were isolated when the island was separated from the African continent. The genus Beilschmiedia is present in a greater climatic distribution area than other genera of Lauraceae, Beilschmiedia species grow well in moist, well-drained ground, and tolerate a variety of soil types, and attain a maximum in tropical and wetter areas of distribution, but their pattern of speciation results in some cases from the product of aridification of the habitat. Some Beilschmiedia species are adapted to drier conditions than the typical Lauraceae. Some endangered relict species are living in temperate areas and are distributed in Mediterranean climate, and tropical and subtropical lowland forests and montane rainforest. Shade-loving B. mannii grows in riverine and swamp forest, or in evergreen primary and secondary forest. B. gaboonensis, B. lebrunii, and B. nitida are included in subgenus Hufelandia of Beilschmiedia. B. variabilis and B. zenkeri are included in section Acrothecon. Beilschmiedia gaboonensis is a medium- sized tree up to 30 m tall with a bole diameter up to 60 cm. It is distributed from Nigeria to DR Congo and occurs in wet and marshy locations in lowland rainforest. B. lebrunii is a rare tree up to 15 m tall with a bole diameter up to 30 cm, occurring in DR Congo in forest at 1450–1700 m altitude. B. nitida is a shrub or small tree up to 8 m tall, distributed in Cameroon and Congo. Beilschmiedia variabilis is a shrub or small tree up to 10 m tall with a bole diameter up to 25 cm, occurring rather commonly in Congo in the understorey of forest in swampy, periodically inundated or drier locations. B. zenkeri is a shrub or small tree up to 15 m tall, occurring in Cameroon and Congo in swampy and periodically inundated forest. The genus Beilschmiedia responded to favourable climatic periods and expanded across the available habitat, adapting also to more extreme conditions, but depending on favorable soil edaphic conditions. Beilschmiedia species need an annual oscillation of the temperature moderated by the proximity of the ocean and many species resist bad cold and frost. A related vegetal community evolved millions of years ago on the supercontinent of Gondwana, and species of this community are now found on several separate areas of the Southern Hemisphere, including South America, Africa, New Zealand, Australia, and New Caledonia. These lauroid-leaved plant communities are twofold to tropical climate and temperate climate, having the more temperate climate their origin in the named Antarctic flora. The genus Beilschmiedia is present in Mexico, Venezuela, southern Chile, and Argentina from the Pacific Ocean to the Andes between 38° and 45° latitude, where rainfall is abundant, from 1500 to 2500 mm according to locality, distributed throughout the year, but with some subhumid Mediterranean climate influence for three to fourr months in summer. The temperatures are unchanging enough and mild, with no month falling below 5 °C, and the warmest month below 22 °C. Also, they are present in the eastern end of Malesia, including New Guinea, that also has many additional elements of the Antarctic flora, including southern beech (Nothofagus) and eucalypts. The highlands of New Guinea and New Britain were linked to Australia around 40 Mya, the Indo-Australian tectonic plate began to split apart from the ancient supercontinent Gondwana. The laurifolia appears in Cape York Peninsula, mountains of the coastal strip of New South Wales in Australia, New Guinea, New Caledonia, Tasmania, and New Zealand. This laurel forests are home to species related to those in the Valdivian laurel forests, including southern beech (Nothofagus) through the connection of the Antarctic flora. Description Beilschmiedia tarairi Frequently, their bark is pale to dark brown, smooth or coarse, and they have fine, reddish-brown hairs densely covering the branchlets, and the young leaves are reddish. The dark green leaves are alternate and leathery. Sometimes broad, others small and narrow, the leaves have distinctive depressed veins. The flowers are greenish to cream to yellow-green, and pedicellate of 4–6 mm. The flowers often are clothed in dense reddish-brown hairs. The flowers are hermaphroditic and arranged in inflorescences. The inflorescence is an erect panicle arising from the leaf axil. The stamens are in two whorls; the ovary is in a superior position. The fruit is variable from one species to other' in some species it is a drupe, large and globose green, 12 cm in diameter with a tip at the apex. In other species, the fruit is an erect, plum-like, dark purple or sometimes elliptical to ovoid drupe, dark purple when ripe, and covered in a waxy bloom. In others, the fruit is a black, round drupe with a glaucous bloom, with a single seed inside. In the genus Beilschmiedia, the dispersal of seeds is by birds that swallow them, so they are shaped to attract the birds. The one-seeded fruits are an important food source for birds, including being a favorite food of the native pigeons in New Zealand. Species The type species is Beilschmiedia roxburghiana: with native range from the Himalayas to S. China, Indo-China to Peninsula Malaysia. Three Beilschmiedia species are endemic to New Zealand. Beilschmiedia tarairi (taraire) is a common canopy tree in the lowland forests of the North Island. The others are the common canopy tree tawa, (B. tawa), which has thin, willow-like leaves, and the tawaroa (B. tawaroa), which is similar to tawa, but has broader leaves. The New Zealand pigeon is the only species which can disperse the large seeds of the taraire, which pass through its gut unharmed. The Chilean Beilschmiedia miersii and Beilschmiedia berteroana are sclerophyllous endangered trees endemics to central Chile. The northern belloto (B. miersii) grows in coastal forest, while the southern belloto (B. berteroana) grows in submountain Andean zone of the temperate deciduous forest region of central Chile. Both forest associations are currently represented in the System of Wild Protected Areas by the government of Chile, they are endangered.

He worked at Bell Labs, TRW, and Bellcore (now Telcordia Technologies), researching optical fiber receiver design, propagation in multi-mode optical fibers, time-domain reflectometry, and the end-to-end modeling of fiber-optic communication systems. Biography Personick was born in Brooklyn in 1947 and attended the Bronx High School of Science. He graduated from the City College of New York with bachelor of electrical engineering degree in 1967 and joined Bell Laboratories. He obtained an SM degree in 1968 and Sc.D degree in 1970 from MIT with support from Bell Laboratories. His dissertation was on analog communication over quantum channels. At Bell Labs Personick conducted early research in fiber optics technology, including publication of papers on optical receiver design, applications of optical amplifiers, and propagation in multi-mode optical fibers with mode coupling. Some of his early analysis developed a model that included what became known as \\"the Personick integrals\\" as basic parameters for the capacity of optical systems. His research was used in early fiber-optic system field tests, including a 1976 experiment in Atlanta, Georgia, and the 1977 Chicago lightwave communication project, which demonstrated the technical and economic viability of optical fiber systems. In 1976 he invented the first practical optical time-domain reflectometer, a test instrument that became heavily used in the fiber optics industry. From 1978 through 1983, Personick was a manager at TRW Inc.. He managed organizations responsible for research and development of commercial telecommunications transmission and switching equipment, and organizations responsible for US federal government-funded research applications of optical communication technologies. In 1983 Personick joined Bell Communications Research (Bellcore). There, he managed organizations responsible for the creation of new telecommunications technologies. These included: fiber-to-the-home, asymmetric digital subscriber line, Integrated Services Digital Network, the Intelligent Network (customized call processing applications that depend upon customer-specific data stored in centralized “services control points”), wireless telecommunications networks, and packet-switched public telecommunications network services, including acting as the interface between the traditional telecommunications industry and the emerging Internet access industry. He managed systems engineering organizations, ranging in size from 150-400 and research organizations ranging in size from 100-150 persons. He helped shape telecommunications research policy through participation in national level committees such as the Federal Networking Council, and by influencing executives of the telecommunications industry. He initiated external government-funded research projects at Bellcore as an additional source of research funding. In 1993 he predicted social changes from the technology progress. Personick joined Drexel University's ECE department of electrical engineering and computer science on September 1, 1998, as the first E. Warren Colehower Chair Professor of Telecommunications, and as the first director of Drexel’s Center for Telecommunications and Information Networking. He acquired and managed more than $30 million in externally funded research contracts over 5 years. His research and teaching included calculating the channel capacity of optical fiber. and optical switching, an application of photonics. In 2003 Personick was appointed a member of the US Federal Communications Commission’s Technological Advisory Council. The council met approximately quarterly to discuss technology-related topics of interest to the FCC, in the context of airing issues and making recommendations to the FCC and the FCC’s Office of Engineering and Technology. The TAC’s last meeting was held in July 2006. Personick served on the board of directors for Optical Communications Products, Inc. from November 2000 through October 2007, when it was acquired by Oplink Communications. Personick joined New Jersey Institute of Technology's department of electrical and computer engineering on February 18, 2008, as the first Ying Wu Endowed Chair in Wireless Telecommunications until 2011. From September 1, 2011, to December 31, 2012, Personick was a senior university lecturer at NJIT. Honors Personick was elected a fellow of the Optical Society of America in 1988 in recognition of distinguished service in the advancement of optics. He received the John Tyndall Award, sponsored by the Optical Society of America (OSA) and the IEEE Lasers and Electro-Optics Society (LEOS), for career achievements and contributions to the field of optical fiber communications in April 2000. Personick became a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), in 1983 for contributions to the theory and application of optical fiber systems, and an IEEE Centennial Medal in 1984.

Throughout their career they released four studio albums, two extended plays, and a number of singles before breaking up in 1995. They were known for their dry sense of humor. History The precursor to Tar was a hardcore punk outfit called Blatant Dissent, which formed in DeKalb, Illinois where singer/guitarist John Mohr and drummer Mike Greenlees were attending Northern Illinois University. Joining Mohr and Greenlees in Tar were original bassist Tim Mescher (only until 1991 and who also played for Snailboy), bassist Tom Zaluckyj and guitarist Mark Zablocki. Zaluckyj and Mohr played unique instruments, crafted of aluminum, designed by Ian Schneller of Specimen Products. The band released albums on the Amphetamine Reptile and Touch and Go Records labels before disbanding in 1995. During its career, the band released a total of four singles, four albums, two mini albums, and contributed songs to six compilations and split singles. The band toured nationally and internationally with bands such as Jawbox, Arcwelder, and the Jesus Lizard. In 1994 the band made the decision to call it quits after releasing one final album. Over and Out was written and recorded over a period of a year and a half, produced by the band and engineered by Steve Albini and Bob Weston, and released in 1995. Tar reunited for a one-off performance at the PRF BBQ 2012 festival in Chicago, and later in the year, as opening act for Shellac at Lincoln hall in Chicago. In 2013, a double vinyl disc compilation titled 1988-1995 was released through Chunklet Magazine, limited to 150 gold colored copies that included download cards. The group would reunite again in 2017 to perform at the All Tomorrow's Impeachments festival.

The most recent Bishop was the Most Reverend John McAreavey who received his episcopal consecration in 1999.

It contains the city of Newry and the larger towns are Banbridge, Craigavon, Lurgan and Warrenpoint.Diocese of Dromore. Catholic Hierarchy. Retrieved on 23 August 2009. The bishop's seat (cathedra) is located at the Cathedral Church of St. Patrick and St. Colman in Newry. History =Foundation= The monastery of Dromore is believed to have been founded in the sixth century by St Colman (called also Mocholmóc), probably the first Abbot of Dromore.History. Diocese of Dromore. Retrieved 28 April 2010. The first building was a small wattle and daub church on the northern bank of the River Lagan. The Diocese of Dromore was established through the reorganisation of the Irish Church in the late 12th century, possibly at the synod held in Dublin in 1192 by the papal legate, Múirges Ua hÉnna, Archbishop of Cashel. The diocese coincided with the territory of the Uí Echach Cobo, which later became the baronies of Upper and Lower Iveagh, and the lordship of Newry, County Down. =Post-Reformation= During the 16th century Reformation, the Roman Catholic Church lost control of the old cathedral in Dormer to the Protestant Church of Ireland, which was wholly destroyed during the rebellion of 1641 and rebuilt twenty years later. In the 19th century, the Church chose the site of a new cathedral at Newry, the largest town of County Down, and a place of significant ecclesiastical importance as the site of an ancient monastery, situated at the head of Carlingford Lough. Work for building of Newry Cathedral begun in 1823 and was completed in 1829 by Dr. Michael Blake (bishop of Dromore 1833–1860) who had been Vicar-General of Dublin and the restorer of the Irish College at Rome. This cathedral was enlarged and beautified by Bishop Henry O'Neill, who succeeded Bishop Thomas MacGivern in 1901. Under Dr. McGivern's predecessor, Dr. John Pius Leahy, O.P. (1860–1890), a Dominican priory was founded on the Armagh side of Newry, and a church erected. The Poor Clares, who went to Newry from Harold's Cross, Dublin, in 1830, were for many years the only nuns north of the River Boyne. The Sisters of Mercy founded a convent at Newry in 1855. Abbey Yard in Newry marks the site of the Cistercian abbey founded in 1144 by St. Bernard's friend, St. Malachy O'Morgair, and endowed in 1157 by Maurice O'Loughlin, High King of Ireland. It is called in the annals Monasterium de Viridi Ligno — a name given to Newry from the yew-tree, said to have been planted there by St. Patrick, the Irish name being Niubar (and sometimes Newrkintragh, \\"the yew at the head of the strand\\") which is Latinized Ivorium or Nevoracum, but more commonly as above Viride Lignum. Allegations of Sexual Abuse In 2012 the Parish Priest of Donaghmore in the diocese, Fr Terence Rafferty, was convicted of four counts of indecently assaulting a young girl in 2001. Five other offences were left on the books. The offences had been reported to the diocese in 2011: the diocese suspended him and promptly informed the relevant authorities. On 1 March 2018 Bishop John McAreavey resigned as Bishop of Dromore with immediate effect amid controversy concerning his knowledge of, and behaviour towards Fr. Malachy Finegan. McAreavey celebrated Mass him alongside in 2000 despite knowing Finegan to be a paedophile against whom very serious criminal allegations had been made. Indeed, in 2002, John McAreavey celebrated the funeral Mass of Malachy Finegan in Warrenpoint, Co. Down, Northern Ireland. The Vatican's formal acceptance of McAreavey's resignation was announced on 26 March 2018 and Bishop Philip Boyce was appointed Apostolic Administrator. On Monday 15 April 2019, Pope Francis appointed the Archbishop of Armagh - Eamon Martin as Apostolic Administrator of the diocese with \\"immediate effect\\". In response to the appointment, the outgoing apostolic administrator Bishop Boyce said \\"I am very happy to welcome Archbishop Eamon Martin as the new Apostolic Administrator of Dromore. I wish to thank the people and clergy for their prayers, goodwill, encouragement and unstinting support over the last year. While I am looking forward to my retirement, I remain available to pastorally support Archbishop Martin, and Dromore, in any way that I can\\". Archbishop Eamon Martin said, “The Holy Father has asked me to take over the role of Apostolic Administrator from Bishop Boyce whilst continuing with my role as Archbishop of Armagh.

Microtityus and Microbuthus barely reach 2 cm (0.8 in). The largest members are found among Androctonus (fattail scorpions), Apistobuthus, and Centruroides; and can reach 12 cm (about 5 in). Most of them have between two and five pairs of eyes. Some resemble the Vaejovidae. The Chaerilidae and Chactidae have one pair of eyes at most, and the former show a yellowish spot between and to the rear of these. Their vernacular name refers to the thick tails found in many Buthidae, especially in the Old World. The pedipalps, though, tend to be weak, slender, and tweezer-like. The Buthidae are generally rather cryptically colored, quite uniformly ochre to brown, but some are black or (like Centruroides and Uroplectes) more vividly colored. More conspicuous patterns and shapes occur, e.g., in Isometrus or Lychas. Toxicity and relationship with humans A handful of sometimes species-rich genera – fattail scorpions (Androctonus), Centruroides, Hottentotta, Leiurus, Parabuthus, and Tityus – are notorious for their strong venom. Human fatalities have been recorded from fewer than two dozen species; identification of a particular Tityus is likely problematic and detailed data on the venom exists only for a small fraction of the Buthidae (see BmKAEP from the venom of Mesobuthus martensii, for example). Mechanism of toxicity Studied Buthidae toxins have been found to hyperpolarize nerves and slow inactivation, causing painful nerve firing that can last for hours. Many toxins trigger Na+ channels to open prematurely, causing excess sodium ion leakage that triggers nerve signal transduction. Rowe,A.H., Xiao, Y., Scales, J., Linse, K.D., Rowe, M.P., Cummins, T.R., Zakon, H.H. (2011): Isolation and Characterization of CvIV4: A Pain Inducing α- Scorpion Toxin - . Retrieved June July 20, 2020. Other toxins have been found to bind K+ leak channels to prevent the flow of potassium ions, disallowing the hyperpolarized nerve membrane from depolarizing and returning to its resting state. The Na+ channel toxins of both Old World and New World Buthids (from Africa/Asia and the Americas, respectively) have a similar protein homology and mechanism of action. It is speculated that toxins from these two groups are derived from the evolutionary ancestor before divergence 150 million years ago.

Biography Chandrakant T. Patel was born in Sarsa in the Kaira District of Gujarat and obtained his MSc degree in Plant Breeding and Genetics from Bombay University in 1954. He is known as Father of Hybrid cotton. He worked at Surat Agricultural University and after two decades of continuous research efforts, successfully developed an intraspecific hybrid by crossing Gujarat-67 X American Nectariless variety, known as Hybrid-4 (H-4), which produced about 80 to 100 qt of Kapas/ha. Earlier research practices.carried out for nearly two decades helped to procure 213–304 kg.lint/ha. But the Hybrid-4 variety produced a record high of 6,918 kg kapas/ha (i.e.:2,352 kg lint/h] H-4 became highly successful in Central India, giving more than twice the yield compared to the parent varieties Gujarath-67. The fibre properties were excellent and its adaptability makes it still popular. This was the first successful hybrid of commercially cultivated cotton and was a turning point in the Indian Cotton Development programme. He devised many innovative methods in plant breeding, the most popular being the nursery-cum-pot irrigation and telephone system, for successful cotton cultivation. The Sardar Patel University in Vallabh Vidyanagar, Gujarat, bestowed an honorary D.Sc. degree on him in 1978. Patel died in 1990 as result of a car accident.

He is associated with the region surrounding Cartagena, of which he is co-patron. A hermitage was founded adjacent to the Mar Menor, and ruins of a monastery bearing his name date from before the Moorish conquest of 711 AD, that is, from the Visigothic era. Historicity and legends Pre-Christian or Muslim origins for the cult of Saint Ginés have been suggested, including identification with the cult of a Roman genius or with an Islamic jinn; as well as with an ancient Carthaginian site dedicated to the god Ba'al. The subsequent association of the site with Christian hermits and anchorites is indisputable. However, there is no actual tomb or sepulchre for Ginés: the location of his relics was a cause for the invention of multiple legends. Some scholars believe the saint may be identical with Saint Genesius of Arles, in Spanish known as San Ginés de Arlés, who was martyred in the 4th century. His feast day is identical to that of Genesius of Arles, a connection that some scholars consider as proof that they are identical. According to Serafino Prete, the spread and popularity of Genesius’ cult in other cities of Gaul and beyond gave rise to the multiplication and “localization” of his cult, so that the saints Genesius of Alvernia, Genesius of Béziers, Genesius of Rome, Genesius of Cordoba and Ginés de la Jara are actually variations on the same saint and saint’s cult. A legend that appears in a manuscript dating from 1243, Liber Sancti Iacobi, states that the martyr of Arles was buried at Arles but that his head was transported miraculously \\"in the hands of angels\\" to Cartagena. This may represent an attempt to explain the existence of the cult of the same saint in two separate locations. An additional variation on the legend states that after Ginés was decapitated in southern France, he picked up his head and threw it into the Rhône. The head was carried by sea to the coast of Murcia, where it was venerated as a relic. No definite dates regarding his birth and death exist. However, a vigorous set of legends surrounding him arose. He is believed to have sailed from France around 800 AD and to have been shipwrecked on the Murcian coast, where he established a monastery. Another legend made him a kinsman of Roland. Ginés refused any claim to the throne of France. After his death, the coffin bearing his remains were brought to France. However, they were miraculously empty when they arrived there; the relics remained near the Mar Menor. Additional stories state that he went on a pilgrimage to Compostela, having various adventures on the way. On the hill known as Cabezo del Miral, he remained until his death. His fame grew and his sepulcher became a place of pilgrimage. Miracles multiplied there. Veneration The spot of Ginés' supposed hermitage at the Mar Menor survived as a sacred site during the age of Muslim rule (and was mentioned by Moorish authors). After the area’s conquest by the Castilians, Alfonso X of Castile restored the bishopric and founded the monastery of San Ginés de la Jara (1250). The site of his monastery was officially declared a holy place and place of pilgrimage by Alfonso X. It was a Dominican monastery before passing to the Franciscans. The monastery, re-founded in 1491 and rebuilt in the 16th century, is the center of the cult of this saint. It is considered the resting place of his relics. His cult has been described as essentially local, though it spread to nearby areas, such as Lorca, Murcia, Orihuela, and even North Africa. Ginés inspired great devotion, and he was considered by local vintners their patron. He was considered the protector of agricultural laborers and of the fields. Sailors also invoked his aid against storms. He was also invoked against illnesses and conditions such as hernias in children. In 1541, Pope Paul III officially canonized him. His feast day is August 25. Around 1692, La Roldana made a polychromed sculpture of Ginés de la Jara (now at the Getty Center).

Retrieved on 16 January 2009.

The main towns are Bailieborough, Ballyjamesduff, Cavan, Manorhamilton and Virginia. Ecclesiastical history The diocese of Kilmore was originally called Breifne (Latin: Tirbrunensis, Tybruinensis or Triburnia; Irish: Tír mBriúin, meaning \\"the land of the descendants of Brian\\", one of the Uí Briúin kings of Connacht)., Handbook of British Chronology, p. 362. It was formally established as one of the dioceses approved by Cardinal Giovanni Paparoni at the synod of Kells in 1152. The boundaries of the diocese are approximately the same as those of the ancient Kingdom of Breifne; which today consists of almost all of County Cavan, roughly the northern half of County Leitrim, and parts of County Fermanagh, County Meath and County Sligo. In 1454, Bishop Aindrias Mac Brádaigh (Andrew McBrady) was given permission by Pope Nicholas V to have the ancient church at Kilmore, founded in the sixth century by Saint Felim, to be the cathedral church of the diocese. It was rebuilt and became known in Irish as An Chill Mhór (meaning Great Church) and anglicised as Kilmore, which gave its name to the diocese, a name which has remained ever since. Tir Brun / Kilmore was a territorial diocese, based on the kingdom of Breifne. From the late twelfth century the chieftainship of Breifne was contested between the Ui Raghallaigh or O'Reilly sept in the east and the Ui Ruairc or O'Rourke sept in the west. The bishops of the diocese came predominantly from the eastern end of the diocese, right down until the reformation. Kingdom of Ireland During the Reformation in Ireland, the diocese lost the cathedral and all other temporalities. After a period of two hundred years of uncertainty, Bishop Denis Maguire (1770–98) gave new stability to the diocese and started the process of rebuilding both discipline and churches. Bishop James Browne (1827–65) continued with this work and founded the diocesan college in 1839. Patrick Lyons (bishop of Kilmore) (1937–49) had the old Roman Catholic Cathedral in Cavan rebuilt between 1938 and 1942. The current cathedral is dedicated to Saints Patrick and Felim and is built in the neoclassical style with a spire of .Cathedral of Saints Patrick and Felim, Cavan. Retrieved on 16 January 2009.

The character made her first screen appearance on 17 January 1988, which was the show's pilot episode. She departed in 1989, when she was written out of the series along with Frank Lloyd who played her on-screen husband Neville McPhee. However she has made sporadic returns first in 2000, for Sally Fletcher's (Kate Ritchie) wedding storyline and again in 2002, 2004 and 2008, for various story arcs. Casting When actress Sheila Kennelly secured the role of Floss in Home and Away she was also due to film a small role in the 1988 film Evil Angels. The schedule clashed with the first week of filming on Home and Away and Kennelly decided to pull out of the role in Evil Angels.Oram 1989, p.115. At the time she owned a farm and would have to leave her farm before 5 AM to arrive on-set in good time, despite sometimes being up all night tending to her livestock.Oram 1989, p.118. Development =Characterisation= Floss is characterised as a \\"naturally gregarious\\" woman. Floss is kind and \\"would open her purse for anyone\\" in need.J Clayden 1989, p.32. Profiling the character in the book Home and Away – Official Collector’s Edition, Andrea Black wrote \\"a carnival worker, Floss was Summer Bay's resident psycic.\\" Writers created an on-screen partnership between Floss and her husband Neville McPhee (Frank Lloyd). Together they play the part of retired residents of Summer Bay's caravan park and continue their thirty-five year marriage. They have been described by the show's publicity team as \\"thoroughly devoted, although constantly bickering.\\" Neville is more \\"stingy\\" in comparison to the kind Floss. This leads the pair to have quarrels but their love for each other ensures they always make up quickly. In the official \\"Home and Away Annual\\", author Kesta Desmond wrote that the source of Floss and Neville's constant bickering was money problems, but noted that a long marriage proved their love for each other.Desmond 1990, p.11. In their backstory Floss and Neville once toured the carnival circuit. The show's producers told author James Oram that \\"to people who don't know them, it seems as if they are always bickering, but they both thoroughly enjoy their arguments. In their own way, they are devoted to one another.\\"Oram 1989, p.117. Lloyd enjoyed working with Kennelly on creating the partnership between their characters. He told Oram that Kennelly is \\"an absolutely marvelous lady and a superb actress. We hit it off right from the word go and had some wonderful times.\\"Oram 1989, p.120. Kennelly became concerned that the characters of Floss and Neville were not being developed by the show's production team. She noted that writers never explored Floss' life in the carnival and instead chose to focus more on the younger characters. Ten months into working on the show, Kennelly and Lloyd were told that their contracts would not be renewed. Their exit story saw Floss and Neville deciding to move to another caravan park in another town.Oram 1989, p.119. =Returns= The actress reprised the role in 2002, alongside various past cast members to celebrate summer bay's fictional \\"150 year anniversary\\". When she returns Floss reveals that she has continued to do tarot readings, following Neville's off-screen death. Unlike other returnees, Floss plays a centric part in the show's boat disaster storyline. To celebrate the town's birthday a boat trip is arranged and all local residents are invited. Kate Ritchie who plays Sally Fletcher told a reporter from Inside Soap that not everyone can board the ship and those left behind are soon thankful as the ship sinks. Prior to the disaster Floss predicts that something bad will happen to the town via her tarot readings. Ritchie added that \\"Floss has been fortune-telling, but no one pays any attention to her, but then the surf club partygoers find out that the boat has gone down with everyone on board!\\" Kennelly returned to the series in 2004. Her reintroduction features her arriving in Summer Bay with the Carny theatre travelling circus. Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) is not happy when the circus sets up in Summer Bay without a permit. He confronts them and is shocked to find Floss leading the company. Jade Sutherland (Kate Garven) later finds Floss cowering in pain but Floss asks her to keep in a secret. But it becomes apparent she is suffering from a serious illness. Storylines Floss, along with her husband Neville, first appears in the Caravan Park when the Fletcher family arrive. Floss travels to the city meets her grandson Ben (Justin Rosniak) after lying to his nanny about her references and uses a false name \\"Mrs Neville\\". Ben, not knowing who Floss is rude to her at first but eventually softens towards her and she takes him to Summer Bay to meet his grandfather. When Ben discovers pictures of his father Scott (Peter Ford) in a photo album belonging to Floss and Neville, he wants to know the truth. Floss tells him and he reveals that Scott told them they were dead. Scott later turns up in Summer Bay and retrieves Ben much to the displeasure of him and his parents. Floss and Neville follow them back to the city and camp out on the front lawn until Scott agrees to let them see Ben. The police arrive and investigate a complaint made by Ben against Scott saying that he had hit him. After everything is cleared up, Scott orders Floss and Neville to leave but they don't want to. Ben threatens to run away when his grandparents are banished, so they lie to him, telling him they don't want to see him again. When Mother's Day approaches, Scott agrees to visit Floss and brings his wife Anna (Kate Turner), and Ben with him and the McPhees spend the day playing cricket on the beach. Floss becomes obsessed after a Tarot reading reveals Bobby Simpson (Nicolle Dickson) will cause the death of one of the Fletchers and remembers the license plate when she begins dreaming of Frank Morgan's (Alex Papps) death in a car accident. Bobby destroys Frank's car after hearing this but the McPhees give Tom Fletcher (Roger Oakley), an anonymous cheque and he buys Frank a new car with an almost identical license plate. Frank has an accident on the day of his wedding while swerving to avoid Bobby but survives. In early 1989, Floss and Neville decide to leave the bay and join their old circus. They sneak away, not wanting a big fuss but their car breaks down and The Fletchers catch them just in time to say a proper goodbye. Just over a decade later, Floss returns to the bay for Sally's ill- fated wedding to Kieran Fletcher (Spencer McLaren). She tells Sally that Neville died four years previous but lived a good life (the actor Frank Lloyd had died in 1995). In 2002, Summer Bay celebrates its 150th anniversary and Floss predicts the Mirgini disaster after warning Shelley Sutherland (Paula Forrest) against wearing red. Shelly and her daughter, Kirsty (Christie Hayes) are lost at sea for several days. When they are eventually rescued, Floss leaves. Floss returns in 2004 with the travelling circus and reveals to Sally that she is dying of cancer and wants her and her husband Flynn Saunders (Joel McIlroy) to help euthanize her. However, Floss receives news that she is not dying after all. Four years later on the eve of Sally's departure, Floss has a vision of Aden Jefferies (Todd Lasance) in trouble. Aden is found in the crumbling wreck of the collapsing Beachside Diner and safely rushed to hospital. Floss later attends Sally's tribute night at the school before setting off again. Reception Kennelly received a fan letter from a viewer in Queensland who had read she lived on a farm in the Hunter Region. The letter arrived in less than a week. Floss and her husband Neville were described by Lucy Clark of the Sun-Herald as \\"A Funny Old Pair\\".

Pettersen (vocals) and Kim-Erling Johansen (drums) after the three members quit the hardcore outfit Profound. The group's web site states that their name was inspired by Ron Miksha, a beekeeper who developed chemical warfare techniques for the US Army during the Vietnam War, according to the band. This claim is rejected by Ron Miksha.Miksha.nethttp://www.badbeekeeping.com/bandet.htm After moving to Trondheim in 2002, band member Mathis Ståle Mathisen (second guitar and vocals) joined the group. By 2003, their video Half the Battle was played extensively in Europe to critical acclaim. Miksha followed with Collect Your Hazardous Waste in 2005 and touring in London and Scandinavia. Miksha cites musical influences of Pantera, Machine Head, Björk, Rammstein, Skinlab, Sepultura, Rage Against the Machine Slipknot, Strapping Young Lad, Static x, Fear Factory, Faith No More, Mr. Bungle, Slayer, Jaga Jazzist, Amen, atThedriveIn, SOAD, and Nine Inch Nails. RockSomething's reviewer described Collect Your Hazardous Waste as, \\"a mightily brutal, yet startlingly intelligent sound\\" and compared Miksha to American Head Charge.

One of the most endangered species of North American trees, it is endemic to Smyth County, in the U.S. state of Virginia. It is part of the temperate broadleaf and mixed forests biome. 250px The tree was first described in 1914 as a variety of Betula lenta,Davis, E. Five-year Review: Virginia Roundleaf Birch. USFWS. September 2006. and elevated to species status in 1945.Flora of North America It hybridizes with B. lenta and it has been suggested that it is actually a round-leaved mutant form of B. lenta. Some authorities prefer to treat it as a variety. After it was first discovered in 1914, the tree was not seen again and was thought to be extinct until 1975, when some individuals were found. These 18 adult trees and 23 saplings and seedlings were in a forest along the degraded banks of Cressy Creek on Smyth County, Virginia. The tree was federally listed as an endangered species and conservation efforts were begun. Many seedlings were sprouted in greenhouses and planted in the forest. By 1995 there were 20 populations and it was downlisted to threatened status. The tree was propagated in order to discourage collectors from taking wild specimens, or vandals from destroying them. A recent count estimated 961 individuals in the wild as of 2006. Eight of these are in the original creekside population.The Nature Conservancy The species will not be removed from the endangered species list yet because it has not been observed reproducing sexually, and naturally, more than once. The expansion of its range is limited because the area is surrounded by agricultural land, but the territory on which the tree occurs is not immediately threatened. This is a tree of moderate size, growing up to 15 meters tall. The crown is compact. The bark is aromatic and dark brown or black in color.Sharik, T.Betula uber Revised Recovery Plan. USFWS. 1985. The leaf is round or slightly oval with a heart-shaped base and a toothed edge and measures up to 5 centimeters long. The catkin is up to 2.8 centimeters long and contains tiny samaras measuring 2 millimeters in length. The tree is wind- pollinated and reproduces by seed. Seed production is much heavier in some years than in others. The tree's lifespan is around 50 years. References External links * World Conservation Monitoring Centre 1998.

McCorley was born in Belfast. His family had a very strong republican tradition and he claimed to be the great-grandson of the United Irishmen folk hero Roddy McCorley, who was executed for his part in the 1798 rebellion. Joins the IRA McCorley was a member of the Belfast Brigade of the Irish Republican Army during the Irish War of Independence, 1919–1922. He was commandant of the Brigade's first battalion. In June 1920, he was involved in an attack on a Royal Irish Constabulary Police barracks at Crossgar, county Down. On Sunday August 22, 1920 in Lisburn, McCorley was involved in the assassination of DI Oswald Swanzy, Royal Irish Constabulary who was held responsible by Michael Collins for the assassination of Tomas McCurtain, Lord Mayor of Cork. McCorley was noted for his militancy, as he was in favour of armed attacks on British forces in Belfast. The Brigade's leaders, by contrast, in particular, Joe McKelvey, were wary of sanctioning attacks for fear of loyalist reprisals on republicans and the Catholic population in general. In addition, McCorley was in favour of conducting an armed defence of Catholic areas, whereas McKelvey did not want the IRA to get involved in what he considered to be sectarian violence. McCorley wrote later that in the end, 'the issue settled itself within a very short space of time, when the Orange mob was given uniforms, paid for by the British, and called the Ulster Special Constabulary'. The role of the USC, a temporary police force raised for counter-insurgency purposes, in the conflict is still debated, but republicans maintain that the organisation was responsible for the indiscriminate killings of Catholics and nationalists. The Active Service Unit On 26 January 1921, McCorley, was involved in the fatal shooting of three Auxiliary Division officers in their beds in the Railway View hotel in central Belfast. Shortly afterwards, McCorley and another IRA man, Seamus Woods, organised an Active Service Unit within the first battalion of the Belfast Brigade, with the intention of carrying out attacks, with or without the approval of the Brigade leadership. The unit consisted of 32 men. McCorley later wrote, 'I issued a general order that, where reprisal gangs [State forces] were cornered, no prisoners were to be taken'. In March 1921, McCorley personally led the ASU in the killing of three Black and Tans in Victoria street in central Belfast. He was responsible for the deaths of two more Auxiliaries in Donegall Place in April. In reprisal for these shootings, members of the Royal Irish Constabulary assassinated two republican activists, the Duffin brothers in Clonard Gardens in west Belfast. Thereafter, there was what historian Robert Lynch has described as a, 'savage underground war' between McCorley's ASU and RIC personnel based in Springfield Road barracks and led by an Inspector Ferris. Ferris himself was among the casualties, being shot in the chest and neck, but surviving. In addition, McCorley's men bombed and burned a number of businesses including several cinemas and a Reform Club. In May 1921, however, 13 of McCorley's best men were arrested when surrounded by British troops during an operation in county Cavan. They were held in Crumlin Road jail and sentenced to death. On 3 June, McCorley organised an attack on Crumlin Road jail in an attempt to rescue the IRA men held there before they were executed. The operation was not a success, however the condemned men were reprieved after a truce was agreed between the IRA and British forces in July 1921. Belfast Brigade leader In April 1922, McCorley became leader of the IRA Belfast Brigade after Joe McKelvey went south to Dublin to join other IRA members who were against the Anglo-Irish Treaty. McCorley for his part, supported the Treaty, despite the fact that it provided for the partition of Ireland and the continued British rule in Northern Ireland. The reason for this was that Michael Collins and Eoin O'Duffy had assured him that this was only a tactical move and indeed, Collins sent men, money and weapons to the IRA in the North throughout 1922. However, McCorley's command saw the collapse of the Belfast IRA. In May 1922, the IRA launched an offensive with attacks all across Northern Ireland. In Belfast, McCorley carried out an assault on Musgrave Street RIC barracks. He also conducted an arson campaign on businesses in Belfast. His men also carried out a number of assassinations, including that of Unionist MP William Twaddell, which caused the internment of over 200 Belfast IRA men. Civil War To escape from the subsequent repression, McCorley and over 900 Northern IRA men fled south, to the Irish Free State, where they were housed in the Curragh. McCorley was put in command of these men. In June 1922, the Irish Civil War broke out between Pro and Anti-Treaty elements of the IRA. McCorley took the side of the Free State and Michael Collins. After Michael Collins was killed in August 1922, McCorley's men were stood down. About 300 of them joined the National Army and were sent to County Kerry to put down anti-Treaty guerrillas there. In the Spring of 1923, McCorley, bitterly disillusioned by the brutal counter-insurgency against fellow republicans, resigned his command. He recalled he was, 'fed up', with the civil war. He later asserted that he 'hated the Treaty' and only supported it because it allowed Ireland to have its own armed forces. In 1936 he was instrumental in the establishment of the All-Ireland Old IRA Men's Organisation, serving as Vice-President with President Liam Deasy (Cork No. 3 Brigade) and Secretary George Lennon (Waterford No. 2 Brigade). Coras na Poblachta In the 1940s, McCorley was a founding member of Córas na Poblachta, a political party which aspired to a United Ireland and economic independence from Britain.

He was the first director of the Technological Laboratory created by the Indian Central Cotton Committee (ICCC) in Bombay in 1924. He was awarded the Warner Memorial Medal by the Textile Institute in 1931 in recognition of outstanding work in textile science and technology and was appointed to the CBE in 1950. My Spin Lab,H.R.Laxmivenkatesh(2005) Education and career Turner was a scholar of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, and of the University of London, where he obtained a first class Bachelor degree, whose first research was done under Sir William Pope. In 1912, he joined the staff of the National Physical Laboratory, London, to pursue research on aircraft and airship materials and was appointed Head of the Fabrics Research Section of the Royal Aircraft Factory. Immediately after World War I, the Manchester College of Technology offered him the newly established chair of textile technology, which he held until 1923. At ICCC, Bombay Turner went to India, by the end of 1923, to become director of research for the Indian Central Cotton Committee (ICCC), to train the Indian staff members and to organise a comprehensive research programme at the newly started Technological Laboratory in Bombay (now the Central Institute for Research on Cotton Technology (CIRCOT)), which was opened by the then Viceroy and Governor-General of India, by His Excellency The Rt. Hon.Rufus Isaacs, the Earl of Reading, P.C; G.C.B; GMSI; GMIE; GCVO; on 3rd, December 1924. Turner worked on several new projects studying Indian cottons, including the American hirsutum cottons that were being tried by the officers of the East India Cotton Association. He streamlined the entire cotton research programmes, co-ordinated the scientists and the Bombay cotton mills, who were the ultimate users of the cotton crop. The best varieties of cotton once recognised, were to be exported to the United Kingdom. The Research papers entitled, \\"The Foundation of yarn strength\\", was culminated in many parts, is the best documented series of articles, compiled and edited by him. This work, has been published in The Journal of Textile Institute. He was responsible for many of the technological reports, that flowed from the laboratory and published in the Shirley Institute Memoirs by the Shirley Institute, Didsbury, Manchester. While he was in India, he was ably assisted by R. P. Richardson, the spinning master. After working for six years in India, he was appointed as the head of the Spinning Department at the Shirley Institute, Manchester, and as head of the British Cotton Industries Research Association BCIRA in 1931. He was offered the post of director of research at the Linen Industry Research Association, Lambeg, Lisburn, in Northern Ireland in 1940 and spent his last 16 years of service there, raising its profile to become accepted as the research centre of the whole linen industry and trade. He retired in March 1956, aged 67. Technological Laboratory The Laboratory grew in leaps and bounds. After 1966 The Administration was taken over by ICAR, New Delhi, and the name of Laboratory was changed to Cotton Technological Research Laboratory, (CTRL) and further changed to 'The Central Institute for Research on Cotton Technology.'

Additionally, a much smaller number of Bolivian Americans may have Japanese or Afro-Bolivian heritage. Bolivians compose the third smallest Hispanic group in the United States, with a 2010 Census population of 99,210. The highest concentration resides in the Washington Metropolitan Area, which accounts for 38% of the total Bolivian population in the US. Additional areas of concentration include the New York City borough of Queens, Miami-Dade County, and the cities of Los Angeles and Providence, Rhode Island.  History  Westlake Theatre building, side wall mural of Jaime Escalante and Edward James Olmos. Bolivian immigration into the United States occurred in two significant phases. The first phase occurred during and subsequent to the 1952 National Revolution (between 1952 and the latter 1960s). Most of these immigrants consisted of middle- to upper-middle income occupational professionals or political dissidents, and identify with Bolivia's White or Criollo (descendants from Europeans born in Bolivia) society. The second notable phase of Bolivian immigration (between 1980 and 1988) was a result of Bolivia's fiscal policies in the 1970s which gave way to the hyperinflation throughout most of the 1980s. Most of these immigrants consisted of lower-income Mestizo (European/Amerindian mix) and Indigenous Bolivians obtaining work posts as service and manual laborers. Many Bolivians who emigrated to the United States came as tourists. However, many remained indefinitely in the country, setting with family and friends. This made it difficult to know the number of Bolivians living in the United States. Between 1984 and 1993, only 4,574 Bolivians got U.S. citizenship. In this period about 457 were naturalized each year.Bolivian Americans by Tim Eigo  Demographics  Raquel Welch American actress and singer. Bolivian American Creatives: Fernanda Alcocer, Charlene Eckels, Stephen Leon Vanessa Acosta, Rodrigo Bellot Bolivians have settled throughout the United States, mainly in Washington D.C., California and Maryland; there are also large groups of Bolivian immigrants in Texas, New York City, New Jersey, South Florida, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Chicago. The number of Bolivians in the U.S. in 2006 was estimated at 82,322.
