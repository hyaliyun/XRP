It has smooth bark, narrow lance-shaped to curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of between nine and thirteen, creamy white flowers and hemispherical fruit. Description Eucalyptus salmonophloia is a tree that typically grows to a height of but does not form a lignotuber. It has smooth pale grey bark that is shed in flakes to reveal salmon-coloured new bark in summer. Young plants have dull green, egg-shaped to broadly lance- shaped leaves that are long and wide and petiolate. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, the same shade of glossy green on both sides, narrow lance-shaped to curved, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of between nine and thirteen on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval to spherical, long and wide. Flowering occurs from August to December and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody, hemispherical capsule long and wide with the valves protruding but fragile. The capsules usually remain in place until the following summer or longer, each capsule containing about 600 viable seeds per gram. Eucalyptus salmonophloia looks much like E. salicola, both having a similar habit and salmon-coloured bark, however, E. salmonophloia is differentiated by its egg-shaped to lance-shaped juvenile leaves and spherical buds. Eucalyptus salicola is also able to tolerate a saline habitat.  Taxonomy and naming  Eucalyptus salmonophloia was first formally described by the botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in 1878 in his book Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae, from samples collected by Ernest Giles from near Victoria Springs. The specific epithet refers to the salmon-coloured bark. The Noongar peoples know the tree as wurak or weerluk. Distribution and habitat Found in large woodland communities, E. salmonophloia is found in the southern Wheatbelt and Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia. In western areas there are remnant populations, extending from the York and Northam areas, south to around Jerramungup mostly as a result of agricultural practices. Eastern occurrences are far less disturbed and extend as far east as Cundeelee to the north around Mt Gibson area and south to around Salmon Gums. The tree usually dominates these communities forming a sparse upper canopy. Found growing in broad valleys, plain and low hills in areas that receive as little as of rain per year it grows in alkaline loamy soils red clay loam or clay and red sandy soils often with gravel. It is found in granite soils in western areas and calcerous soils in eastern areas. Associated species include Eucalyptus salubris, Eucalyptus longicornis, Eucalyptus wandoo and Eucalyptus loxophleba subsp. loxophleba in the overstorey and a huge variety of species in the understorey including Acacia erinacea, Templetonia sulcata, Melaleuca acuminata, Santalum acuminatum, Sclerolaena diacantha, Rhagodia drummondii, Austrostipa trichophylla and Calandrinia calyptrata. Ecology This species of Eucalypt is known to have a life span of over 150 years.  Uses  The timber produced by E. salmonophloia is noted for its durability and is used to make railway sleepers and mining shaft supports. Historically, the mining industry cut down the tree to use for construction and as a fuel source, and along with two acacia species is credited with allowing the development of the goldfields. The state's forest department (1922) promoted the high density of timber as the second strongest in Australia. It is still commonly used for wood fires and makes excellent firewood. It is an excellent species for rehabilitation areas and for areas requiring soil stabilization as it is drought tolerant, frost resistant, fast growing and able to grow in poor soils. The heartwood of the tree is fine-textured, dense with a reddish to dark red-brown colour and has considerable potential for use in high value furniture, flooring, panelling, craftwood and in musical instruments such as flute headpoints. Craftsmen rate the wood as good for turning, machinability, boring, screwholding, stability, sanding, gluing and finishing. Honey flow for apiculture is reported from December to March. The density of green wood is about 1160 kg/m3 with an air- dried density about 1040 kg/m3.

Yuri Vasilievich (–Æ—Ä–∏–π –í–∞—Å–∏–ª—å–µ–≤–∏—á; 30 October 1532 - 24 June 1563) was the only brother of Ivan the Terrible. He was born deaf, and was thus never considered to be a candidate as heir to the Russian throne. He ruled the appanage principality of Uglich on the Volga. Yuri was the second son of Vasily III of Russia and Elena Glinskaya. He was a year and a half old when his father died of a leg abscess, and six when his mother was apparently poisoned. According to letters written by his older brother Ivan, the two children customarily felt neglected and offended by the mighty boyars from the Shuisky and Belsky families. Unlike his brother who spent his spare time in learning theology, Yuri was apparently only interested in food and games including ice-skating. Yuri accompanied his brother during the latter's coronation as Tsar, and was later given a private residence with servants. On 16 June 1552, during the Russo-Kazan war, Yuri was given full charge of state affairs while his brother accompanied the army to Kazan. Yuri was married on 3 November 1547 to Princess Ulyana of Palekh (Paletskaya) and had a son, Vasili, in 1559. The child died 11 months later. Yuri died three years later from natural causes. His wife was sent to the Novodevichy Convent. Yuri's property was inherited by his elder brother. References * Troyat, Henri Ivan le Terrible.

It takes its title from the first line of Sonnet 129. It was first broadcast on BBC Four on 22 November 2005 as part of the supporting programming for the BBC's ShakespeaRe-Told season, but only loosely connected to the rest of the series. Its screenplay was written by William Boyd and the film was directed by John McKay. Lines from the sonnets are presented as thoughts running through Shakespeare's mind. Production The BBC asked Boyd to dramatise the Sonnet's love triangle as a free adaptation of Shakespeare's life. Reception and critical history As a depiction of Shakespeare as a character, it received critical attention in Paul Franssen's Shakespeare's Literary Lives: The Author as Character in Fiction and Film (2016). Franssen primarily sees the plot's love triangle‚Äîbetween Shakespeare, William Herbert (the Fair Youth), and \\"Lucy Negro\\" (the Dark Lady)‚Äîas inherently misogynistic: Shakespeare and Herbert both exploit Negro as a proxy for their own relationship. He views Boyd's choice of a British-Indian actress (Indira Varma), her portrayal as \\"half Moorish, half French\\", and costumed in a traditional Tuareg headdress (playing on the western world's post-9/11 fear of the Muslim world) as a deliberate othering such that Shakespeare and Herbert's exploitation of her becomes a metaphor for the west's meddling in and exploitation of other cultures (a post-colonialist perspective). In \\"Shakespeare's Life on Film and Television: Shakespeare In Love and A Waste of Shame\\" (2016) he also contrasted A Waste of Shame with Shakespeare in Love (1998) to examine \\"the question of how two such different visions of Shakespeare were produced within a decade of each other ‚Ä¶ from the perspectives of genre, themes, historical referentiality, and polyphony.\\" Jane Kingsley-Smith, in \\"Shakespeare's sonnets and the claustrophobic reader: making space in modern Shakespeare fiction\\" (2013), argues that claustrophilia is a thematic and structural motif in the Sonnets, based on analysis of A Waste of Shame and Anthony Burgess' Nothing Like the Sun: A Story of Shakespeare's Love Life (1964). Plot 1609: Shakespeare is struggling to complete his sonnets while plague rages. He sees the body of a young child and remembers the moment in 1596 when he learned of the illness of his son Hamnet while rehearsing a play in London. Returning to Stratford-upon- Avon he was subjected to abuse from his shrewish wife Anne for neglecting them by living in the capital. His son died, and an embarrassing argument between his father John and Anne disrupted the funeral. John later told him that the family was in financial difficulties. William agreed to pay off the debt, but to do so he had to return to London. 1597: Shakespeare receives a bag of money from Mary Sidney, Countess of Pembroke, for writing the procreation sonnets, to encourage her son, the young William Herbert to marry. He meets the young aristocrat and becomes strangely attracted to him. Herbert says that he will meet Shakespeare again when he comes to London. Disturbed by his attraction to the youth, Shakespeare gets drunk in a brothel run by his friend George Wilkins. Wilkins tempts him with a new dusky-skinned \\"half caste\\" called Lucie, just come from France. Shakespeare has sex with her. At a performance of Hamlet, Herbert and his young friends meet up with Shakespeare. They are keen to experience the seedy side of London life, so Shakespeare takes them to Wilkins' brothel. There they enjoy the pleasures on offer but Herbert is shocked to see Wilkins help some men to beat up one of the girls. Shakespeare tells him to ignore it and that the girl is being punished for giving a client syphilis. Shakespeare becomes increasingly close to Herbert and entranced by him, but discovers that his rival Ben Jonson is now one of Herbert's cronies. He also becomes more deeply involved with Lucie. Lucie tells him that she is leaving Wilkins. She now has her own place paid for by another client, but kindly tells Shakespeare that he, not her patron, is her true favorite. Later, Shakespeare visits Herbert's house, but is brushed off by a servant. He realises that Herbert is avoiding him. He follows him and discovers that Lucie has become Herbert's mistress, and that he pays for her lodging. Embittered, he writes Measure for Measure. He meets Herbert again at a performance of the play. He learns that Lucie has gone back to France. The two part awkwardly. A new outbreak of plague leads to the closure of the theatres. Shakespeare, Richard Burbage and William Kempe discuss the options for their acting troupe. However, Shakespeare starts to notice worrying signs of illness on his body. He returns to Stratford to get a diagnosis from John Hall and is told that he does not have the plague, but he does have syphilis. He writes up his sonnets for publication.

Its last assignment was with Far East Air Forces. The Headquarters were based at several locations with Forward command moving with the campaigns. It was inactivated through being redesignated the 20th Fighter Wing and later, the 46th Fighter Wing on 24 August 1948. History The command was established in Hawaii in February 1942. From its inception until March 1945, the mission of the command was the air defense of the Hawaii Territory. Within ten days after the Attack on Pearl Harbor, the VII Interceptor Command consolidated all Hawaiian Islands defense units. In May 1942, the unit was redesignated the VII Fighter Command, constituting the fighter arm of Seventh Air Force, and its defensive responsibilities expanded to include Midway Island; Canton Island Airfield in the Phoenix Islands and Christmas Island Airfield in the Line Islands. It's assigned units were deployed to forward bases in the Central Pacific Area in rotational deployments. During the assault on the Marshall Islands by Seventh Air Force bombers that began in late 1943, VII Fighter Command pioneered the use of long range fighter escort in the Pacific theater. B-25 Mitchell medium bombers attacking the island chain were being harassed by Japanese fighters who would begin their attacks after the bombing run and break off at the point they estimated to be the maximum range of Seventh Air Force fighters. The Seventh eventually fitted some of its P-40 Warhawks with belly tanks, and on 26 January 1944, sent them out to wait above the clouds for the pursuing Japanese. They shot down ten enemy fighters in three minutes, effectively ending interception of the bombers over the Marshalls. By March 1944, VII Fighter Command was back on Oahu for regrouping, reinforcement, aircraft transition, and general reorganization in preparation for the Marianas campaign. Its strength was increased from four squadrons to three complete fighter groups of three squadrons each. It was during the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign in mid-1944 that the command began their transition from a static defensive unit in the rear to the spearhead of the attacks on Japan. VII Fighter Command participated in the seizure and consolidation of that island group and, more importantly, gained valuable experience in long-range operations, escorting Thirteenth Air Force B-24 Liberators on strikes to Iwo Jima and Truk from its base on Saipan. Beginning in March 1945, the command was reassigned to Twentieth Air Force on Iwo Jima, which had been seized by Marine Corps units to provide emergency landing fields for B-29 Superfortresses. From its forward airfields on Iwo Jima, its mission became the command and control echelon of fighter groups providing escort of B-29 Superfortress bombers operating from bases in the Mariana Islands. The command's units flew Very Long Range (VLR) bomber escort operations against the armed forces of the Empire of Japan. On 7 April 1945, 119 P-51 Mustangs of VII Fighter Command lifted off from Iwo Jima on the first Very Long Range (VLR) mission by land-based fighter aircraft against the Japanese mainland. Off the coast of Honshu they rendezvoused with more than 100 B-29 Superfortresses for an attack on the Nakajima aircraft plant in Tokyo. The B-29s had been taking heavy losses to Japanese fighters on these Empire strikes, but the 110 to 125 who came up to greet them this day were in for a surprise. VII Fighter command pilots described the Japanese, who attacked singly during the bomb run and immediately after, as easy targets for the Mustangs that broke off in pairs to engage them. Combined, the American fighters and bombers accounted for 71 Japanese aircraft destroyed, with 30 probably destroyed of the 44 that were damaged. After the end of the war, the command was redesignated a Wing, with the elimination of the command echelon in the postwar Air Force. It moved to Guam in the Marianas and remained assigned to the Far East Air Force. The organization was inactivated on 24 August 1948.

It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Serokomla. It lies approximately south of ≈Åuk√≥w and north of the regional capital Lublin. The village has a population of 1,060. It was stripped of city rights during the Russian Partition in 1869. History The history of Serokomla dates back to 1573, when a nobleman Piotr Kijenski founded a town based on Magdeburg rights. The town laid in the Lukow Land, Lublin Voivodeship (1474‚Äì1795) in the province of Lesser Poland. It was bought by the Firlej family in the late 16th century and remained in private hands until the Partitions of Poland. After the Congress of Vienna (1815) Serokomla found itself in the Russian-controlled Congress Poland, in which it remained until World War I. It became part of the Lublin Voivodeship (1919‚Äì39) in the Second Polish Republic. World War II In early October 1939, most of Serokomla was destroyed by the Wehrmacht, during the Battle of Kock (1939). After the battle, the Germans shot 32 Polish soldiers and civilians there in revenge. On April 14, 1940, the SS with the Gestapo captured 217 local inhabitants including women and children. All were shot by Sonderdienst formation in a mass execution nearby. A small Nazi exploitation ghetto was set up for the Jewish community. Then on the morning of September 22, 1942, the travelling Nazi German Reserve Police Battalion 101 under the command of Captain Wohlauf rounded up the 200 to 300 Jews of Serokomla and shot them in the necks one by one at the crest of a waste dump outside the town. The bodies were left unburied and the Germans departed at 3pm. Captain Wohlauf didn't even remember later he was at Serokomla amid the many deportation actions to death camps they conducted in the vicinity.

It is based on the biblical story of Noah's Ark with its focus in the animals' point of view. The story tends to follow the traditional story; however, both the humans and the animals involved are seen as anthropomorphic beings. Plot In the opening scene, animals and humans are seen acting out the seven deadly sins: pride (the peacock), envy (the snake), sloth (the sloth), lust (the hedgehog), gluttony (the toad), wrath (the mandrill), and greed (the human). This results in their mutual doom, as they are killed or captured and taken to market where the remains of the killed animals are sold and the survivors are enslaved. God surveys the market, witnessing the assorted evils, and declares to his sidekick Angel that he will impose Judgment Day upon the sinful world. A chance encounter with the gentle and devoted Noah, who purchases the freedom of the enslaved man despite his own poverty, convinces him to give humanity one last chance. God appears as a heavenly light to Noah and tells him to build an ark, upon which he will board his family and two of every animal, to survive the world-enveloping flood He will send. Noah then informs his family. Already unhappy with Noah's leadership, they assume he has lost his mind, particularly when he fashions a model of the ark out of mashed potatoes and begins cutting down his father's forest for lumber to build it. Noah sells his home to the greedy merchants Farfan and Esther for a flock of pigeons to deliver messages to all the animals of the world. However, the birds immediately abandon their task and head for a jungle strip club to celebrate their freedom. Only one pigeon, Pepe, remains on mission, but is attacked by the animals he encounters. Pepe is rescued by a kind lioness named Kairel, secretary to the aging King Sabu and Queen Oriana. Kairel delivers Noah's message to Sabu, who calls an emergency meeting of the animal world. Sabu's spoiled libertine son Xiro has gotten a mangled portion of one of Noah's messages and mistakes the announcement of apocalyptic doom as an invitation to a party cruise. Xiro throws a tantrum after Kairel II disqualifies all of Xiro's potential cruise- mates for lack of intelligence, and the tiger Dagnino sees an opportunity to seize the crown of the post-flood world's animal kingdom. As Noah single- handedly completes the ark (an impressive but not Biblically accurate craft with a helm, thousands of luxury cabins, and other features more suited to a modern cruise liner), the animals arrive en masse. Kairel has been sent along to organize and supervise the trip, but the procession grinds to a halt when the herbivores demand assurance that the carnivores won't devour them once they're aboard. Xiro fails to make a decision, allowing Dagnino to gain the animals' respect by declaring that he will personally punish any act of violence on the voyage. As the rain begins to fall, the animals stampede onto the ark. Xiro's selected companion Bruma I pauses to taunt the doomed Kairel II, only to be smashed through the gangplanks by a toppling hippopotamus. Xiro impulsively grabs Kairel II and brings her aboard the ark in Bruma/Kairel I's place. Inspecting Noah's cottage, Farfan and Esther notice the ark in the distance. Their ridicule turns to panic as the water rises around them, and they barely manage to scramble onto the ark unnoticed. Inside, Kairel II attempts to maintain some semblance of order and convince Xiro to take his duties seriously, but Xiro flees to a hastily assembled club. There he becomes infatuated with the seductive panther Panthy, as she dances while performing I Want to Live, a carnivore-themed parody of I Will Survive. However, Panthy is part of Dagnino's small cabal of carnivores who intend to discredit and overthrow Xiro, then establish a new order in which all prey species are bred and fattened in captivity until they are consumed. Kairel finally gets Xiro to face the truth of their situation, and Xiro makes a sincere effort at governance. He grows closer to Kairel, but finds bureaucracy stifling and is still infatuated with Panthy to Kairel II's jealous dismay. Trapped below decks with the animals, Farfan and Esther disguise themselves as a fictional animal species (\\"grasswhoppers\\") to avoid being discovered as humans. The disguises backfire when the pair's misadventures leave them under a pile of animal dung which is hauled to the top deck for disposal. Believing a pair of dangerous wild animals have escaped the hold, Noah's sons and daughters attempt to catch or kill them. In the chaos, Farfan, Esther and Noah plunge back into the depths of the ark. Noah's eldest son Japeth volunteers to rescue him, but quickly retreats upon hearing frightening noises below (which turn out to be the hippopotamus suffering intestinal distress). Noah's faithful pigeon Pepe volunteers to fly down to Noah, but instead plummets helplessly because of his injuries. Noah's sons fight over the helm and break it. Ashamed and desperate, Noah's family prays for God's help. Farfan and Esther knock Noah unconscious and abandon him. Feeling cocky with Noah out of the way, Farfan begins bullying the smaller animals before inadvertently striking Dagnino. The two humans escape uninjured, but Dagnino tears off the lower half of Farfan's 'hide,' which he needs for his scheme. Panthy lures Xiro to her cabin, where Dagnino's minions use the torn disguise and tomato juice to frame Xiro for the 'murder' of the grasswhoppers. Dagnino assumes control and has Xiro locked up in a storeroom, but Xiro's herbivore friends quickly unravel the deceit and convince Kairel of the truth. Noah regains consciousness and tends to Pepe before sending him out a porthole to find land. Xiro has been imprisoned directly below and overhears Noah's words of encouragement, mistaking them for a personal message from 'the voice of his lineage.' When his friends free him, Xiro races to confront Dagnino, who has captured the other herbivores. (Xiro's group challenges Dagnino with the Maori ritual known as a haka.) The battle between Dagnino and Xiro ends when the ark, having drifted into the Arctic, runs into an ice floe. The sudden stop pitches Dagnino and his minions through a wall, in which their heads are stuck fast. The animals begin to panic again, threatening to flee onto the ice until Xiro finally asserts his authority with a mighty roar. Xiro delivers a speech that rallies the animals behind him (even many of Dagnino's gang, to Dagnino's chagrin). On the upper deck, Noah has made his way back up to his family, who are likewise now rallied behind him. Noah and his sons begin repairing the helm. God relents and allows Angel to shut off the rain. Xiro realizes the pitch for the ship's torches will melt the ice, and puts the animals to work spreading barrels of it across the floe. Xiro lights the pitch, breaking up the floe and freeing the ark. Farfan and Esther, believing the ark has run aground, break out and fall onto the floe just as the ark departs. They are last seen fleeing the hungry polar bears who have elected to remain behind in their natural habitat. Pepe returns to the ark with an olive leaf, but is once again (accidentally) clobbered before he can reach his goal. Xiro and Kairel reconcile their different ways as the animals (including a caged Panthy, and Dagnino's gang still stuck in the section of wall) celebrate with a party on the open deck. God enjoys the festivities from above, but admonishes Angel for leaving the rainbow switched on. During the end credits, God and Angel bicker over the contents of God's work-in-progress book.

This form of God is depicted as a man of African descent with blond hair (as opposed to most other depictions, where God is depicted as a Caucasian man with white hair). *Andrio Chavarro- Angel: God's humble aide, he is typically the one who does all of God's work (this includes unleashing the flood and stopping it). For most of the movie, he is seen writing God's book and is often asking God for advice. *Joe Carey- Noah: An elderly man with the heart of a saint and the main protagonist (for the humans' point of view). A holy man, he and his family are chosen to be the saviors of humanity and all of the animals. He is easily sighted by his long grey and white beard, his glasses and his simple maroon clothes. *Kay Brady- Naamah: Noah's wife. Though she has been willing to stand beside Noah for years, even she has become concerned for Noah's mental health. Like Noah, she is heavily religious. During the trip to the New World, Naama has to do everything she can to ensure that her family stays together. *Andrio Chavarro- Japheth: Noah's oldest child. He is distinguished by his brown hair and his fairly light-colored clothes. *Oscar Cheda- Shem: The youngest of Noah's children. He is the most loyal of Noah's sons and (after Naama) is often the first to stand by Noah. He is more heavily set than his brothers, which helps him stand out amongst them, and he also stands out because of his red hair, his beard and his blue clothes. *Brandon Morris- Ham: Noah's middle child (and the only African one). He sticks out a bit more than his brothers because of his large, black afro and colorful red clothes. *Lissa Grossman- Miriam: One of Noah's daughters-in-law. More emotional than the other females of the house, she is often the one who is hurt the most easily; however, she is much kinder than her other sisters-in- law. She is married to Ham. She stands out because of her red hair and blue clothes. *Loren Lusch- Sara: Another of Noah's daughters-in-law. The most temperamental of the group, she is married to Shem. She tends to be very frank with the people she meets. She stands out because of her dark hair and white clothes. *Aubrey Shavonn- Edith: The last of Noah's daughters-in-law. Calm and cool, she brings some sense to any situation (though she can be a tad sarcastic, if the need arises). She is married to Japeth. She stands out because of her blond hair and red clothes. *Terrell Hardcastle- Pepe: A white dove, he is the only one of his kind to actually deliver the messages that Noah sent out to the animals. A running gag throughout the movie is that he is constantly getting hurt (quite by accident, in most cases). *Oscar Cheda- King Sabu: An elderly lion who was the king of all animals before the flood. Receiving Noah's message of the coming apocalypse from Pepe, he calls a gathering of all the animals in his kingdom to warn his people. Though he doesn't force the animals to go to Noah's ark (as some animals believed it to be a trap), he made it clear that if Noah's apocalyptic warning wasn't heeded and if it turned out to be a reality, those who failed to listen would have only themselves to blame. Knowing that his life will be ending soon, he (and the other animals whose times are almost up) stays behind and lets the procession of animals leave for the ark, declaring them \\"the salvation of the new world\\". It is believed that he was a wise and just ruler (which may explain why all of the animals were willing to congregate on his order). *Heidi Harris- Queen Oriana: A lioness who was the wife of King Sabu and the queen of all the animals before the flood. Knowing that the time would come when her son, Xiro, would succeed her and her husband, King Sabu, she is more than willing to allow Xiro to partake in the journey to the New World. She trusts Kairel II deeply, having her as a royal aide and trusting her to do some important tasks (i.e. ensuring that the pilgrimage to the ark runs smoothly). **Harris also provides the voice of Bruma/Kairel I, a lioness and a minor antagonist from the animal side of the story. Though she chosen as one of Xiro's potential mates, Kairel II (who was ordered to screen each of Xiro's potential companion candidates) rejected her because she was \\"too skinny [and had] no brains\\"; despite this, Xiro took her along as a companion, anyway. It is apparent that she isn't a very good person, as Kairel claims that, in her youth, she did some regrettable things that made her a wholly unimpeachable woman; she insists, though, that she \\"had no idea what she was doing\\". It's apparent that she and Kairel don't get along; to be honest, she hasn't built up much of a good relationship with the other animals in the jungle, either (judging the fact that most of them have nothing nice to say to her). She (never) lives long enough to get on-board Noah's ark because of an unexpected chain reaction accident that ultimately either smashes her flat (courtesy of a hippopotamus) or leaves her to drown. *James Keller- Xiro: A lion, the son of King Sabu and Queen Oriana, Xiro is expected to be a leader to all of the animals; despite this, the prince is (at first) more concerned with having fun and enjoying himself (though he does mature as the story goes on). Xiro is something of a womanizer, as he is easily swayed by beautiful creatures, which often leaves him in dire situations. Despite his being a predator, he actually has a friendship with herbivores (among them Alvaro the pig, a panda and a mole). **Keller also served as the voice of Farfan: One of the two con artists who proves to be a thorn in the side of Noah, his family and the animals. He is somewhat arrogant, as he states that he \\"has a gift for finding idiots\\". The shorter of the two con artists, he is more easily distinguished than his female partner-in-crime by his green skin and his baldness. *Tom Wahl- Bombay: An orangutan and one of the minor protagonists for the animal side of the story. A close friend to Xiro, Bombay proves to be a spiritual guide - providing wisdom and advising Xiro on taking a course that will benefit as many people as possible -and a skilled massage therapist. On board the ark, Bombay keeps himself busy as the owner of \\"The Dive\\"- a small entertainment club down in the lower recesses of the ship. Though Bombay looks like any other normal orangutan, his pink bow helps him stand out among a crowd. *Chloe Dolandis- Kairel II: A lioness. It is apparent that she is high-ranking in the lion society, as she served as an aide to Queen Orianna. She can be strict (having worked with royals, she most likely had to learn about responsibility very quickly) and has a secret crush on Xiro. *Antonio Amadeo- Pity The Parrot: One of the more prominent birds in the movie, Pity is famous as an entertainer in the ark's comedy club \\"The Dive\\". Having been around humans most of his life, Pity always has a hilarious story to tell. He sticks out because of his partly overgrown upper beak, his body (which is mostly covered in green feathers) and his loud voice. *Wayne LeGette- Dagnino: A tiger, realizing all too well that the oncoming flood will mean a new world order, he conspires with several other carnivores in an effort to take over the ark and make himself king. Possessing both savage brawn and impressive mental prowess, he plots to disgrace Xiro and take his place as king of the beasts. Despite the fact that there is a female tiger already on board the ark, Dagnino seems to be in a relationship with Panthy. *Danny Paul- Coco: A crocodile. He prefers to let his brute strength do the work for him, as he isn't much of a talker. He serves as something of an enforcer to Dagnino. He seems to be blind in his left eye (which is entirely yellow). *Todd Allen Durkin- Patricio: A vulture. He is usually seen sitting on Coco's shoulder in a fashion similar to the way that a parrot sits on a partially blind man's shoulder. *Gerald Owens- Cachito: A puma. He is perhaps the most minor of the animal mutineers, as he rarely (if ever) says anything. *Barry Tarallo- Wolfgang: A wolf. Despite being a mutineer, he actually seems to care for the well-being of Xiro. *Heather Gallaher- Panthy: A black panther who is the only female of the animal mutineers. She uses her sharp mind to help her fellow conspirators. She serves as the super-star of \\"The Dive\\". *Rayner Grannchen- Alvaro: A pig and one of the minor protagonists of the movie. Though he is hesitant to trust predators at first, as the story goes on, he develops something of a friendship with Xiro. Though he is somewhat low on the food chain, he is surprisingly brave, as he openly shows his hatred towards most of the carnivores. *Amy London- Esther: The second of the con artists. Apparently, she comes from a family of criminals, as she mentions that her grandfather was a swindler, but he ended up killed by a former partner (who may have been Farfan, given his reaction). She has some proficiency with a needle. The taller of the two con artists, she is distinguished by a healthier skin coloration, red hair and earrings. *Deborah Sherman Gorelo- Lily: An orangutan and one of the minor protagonists for the animals' point of view. Despite being a female, she is something of a brute, as she can easily take out anyone (regardless as to whether they are friend or foe) with but one punch. Despite this, she is a softie deep down, as she does care deeply for her mate, Bombay, and will protect him to the end. Her shaggy haircut and dark fur help her to stick out amongst a crowd.

Constructed in 1927, the bridge provides a road link across a busy boating channel. In February 2012 a second bridge was completed intending to operate in conjunction with the existing bridge Location Poole Bridge is situated on the western end of Poole Quay and spans across a narrow channel between Poole Harbour and Holes Bay, a tidal inland lake which lies to the north of the harbour. The bridge provides a road link as part of the A350 road between Poole's town centre and the suburb of Hamworthy, avoiding a journey of around Holes Bay. History The existing bridge is the third to be located on the site. William Ponsonby, a Member of Parliament for Poole, was responsible for building the first bridge in 1834. Ponsonby promoted his own Act of Parliament to build the wooden toll bridge at a cost of ¬£9,612. However, the bridge had a steep gradient that caused problems for horses and in 1885 it was replaced by an iron swing bridge with gentler approach gradients. It was privately owned and collected tolls up until 1926, when it was purchased by the Borough of Poole and replaced with the third and present bridge which opened in on 11 March 1927. The opening ceremony included a blue ribbon cut by the Mayor, as well as a visit from \\"Father Neptune\\". It has seven time-tabled lifts a day and another ten unscheduled lifts for commercial boats and it is estimated to lift over 6,000 times a year. Poole Borough Council marked the bridge as worn out with cracks appearing in the concrete, closing it for repairs costing ¬£4.2 million for nine months from September 2016. Both sides of the bridge will be demolished and rebuilt, it will be expected to last a further 120 years after the repairs. The bridge reopened in January 2018 after many months delays and a sixteen month closure.

Climate change in West Virginia is an ongoing concern. Most of the state has warmed one-half to one degree Fahrenheit () in the last century, and heavy rainstorms are becoming more frequent. In the coming decades, a changing climate is likely to increase flooding, harm ecosystems, increase some health problems, and possibly threaten some recreational activities. The average temperature in Charleston, West Virginia, has increased over the last century, and precipitation has increased by up to 10% in many parts of the state. Over the next century, climate in West Virginia may change even more. For example, based on projections made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and results from the United Kingdom Hadley Centre‚Äôs climate model (HadCM2), a model that accounts for both greenhouse gases and aerosols, by 2100 temperatures in West Virginia could increase by in winter, spring, and summer (with a range of ) and in fall (with a range of ). Precipitation is estimated to increase by 20% (with a range of 10‚Äì30%) in all seasons, slightly more in summer. Other climate models may show different results, especially regarding estimated changes in precipitation. The impacts described in the sections that follow take into account estimates from different models. The frequency of extreme hot days in summer would increase because of the general warming trend. It is not clear how the severity of storms might be affected, although an increase in the frequency and intensity of summer thunderstorms is possible.  Impacts   Human health  Warming and other climate changes could expand the habitat and infectiousness of disease-carrying insects, thus increasing the potential for transmission of diseases such as malaria and dengue. Warmer temperatures could increase the incidence of Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases in West Virginia, because populations of ticks, and their rodent hosts, could increase under warmer temperatures and increased vegetation.  Water resources and flooding  The topography of West Virginia is rugged, and many of the rivers in the state are influenced by winter snow accumulation and spring snowmelt. A warmer climate would lead to an earlier spring snowmelt, resulting in higher streamflows in winter and spring. Lower streamflows and lake levels in the summer and fall could affect the dependability of surface water supplies, particularly since many of the streams in West Virginia have low flows in the summer. The growing tourism and recreation industries such as whitewater rafting also could be affected by lower summer streamflows. Groundwater sources also could be reduced by lower spring and summer recharge. Lower summer streamflows and warmer temperatures could affect water quality by concentrating pollutant levels. This could exacerbate existing problems with acid drainage from coal mines, high concentrations of fecal coliform bacteria, and industrial pollution from the manufacturing plants along the floodplains of the Ohio and Kanawha rivers. Increases in rainfall could mitigate these effects. Higher rainfall, however, could contribute to increased flooding. Most homes and businesses in West Virginia are built on flat, narrow valley floors and are susceptible to flooding. More rain also could increase erosion and exacerbate pollution in runoff areas devoted to manufacturing, coal mining, and oil and gas extraction. = 2016 West Virginia flood and resiliency = During the June 2016 West Virginia flood, over 10 inches of rain fell, much of it within 12-18 hours. The National Weather Service described the magnitude and intensity of the rain as a \\"once in 1,000 years\\" event. A 2018 report by FEMA on lessons learned suggests that this sort of rain event and flooding may occur more frequently than has previously been expected. One scientist from West Virginia University who concurs with these conclusions has emphasized the importance of \\"honest conversations about climate change and what it means for West Virginia\\" in order to prepare for more intense precipitation events. The West Virginia State Resiliency Office was created in response to the disaster. In January 2020, the office was described as \\"barely functioning,\\" and rebuilding from the flood remained incomplete.  Agriculture  In West Virginia, production agriculture is a $400 million annual industry, three-fourths of which comes from livestock, mainly cattle and poultry. Very few of the farmed acres are irrigated. The major crop in the state is hay. Hay yields could increase by about 30% as a result of climate change, leading to changes in acres farmed and production. Farmed acres could remain constant or could decrease by as much as 30% in response to changes in prices, for example, possible decreases in hay prices. Livestock and dairy production may not be affected, unless summer temperatures rise significantly and conditions become significantly drier. Under these conditions, livestock tend to gain less weight and pasture yields decline, limiting forage.  Forests  With changes in climate, the extent of forested areas in West Virginia could change little or decline by 5‚Äì10%. However, the types of trees dominating those forests and woodlands are likely to change. Forested areas could be increasingly dominated by pine and scrub oaks, replacing many of the eastern hardwoods common throughout West Virginia. In areas where richer soils are prevalent, southern pines could increase their range and density, and in areas with poorer soils, which are more common in West Virginia's forests, scrub oaks of little commercial value (e.g., post oak and blackjack oak) could increase their range. As a result, the character of forests in West Virginia could change. Climate change also could affect the success of tree plantings to stabilize open-face mining sites.  Ecosystems  The state of West Virginia is 97% forested, and much of this cover is in high-elevation areas. These areas contain some of the last remaining stands of red spruce, which are seriously threatened by acid rain and could be further stressed by changing climate. These forests provide habitat for many plants and animals, including the varying hare, red squirrel, the endangered Virginia northern flying squirrel, and the threatened Cheat Mountain salamander. Whereas species of lower elevations at least have the potential to move upward in response to warming temperatures, those in high elevation areas do not. Given a sufficient change in climate, these spruce forests could be substantially reduced, or could disappear. West Virginia has the fourth highest number of caves (including 3,300 limestone caves) in the nation and 11 of the world's 50 longest caves. At least eight species of bats, including two that are federally endangered (Indiana bat and the Virginia bigeared bat), use caves as winter hibernation roosts or to raise young in the summer. One cave protects over 5,000 Indiana bats each winter, and another contains the largest known concentration of hibernating Virginia big-eared bats as well as the largest known maternity colony. Higher-than-normal winter temperatures could boost temperatures inside cave bat roosting sites, which has been shown to cause higher mortality due to increased winter body weight loss in endangered Indiana bats (e.g., an increase of during winter hibernation has been associated with a 42% increase in the rate of body mass loss). The south branch cave beetle is another endangered cave dweller. Another unique West Virginia ecosystem is in the Ice Mountain Preserve. In a small slope area there are 60 small holes and openings at the base of a rock talus whose vents blow air year round. As a result, high elevation boreal plants group around the cold air vents, where ice can be seen well into May. The effects of gradually warming temperatures are already noticeable on Ice Mountain, and ice around the vents is disappearing earlier in the year. This could adversely impact the boreal plants found in this system.

It was first discovered in the early 1960s by the French explorer Th√©odore Monod. Monod followed up on information provided by local hunters, searching for evidence to confirm the magnitude of the historical trans-Saharan copper trade. into the desert, he located bundles of cowrie shells and ingots of brass wrapped in ropes and matting and hidden in the sand. The site was originally thought to be the site of a caravan wreck, but Monod believed that the valuables had been hidden intentionally, either by the travellers seeking to prevent a bandit attack, or by bandits hoping to retrieve the items later. It is unclear where the caravan originated from, or what prevented the treasure from being retrieved.  Analysis  Milled cowrie shells of the type used for currency All told, Monod recovered 2,085 brass ingots of approximately in length, weighing up to each. They were tied up in bundles of 100 ingots each. He believed that each camel in a caravan could carry four bundles, or all together. The entire hoard weighed approximately two tons. Analysis of the ingots indicates that they are a brass alloy of approximately 80% copper with 20% zinc. They have been dated to approximately the 11th‚Äì12th centuries CE. Analysis of the lead isotopes in two of the ingots found that the metal in the ingots was consistent with ore from northwest Europe, indicating that the metal had possibly come to Africa from Europe. The cowrie shells have been subject to much less inspection than the ingots, but are presumed to have originated in the Maldives.

His family were regular movie-goers, visiting the cinema several times a week. Yodogawa began accompanying his family at age four. By the age of seven he proved himself to be a budding cinemaphile; he would often go to the movies on his own, seeing as many as ten films in one week. Career in film criticism Upon graduating from Kobe High School, Yodogawa started his journalistic career working for the magazine Eiga Sekai (Movie World). After World War II he became Chief Editor of Eiga no Tomo (Film Friend), a post he held for twenty years. After his tenure at Eiga no Tomo, Yodogawa went on to do freelance work in radio, television and print, all in relation to film. In 1962 he began working at TV Asahi as the host of Sunday Western Movie Theatre, a job to which he was so devoted that he did not miss a single appearance until just a week before his death in 1998. List of guest speakers at Okuma Auditorium at Waseda University in the 1990s Last retrieved January 9, 2010 During his three decades as the show's host he interviewed film stars \\"ranging from Charlie Chaplin to Steven Seagal\\". He is also known for closing each show with his signature line \\"Sayonara, sayonara, sayonara\\". Love of film Yodogawa's first love was silent film. He preferred silent movies over sound film because he felt that silent films depicted real life and were easy to understand, even without Japanese captions. Over his career, Yodogawa became increasingly critical of modern Japanese film, once stating: \\"It is because I love film so much that I hate those incompetent and uninteresting new movies.\\" In contrast, he believed that even the worst movies were worth watching; he felt that all films had at least one redeeming feature, such as a well composed shot. Near the end of his life he did however show interest in the new style of film-making of Takeshi Kitano, to whom he referred as \\"the true successor to Kurosawa\\". Influence Yodogawa's appreciation of film is notable amongst the film industry of Japan; fellow critic and scholar Shigehiko Hasumi once said: \\"We usually watch films with the intellect, but Yodogawa watched them with every fibre of his being.\\" The award-winning actor Hiroyuki Sanada also credited Yodogawa as having introduced him to foreign movies.

A Land Fit For Heroes was originally the working title of the first volume, and was retained as the series title after first Morgan and the UK publisher, and then the US publisher, decided to use the current title The Steel Remains.Interview with Richard Morgan The following two volumes, The Cold Commands, and The Dark Defiles, were published in 2011 and 2014 respectively. Plot Ringil Eskiath is a war hero from a conflict between humans and the lizard-like Scaled Folk, although he is now shunned by his aristocratic family in the city of Trelayne, part of the Northern League, due to his homosexuality and cynicism. He is contacted by his mother in his self-imposed exile after a distant cousin, Sherrin, is sold into legal slavery to pay off her husband's debt. He returns to Trelayne and his investigations reveal the presence of a Dwenda, an other- worldly being who lives outside of conventional time, who is aiding the slavers. He fights the Dwenda, named Seethlaw, but is captured and taken to the Aldrain Marches, the grey places between worlds. After a mentally grueling journey, they emerge at Ennishmann, a marshland and the site of an ancient and destroyed Dwenda city. Two of Ringils comrades in the war against the Scaled Folk are also drawn towards Ennishmann. Archeth serves, somewhat reluctantly, at the Imperial Yhelteth court. She is half Kiriath, a mysterious people who arrived in the world centuries ago and who aided the humans against the lizards before departing to a destination unknown. She is dispatched to investigate an attack on a port and discovers evidence that suggest Dwenda involvement. The Kiriath banished the Dwenda from the world many years ago and feared their return. Egar Dragonbane is Majak, a nomadic people who farm the steppes. After failing to adapt fully to his post-war position as clan-master he survives an assassination attempt by his brothers after apparent divine intervention by one of the tribal gods. Archeth, following the trail from the port, and Egar, directed by the deity, both head towards Ennishmann. Ringil, who has become lovers with Seethlaw, learns that the Dwenda aim to re-emerge into the world after instigating a war between the League and the Empire. Seethlaw leads him to Sherrin who is being held captive with the rest of the Ennish human population. She is released into Ringil's custody and he, Seethlaw and a detachment of Dwenda soldiers begin to head south. They encounter Egar at an inn and his presence leads Ringil to turn against Seethlaw. They escape on a river and arrive in a small village, where Archeth and the Imperial troops who accompanied her are searching for signs of the Dwenda. After an initial confrontation, the Imperials agree to join them in making a stand against the Dwenda. The Dwenda attack and in the ensuing battle, most of the Imperials are killed. Ringil kills Seethlaw himself, and leaves with Sherrin to return her to her family after he bids farewell to Archeth and Egar, who also survive the battle.

It is common and widespread along the coast and adjacent ranges. Description Zieria smithii is a shrub which grows to a height of and is sometimes robust or at other times spindly. Its leaves are composed of three leaflets with the middle leaflet oblong to lance-shaped long, and wide with a pointed tip. The upper surface of the leaflets is a darker green than the lower side, dotted with oil glands and mostly glabrous. The leaf stalk is long and the leaves are strongly aromatic when crushed. The flowers are usually white and are arranged in groups of up to 60 in upper leaf axils, the groups shorter than the leaves and each flower in diameter. There are four triangular sepal lobes about long. The four petals are long and slightly hairy. In common with other zierias, there are only four stamens. Flowering occurs in autumn and spring and is followed by the fruit which is a capsule with three or four sections each containing one or two reddish brown to black striped seeds. Taxonomy and naming Zieria smithii was first formally described in 1810 by George Jackson and the description was published in The Botanist's Repository for New, and Rare Plants. The specific epithet (smithii) honours James Edward Smith who established the genus Zieria.

Background In the fall of 1987, Thomas Corbin was driving under the influence as he drove his automobile across the center line of a New York highway and collided with two oncoming vehicles. Brenda Dirago, the driver of the second vehicle, died in this accident while her husband was seriously injured. Later that same day, Corbin was charged with DUI and pleaded guilty.

Usually it entails either a strategic change in an enemy's military posture,p.14, Gartner intentions or ongoing operations, or achieving a strategic victory over the enemy that ends the conflict, although the goal can be set in terms of diplomatic or economic conditions, defined by purely territorial gains, or the evidence that the enemy's will to fight has been broken.p.91, Newell Sometimes the strategic goal can be to limit the scope of the conflict.p.29, Aron  Description  It is the highest level of organisational achievement in a military organisation, and is usually defined by the national defence policy. In terms of goal assignment it corresponds to operations performed by a front or a fleet on a theatre scale, and by an Army group or, during the World War II, by a Red Army Front.

The first era consists of the Indo-Aryan inheritance from their ancestors, who once lived at the regions of the now extinct Saraswati River, and later migrated to Goa possibility due to the drying up of the river and/or Muslim invasion. The second era was the Lusitanian legacy, due to the conversion of their Hindu ancestors in Goa to Roman Catholicism by the Portuguese, and the final era being the migration of these Roman Catholics in Goa to Mangalore and other parts of South Canara between the mid-16th and mid-18th centuries, forming a new Mangalorean Catholic identity, and the subsequent growth and development of the community.: \\"In fact the Aryan Inheritance and the Lusitanian Legacy may be regarded as the first two of the three major eras in the history of our community, the third and final era being the southward migration to Mangalore and other parts of Kanara between the mid 16th and mid 18th centuries, and the subsequent growth and development of the fledgling community.\\" Several centuries of living in South Canara gave these Catholics an identity of their own.: \\"Four centuries of living in South Kanara gave these Catholics an identity of their own. Thus they are commonly known as Mangalorean Catholics.\\" The Roman Catholics from Goa migrated to Mangalore in three major waves, the first after 1560, the second after 1570, and the third in about 1683. The first wave of migrants left due to the Goa Inquisition of 1560. The second and third waves left Goa because of famines, epidemics, and political upheavals such as the Portuguese-Maratha wars. During Hyder Ali's regime, the community had flourished. Soon after his son Tippu Sultan gained possession of Mangalore in January 1784, he issued orders to seize the Christians in Canara, confiscate their estates, and deport them to Seringapatam. They had to suffer extreme hardships, torture, death, and persecutions during the captivity. Many Christians were forcibly converted to Islam. Of the 60,000-80,000 Christians taken captive, only 15,000-20,000 made it out alive as Christians. The captivity ended with the death of Tippu in the Battle of Seringapatam (1799). Ancestral roots Traditional accounts of the ancestral roots of Mangalorean Catholics have taught that they are descended from the Indo-Aryans who lived on the banks of the now extinct Saraswati River. That is the Goud Saraswath Brahmins. Most historians agree that the Aryans descended into India from the areas of present-day Iran, and some came by themselves, while others came with their leaders in search of territorial expansions. The Saraswati river dried up in long stretches around 1500 BCE, when its source in the Himalayas got diverted into the Yamuna River due to sand deposition and river piracy. Due to the harshness in their native environments, several Indo-Aryan groups migrated to various different locations across India. According to Historian Alan Machado Prabhu, the modern Mangalorean Catholic community is mainly descended from two Indo-Aryan groups: the group which migrated to the Konkan coast and Goa; and the group which migrated to Bengal.: \\"Originating, so far as is known, from the banks of the legendary Sarasvati river, some members of this group moved south towards the Konkan coast and Goa, others moved east towards Bengal. Linguistic research provides ample evidence of the common origin of the two groups. It is from these two groups that the ancestry of the modern Mangalorean Catholic community derives.\\" The Indo-Aryans are thought to have first migrated to Goa beginning in 600 BCE, and continuing in several waves until 400 CE. The Goud Saraswat Brahmins are believed to have migrated to Goa later around 300 CE from the Saraswati River settlement in Bengal. They also claim their origin to the Brahmins who lived on the banks of the now extinct Saraswati River. Pre-migration era St Mary's Islands in South Canara, where the Portuguese explorer Vasco Da Gama landed in 1498 All records of an early existence of Christians in South Canara were lost at the time of their deportation by Tippu Sultan in 1784. Hence, it is not known when exactly Christianity was introduced in South Canara, although it is possible that Syrian Christians settled in South Canara just as they did in Kerala, a state south of Canara. The Italian traveler Marco Polo recorded that there were considerable trading activities between the Red Sea and the Canara coast in the 13th century. It can be surmised that foreign Christian merchants were visiting the coastal towns of South Canara during that period for commerce and possibly some Christian priests might have accompanied them for evangelistic work. In April 1321, the French Dominican friar Jordanus Catalani of Severac (in south-western France) with four other friars landed at Thana. He then travelled to Bhatkal in North Canara, a port town on the coastal route from Thana to Quilon in 1328. About 1493, a cross was caught in the net by some fishermen off Mangalore. It was made of Olive wood, well finished and one span and a half in length, indicating the possibility of a Christian community in Mangalore. Some crosses painted black and red were discovered by the Portuguese in 1505 while digging up for laying the foundation for a fortress at Anjediva in North Canara. According to Paulo da Trinidade, they appeared to have belonged to a chapel or church of Christians. It is difficult to say whether these findings were Christian crosses or some other objects which looked like crosses and actually were instruments used by Hindus for astronomical observations. According to Historian Severine Silva, no concrete evidence has yet been found that there were any permanent settlements of Christians in South Canara before the 16th century. Even if it is assumed that Christianity existed in South Canara before the arrival of the Portuguese, the Christian community must have disappeared by 1498. Pedro √Ålvares Cabral converted 22 or 23 natives to Christianity in the Mangalore region in 1500 It was only after the advent of the Portuguese in the region that Christianity began to be propagated. In 1498, the Portuguese explorer Vasco Da Gama landed on a group of islands in South Canara on his voyage from Portugal to India. He named them El Padron de Santa Maria, which later came to be known as St Mary's Islands. In 1500, Pedro √Ålvares Cabral, a Portuguese explorer, arrived at Anjediva with eight Franciscan missionaries. These missionaries under the leadership of Henrique Soares de Coimbra converted 22 or 23 natives to Christianity in the Mangalore region. On 19 November 1502, some Christians of Mangalore and other interior places went with presents to meet Vasco da Gama, who was in Cochin. These Christian ambassadors told da Gama that they had their bishops and all of them said mass. They also told him that they undertook pilgrimages to the sepulcher of St. Thomas. Even prior to Alfonso de Albuquerque's conquest of Goa in 1510, the Portuguese had some settlements in Canara. It was easy for the Portuguese to send re-inforcements of missionaries to the existing stations in Canara and also to advance the work of evangelization. During the early part of the 16th century, Canara was ruled by Krishnadevaraya (1509‚Äì1529), the ruler of the Vijayanagara Empire of Deccan. As it was not possible for the Portuguese to enter Canara with Krishnadevaraya as ruler, a Portuguese alliance with Krishnadevaraya was the only way to enter Canara. Krishnadevaraya granted commercial privileges to the Portuguese on the Canara coast and there was complete freedom of worship, belief and propagation of religious tenets in the Vijaynagara Empire. In 1526, under the viceroyship of Lopo Vaz de Sampaio, the Portuguese took possession of Mangalore. During the rule of Lopo Vaz de Sampaio, a regular mission was established in Mangalore by some Franciscans who came from Goa, where they had been established in 1517. The Portuguese Franciscans slowly started spreading Christianity in Mangalore. On 31 January 1533, the Diocese of Goa was created by a bull of Pope Clement VII, and confirmed in 1534 by Pope Paul III by his bull Aequum Reputamus dated 3 November 1534. The Franciscan friar, Father John of Albuquerque, became the first Bishop of Goa in 1537. In 1534, Canara was placed under the ecclesiastic jurisdiction of the Bishop of Goa, where the Portuguese had a strong presence. Missionaries soon arrived and gained converts. The number of local converts in South Canara started increasing. During the mid-16th century, the Portuguese faced resistance from Abbakka Rani of Ullal, the Queen of the Bednore dynasty. The first battle between Abbakka Rani and the Portuguese was fought in 1546, where she emerged victorious, and succeeded in driving the Portuguese out of South Canara. Migrations from Goa Many of the Goan ancestors of the present Mangalorean Catholics fled Goa because of the Goa Inquisition introduced by the Portuguese in 1560. King Sebastian of Portugal decreed that every trace of Indian customs be eradicated through the Inquisition. The Inquisition characterized any vestige of Hinduism as heretical. Christian converts were banned from using Hindu names, attending any Hindu ceremonies including weddings, engaging the services of a Hindu doctor or midwife, wearing dhotis or cholis, and planting tulsi (Holy Basil). Those Christians who were not prepared to give up completely their former Hindu practices were declared heretics and apostates and could be condemned to death. But many Christians of Goa were attached to some of their ancient Indian customs, and refused to abandon them. Consequently, they lived in constant danger for their lives. Those who refused to comply with the rules laid down by the Inquisition were forced to leave Goa and to settle outside the Portuguese dominion. > It is interesting and instructive, in this light, to view the rituals and > practices of Mangalorean Catholics.

D'Souza, Popular Christianity: A Case Study among the Catholics of > Mangalore The Christians who left Goa were skilled cultivators who abandoned their irrigated fields in Goa to achieve freedom. At the time of migration, Canara was ruled by the Bednore King Shivappa Naik (1540‚Äì60). He evinced great interest in the development of agriculture in his empire and welcomed these farmers to his fertile lands. This was confirmed by Francis Buchanan, a Scottish physician, when he visited Canara in 1801. In his book, A Journey from Madras through the Countries of Mysore, Canara and Malabar (1807), he stated that \\"The princes of the house of Ikeri had given great encouragement to the Christians, and had induced 80,000 of them to settle in Tuluva.\\" Later, this was identified as a probable mistake and should have read \\"8,000\\". However even this figure included the second emigration of Christians from Goa. The Christians were also recruited into the armies of the Bednore dynasty. The Hindus left the Christians severely alone. The local Brahmins ignored the Christians, even those of Brahmin origin. On account of their change of religion, they refused to associate with them and did not admit them into their houses. Like the local Brahmins, the Bunts, who were largely self- sufficient in South Canara, also never associated with the Christians. A closer contact was, however, kept by the Christians with Goan Hindus of the same caste who were, like the Christians, refugees from Goa. The Christians used to invite their Hindu relatives to festivities such as birth celebrations, weddings and funeral feasts, and the Hindus used to accept such invitations. Under the provisional treaties between the Portuguese and the Bednore rulers, the Christians were allowed to build churches and help the growth of Christianity in South Canara. The arrival of the British and the Dutch halted the activity of the Portuguese and gradually the Portuguese were unable to send the required number of missionaries to Mangalore. In 1568, the Church of Nossa Senhora do Ros√°rio de Mangalore (Our Lady of the Rosary of Mangalore) was erected by the Portuguese at Bolar in Mangalore. The Churches of Nossa Senhora de Merc√™s de Velala (Our Lady of Mercy of Ullal) and S√£o Francisco de Assis Igreja (St. Francis of Assisi) at Farangipet were also erected by the Portuguese during the same time in South Canara. These three churches were highlighted by the Italian traveller Pietro Della Valle, who visited Mangalore in 1623. Milagres Church, one of the oldest churches in South Canara, was built in 1680. The Sultan of Bijapur attacked Goa in 1571 and ended Portuguese influence in the region. The Bijapur sultans were especially known for their loathing of Christianity. Fearing persecution, many Catholics from Goa migrated to South Canara. This migration is referred as the \\"Second Wave of Migration\\". The Milagres Church, one of the oldest churches in South Canara, was built in 1680 by Bishop Thomas de Castro, a Goan Catholic theatine priest who was appointed by Pope Clement X as the Vicar Apostolic of Canara. The attacks of the Maratha Empire on Goa, during the mid 16th century, was also a cause of migration. In 1664, Shivaji, the founder of the Maratha empire, attacked Kudal, a town north of Goa, and began his campaign for Goa. After Shivaji's death on 3 April 1680, his son Sambhaji ascended to the throne. The onslaught of Sambahji, along the northern territories of Goa drove nearly all the Christians from their homelands, and most of them migrated to South Canara. This migration is referred as the \\"Third Wave of Migration\\". From the Salcete district of Goa, according to one estimate, emigrations were around at the rate of 2,000 annually. From the Bardez district of Goa, Jesuit priests estimated that 12,000 Christians emigrated from Goa between 1710‚Äì1712, most of them going southward. A Goa Government report of 1747 presently in the Panjim archives recorded that around 5,000 Christians fled from the Bardez and Tiswadi districts of Goa during the invasion of the Marathas. It was estimated that during the Maratha raids on Goa, about 60,000 Christians migrated to South Canara. During the later years, the migration slowed because of the Maratha-Mughal wars, which kept Sambhaji busy, and some 10,000 Christians returned to Goa.

According to Alan Machado Prabhu, the Mangalorean Catholics numbered about 58,000 by 1765. Hyder Ali Hyder Ali occupied Mangalore in 1763. From 1766‚Äì1772, Hyder Ali took de facto control of the throne of the Mysore Kingdom through the Wodeyar dynasty. In February 1768, the English captured Mangalore from Hyder. The Portuguese had offered to help Hyder against the English. But when the Portuguese betrayed Hyder, he directed his anger towards the Mangalorean Catholics, who had been converted to Christianity by the Portuguese. Toward the end of 1768, Hyder defeated the English and captured Mangalore fort, where the Mangalorean Catholics were taking refuge. Around 15,675 of them were taken as prisoners to Mysore by Hyder. Only 204 returned; the rest died, were killed, or converted to Islam. After Hyder's death in the Second Anglo-Mysore War on December 1782, the British captured the fort again. Hyder was succeeded by his son Tippu Sultan. The Mangalorean Catholics helped the British in the fort by providing them rice, vegetables, and money. Tippu decided to come down heavily upon these Christians for providing aid to the British. On 20 May 1783, Tippu Sultan laid siege to the Mangalore fort, where the Mangalorean Catholics and English army were taking refuge. The fort was finally delivered to Tippu when the British capitulated it on 30 January 1784. More than 5,600 Mangalorean Catholics, who were condemned for treachery, were killed. Captivity at Seringapatam Jamalabad fort route. Mangalorean Catholics had traveled through this route on their way to Seringapatam The captivity of Mangalorean Catholics at Seringapatam, which began on 24 February 1784 and ended on 4 May 1799, remains the most disconsolate memory in their history. Soon after the Treaty of Mangalore in 1784, Tippu gained control of Canara. He issued orders to seize the Christians in Canara, confiscate their estates, and deport them to Seringapatam, the capital of his empire, through the Jamalabad fort route. The account of the number of captives differ ranging from 30000 to 80,000. According to Thomas Munro, a Scottish soldier and the first collector of Canara, around 60,000 of them, nearly 92 percent of the entire Christian community of Canara, were captured, only 7,000 escaped. Francis Buchanan gives the numbers as 70,000 captured, from a population of 80,000, with 10,000 escaping. They were forced to climb nearly through the dense jungles and gorges of the Western Ghat mountain ranges along the Kulshekar-Virajpet-Coorg- Mysore route. It was from Mangalore to Seringapatam, and the journey took six weeks. According to the Barkur Manuscript, written in Canarese by a Mangalorean Catholic from Barkur after his return from Seringapatam, 20,000 of them (one-third) died on the march to Seringapatam due to hunger, disease and ill treatment by the soldiers. Those who resisted were thrown down from the Jamalabad fort route. According to James Scurry, a British officer, who was held captive along with Mangalorean Catholics, 30,000 of them were captured. The young women and girls were forcibly made wives of the Muslims living there. The young men who offered resistance were disfigured by cutting their noses, upper lips, and ears and paraded in the city. According to Mr. Silva of Gangolim, a survivor of the captivity, if a person who had escaped from Seringapatam was found, the punishment under the orders of Tipu was the cutting off of the ears, nose, the feet and one hand.Account of a Surviving Captive, A Mr. Silva of Gangolim (Letter of a Mr. L.R. Silva to his sister, copy of which was given by an advocate, M.M. Shanbhag, to the author, Severino da Silva, and reproduced as Appendix No. 74: History of Christianity in Canara (1965)) British era (1799-1947) David Baird, a British officer, discovering the body of Tipu Sultan on 4 May 1799 In the Battle of Seringapatam on 4 May 1799, the British stormed the fortress, breached the town of Seringapatam, and killed Tippu. After his death in the Fourth Anglo- Mysore War, the Mangalorean Catholics were freed from his captivity. Of the 60,000-80,000 Mangalorean Catholics taken captive, only 15,000-20,000 made it out as Christians. After deliverance from captivity, while returning home to South Canara the King of Coorg offered the Mangalorean Catholics safe stay in their lands and many of them settled in Coorg. British general Arthur Wellesley helped 10,000 of them return to South Canara and resettle on their lands. According to the Mangalorean genealogist Michael Lobo, the present Mangalorean Catholic community is descended almost entirely from this small group of survivors. Later, the British took over South Canara. In 1800, they took a census of the region. Of the 396,672 people living in South Canara, 10,877 were Christians. Padre Jos√© Miguel Luis de Mendes, a Goan Catholic priest, was appointed Vicar of Our Lady of Rosary at Mangalore on 7 December 1799. He took a lot of interest in the re-establishment of the community from 1799 to 1808. Later, British general John Goldsborough Ravenshaw II was appointed collector of South Canara. He took active part in the re- establishment of their former possessions and recovery of their estates. He constructed a church for them, which was completed in 1806. Their population almost doubled in 1818. According to various parish books existing that time, Mangalorean Catholics numbered 19,068 in South Canara (12,877 in Mangalore and Bantwal, 3,918 in Moolki, 2,273 in Cundapore and Barcoor). Seventeen churches which were earlier destroyed by Tippu were rebuilt. After relocation, the community prospered under the British, and the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Goa commenced again. Regarding the Christians, Stokes mentioned, \\"They have raised themselves to a name unquestionably the most respectable in every situation in which they move in Kanara, whether as holding high public\\". The Mangalorean Catholics gradually prospered under the British. The St Aloysius Chapel in Mangalore, built by the Italian Jesuit Antonio Moscheni in 1884, during the Mangalore Mission (1878) The opening of the Protestant German Basel Mission of 1834 in Mangalore brought many handicraft and tile-manufacturing industries to the region and led to a large-scale rise in employment. In 1836‚Äì7, when the political situation in Portugal was in turmoil, Antonio Feliciano de Santa Rita Carvalho, a Portuguese priest, was appointed Archbishop-elect of Goa in September 1836 without authorization from the Pope. Many Mangalorean Catholics did not accept the leadership of Carvalho but instead submitted to the Vicar Apostolic of Verapoly in Travancore, while some of them continued to be under the jurisdiction of Goa. The parishes in South Canara were divided into two groups ‚Äî one under Goa and the other under Verapoly. Under the leadership of Joachim Pius Noronha, a Mangalorean Catholic priest, and John Joseph Saldanha, a Mangalorean Catholic judge, the Mangalorean Catholics sent a petition to the Holy See in 1840 to establish Mangalore as a separate Vicariate to ward off the differences. Conceding to their request, Pope Gregory XVI established Mangalore as a separate Vicariate on 17 February 1845 under the Verapoly Carmelites. The Mangalore Mission was then transferred to the French Carmelites by a Bull dated 3 January 1870. During the regime of Carmelites, the Mangalorean Catholics constantly sent memorandums to the Holy See to send Jesuits to Mangalore to start institutions for higher education, since the youth frequently had to go to Bombay and Madras for educational purposes. The Roman Catholic Church studied the situation and Pope Leo XIII by the Brief of 27 September 1878 handed over the Mangalore mission to the Italian Jesuit of Naples, who reached Mangalore on 31 December 1878. The Italian Jesuits played an important role in education, health, and social welfare of the community and built the St. Aloysius College in 1880, St Aloysius Chapel in 1884, and many other institutions and churches. On 25 January 1887, Pope Leo XIII established the Diocese of Mangalore, which is considered to be an important landmark in the community's history. In 1901, Mangalorean Catholics accounted for 76,000 of the total 84,103 Christians in South Canara., while in 1962, they numbered 186,741. During the mid-nineteenth century, Bishop Victor R. Fernandes, a Mangalorean Catholic priest, erected a large cross at former outskirts of Mangalore in Nanthoor near Padav hills to honour the memory of Mangalorean Catholic martyrs who died on the march and during their 15-year captivity at Seringapatam. During the later 20th century, they started migrating to other parts of India, especially Bombay and Bangalore. Till 1930 it was boom time when educated young Mangalorean Catholic men were drawn to Bombay from Mangalore in search of lucrative employment. The lower working class received no support from those of the upper class of their community in Bombay, Westernisation of habits and the rejection of the mother tongue was the reason for a sharp cleavage between the two classes. In 1930s, the profession taken up by the lower classes were as taxi drivers and fitters and as domestic service in homes. The men lived in koods mainly in Central and South Bombay. There were about 400 Mangalorean Catholics then in Bombay. The first Mangalorean Catholic to settle down in Madras in the 1940s was Dewan Bahadur Alexio Pinto. Independent India (1947-present) During the 1970s, coastal communication increased between Bombay and Mangalore, after introduction of ships by the London based trade firm Shepherd. These ships facilitated the entry of Mangalorean Catholics to Bombay. The bicentenary anniversary of the release from captivity was widely celebrated on 4 May 1999 by the Mangalorean Catholic community. Five Catholics walked from Seringapatam to Mangalore to retrace the 278 km route that Tippu Sultan forced the Christians to take in 1784. The commemorative march ended on 11 May at the Rosario Cathedral, Mangalore. Events related to Mangalorean Catholics that took place in Mangalore, and made national headlines were the attacks on Christian churches in September 2008.

They demanded money from the villagers, and took one of them, Peronne Goguillon, with them and accused her of being a witch. On 10 May, her husband Andrieu Dufosset complained about this, but the next day, Michel Fontenier, the landlord of one of the soldiers, confirmed that she was a witch, possibly in fear of the soldiers. Twenty witnesses were called to the trial. Peronne was accused of having violated the holy sacrament, visited the witch's sabbath, having met the devil in shape of a black dog called Fr√©quette, cast spells on children, women and cattle, performed an abortion, and killed children. Three marks were found upon her body. She was eventually made to confess that they were given her by the devil. She pointed out her cousin Jeanne Goguillon, Jeanne Bachy, Jean Bachy, Pierre Hornet and her daughter Marie-Anne Dufosset (age 18) as witches on 24 May. Two days later, she also identified Marie-Anne Ducrocquet, Andrieu Fischel, Philippote Fischel, and Madeleine Truan. On 28 May, Peronne was judged guilty of witchcraft and sentenced to death by burning. The sentence was carried out 29 May 1679. Jeanne Goguillon was burned 3 July 1679 after a mark was found on her body. Marie-Anne Dufosset was judged guilty on the same charges as her mother and burned. These are regarded as the last women to be executed for witchcraft in France; the last women were put on trial in 1748 and 1768, but sentenced to fines; however, the last person to be executed for sorcery in France was male, Louis Debaraz, who was executed in 1745.

Mangalorean Catholics are Roman Catholics from Mangalore and the former South Canara district on the southwestern coast of India. They are Konkani people and speak the Konkani language. Most of the ancestors of Mangalorean Catholics were Goan Catholics, who had migrated to South Canara from Goa, a state north of Canara, between 1560 and 1763 during the Goa Inquisition and the Portuguese-Maratha wars. The culture of Mangalorean Catholics is a blend of Mangalorean and Goan cultures. After migration, they adopted the local Mangalorean culture but retained many of their Goan customs and traditions. Non-vegetarian cuisine Sanna‚ÄìDukra Maas Their curry uses a lot of coconut and curry leaves while ginger, garlic and chilli are also used. Mangalorean Catholic cuisine has distinct Portuguese influence as can be seen in Laitao, the famous pork roast served as the Pi√®ce de r√©sistance at wedding dinners, and Pork Sorpotel. Fabled cooks like Davidam or Alicebai were called in to help with the repast. Mangalorean Catholics mix pork blood and other parts in most of their pork delicacies as can be seen from Pork Bafat, Cabidela and Kalleze un Kiti (heart and intestines). Sanna‚ÄìDukra Maas (Sanna ‚Äì idli fluffed with toddy or yeast; Dukra Maas ‚Äì Pork) and Unde‚ÄìDukra Maas (Unde ‚Äì leavened bread; Dukra Maas ‚Äì Pork) are popular dishes. Chicken Indaz is also popular. The traditional Rosachi kadi (Ros Curry), a fish curry made with ros (coconut milk) is quite popular and is served during the Ros (anointing) ceremony that is held 1 or 2 days before a Mangalorean Catholic wedding. Their fish curry especially their Fish Roe Curry, is known for its taste in the whole of coastal India while fried fish in their style is well known. The Sheveo Roce and Pathal Bakri (a variant of Kori Rotti) are dry rice flakes dipped in chicken gravy dishes. Alt URL Vegetarian cuisine Kuswar The \\"Balthazaar Chutney\\" is a popular condiment. The dish originated when Balthazaar, a Mangalorean Catholic nobleman, was taken prisoner by Tippu Sultan in 1784 during the Captivity of Mangalorean Catholics at Seringapatam. Unable to stomach the indifferent camp food, he offered to make a chutney for the captured Mangalorean Catholics. The Pollu, a type of Sambhar with Galmbi (powdered dried fish) or Kambulmas (Dried Tuna) is popular. The traditional Fode is a popular pickle. Thail Piao, which means literally vegetables dumped with oil and onions and left to boil on the fire wood is quite popular. Karamb (Cucumber salad) and Foka (Lady‚Äôs finger combined with cashewnuts). The Appam (rice balls) and Panpole (a type of pancake) are popular delicacies made of soaked rice, water and salt. The Thath Bakri is a banana leaf rice dish made with ground red boiled rice mixed with raw scraped coconut and roasted on a tava on a banana leaf. The Mitais, Mandas, Ushae, Pitae and Mani are well known sweet dishes. Kuswar Kuswar is a term often used to mention a set of unique Christmas goodies which are part of the cuisine of the Mangalorean Catholic community There are as many as 22 different traditional recipes that form this distinct flavour of Christmas celebration in Mangalore. Neuries are puffs stuffed with plums, nuts, and fried theel (sesame) and sugar. Kidyo or Kulkuls are curly concoctions dipped in sugar treacle, pathekas are savoury of green nandarkai bananas, theel laddus and jaw snapping Golios. Macaroons is what Manglore is famous for and the subtle flavored rose cookies are a hot favorite. But it is the Rich Plum Cake which takes the better part of a week to make. Candied fruit, plums, currents, raisins are dexterously cut and soaked in rum. Flour sieved and gently warmed in the sun. Nuts shelled and chopped and the whole family comes together to make the cake. Jobs are allotted, one to whip up the eggs, while another creams the butter and sugar, cake tins are lined, and a strong pair of arms requisitioned to do the final mixing and stirring. Patrode or Pathrade, a dish of colocasia leaves stuffed with rice, dal, jaggery, coconut, and spices is also popular. The Mangalorean Catholic version of this steamed delicacy is a slight variation on the Tuluva recipe. More spicy, it is fried in Meet Mirsang (salt and chilli), a red chilli masala, which is a popular condiment used to flavour Mangalorean Catholic dishes.

Emissions were estimated using methods from EPA's 1995 guidance document State Workbook: Methodologies for Estimating Greenhouse Gas Emissions. In 1990, Kentucky emitted 35.4 million metric tons of carbon equivalent (MMTCE). In addition, Kentucky estimated emissions of 0.4 MMTCE from biofuels. Emissions from biofuels are not included. The principal greenhouse gases were carbon dioxide, comprising 87.9 million metric tons (24.0 MMTCE), and methane, with 1.1 million metric tons (6.4 MMTCE). Other emissions included 0.0016 million metric tons of perfluorocarbons (PFCs) (4.8 MMTCE), and 0.003 million metric tons of nitrous oxide (0.2 MMTCE) The major source of carbon dioxide emissions was fossil fuel combustion (96%), the majority of which is utility coal. Minor emissions came from cement and lime production and forest/grassland conversion. Carbon dioxide sinks (i.e., an increase in forest carbon storage) offset about 26% of the total carbon dioxide emissions. Sources of methane emissions were coal mining (73%), domesticated animals (12%), landfills (10%), manure management (3%), and natural gas/oil extraction (2%). Nitrous oxide emissions were from fertilizer use. Sources of perfluorocarbons were HCFC-22 production (91%) and aluminum production (9%). Kentucky's emissions in 1990 were 9.6 MTCE per capita, compared to 1990 U.S. emissions of 6.4 MTCE per capita. Kentucky's per capita emissions are high due to the large volume of coal-related activities in the state.Randy Strait, Maureen Mullen, Bill Dougherty, Rachel Anderson, Andy Bollman, Viola Glenn, Juan Maldonado, Steve Roe, Jackson Schreiber, Brad Strode, Katie Pasko, Final Kentucky Greenhouse Gas Inventory and Reference Case Projections 1990-2030, Center for Climate Strategies, June 2010.  Coal- seam fires  A great deal of greenhouse gas emissions and toxic pollutants in Kentucky originate in coal-seam fires.

Carbon-dioxide storage  Carbon sequestration is the process of injecting carbon-dioxide into geological formations in order to store it and prevent it entering the atmosphere. Pumping carbon-dioxide into geological formations has been done in the oil industry for some time for the purpose of extracting oil. For this reason the technology is considered proven, at least as far as the physical pumping is concerned. Unmineable coal seams are one possible formation that could be used for this purpose. As of 2010, there are plans to conduct a feasibility study in conjunction with the Kentucky Geological Survey. The Kentucky Carbon Storage Foundation will drill the test well. The facility is intended to serve a coal gasification plant planned by Peabody Energy and ConocoPhillips.Julie Kerr Casper, Greenhouse Gases: Worldwide Impacts, pp. 49-51, Infobase Publishing, 2010 .

He is best known for his service in the South West Pacific Area during World War II, where he headed the Advance Base and the Combined Operations Service Command during the Kokoda Track campaign and the Battle of Buna-Gona. He later commanded the Advance Base at Lae and Finschhafen, and the Engineer School at Fort Belvoir. After the war he headed the Pacific Engineer Division, where he was responsible for a number of important flood control and irrigation projects. Education and early life Dwight Frederick Johns was born in Rockford, Illinois on 16 May 1894. He entered the United States Military Academy at West Point as an appointee from Illinois in 1912 and graduated sixth in the class of 1916. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army Corps of Engineers in June 1916. World War I Johns initially served at the United States Military Academy as an instructor in the Department of Tactics but in July 1916 he was posted to the 1st Battalion of Mounted Engineers on the Mexican Border. He served with the Pancho Villa Expedition from November 1916 to February 1917, when the 8th Engineers returned to El Paso, Texas. Johns was promoted to captain in May 1917 and major in May 1918. He commanded the 8th Engineers from April to August 1918. Returning to the United States Military Academy in August 1918, he became an instructor in Drawing from August to December 1918, and in Tactics from November to December 1918. From December 1918 to mid-1919 he was an instructor in Mathematics. Between the wars Like most officers in the aftermath of World War I, Johns was reduced in rank to his substantive rank of captain in August 1919, but was promoted to major again in February 1921. In June 1921 he entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, from which he graduated in June 1922 with a Bachelor of Science degree, majoring in civil engineering. He then became Assistant District Engineer of the Detroit River and Harbour District. In 1924 he was posted to the 11th Engineers, based in the Panama Canal Zone. He returned to the United States in 1927 to take up an appointment in the Office of the Chief of Engineers. From 1931 to 1933 he was a student at the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth. After graduating, he became District Engineer at St Paul, Minnesota. On 1 July 1937, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. He attended the U.S. Army War College from 1937 to 1938, then became at instructor at the Command and General Staff College. World War II In 1940 Johns became commanding officer of the 21st Engineers. The 21st Engineers were assigned the task of investigating techniques for the rapid construction of air bases. As such, Johns was involved in the development of a number of new construction techniques, most notably the use of Marston Mat. alt=Tall man wearing garrison hat and a pistol in a holster pins a medal on short man wearing steel helmet. His expertise in airbase construction led to Johns being sent to the South West Pacific as Chief Engineer, American Forces in Java. Departing Washington, D.C. by air on 14 January 1942, Johns arrived in Surabaya nine days later. His first mission was to provide airfield facilities on Java for 2,000 aircraft. Tapping into the vast resources of labour available in one of the world's most densely populated regions, Johns set about readying the required airfields. However, Java was captured by the Japanese before the aircraft arrived. Johns reached Australia on 28 February 1942 and became Chief Engineer, United States Army Forces in Australia (USAFIA), with the rank of brigadier general. As such, Johns represented the US Army on the Allied Works Council, the body controlling and coordinating all construction activities in Australia. With the arrival in Australia of General Douglas MacArthur, Brigadier General Hugh John Casey, who had accompanied MacArthur from the Philippines, became Chief Engineer at General Headquarters (GHQ), South West Pacific Area (SWPA). Johns, who was in an earlier class at West Point than Casey, remained Chief of Engineers, USAFIA until 25 May 1942, when he became Chief of Staff of US Army Services of Supply (USASOS). When the Kokoda Track campaign became mired in logistical difficulties, MacArthur and General Sir Thomas Blamey agreed to establish a Combined Operations Service Command (COSC) under New Guinea Force to co-ordinate logistical activities in Papua-New Guinea. Johns was designated commander of both COSC and the Advance Base, New Guinea on 8 October 1942. He was given an Australian deputy, Brigadier Victor Secombe, a Royal Australian Engineers officer. All Australian and American logistical units were placed under COSC but Johns chose to exercise command of the Australian units through Secombe. They built an organization that \\"was a radical departure from that which the Australian Army considered normal administrative procedure, but was adequately to meet the novel demands of a campaign in a country lacking roads and railways, in which all transport had to be by sea or air, and in which often the administrative or base areas coincided with the operational areas.\\" Johns later wrote that: alt=Six men in floppy hats shovel dirt. Two men wearing steel helmets and carrying pistols in holsters watch. Johns impressed Australian officers with his sensitive handling of inter-Allied issues, his co-operative nature, and his ability to get the job done. Lieutenant General Edmund Herring, who came to regard Johns as a close friend, later described Johns and Secombe as \\"born co-operators.\\"Letter, Sir Edmund Herring to D. Clayton James, 22 May 1972, State Library of Victoria MS11355, Box 37. One of Johns' most important decisions involved the construction of a new deep-water berth for Liberty ships at Tatana Island. This involved building a causeway out to the island. The project would double the capacity of the port of Port Moresby, but in order to build it Johns had to divert the African-American 96th Engineers from work on the airfields around Port Moresby, raising fears from airmen like Brigadier General Ennis Whitehead that the airfields would not be ready for all-weather operations by the time that the rainy season arrived. Rains in late October did indeed close three airfields but the causeway opened on 30 October and the wharf accepted its first ship on 3 November. Johns relinquished his roles in Papua and resumed his former post at USASOS in March 1943, being replaced by Brigadier General Hanford MacNider.Letter, MacArthur to Blamey, 22 March 1943, NAA (ACT): A2653/1 M56/1943 In turn, he replaced MacNider as GHQ Coordinator, Milne Bay in October 1943. As such, he was responsible for all logistical activities at what was now the major US base in Papua-New Guinea.GHQ SWPA, \\"Coordinater Milne Bay Area\\", 16 October 1943, AWM52 1/2/6 On 15 December 1943, he became Coordinator, Finschhafen. Finschhafen was destined to become the new hub of US activity in Papua-New Guinea; but an enormous amount of work was required to get the base ready for action. For his service in New Guinea, Johns was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal. In 1944, Johns became commandant of the Engineer School at Fort Belvoir. The wartime Engineer School was responsible for the training of officers. Some were engineers in civilian life who were trained as officers; other were officers transferred from other arms who were given training in engineering subjects. The Officer Candidate School (OCS) prepared enlisted men for commissioning as officers. There had been strong criticism of the content of training courses from SWPA, where it was the norm for machinery to be operated around the clock and for engineer officers to supervise all manner of construction tasks. The commanders there felt that the training courses taught by the Engineer School were concentrating too much on leadership in combat, and not enough on technical matters, such the operation and maintenance of construction equipment. Johns reformed the curriculum, but by this time it was too late for the changes to have much effect in the overseas theaters of operations. For his work at Fort Belvoir, Johns was awarded the Legion of Merit. Later life Johns was Assistant Chief of Engineers for Military Operations from June 1945 to March 1947. He reverted to his permanent rank of colonel in March 1946. In June 1947 Johns became commander of the Pacific Engineer Division, based in San Francisco, responsible for the southern half of the Pacific coast. As such he was involved with a number of important construction projects, including the Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel, the Folsom Dam, the Isabella Dam, the Pine Flat Lake, and the Merced River projects. Johns retired from the army as a brigadier general on 31 December 1949. In retirement, Johns was awarded the Gold Medal from the Society of American Military Engineers in 1950, and served as its president in 1953. Johns maintained the wartime friendships he had made, and with his wife Laura he entertained Australian general Sir Edmund Herring in their home in Piedmont, California in 1967. Johns died on 8 November 1977.

Career Early career PƒÉtulea was born in T√¢rgovi≈üte. He played for Rapid Bucharest, Astra Ploie≈üti and Petrolul Ploie≈üti in his native Romania. He spent some time in Dubai with Al Hamriya where he linked up with his former Astra coach Petre Gigiu, before moving to the UK. Lincoln City In February 2008 he trained with Burgess Hill Town, but problems with his international clearance curtailed any move. He began the 2008-09 pre-season with Boston United, playing in their 2-0 friendly victory at Shirebrook Town on 12 July 2008. He then arrived at Lincoln City and requested a trial. City manager Peter Jackson's resistance was broken by the player's bizarre training ground routine and Patulea then spent six weeks training with the first team squad. Jackson later commented, \\"He (PƒÉtulea) was spotted by the groundsman running around the training ground with his girlfriend on his back. The trouble is his girlfriend was naked, which got the attention of the players\\".http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/lincoln_city/7517384.stm During this time, he scored a second-half hat-trick against local rivals Lincoln United and appeared to have won the hearts of Lincoln supporters. It then became apparent that Patulea's former club, Petrolul Ploie≈üti, held his registration and his switch to Sincil Bank looked to be over when his parent club demanded a large fee from City. City eventually managed to negotiate a deal for Patulea, and he signed for the club on 29 August 2008. His international clearance documents did not come through in time for him to play in the derby with Grimsby Town, but he scored his first League goal on his debut for Lincoln City, coming off the bench to score a goal in the Imps' 2‚Äì0 win over Barnet. PƒÉtulea then went on to make his second appearance from the bench in the Lincoln's away defeat against Bury, before he started his first game of the season away at Brentford, taking just 30 minutes to notch his second goal in a City shirt. PƒÉtulea then scored again in the 57th minute in the 2‚Äì0 win over Chester. He yet again found the net in the 30th minute against Chesterfield in Lincoln's 3‚Äì1 win over Chesterfield. He then came off the bench to score two goals in Lincoln's 5‚Äì1 win at Sincil Bank against Accrington Stanley. He then scored the winner in Lincoln's 1‚Äì0 win over Notts County in the 32nd minute. Leyton Orient & Hereford United On 23 June 2009, he signed for Leyton Orient on a two-year deal. He scored his first goal for Orient in a League Cup tie at Colchester United on 11 August 2009. In September 2010, under new Orient manager Russell Slade, Patulea went on loan to Conference National club Hayes & Yeading United. He made his debut for United in the 3‚Äì1 defeat at Kidderminster Harriers, scoring their goal but later receiving a red card for violent conduct. When he returned to Orient, he was unable to cement a place in the first team and on 22 January, his contract was terminated by mutual consent. He signed for Hereford United on 7 March in a deal that ran until the end of the season. This contract was not extended after Patulea struggled to make an impact with the Bulls. Farul Constan≈£a In August 2011 PƒÉtulea returned to his home country to sign with Liga II team FC Farul Constan≈£a. He impressed here, scoring 15 goals from 27 games, and attracted attention from bigger clubs. CSMS Ia»ôi In August 2012 he joined Liga I club CSMS Ia»ôi on a two-year contract. His last game for Farul Constan≈£a was against Ia»ôi, where PƒÉtulea scored two goals in an eventual 4‚Äì2 loss. He scored his first goal for CSMS on 10 August, in a game against Petrolul Ploie»ôti. He tied the score at 2‚Äì2 in a dramatic manner, by scoring in the last minute of extra time. Rapid Bucharest and FC Vaslui On 30 July 2013, Adrian Patulea signed with his old club Rapid Bucharesthttp://www.fotbal-romania.ro/exclusiv-adrian-patulea-la-rapid-pentru- un-sezon.html for 1 season, following CSMS Iasi's relegation. However, after TAS's decision to relegate Rapid Bucharest because of financial problems, he terminated his contract with the Bucharest club. He did not play a match for Rapid.

Sibford Gower parish includes the village of Burdrop. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 508. Much of the village is a conservation area.Design and Conservation Team Strategic Planning and the Economy. ‚ÄúSibford Ferris, Sibford Gower and Burdrop Conservation Area Appraisal.‚Äù Thesibfords.uk, Cherwell, 2012, https://thesibfords.uk/sib2/wp- content/uploads/2019/02/SIbford_Ferris__Gower___Burdrop_CA_Appraisal_2012.pdf. Manors The Domesday Book of 1086 records two Norman-held manors at Sibford Gower. In 1086 William, son of Corbicion held 10 hides there, which was assessed as one knight's fee. By 1122 Henry de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Warwick held this manor. The last known reference to its feudal overlordship was under Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick in 1458. By 1190 the feoffee of the Beaumont manor was a Norman, William Goher. In the 1220s the family seem to have rebelled against the Crown and forfeited their lands, but by 1242‚Äì43 Thomas Goher had recovered the estate. The \\"Gower\\" part of the village's toponym is derived from a variant of \\"Goher\\". The other manor was of 11 hides and was held by Hugh de Grandmesnil. His son Ivo de Grandmesnil mortgaged the family estates to Robert de Beaumont, Count of Meulan in 1102. Ivo died that same year, and the Crown allowed de Beaumont to keep the Grandmesnil estates. In 1204 Robert de Beaumont, 4th Earl of Leicester died childless, leaving Sibford Gower to his younger sister Margaret, wife of Saer de Quincy. When their son Roger de Quincy, 2nd Earl of Winchester died in 1264 Sibford Gower passed to his eldest daughter Ellen or Helen, wife of Alan la Zouche. She left it to their grandson Alan la Zouche, 1st Baron la Zouche of Ashby, who left it to his daughter Maud, wife of Robert de Holland, 1st Baron Holand. In 1328 Holand was executed for treason, but his family kept the manor and it passed to his son Thomas Holland, 1st Earl of Kent. He left it to his niece Maud, wife of John Lovel, 5th Baron Lovel, who held the manor in 1374. It descended with his heirs until John Lovel, 8th Baron Lovel, who died in 1465. No subsequent records of the overlordship of this manor are known. His son Francis Lovell, 1st Viscount Lovell supported Richard III in the Wars of the Roses and fought at the Battle of Bosworth Field. Lovell survived Richard's defeat but Henry VII ordered the forfeiture of all his titles. Sibford Gower Manor House In about 1225 William of Wheatfield, feoffee of the de Quincy manor, granted land in Sibford Gower to the Knights Templar, who had held land in neighbouring Sibford Ferris since the middle of the 12th century. Slightly later the elder Alan la Zouche also granted land to them. In 1314, when the last of the Knights Templar in England were suppressed, their estate at Sibford Gower was 10 yardlands and was assessed as of a knight's fee. Sibford Gower Manor House was built in the 17th century. Frank Lascelles, who grew up in the village, had it substantially remodelled between 1907 and 1915. Until 1773 Sibford Gower had a single open field of 80 yardlands. In 1774 the inclosure award for Sibford Gower divided between 48 landholders. The largest award was to New College, Oxford, which had held the rectory of Swalcliffe since 1389 and over the years had extended its estates into Sibford Gower. Meeting-house, chapel and church A Quaker congregation was established in the village by 1669, when it met in the home of the clockmaker Thomas Gilkes. In 1678 or 1681 a Quaker meeting-house was built on land bought for the purpose by Bray D'Oyley, Thomas Fardon and Thomas Gilkes. By 1682 it had a burial ground. In 1736 a gallery was added inside the meeting-house to accommodate its growing congregation. The 1851 Census recorded that 112 people attended its Sunday meeting. In 1865 the old meeting-house was replaced with the present one southwest of the village, on the road to Hook Norton. Sibford Gower had a Wesleyan congregation by the first decade of the 19th century, for which a chapel was built in 1827. The 1851 Census recorded that it held two Sunday services, with congregations of 95 and 112. It became part of the Methodist Union in 1932 and was a member of the Chipping Norton and Stow-on- the-Wold Circuit. It was refurbished in 1962‚Äì63 and closed in June 2014. Sibford Gower was part of the Church of England parish of Swalcliffe until 1841, when a new ecclesiastical parish of Sibford Gower, with Sibford Ferris and Burdrop was created. The Church of England parish church of the Holy Trinity in Burdrop was built in 1840 to serve the new parish. Clockmakers Sibford Gower became associated with clockmaking in the 17th century. Thomas Gilkes was born in Sibford Gower in about 1665 and pioneered clockmaking in north Oxfordshire. There is no known record of where he learnt his trade, but as he was a Quaker he would have been apprenticed to a fellow Quaker; possibly Richard Gilkes of the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers in London. Thomas Gilkes died in 1743. Thomas Gilkes trained two of his sons as clockmakers: a third Thomas (1704‚Äì57), who then worked in Charlbury as both a clockmaker and a Quaker minister, and Richard (1715‚Äì87) who established his business in West Adderbury. John Fardon (1700‚Äì43) of Deddington also served his apprenticeship with the elder Thomas Gilkes in Sibford. Gilkes pioneered a clockmaking industry in north Oxfordshire villages with such success that his fellow- Quakers, including several further members of the Gilkes and Fardon families, dominated the trade in parts of the district for the next 150 years. Later clockmakers in Sibford Gower were also Quakers. John Wells' date of birth is unknown but he was married in the Friends' Meeting House in 1785. He moved his business to Shipston-on-Stour in Warwickshire, and he died in 1809. Ezra Enock or Enoch (1799‚Äì1860) was born in Sibford Gower. From 1827 he traded in Whitechapel in East London, but in 1832 he returned to Sibford Gower where he remained for the rest of his life. His son John Enock (1834‚Äì83) traded as a clock repairer in adjoining villages. Amenities Sibford Gower had a school by 1612 and its first schoolroom was built in 1623. A new cottage for the schoolmaster was built in 1818. In 1825 the school had 59 pupils, but this declined to 40 in 1833. The vicar of Swalcliffe complained in 1837 that the charity was mismanaged, its buildings were ruinous and the master and his wife were not competent. In 1866 the buildings were replaced with a new school and master's house. Pupil numbers recovered to 56 in 1871 and 68 in 1890. Quakers and Wesleyans in the parish held a public meeting in 1891 at which they objected to the school being classified as Church of England. The Charity Commissioners agreed that there was no specific requirement for its pupils to be taught in accordance with the Church of England. The school was enlarged and in 1903 could accommodate 139 pupils, but actual attendance averaged 81. It was enlarged again in 1960 and is now an Endowed Primary School.Sibford Gower Endowed Primary School In 1782 Sibford Gower had only one pub, the King's Arms. The Wykham Arms was licensed as an ale-house by 1793. It was built in the 17th century, possibly as a farmhouse.

In 1595, a great scandal occurred among the monks at an Abbey at Stavelot in the Ardennes. The monk Jean Delvaux claimed, that at the age of fifteen, he met a man in the woods who promised him riches if he followed him, which he had done, and he had given him two marks on his shoulders. He told him to become a monk at Stavelot, and promised that he would become an abbot. He had become a monk, and discovered many magicians among priests and monks. He said, that they were nine convents of wizards in the Ardennes, who gathered on the nights with demons to eat, dance and have sex. Delvaux was arrested by the order of the Prince Bishop of Li√©ge. An investigation was made. On the way to Stavelot, the carriage of the commission broke down, and Delvaux claimed that a demon had destroyed it. Delvaux was accused of being insane. Until the 10 January 1597, many people were questioned in connection to his accusations, both men and women from the public as well as people from the church. He was tortured and then turned over to the secular authorities. He was judged guilty, with the use of the Bible passage Exodus 22:18, and sentenced to death. As he was remorseful and asked for mercy, he was executed through decapitation and not by burning.

He was the only person to be awarded the Distinguished Flying Medal three times. During an operational career of some 300 operations, Kingaby scored 21 air victories against enemy aircraft, as well as two shared victories, six probables and 11 damaged during the war. 14 of his solo victories came against the Messerschmitt Bf 109. Early life Kingaby was born in Holloway, London, on 7 January 1920, the son of clergyman. Before the war he worked for an insurance company. RAF career Kingaby joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve in April 1939 when 19 years old. In June 1940, as a sergeant pilot, he joined No. 266 Squadron flying the Supermarine Spitfire Mark I. During the initial stages of the Battle of Britain he damaged two Junkers Ju 88 bombers and a Bf 110 fighter before being transferred to No. 92 Squadron, in September 1940. A Bf 109 of 4./JG 26 was claimed on 30 September, while Kingaby claimed four enemy aircraft, (three Bf 109s) in the second half of October. In November he shot down six Bf 109s, four of them (including 1 'probable') in a single day on 15 November. During 1941 RAF Fighter Command went onto the offensive with its fighter sweeps over occupied Europe. With 92 Squadron, Kingaby claimed a dozen more kills and was dubbed by the press the \\"109 specialist\\". On 22 November 1941, he was granted an emergency commission as a pilot officer (probationary), and rested from operations. In March 1942 he was back on operations with No. 111 Squadron. That April, Kingaby joined No. 64 Squadron, with which he shot down another couple of German fighters. He was promoted to the war-substantive rank of flying officer on 30 June. Later in the year Kingaby was posted to No. 122 Squadron as flight commander and then squadron commander. On 20 January 1943 Kingaby shot down Unteroffizier Helmut Peters of 6 Staffel Jagdgeschwader 26 (JG 26), who was killed in action. On 2 February, he was promoted to flight lieutenant (war-substantive). In March, he was promoted to lead the \\"Hornchurch Wing\\". After a rest period at Fighter Command HQ he was back as a wing leader in the summer of 1944 over the invasion beaches of France. His last kill was a share in a Bf 109 on 30 June, bringing his total to 21. On 24 July, he was promoted to the rank of squadron leader (war substantive), and was posted to the Advanced Gunnery School at RAF Catfoss, remaining there until the end of the war. An acting wing commander at the war's end, Kingaby was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross from the United States Government on 15 May 1945, and the Croix de guerre from Belgium on 15 June. After the war, Kingaby was granted a permanent commission as a flight lieutenant in the RAF on 29 November 1946, with seniority from 1 September 1945, but retained his war substantive rank of squadron leader until 1 January 1948, then spent a year as a flight lieutenant before being promoted to the permanent rank of squadron leader on 1 January 1949. From February 1949 until April 1952 he commanded No. 72 Squadron, flying the de Havilland Vampire. On 5 June 1952 he was awarded the Air Force Cross. Later life He served in the RAF until his retirement on 29 September 1958, retaining the rank of wing commander.

The Commission held it was not reasonable for the agency to rely on alternatives such as telephone information lines or an assumption the respondent could have the materials read to him by another. The Commission also held that the cost of providing materials in braille should be considered in the context of an agency's overall budget rather than an assessed cost-benefit of the number of potential users of that material. Background to the case Bruce Lindsay Maguire (b 1957) a small business owner from Baulkham Hills, New South Wales, was born totally blind and without sight or light perception. On 31 May 1999 Maguire sought to purchase tickets for himself and his family for the Sydney Olympic Games. At the time tickets were only available via an application form in a ticket book issued by the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG). Maguire initially tried to have the ticket book read aloud to him by his sister, but the level of detail and cross-referencing required in this process was onerous and the attempt was abandoned after several hours. Maguire then enquired about obtaining a braille version of the ticket book. SOCOG indicated a braille version would be published but this did not occur. On 7 June 1999 Maguire was contacted by SOCOG to advise that the book would not be printed in braille as the cost was considered too high given the likely small number of braille-literate users., Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Website, 17 December 2007, Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, last visited on Friday 29 August 2008, 4pm EST, \\"http://www.humanrights.gov.au/disability_rights/decisions/comdec/1999/DD000150.htm\\". Maguire then lodged a complaint with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, alleging direct discrimination against him personally, and indirect discrimination against those with vision impairment. The specific grounds for the complaint were: * failure to provide braille copies of the information required to place orders for Olympic Games tickets; * failure to provide braille copies of the Olympic Games souvenir programme; and * failure to provide a web site accessible to Maguire. In September 1999 this third ground for complaint was separated from the others and formed the basis for the standalone decision in Maguire v SOCOG 2000 Prior to the matter being heard, SOCOG instituted a telephone helpline for ticketing enquiries by the visually impaired. Arguments Jurisdiction of HREOC SOCOG initially objected to the Commission hearing the complaint on jurisdictional grounds. SOCOG argued it was a government agency and not a trading corporation and therefore not captured by section 12 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992. Instead, SOCOG argued the complaint should be heard by State disability tribunals. On 24 September 1999 SOCOG withdrew its objection to the complaint being heard but indicated it may renew it should the matter proceed to the Federal Court. Commissioner William Carter maintained the Commission was competent to hear the complaint but was not required to formally rule on the objection as it was withdrawn prior to hearing. Direct discrimination In failing to provide the ticket book in braille, the Commissioner found that SOCOG breached section 24 of the Act., DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION ACT 1992 - SECT 24 Goods, services and facilities, 25 August 2008, Australasian Legal Information Institute, last visited on Friday 29 August 2008, 6:43pm, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/dda1992264/s24.html SOCOG argued that the delivery of the information in the ticket book did not constitute the provision of services within the meaning of section 24. The Commissioner did not accept that argument as the services provided by SOCOG fell inside the definition stated in section 4,, DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION ACT 1992 - SECT 4 Interpretation, 25 August 2008, Australasian Legal Information Institute, last visited on Friday 29 August 2008, 6:48pm, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/dda1992264/s4.html . in which SOCOG was providing tickets to sessions at the 2000 Olympics where SOCOG cannot refuse as the terms of conditions for the tickets was the same for Maguire as for any sighted person and that the ticketing process was integral to gaining a ticket to attend and to enjoy the entertainment provided by SOCOG. In providing the ticket book in print and not in braille meant that Maguire was denied access to the ticket book, the consequential services provided by SOCOG and accordingly, Maguire was denied the opportunity to make a valid application for tickets to the Olympic games. Less favourable treatment The commissioner felt that unless Maguire could have access to the information in order to make a valid application, he was treated less favourably because of his blindness than a sighted person. SOCOG contested the charge of less favourable treatment by outlining that Maguire could have got a sighted person to read the document for him, and that Maguire had access to a phone helpline and to an electronic format of the booklet. The commissioner dismissed those arguments. Reading the booklet to Maguire would have meant an incomprehensible oral presentation of tabulations, a great feat of memory, a requirement to find a time of convenience and hours of explanations was considered by the commissioner to be treating Maguire less favourably than the sighted person who could access the material without assistance at his or her leisure, capable of referencing and cross-referencing from page to page and thereby ensuring the completion not only of a valid application complete with alternatives that reflected in all respect the final decided choices of That person. The commission raises the question as to how a person in the position of Maguire could acquire any primary information in the ticket book which could then be perfected or developed by the officer in the course of a telephone conversation. The dilemma indicated by the commissioner was that if the ticket book was produced in braille, Maguire would have not required the assistance of the helpline. The vital information in the ticket book was presented in tabular form in which the line of information scrolled off the right-hand edge of the screen, making it difficult for Maguire to comprehend when the material was presented in Braille form on the refreshable braille pad. Unjustifiable hardship SOCOG argued that the provision of the ticket book in braille was an unjustifiable hardship under section 24 (2). Using Section 24 and section 11 of DDA 1992,, DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION ACT 1992 - SECT 11 Unjustifiable hardship, 25 August 2008, Australasian Legal Information Institute, last visited on Friday 29 August 2008, 6:43pm, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/dda1992264/s11.html. the commissioner found that despite the small proportion of blind persons in the community who use Braille, SOCOG had the financial capacity to bear the additional cost as the cost of 200 braille copies of the ticket book would be $17,250.00 in comparison to the ticket book printing and distribution expenditure noted in SOCOG's budget which was $7.18 million. Indirect discrimination The commissioner found that SOCOG in not providing the ticket book in braille treated Maguire less favourably than persons without the disability which is also a breach of section 6., DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION ACT 1992 - SECT 6 Indirect disability discrimination, 25 August 2008, Australasian Legal Information Institute, last visited on Friday 29 August 2008, 8:35pm, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/dda1992264/s6.html Decision After finding in favour of Maguire, under section 103(1)(b)(ii) of the act, the commissioner made a declaration that SOCOG provide to Maguire forthwith the second booklet and that prior to 8 October, that SOCOG consult and inform Maguire as best it can of the classes and sessions for which tickets remain available and assist him in making a valid application for the remaining tickets by 8 October 1999. Consequently, the commissioner made a further declaration that, if Maguire desire to engage in the final ticketing process and SOCOG is unable to provide Maguire with the third booklet in Braille by 23 October, SOCOG again consult with Maguire and inform and assist him in the same manner as described in the second declaration above.

Eventually, it became a commemoration for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. The coach was used for the first time at the State Opening of Parliament on 4 June 2014. It has been in regular service since, often used for state visits, and is housed in the Royal Mews along with the other state coaches. Background In use at the 2014 State Opening of Parliament, postillion-driven with 3 pairs of Windsor Grey horses. The carriage was built in Australia by coachbuilder W. J. Frecklington, previously responsible for constructing the 1988 Australian State Coach. Although completed in 2010, the coach did not arrive in London until March 2014 due to issues with funding its transportation. Buckingham Palace stated that Frecklington had completed the coach of his own initiative and that it was not an official royal coach, although Frecklington stated that the coach was endorsed (but not commissioned) by Buckingham Palace. The coach was subsequently purchased by the Royal Collection Trust for an undisclosed sum, from a private donation, and is now part of the Royal Collection and can be officially put to use. Frecklington's intention was to create a coach that would encapsulate the history and heritage of the United Kingdom by incorporating material from Britain‚Äôs historic buildings, ships and other artifacts. The Diamond Jubilee State Coach is therefore an especially wide- ranging representation of the great events, figures and objects of British history ever assembled, items directly related to more than 30 kings and queens of England, Scotland and Ireland, the most influential characters in British history, her greatest victories, her most treasured places, and her greatest contributions to the world.

Hargrave was born to Joshua Hargrave and Sarah Hargrave (n√©e Lee) on 1 February 1817 at Greenwich, England. His father was a hardware merchant. He arrived in Sydney in 1838 on board the Argyle and went to work on Combelong Station at Monaro for Messrs Hughes and Hosking. The following year he became a partner of the Callendoon Station and the Goondiwini Stations on the Macintyre River. He founded Beeboo and Whylm on the Severn River. In 1843, he lost everything along with his partners following the financial collapse of the New South Wales economy in that year. His merchant father refinanced Hargrave and he was able to purchase at Armidale which he named \\"Hillgrove Station\\". He also acquired leases for Bostobrick and Tyringham and Hernani in New England. He was said to be involved in much conflict with the local Aboriginal population. He married Mary William on 16 February 1847 at Sydney. They had six sons and one daughter. Was a member for New England and Macleay from 17 April 1856 to 19 December 1857 in the first New South Wales Legislative Assembly.

Zlatiya is a low asymmetrical plateau in the northwestern part of the country, a subregion of the Danubian Plain. It lies between three rivers: the Tsibritsa to the west, the Ogosta to the east and the Danube to the north. The plateau's elevation is around 100‚Äì150 metres above mean sea level, the highest point reaching 176 m near the Danube. The soil is a fertile chernozem; no rivers cross the plateau, but by heavy rainfall the ravines are drained away to the east by the Ogosta river and ultimately into the Danube. Zlatiya has been an Important Bird Area since 2005 (parts of it since 1997) and has been included in the EU's Natura 2000 ecological network. The protected area covers 434.987 square kilometres. Although most of the region is composed of arable land, there are still some extant small forests. The main local product has traditionally been grain, leading to Zlatiya's labeling as \\"Bulgaria's northwestern granary\\", a comparison to Dobruja. The population mainly consists of Bulgarians, although there is a sizable Roma minority. A local centre is the town of Valchedram, Montana Province. The region's name roughly means \\"golden land\\".

He served as Rapportf√ºhrer at the Auschwitz concentration camp. Biography The son of a blacksmith, Kaduk was born in K√∂nigsh√ºtte, Upper Silesia. After attending the Volksschule he trained as a butcher before becoming one in 1924. As well as working at the local slaughterhouse, Kaduk also held positions with fire fighting services at the municipal fire brigade in Chorz√≥w and at a chemical plant. World War II In 1939 he joined the Allgemeine SS and in 1940 he was drafted into the Waffen-SS. He was sent to the Eastern Front, but due to various illnesses and stays at military hospitals he was posted to Auschwitz in 1941. At first he was assigned to watch tower duties in 1942, then became Blockf√ºhrer and finally Rapportf√ºhrer. One prisoner reported that he had a weakness for schnapps. Kaduk was considered \\"one of the cruelest, brutalest, most vulgar\\" of SS men at Auschwitz: Historian Andrew Roberts in his book The Storm of War recounted Kaduk's practice of handing Jewish children balloons just before they were murdered with a phenol injection to the heart at a rate of ten children per minute.National Review 6/20/11, pg. 53 Kaduk witnessed the mass murder of people in gas chambers, and describing his SS colleagues inserting the Zyklon B gas, he said: Kaduk is also known for Kaduk's chapel, a tiny tower between the barracks and the main camp of Auschwitz. Criminal convictions After Germany's surrender, Kaduk worked in a sugar factory in L√∂bau. In December 1946 he was recognized by a former prisoner and consequently arrested by a Soviet military patrol. In 1947, a Soviet military tribunal sentenced him to 25 years hard labour, but he was released in April 1956. Kaduk then went to West Berlin, working at a hospital as a nurse. Despite his violent reputation at Auschwitz, he earned himself the nickname \\"Papa Kaduk\\" among patients. In July 1959 Kaduk was again arrested and appeared in the Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials where he was one of the main accused. On 19 August 1965 the court sentenced him to life imprisonment for murder in ten cases, and joint murder in at least one thousand cases. Because of the gravity of Kaduk's deeds, the responsible Spruchkammern rejected various pleas for clemency. While in prison, Kaduk was interviewed as part of a TV documentary about SS men stationed at Auschwitz. When asked about Holocaust denial, Kaduk says: After the 1984 transfer to open prison (Offener Vollzug), Kaduk was released from the Schwalmstadt prison in 1989 due to health reasons (Haftunf√§higkeit). He died in Langelsheim, Harz, as a pensioner in 1997, at the age of 90.

History English-Konkani dictionary (2001 reprint) Mangalorean Catholics have immensely contributed towards Media Activities in Mangalore, Bombay and other cities in India. The Konkani Dirvem was the first Konkani language periodical to be published in Mangalore in 1912. The founder-editor of Konkani Dirvem was the great poet Louis Mascarenhas. After the Konknni Dirvem, came Raknno weekly in 1938 as an organ of the Diocese of Mangalore. A succession of brilliant priest-editors beginning with Sylvester Menezes, Alexander D‚ÄôSouza, Mark Waldar, Vincent Menezes, Samuel Sequeira and the current editor Eric Crasta has transformed Raknno as a literary medium and in the process bringing countless writers into the limelight. G.M.B. Rodrigues was the first Mangalorean to start a Konkani Weekly Sukh-Dukh in Bombay in 1948. In 1949, George Fernandes brought out a monthly Konknni Yuvak. Other periodicals of those times were Amchi Mai, Sevak, Ange, Jezu Rai, Kala Kiran, Samajicho Divo, Samajichem Ful, Prakas, Uzvad, Amchem Konkan, Maiganv, Bhingari, Dublleancho Bhav, Sant Ritachi Vordi, Catholic Yuvak etc. Poinnari, a Weekly, was started in Bombay in 1950 and its first editor was the well-known novelist V.J.P. Saldanha. Later on, the famous poet and dramatist Cha. Fra. D'costa became its editor. Felix Noronha is a renowned Konkani writer, who wrote the words for the Konkani hymn Dulob Jezu that was set to the tune of the English hymn 'What a Friend we have in Jesus'. The well-known novelist and writer J.S. Alvares brought out Mithr, a Weekly in 1953 and Jhelo a Fortnightly in 1956 in Bombay. A.A. Saldanha, J.B. Moraes and V.M. Fernandes experimented on the model of Reader's Digest by bringing out a monthly Konkani journal titled Konkan Daiz in 1958. Cha. Fra. D'Costa started periodicals like Zaag-maag, Vishal Konkan, Jivit and Udev one after the other. Kannik a fortnightly from Mangalore was one more periodical started by a Mangalorean Catholic Raymond Miranda in 1965. Since 1994, the Catholic Sabha of Mangalore is bringing out Amcho Sandesh a monthly, as its organ. Amar Konkani a half-yearly research oriented journal was started in Mangalore in 1980 by the Konkani Institute of the St. Aloysius College.

It is found in Europe and has been introduced into North America. Description Feeding signs of a larva The wingspan is 14‚Äì16 mm. Unlike a typical moth, which has two pairs of scaly wings, Alucita has about twenty thin feathery plumes (with scales on the supporting ribs). It perches with the wings outspread like a fan. The wings have a bold zigzag pattern in white, black and brown, which together with the shiny backward- pointing hairs on each plume make the adult moth distinctive. It is also popularly known as the many-plumed moth, while the specific name hexadactyla comes from the Greek for six-fingered. Single brooded, it can be found at any time of the year. It is common and often found in gardens, but is readily overlooked because of its small size. The larvae feed on honeysuckle (Lonicera species) tunnelling in the flower buds and leaves. Holes and darkening of the buds indicate larval feeding. There is disagreement as to whether the larvae are leaf miners or gall causers.

The doubling‚Äîand sometimes even tripling‚Äîoften originates in the transition from use of one language for legal purposes to another: in Britain, from a native English term to a Latin or Law French term; in Romance-speaking countries, from Latin to the vernacular. To ensure understanding, the terms from both languages were used. This reflected the interactions between Germanic and Roman law following the decline of the Roman Empire. These phrases are often pleonasms and form irreversible binomials. In other cases, the two components have differences which are subtle, appreciable only to lawyers, or obsolete. For example, ways and means, referring to methods and resources respectively, are differentiable, in the same way that tools and materials, or equipment and funds, are differentiable‚Äîbut the difference between them is often practically irrelevant to the contexts in which the irreversible binomial ways and means is used today in non-legal contexts as a mere clich√©.

Life Hugh McLaughlin was born in Brooklyn as son of Irish immigrants. He learned the trade of a rope maker. In 1855 he became master mechanic in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. That position put a great deal of patronage at his disposal which he used to build support for the Democratic Party. In spite of his growing influence, McLaughlin's candidacy for sheriff of Kings County failed in 1860. In 1861, however, was elected to the office of Kings County Register of Deeds, a function which he kept for three consecutive terms. More important than his public offices was McLaughlin's position within the Brooklyn Democratic party: In 1862 he became the boss of the Brooklyn political machine known as the \\"Brooklyn ring\\". As such, he dominated local politics for many years, despite the efforts of reform-oriented mayors like Frederick A. Schroeder and Seth Low to roll back the influence of the Brooklyn ring. McLaughlin was thus able to play an important role in the creation of Prospect Park and the building of Brooklyn Bridge. However, after the merger of Brooklyn and New York City in 1898, McLaughlin's ring came into conflict with the political machine of Tammany Hall in New York. McLaughlin lost and was forced to retire from politics in 1903. He was succeeded as Brooklyn's political boss by Patrick J. McCarren who forced McLaughlin from power. John H. McCooey.

Widely known for having the most active guillotines during the French Revolution, the square was renamed Place de la Nation on Bastille Day, 14 July 1880, under the Third Republic. The square includes a large bronze sculpture, the Triumph of the Republic depicting Marianne, and is encircled by shops and a flower garden. It is served by the Paris Metro station Nation. History Ancien Regime To this day, Paris bears traces of the Mur des Fermiers g√©n√©raux, a wall built between 1784 and 1791, one of the several city walls built between the early Middle Ages and the mid 19th century well beyond the buildings of Paris in a campaign to encircle houses, gardens and monasteries for the purpose of controlling the flow of goods and to enable their taxation by the Farmers General. The wall's construction left a vast grassy space of vines and market gardens as far as the medieval city wall and the walls of the gardens of the old village of Picpus, which contained large convents, schools and retreats. A throne was erected in this space on 26 July 1660 for the solemn arrival of Louis XIV and Maria Theresa of Spain following their wedding in Saint-Jean-de-Luz. This gave the square its original name of \\"Square of the Throne\\", Place du Tr√¥ne. Originally, the square accommodated two pavilions and two columns of the barri√®re du Tr√¥ne designed by Claude Nicolas Ledoux and built for the barrier of octroi (for tax collection) which surrounded the entrance to the cours de Vincennes. The columns were surmounted by statues of Kings Philip II and Louis IX. French Revolution During the Revolution, the square was renamed Place du Tr√¥ne-Renvers√© - Square of the Toppled Throne - on 10 August 1792. A guillotine was set up in the southern half of the square, near the Pavilion of Law built by Ledoux. Those guillotined there were buried in the nearby Picpus Cemetery and include: * Andr√©-Marie Ch√©nier, 25 July 1794. * C√©cile Renault, Henri Admirat and Jean-Baptiste Michonis, 17 June 1794. * Josse-Fran√ßois- Joseph Benaut, composer, 13 July 1794. * The Martyrs of Compi√®gne, Carmelite nuns, 17 July 1794 19th century The central monument, The Triumph of the Republic, is a bronze sculpture created by Aim√©-Jules Dalou. It was erected to mark the centenary of the Revolution, at first in plaster in 1889 and then in bronze in 1899. The figure of Marianne, personifying the Republic, stands on a globe in a chariot pulled by lions and surrounded by various symbolic figures, and looks towards the Place de la Bastille. When the monument was erected, it was surrounded by a large pond. Additional sculptures of alligators, symbols for the threats to democracy, were removed during the Nazi occupation of Paris and melted down. 20th century On 22 June 1963, the magazine Salut les copains organised a concert at Place de la Nation, featuring singers such as Johnny Hallyday, Richard Anthony, Eddy Mitchell and Frank Alamo. It attracted over 150,000 young people. The headline of the following day's issue of the journal Paris-Presse read, \\"Salut les voyous !\\". The photographer Jean-Marie P√©rier, who was a friend of many of the performers, photographed the concert.

Skyways Coach-Air was its original operator. Dan-Air acquired the aircraft from Skyways International, Skyways Coach-Air's successor, in 1972. At the time of the accident it had flown 34,592 hours. Accident The aircraft departed London Gatwick at 17:28 with an estimated time of arrival (ETA) at East Midlands of 18:25. The crew included two pilots and a cabin attendant, in accordance with Dan-Air's policy to carry one attendant in addition to the flightdeck crew on mail flights. (The attendant was known as a postal assistant on these flights.)G-ASPL.pdf Report No: 5/1983. BAe HS 748, G-ASPL. Report on the accident to BAe HS 748, G-ASPL at Nailstone, Leicestershire on 26 June 1981; 1983 (Publications > Formal reports > 5/1983 G-ASPL) During its initial descent towards its destination, the attendant reported that one of the cabin door's indicators was showing an unlocked condition. Shortly afterwards, the right hand rear door (the baggage door) opened, detached itself from its hinge mounts and became lodged on the leading edge of the right horizontal tailplane. Later reconstruction of the aircraft's flight path from flight recorder evidence indicated that cabin decompression occurred when it was in the vicinity of Market Bosworth. The aircraft became uncontrollable and went into a steep dive, which terminated in several abrupt pitch oscillations. Immediately after the decompression, the pilot asked the co-pilot to transmit a \\"MAYDAY\\" and request permission from air traffic control (ATC) to come straight in for an emergency landing, reporting that he thought he had lost the rear door and that he was having severe control problems. Shortly after, the radar controller who handled flight 240 noticed that the aircraft was turning right beyond its assigned heading; however, his attempts to contact the crew proved futile. Approximately three minutes after the last distress message, reports began to reach ATC from the police of an aircraft crash. Several people on the ground witnessed the final moments of flight 240. The consensus of their evidence was that the stricken plane was lower than usual compared with other aircraft approaching East Midlands, and that it was losing altitude as well as oscillating in both pitch and roll. As it regained level attitude, both wings folded up almost simultaneously and became detached from the fuselage, along with other parts of the structure. The wreckage was found scattered across several fields, approximately northeast of the village of Nailstone. Cause It was concluded that the accident had been caused by the baggage door becoming lodged on the leading edge of the right tailplane after it had opened and detached. This changed the aircraft's aerodynamic characteristics so that it became uncontrollable. This in turn resulted in overstressing of the wings and tailplane leading to inflight structural failure, with both wings and tailplane detaching from the fuselage. Contributory factors were the mis- rigged state of the door operating mechanism, which allowed the top and bottom pairs of catches to lose synchronisation, and failure of the door warning indicators to give the crew enough time to respond to door safety alerts.

The command was established at Smoky Hill AAF, Kansas on 1 March 1944. After a period of organization and its assigned groups receiving their B-29 Superfortress aircraft, the command transferred first to Peterson Field, Colorado, then deployed to the central Pacific, being headquartered at Harmon Field, Guam, in the Mariana Islands. Its assigned units engaged in very long-range bombardment operations, primarily against Japan until mid-July 1945. History The Marianas chain of islands, consisting primarily of Saipan, Tinian, and Guam, were considered as being ideal bases from which to launch B-29 Superfortress operations against Japan. The islands were about 1500 miles from Tokyo, a range which the B-29s could just about manage. Most important of all, they could be put on a direct supply line from the United States by ship. In August 1944, Major General Haywood S. Hansell, Jr was directed to take over command of the organization.Marshall, Chester (1996), Warbird History‚ÄîB-29 Superfortress, Motorbooks International, Serious planning for the movement of the XXI Bomber Command's B-29s from their Second Air Force training bases in Kansas to newly constructed combat airfields on Saipan, Tinian and Guam began in April 1944. The construction and defense of the airfields would be the United States Navy's responsibility, as would logistical support. Before the B-29s could begin operating against Japan from the Marianas, the islands first had to be taken away from the Japanese. This began with Saipan on 11 June 1944 when a four-day naval and air bombardment of the island began. On 15 June United States Marine units stormed ashore, followed a day later by Army units. After several weeks of heavy fighting, during which over 3000 American and 24,000 Japanese lives were lost, the island was finally declared secure on 9 July. The seizure of Saipan enabled invasions of Guam and Tinian to proceed, which were attacked on 21 and 24 July respectively. The Marine Corps and the United States Army 77th Infantry Division's 305th Regimental Combat Team landed on Guam. By 10 August the island was secured. Tinian was assaulted on 24 July, and by 1 August it was secured. Airfield construction Construction of the B-29 airfields on Saipan began almost immediately, even while the fighting was still going on. Naval Construction Battalions (N-C-B), the \\"SeaBees\\" began construction at a former Japanese airstrip called Aslito. This was later renamed Isley Field, after Navy Commander Robert H. Isely (unfortunately his name was misspelled and the incorrect version stuck). The SeaBees did not meet their schedule but came very close. In a little over three months they had built a support base and air field on Saipan, capable of supporting the 240 B-29s of the 73d Bombardment Wing and their logistical support units.Mann, Robert A. The B-29 Superfortress: A Comprehensive Registry of the Planes and Their Missions. Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland & Company, 2004. . On Tinian, the SeaBees built the largest bomber base ever, North Field. The 6th Naval Construction Brigade built four 8500-foot runways for the 313th Bombardment Wing, and all required infrastructure; then went to the west end of the island and at West Field laid down two 8500-foot runways for the 58th Bombardment Wing. On Guam the 5th NCB built North Field for the 314th Bombardment Wing and Northwest Field for the 315th Bombardment Wing.

Formation of 19th Bombardment Group B-29 Superfortresses 1945 The 73d Bombardment Wing was ordered to the Marianas rather than to the CBI Theater after its training with Second Air Force in Kansas. The first B-29 arrived at Isley Field, Saipan on 12 October 1944. By 22 November, over 100 B-29s were at Isley Field. The XXI Bomber Command was assigned the mission of destroying the aircraft industry of Japan in a series of high-altitude, daylight precision attacks. However, General Hansell was fully aware that his crews still lacked the necessary experience to carry out such missions. In late October and early November 1944, a series of tactical raids were carried out as training exercises for the crews. On 27, 18 October B-29s attacked lightly defended Japanese installations on Truk. The submarine pens at Truk were the target, and four Superfortresses had to abort because of the usual engine problems, and combat formations were scrappy. The bombing results were mediocre, with only nine planes bombing the primary target and only a few bombs hitting it. The same two groups returned to Truk on 30 October with even fewer bombs landing on the target. The third try, on 2 November, was briefed as a radar bombing mission. Again the results were indifferent, with bombs scattered all over the general target area. Aware that there was now a new threat, Japanese aircraft based on Iwo Jima staged a low- level raid on Isley Field on 2 November, damaging several B-29s on the ground. Retaliatory strikes were ordered against the two enemy airfields on Iwo Jima on 5 and 11 November with the 497th and 498th Bombardment Groups dispatched to bomb airfields there, but the results were once again poor. As in the XX Bomber Command Operation Matterhorn bombing campaign from India, the B-29s were in danger of being dissipated in tactical missions and even these were not all that successful. In order to properly plan missions to Japan, up-to- date reconnaissance photos of the proposed targets were needed. Other than information which was used during the Doolittle Raid in 1942, there was scant information about the locations of Japanese industry, especially the aircraft industry. On 1 November 1944, two days after arriving on Saipan, A 3d Photo Reconnaissance Squadron (3d PRS) F-13A Superfortress (photo reconnaissance- configured B-29) took off bound for Tokyo. The 3d PRS was attached to the 73d Bomb Wing. The aircraft flew over Tokyo at 32,000 feet for 35 minutes taking picture after picture. A few fighters made it up to the camera plane's altitude but did not attack. These photos, along with other intelligence gave the XXI Bomber Command the locations of the Japanese aircraft manufacturing plants and enabled mission planners to plan missions for the combat crews to attack. In honor of his mission, the aircraft was named \\"Tokyo Rose\\". The 3d PRS continued to fly single plane missions to Japan, taking high altitude pre- strike target planning photos and post-strike damage assessment photos. The losses incurred by the 3d PRS in this type of activity were relatively light. Seldom were the Japanese able to get fighters up to 30,000 feet in time to intercept the photo ships.Birdsall, Stephen (1980), Superfortress, the Boeing B-29 ‚Äì Aircraft Specials series, Squadron/Signal Publications; 1st edition, All four groups of the 73d Bomb Wing were sent on their first mission to Japan on 24 November with 111 planes airborne. The target was the Nakajima Aircraft Engine Plant at Musashino in the arsenal sector of Tokyo. Also, for the first time, the B-29 encountered the Jet stream, which was a high-speed wind coming out of the west at speeds as high as 200 mph at precisely the altitudes at which the bombers were operating. This caused the bomber formations to be disrupted and made accurate bombing impossible. Because of the jet stream winds and bad weather, only 24 planes attacked the primary target; the majority dropped their bombs on the secondary target of the Tokyo Docks. The group returned to Musashino on the 27th and closed out November with a raid on the Tokyo Industrial Area and Docks. The pace picked up the next month, with a return to Musashino on 3 December. Again, poor bombing results were achieved, with the high speed jet stream winds scattering the bomb drops and the aircraft in the formation, with the result of not much damage to the enemy being done. 8 December saw 82 planes attacking the Iwo Jima Air Fields (Motoyama Nos 1 and 2). Then it was back to attacking Japan, hitting Nagoya on 18 and 22 December. The airfields on Iwo Jima were revisited on 24 December and Tokyo the final target of the month on 27 December. In addition to the wing strikes, December saw the initiation of another type of single plane mission: the weather strike. These were missions to Japan to collect weather data and drop nuisance bombs on Japanese cities. Again, these were high altitude missions with surprisingly low losses. The 3d PRS lost two planes in December. Out of the 75 weather strike missions flown in December, there were only three losses. During the same time period the 73rd Wing lost 21 planes to all causes on the six multi-plane raids by the wing as a whole. The pace continued to quicken for the 73d in January. Musashino on 9 January cost six planes; Nagoya on 14 January, another five. One weather strike, out of 83 flown, was lost on 10 January, but help was on the way as new B-29s from the United States were arriving almost daily and new groups were arriving in the Marianas. The 313th Bombardment Wing, operating from Tinian, sent 44 planes to Pagan Island on 16 January, another 33 to Truk on 21 and 28 January to attack the Iwo Jima Air fields on 24 January. Thirty-three more returned to Iwo Jima on 29 January. The 313th's 504th and 505th groups joined in the attack on Kobe on 4 February, while on 9 February their sister groups, the 6th and 9th, made their initial training mission against the Moen Island Air Field on Truk. United States Marines landed on Iwo Jima 19 February 1945 with a mission to seize the island and for Navy SeaBees to utilize the Japanese airfields to build emergency landing airfields for XXIst Bomber Command as well as fighter airfields for VII Fighter Command. On 25 March the Battle of Iwo Jima was declared over and the island secured, although mopping up continued until June. Construction Battalions extended and transformed the former Japanese fields to accommodate B-29s and the first AAF units moved in during the beginning of March.

The high-altitude bombing raids on Japan carried out by the command were not causing a large amount of damage to the targets, primarily due to the jet stream winds over the islands. The failure of the command to successfully carry out its mission was causing severe problems, both with the War Department in Washington, which had planned to eliminate the Japanese industrial base by the same strategic bombing techniques which were being carried out in Europe. Also General Hap Arnold and the AAF command staff which were aware of the Manhattan Project, and planned on using the B-29 to drop the Atomic Bombs, were concerned that the B-29 would be unable to carry out that highly secret mission. Since little progress in the bombing campaign was being made, General Arnold recalled General Hansell and moved General Curtis LeMay from the inactivating XX Bomber Command in India to take over XXI Bomber Command on Saipan. General LeMay arrived in the Marianas on 20 January 1945. General LeMay had analyzed the structure of the Japanese economy, which depended heavily on cottage industries housed in cities close to major industrial areas and issued new orders on 19 February. His plan was to destroy the feeder industries, that would slow or halt the flow of vital components to the central manufacturing plants, and disorganize the production of weapons vital to Japan. LeMay decided to do this by using incendiary bombs rather than purely high-explosive bombs, which would, it was hoped, cause general conflagrations in large cities like Tokyo or Nagoya, spreading to some of the priority targets. In addition, LeMay had concluded that the effects of the jet stream, cloud cover, and high operating altitudes were to blame for the failure of the B-29 raids to do any significant damage to the Japanese war industry. The initial raids against Japan had taken place at high altitudes in order to stay above anti-aircraft fire and the effective altitude of defending fighters. LeMay suggested that high-altitude, daylight attacks be phased out and replaced by low-altitude, high-intensity incendiary raids at nighttime. The aircraft would attack individually, which meant that no formation assembly over the base at the start of the mission or along the way would be needed. This would extend the range of the aircraft and allow them to reach targets in northern Honshu and Hokkaido. The 6th and 9th Bombardment Groups joined in the attack on Tokyo on 25 February, as did the 314th Bombardment Wing's 19th Bombardment Group, flying out of North Field, Guam. With these new tactics, a total of 302 B-29s participated in the Operation Meetinghouse raid on Tokyo on the night of 9‚Äì10 March, with 279 arriving over the target. The raid was led by special pathfinder crews who marked central aiming points. It lasted for two hours. The raid was a success beyond General LeMay's wildest expectations. The individual fires caused by the bombs joined to create a general conflagration, which would have been classified as a firestorm but for prevailing winds gusting at .Rodden, Robert M.; John, Floyd I.; Laurino, Richard (May 1965). Exploratory analysis of Firestorms., Stanford Research Institute, pp. 39, 40, 53‚Äì54. Office of Civil Defense, Department of the Army, Washington D.C. When it was over, sixteen square miles of the center of Tokyo had gone up in flames and nearly 100,000 people had been killed. Fourteen B-29s were lost. The B-29 was finally beginning to have an effect. On the night of 13‚Äì14 March, eight square miles of Osaka went up in flames. On 16‚Äì17 March, three square miles of Kobe were destroyed, and on 19‚Äì20 March in a return visit to Nagoya, three more square miles were destroyed. This destructive week had killed over 120,000 Japanese civilians at the cost of only 20 B-29s lost. A month later, on 12 April, the 314th Bombardment Wing's remaining two groups, the 39th and 330th, joined in the attack on the Hodagaya Chemical Works in Koriyama. With the addition of the 39th and 330th, the XXI Bomber Command now had three wings, twelve groups, thirty-six squadrons of 15 B-29s each at their disposal. In May, the 58th Bombardment Wing completed its move from India to Tinian, adding four more groups to the XXI Bomber Command. In April 1945, General LeMay gave new orders for more incendiary raids. This time, aircraft engine factories at Musashino and Nagoya were to be hit, but urban areas in Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, Kawasaki, Kobe, and Yokohama were also to be attacked. On 7 April 153 B-29s struck the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries aircraft-engine complex at Nagoya, destroying about 90 percent of that facility. Five days later, 93 B-29s destroyed the Nakajima factory at Musashino. The Japanese aircraft engine industry essentially ceased to exist after this time. On 13 April 327 B-29s burned out eleven more square miles of Tokyo. Seven more B-29s were lost. On 5 June, the B-29s attacked Kobe with such effectiveness that the city was crossed off the target list as not worth revisiting. By the end of the month, the six major cities on LeMay's list had all been effectively destroyed. Late May saw the arrival of the first of the 315th Bombardment Wing, whose B-29B planes were equipped with the new AN/APQ-7 \\"Eagle\\" radar. The antenna for this radar was an 18-foot, wing-shaped unit mounted under the forward fuselage. The antenna swept a 60-degree arc along the flight path of the plane, and a higher frequency (X-band) signal gave a much-improved radarscope picture. The 315th had been trained for low-altitude, nighttime pathfinder missions. Between 26 June and 10 August, they carried out a series of fifteen strikes against oil production facilities which essentially shut down the Japanese oil industry. The B-29Bs were also stripped of much defensive gunnery, adding capacity for additional incendiary or high- explosive bombs. By now, the B-29 raids were essentially unopposed by Japanese fighters. In late June, B-29 crews felt sufficiently confident that they began to drop leaflets warning the population of forthcoming attacks, followed three days later by a raid in which the specified urban area was devastated by mass carpet bombing. By the end of June, the civilian population began to show signs of panic, and the Imperial Cabinet first began to consider negotiating an end to the war. However, at that time, the Japanese military was adamant about continuing on to the bitter end. In June 1945, the XX and XXI Bombardment Commands were grouped under the U.S. Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific (USASTAF), under the command of General Carl A. Spaatz. The history of XXI Bomber Command terminated on 16 July 1945. On that date the command was redesignated Headquarters and Headquarters Squadron, Twentieth Air Force. This redesignation brought to an end the XXI Bomber Command as a separate establishment, as it was absorbed into the internal organizational structure of Twentieth Air Force and was placed under the command of USASTAF.

It began combat missions from Tinian in early February 1945. The mining operation was conceived by the United States Navy. At the time, it was considered a secondary mission, but later analysis revealed that it had a devastating effect. Japan was an island nation highly dependent on imports, especially fuel and food. The operation resulted in imports being reduced by almost 95%.

History  Like other patent medicines, Minard's was sold by its creator with exaggerated claims. Dr. Levi Minard the King of Pain from Hants County, Nova Scotia, created Minard's Liniment. The cream is a special liniment for easing stiff, sore muscles, and aching backs. Dr. Minard's preparation, which he developed in the 1860s from ingredients known to bring comfort and relief, became a popular home therapeutic. Its use became widespread throughout the Maritime provinces and in Newfoundland. The popularity of Minard's Liniment then pushed west into Quebec and Ontario, where it became known as the \\"King of Pain Relief\\" because of the immediate relief it brought. The Minard's Liniment brand was acquired by Stella Pharmaceutical in 1998. Active ingredients Camphor: a natural pain relieving analgesic from camphor trees (a broad-leafed evergreen). Camphor stimulates the nerve endings in the skin, producing numbness at the site of application, inducing relief of pain and discomfort in muscle joints and the area below the skin where applied. Ammonia Water: an alkaline substance that helps alleviate burning sensations. Medicinal Turpentine: distilled from pine oil, it is a counter-irritant. A counter-irritant produces a mild, inflammatory reaction where applied in order to relieve more deep-seated pain or discomfort. It has analgesic properties and aids in stimulating circulation.

Laike was born to an Orthodox Christian family, attended Christian school, and joined the priesthood. He was one of the clerics fortunate enough to be tutored personally by Emperor Haile Selassie I, the titular head of the Church. In October 1959, the Ethiopian Orthodox Church officially established a branch in New York; Abba Laike Mandefro, as he was then known, was sent there in 1963 and was given the task of finding a more suitable building for the Church, which was purchased in 1966. Mandefro then returned to Ethiopia to seek assistance for renovations; unfortunately the building was taken by the New York City authorities in his absence. With the assistance of Emperor Haile Selassie, and the Ethiopian consulate in New York, Mandefro returned to New York City and purchased another site for the Church in 1969. In 1970, he was sent to Jamaica where he began to minister specifically to the Rastafari community, at the official invitation of Rasta elders including Joseph Hibbert, who was in turn named as a \\"Spiritual Organizer\\" by Mandefro. Many government officials and others in Jamaica were deeply disappointed that Abba Mandefro defended the Rastafarians' faith on many occasions, and that he baptised thousands of them, pointedly refusing to denounce their faith in Haile Selassie as the returned Christ. On the other hand, a large number of other Rastas were likewise disappointed because he would not baptise them in the name of the Emperor, but only in the name of Jesus Christ. This however did not disturb those Rastas who viewed Christ and Haile Selassie as one and the same, and readily underwent baptism at the hands of this man who had been sent from Ethiopia by their living God. Only after the Marxist Derg Revolution that toppled Haile Selassie and appointed their own Patriarch over the Church, did the requirement become enforced for prospective baptisees in Jamaica to renounce his divinity and cut their dreadlocks. Abba Mandefro also founded many Orthodox Churches throughout the Caribbean and elsewhere, and received the title \\"Archbishop Yesehaq of the Western Hemisphere and South Africa\\" in 1979. On 4 November 1980, he baptized world-renowned Rastafari musician Bob Marley, then suffering from terminal illness, into the church. In the 1990s, a schism happened in the Orthodox Church when the new government of the EPRDF took power in Ethiopia and appointed their own Patriarch, Abuna Paulos. Abuna Yesehaq refused to recognise this political change, pointing out that according to the ancient Church canons, the Church leaders are to remain in office until they pass away, and cannot be dismissed or reappointed by any secular government. However, the New York City authorities took the side of the newly appointed Patriarch, and police interrupted a Church service on 9 August 1998 with guns drawn, using profanity, handcuffed children, and took possession of the Church in the name of Abuna Paulos.

On 22 January 2008, the Government launched the feasibility study. The study, previously led by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) is now led by the new Department for Energy and Climate Change and includes representation from the Welsh Assembly Government and the South West Regional Development Agency. Previous reports on tidal power in the Severn did not‚Äîand did not aim to‚Äîprovide a detailed analysis of all tidal range technologies. This feasibility study aims to consider all tidal range technologies, including barrages and lagoons. The focus is on tidal range technologies as this is where the energy potential in the Severn Estuary is the greatest, as opposed to 'tidal flow' which is the current in moving tidal waters. The tidal range in the Severn Estuary is the second highest in the world and can rise as much as 14 metres, meaning it has the potential to generate more renewable electricity than all other UK estuaries. This could create up to 5% of the UK's electricity, contributing significantly to UK climate change goals as well as European Union renewable energy targets. The Government is carrying out the feasibility study to look at all the costs, benefits and impacts of a Severn tidal power scheme. The study, often incorrectly called the Severn Barrage, looks at all tidal range technologies‚Äîincluding barrages, lagoons as well as other technologies. A decision whether the Government will support the scheme or not will take place after a second public consultation in 2010. It was decided after much debate that the scheme would be closed forever and that this would not be brought up in future discussions to save time. The first consultation of the feasibility study was launched on 26 January 2009 and closed on 23 April 2009. It looked at the scope of the Strategic Environmental Assessment, the issues the feasibility study considered and the shortlisted schemes up for more detailed analysis in stage two.  History   Previous schemes and studies  Proposals for damming or barraging the Severn Estuary (and Bristol Channel) have existed since the 19th century for reasons such as transport links and flood protection. In more recent decades however, (1970s and 80s) there were a number of studies considering barraging the Severn estuary for electricity generation reasons. These studies concluded in 1989 in the government policy document 'Energy Paper 57', which found that an ebb generation scheme (one that generates electricity as the tide goes out) between Lavernock Point and Brean Down, known as the Cardiff-Weston barrage was technically feasible. The annual output of electricity was estimated at approximately 17 terawatt hours (TWh). However, at the time Government decided a Severn Barrage was not a cost-effective option for generating electricity and plans were shelved. A comprehensive history of studies and plans for a Severn Barrage can be found under Severn Barrage.  The Energy Review and the Sustainable Development Commission study  In May 2006, with the growing evidence of climate change and rising fossil fuel prices, the Government called for a new in-depth study into the potential for tidal power from the Severn. The Sustainable Development Commission (SDC), the Government's independent advisory body on sustainable development, was commissioned to look at the issues arising around tidal power, with a particular focus on the Severn Estuary. Their study, 'Turning the Tide: Tidal Power in the UK', concluded that: * The Severn Estuary tidal range can generate some 5% of UK electricity; * the Severn Estuary (and Bristol Channel) tidal stream resource is not one of UK top ten sites; * a barrage can be built that meets the principles of sustainable development but it must comply with the Habitats Directive and other environmental legislation in force; * Government needs to carry out an 'appropriate assessment' using up-to-date techniques to understand the impact; * a large tidal power generation system could be viewed as an 'environmental opportunity' ‚Äì combining climate change mitigation (energy without CO2 emissions) with adaptation (funding potential for a compensatory habitat); and * Her Majesty's Government should own and lead the project.  Aims  The study aims to gather and examine evidence which will enable Government to decide whether it could support a tidal power scheme in the Severn Estuary and if so, on what terms. Building on past studies, the feasibility study will provide an up-to-date overview of all the key issues involved. There are six key work areas which will be looked at closely in the study: * Environmental ‚Äì impacts on biodiversity and wildlife; flood management; geomorphology (the study of the evolution and configuration of rocks and land forms); water quality; landscape; compensatory habitat; * Engineering and technical ‚Äì options appraisal; costs; design and construction; links to the National Grid, supply chain; * Economic ‚Äì financing; ownership; energy market impacts; * Regional ‚Äì impacts on business; regional social and economic impacts; * Planning and consents ‚Äì regulatory compliance; and * Stakeholder engagement and communication. The study will run for roughly two years (until 2010) and will be a two-stage process with a decision point at the end of each. The first stage concluded with a 3-month public consultation launched on 26 January 2009 and focused on the high level issues, the scope of the Strategic Environment Assessment (SEA) and a proposed short-list of potential tidal power project options from the initial 10 schemes. Following consideration of the responses received to the consultation, the gathering of evidence and assessment will continue through phase 2. At the end of phase 2, a second and final public consultation will be launched and Government will make a decision on whether and how a tidal power project could be supported. In doing so Government will consider the costs, benefits, impacts and risks of a Severn tidal power project and whether these are acceptable.  Strategic environmental assessment  As part of the feasibility study, A Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) will take place. An SEA is a formal environmental assessment of plans or programmes which are likely to have significant effects on the environment. The assessment is produced in the form of an environmental report. Proposed projects  A list of ten proposed projects was published in July 2008. The feasibility study looked in further detail at the ten schemes and the consultation document published in January 2009 proposed that a short-list of 5 schemes should be the subject of more extensive research in phase two of the study. The 5 schemes are: * Shoots Barrage (1.05GW scheme located downstream of the new Severn road crossing with an estimated construction cost of ¬£3.2bn) * Beachley Barrage (625MW scheme located further upstream of the first Severn road bridge with an estimated cost of construction of ¬£2.3bn) * Bridgwater Bay Lagoon (1.36GW impoundment on the English side of the Estuary with an estimated construction cost of ¬£3.8bn) * Fleming Lagoon (1.36GW impoundment on the Welsh bank of the Estuary with an estimated construction cost of ¬£4.0bn) * Cardiff-Weston (Lavernock Point to Brean Down) Barrage (8.46GW scheme, commonly known as the 'Severn Barrage', with an estimated cost of construction of ¬£20.9bn). The Government response to consultation was published in July 2009. This confirmed detailed study in phase 2 would be carried out on the 5 schemes that were recommended in the consultation document. It also announced work to bring forward 3 further schemes that are currently in the very early stages of development. A 2009 Paper by Atkins re-evaluated the potential energy which could be generated from the various locations, and concluded that, contrary to earlier studies and computations, the maximum power potential would come from an Ilfracombe- Gower barrage, much further west than any of the schemes the Feasibility Study considered. This different conclusion was attributed to several calculation elements which were neglected in previous numerical models.  Timeline  April to Autumn 2008 ‚Äì Initial focus on the high level issues and potential tidal power options assessment. Late 2008 ‚Äì Government decision on whether there are any issues that mean the project cannot proceed. January 2009 ‚Äì Start of a public consultation on recommended short-list of schemes for further assessment, on the process employed to move from the long list to the short list and the scope of the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA). Spring 2009 - Second phase. Subject to the responses made to the consultation, the issues to be considered will be examined in more detail, the short list finalised and narrowed down to a preferred option or combination of options. 2010 ‚Äì Public consultation on the evidence and conclusions of the study. Following the consultation, Government will make a decision on whether it could support a tidal power scheme, and if so on what terms. Post 2010 ‚Äì If the outcome of the feasibility study is a decision to proceed, extensive and further detailed work would be needed to plan and implement a tidal power project, and secure the regulatory consents that would be required. The government concluded it did not see a strategic case for public investment in a tidal energy scheme in the Severn estuary, but the outcome of the feasibility study does not preclude a privately financed scheme.

He is notable for the establishment and development of the applied physics laboratory in 1930 and the establishment of the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics at the Vrije Universiteit. Education His doctoral research explored the phenomenon of superconductivity at the University of Leiden, following the lead of Heike Kamerlingh Onnes and Wander Johannes de Haas. He completed his PhD in 1926, with a thesis entitled: Onderzoekingen over den suprageleidenden toestand van metalen, under Wander Johannes de Haas. Career In as early as 1929, it was decided that Sizoo act as professor at the newly established Faculty of Mathematics and Physics. Despite his young age he was the only candidate who met the scientific requirements, the right beliefs, and had agreed to the task. Sizoo promoted the then emerging field of radioactivity, partly because there were no other laboratories in the Netherlands exploring this area depth. His own research focused on natural radioactive substances. Sizoo faced a difficult relationship between the reformed religion and science, in the 1930s. He wrote many publications on this relationship. In 1943 the Vrije Universiteit closed its doors, and scientific work in the ensuing time was much more difficult, despite efforts by Sizoo to keep the laboratory equipment from the hands of German occupiers. Shortly after 1945 Sizoo was one of the initiators of the creation of the Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter. In addition, he held numerous positions in scientific institutes and committees. In 1965, at 65 years of age, Sizoo became an emeritus professor, and he continued writing on physics, the relationship between faith and science, and the significance of the science for the Christian foundation of the Vrije Universiteit.

C√©cile-Aim√©e Renault (1774‚Äì1794) was a French woman and royalist accused of trying to assassinate Maximilien Robespierre during the Reign of Terror with two small knives. She was sentenced to death and guillotined on 2 June 1794 (29 prairial year II) in what is now Place de la Nation.  Assassination Attempt  Born in 1774 in Paris, Renault was the daughter of a paper maker, and Robespierre's name was frequently printed upon his products and a frequent part of her early life. Renault approached the home of Robespierre on the evening of 22 May 1794, carrying a parcel, a basket, and extra clothing under her arm that hid her weapons. She was able to successfully enter Robespierre's home due to her young countenance and age, being only about 19 or 20 years old at the time. Robespierre's guards initially allowed Renault to see him and but required her to wait for several hours inside the deputy's antechamber. Upon waiting for several hours and becoming impatient, Renault demanded her hosts have Robespierre meet with her immediately, arguing that \\"a public man ought to receive at all times those who have occasion to approach him.\\" When arrested she said she had been merely curious to see \\"what a tyrant looks like.\\"\\"Citizens\\", Simon Schama, p. 707. She also claimed to her captors that she would \\"rather have one king than fifty thousand.\\" Other sources vary in, some quoting that Renault \\"preferred to have one king than sixty.\\" Robespierre's guards searched Renault's clothing and basket and found the knives purposed to kill Robespierre, miscellaneous papers, and her fresh change of clothing. After placing her under arrest, Robespierre and his guards correlated this assassination attempt to recent attempts during Reign of Terror. This included most notably the assassination of Jean-Paul Marat by Charlotte Corday in 1793. Renault's interrogators also suggested that her assassination plot was a retaliation effort. Her lover had recently been sentenced to death via guillotine by the Committee of Public Safety.  Trial and Execution  Renault was further interrogated and claimed that the extra clothing was for her stay in prison if she was apprehended. Renault also insisted that \\"she never designed harm against any living being.\\" She further claimed that she expected to be guillotined and wished to have a decent dress for the occasion. She was given rags to wear during her imprisonment. Renault, her family members, and other associates who knew her but were all unknowing of the assassination plot were given red shirts to wear as a mark of assassins and murderers. Robespierre included Renault's father, brother and aunt in her trial, noted as accomplices to the assassination attempt. All three were sentenced to death. There exists debate among historians if Renault carried any weapons with her or if this attempt was solely ill-fated fervor. Her admittance to being a royalist supporter is considered to support the existence of her hidden knives. Renault's trial was overseen by Antoine Quentin Fouquier-Tinville, who was heckled by Renault regarding the charges and mocked the council conducting her trial. Renault was said to have shown distress only briefly during her climb to the scaffold. She then smiled, and approached the scaffold gleefully when her turn at the guillotine arrived. The Execution of Cecile Renault and her family members and friends was seen by the Committee of Public Safety as a Royalist conspiracy.

He served as program director of the now defunct Y100 100.3FM (1997‚Äì2005) and its predecessor, WDRE in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (1995‚Äì97), both of which changed formats after being bought by Radio One. McGuinn also served as Program Director for KPNT (1994‚Äì95), St. Louis, and WEQX (1990‚Äì94), Manchester, Vermont, beginning his career in commercial radio as a DJ at WWRX (1988‚Äì90), Providence, following time at his college radio station, WPGU (1984‚Äì88), Champaign, Illinois. McGuinn took the Y100 brand online in 2004 with Y100Rocks.com, meant to serve as the internet reincarnation of Y100 after the public outcry that took place online after the station's modern rock format was abandoned. In August 2006, McGuinn merged Y100Rocks into WXPN's family of programming. In April 2007 McGuinn became the afternoon drive time host for WXPN, following the World Cafe program by David Dye. He also served as the Program Director for Y-Rock On XPN, which exists both as programming on WXPN as well as a full-time internet radio operation. Since January 2009, McGuinn has been program director of Minnesota Public Radio's 89.3 The Current. Radio career as a Program Director As Program Director for Y-Rock On XPN McGuinn was responsible for merging the Y100Rocks brand with the executives at WXPN, chiefly Roger LaMay and Bruce Warren. The unique merging of the Y100Rocks brand into the WXPN family of programming occurred on August 30, 2006. The deal worked such that Y100Rocks continued under the moniker \\"Y-Rock On XPN\\" and while it would continue to broadcast on the internet 24/7, it would also be broadcast on WXPN 88.5FM in Philadelphia on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday nights. The shows that simulcast on WXPN are hosted no longer by McGuinn as he now seves as the WXPN afternoon host. With the merging of the two brands, McGuinn had succeeded in finding a permanent home for the displaced expatriates of Y100, who had been broadcasting online out of various apartment complexes in Philadelphia since Radio One silenced WPLY in February 2005. The executives at WXPN provided the Y-Rock staff - led by McGuinn as Program Director and run by a largely volunteer staff - with studio and office space in their University of Pennsylvania-provided headquarters at 3025 Walnut Street in Philadelphia.

Musical career Prior to and concurrent with a career in radio, McGuinn played in rock bands, starting in high school and college as guitarist and songwriter with Reaction Formation, an '80s era indie rock band that toured the Midwest extensively and released several 7\\" singles and cassettes, some for Go2 Records, a subsidiary of Minneapolis-based Susstones Records. McGuinn later played with short-lived acts 100 Faces, The Glitter Zombies (with Ric Menck and Paul Chastain of Velvet Crush), and Love Cactus. While with Love Cactus, McGuinn co-founded Trashcan Records with bandmate Chris Corpora. Trashcan released a series of cassettes that documented the fertile Champaign, Illinois, music scene of the late '80s, including early work from Jay Bennett's pre-Wilco band Titanic Love Affair, Bad Flannel, and Poster Children's Toreador Squat, which McGuinn also co- produced. After college, McGuinn appeared in more bands, most prominently as bassist with Philadelphia-based Cordalene, who released 3 EPs and a full- length album, The Star-Ledger, between 2000 and 2004. Currently musical activities include membership in Philadelphia musical collective The Wayward Wind; McGuinn plays lapsteel and mandolin on their second album, Wait for Green.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Los Angeles Dodgers. A former first round draft pick, his career had been hampered by various arm injuries. High school years Elbert attended Seneca High School in Seneca, Missouri, and was a standout in football and baseball. In football, he played running back and as a junior, he led the state in rushing yardage and rushing touchdowns and was named as an All-State selection. Elbert is the school's all-time leader with an 0.94 ERA, 433 strikeouts, 29 complete games, and 238.0 innings. He is also Seneca's all-time offensive leader with 28 doubles, 10 triples, 22 homers, and 97 RBI. Baseball career Los Angeles Dodgers Elbert was selected in the 1st round of the 2004 MLB Draft by the Los Angeles Dodgers. He made his professional debut for the Ogden Raptors and struck out 45 batters in 49.2 innings. With the Single-A Columbus Catfish in 2005, he went 8‚Äì5 with a 2.66 ERA in 24 starts. In the 2006 season, he pitched for the Vero Beach Dodgers and earned Florida State League midseason All-Star honors. He was then promoted to the Double-A Jacksonville Suns, where he went 6‚Äì4 with a 3.61 ERA and was ranked as the #3 prospect in the Southern League by Baseball America. He also ranked #11 on MinorLeagueBaseball.com's \\"Top 50 Prospects List. A shoulder injury caused him to miss most of the 2007 season, but he returned in 2008 as a reliever at Jacksonville. Elbert earned his first trip to the Majors when the Dodgers called him up from the minors on August 29, 2008. Elbert made his MLB debut on August 29, 2008, pitching two thirds of an inning against the Arizona Diamondbacks. He pitched in 10 games out of the bullpen for the Dodgers in 2008, finishing the season 0‚Äì1 with an ERA of 12.00. He spent most of 2009 in the minors and was selected as the Dodgers \\"Minor League Pitcher of the Year\\" after finishing a combined 4‚Äì4 with a 3.84 ERA in 18 starts for Double-A Chattanooga and Triple-A Albuquerque. He also appeared in 19 games in the Majors with the Dodgers, finishing 2‚Äì0 with a 5.03 ERA and appeared in relief in Game 3 of the 2009 National League Championship Series. He began 2010 as a starting pitcher for Albuquerque and was promoted to the Dodgers on May 28. He walked three left-handed hitting batters in that game and was promptly optioned back to AAA. He made one more start for the Isotopes before abruptly leaving the team for unspecified reasons. He eventually returned to action by pitching for the Phoenix Desert Dogs in the Arizona Fall League, where he was selected to the \\"Rising Stars Game\\". He began 2011 in the bullpen for Albuquerque and was called up to the Dodgers on May 11. Elbert pitched in 47 games for the Dodgers, mostly as a left-handed specialist. He finished with a 2.43 ERA in 33.1 innings with 34 strikeouts and also saved two games. In 2012, Elbert appeared in 43 games for the Dodgers and had a 2.20 ERA in 32.2 innings. He also spent extended periods on the disabled list because of arm problems, which finally forced him to undergo season ending surgery in mid-September. He underwent another surgery on the elbow on January 23, 2013 due to continued pain in the area. Due to his recovery from his injury, Elbert missed all of spring training and PRP Treatment in March delayed his intended return. He eventually began pitching in rehab games in the minors in May. He seemed close to rejoining the Dodgers and as the last step in his rehab pitched in two games on consecutive days for the Chattanooga Lookouts, however he experienced some pain in his elbow after his last appearance. An MRI exam revealed that he had a complete tear of the ulnar collateral ligament. Elbert underwent Tommy John surgery on June 10, 2013 and was eliminated for the entire 2013 season. He was reinstated from the 60-day disabled list and designated for assignment by the Dodgers on July 29, 2014. He was subsequently outrighted to the Isotopes, where he appeared in 18 games and had a 4.91 ERA. The Dodgers added him back to the roster and recalled him to the Majors on September 12. He pitched a scoreless inning for the Dodgers on September 13, in his first appearance on a Major League mound since August 26, 2012. He appeared in seven games for the Dodgers, with a 2.08 ERA and on September 26 picked up his first win in a Major League game since July 3, 2012. After the season, the Dodgers again outrighted him to the minors. This time he elected to become a free agent. San Diego Padres Elbert signed a minor league contract with the San Diego Padres in January 2015. Pitching style Elbert threw just two pitches regularly: a four-seam fastball at 90‚Äì94 mph and a slider at 87‚Äì90. He threw the fastball a majority of the time against right-handed hitters, but only about half the time against left- handers. Elbert also threw a small handful of changeups to right-handers. He skewed toward throwing the slider in two-strike counts.

He was executed on the guillotine for attempting to assassinate Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois.  Admirat's assassination attempt  Henri Admirat lived in the same building as Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois. He bore many grudges against the Revolution, not least for closing down the public lottery of which he had been an employee, and making him redundant. He decided to assassinate Collot and had lain in wait for his victim, armed with two pistols. Collot, returning from a late-night meeting of the Committee of Public Safety, was chatting with his governess on the stairway when Admirat struck. Admirat fired two shots at Collot at point-blank range, but both pistols misfired. Collot then defended himself with his sword and managed to prevent the would-be assassin from escaping from the building. Admirat barricaded himself in his flat and was later arrested by the passing National Guards patrol, but not before seriously wounding a man named Geoffroy who was helping the National Guards to gain entry into the flat.  Trial and execution  Admirat was brought into the Revolutionary Tribunal and subjected to a trial that lasted only two minutes in which he could only answer. Admirat's sentence of death was a foregone conclusion. He never provided an explanation of the assassination attempt in public and his testimony, written in the secret Committee of General Security, an oppressive police body in the Revolutionary Government, is used by historians with extreme caution. On 17 June 1794, Admirat was guillotined at the Place de la Nation. His body is buried with fifty-three others in Picpus Cemetery.

It is named for Eduard Helly. Consider a game Gamma=leftlanglemathfrak{X},mathfrak{Y},Hrightrangle, between player I and II. Here, mathfrak{X} and mathfrak{Y} are the sets of pure strategies for players I and II respectively; and H=H(cdot,cdot) is the payoff function. (in other words, if player I plays xinmathfrak{X} and player II plays yinmathfrak{Y}, then player I pays H(x,y) to player II). The Helly metric rho(x_1,x_2) is defined as : rho(x_1,x_2)=sup_{yinmathfrak{Y}}left H(x_1,y)-H(x_2,y)right. The metric so defined is symmetric, reflexive, and satisfies the triangle inequality. The Helly metric measures distances between strategies, not in terms of the differences between the strategies themselves, but in terms of the consequences of the strategies. Two strategies are distant if their payoffs are different. Note that rho(x_1,x_2)=0 does not imply x_1=x_2 but it does imply that the consequences of x_1 and x_2 are identical; and indeed this induces an equivalence relation. If one stipulates that rho(x_1,x_2)=0 implies x_1=x_2 then the topology so induced is called the natural topology. The metric on the space of player II's strategies is analogous: : rho(y_1,y_2)=sup_{xinmathfrak{X}}left H(x,y_1)-H(x,y_2)right. Note that Gamma thus defines two Helly metrics: one for each player's strategy space. Conditional compactness Recall the definition of epsilon-net: A set X_epsilon is an epsilon-net in the space X with metric rho if for any xin X there exists x_epsilonin X_epsilon with rho(x,x_epsilon)<epsilon. A metric space P is conditionally compact (or precompact), if for any epsilon>0 there exists a finite epsilon-net in P. Any game that is conditionally compact in the Helly metric has an epsilon-optimal strategy for any epsilon>0. Moreover, if the space of strategies for one player is conditionally compact, then the space of strategies for the other player is conditionally compact (in their Helly metric). References N. N.

The show first ran from 2 October 1992 to 1 September 1998. Its second run went from 29 October 2007 to 2009, and its third was debuted on 10 September 2017. For rules of the game, see the article entitled Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show), as this article only describes the unique differences in the Polish version of the show. Contestant podium color designations The 2007-09 run of the show was one of few versions to use a green podium instead of the traditional blue, using a red-yellow-green sequence. The original show used the reverse order of the American version's color sequence, with blue on the left, yellow in the middle, and red on the right (also using the traditional diamond backdrops as seen in the US version from 1989 to 1992). The current show's sequence is purple-blue-yellow. Differences (1990s version) Ko≈Ço Fortuny was originally a TVP2 show which debuted on 2 October 1992, originally hosted by Wojciech Pijanowski and Magda Masny. Pijanowski left the show in 1995 and was replaced by Pawe≈Ç Wawrzecki, who was himself quickly replaced by Stanis≈Çaw Mikulski until the show's end on 1 September 1998. The show debuted during Poland's period of Z≈Çoty hyperinflation, resulting in the top amounts being z≈Ç5,000,000/z≈Ç12,500,000/z≈Ç17,500,000/z≈Ç25,000,000 until 1995, when the \\"new\\" Z≈Çoty was introduced and all the values were numerically divided by 10,000, with the top amounts becoming z≈Ç500/z≈Ç1,250/z≈Ç1,750/z≈Ç2,500 (the change happened on January 1, 1995 - either before or during Wawrzecki's tenure). The use of a four-round structure was unusual, as this version also used the shopping format until sometime in 1994. Numerically, Poland's top values from 1992-95 were 5,000 times as high as the American top dollar values at the time. From 1995-96, they were half as much as their American counterparts. The contestant podiums were reversed in color to blue, yellow, and red from left to right. Behind the players were diamond backdrops similar to those of the American version, which were used until 1997 most recent. From 1992-96, the Wheel had 21 wedges with three pegs each; this was decreased to 20 wedges with two pegs each when the top amounts were changed to z≈Ç500/z≈Ç1,400/z≈Ç2,000 in 1996, when the Wheel also adopted a patterned color scheme. Bankrupt and Lose A Turn were called \\"Bankrut\\" and \\"Stop\\" respectively, although the latter was \\"Strata Kolejki\\" until sometime in 1993. During a celebrity special for Christmas 1992, the Round 4 Wheel layout was used during the entire game, with no penalty wedges. By Round 2, Niespodzianka (Surprise) was placed on the pink z≈Ç500,000, Zestaw (a set of prizes) on Lose A Turn, and a blue z≈Ç17,500,000 on Bankrupt. Gameplay-wise, there were several large differences from the American version: *Only one arrow was used, located in front of the yellow player's podium. *Vowels cost z≈Ç500,000 until the ‚Äúnew‚Äù Z≈Çoty debuted. In order for a contestant to buy a vowel, s/he needed to choose a consonant that was in the puzzle first. By 1997, vowels were treated the same way as consonants but did not multiply the spun amount (similar to the versions in Brazil and Vietnam). *During the shopping era, the scores of players who failed to solve a puzzle were not affected. From at least 1995-98, however, whenever a contestant solved a puzzle, their opponents were penalized half of their winnings. Players landing on Bankrut were penalized their entire score, regardless of whether s/he had solved a puzzle.  Bonus Round  The Bonus Round was played for a car through 1996 and a prize worth up to z≈Ç10,000 from 1997 to 1998, but the seven envelopes (spelling out F-O-R-T-U-N-A on a pedestal much like the American one used from about 1990/91-92) only determined which five consonants and one vowel the player would receive initially, after which s/he then called for another three-and-a-vowel; if the contestant tried to give a letter already given in the chosen envelope, it was considered a wasted pick and held against the player. The time limit was 15 seconds, which started immediately after any picks were revealed; unlike most other known adaptations of the Bonus Round (apart from various American home console and computer game adaptations and possibly Denmark's version), the player had just one guess at the puzzle solution. If time ran out, or the contestant gave an incorrect answer, he/she did not win the bonus prize. A player who won the car only forfeited any purchased prizes and 90% of all cash winnings but kept any prizes won by landing on prize wedges. By 1993, the seven envelopes were reduced to four (now spelling K-O-≈Å-O with a star between each) and gave just three-and-a-vowel. For a brief time, the graphics were altered to show the chosen envelope's letters and the contestant's picks simultaneously along with the 15-second clock, although this was dropped by Spring 1994. Sometime between Winter 1995 and Spring 1997, the time limit was reduced to 10 seconds; the envelope podium was shrunk to a short, domed style; and each envelope added 0, 1, 2, or 3 letters to the initial three-and-a- vowel.  Sound Effects  *Letter in puzzle: an F-sharp pitch on a synthesizer for each letter. *Letter not in puzzle: a downward glissando on a synthesizer *Puzzle solved: an upward glissando, followed by the music cue *Bankrupt (Bankrut): a vibra slap. * a three-note cue in E-flat major. *Time's up: a repeating high F-natural pitch. Differences (2007-09 version) There was only one Toss-Up puzzle and three rounds before the Bonus Round in the 2007 version. Toss-Up The toss-up was worth a dishwasher or a trip to a hotel in Poland. Whoever buzzed in and solved the puzzle first won the dishwasher or trip and began Round 1. If the first player was wrong, the next player in line got a shot at the puzzle. The puzzle board's border lighted up red, yellow, or green to show who had buzzed in. Vowels Vowels are worth z≈Ç200, and needed to be purchased prior to spinning the wheel. Prizes In Rounds 1 and 3, a purple wedge that had the letters AGD was placed on the wheel. In all three Rounds, two green or silver wedges that had Wycieczka were also placed on the wheel. Round 2 featured prizes that changed from show to show, labeled with the word Nagroda. A player who landed on a wedge, called a correct letter, and immediately solved the puzzle (√† la the Jackpot Round in the United States) won the prize; otherwise, they needed to spin the wheel again or buy a vowel. AGD represented home appliances worth z≈Ç5000, and Wycieczka represented a bonus trip to places such as Italy, Canary Islands, etc. Nagroda represents any other prize, ranging from multimedia to scooters. Other prize spaces include Sklep Internetowy, which represented specific prizes related to the internet and computers, and Skuter, which specifically represented scooters. Penalty Spaces in Polish Bankrut: Bankrupt Stop: Lose a Turn. The Third-Size 10,000 Wedge In Round 2, a one-third size z≈Ç10,000 wedge surrounded by a Bankrupt on each side is featured (Bankrut/10,000/Bankrut). Unlike the US version of Wheel of Fortune, and like the Filipino version and other European versions, landing on the z≈Ç10,000 section earns spendable cash as normal. Since it is worth z≈Ç10,000, a Bankrupt is placed on each side, making it harder to hit. It is unknown whether the money was awarded in multiples or was given at a flat rate but more than likely the latter occurred. Mystery Wedges Round 3 was the Mystery round. The one Mystery wedge with cash hid z≈Ç10,000 (the other was Bankrupt). When a player landed on a Mystery wedge, the player has a choice of choosing a letter for z≈Ç500 or flipping over the wedge, which unlike the American version, must be made before a letter was called. If it was a Bankrupt, regular rules to Bankrupt applied. If it was the z≈Ç10,000, the player had to choose a correct letter in order to receive the cash prize. If (s)he did, (s)he received z≈Ç10,000 regardless of how many times the letter appeared in the puzzle, but the money could still be used to purchase vowels. Both mystery wedges, including the unflipped one, were removed from the wheel (although the host would flip over both when removing them). Bonus Round The 2007-2009 Polish bonus round was played just like the American version has been doing since 2001. The contestant spun a miniature bonus wheel filled with cars, trips, and cash prizes ranging up to z≈Ç50,000. The player received R, S, T, L, N, and E, selected three more consonants and a vowel, then had 10 seconds to solve the puzzle. This time, like the American version, the contestant was allowed an unlimited number of guesses. Sound Effects *Letter in puzzle: no sound for the initial reveal, but when the hostess touched the letters, a high E-flat pitch played for each letter (the same sound carried over from the French version of the show). *Letter not in puzzle/Bankrupt (Bankrut): a downward \\"boop;\\" both cases shared the same sound. * a musical cue.

As part of the debut, producers CBS Studios International and Sony Pictures Television brought Pat Sajak (an ethnic Pole; grandfather was born in Poland) for an appearance, congratulating the show and its host on making its comeback to Poland. The show also features a live house band \\"RBand\\" (similar to the Romanian and Turkish versions of Wheel), and airs in a daytime slot instead of a primetime slot, seven times per week. Two toss-up puzzles are played. The first is worth 500 zloty, played before the first round, and the second, worth 1,000 zloty, is played before the fifth round. The first toss-up determines who starts the round first. Again, vowels cost 200 zlotys. There is now a wedge that says \\"NIESPODZIANKA\\" (\\"Surprise\\"), which varies each time it is hit. The host always announces what the surprise is before the contestant is asked to choose a consonant. If the letter is in the puzzle, the host will then detach the wedge before replacing it with a cash wedge (usually a Swiss watch, leather goods etc.).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJHy9t9r20k The traditional \\"NAGRODA\\" (\\"Prize\\") space remains, and is also detached. Prizes are usually expensive, than surprises (household goods, spa travel etc.). As usual, the contestant must solve the puzzle in that round without hitting the Bankrupt space to win the prize.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJHy9t9r20k Since August 31st 2020, the Free Play (\\"GRAJ DALEJ\\" -- \\"Play On\\") and Wild Card (\\"Z≈ÅOTA KARTA\\" -- \\"Gold Card\\") wedges have been instituted in this version. The top values are now 1,500 zloty for the first regular round, 2,000 for the second, and 5,000 for the third. The spaces worth 1,000; 2,500 and 3,000 surrounded by two small Bankrupt wedges can also be found on the wheel.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJHy9t9r20k The two mystery wedges (written as \\"500?\\") stay on the wheel from round two until each one is flipped over. The player can either take 500 zloty per letter or flip the wedge; the wedge is either Bankrupt or a larger cash prize if the contestant decides to flip the wedge (2000 z≈Ç for Round 2 and 5000 z≈Ç for Round 5). The player must decide if they will unveil the mystery wedge before guessing a letter, unlike its American counterpart, and both wedges are removed after one is unveiled (in the American version, when one is uncovered, the other becomes a standard wedge with the posted value). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJHy9t9r20k The bonus round is played for cash prizes of 10,000, 15,000, 20,000, 25,000, 30,000, 35,000, 40,000, 45,000, 50,000 or 100,000 zloty. It is played like the US version in which the player is given a \\"constant letter set\\" (R, S, T, L, N, and E) and then, picks 3 additional consonants and one additional vowel, and then has 10 seconds to solve the puzzle.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJHy9t9r20k In 2019, Norbert \\"Norbi\\" Dudziuk became the new host, replacing Rafa≈Ç Brzozowski. Brzozowski now hosts the program previously hosted by Norbi, Jaka to Melodia (the Polish version of Name That Tune). Sound Effects and Music * a repeating glissando on an electronic keyboard *Buzz-in sound: A guitar D-major chord. Played only during the toss-up puzzles. *Letter in puzzle: A traditional C-note game show ding (similar to the ding from the U.S. version of The Price Is Right). The squares light up in green; the hostess then touches each letter to make it appear, and each letter she touches is accompanied by a B-flat pitch. *Letter not in puzzle: A guitar downward riff. *Bankrupt/Time's up/Puzzle not solved: A downward cue on a keyboard. *Wild Card: A very special music, after adding one vovel worth 500 zlotys, a cheer effect appears. A pre- recorded track plays when the contestant whose turn it is solves a puzzle, followed by a cue from the live house band. The band uses a different cue if the bonus round is won. Also, if a prize or large amount is hit, the live band will sometimes play a cue if the letter(s) is/are in the puzzle.

Roger Clegg describes White Guilt as an essay arguing that white Americans acknowledged the injustice of the country's racism in the 1960s to admit the error of their racist ways, an admission that left the United States without an acknowledged source of moral authority, replacing old attitudes with a new and deeply felt sense of guilt. Americans moved to atone for their racist past by enacting President Johnson's Great Society, followed by affirmative action and the celebration of diversity. Steele argues that the results were a disaster for black Americans, not only failing to produce racial equality, but requiring blacks to be grateful to the white bureaucrats who now controlled their lives. Reviewer Edward Guthman described White Guilt as rehearsing arguments similar to those Steele made in his earlier books, The Content of Our Character: A New Vision of Race in America, and A Dream Deferred: The Second Betrayal of Black Freedom in America. Roger Clegg compares it with the similar 2006 book by John McWhorter, Winning the Race.

The structure consists of a stem, a bulge region, another stem and a loop. The published structure was determined and refined through experiments. Wingless localisation element 3 (WLE3) is a 53-nt (nt 518‚Äì570) apical localization element within the 3'-untranslated region of the wingless (wg) mRNA. It is shown to be sufficient and necessary for apical RNA transport in microinjection assays and transgenic reporters. Indeed, deletion of WLE3 in an otherwise full-length wg 3'UTR completely abolishes apical localization. However, a minimal WLE3 monomer by itself shows weak activity on its own. The incomplete activity of a single WLE3 element indicates a requirement for additional elements or sequences. Phylogenetic comparison of WLE3 elements predicts a highly conserved stem-loop structure in Drosophila species (using ALIFOLD) and deemed necessary for WLE function by mutational analyses. Full WLE3 activity is dependent on appropriate downstream sequences and can also be blocked by downstream sequences. Targeted mutations on the sequence and structural aspects of WLE3 stem-loop were done and tested showing the distal stem to be most important, the central variable region while must be present its sequences and bulges appear to be unimportant and the WLE3 loop with two invariant residues is not required for localization.

In the United Kingdom it is only a sporadic migrant. These moths inhabit dry open places, meadows, shrublands, grasslands and parks. Description Dorsal view The wingspan of Utetheisa pulchella can reach 29‚Äì42 mm. The front wings are narrow, white or cream coloured with a variable pattern of numerous small black spots located between the larger-sized bright red spots. Sometimes the red spots are merged to transversal bands. The hindwings are wide, white, with an irregular black border along the outer edge and two black markings in the middle of the cell. The head and thorax range from cream colour to buff yellow, with the same pattern as the wings. The antennae are long and monofiliform. The abdomen is smooth, with a white background. Caterpillars are warty, dark brown or greyish, with tufts of greyish hairs, an orange crossline on each segment, a wide whitish line along the back and two other lateral white lines. Biology This species in southern Europe overwinters as a caterpillar. Pupation occurs on the ground near the host plants, usually on fallen leaves and dead vegetation, or pieces of bark and old wood. During mild winters in temperate and typically Mediterranean climates this species hibernates as pupae. Adults of this multivoltine species usually are present from March to early November in three generations a year, but in the tropics, they develop continuously. They fly both day and night and come to light. The polyphagous larvae feed on a range of herbaceous plants, mainly on forget-me-not (Myosotis), Echium, Borago officinalis, Solanum, Plantago lanceolata and Anchusa species.Mazzei, Paolo; Morel, Daniel & Panfili, Raniero. \\"Utetheisa pulchella (Linnaeus, 1758)\\". Moths and Butterflies of Europe and North Africa. In the Afrotropical realm they mainly feed on Trichodesma zeylanicum, Lithospermum, Heliotropium, Trichodesma and Gossypium species. Due to their food, the caterpillars accumulate a large amount of alkaloids, consequently also the moths are toxic and unpalatable to birds. The characteristic colouration of its wings serve as a sign of warning to their predators (aposematism).

It is found in the summer in forested regions of Europe and Northern Asia. This moth was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae.  Description  The red-necked footman is a small moth that is mostly charcoal grey or deep dark brown (fresh specimens almost black), but has a conspicuous orange thorax, part of which is visible behind the black head as an orange-red collar. The hindwings are brownish grey. The antennae and legs are black and the end of the abdomen is yellowish orange or golden yellow. The wings are tightly folded together around the body and have pleated, squared-off ends. The wingspan is and the length of the forewings is . Wilhelm Neuburger named Romanian specimens as the synonym Atolmis flavicollis; these were less dark brown and with a light yellow instead of a red collar.  Life cycle  The white eggs of the red-necked footman are laid in small groups in crevices in the branches of trees, especially those of old firs. They grow to a length of about . Their head is black with a bold diagonal white stripe on either side. Their main colour is dark greenish grey marbled with cream. Each segment bears six tiny reddish yellow warts which bear black hairs. The caterpillars feed on lichens growing on the trunks and branches of trees, and can be found between August and October. They pupate before winter sets in and overwinter as glossy brownish red pupae, in a loose cocoon buried among moss and leaf litter. The moths fly between May and July depending on their location. They are mostly nocturnal, being attracted to lights, but also sometimes fly by day. Sometimes the moths feed at scabiouses and other flowers, but they usually rest during the day on the long branches of firs overhanging paths in woods, where they may be obtained by beating the branches over a net.  Distribution  The red-necked footman is found in Europe south to the Mediterranean and east across the Palearctic to temperate Asia, including Siberia as far east as the Amur River and China. It is found in parts of Ireland, and in the United Kingdom is present in the south- westerly counties of England and Wales. Records from other parts of the United Kingdom probably represent accidentals and not breeding populations. It is a woodland species found in deciduous and coniferous woodland, especially on spruce trees, but also on pine, oak and beech. It likes to be near streams in cool wooded valleys in upland regions.

The next year Jowett was selected to represent Bedell Sivright's British Lions on their tour of Australia and New Zealand, and was selected for one test. Jowett was a high scoring wing, and his 1902/03 season tally of 42 tries for Swansea is still a club record to this day.

There were no fatalities. Accident The helicopter left the Safe Felicia semi-submersible oil rig in the Forties oilfield at 13:45 with 2 pilots and a full load of 19 passengers for the one hour flight to Sumburgh Airport on the Mainland of Shetland. At 14:28 the co- pilot (who was flying) reported hearing a muffled bang which was also heard by some of the passengers, from the area of the No. 2 engine transmission. Shortly after, the No. 2 engine's fire warning lights came on. The pilot immediately began a descent and transmitted a distress call. About 48 seconds after the noise, the No. 2 engine was shut down and the fire extinguisher triggered. The No. 1 engine fire warning then also illuminated, while passengers saw oil leaking from the cabin ceiling. The pilot advised the passengers to prepare for an emergency ditching and took control of the aircraft. The floats were deployed and a gentle ditching was made about 3 minutes after the initial noise had been heard, by which time the helicopter's cabin had filled with smoke. All 21 occupants evacuated on to liferafts and were then winched up into a Search and Rescue helicopter. After a strong fire consumed most of the floating helicopter, the remains broke up and sank. Investigation A recovery operation was mounted using the DSV (diving support vessel) Stena Marianos which arrived on site on 16 July 1988. The aft fuselage section was raised the following day and the forward section shortly after. The recovery operation had to be ended on 19 July before finding the engines or transmission components due to the Stena Marianos having other commitments. The recovery continued on 2 August using the DSV Norskald, and the engines, main rotor, and transmission were located and raised on 5 August. Cause It was concluded that the fire had occurred in the helicopter's main gearbox, probably resulting from the effects of a bearing failure in the No. 2 engine. A further factor was the lack of fire detection or suppression capability within the gearbox bay. The cause of the bearing failure could not be definitely established. Safety recommendations The AAIB made a list of 27 safety recommendations to the CAA. These addressed improvements in maintenance, early detection of problems, emergency escape equipment, documention and training provisions, and firewall integrity. Most of these were accepted by the CAA.CAP 594 Civil Aviation Authority May 1991 Notes  References  * Airliner accidents and incidents caused by mechanical failure Aviation accidents and incidents in 1988 Aviation accidents and incidents in Scotland Aviation in Shetland 1988 in aviation Accidents and incidents involving the Sikorsky S-61 British International Helicopters accidents and incidents July 1988 events in the United Kingdom ","title":"1988 British International Helicopters Sikorsky S-61N crash"},{"id":"19089448","text":"In set theory, a Laver function (or Laver diamond, named after its inventor, Richard Laver) is a function connected with supercompact cardinals.

The labour movement in Sweden dates back to at least the 1850s, when Swedish workers initiated the organizing of previously spontaneous food riots into strikes, hence acting as an autonomous group.Olsson & Ekdahl (2002), p. 13  History  Modern types of labour unions emerged in the 1870s. An event that is usually considered to be central in the early days of the Swedish labour movement is the lecture \\"Hvad vil Social-Demokraterna?\\" (\\"What do the Social Democrats want?\\") by August Palm, at Hotel Stockholm in Malm√∂ 6 November 1881. Five years later, in 1886, Sweden's first national labour union, Svenska Typograff√∂rbundet, was founded.Bj√∂rklund & Edin & Holmlund & Wadensj√∂ (1996), p. 245. Another union of that sort, Svenska Postmannaf√∂rbundet, was founded later that same year.Nycander (2002), p. 18 The labour movement soon divided into two parts, a political one and an unionspecialized one. The union movement was organized in one central organization, the Swedish Trade Union Confederation (LO), founded in 1898, with the aim to organize all national labour unions in one central organization. Parallel to, but closely associated with this movement is the Swedish Social Democratic Party (SAP), founded in 1889.Olsson & Ekdahl (2002), p. 24 These two organizations has ever since dominated not only the Swedish labour movement but also the political life in general. One example of their close association is the fact that all members of LO was initially automatically made members of SAP.Olsson & Ekdahl (2002), p. 24 Even though LO has dominated labour relations in Sweden, the two other big confederations for unions, the Swedish Confederation of Professional Employees, TCO, and the Swedish Confederation of Professional Associations, SACO, are today almost as important participants as LO in the debate of labour economics. In 2008 for the first time the total number of active wage and salary members (i.e. excluding pensioner, students and self-employed) in TCO and SACO together surpassed that of LO.Per 31 December.

This broadcast area was only limited to the Bangkok Metropolitan Area during its early years. On 1 January 1985, it launched its first teletext service known as Infonet. On 1 January 1987, started to air in stereo and, during the 1990s, its stereo broadcast was introduced into its VHF free-to-air station nationwide. TV3 was also experimenting with bilingual transmission using a second audio track in the 1990s. During its early years, Channel 3's airtime lasted 6-hours, broadcasting from 16:00 to 22:00, and later expanded to the daytime hours. For a short period of time, it started broadcasting 24 hours a day in 1997, but was terminated due to the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The network resumed its 24-hour airtime again by 1 January 2005. On 1 January 2001, Channel 3 was the first station in Thailand to broadcast a 3D film. The movie, Jaws 3-D, required a pair of 3D glasses that can either be bought from certain stores partnered with the network for the event or attained from elsewhere.

The town grew under the influence of Queen Margaret to be an important ecclesiastical burgh (a town with special privileges). Until the 17th century, the town was the royal capital of the Kingdom of Scotland. The union of the Scottish and English crowns in 1603 saw the end of the town's special status, which led to decline. Early history Pictish and Gaelic names in the Dunfermline area are multiple. For example, the \\"bal\\" (a dwelling) found in Balmule and Balclune; the prefix \\"caer\\" (a castle) found in Carnock (caer-knock), Cairneyhill and Keirsbeath and Pittencrieff and Pitreative from \\"pit\\". Dunfermline is derived from \\"Dun\\" (fortified hill), \\"fiaram\\" (bent or crooked) and \\"lin\\" (a cascade or pool). A reference of the city's name is found in the tower hill around which the rivulet crooks and drops over a 15-foot cascade of the Ferm burn.Durie, A Century of Dunfermline pp.11‚Äì13. One of the earliest records of the city was known for being used as a centre of the Culdees in 570 AD, based on a site near or on the grounds of the present Abbey. Written history of Dunfermline begins with King Malcolm III in the mid-11th century who would play a pivotal role transferring power from Forteviot in Perthshire to Dunfermline becoming the seat of power and capital of Scotland.Lamont-Brown Fife in History and Legend pp.178‚Äì180. King Malcolm III accepted marriage to Queen Margaret in 1069 as his second wife after she met him in his royal residence which would become the site of Dunfermline Palace.Pride Kingdom of Fife pp.8‚Äì10.Civic Society, \\"Kirkcaldy: A History and Celebration\\" p.12. According to St Dunleum, there is a belief that they may have met previously. Margaret's Benedictine education ‚Äì for which she brought as and became a devout catholic ‚Äì encouraged him to convert the small Culdee church into a Benedictine priory to bring her faith to Scotland to replace the basic needs of the Culdees. The new church was inaugurated around 1072 with Lanfranc, then-Archbishop of Canterbury sending Benedictine monks on the insistence of Margaret who not only dedicated the priory to the holy trinity. Another dedication to the priory was also made to the \\"crucifix of the holy saviour\\" made of ebony, gold and silver and covered in gems from her own homeland. King Malcolm III was killed at the battle of Alnwick, Queen Margaret died in Edinburgh Castle on 10 November 1093. The body of the Queen was taken to Dunfermline for her burial on a site near the Rwde Awtre (the Altar of the Holy Cross or Rood) via the Queen's Ferry but this was journey was made with great difficulty particularly when the castle was under siege by Donald Bane with the only exit in the form of a secret door in the abbey church. Creation and influence of Dunfermline Abbey Dunfermline Abbey The Benedictine priory was raised to the rank of an abbey in 1128 by David II, with Prior Geoffrey in place as the first abbot. During the course of several decades, the abbey gained power and wealth in Dunfermline with the dedication of 26 altars being gifted by the individuals and guilds and the bishop of Dunfermline controlled a large piece of land from Moray to Berwickshire close to the English border which included four burghs and three courts of regality. The abbey was also given permission to dig the lands of Pittencrieff in 1291 for the extraction of coal for personal usage on a lease ‚Äì the oldest record of not only coal mining but also Fife industry benefiting many people who would eventually depend on this livelihood as their source of work in West Fife.Lamont-Brown Fife in History and Legend p.182. There were five individual developments to the abbey all occurring between 1128 and 1450 with the construction of a nave around 1140; the expansion of the choir of the mastried church complete with a shrine in 1240 which was followed by major restoration work of the receptory partially assisted by Robert the Bruce ‚Äì who died shortly after and was buried in the graveyard ‚Äì in 1329 and then later with a new West Gave by Bishop Richard de Bothwell in 1450. Further work centered on the north-west tower of the nave between 1594 and 1599 by William Shaw. The abbey though did have some rough patches with the force of the troops of Edward I causing substantial damage in 1303 which he claimed beforehand: \\"not a church, but a den of thieves.....a thorn in the eye of the English throne\\" with another contribution by the reformation lords in 1560 causing the demolition of some parts ‚Äì including the removal of shrine of St Margaret which has been labelled as maybe their worst act ‚Äì deteriorating the state of the abbey further. History of the town's name and Royal Burgh status The town's name was first recorded as \\"Dunfermelitane\\" in the confirmation charters by David I in 1128. The name of \\"Dunfermline\\" was not officially adopted until 1609 but references had been made in the seals and badges of the royal coat of arms. Dunfermline was credited as a \\"menus burgh\\" by David II with evidence suggesting that burgh of barony status took place between 1124 and 1147.Omand The Fife Book p.136. Royal burgh status was later granted by James VI of Scotland in 1588.Lamont-Brown Fife in History and Legend p.186. Crosswynd, which was once one of the six gates in Dunfermline The construction of six gates in Dunfermline in 1396 were to maintain the burgher's rights; the need for tolls and to a lesser extent to defend. These gates were: The Mill or Collieraw Port (East of Bruce Street); Rottenraw port (near the top of South Chapel Street); Crosswynd Port (now Crosswynd) East Port; Tolbooth Port (bottom of Bruce Street) and West Port (middle of St Catherines Wynd).Durie A Century of Dunfermline pp.15‚Äì17. Dunfermline would remain as the capital of Scotland until the brutal murder of James I at Perth in 1437. The royal family felt safer in Edinburgh Castle, as burghs such as Dunfermline and Stirling could not provide protection in defense of the nobles. Decline of royal status and birth of the linen industry The relocation of the Scottish courts to London being the result of the union of the crowns drawn up in 1603 saw the loss of the city's royal connections. A subsequent fire in 1624, saw a large part of the city in ruin, before being deprived of the eccestrial centre along with St Andrews by the Reformation. Dunfermline quickly sank into decline. In the 18th century, the city impressed Daniel Defoe as showing the \\"full perfection of decay\\". The town would soon regained prosperity with the introduction of the weaving of linen damask ‚Äì which would eventually become recognised as the world's leading producer ‚Äì established by James Blake in 1718 after being inspired by having gained the experience of the special technique of one in Edinburgh as the way to take Dunfermline forward. Dunfermline became one of four main centres of the industry alongside Kirkcaldy, Dysart and Leslie in 1810. Although the first power looms in operation brought greater demand for the town's linen industry by 1825 as Dunfermline began to acknowledge the coming of the industrial revolution. The undemining success of the linen in Dunfermline was prompted by a report by the Ordnance Gazette in 1894 who said: \\"The damask manufacture of Dunfermline is probably unequalled in the world for design and beauty of finish\\". Among other industries that have largely contributed to the welfare of the town are dyeing, bleaching; soap (from the 1790s); rope-making (from the 1830s); iron founding ; textile milling; distillery and brewing.

Following the marriage George Augustus moved to the Kingdom of Great Britain and after learning the English language volunteered to serve in the Royal Navy.

During his time in Great Britain George Augustus became a Doctor of Laws and attended observations of the 1769 Transit of Venus at the King's Observatory in Richmond-upon-Thames.

The Empress who was only concerned if George Augustus had forgotten that he was Lieutenant-Colonel in her service, responded by promoting him to the rank of Colonel after the complaining officer admitted he was a good officer as she was only interested that he did his duty as an officer in her service. He continued his rise up the ranks and a short while after being made a colonel he was made 'General of Horse' and was decorated with various honours.

Research methods include prospect screening companies, prospect research consultants, and in-house researchers. Prospect researchers are usually employees of universities, charities or other not for profit organizations. Some are freelancers, or work for private companies. Organizations generally employ prospect researchers to find and qualify potential \\"major\\" donors who have the resources to make a large gift to the organization, although the definition of a \\"large\\" gift can vary considerably. A prospect researcher will assess an individual's, company's or charitable trust or foundation's capacity and propensity to donate. Prospect researchers use a variety of resources, including public records, business and financial publications, and Internet databases. Prospect researchers also focus their search on individuals, companies and foundations on their specific giving interests and philanthropic histories, should they already exist. Most prospect researchers adhere to a code of ethics to protect both the institutions they represent and the prospects they research. Prospect researchers conduct research to evaluate a prospect's ability to give, also called capacity (how prospect can financially contribute to your organization), their warmth toward the organization, also called affinity (how close the prospect feels to the organization), and propensity (how likely the individual is to give at all). Prospect researchers may also analyze data in a donor or constituent database to identify new potential major donors or to predict which groups of constituents are most likely to make major gifts. Wealth ratings usually refer to a prospect's capacity to donate. One of the most common sources used by prospect researchers for this task are Rich Lists. The Sunday Times Rich List is widely referred to by prospect researchers, but its overall value is disputed. There is a large variety of algorithms that many scholars use to create a wealth score; most would agree in America real estate is the main indicator. Research is generally conducted via the Internet, but it is also done with the use of subscribed databases like Factiva, LexisNexis and FAME. A researcher may also use government-managed resources such as Companies House, the Charity Commission, or HM Land Registry. Other useful resources include Debrett's and Who's Who, which can provide good general background on any prospect. Prospect research is an established component of the Prospect Development field pioneered by Bobbie J. Strand, which also encompasses relationship/pipeline management and data analytics for advancement.

Early life and career Born in the fishing port of Gloucester, Massachusetts, the young Gann moved with his family to California, where his father built and operated a commercial fishing clipper. During World War II, he served with the United States Navy. Following his discharge, Edmund Gann went to work managing a grocery store his father had acquired as an investment. From there, he entered the fishing business with his brother Joseph and their company, Caribbean Marine Service Co. Inc., became a highly successful tuna-fishing fleet operator. Tri-Union Seafoods In 1997, Edmund Gann partnered with Tri-Marine International, Inc. of Singapore and Thai Union International of Bangkok to create Tri-Union Seafoods LLC which acquired the San Diego, California based canned tuna processing and packing company, Chicken of the Sea. In 2000, Gann sold his twenty-five percent stake in Chicken of the Sea to Thai Union International.\\"Our History \\". Chicken of the Sea. Although the fishing industry has been where he had his principal investment, Edmund Gann also has had interests in the oil industry, banking, hardware, and real estate development. Thoroughbred racing :Stable Colors - Red, white and blue silks; matching cap In the mid 1960s Edmund Gann became involved in thoroughbred horse racing by accident after a friend was unable to repay a loan and offered a racing mare, named Bold Producer, instead. With little alternative, Gann took ownership of the horse, which promptly won three straight races. Enamored with racing, he began building a solid stable by buying horses in the United States as well as in Europe. In 1975, he hired future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Robert Frankel as his trainer. For twenty-one years they worked closely and met with considerable success at racetracks across the United States. However, in October 2006, the two parted company and Gann transferred the bulk of his horses to trainer John Sadler. Along with Marty Wofson in Florida, Bill Mott also trains some of Gann's horses.Haskin, Steve (October 25, 2006). \\"Frankel, Gann Part Company\\", Blood- Horse.

As of January 2009, there were 20 class 311D completed (15 for PCC Rail and five for the Baltic Railways) and six 311Da for PKP LHS, where they are designated ST40. Specification The locomotive is a modernisation of the popular Soviet locomotive M62 (ST44), which can be noticed by the chassis structure and carriages. The drive unit has been completely changed by installing a more efficient engine by the General Electric company which is placed in one place together with the main generator, compressor and fan. The most visible change is the complete change of the structure, the internal passageway between the cabins, having a driver's cab at each end and that the train has transitions outside with the jetties.

It is between the towns of Crognaleto, San Giorgio and Aiello in the Vomano Valley. Figliola faces the Gran Sasso and can be reached via a road that is partially paved. According to some historians, the village takes its name from the Italian word Filiola meaning a small stream of water. At one time, the village was part of the feudal holdings of the Dukes of Atri. During the 17th century, the village, likely, served as a refuge for brigand soldiers while their leaders took shelter in the a nearby castle in San Giorgio. During some of the fiercer skirmishes, the brigand likely fled to the Papal States just north in what today is Italy's Marche Region. In 1804, only 36 people lived in the village. Nine years later Figliola was assigned to the comune of Crognaleto. Today, the village is uninhabited. Most of the houses in the village are constructed of stone. Although few people visit the village in the winter, several families have restored houses that serve as summer homes and are used primarily in the summer months. For religious purposes, Figliola belonged to the church parish of Macchia Vomano. The village church is dedicated to Saint Mary Madelene.

Diana Bar is a beach library and gallery in P√≥voa de Varzim, Portugal. Before being a public library it was a historic caf√© with the same name. It is located in the south end of the city's main waterfront avenue, the Banhos Avenue (Avenida dos Banhos, literally Baths Avenue). It includes bar and Internet services, and is often used for exhibits and book presentations. The library is very popular, because of its beach view and large windows, in the summer it often gets over 800 visitors per day. The arts TV show, C√¢mara Clara, of the public broadcaster RTP, was broadcast from there during the 2006 Correntes d'Escritas International literary meeting in P√≥voa de Varzim. A rose colored building, Diana Bar is surrounded by the beach except in the entrance by the Banhos Avenue. It has an egg-shape architectural conception, with large windows and a wide interior. It has an internal balcony around the building that functions as the second floor. Diana Bar's floor mimics the Portuguese pavement, for exteriors, and is a drawing of concentric circles. History Diana Bar was built over the beach between 1938/1939, and due to its select nature, it soon became a writers meeting place and for intellectuals coming from various cities. It was where Jos√© R√©gio wrote some of his works, and still today, the table and chair that he often choose are exhibited with his portray. Diana Bar was where Jos√© R√©gio and Agustina Bessa-Luis often met, when she was living in Esposende and he in Vila do Conde. Agustina lived in P√≥voa de Varzim earlier in her life, a town that she described as a \\"magical place in the beginning of my adolescence\\". With the death of its founder, the building entered into decay for several years. In November 2001, P√≥voa de Varzim City hall bought and restored the building. In the summer of 2002, Diana Bar was ready to reopened as a beach library for the general public, first only in the summer months, but given its popularity it soon started to offer its services all year around.

Career Cammerer was working as the Executive Secretary of the Fine Arts Commission in Washington, DC, which reviewed agency projects in the capital against design guidelines and aesthetic issues. The U.S. National Park Service's first director, Stephen Mather, had encountered Cammerer at the commission and recognized his competence as executive secretary. He appointed Cammerer as assistant director in 1919, replacing previous assistant director Horace M. Albright, who then became Director. Cammerer served as Mather's right-hand man in Washington and acted for him in his frequent absences over the next decade. After the project to found Great Smoky Mountains National Park proved expensive, Cammerer secured a promise from John D. Rockefeller Jr., to match $5 million in the acquisition of Shenandoah National Park lands. He advanced to the new rank of associate director on January 12, 1929.

Under his leadership, the NPS tripled the number of areas served, increased visitations from two to 16 million, became involved with recreational area planning and management, began to survey and record historic sites and buildings outside the existing parks, and worked with Congress to pass the Historic Sites Act, as well as a law establishing the National Park Foundation.

Zax is an animated mascot character featured in 1980s public service announcements for Charlotte, North Carolina electric power company Duke Power. The character, introduced in 1984, was designed to appeal to children, and educate them about the dangers of electricity, and how to use energy more efficiently. Zax's voice was provided by Charlotte weatherman Larry Sprinkle. The character appeared in animated PSAs on television, in a Sunday newspaper comic strip, and in live appearances by a costumed actor at libraries and elementary schools. History In 1984, Duke Power released a series of public service announcements to educate children on how to be safe and use electricity efficiently. These cartoon PSAs featured a small, eager to learn computer generated program named Zax, and a group of children who tried to keep him from getting injured or killed by electricity. Zax appeared in a number of cartoon PSAs throughout the 1980s. In the first 60-second spot, a young boy draws a cartoon of a friendly robot on his computer. When the boy goes out to play with his friends, he says that he wishes Zax could come outside and play with them. The creature leaps from the computer screen to join the children, and immediately decides to climb a transmission tower. The children explain that he's not being safe ‚Äî kids should never try to climb electric poles or towers, or fly kites and planes close to power lines. Zax thanks them, and admits, \\"Zax has much to learn. Will you teach me?\\" The boy says, \\"This could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship,\\" as the group walks into the sunset. Other spots feature the children stopping Zax from taking a bath with electric devices nearby, or going near downed power lines after a storm. The PSAs concluded with the line, \\"This message brought to you by your friends at Duke Power.\\" Duke Power also produced Zax teaching kits for classroom use, including posters, light switch faceplates, a film-strip and an audio cassette that featured Zax and his friends. In later years, Zax was used for Electric Safety poster contests. Zax was also used for local Earth Day events, along with fellow safety mascots Smokey Bear and Woodsy the Owl. As late as 1997, Duke Power was still distributing Zax coloring books and showing a film called \\"Zax's Electric Safety Team\\" at North Carolina 4-H club meetings. Duke's \\"World of Energy\\" exhibition hall at the Oconee Nuclear Station in Seneca, South Carolina, includes a display with a life-sized sculpture of Zax.

Capabilities  The Emerson Cavitation Tunnel consists of a water circuit which flows in the vertical plane, within which propellers and other propulsion devices can be tested. The system is powered by a pump, with a four-bladed impeller and can produce a maximum water velocity of . The test area has a cross sectional area of allowing model propellers of up to in diameter to be tested. The pressure range of the tunnel can vary from a minimum of 7.6 kN/m2 to a maximum of 106 kN/m2. Cavitation numbers of 0.5 (minimum) to 23 (maximum) can be accommodated for. Measurements can be taken using a 3 Watt, water-cooled, Argon-ion laser, a hydrophone, and two dynamometers. A high-speed video camera is also attached with an imaging frequency of 1‚Äì10,000 frames per second. Funding for the tunnel's equipment is raised by numerous organisations, including the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and the Scottish Universities of Glasgow and Strathclyde.  History  The tunnel was first established at the University in 1949 after being disassembled and transported from Pelzerhaken, Germany after the Second World War. The tunnel arrived at the University in 1947 and over the following few years the tunnel was heavily modified. The tunnel - which was originally designed to be operated in the horizontal plane - was converted into a vertical loop tunnel and the length was reduced by half. The original observation window was modified and two more added. Because of damage, a new impeller was constructed and numerous pieces of measuring equipment were added. This equipment included pitot tubes, a tachometer, stroboscopic lighting equipment, contact meters and a vacuum pump. The tunnel was connected to an electrical supply in 1949 and entered service late in 1950, after technical problems called for recalibration of some of the instruments. The Cavitation Tunnel was housed in Newcastle University's old boiler house, where it was originally reconstructed. That location was on King's Road in the middle of the University's city centre campus between the Armstrong building, the Student Union, the Arches and the Bedson building. In 2016, the tunnel was moved from the Newcastle University city centre campus and taken to Poland, where it was fully refurbished before being brought back to the North East and installed in a new purpose-built research centre, Marine campus at Blyth. The first research grant of ¬£8,000 was awarded in 1950 for the testing of a new series of propellers, and was awarded by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR). In the 1970s and 1980s, the tunnel was extensively modified and upgraded in order to improve the range of propellers that could be tested. The tunnel was also renamed to its current name, the Emerson Cavitation Tunnel after Dr Arnold Emerson, who was the tunnel superintendent and the driving force behind the upgrades. Modifications were made to the tunnel during the 1980s. New computer-based data collection, interpretation and analysis technology has been added to aid with computational fluid dynamics. Data is also collected with the help of laser doppler anemometry (LDA) and phase doppler anemometry (PDA).

A severe stutterer throughout his career, he is described as having had the most influence of any speech-language pathologist in the field of stuttering. Biography Charles Van Riper, known to his family as Cully, grew up in Champion Township, Michigan. He was the son of Champion's physician, known as \\"Dr. Van\\". Charles began to stutter at two years of age, and had a \\"miserable childhood\\" growing up in the midst of local superstition about stutterers. Even though he stuttered throughout his schooling years, he did very well academically, reading voraciously and showing great talent for writing. He subsequently attended the Northern State Normal School, and then the University of Michigan where he won honors for creative writing and graduated with a Master of Arts in English. After graduation, he taught high school English in Saline, Michigan, developing many techniques for dealing with his stuttering while teaching. Although he was regarded as a proficient and innovative teacher, the stress of his stuttering and his fear of speaking in many situations, made him unhappy at teaching. A severe stutterer, Charles attended two institutes for stutterers, the Bogue Institute of Stammerers in Indianapolis and the Millard School in Milwaukee, but these institutions did little good; at the time, \\"nobody had actually taken the trouble to learn about stuttering, so nobody knew how to cure it\\". He subsequently joined a graduate program in speech pathology at Iowa, where he and other graduate students tried to develop \\"practical techniques\\" of a treatment for stuttering. These attempts proved successful, and after several years in Iowa, Charles received his Ph.D. in speech pathology. In 1936, Charles was hired by the Western State Normal School in Kalamazoo, Michigan. He founded and headed its speech clinic, and was the first chair of its speech pathology and audiology department. During his subsequent career he became internationally known as a pioneer in the development of the science of speech pathology; he worked with thousands of stutterers, did research, and published a large number of books, articles and films on the subject.

Charles wrote in a letter to a newsletter that he had lived a \\"very successful and happy life\\", a result of an idea that came to him while hitch-hiking his way home from Rhinelander, Wisconsin, where he had spent a month as the hired man on a farm, pretending to be a deaf mute because his stuttering was so severe that he could not get any other employment: he met an old stutterer who said that he was \\"too old and tired to fight myself now so I just let the words leak out\\"; Charles realised that he should have been seeking a way of stuttering that would be tolerable both to others and himself, instead of avoiding and hiding his stutter.

Career Charles Van Riper developed stuttering modification therapy between 1936 and 1958. This type of therapy focussed on reducing the fears and anxieties of adult stutterers, and added methods to modify the \\"core behaviors\\" of stuttering, to make them less physically stressful. This therapy is one of the most widely practiced stuttering treatments. Additionally, several of his books were the authoritative books on the subject for a number of years, namely The Nature of Stuttering, The Treatment of Stuttering and Speech Correction: Principles and Methods, the latter book being the first textbook in the field. Textbooks he authored have been used in both undergraduate and graduate courses in stuttering.Williams, D. Wendell Johnson and Charles Van Riper. Minnesota State University (February 22, 1999). Retrieved on 2008-08-30. Charles approached stuttering from the viewpoint that the stutterer should scrutinize his stuttering behavior, to become aware of everything he did from anticipation of stuttering, to struggling during a block, and to the utterance of the word. A speech-language clinician using his methodology was to explain to her client the nature of the many attitudes and behaviors of stutterers. Wendell Johnson, a member of the same graduate program in Iowa who also became renowned for his work in the field of stuttering, said that Charles Van Riper's methodology was hard work. As a clinician, Charles was known for being warm and sympathetic, but tough on adult stutterers who refused to work and cooperate with him, since they were expected to be able and willing to practice behaviors and attitudes that would minimize their stuttering. Legacy Years after his death, Van Riper's work continues to be referred to and analyzed.

Jones Construction, Panama City, Florida. She was launched on 27 February 1945, sponsored by Mrs. John E. Davidson, and delivered on 14 March 1945, to the Alcoa Steamship Company. Service history She was acquired by the Navy from the US Maritime Administration (MARAD) on 10 June 1955. She was converted to a radar picket ship at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, and commissioned Scanner on 30 January 1956, with Lieutenant Commander Henry Hayworth Pruett, USN, in command. Scanner departed Norfolk, on 28 March 1956, for her home port, San Francisco, California, and commenced her first patrol in the Pacific Ocean in July 1956, with the seaward extension of America's early warning defense system. Fitted with sophisticated electronic search and tracking equipment, Scanner could detect, track, and report enemy aircraft at great distances, and control high speed interceptor aircraft in event of attack. She also carried out weather reporting duties during her three to four-week-long cruises. Decommissioning Scanner was redesignated AGR-5 effective 28 September 1958. She was decommissioned on 21 July 1965, at San Francisco, and turned over to Maritime Administration (MARAD) custody on 26 July, at Suisun Bay, California. Struck from the Navy List on 1 September 1965, she was transferred permanently to the MARAD on 4 February 1966, and remained in the Suisun Bay reserve fleet until 3 October 1974, when she was sold for non-transport use.

Most species of the genus are known from fragments of the armor, but the Gogo Reef species, H. westolli, is known from whole, articulated specimens. According to these specimens, species of Holonema lived by grazing on stony, horn-shaped, stromatolite-like algae called oncholite, apparently by snipping off the points with a specialized snout. Species H. rugosum H. rugosum is the type species. It was originally described as a species of the antiarch genus, Pterichthys. Fossils are found in Frasnian strata of New York and Pennsylvania, and Givetian strata of Wisconsin and Michigan. It is a fairly large species, though the type specimen is of an 18 centimeter long median dorsal plate belonging to a small individual. Fossils of H. horridum and Glyptaspis eastmani may be this species. Fossils from Frasnian Iran (H. cf. rugosum) may also belong to this species. H. arcticum A large species from Givetian-aged strata in Novaya Zemlya, Russia, known only from two plates from one individual's trunk shield. H. bruehni H. bruehni is a recently discovered species from the Middle Eifelian-aged Brandenberg stratum of Sauerland, Northwestern Germany. Juveniles had a dermal ornamentation of irregularly spaced tubercles, while the dermal surface of adults' armor were smooth.Otto, Markus. \\"New finds of vertebrates in the Middle Devonian Brandenberg Group (Sauerland, Northwest Germany).\\" Pal√§ontologische Zeitschrift 72, no. 1-2 (1998): 117-134. H. farrowi Known from fragments from the Givetian-aged \\"Traverse Group\\" stratum in Michigan. The median dorsal plates range up to 20 cm in length. The median dorsal plate is fairly broad at the posterior end, but narrows as one approaches the anterior end. H. haiti Known from fragments from the Givetian section of the Jefferson formation in Idaho. The median dorsal plate is estimated to be about 28 cm in length, and is very narrow compared to those of other species. H. harmae Found in the Givetian-aged Burtnieki beds of Estonia. It is distinguished from other species in that the spinal and subpectoral margins of the anterior-ventral plates meet at almost a right angle. H. obrutshevi Found in the Eifelian-aged Aruk√ºla beds of Estonia. The median dorsal plate has a small, horn-like process, and the trunkshield is somewhat circular when viewed from the top or bottom. H. ornatum From the Givetian-aged Bressay flags of the Shetland Islands. Imperfectly known. Denison 1978 suggests that it may not belong to Holonema. H. radiatum This is species is known primarily from the Frasnian-aged Shelon beds of the Baltic, and the Donetz Basin of Russia. Specimens and fragments from the Frasnian-aged Holy Cross Mountain of Poland, and the Givetian sections of the Fiskekl√∏fta formation in Spitzbergen. It is a fairly large species with a moderately narrow median dorsal plate. The median dorsal plate averages about 30 cm in length. H. westolli This is the best-known species of the genus, known from numerous, often articulated specimens from the Frasnian-aged Gogo Reef. The species is very similar to H. rugosum, but the trunk shield is comparatively more narrow. The median dorsal averages about 23 cm in length, and the average body length of living individuals are estimated to be around 150 cm.

It is the latest installment in the Gradius series, and was released in Japan on September 2, 2008, and in North America on March 9, 2009, and in the PAL regions on July 3, 2009. Gameplay Gradius ReBirth is a side- scrolling 2D shooter much like previous Gradius games, and has been described as a \\"remix\\" of levels from past games rather than an entirely new game. The game features two modes: a standard game with unlimited credits and a Score Attack mode where players are only given a single credit to beat the game. Score Attack also supports online leaderboards. The game features five different types of ships to choose from, and five stages in total, with each (except the first stage) having its own original boss at the end. Plot This game takes place in the Gradian Year 6664, two years before \\"The Silent Nightmare Incident\\". The planet Antichthon, a protectorate of the Gradian Empire, suddenly and mysteriously falls silent. A report was made by the Director General of the Space Science Agency, Dr. Venom, which mentions that Antichthon's mother computer was now under the control of the Bacterians. Realizing that a threat from the Bacterians may be imminent, the Gradian Government deploys its Gradian forces to combat the threat. Among them is Special Colonel James Burton, who had defeated the Bacterians a few years ago. Armed with an A.I. program called Gaudie, James Burton sets out in the hyperspace fighter known as the Vic Viper, in the hopes that he can combat the new Bacterian threat. But little does James know that there's much more in store for him... Development Gradius ReBirth uses the Nemesis titles for the MSX as its basis. The power meter and text display have also been updated. The music was composed by Manabu Namiki and consists of remixed music from previous Gradius games. An update to the game was released on the Wii Shop Channel for free of charge. It improves some of the visuals and adds a new ranking board for the adjustments made to the score system. In addition to this, there are new music tracks and a few changes to the game's levels. Reception Gradius ReBirth received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. IGN praised the nostalgic retro design but found the game to be punishingly hard for most players and the lack of multiplayer disappointing.

These books are notable for their marriage of two distinct genres: Sword and Sorcery and Romance. They take place in the mythical kingdom of Gillengaria which is ruled by good king Baryn. The land of Gillengaria is an island divided into twelve semi-independent fiefdoms each ruled by a great house. King Baryn has only one child, believed by many to be unfit to rule. The Twelve Great Houses are jockeying for position to be ready to contend for the throne when King Baryn dies. This jockeying is tearing the kingdom apart, and has brought it to the brink of civil war. In addition the general population is angry at the king for defending the mystics which they fear and despise. The mystics are people born to magical powers, usually of a quite limited scope such as being able to change shape, or being able to start fires. Any family of any rank can produce a mystic. Usually if the family is prominent the child is cast out. In addition to the Mystics, and the Twelve Great Houses, there is a third power group, the King's Riders. The King's Riders are a band of fifty bodyguards who are fanatically loyal to the king. They are depicted as being extraordinary fighters, skilled with all weapons. It currently consists of these books. * Mystic and Rider (Ace Books, 2005) * The Thirteenth House (Ace Books, 2006) * Dark Moon Defender (Ace Books, 2006) * Reader and Raelynx (Ace Books, 2007) * Fortune and Fate (Ace Books, 2008; new story arc) 150px The first four books complete a story arc. The fifth book starts a new story arc. Plots Mystic and Rider King Baryn sends Senneth on a mission to discover the mindset of the twelve marlords of Gillengaria about a potential revolution ‚Äì and towards mystics. The king orders two of his best Riders to escort her - Tayse and Justin. Serramarra Kirra and her companion Donnal volunteer to accompany them. Along their journey they find Cammon and bring him with them. The group discovers the southern marlords are more supportive of the idea of rebellion while the northern marlords stand with the king. Meanwhile, Senneth and Tayse fall in love. But first Senneth must convince Tayse he is not unworthy of her. The Thirteenth House The king requests Senneth accompany his daughter on her first tour of Gillengaria. Everyone from their previous group ‚Äì Tayse, Justin, Kirra, Donnal, and Cammon ‚Äì comes with them. Kirra, however, is disguised as her sister, Casserah. Dark Moon Defender Justin is sent to spy on Coralinda Gisseltess and her convent of Pale Mother worshippers. He meets and befriends Ellynor, a young Lirren girl sent to the convent to watch over her flighty cousin Rosurie. Justin later figures out that she is a mystic, and helps her escape from the convent. Ellynor and Justin fall in love, but since Justin is outside the sebahta-ris, or clan network, of the Lirrens, their love would result in a fight to the death between Justin and a male relative of Ellynor's. Senneth discovers that the two can be married if Ellynor declares herself bahta-lo ‚Äì free of the clan. Reader and Raelynx The king decides to attempt to divert the coming civil war by marrying his daughter off to one of the southern marlords. Cammon is assigned to read the intentions of Princess Amalie's suitors. Unfortunately, he and the princess soon fall in love themselves. The civil war, led by Coralinda Gisseltess, who has been trying to stamp out mystics and their magical practices, her brother, the lord of Gisseltess, and the lord of Fortunalt, ends with the death of King Baryn, and the deaths of the three leaders of the rebellion. Some Riders die in defense of King Baryn. Some of those who don't die resign from the Riders, because they feel that they failed in their principal duty. Fortune and Fate This book starts a new story arc, with new characters. This book introduces Wen, who is a former King's Rider. She failed to protect King Baryn during a rebellion for which she feels crushing shame. She is also suffering because of the marriage of Justin, a man she loved, to another. Wen wanders over the country, looking for wrongs to right, but does not stay anywhere for very long. Eventually, she saves Karryn, the daughter of a rebel, from kidnapping and ravishment. Jasper Paladar, the uncle and guardian of Karryn, asks Wen to train a corps of bodyguards. She reluctantly agrees, and over time recovers from her heartbreak to fall in love with Jasper. The action is divided between Wen's work to create a competent guard for Karryn, the heiress of Fortunalt, and a tour of the country by Cammon, the Queen's consort, with Tayse and other riders and guards, plus Senneth, Tayse's wife. Near the end of the book, when Cammon's tour has come to Fortunalt, and a plot to kill Karryn has been foiled, Tayse and Senneth come to believe that the main reason for making the tour was actually so Cammon and the Riders with him could help Wen come to terms with the fact that the King's death was not her fault, and to show her that she has much to offer and can find a permanent place of service and love. Characters Senneth Brassenthwaite Senneth is a powerful mystic who specializes in the use of fire. She draws her power from the Bright Mother, or sun goddess. She is a former serramarra of the House of Brassenthwaite, but was expelled by her father at the age of seventeen after he killed her newborn illegitimate son in a fit of rage. After leaving her home, she wandered Gillengaria and eventually crossed into the Lirrens. She was adopted by one of the sebahta and had to declare herself bahta-lo to prevent herself from being married off by her well-intentioned adopted family. She went to Danalustrous to act as tutor to Kirra and Donnal for a few years, and began to serve the king. She later went back to Brassenthwaite to reconcile with her brothers.

His father and grandfather were Riders before him, and he never doubted his desired career. He is very quiet and solemn most of the time, and is an excellent warrior. He fell in love with Senneth despite their differences in rank and privilege, and they eventually marry. Kirra Danalustrous Kirra is a stunningly beautiful serramarra who possesses the ability to shape-shift and heal. When she was young she learned about a young mystic like herself living in a village within Danalustrous and summoned him to live with her in Danan Hall. This mystic is Donnal, and from then on he becomes unwaveringly loyal to her. Kirra is very close to her father and younger sister, Casserah, but is constantly restless in contrast to their homebodyness. She tours Gillangaria disguised as Casserra and begins an affair with the regent Romar. She later leaves Romar and takes away his knowledge of their love for each other. After she leaves Romar forever, she realizes she loves Donnal. Donnal Donnal is Kirra's companion and protector. He loves her and is completely loyal to her. He also possesses the ability to shape shift. Justin Justin is the son of a prostitute who died when he was ten. He spent his youth learning to fight and steal, when one day he tried to rob Tayse. Instead of killing him, the older man took Justin back to the palace and trained him as a King's Rider. As a result, Justin is unswervingly loyal to Tayse and the king. He first meets Ellynor when she is molested on the streets by a low-ranking nobleman and he saves her. They begin to meet in secret and soon fall in love. He is attacked on the way home from visiting her and she saves his life with her healing powers. Cammon Cammon has the ability to sense the emotions and intentions of others. He is also able to enhance the powers of other mystics and can communicate with people over long distances. He also has the ability to heal people's emotional trauma. (This is discovered in Reader and Raelynx after King Baryn dies) He has lived outside Gillengaria with his parents who traveled between several countries. His family never lived in one place for long (The longest stay anywhere was only several months). He cites the fact that his parents did not pay much attention to him growing up and the constant moving to his loneliness. His father died when he was nineteen. After his father died, his mother arranged travel back to Gillengaria on a ship. To pay for the trip she arranged to work in the kitchens. She died on the trip back. As he had no money and his mother had died, the Ship's Captain indentured him to a tavernkeeper. The tavernkeeper recognized him as a mystic and being a follower of the Pale Mother he put a slave collar and moonstone on him. This restricted his powers and burned him. He stayed there until he was rescued by Senneth's group. Eventually, Princess Amalie and Cammon fall in love. Their friends invent a fictitious ancestry for Cammon, which allows them to marry. Ellynor Ellynor is a native Lirren girl who comes to the Lumanen Convent to watch over her flighty cousin, Rosurie. She discovers she is a mystic and flees with Justin. She decides to declare herself bahta-lo so she can marry Justin. She returns to Gillengaria and is instrumental in winning the war. Princess Amalie Princess Amalie is the daughter of King Baryn and his late wife. She shows an astonishing amount of calm and lack of fear. She is rather na√Øve, having lived in the palace her whole life. She is a mystic. Minor characters *King Baryn ‚Äì The aging king of Gillengaria.

The Russo-European Laika itself dates to a breeding program begun in 1944 by E. I. Shereshevsky of the All-Union Research Institute for the Hunting Industry, in Kalinin (now Tver) Province.  Breed recognition  The Russo- European Laika is recognized by the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale in the Spitz and Primitive types/Section 2: Nordic Hunting Dogs Group. The breed is listed as breed number 304, along with two other Russian dogs, breed number 305, the East Siberian L√°ƒ≠ka and breed number 306, the West Siberian L√°ƒ≠ka.  Breed standard  The Russo-European Laika is described as being of medium size, males being about at the withers and females about . The breed has prick ears and a sickle tail carried over the back. Temperament should be non aggressive. Colour can be any of the normal Spitz-type colours, but red and ticking on the legs is undesirable.Download F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale standard from this page: Temperament This is a lively breed that enjoys time spent in the great outdoors. As a hunter who frequently trees game, the Russo-European Laika uses its voice to alert the hunter to the treed prey (typically a raccoon or squirrel). The Russo-European Laika is also one of the best dogs for duck hunting. It may use its voice freely in the house as well because it is easily excited about things going on around it. The Russo-European Laika has a strong love of family. Once bonded to them, it is quite territorial and makes an excellent guard dog. It is extremely tolerant of children, although not of strangers or other unfamiliar dogs. Eager to please and with energy to spare, the Russo-European Laika benefits tremendously from training of any kind. Socialization must begin in puppyhood and continue throughout its life. Obedience classes or participation in a working association will give it a sense of purpose and the frequent exercise it requires. With those opportunities, it will learn quickly and become well balanced as a family dog. Exercise An energetic and keen dog, the Russo- European Laika needs plenty of exercise; opportunities to run free and hunt are best. Without enough to do, it suffers from boredom and can become destructive.

It is a half-timbered (bindingsv√¶rk) castle built by King Christian III from 1539 to around 1555 initially as a fortification. A building had existed at the site before Christian III's castle. It stood south of the castle and is mentioned in the first documentation of Aalborghus, dating back to 1340. It was owned by Margrethe I and was the death place of King Hans in 1513 who died in a horse riding accident. The castle Aalborghus in Aalborg, Denmark was built between 1539 and 1555. King Frederik I had originally intended to destroy the initial building around 1530 and moving to a different site to convert Aalborg's Franciscan monastery into a castle. However he left the decision to his son Christian III, who later decided to demolish the original in 1539 and contracted the royal architect Morten Bussert to build a new fortified castle north of the old site, near the Limfjord. A barrier wall was built alongside the fjord, and later in 1633, King Christian IV built a north wing facing the port, which was used as a granary for the storage of food supplies such as grain. A western wing was built to the same effect later, holding other supplies such as meats and fish. The south-facing wing was created between 1808 and 1809 but all that remains today of the original castle is the east wing. Between 1954 and 1964 the old granaries underwent full renovation by the Royal Inspector of Listed Buildings, Leopold Teschl, who converted them into council offices.

The 'Poet' is dub poet Johnson and 'the Roots' are Dennis Bovell, Lloyd \\"Jah Bunny\\" Donaldson, Desmond Craig, Winston Curniffe, Everald Forrest, Floyd Lawson, John Varnom, Lila Weathers and Vivian Weathers. Most of the tracks are based on poems that first appeared in Johnson's 1975 book of poetry Dread Beat an' Blood. This album was the result of collaboration between Johnson, who had been active as a journalist and reggae critic as well as a poet, and musician and producer Bovell. The combination of Bovell's heavy dub rhythms and Johnson's monotone intonation of his poetry created a whole new genre of reggae: dub poetry. In subsequent re-releases of the album the artist is sometimes given as Linton Kwesi Johnson.

The church was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1979 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. It is now known as Spirit of Hope. History The Epiphany Reformed Episcopal parish was founded in 1878 as a place where Anglicans not pledged to the Episcopal bishop of Michigan might worship.Trinity Episcopal Church/ Spirit of Hope from Detroit1701.org In 1880, the congregation built a small frame church, and in 1889 changed their name to Trinity Episcopal. James E. Scripps, owner of The Detroit News, was a member of the Trinity congregation. Scripps was born in London, and developed a fascination with historic English churches. He commissioned sketches of churches in England, and in 1893 put up $55,000 to build the current church building.Historic Building from Spirit of Hope In 1896, Trinity members voted to unite their church with the Episcopal diocese of Michigan. In 1926, the parish house, which includes a chapel, dining room, gymnasium, offices and classrooms was constructed. As the neighborhood around Trinity changed, the church reached out to new constituents, including the Irish community.History from Spirit of Hope However, the declining population of the surrounding area led to a decline in the congregation. In 2001, the nearby Jeffries Housing Projects were torn down; the Faith Memorial Lutheran Church, founded in 1956 to serve the community, found itself with a drastically reduced congregation. The congregations of Faith Memorial Lutheran and Trinity Episcopal began exploring the concept of merging, and in April 2006, the two joined to become the Spirit of Hope. In 2007, Kathleen Brennan began the Spirit of Hope Urban Farm which was featured in the September/October 2011 Natural Home & Garden magazine.Greening Detroit: Spirit of Hope Urban Farm Brings Bounty to the Motor City, Kelli B. Kavanaugh, Natural Home & Garden, September/October 2011 (retrieved 28 January 2012) Detail of the exterior Architecture James E. Scripps commissioned architects Mason & Rice to design this English Gothic- style church. The floorplan of Trinity Episcopal Church is laid out in a cruciform pattern. The walls are two feet thick Trenton limestone, and the root is sheathed with copper. Smooth brown limestone used as trim offsets the white limestone used for the bulk of the walls. The central, supported by stone arches and buttresses, tower contains ten bells. The exterior holds over two hundred carvings, including gargoyles that serve as water drains. Inside the sanctuary, ten stone angels supporting the nave beams face inward; several windows contain stained glass, including a Tiffany, a LaFarge, and a window over the altar was created by Franz Mayer & Co. of Germany. A 1200-pipe organ manufactured by the Jardine Company of New York City is also inside.

Of these, 51 (the so-called T3a) corresponded to the older version of the Prussian T 3 with a regulator on top. The other 17 (the T3b) conformed to the more powerful version with a steam dome. Two of the latter locomotives were given a Walschaerts valve gear instead of the usual Allan valve gear. They were employed primarily on branch line and shunting duties.

This is distinct from a dual mandate prohibition, where a person has to resign from their old office to the new office, rather than to the new office. Resign-to-run laws exist in several jurisdictions, including five US states. Arguments for and against Supporters of resign-to-run laws argue that a politician running for one office while holding another might neglect the duties of their current office, since they spend much of their time campaigning for the new office. They also believe that in a race between someone who currently holds another office and someone who doesn't, the person who holds another office can unfairly use their incumbency as leverage in the campaign, for example by funneling official resources into the campaign or by using their office as a fallback in case they lose the race. An officeholder who wants to run for higher office may time their run to complete their tasks in their current office. An example of this is Rodney Glassman, 2010 candidate for U.S. Senate from Arizona, who delayed his formal announcement until the city's budget was completed.http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/valleyfever/2010/02/rodney_glassman_the_sole_poten.php Opponents say that resign-to-run laws are likely to harm people who have public service as a job, since these people might not be in a good enough financial position to resign from their current office if they want to run for another office. People who want to hold a particular office might also be dissuaded from running for lower offices beforehand, as holding lower offices would block them from running for their desired office and serve as a hindrance instead of a stepping stone. Examples United States =Arizona= Section 38-296 of the Arizona Revised Statutes, entitled \\"Limitation upon filing for election by incumbent of elective office\\" states: 1. Except during the final year of the term being served, no incumbent of a salaried elective office, whether holding by election or appointment, may offer himself for nomination or election to any salaried local, state or federal office. 2. An incumbent of a salaried elected office shall be deemed to have offered himself for nomination or election to a salaried local, state or federal office on the filing of a nomination paper pursuant to section 16-311, subsection A. An incumbent of a salaried elected office is not deemed to have offered himself for nomination or election to an office by making a formal declaration of candidacy for the office. *Note: Changes passed by the legislature in 2013 allow elected officials to publicly announce their candidacy for another office. Previously, they had to hide their intentions from voters, as they would have had to resign upon formally announcing candidacy for a different office. Now they do not have to resign their current office unless they file formal nominating papers and are not in their final year of office. The text above reflects these changes. =Florida= Section 99.012 of the Florida Statutes states: \\"No officer may qualify as a candidate for another public office, whether state, district, county or municipal, if the terms or any part thereof run concurrently with each other, without resigning from the office he or she presently holds.\\" The Florida law permits an office-holder to make their resignation effective the day they would assume the new office if elected. In 1970, the US District Court for the Northern District of Florida ruled that Florida's resign-to-run law could not be applied to candidates running for Congress. The court found that the law violated Article 1, Section 2, Clause 2, of the Constitution by providing an additional qualification not provided by the Constitution for election to Congress. That same year, in a separate case, Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black questioned the constitutionality of the same statute. =Georgia= Article II, Section 2, Paragraph V of the 1983 Constitution of Georgia reads: \\"The office of any state, county, or municipal elected official shall be declared vacant upon such elected official qualifying, in a general primary or general election, or special primary or special election, for another state, county, or municipal elective office or qualifying for the House of Representatives or the Senate of the United States if the term of the office for which such official is qualifying for begins more than 30 days prior to the expiration of such official's present term of office.\\" =Hawaii= In 1978, Article II, Section 7 was added to the Constitution of Hawaii to include resign-to-run: \\"Any elected public officer shall resign from that office before being eligible as a candidate for another public office, if the term of the office sought begins before the end of the term of the office held.\\" =Texas= Article 16, Section 65(b) of the Constitution of Texas states: \\"If any of the officers named herein shall announce their candidacy, or shall in fact become a candidate, in any General, Special or Primary Election, for any office of profit or trust under the laws of this State or the United States other than the office then held, at any time when the unexpired term of the office then held shall exceed one year and 30 days, such announcement or such candidacy shall constitute an automatic resignation of the office then held, and the vacancy thereby created shall be filled pursuant to law in the same manner as other vacancies for such office are filled.\\" The \\"officers named herein\\" are listed in Article 16, Section 65(a): *District Clerks *County Clerks *County Judges *Judges of the County Courts at Law *Judges of the County Criminal Courts *Judges of the County Probate Courts *Judges of the County Domestic Relations Courts *County Treasurers *Criminal District Attorneys *County Surveyors *County Commissioners *Justices of the Peace *Sheriffs *Assessors and Collectors of Taxes *District Attorneys *County Attorneys *Public Weighers *Constables Tex.

It was based on the eponymous novel by Erik Neutsch and starred Manfred Krug in the main role. After its release, the film was shown only for a few days, before being shelved due to conflicts with the Socialist Unity Party, the ruling communist party in the German Democratic Republic. Only after 23 years was the film shown again, in November 1989. Plot synopsis The film takes place at a fictional petrochemical plant. There were very disorganized working conditions caused by incompetent officials, faulty plans, material deficits and delinquent behavior. One of the main characters, Hannes Balla (Manfred Krug), works on the plant and is seen as the masculine head of his crew, the Ballas. He and his crew are delinquent and often steal materials from other groups of workers to finish their own projects. Balla is seen as an uncooperative, but talented carpenter. In one of the films' famous scenes, the Ballas skinny dip in the duck pond in a nearby town and a police officer instructs them to get out. The Ballas instead pull the officer into the pond with them. This blatant disregard for authority was one of the main problems at the plant. The Socialist Party (SED) sends a married secretary Werner Horrath to oversee the plant and tame Balla's delinquent actions. Around the same time, Kati Klee (Krystyna Stypu≈Çkowska) arrives at the plant as an engineer who is first discouraged from working in an all-male environment. Balla doesn't like the Party control and in one important scene, Balla and Horrath play an aggressive clapping game, which eventually results in Horrath being pushed to the ground. Klee sees this and ultimately chooses Horrath to have a relationship with, though Balla has also been pursuing her. The three characters develop a love triangle against the backdrop of Socialist Party politics and the pressure of completing the construction of the plant on time. One of the main themes of the film is the problems that face the plant under socialist rule and how each character is affected by the Party's morals. The romance between Klee and Horrath, which flies in the face of Party dictates, whose turning point occurs when Klee becomes pregnant by Horrath. The pregnancy causes turmoil in the Party and results in the Party trying to clean its ranks of the \\"morally defective.\\" An executive meeting is held to review Horrath. They discuss his contributions to the plant as well as his promiscuous personal life. In the end, Klee and Horrath end their relationship and Horrath loses his rank in the Party and his job. Klee leaves the plant, realizing the negative effect that its environment had on her. Balla, who has matured greatly since the beginning of the film, has become a much more disciplined socialist citizen. He accepts his role in the party. Socialism is both criticized and praised in the end of the film.

Bertolt Brecht Library, East Berlin, 27 November 1964. The film version of Trace of Stones was based on the novel of the same name by writer Erik Neutsch. The novel was celebrated by the Socialist Unity Party (SED) of East Germany, and production of the film was expected to be free of the normal interference normally subjected to DEFA by the SED. Since the novel was 900 pages, some major alterations would need to be made to the story in order to make a film of reasonable length. Initial screenings of the working print were attacked by high-ranking officials of the SED, much to the surprise of director Frank Beyer. They took issue with the portrayal of \\"The Party\\" in the film. While socialism is celebrated by the film, the party's role in it was viewed as neutral. The SED wanted their portrayal in the film to be one of a proactive agent of socialism. The SED, in an effort to create the illusion of studio autonomy, gave the film over to DEFA's internal approval process. It was approved, and the SED reluctantly allowed for distribution of the film.  DEFA film studio  DEFA was first talked about during a meeting held after World War II within the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in January 1945. This meeting was to discuss the creation of a new anti-fascist culture while integrating the ideas of the KPD. After this meeting, the Soviet Military Administration in Germany (SMAD), the highest authority in the Soviet zone, wanted to establish a new film production company connected to the government and DEFA was founded on this basis.DEFA- Foundation- DEFA Facts and Dates.\\" http://www.defa-stiftung.de In Trace of Stones, cultural officials demanded to that the duck pond scene be cut, is it was suggested, an underlying political agenda against the GDR state. This type of censorship was common since DEFA was a state-funded and controlled film studio which had to abide by the demands of the government at that time. The script of the film was negotiated extensively by the Film Bureau and Central Committee. Beyer submitted a list of changes that moderated the controversial scenes (most of them included the character Balla). Many of the changes weren't carried out in the film, although still much of the film is censored from the original.Manfred Krug and Egon Krenz in the premier of the newly approved Trace of Stones. East Berlin, 23 November 1989.  11th Plenum  During East German film history, there were significant shifts in periods of liberalization and restriction. One significant shift from restrictive to liberal film making was in 1961 when the Berlin Wall was built, four years later restrictions were imposed due to the Eleventh Plenum. Film makers worked on projects that was accepted during a less restrictive cultural period, and then a whole year's worth of films were banned due to the Eleventh Plenum. The Eleventh Plenum was decided during a meeting to discuss economic policy, but ended up restricting the liberal expression in culture, particularly in the film industry. In 1965, eleven films were either banned or stopped production in DEFA. These films were banned in 1965 and weren't available to be shown until 1990. They were called the \\"Rabbit films\\" since the film The Rabbit is Me directed by Kurt Maetzig was one of the films banned. The film industry seemed to have lost its influence on culture. Before the eleventh plenum, film was an important platform to share socialist culture and debate social issues. A lot of art created during this time was state supported and expressed issues that were considered frowned upon in film beforehand.  Reception  Some high-ranking cultural official in the parties including Alexander Abusch, Kurt Hager, and Hans Rodenberg said, \\"The role of the party as a battle group as a unified revolutionary force is pressed too strongly into the background. This happens. . . [because] the problem of the moral behavior of the party secretary comes to the fore . . . The party actually appears as an inquisitional force\\" Additionally, other officials disagreed with the film's neutral attitude towards socialism.Aussprache zum Film \\"Spur der Steine\\" in der Hauptverwaltung Film . . . am 11. Marz 1966, 7-8, SAPMO DY30/IVA2/2024/36  Film Aftermath  After the film was banned due to the Eleventh Plenum, the director Beyer was called upon by Party executives at DEFA for a discussion to decide whether his film Trace of Stones was harmful to the Party image. The Party declared that the film conflicted with the Party line and demanded Beyer issue an apology and self criticism. Beyer didn't apologize for his actions and therefore did not continue working in the East German Film Industry for years. It wasn't until ten years later did Beyer release a new film Jacob the Liar. The actor Manfred Krug was one of East Germany's film stars. He became popular through his roles in comedy and action movies as well as for his jazz music. Much of his works was associated with western culture‚Äì a noticeable problem for the government. He also had a large youth following but he was also known for his outspokenness and neutral attitude toward socialism. In the film, Krug's character Balla was very outspoken, at first, about how socialism wasn't helping the success on the plant. He was going against the party line in his work and party officials thought they could use a smear campaign to make Krug more obedient with the party. Additionally, he had military views that were controversial and the Culture Department declared that \\"an actor that could not be relied upon to support the proper standpoint on the defense of the GDR offscreen was clearly a rather poor candidate to play such a prominent political figure on it\\" and Krug ended up leaving East Germany for West Germany in 1976.

Preparation It is prepared by heating tetraphenylcyclopentadienone and diphenylacetylene in benzophenone or other high-temperature solvent. The reaction proceeds via a Diels-Alder reaction to give the hexaphenyldienone, which then eliminates carbon monoxide. :Hexaphenylbenzene synthesis Together with 1,2,3,4-tetraphenylnaphthalene, hexaphenylbenzene forms by the chromium-catalyzed oligomerization of diphenylacetylene.

Earlier work demonstrated a relationship between galaxy luminosity and black hole mass, which nowadays has a comparable level of scatter.Savorgnan, Giulia A. D.; Graham, Alister W. (2015), Overmassive black holes in the MBH-œÉ diagram do not belong to over (dry) merged galaxiesGiulia A.D. Savorgnan, et al. (2016), Supermassive Black Holes and Their Host Spheroids. II. The Red and Blue Sequence in the MBH-M*,sph Diagram The M‚ÄìœÉ relation is generally interpreted as implying some source of mechanical feedback between the growth of supermassive black holes and the growth of galaxy bulges, although the source of this feedback is still uncertain. Discovery of the M‚ÄìœÉ relation was taken by many astronomers to imply that supermassive black holes are fundamental components of galaxies. Prior to about 2000, the main concern had been the simple detection of black holes, while afterward the interest changed to understanding the role of supermassive black holes as a critical component of galaxies. This led to the main uses of the relation to estimate black hole masses in galaxies that are too distant for direct mass measurements to be made, and to assay the overall black hole content of the Universe. Origin The tightness of the M‚ÄìœÉ relation suggests that some kind of feedback acts to maintain the connection between black hole mass and stellar velocity dispersion, in spite of processes like galaxy mergers and gas accretion that might be expected to increase the scatter over time. One such mechanism was suggested by Joseph Silk and Martin Rees in 1998.Silk, J. and Rees, M. (1998), Quasars and galaxy formation, Astronomy and Astrophysics, 331, L1‚ÄìL4 These authors proposed a model in which supermassive black holes first form via collapse of giant gas clouds before most of the bulge mass has turned into stars. The black holes created in this way would then accrete and radiate, driving a wind which acts back on the accretion flow. The flow would stall if the rate of deposition of mechanical energy into the infalling gas was large enough to unbind the protogalaxy in one crossing time. The Silk and Rees model predicts a slope for the M‚ÄìœÉ relation of , which is approximately correct. However, the predicted normalization of the relation is too small by about a factor of one thousand. The reason is that there is far more energy released in the formation of a supermassive black hole than is needed to completely unbind the stellar bulge. A more successful feedback model was first presented by Andrew King at the University of Leicester in 2003. In King's model, feedback occurs through momentum transfer, rather than energy transfer as in the case of Silk & Rees's model. A \\"momentum-driven flow\\" is one in which the gas cooling time is so short that essentially all the energy in the flow is in the form of bulk motion. In such a flow, most of the energy released by the black hole is lost to radiation, and only a few percent is left to affect the gas mechanically. King's model predicts a slope of for the M‚ÄìœÉ relation, and the normalization is exactly correct; it is roughly a factor times larger than in Silk & Rees's relation. Importance Before the M‚ÄìœÉ relation was discovered in 2000, a large discrepancy existed between black hole masses derived using three techniques.Merritt, D. and Ferrarese, L. (2001), Relationship of Black Holes to Bulges Direct, or dynamical, measurements based on the motion of stars or gas near the black hole seemed to give masses that averaged ‚âà1% of the bulge mass (the \\"Magorrian relation\\"). Two other techniques‚Äîreverberation mapping in active galactic nuclei, and the So≈Çtan argument, which computes the cosmological density in black holes needed to explain the quasar light‚Äîboth gave a mean value of M/Mbulge that was a factor ‚âà10 smaller than implied by the Magorrian relation. The M‚ÄìœÉ relation resolved this discrepancy by showing that most of the direct black hole masses published prior to 2000 were significantly in error, presumably because the data on which they were based were of insufficient quality to resolve the black hole's dynamical sphere of influence. The mean ratio of black hole mass to bulge mass in big early-type galaxies is now believed to be approximately , and increasingly smaller as one moves to less massive galaxies. A common use of the M‚ÄìœÉ relation is to estimate black hole masses in distant galaxies using the easily measured quantity œÉ. Black hole masses in thousands of galaxies have been estimated in this way. The M‚ÄìœÉ relation is also used to calibrate so-called secondary and tertiary mass estimators, which relate the black hole mass to the strength of emission lines from hot gas in the nucleus or to the velocity dispersion of gas in the bulge.Peterson, B. (2008), The central black hole and relationships with the host galaxy, New Astronomy Reviews, 52, 240‚Äì252 The tightness of the M‚ÄìœÉ relation has led to suggestions that every bulge must contain a supermassive black hole. However, the number of galaxies in which the effect of the black hole's gravity on the motion of stars or gas is unambiguously seen is still quite small. It is unclear whether the lack of black hole detections in many galaxies implies that these galaxies do not contain black holes; or that their masses are significantly below the value implied by the M‚ÄìœÉ relation; or that the data are simply too poor to reveal the presence of the black hole.Valluri, M. et al. (2004), Difficulties with Recovering the Masses of Supermassive Black Holes from Stellar Kinematical Data, The Astrophysical Journal, 602, 66‚Äì92 The smallest supermassive black hole with a well-determined mass has . The existence of black holes in the mass range (\\"intermediate-mass black holes\\") is predicted by the M‚ÄìœÉ relation in low-mass galaxies, and the existence of intermediate-mass black holes has been reasonably well established in a number of galaxies that contain active galactic nuclei, although the values of Mbh in these galaxies are very uncertain.Ho, L. (2008), Nuclear activity in nearby galaxies, Annual Review of Astronomy & Astrophysics, 46, 475‚Äì539 No clear evidence has been found for ultra-massive black holes with masses above , although this may be an expected consequence of the observed upper limit to œÉ.Batcheldor, D. et al.

He established a successful practice as a wedding and portrait photographer, but is best known for his images of south Louisiana's rugged outdoors, and its fishermen and swamp dwellers. Early Cajun Images Fonville was born on in Mexico, Missouri and spent part of his childhood in Fort Worth, Texas, where, as a senior in high school, he purchased his first camera, a Kodak 3A model. Armed with this camera, Fonville shortly won $15 in a photography contest, which stirred his interest in pursuing photography as a career. In 1928, Fonville moved to Louisiana to work in construction, and it was during this time that he fell in love with the state. Fonville began photographing the state's southern swamps and grassy coastal wetlands, as well as the people who inhabited them, most notably the Cajuns. \\"Louisiana was my Africa, my South America,\\" he recalled.Ruth Laney, \\"Fonville's LSU,\\" LSU Magazine, September 1987, n.p., accessed 2010-12-27 Fonville's timing was fortuitous, for as Ben Forkner noted, \\"Thanks to an absence of roads and bridges, and to a largely inward-turned and jealous identity, the Cajun settlements and outposts that Fonville found were irregular islands of a predominantly French-speaking culture that continued to resist the tidal floods of 'progress' and the 20th century. . . . [W]hen Fonville appeared with his boat and camera the more remote strongholds of Cajun society could still give the impression of a private country at home in the midst of millennial swamp forests and endless river prairies, and only half-open to the modern world.\\"The Fonville Winans Studio is being nominated to the National Register, Louisiana Department of Culture, Recreation and Tourism, accessed 2009-01-20. Anne Price has observed that Fonville's photographs from this period were a \\"human, cheerful record of a people who were self-sufficient enough to make their own way with dignity despite the times, . . . Fishermen, hunters, moss gatherers and other wetlands residents are seen at work and at play. His landscapes and seascapes are haunting and enduring, and his always accurate eye captures the essence of time and place.\\" Fonville himself recalled of these images, \\"I didn‚Äôt take any of these pictures deliberately. I just took them for fun. None was on assignment. I wasn‚Äôt even a freelancer. I just took my camera and got pictures when I saw something interesting.\\" Later career In 1934 he became a student at Louisiana State University, where he majored in journalism and performed in the school's brass choir. He often photographed on LSU campus and had images published in the Reveille student newspaper and in the school's yearbook, Gumbo. Around 1940 Fonville opened his own photography studio in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. \\"I had a side porch I covered with tar paper,\\" he recalled, \\"and made into a darkroom. I used my bathroom for plumbing fixtures. I used the dining room to make portraits. I photographed several important people, and word got around pretty fast.\\" Fonville's wife did classic make-up for the subjects. Fonville photographed LSU student Joanne Woodward. He advised female subjects to wear a white, high necked, top, which he found more flattering. Fonville typically offered his subjects a drink to help them relax. Eventually he established a solid reputation as a wedding and studio portrait photographer, capturing images of local beauties and state politicians. Yet Fonville became best known for his images of south Louisiana's rugged outdoors, as well as its fishermen and swamp dwellers. Fonville rode a bicycle and, in later years, he hosted challenging Sunday brunch/bicycle tours of Baton Rouge. In 1991, Marval Editions published Cajun: Fonville Winans by Ben Forkner. This was the first major collection of Winans, leading to a Paris exhibit of his works and a visit to France by the photographer later that same year. Fonville Winans died in Louisiana on September 13, 1992. Legacy A portion of Fonville's work is stored in Hill Memorial Library, located on the campus of Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. In 1995, LSU Press issued Fonville Winans' Louisiana: Politics, People, and Places, a collection of over one hundred images by Fonville with a foreword by Louisiana politico James Carville and an afterword by noted contemporary Louisiana photographer C.C.

History Shim Gum Do emerged from the enlightenment of the monk Won Gwang, born as Chang Sik Kim, during a 100-day meditation and prayer retreat at Hwagyesa temple in Seoul, South Korea, in 1965. In 1971, Kim Changsik established the Korean Shim Gum Do Association and began teaching Shim Gum Do in South Korea. He moved to the United States in 1974, and, in 1978 he established American Buddhist Shim Gum Do Association. The main temple, Shim Gwang Sa, was built in Boston, Massachusetts. The World Shim Gum Do Association was established there as the world's center of Shim Gum Do Associations. The central component of the system is a series of 330 forms (choreographed sequences of techniques) using the sword. The system also includes forms using two swords, a long staff, a short staff, and empty hands, as well as a series of 3000 self-defense techniques called Ho Shin Sul. Shim Gum Do schools have existed in Italy, Japan, Poland, France, and Norway. The headquarters of the World Shim Gum Do Association as well as the American Buddhist Shim Gum Do Association is Shim Gwang Sa temple located in Brighton, Massachusetts.  Training  From the time of Kim‚Äôs enlightenment, training in Shim Gum Do sword techniques has focused on the use of a wooden practice sword, commonly called a mokgum in Korean. After achieving the rank of black belt, Shim Gum Do sword students may use a Korean style steel sword, which has a single-edged blade and is closely related to the Chinese Tang dynasty single-edge swords or the Japanese katana. Shim Gum Do sword training is organized as a progression of several series of forms. New students learn a series of basic forms and then move onto beginning defense forms before attaining their yellow belt. After learning 15 of these forms, a student may test for a first dan (degree) black belt. Progression may continue through the beginning attack series and on through 14 different series of sword forms. In addition to sword forms, students may learn up to 330 empty-handed forms called Shin Boep (\\"body dharma\\"). Advanced students may study Ssang Gum Boep (\\"two-sword dharma\\"), Dan Bong Sul (\\"short staff art\\"), or Jang Bong Sul (\\"long staff art\\"), consisting of 50 forms each.  Philosophy  Although the physical techniques of Shim Gum Do are intended by Chang Sik Kim to be effective fighting techniques, Chang Sik Kim teaches that the foundation of a clear mind and harmony between mind and body‚Äôs action is the most important thing a person can learn for defense. He argues that this ideal makes Shim Gum Do a non-violent martial art. In fact, spiritual aspects are highly emphasized in this martial art. It is typically practiced in spaces set up as Buddhist sanctuaries, and students have frequent opportunities for sitting in meditation and receiving dharma instruction.

The film was directed by George Nicholls, Jr. and based upon a Bret Harte novel. It is a remake of the 1918 film M'liss starring Mary Pickford in the title role. Plot M'Liss is an innocent but rambunctious 17-year-old girl who was born and raised in the small town of Smith's Pocket. Her father Washoe Smith, whose briefly productive mining claim was both the source of the town's name and the reason for its existence, is now known among the people as the town drunk. M'Liss has to take care of him and works in a saloon washing glasses. They lose their home when Mayor Morpher demands it as the location of the new school. New school master Stephen Thorne encourages M'Liss to leave the saloon and go to school. Her father is shot and killed while intervening in a saloon brawl. The now orphaned M'Liss is left in the guardianship of her father's friends, gambler Lou Ellis and the town barber Alf Edwards. When the mayor's wife Delia disapproves of M'Liss and tries to have her placed in an orphanage, M'Liss decides to leave Smith's Pocket. Stephen kisses M'Liss to persuade her not to run away. Told that a kiss is tantamount to a proposal of marriage, M'Liss is confused about what marriage is and asks for advice from heart-of-gold saloon girl Rose. The Morphers' ne'er-do-well city cousin, Jack Farlan, drunkenly tries to take advantage of M'Liss but is rescued by Stephen. When he refuses to duel Farlan with pistols, because he is a crack shot and would have the advantage over the intoxicated Farlan, Stephen is accused by the townspeople of cowardice. Late that night Farlan is shot and Stephen is accused, although in fact it was Lou who shot him. Assuming that Farlan will die, the town prepares to lynch Stephen, but Farlan recovers and Lou admits shooting him. Stephen proposes marriage to M'Liss and her guardians happily give their blessing.

The film is based on the Dutch television series Dunya en Desie (Dunya and Desie), which aired in three series from 2002 to 2004, about the friendship between two Dutch teenage girls. The film was chosen as the Netherlands' official submission to the 81st Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film. It has received the Golden Film, a film award recognizing domestic box office achievements in the Netherlands.

Dunya is of Moroccan ancestry, but was born in the Netherlands. She narrates the film, and begins by noting how Desie juggles multiple boyfriends. As a surprise birthday present for Dunya, Desie arranges for a driving lesson with a boyfriend, Pim. Dunya's parents generally object to Desie's behaviour. Desie works as a hairdresser and is also involved with her boss, Mike. However, in a moment of anger at Mike, she quits her job. When Desie misses her period, she gets a home pregnancy test, and it comes up positive. She thinks that Pim is the father. She learns from her mother, Monique Koppenol, that she was the result of an unplanned pregnancy when her mother was young. Her father abandoned them both soon after Desie was born, and moved to Morocco. Desie contemplates having an abortion and gets a referral, but at the last moment decides not to have an abortion. On her 18th birthday, Dunya hears that she is to be married by arrangement to a cousin in Morocco. She and her family move to a new house in Morocco, which they find is uncompleted after they have arrived. Dunya sees her cousin to whom the marriage is to be arranged, and is not attracted to him at all. However, she sees a young man, Shamir, who is part of the house building crew, and finds him more attractive than her cousin. Desie digs up a secret \\"treasure chest\\" of personal items of interest to both her and Dunya. In it is the address in Morocco of her father, Hans Schakel. Desie decides to go to Morocco to track down her father. She surprises Dunya and her family when she arrives unannounced at their house in Morocco. During her brief stay with Dunya's family, she scandalises the family by her behaviour and her dress. Tension develops between Dunya and Desie, and ultimately Dunya decides to accompany Desie on her search for her father, as she feels that Desie will not survive alone in Morocco. The two of them travel to Casablanca and into rural Morocco to search for Desie's father. They suffer the loss of Desie's luggage to two street con-men, and spend one evening in a Casablanca hospital after Desie shows signs of bleeding from the pregnancy. They learn that Desie's father did work in the city at the docks, but left that job years earlier and opened a gasoline station and restaurant away from urban areas. They continue to have fights and almost split up, but eventually reconcile and keep on the search for Hans Schakel. In the meantime, Desie's mother and her boyfriend Jeff are concerned over Desie's disappearance, and travel to Morocco in search of her.

The founders were James and Gustav Lansburgh. The company was known initially for supplying the black crepe used for the funeral of President Abraham Lincoln.

The station broadcast on 98.5 MHz with an effective radiated power of 100,000 watts using an omnidirectional antenna (class C1). It had a classical music format. Licensed as one of the first standalone FM stations in Canada, the station's budget was so tight that it had only four employees (which was unusual at the time for a radio station), and it relied entirely on newspapers as a source for news bulletins. The station was plagued with serious technical and financial difficulties; listeners received the station with indifference. One consequence of the failure of CJRM-FM to succeed with its classical music format was that the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) rejected for decades new applications to open a private classical music station in Montreal.Suzanne Colpron. \\"Une licence pour imprimer de l'argent\\", La Presse, September 28, 1996.

Its best known instance is Germanic mysticism, which gave rise to occultism under the Third Reich. The idea of the nation as a divine entity was presented by Johann Gottlieb Fichte. National mysticism is closely related to Romantic nationalism, but goes beyond the expounding of romantic sentiment, to a mystical veneration of the nation as a transcendent truth. It often intersects with ethnic nationalism by pseudohistorical assertions about the origins of a given ethnicity. National mysticism is encountered in many nationalisms other than Germanic or Nazi mysticism and expresses itself in the use of occult, pseudoscientific, or pseudohistorical beliefs to back up nationalistic claims, often involving unrealistic notions of the antiquity of a nation (antiquity frenzy) or any national myth defended as \\"true\\" by pseudo-scholarly means. Notable instances of national mysticism include: * The Sun Language Theory in Pan-Turkism * Kurdish nationalists often make the claim that they are the descendants of the Medes Polish Sarmatism * Greek Epsilonism and Proto-Greeks theory (see also and List of Ancient Greek tribes) * Some branches of revisionist history theories of Bulgarians and Bulgaria (i.e. \\"Thracomania\\") and Macedonian nationalist history theories * Narratives on the origin of the Albanians in Albanian nationalism * The Croat Illyrian movement * Romanian Protochronism * Philippine Destiny * The Battle of Kosovo as the national myth in Serbian nationalismDescribed as national mysticism in Christian Kind, Der Wille zur Macht -Wie sich Milosevic zum Herrscher √ºber Serbien erhob NZZ Folio 06/99 * American Manifest Destiny * The Indigenous Aryans theory in Hindu nationalism * Currents of Tamil nationalism (as in Devaneya Pavanar) * Claims of interplanetary travel, possible existence of in-vitro fertilization and genetic engineering by ancient Indians (102nd Indian Science Congress) * Some currents of Armenian nationalism (see Armenia, Subartu and Sumer) * Currents of Russian nationalisme.g. Alexander Sokurow, www.faz.net; see also Arkaim. * Kabbalistic currents in religious ZionismMoshe Sharon, Studies in Modern Religions and Religious Movements and the Babi-Baha'i (2004), p. 77. * Swedish Gothicism * Hungarian Holy Crown Doctrine  See also  * Religion in national symbols  References  ","title":"National mysticism"},{"id":"19091684","title":"Modran"},{"id":"19091695","text":"Fles or FLES may refer to: * De Koninklijke Porceleyne Fles, Dutch earthenware factory * Language immersion, also known as Foreign Languages in Elementary Schools (FLES) program People Three generations of a Jewish-Dutch-American family: * Louis Fles, Dutch businessman and activist (father of Barthold Fles and George Fles) ** Barthold Fles, Dutch-American literary agent (son of Louis Fles) ** George Fles, Dutch victim of the Great Purge (son of Louis Fles, father of Michael John Fles) *** Michael John Fles, American poet and musician (son of George Fles) ","title":"Fles"},{"id":"19091699","text":"Hiram Burnham (1814 ‚Äì September 29, 1864) was an officer in the Union Army who commanded a regiment and then a brigade in the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War.

Early life and career Hiram Burnham was born in Narraguagus, later Cherryfield, Maine, in 1814. He formed and led a militia company as its captain in the Aroostook War of 1839.Munday, p. 17. He subsequently worked as a lumberman and owned a sawmill. Active in local politics, he held public office as a county commissioner and a coroner. Burnham is described as a burly man with a strong voice, able to make himself heard on a battlefield.Sommers, p. 38. He was born in Machias, Maine the son of John & Elizabeth (Libby) Burnham. He moved to Cherryfield in the early 1830s. Civil War Service in the Army of the Potomac Early in the war Burnham became lieutenant colonel of the 6th Maine Infantry on July 16, 1861. He was promoted to the rank of colonel on December 12 of that year. He served with the Army of the Potomac in the Peninsula Campaign, starting out in Brig. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock's brigade in a division of the IV Corps under Brig. Gen. William F. Smith. This division later became part of the VI Corps. At the Battle of Crampton's Gap and the Battle of Antietam, Burnham led his regiment in the 1st Brigade, 2nd Division, VI Corps under Hancock. He led the same regiment under Brig. Gen. Calvin E. Pratt at the Battle of Fredericksburg, where the brigade was only lightly engaged. In 1863, a \\"Light Division\\" of VI Corps, composed of five regiments, was organized under General Pratt. It was to be able to move rapidly. Instead of wagons, supplies were to be carried on mules.Parsons, p. 23. However, Pratt resigned his post and Burnham led the division from May 3 to May 11, including at the Second Battle of Fredericksburg, where he was wounded, temporarily relinquishing command.Winslow, pp. 73-74. The Light Division was among the first VI Corps units to cross the Rappahannock River on May 1, 1863 to draw Confederate attention away from the main crossing points of the Army of the Potomac upstream. The Light Division made up the rightmost column in Maj. Gen. John Sedgwick‚Äôs attack on Marye‚Äôs Heights on May 3. Although Burnham spoke \\"cheerfully\\" to his troops before they attacked, casualties were heavy ‚Äî an estimated 30%.Sears, pp. 352, 357. Parsons, p. 172 gives a figure of 808 casualties. Burnham's Light Division was the right flank anchor of Sedgwick's line when VI Corps stood on the defensive during the later stages of the Battle of Salem Church. Only lightly engaged, Burnham was able to send two regiments to help repel a Confederate attack on the left flank. The 6th Maine of Burnham's command was one of the rearguard units when the corps retreated across the Rappahannock River.Sears, pp. 424-25. The Light Division was dissolved after the Battle of Chancellorsville, and Burnham's regiment joined the 3rd Brigade, 1st Division, VI Corps under Brig. Gen. David Allen Russell.

Kierkegaard seems to have loved Regine but was unable to reconcile the prospect of marriage with his vocation as a writer and his passionate and introspective Christianity. A similar argument is found in Franz Kafka's journal entry titled \\"Summary of all the arguments for and against my marriage\\": > I must be alone a great deal. What I accomplished was only the result of > being alone.Kafka, Franz. Summary of all the arguments for and against my > marriage: From Kafka's Diaries, 12 July 1912... As a high-profile couple, Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir always expressed opposition to marriage. Brian Sawyer says \\"Marriage, understood existentially, proposes to join two free selves into one heading, thus denying the freedom, the complete foundation, of each self.\\" In response to the passage of California Proposition 22 and the current controversy regarding same-sex unions in the United States, a group of people have banded together to boycott marriage until all people can legally marry. The argument is that since marriage is not an inclusive institution of society, the members of the boycott refuse to support the institution as it exists. In the West, cohabitation and births outside marriage are becoming more common. In the United States, conservative and religious commentators are highly critical of this trend. They are also often critical of present-day marriage law and the ease of divorce. John Witte, Jr., Professor of Law and director of the Law and Religion Program at Emory University, argues that contemporary liberal attitudes toward marriage produce a family that is \\"haphazardly bound together in the common pursuit of selfish ends\\" exactly as prophesied by Nietzsche.Witte Jr., John (1997). From Sacrament to Contract: Marriage, Religion, and Law in the Western Tradition. Westminster John Knox Press. pp. 39‚Äì40. In his From Sacrament to Contract, Witte has argued that John Stuart Mill's secular and contractarian model of marriage, developed during the Enlightenment, provided the theoretical justification for the present-day transformation of Anglo-American marriage law, promoting unqualified \\"right to divorce\\" on plaintiff's demand, one-time division of property, and child custody without regard for marital misconduct. A Catholic professor Romano Cessario, in a review of Witte's book published in an ecumenical journal the First Things, suggested that a solution to the current crisis of marriage in the West, could come from the possible revival of the sacramental marriage among Christians, thus counterbalancing Nietzsche's pessimism (as echoed by Witte). Cultural criticisms \\"Esposas de Matrimonio\\" (\\"Wedding Cuffs\\"), a wedding ring sculpture expressing the criticism of marriages' effects on individual liberty. Esposas is a Spanish pun, in which the singular form of the word esposa refers to a spouse, and the plural refers to handcuffs. Male dominance Critics of marriage argue that it is an institution which contributes to the maintaining of traditional gender roles, thus preventing women from achieving social equality, and reinforcing the idea that women exist to serve men, which in turn increases the abuse of women. They argue that marriage reinforces the traditional paradigm of male-female interaction: subordination of the woman to the man in exchange of subsistence. According to Sheila Jeffreys \\"the traditional elements of marriage have not completely disappeared in western societies, even in the case of employed, highly educated and well paid professional women\\". She argues that even such women remain in abusive marriages out of fear of leaving and out of duty. Even in Western countries, married women \\"feel they have no choice but to stay and endure and may be 'loving to survive\\". Normalization and discrimination Some commentators criticize government authorities for promotion of marriage. They also criticize the romanticized image that marriage is given in films and romance novels. Over 40% of books sold in America were romance novels. Some critics argue that people cannot form an objective image of what marriage is if they are from early childhood indoctrinated into believing marriage is desirable and necessary.http://www.publiceye.org/jeans_report/marriage- promotion-part-2.pdf Critics of marriage argue that this institution represents a form of state sponsored discrimination, in a generalized way against people who do not marry, and in a particular way against certain racial or ethnic groups who are less likely to marry and more likely to have children outside marriage, such as African Americans in the US - by stigmatizing such individuals, presenting their lifestyle as abnormal and denying them rights. Dean Spade and Craig Willse write that: > The idea that married families and their children are superior was and > remains a key tool of anti-Black racism. Black families have consistently > been portrayed as pathological and criminal in academic research and social > policy based on marriage rates, most famously in the Moynihan Report. Social isolation A criticism of marriage is that it may lead to the social isolation of a person, who is often expected to diminish other relations with friends, relatives or colleagues, in order to be fully dedicated to their spouse. Julie Bindel writes that: \\"Maybe those at the most risk of ending up alone are not the folk who never marry, but rather the people who chuck all their eggs in one basket. [...] During their marriage, believing as they did that they only needed each other, both parties would have neglected friendships, or indeed, failed to cultivate new ones\\". Symbolism Some critics assert that marriage will always remain a symbolic institution signifying the subordination of women to men. Clare Chambers points to the sexist traditions surrounding marriage and weddings; she writes: > Symbolically, the white wedding asserts that women's ultimate dream and > purpose is to marry, and remains replete with sexist imagery: the white > dress denoting the bride's virginity (and emphasising the importance of her > appearance); the minister telling the husband \\"you may now kiss the bride\\" > (rather than the bride herself giving permission, or indeed initiating or at > least equally participating in the act of kissing); the reception at which, > traditionally, all the speeches are given by men; the wife surrendering her > own name and taking her husband's. The history of marriage in relation to women makes it an institution that some critics argue cannot and should not be accepted in the 21st century; to do so would mean to trivialize the abuses it was responsible for. Some critics argue that it is impossible to dissociate marriage from its past. Clare Chambers argues that: > (...) it is impossible to escape the history of the institution. Its status > as a tradition ties its current meaning to its past\\". Past abuses of > marriage are sometimes depicted in documentaries. A documentary in Ireland > presented the story of elderly women who described their experiences with > repeated acts of rape in marriage and the children born from these rapes, > during the time when marital rape was not criminalized, contraception, > abortion and divorce were all illegal, and the marriage bar restricting > married women's employment outside home was in force. Marital rape in > Ireland was made illegal in 1990, and divorce was legalized in 1996. Violence against women Violence related to female virginity is considered a problem. In many parts of the world it is socially expected for the bride to be a virgin; if the husband has sex with his wife after marriage and she does not bleed (it is common for a woman to not bleed when she has sex for the first time ), this can end in extreme violence, including an honor killing.https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/egm/vaw_legislation_2009/Expert%20Paper%20EGMGPLHP%20_Sherifa%20Zuhur%20-%20II_.pdf The common view of marital life as \\"private\\" and outside the sphere of public intervention allows violence to flourish. Elizabeth Brake writes that \\"\\"privacy\\" protects unequal divisions of domestic labor, domestic violence, and exclusion of health coverage for abortion and contraception.\\" Mary Lyndon Shanley writes that police often \\"ignore complaints of domestic violence because they do not want to \\"intrude\\" on the private realm of the married couple\\".[ Just Marriage, by Mary Lyndon Shanley, 2004] Legal criticisms Economic dependence Marriage has been criticized in its complicity of wives' economic dependence on husbands due to the gendered division of labour and that women's work typically pays less than men's work. Women are more likely to downgrade or drop out of their careers to assist in child rearing or when their career conflicts with their husband's. Absent a career, women become dependent on legally granted marriage benefits such as a husband's health insurance, and are thus increasingly dependent on their husband. This dependence can facilitate abuse because the marriage becomes economically difficult to leave. Immobility In some conservative cultures, married women are not allowed to leave home without the consent of the husband - a prohibition that is supported by the law itself in many of these countries. For instance, in Yemen marriage regulations state that a wife must obey her husband and must not leave home without his permission. Marital rape Historically, in many cultures marriage has been used to regulate sexuality, rather than consent regulating it. That is, non-marital sex was banned regardless of consent, while marital sex was an enforceable obligation. From the mid-20th century onward, changing social norms have led to, among other things, the decriminalization of consensual non-marital sex and the criminalization of marital rape. These changes are not universal around the world, and in many countries they have not occurred. One of the concerns about marriage is that it may contradict the notion of sexual self-determination, due to cultural, religious, and in many countries also legal norms. For instance, sex outside marriage is still punishable by death in some jurisdictions. In 2014, Amnesty International's Secretary General stated that \\"It is unbelievable that in the twenty-first century some countries are condoning child marriage and marital rape while others are outlawing abortion, sex outside marriage and same-sex sexual activity ‚Äì even punishable by death.\\" In various places, men have sexual authority over their wives, in law and in practice. The men decide when and where to have sex, and wives have no power to stop unwanted sex. In certain countries marital rape is legal, and even where it is illegal it is infrequently reported or prosecuted. Often, married women also cannot stop unwanted pregnancy, because in various countries modern contraception is not available, and in some countries married women need legal permission from the husband to use contraception (and even in countries where the husband's consent is not legally required in practice it is asked for), and abortion is illegal or restricted, and in some countries married women need the consent of husband for abortion. Therefore, marriage leads to a situation which allows not only forced sex, but also forced pregnancy, and in some of these countries pregnancy and childbirth remain dangerous because of lack of adequate medical care. The effects of sexual violence inside marriage are exacerbated by the practice of child marriage; in 2013 an 8-year-old Yemeni girl died from internal bleeding after she was raped by her 40-year-old new husband. Sheila Jeffreys argues that the very institution of marriage is based on the idea that heterosexual sex is the absolute right of the man and the absolute duty of the woman; that men are entitled to demand sex on their terms and to coerce sex, and women are not allowed to ever refuse it. Lack of economic opportunity means that wives have no choice but to \\"allow sexual access to their bodies in return for subsistence\\". Relationship favoritism Another issue is the question on why relations that are (or are believed to be) sexual are favored in law with regard to legal protections and promotion, and those that are not (or are believed not to be) are not. This is especially the case as marriage rates are quite low in many Western countries, and the state has been criticized for ingoing other living arrangements that are not sexual relations; and there have been increased objections to legal concepts such as consummation or adultery that critics argue do not belong in modern law.After Legal Equality: Family, Sex, Kinshipedited by Robert Leckey, Chapter 2, Making family law less sexy ... and more careful, by Jonathan HerringBody Lore and Laws Essays on Law and the Human Body, edited by: Andrew Bainham, Shelley Day Sclater, Martin Richards, pp 171- 182 It is argued that with regard to family life, the state should regulate the parental rights and responsibilities of parents, not focus on whether there is an ongoing sexual/romantic relation between the parents. State control A criticism of marriage is that it gives the state an undue power and control over the private lives of the citizens. The statutes governing marriage are drafted by the state, and not by the couples who marry under those laws. The laws may, at any time, be changed by the state without the consent (or even knowledge) of the married people. The terms derived from the principles of institutionalized marriage represent the interests of the governments. Critics of marriage argue that it is an institution based on control, domination and possession, and that attempting to exercise control over another person's life is immoral and dangerous, and should not be encouraged by the state. Claudia Card, professor of Philosophy at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, writes that:http://pol285.blog.gustavus.edu/files/2009/08/Card_Against_Marriage.pdf > The legal rights of access that married partners have to each other's > persons, property, and lives makes it all but impossible for a spouse to > defend herself (or himself), or to be protected against torture, rape, > battery, stalking, mayhem, or murder by the other spouse... Legal marriage > thus enlists state support for conditions conducive to murder and mayhem. Violence against women Anti-dowry poster in Bangalore, India. See dowry death The United Nations General Assembly defines \\"violence against women\\" as \\"any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or mental harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life.\\" The 1993 Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women noted that this violence could be perpetrated by assailants of either gender, family members and even the \\"State\\" itself.United Nations General Assembly Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women (1993) Critics of marriage argue that it is complicit in the mistreatment and subjugation of women across the world. Common concerns raised today focus on the health and general well-being of women, who, in parts of the world, have virtually no protection in law or in practice, against domestic violence within marriage. It is also nearly impossible for women there to get out of abusive relationships.The Need to Abolish Marriage. Feminism & Psychology, May 2004.Feminism Liberalism and Marriage. University of Cambridge, 2010. Abuses are upheld by claims of possession and entitlement in some cultures and the of women is undermined by a powerful act of subordination. According to Gerstel and Sarkisian, domestic violence, isolation, and housework tend to increase for women who sign marriage contracts.Gerstel, Naomi, et al., Marriage: The Good, the Bad, and the Greedy, op. cit., p. 16. Those with lower income draw even fewer benefits from it. Bad marriages, according to Gerstel and Sarkisian, result in higher levels of stress, suicide, hypertension, cancer, and slower wound healing in women.Gerstel, Naomi, et al., Marriage: The Good, the Bad, and the Greedy, op. cit., p. 17. Opponents of legal marriage contend that it encourages violence against women, both through practices carried out within a marriage (such as beating and rape inside marriage - which are legal in some countries and tolerated in many more), and through acts related to marital customs (such as honor killings for refusing arranged marriages; forcing rape victims to marry their rapist, marriage by abduction; or executions for sex outside marriage).http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/38628_7.pdf In some parts of the world, the extreme stigma cast on women who have reached a certain age and are still unmarried often leads these women to suicide.Interviewees explained that societal pressures [to get married in Tajikistan] lead to suicide. A lawyer reported: \\"They try to quickly get their daughters married. There was a twenty-seven year old girl from the region, no one married her and the neighbors were laughing at her. She burned herself a month ago. Society makes fun of her because the first goal of the woman is to get married\\" Suicide is also a common response of women caught in abusive marriages with no possibility of leaving those marriages. Women who are faced with the prospect of forced marriage may commit suicide. Violence and trafficking related to payment of dowry and bride price are also problems. Dowry deaths especially occur in South Asia, and acid throwing is also a result of disputes related to dowry conflicts. In various countries married men have authority over their wives. For instance, Yemeni marriage regulations state that a wife must obey her husband and must not leave home without his permission.http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/ngos/Yemen%27s%20darkside- discrimination_Yemen_HRC101.pdf In Iraq husbands have a legal right to punish their wives. The criminal code states that there is no crime if an act is committed while exercising a legal right. Examples of legal rights include: \\"The punishment of a wife by her husband, the disciplining by parents and teachers of children under their authority within certain limits prescribed by law or by custom\\". Iraqi Penal Code, Paragraph 41 In the Democratic Republic of Congo the Family Code states that the husband is the head of the household; the wife owes her obedience to her husband; a wife has to live with her husband wherever he chooses to live; and wives must have their husbands' authorization to bring a case in court or to initiate other legal proceedings. Specific criticisms Anarchist Famous anarchist Emma Goldman wrote how marriage was not a love pact but an economic agreement that restricts men's and mainly women's freedoms. She criticized how wives were surrendered freedoms permanently for the sake of marriage, and how sexuality and child rearing outside of marriage is shamed.Emma Goldman, \\"Marriage and Love\\" Feminist Marriage is a focus of many feminist concerns. Of these many cultural concerns include the fact that within many marriages women are generally expected to do most of the work in the home, even if they had careers outside the home. A more economic concern is that marriage may also foster economic dependence since women's work is underpaid and women are expected to downgrade their careers when their careers conflict with their husband's or with work in the home. Without appropriate finances women can become dependent on their husband's marriage benefits like health insurance. Some feminists have argued for the reform of marriage while others have argued for its abolition arguing it is entrenched in sexist cultural norms and a legal structure that promotes it. Marxist Within early Marxist texts there existed critiques of marriage. Friedrich Engels wrote how the origins of marriage were not for the purposes of love but instead for private property rights. Monogamous marriage became an institution to be the base of the family and solidify a system for the family to handle private property and its inheritance. Monogamy would later spur on adultery and the business of prostitution. In the book The Second Sex, author Simone de Beauvoir argues that marriage is an alienating institution. Men can become tied to supporting a wife and children and women can become dependent on their husbands, and for children who become the target of rage when the stresses of marriage overwhelm their parents. She argues about marriage that \\"Any institution which solders one person to another, obliging people to sleep together who no longer want to is a bad one\\".Caroline Moorehead, \\"A talk with Simone de Beauvoir\\" Queer theory Within Queer theory a critique exists that the legalization of same- sex marriage simply normalizes the cultured gender norms and economic inequalities of marriage into the LGBT community. Also that the normalization of marriage delegitimizes non-monogamous relationships which are considered common in the LGBT community.

A total of 25 issues were published from February 1975 until April 1977; it was edited by Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone. It was superseded by White Dwarf, which was published on a monthly basis until February 2014, before switching to a weekly format.Games-Workshop.com The reasoning behind such a \\"cultishly- monikered\\"Timesonline.co.uk choice of title has been stated to be a mystery by the co-editors, although anthropomorphism may have been a factor.Eidosinteractive.co.uk In a 2009 interview, Steve Jackson stated that \\"it represented the characteristics you need to be a good games player: wise like an owl and crafty like a weasel\\",Interview with Vice Magazine although this explanation had not been given in any previous editorial or interview. History The publication was initially launched to complement Games Workshop's business of producing hand-crafted wooden board games. The magazine issued a challenge to British game producers to match the efforts of U.S. and German game producers. Copies of early issues were sent speculatively to anyone within the industry in order to generate business, nurture longer-term connections and build partnerships. Owl and Weasel #6: Dungeons & Dragons special issue The sixth issue, a key point in Games Workshop's early history, was released as a Dungeons & Dragons special ‚Äì a first in the UK ‚Äì and issues #11 and #23 doubled as programmes for their early Games Days, leading to coverage in The Times of these events and of their magazine. The editors had expected that the publication would run on beyond issue #25 (in #23, for Games Day II, results for a competition were to be announced in #27), but it was soon decided that a more professional image was required in order to keep up with TSR's transition of their first periodical, The Strategic Review, into the \\"glossy\\" roleplaying and wargaming magazines, Dragon and Little Wars.Eidosinteractive.co.uk Although Owl and Weasel's circulation would be considered tiny by modern standards (having only exceeded 200, including 80 direct sales through hobby shops, by early 1976), its influence in expanding what were previously niche hobbies into the general British marketplace dominated by traditional games was considerable, and it played a key role in setting up Games Workshop for an extended period of rapid growth.OR.atComputerandvideogames.com Content The first few issues covered mostly traditional games, wargaming and postal games. It attempted to create a games club and provide an alternative source for game news with a scope set as wide as possible. Later issues provided coverage of fantasy and role-playing games in general. In the beginning, the promotion of Games Workshop's hand- crafted games boards was supplemented by reselling used wargames and small press games. Marketing of fantasy and science fiction games was expanded by an exclusive deal with TSR in mid-1975. After Livingstone and Jackson returned from Gen Con IX in August 1976, the marketing expanded even further. At Gen Con, they had signed up additional exclusive European distribution rights ‚Äì in part due to the apparent absence of any other European companies from that convention ‚Äì for many American publishers that were still at an early stage of their development.SFX.co.uk Traditional boardgames such as Monopoly and Scrabble, whilst continuing to be covered even after the expansion, were never sold through the magazine. Although D&D;, as the first modern-day commercial role-playing game, had been introduced to Britain no later than Autumn 1974, such playing groups and societies as existed within the country were still on a local basis by 1975 or early 1976, sometimes co-existing with traditional wargaming societies. The aforementioned exclusive deal with TSR thus gave Games Workshop increased impetus to promote their flagship product through the creation of a nationwide D&D; society, which they carried out through the pages of Owl and Weasel. The society was first proposed in issue #9, but it did not commence until issue #12. This further increased the role-playing content of the publication, which had previously included variant rules and short essays on rules and gameplay. Although D&D; society members provided tournaments for conventions such as Games Day, this arrangement was not as formal as TSR's RPGA would later be. In addition to promoting early postal D&D; gaming, Owl and Weasel also facilitated other postal fantasy games co- ordinated by veteran Diplomacy aficionado Don Turnbull, later of TSR (UK). Turnbull had recently been the inaugural inductee to the Origins Hall of Fame for his work on postal gaming, having started the first British postal diplomacy magazine in 1969.Originsgamefair.com Further articles on game mechanics by Turnbull were accompanied by contributions from other well-known hobbyists such as Hartley Patterson and Lew Pulsipher as well as introducing new contributors whose works continued to be printed in Games Workshop's subsequent publication, White Dwarf. Editors Editorial responsibilities were shared between Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone on an issue-by-issue basis.Ian Livingstone: Silver Lodge Interview Although the first couple of issues were edited by Jackson, later issues were usually edited by Livingstone. This trend continued through until he became the lead editor for the first 74 issues of White Dwarf. Reception In the February 1976 edition of The Strategic Review (Issue #6), Gary Gygax thought the zine's 4\\" x 5\\" format was rather small, but said \\"the printing is good\\". He found it to be \\"a newsy item, with LOTS of games plugged, mentioned, advertised, etc.\\" On a scale from \\"Major Tragedy\\" to \\"Major Triumph\\", Gygax rated it a Triumph.

She served as her country's Minister of Social Services and Minister of Health, the first female Chairperson of the People's National Movement party, and as President of the Senate of Trinidad and Tobago (2002‚Äì2007). Biography Early life and education Linda Mohan was born in Siparia, Trinidad to parents Solomon and Sylvia Mohan. She was the eldest child of six ‚Äî five girls and one boy. Career Her childhood dream was to become a medical doctor - which she accomplished along with her husband, Michael Baboolal, in Dublin, Ireland. She interned at the Port of Spain General Hospital. After their children were grown, she was approached by a new political party, National Alliance for Reconstruction (NAR), to be one of their candidates for election to government. She considered this at the time, but due to time constraints she declined. She was actively involved in many charitable organizations - especially with the drug addiction rehabilitation center at Mount St. Benedict - which was the first of it kind in the country. In 1991, she was again approached by the People's National Movement (PNM) to be a candidate for election and this time she accepted. She was the representative for the San Juan/Barataria region and she won this election easily. She was then made Minister of Social Services and then Minister of Health. At the following election - she lost her seat to the opposition but was then made the first female Chairperson of the PNM. She did not run for the next election but was still active in the party. She was nominated as President of the Senate - during which she acted at President of Trinidad and Tobago on numerous occasions. Marriage and children She was married to Michael Baboolal. The couple had five children‚Äîthree daughters and two sons. One of her sons, Henry Baboolal, has a degree in Automotive Engineering from Bolton University and is an instructor/lecturer at the University of Northwestern Ohio in Lima, Ohio. Her daughter Sherylann Ramsaran has graduated with her law degree from the University of London, External Programme and is working on getting her master's degree.

Opened by the now- defunct daily newspaper La Patrie, the station closed shortly after competitor La Presse, which had bought La Patrie in the meantime, transformed that newspaper to a Sunday-only publication. Since La Presse already had its own radio station (namely CKAC), it was felt that CHLP became redundant. The station obtained its licence on October 28, 1930. It went on the air on December 31, 1932, only twenty minutes before the new year.Bill Dulmage. \\"CHLP-AM, Montreal, La Patrie Ltee\\", Canadian Communications Foundation At the time CHLP operated on 1200 kHz with only 100 watts. On March 29, 1941, due to the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement, CHLP moved, like most stations in North America, to a new frequency (1490 kHz in CHLP's case). The station's power was increased to 250 watts in 1942. Another power increase, this time to 1,000 watts, occurred in 1949, and the frequency was changed to 1410 kHz. The old 1490 kHz frequency was never reassigned in the Montreal area, as the now-defunct CFOX would occupy the neighbouring 1470 kHz frequency starting in 1960. CHLP started to air some programming in other languages, most notably in Greek, during the 1950s. The station went off the air on November 15, 1957, at midnight. The 1410 kHz frequency was reactivated on December 21, 1962, when CFMB, a new station, went on the air.

(Note that this LNB is mounted using the 19.2¬∞E feedhorn, not in accordance with SES' installation guidelines) A Duo LNB is a double low-noise block downconverter (LNB) developed by SES for the simultaneous reception of satellite television signals from both the Astra 23.5¬∞E and Astra 19.2¬∞E satellite positions. It is a monoblock LNB, which comprises two feedhorns with a single body of electronics containing the LNB stages along with switching circuitry to select which received signal is passed to the output(s). The Duo LNB uses linear polarisation. Availability A Duo LNB can be purchased in most parts of Europe but it is particularly marketed to Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and the Czech and Slovak Republics.SES ASTRA \\"Duo LNB\\" (August, 2008). Company factsheet Duo LNBs operate as universal LNBs and are manufactured under various brand names, such as Maximum and Inverto, in single, twin-output and quad-output versions ‚Äì with one, two and four outputs (independently selectable for polarisation and frequency band), respectively, for one, two or four receivers/tuners. The Duo LNB is available in two versions - the original Duo LNB for dishes of 80 cm or 85 cm diameter and the Duo LNB II for dishes of 60 cm. Background The Astra 23.5¬∞E orbital position was established as a major source of direct-to-home (DTH) broadcasts for central and western Europe with the launch of Astra 3A at the end of 2007, and some channels moved there from other satellite positions (in particular 19.2¬∞ east) so viewers, who were unable to erect two dishes to receive transmissions from both positions, had to choose between them. In particular, the Czech CS Link and Slovak SkyLink networks moved to Astra 23.5¬∞E, and the Dutch Canal Digitaal launched a new thematic bouquet at 23.5¬∞ east in October 2007. The Dutch regional broadcasters all moved to Astra 23.5¬∞E in September 2007, to be lost to viewers without access to the new satellite position. The Duo LNB was introduced to enable a single satellite dish to be used to receive all the channels from 19.2¬∞ east and 23.5¬∞ east. The ASTRA2Connect satellite internet service also operates from 23.5¬∞ east. In May 2010 the Astra 3B satellite was launched to the Astra 23.5¬∞ east position to release the Astra 1E and Astra 1G satellites previously in that position for use at other orbital positions. The launch had been much postponed due to technical problems with the Ariane 5 launch rocket. In February 2011, Bulgarian DTH operator Satellite BG launched a package of more than 60 standard definition channels and 12 high definition channels using three transponders on Astra 3B, further increasing the appeal for viewers to receive both satellite positions. Technology The basic technology behind the Duo LNB is not new. It takes advantage of the fact that signals hitting a dish off-axis will be focused (albeit with some diffusion) off axis in the opposite direction. So, with the dish aligned so that the central LNB is receiving one satellite, a secondary offset LNB can be aligned on the focus of a second satellite spaced away from the first. This effect has been exploited for many years to receive signals from two satellites at once with a single dish, and two LNBs have been most commonly arranged on a dish in this way for reception of Astra 19.2¬∞E and the Hot Bird satellites at 13¬∞ east, primarily for the abundance of TV channels from 19.2¬∞ east, and some additional channels (especially adult channels) from 13¬∞ east. A monoblock LNB provides a convenient alternative to fixing and aligning two LNBs to a dish independently. The two feedhorns are positioned at the correct spacing for reception from the two satellites required and the DiSEqC switching system is used to select between the signals from the two satellites with commands from the connected receiver. In other respects, the monoblock LNB acts as a normal LNB to the connected receiver. The required separation of the monoblock's feedhorns depends on the angular separation of the satellites to be received, the position of the receive site on the Earth's surface and the focal length of the dish. Fortunately, monoblock LNBs can be standardised for sites across Europe provided that a \\"standard\\" offset dish with a focal length/diameter (f/D) ratio of 0.6 is used.Bains, Geoff. \\"ABC Guide To Multi-feed Dishes\\" What Satellite & Digital TV (August, 2007) 44-47\\" Monoblock LNBs for 19.2¬∞ east and 13¬∞ east have been widely available for several years (indeed, the DiSEqC switching system was originally designed for just this setup). However, these do not function correctly for Astra 23.5¬∞E and Astra19.2¬∞E because these satellites are at a different angular separation. In fact, it can be difficult to physically fit two separate LNBs onto a dish at the correct separation for Astra 23.5¬∞E and Astra 19.2¬∞E because their bulk may prevent the feedhorns sitting close enough together. The Duo LNB is carefully designed with the correct spacing of the feedhorns, DiSEqC level 1.0 switching between the satellites and a low noise amplifier and conversion system. Installation The Duo LNB is designed to be fitted with the feedhorn for Astra 23.5¬∞E mounted on the dish's feedarm, and the 19.2¬∞E feedhorn sticking out to the right - as viewed standing in front of the dish, with the satellites behind you. The Astra 23.5¬∞E feedhorn is identified with a \\"23.5\\" marking on the casing. The dish is then aligned on the 23.5¬∞E satellite position, using a signal strength meter, in the normal way.Duo LNB installation SES Installation video (in German). Accessed May 27, 2014 The Duo LNB is rotated in the feed clamp to a certain tilt angle to provide both the correct 'skew' angle for the feedhorns to align with the incoming signals, and the necessary height difference between the feedhorns to accommodate the different elevations of the two satellite positions. The correct skew angle and height difference depend on the position of the receive site on Earth's surface, and in most locations the tilt angle from the LNB is a compromise between their ideal settings. However, within Europe the single tilt angle adjustment provides sufficient accuracy for both settings for reliable reception. The tilt angle for the Duo LNB at the receive site location may be found in maps or city tables (a scale is marked on the LNB's 23.5¬∞E feedhorn casing) or found by adjustment with a signal meter connected. By setting the correct tilt angle and aligning the whole dish in azimuth and elevation, the two feedhorns of the LNB are optimally aligned for both orbital positions. Name Confusion The Duo LNB is a monoblock type LNB designed for accessing two satellite positions with a single dish and it should not be confused with a \\"dual LNB\\", which is the common (US) name for an LNB with a single feedhorn but two separate outputs. A double LNB called just a \\"Monoblock\\" will usually be for reception of 19.2¬∞ east and 13¬∞ east, and not a Duo LNB suitable for Astra 23.5¬∞E and Astra 19.2¬∞E.

History For the opening of the long railway line from Doberan to Heiligendamm the DHE had procured two 'tramway' locomotives, which were given the numbers 1 and 2. The long section through the town in Doberan in particular made the procurement of such engines sensible. When the private railways were nationalised in 1890 the locomotives were renumbered to 1001 and 1002. Not long afterwards, it became clear that the locomotives were not able to cope with the rising levels of traffic as they could only haul a three- coach train. So in 1891 and 1898 Class XIX engines were procured. The tramway locos were retired in 1916.  Design Details  The locomotives were designed as box frame engines (Kastenlokomotiven) and had an outside plate frame with a well tank. The two saturated steam engines were on the inside, and the diagonally-oriented cylinders drove the rear coupled axle. The entire running gear was covered. Suspension was provided by leaf springs over the axle boxes. The boiler was horizontal. The firehole was located on the right hand side. In order to keep the minimise the impact when driving through Doberan, exhaust steam was expelled through a condenser. The footplate was located on the right hand side and could be used for driving both forwards and backwards due to the good visibility it afforded. Reversing the Joy valve gear was achieved using a lever working a crossed eccentric rod.

Early life Roux was born at Pembury maternity hospital in Kent, whilst his father Albert Roux was working for the horse race trainer Major Peter Cazalet. Apprenticeship and training After leaving school at age 16, Roux undertook apprenticeship work with Master Patissier, Hellegouarche in Paris. From summer 1979 until January 1980, he worked as a commis de cuisine at Le Gavroche, under both his father and his uncle. He then spent two years as a commis de cuisine trainee under Alain Chapel at his hotel and restaurant in Mionnay, in the Rh√¥ne-Alpes region near Lyon. After undertaking basic training with the French Army, from February 1982 to March 1983 he served his military service at the Elysee Palace, working for both Presidents Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing and Fran√ßois Mitterrand. Having finished his military service, Roux then worked for four months in Paris: two months at Charcuterie G√©rard Mothu in St-Mand√©; and then two months at Boucherie Lamartine on the Avenue Victor-Hugo. Career Having served his apprenticeship and training mainly away from the Roux brothers' British business empire, he joined his uncle at the Waterside Inn, in Bray, Berkshire in 1985, before working with his father at Le Gavroche from the April of the same year. He then worked in and managed the Roux brothers catering business for three years, before returning to Le Gavroche in 1990, the year the two brothers split their business down family lines. When his father retired in 1993, Michel Jr took over the world-famous restaurant. A food consultant to the Walbrook club since 2003, he also consults for the fine dining providers Restaurant Associates. Roux has also written several books, including Le Gavroche Cookbook; The Marathon Chef; and Matching Food and Wine, which was named the best book on matching wine and food at the Gourmand World Cookbook Awards. Media Roux has made various television appearances, including on his friend Gordon Ramsay's ITV produced Hell's Kitchen, and as an expert judge on the BBC Two programme MasterChef: The Professionals (2008‚Äì13). In 2012 he appeared as a guest judge on Masterchef South Africa. From 2013 until 2014, Roux co- presented BBC Two's Food and Drink alongside Kate Goodman. In 2013, he appeared as one of the mentors in the series The Chef's Protege. In March 2014, Roux announced that he was leaving the BBC due to a conflict over his brand ambassadorship for Albert Bartlett Rooster potatoes. In 2015, Roux returned to television and presented First Class Chefs for the Disney Channel and Kitchen Impossible with Michel Roux Jr for Channel 4. In April 2016 Roux stepped in as presenter on BBC's Saturday Kitchen after the departure of James Martin who left after 10 years. Roux ruled himself out of becoming a full-time host. Controversies In November 2016, the Guardian reported that whilst Roux's restaurant made over ¬£250,000 in profit in 2015, he was paying some of his chefs less than the minimum wage. A chef showed the Guardian journalist Robert Booth evidence that chefs typically put in over 65 hours of labour per week, only earning about ¬£5.50 per hour. Work days began at 7am ending at 11.30pm, with only one hour break between lunch and dinner times and sometimes as little as fifteen minutes for meal times. Booth's Guardian article noted that in response to the expose, \\"Roux said ... he was 'embarrassed and sorry' after the Guardian revealed he was paying chefs as little as ¬£5.50 per hour when they were working 68 hours per week.\\" In late-2016, it was revealed that Roux was keeping servers' tips and service charge. In light of this, he vowed to \\"scrap tips and service charge\\", instead including them in the cost of a meal. This has garnered backlash from customers and critics alike, as it leaves the customer with no viable way of choosing how much to tip, and encourages the inference that the optional service charge is now mandatory. Personal life Roux is married to Giselle, a French citizen who has worked in the restaurant business for numerous years and is currently the secretary at Le Gavroche. The couple have a daughter, Emily, who is training to be a chef. The Roux family lives in London. Roux does not drink between Monday and Friday. Roux is a big rugby fan and is an honorary member of Harlequins and attends most matches. He also likes Manchester United and Wigan Warriors, and is a keen marathon runner, having run the London marathon twelve times to raise funds for the children's charity VICTA (Visually Impaired Children Taking Action).

The film is based on the 1938 novel Father Malachy's Miracle by Bruce Marshall and tells the story of a supposed miracle in a West German town that is soon exploited and sensationalized by the media and profiteers. The film won several awards and was the official West German submission to the 34th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film. Plot Next to a church in a prosperous German industrial town is the Eden bar, a night club and brothel. The Eden bar is a thorn in the side of the worldly innocent monk Father Malachia (Horst Bollmann), who is praying to God that he will close the bar. The prayer is heard and the building and the bar and all people inside vanish and reappear on an island in the North Sea. This apparent miracle draws the attention of the media, politicians and scientists, all trying to find rational explanations. The Catholic Church is reluctant to officially recognize this occurrence as a miracle, both fearing a loss of control in matters of faith, or a loss of face if the disappearance of the Eden bar would turn out to be a fabrication. Meanwhile, believers from all over the world pilgrimage to the former location of the bar. Soon the site becomes a fairground, with the towns people, profiteers and journalists trying to make a profit from the sudden influx of pilgrims and the miracle. This includes the sale of holy water, Malachia Stollen and miniature models of the Eden bar. A young woman, who was in the bar during the night the bar vanished, becomes a media star. Financial investors are buying the island where the Eden bar reappeared, and construct a casino that soon attracts crowds of people. Father Malachia is confronted with interview requests by journalists and by pilgrims beleaguering the church and hoping to meet him. As he has spent most of his life in the monastery, he feels helpless in the face of the excesses of modern society. He soon regrets that he asked God for a miracle. He travels to the island and prays for a second miracle that will end the frenzy, and is heard by God who returns the Eden bar to its original location.

He wrote the script together with the screenwriter Heinz Pauck, planning to not only adapt the original novel, but also to expose the \\"social structure of our saturated [society]\\" (). Writing the script took more than six months, whereas the actual filming took five months. For the main role of Father Malachias Wicki cast the stage actor Horst Bollmann, who had never played in a film. Other important roles were played by experienced film actors such as Richard M√ºnch or G√ºnter Pfitzmann. Supporting actors were often lay actors who played a role corresponding to their real profession, as for example journalists, press photographers or businessmen. Several known people had cameo appearances in the film, including the German translator of Justine, Maria Carlsson as a socialite, the humorist and graphic artist Loriot as a playboy and the film journalist Kurt Habernoll as a sausage vendor. The film was shot completely on location and not a single scene was shot on a studio set. Most scenes were shot in Gelsenkirchen in the Ruhr Area. In total 95 different locations were used, including several industrial sites and the Musiktheater im Revier. A small part of the footage showing monks and priests was shot in advance at the Eucharistical World Congress in Munich. To increase the authenticity of the film Wicki used real brand names such Miele, K√∂nig-Pilsener, Coca-Cola or Telefunken. Some brand names featured in fictional slogans that were used by those trying to make a profit from the miracle, for example \\"The girl that witnessed the miracle flies around the world with PAA\\". () or \\"Stay on earth -- drive Borgward\\" (). The film was planned to have its premiere at the International Film Festival in Berlin. As it was not yet completed the selection committee of the film festival saw only a raw cut of the film. This led to speculation in the tabloid press of a race against the time and that Wicki had collapsed at the cutting table due to the time pressure. Ultimately the film was finished only seven hours before it premiered at the festival. Distribution and responses Upon release the film received positive, albeit not enthusiastic, reviews by the German press. The S√ºddeutsche Zeitung wrote, against the background of the artistic and economic stagnation of the German film industry that Wicki is \\"a kind of Messiah ... who did not only have to prove himself and others his talent, but also had to show that the [German] film industry has a right to exist.\\" (). Die Welt wrote that \\"the cinema of this country [Germany] is not yet finished\\" (). The film won several awards. Nationally, The Miracle of Father Malachia won the Silver Bear for Best Director at the 11th Berlin International Film Festival in 1961, and three German film awards in the categories Best Actor, Best Set Design and a Filmband in Silber for Best Feature Film in 1962. In 1961 it also won the prize of German Film Critics, the Goldene Muschel mit Perle in the category Best Actor and the Bambi for best artistic achievement in the category German film. Internationally the film won the Prize of the City at the Valladolid International Film Festival in 1963.

From 1827 until his death he was President of the Prussian State Council. Early life and entry into the army Duke Charles Frederick Augustus of Mecklenburg was born in Hanover where his father Duke Charles of Mecklenburg was the governor. His mother was Princess Charlotte of Hesse-Darmstadt, his father's second wife who died shortly after his birth on 12 December. On 2 June 1794 his father succeeded Adolf Friedrich IV as the reigning Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Duke Charles entered into the Prussian service at a young age. By the age of 19 he held a commission as a Captain and by 1806 he had been promoted to the rank Major. He fought for his brother in law King Frederick William III of Prussia during the War of the Fourth Coalition accompanying the king in his flight following the Prussian defeat in the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt. For his services in the Saale campaign Duke Charles was awarded the Order of the Black Eagle. 1813 A statue of Duke Charles in Neustrelitz By 1813 he had been promoted to the rank Major General and was in command of brigade attached to the force of General Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg. Duke Charles led his brigade at the Battle of Katzbach. During this campaign while commanding a small column he managed to hold off an attack by French forces who had superior numbers for a whole day before being ordered to withdraw during the night. Shortly after this engagement Duke Charles was instructed by Gebhard Leberecht von Bl√ºcher to keep open the communication with the forces of Louis Alexandre Andrault de Langeron and Fabian Gottlieb von Osten-Sacken. Shortly after setting out with his brigade he was attacked by three French columns. Although vastly outnumbered he managed to hold his ground until he seized an opportunity and placing himself at the head of one of his battalions he managed to drive the French back. For this achievement he was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class. The next action he saw was when the Prussian army crossed the Elbe at Wartenburg on 13 October. Given orders to outflank the right wing of the French, Duke Charles took his brigade across the Elbe and attacked the village of Bleddin and succeeded in driving the French out, taking nine of their cannons and a number of prisoners. On 16 October he fought with distinction at the Battle of M√∂ckern. Leading his brigade in a bayonet charge against the French batteries and columns he succeeded in forcing the section of the line they attacked back but at the cost of his whole brigade almost being taken out with Duke Charles and the other officers all being wounded in the charge. Later that year Duke Charles was appointed to command the 1st of the Line the oldest regiment of foot in the service. Later years In 1815 Duke Charles was appointed a Lieutenant General and Commandant of the Royal Guards and Grenadiers. He was later appointed President of the Prussian State Council in 1827. Duke Charles never married and died in Berlin at the age of 51.

Established as a single room in New City School in 1936, it has expanded into a facility with over 200,000 volumes. History New City Free Library photographed by C.McMorran The library was officially launched on June 19, 1936, in response to a plan by the New York State Education Department to provide citizens of rural areas with library service. It began as a room in the New City School, opening one afternoon a week, but as the book collection of the library increased, space quickly became a concern. Funding also became a concern, particularly in 1950 when the New City School was no longer able to provide space or finances for the library. With grants and public donations, including a donation of land by the New City Fire Department, the library broke ground on a free-standing building on May 3, 1952. The library opened to the public on July 11, 1953, remaining opening for 12 hours each week. As library membership and book collections continued to grow, the library expanded its hours and staff, also increasing its capacity with the addition of a trailer in the early 1960s. When the New City Fire Department deemed the building safe for occupancy only by 14 patrons at a time in 1965, a vote was held to appropriate sufficient funds for the library to purchase a new location, to which it moved on January 2, 1967. In 1977, the library purchased of land. After budget was approved for the construction of a much larger building in December 2007, ground was broken in November 1978. The new facility contained as well as a generous allocation for parking for 120 cars. With community support, the library took possession of its new property on January 19, 1980. Over subsequent years, the building has been expanded with additional, including a children's wing, a circulation lobby and a basement which houses a technical services department and an audiovisual department.

Its name derives from the unused generating station Hudson and Manhattan Railroad Powerhouse.Warehouse Historic District This neighborhood was previously called \\"WALDO\\", an acronym for Work And Live District Overlay, but has since been renamed though is still occasionally used on maps and in local parlance. Part of what was once called the Horseshoe Section, the neighborhood's informal borders are Newport to the north, Exchange Place to the east, Paulus Hook to the south and Harsimus Cove to the west. The landmarked Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company Warehouse is located at Provost St., between 1st and Bay Sts (). The Pavonia-Newport, Harsimus Cove, and Harborside stations of the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail, and the Grove Street station of the PATH system are nearby. WALDO and PAD The A & P Warehouse WALDO (for \\"Work and Live District Overlay) was the name of a planning strategy adopted into Jersey City zoning in 2002 per a proposal written by the Urban Land Institute, and was deleted from the zoning on January 24, 2007. As the name implies, the purpose was to most effectively re- use an eight block area of industrial buildings, and transition them to include more residences, without zoning them a purely residential use. Currently, most zoning codes do not allow industrial and residential uses to co-exist on the same lot. The district also aimed at retaining the high bulk, low rise industrial buildings which were threatened by development of high rise towers in the area. The plan indicated that roughly half of the apartments built in the existing industrial buildings in the eight block neighborhood must go to artists. Under the district plan, two industrial buildings were renovated into loft apartments, and one new building, Waldo Lofts, was constructed. During the district's lifespan, there were several attempts to bring in more housing and studios for artists, to make the area more pedestrian friendly, and to bring in art schools or museums. There were also been proposals to turn the Powerhouse into residences, shops, galleries, and museum space. Most of the proposals for retail and gallery space never materialized or found tenants, and as a result the eight blocks of industrial buildings remain much the same as in 2002 when the district began. As well, the city approved new zoning for a large development on First Street which deviated from the district plan. New zoning is proposed for several other blocks. Most proposed developments are higher rise structures, and the majority of capital investment in the district favors high rise development. These factors led to WALDO being removed from the zoning ordinance. Waldo Yards The term Waldo has been used before the zoning plan was introduced. Waldo Avenue is named for Samuel Waldo who built and owned three attached brownstone homes located on the NW corner of Magnolia and Waldo Avenues. Today, the three structures still stand. The avenue, which runs south from Newark Avenue to \\"The Island\\" that overlooks the Waldo Yards, was originally used by the Pennsylvania Railroad Jersey City Branch. It is currently used by Port Authority Trans Hudson mass transit trains.

From Poggibonsi in Tuscany, Niccol√≤, with seven companions (six of whom eventually returned home), departed for Venice, from where they embarked for a sea voyage to Cyprus. He sojourned for some months on the island in the service of King Hugh IV. He then left for Jaffa, and from there visited the shrines in Jerusalem (where he served for four months in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre) and the myriad holy sites of Palestine. He went as far as Damascus intending to visit \\"Babylonia\\" and \\"Chaldaea\\" (probably Baghdad), which he never did. Niccol√≤ then left by ship from Beirut and stopped in Egypt, where he visited Alexandria, \\"Babylonia\\" (probably Fustat, Old Cairo), New Cairo, and the places in the Sinai mentioned in the Old Testament. There he also visited the ancient Saint Catherine's Monastery. He continued north to Gaza and there turned back towards the Nile delta, where he took a ship from Damietta back to Cyprus. In Cyprus Niccol√≤ boarded a ship for Italy. The ship followed an adventurous course, taking him by the Anatolian coast of the Ottoman Empire, to call in the port of Tripoli, and near Poreƒç on the Adriatic, where he was captured by brigands but managed to escape. He arrived safely in Venice late in 1349 and went to Ferrara, where he was detained until the spring of 1350, when he finally, after five years of wandering, returned to Poggibonsi. Upon his return, Niccol√≤ recounted his travels in the Libro d'oltramare (\\"Book of Outremer\\"). Rich in detail, it describes the sights, the distances on the roads, the tolls paid, and the indulgences associated with various shrines. His descriptions of buildings and cities are unusually detailed, and the picture he paints of Jerusalem was based on four months residence there. His entire pilgrimage was extraordinarily long by the standards of the time. This is probably attributable to his desire to see sites that lacked the facilities for receiving pilgrims, for visiting far-off sites in Egypt, Syria, and Iraq, and his financial difficulties (his first stay in Cyprus necessitated by the need to raise cash). Organised trips departed regularly from Venice, bringing pilgrims to Jerusalem and its suburbs (like Mount Tabor), but Niccol√≤ eschewed typical tourism. Niccol√≤ informs us that the house of the Virgin Mary at Nazareth, long a Christian holy place, was destroyed, possibly by the Mamelukes sometime after 1289, when it was last recorded standing. When Niccol√≤ visited the site, all that remained was a cove with three walls. Niccol√≤ is also an important witness to a supposed Mongol conquest of Jerusalem in 1300, since he records that the Mongols removed a gate (the \\"Golden Gate\\") from the Temple of Jerusalem (today the Dome of the Rock) and had it transferred to Damascus. The Libro d'oltramare was translated into German around 1467 by Gabriel Muffel of Nuremberg, who was probably working out of Passau. An illuminated manuscript (Egerton 1900) of the German translation from 1467, purports to be a description of Muffel's visit to the Holy Land in 1465. The earliest manuscripts of Niccol√≤'s Libro are unillustrated, but the Egerton 1900 has 147 miniatures. The Libro d'oltramare was first published anonymously in an Italian translation based on the German in Bologna in 1500. This version, the Viazo da Venesia al Sancto Iherusalem, contained 145 woodcuts and twenty-six printings before 1600. Nothing is known regarding the rest of his life.

It was Petersen's first theatrical feature film, and was based on the novel of the same name by Horst Bosetzky, published anonymously under his pseudonym -ky. The film is a psychological thriller and focuses on the intense conflict between a university professor and a blackmailer. The film features Klaus Schwarzkopf and J√ºrgen Prochnow as the two main characters and won two Bundesfilmpreise. Plot J√ºrgen Prochnow and Klaus Schwarzkopf Ziegenthals (J√ºrgen Prochnow), a failed student, makes ends meet as an academic ghost writer. By accident he discovers that the respected professor of sociology, R√ºdiger Kolczyk (Klaus Schwarzkopf), has plagiarized his doctoral dissertation by translating the work of an American scholar. He decides to blackmail Kolczyk and to ask for 10,000 DM and additional monthly payments of 1,500 DM. Kolczyk initially agrees, but vows to Ziegenhals that \\"only one of us will survive\\". Looking for a way to fight back, Kolczyk tries to gather information about Ziegenhals from Miezi (Elke Sommer), a prostitute and a housemate and friend of Ziegenhals. As Miezi has saved enough money she is thinking of leaving her profession. At the same time her violent ex-boyfriend and former pimp, Kalle Pr√∂tzel (Claus Theo G√§rtner), has been released from prison; he murders her and steals her savings. During the investigations the police finds out that Miezi had an appointment with Kolczyk and discovers the payments Kolczyk makes to Ziegenhals. Being the main suspects in the murder investigation only increases the hatred between Kolczyk and Ziegenhals, who fight with all means available. Kolczyk, learning that Ziegenhals thinks that Kolczyk wants to kill him, starts playing with Ziegenhals' mind. For example, he sends him a package with an alarm clock, making Ziegenhals think that he has received a mail bomb. Ziegenhals meanwhile befriends Kolczyk's daughter Ginny (Kristina Nel) and makes her his lover. Although this forces the both to have to pretend in public that they are friends, the final disaster cannot be averted.

Petersen had already directed several high-profile films for television, including four episodes for the Tatort television series. Klaus Schwarzkopf and J√ºrgen Prochnow had already played in some of Petersen's Tatort productions. The script was based on the novel of the same name written by Horst Bosetzky, a professor of sociology. At this time the identity of Horst Bosetzky was unknown as due to his position as a professor he published under the pseudonym -ky. One or the Other of Us was shot in October and November 1973 in Berlin and Sylt. The film was shot in Eastmancolor on 35 mm in a 1.66:1 aspect ratio. The film made its theatrical debut on 22 February 1974 at the Gloria-Palast in Berlin. It was first showed on television on 12 February 1982 on ZDF. The film was released on VHS in 1998 and on DVD in 2008 in Germany.

It is a member of the DOCK-D subfamily of the DOCK family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) which function as activators of small G proteins. Dock11 activates the small G protein Cdc42.  Discovery  Dock11 was identified as a protein which is highly expressed in Germinal center B lymphocytes. Subsequent RT-PCR analysis revealed expression of this protein in the spleen, thymus, bone marrow and in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Dock11 is expressed at lower levels in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, C2C12 myoblasts and Neuro-2A neuroblastoma cells. Dock11 mRNA has also been detected in the pars intermedia.  Structure and function  Dock11 exhibits the same domain arrangement as other members of the DOCK-D/Zizimin subfamily and shares the highest level of sequence identity with Dock9. It contains a DHR2 domain which mediates GEF activity and a DHR1 domain which may interact with membrane phospholipids. It also contains an N-terminal PH domain which may be involved in its recruitment to the plasma membrane. Dock11 binds and activates nucleotide-free Cdc42 via its DHR2 domain and has also been reported to mediate positive feedback on active, GTP-bound Cdc42, although this interaction required a small N-terminal region of Dock11 in addition to the DHR2 domain. Cdc42 in turn regulates signaling pathways that control diverse cellular functions including morphology, migration, endocytosis and cell cycle progression. Gene expression studies have suggested that Dock11 may have a role in the development of pituitary and testicular tumours.

It was constructed in 1868, at a cost of a million dollars (equivalent to about US dollars in ), for distiller and entrepreneur Samuel N. Pike (1822‚Äì1872) of Cincinnati. The building survived in altered form until 1960 as an RKO movie theater, after which it was replaced by part of Penn South, an urban renewal housing development.Pike was a German Jew, born in 1822 in Schwetzingen/Baden, Germany. His birth name was \\"Samuel N. Hecht\\"; his family changed the name in 1827 in the USA to \\"Pike\\". See: Rehs, Michael. Wurzeln in fremder Erde: Zur Geschichte der s√ºdwestdeutschen Auswanderung nach Amerika (Stuttgart: DRW- Verlag (de), 1984) ; . History Detail from map published in 1899 Pike's Opera House was built on what had been the property of Clement Clarke Moore, whose home, \\"Chelsea\\", has given its name to the neighborhood. The architect was Griffith Thomas. The grand auditorium was seventy feet from parquet to dome, with six proscenium boxes and two tiers. It could accommodate 1800 people, but over 3500 were known to have gained admittance at some popular performances. The first performance, on January 9, 1868, was Il trovatore, after which seven operettas by Jacques Offenbach were given in the space of four months. But the theater lost money initially, owing in part to competition from the Academy of Music on 14th Street. Fisk and the Grand Opera House Jim Fisk and Jay Gould bought Pike's theater in January 1869 and renamed it the Grand Opera House. Fisk extended the repertory to include more operetta‚ÄîOffenbach's La P√©richole had already received its American premiere there, January 4, 1869‚Äîand plays, like Victorien Sardou's La Patrie, expressly translated for the theater. Vehicles for his mistress Josie Mansfield are often reported, though her name does not appear in the detailed cast lists in Brown. It was also reported, that her house west of the theater on 23rd Street was connected to the theater by a tunnel.Frances Farmer portrayed her in the wildly inaccurate film The Toast of New York (1937). Fisk's murder At the time when Fisk and Gould's failed attempt to corner the market in gold resulted in \\"Black Friday\\", September 1869, Fisk barricaded himself in his second-floor premises at the opera house, which served as headquarters for his Erie Railway. When he was shot by his partner, Edward S. Stokes, Fisk's body lay in state in the grand lobby. Ted Mark's Sunday night concert, Poole and Donnelly In 1876, when the authorities began cracking down on theatre fire safety, the Grand Opera House was the only theatre to pass inspection. A rapid series of managers were unable to make the house a financial success, its overhead swallowing profit. \\"The house was considered, in theatrical parlance, a 'Jonah', and it was almost impossible to find any respectable manager who would take it,\\" according to theater critic Thomas Allston Brown. When John F. Poole (1833‚Äì1893) and Thomas Lester Donnelly (1832‚Äì1880) rented the theatre in the Autumn of 1876, with the proviso that \\"a small percentage of the profits should go to the Erie Railway company\\". The new management lowered the price of admission and catered to the popular tastes of New York's \\"west side\\": Uncle Tom's Cabin (in blackface) and Buffalo Bill were among the first season's attractions; theatrical productions were accompanied by \\"specialty acts\\". When Donnelly died in 1880, Poole, in partnership with Donnelly's widow, Sarah Donnelly (n√©e Sarah D. Williams; 1840‚Äì1888), continued managing the theatre until May 31, 1882. RKO cinema For its conversion to the second RKO 23rd Street Theater, Thomas W. Lamb Associates converted it in modern style. It opened August 4, 1938 with a double bill of Having a Wonderful Time and Sky Giant. It closed for demolition on June 15, 1960, in order to make way for the Penn South housing development, and was gutted by fire June 29.

See also Powers available to persons accredited under Community Safety Accreditation Schemes , Home Office website, retrieved 29 August 2008 * The power to: ** require the name and address of a person who has committed a criminal offence that causes injury, alarm and distress to another person or damage or loss of someone else's property, or to whom a penalty notice has been issued; ** require the name and address of a person acting in an anti-social manner; ** require a person to stop drinking in a designated public place and confiscate and dispose of alcohol being consumed in a designated place; ** confiscate alcohol from young people; ** confiscate cigarettes and tobacco products from young people; ** require the removal of abandoned vehicles; ** stop cyclists on suspicion of riding on a footpath; ** stop a vehicle for the purposes of an inspection; ** control traffic for the purpose of escorting abnormal loads, for the purpose of conducting a traffic survey, and for other purposes * The power to issue a fixed penalty notice: ** for riding a bicycle on footpath; ** for dog fouling; ** for littering; ** for graffiti and fly posting; * The power to issue a penalty notice for disorder for: ** the sale of alcohol to person aged under 18; ** buying or attempting to buy alcohol for consumption by a person aged under 18; ** consumption of alcohol by a person aged under 18 or allowing such consumption; ** delivery of alcohol to a person aged under 18 or allowing such delivery; ** possession by a person aged under 18 of an adult firework; ** wasting police time or giving a false report; ** behaviour likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress; The powers available to individuals accredited under a community safety accreditation scheme are similar to those of a police community support officer (PCSO), although PCSOs are designated with powers by the chief constable, as opposed to being accredited with them as non-employees. The Act also makes it a criminal offence to assault, resist or obstruct an accredited person in the execution of their duty, or impersonate an accredited person.  Requirements for accreditation  A person accredited under a community safety accreditation scheme has to be assessed as suitable to exercise the powers, trained by an Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) approved provider in their use, and vetted to a national standard. The Act also requires that the organisation employing an accredited person must be 'fit and proper' and that they must have a satisfactory complaints procedure in place.Section 41 of the Police Reform Act 2002 An accredited person remains under the control of their normal employer, and is not managed or tasked by the police force. Some accredited persons are tasked by their respective police force to conduct patrols, attend incidents and gather intel, such as the community protection officers of Nottingham City Council who work with Nottinghamshire Police. These officers carry police Airwave radios and are dispatched to incidents by the force control room. Accredited Persons must wear a uniform approved by the police when exercising their powers, and carry an ID card which also shows the powers they are authorised to use. Some forces print the powers on the back of the ID card, while others give the employees a separate powers card specifically for this.  Examples  Common examples of employees granted powers under a community safety accreditation scheme include security guards, community, parish, park and dog wardens, trading standards officers, and housing association staff.

Nineteen of the employing organisations were private companies. Essex Police had accredited the most people -- 291 individuals in 25 organisations. The powers which had been granted most widely (by more than 20 forces) were the power to seize alcohol from a person aged under 18 in a designated place, the power to seize tobacco from a person under 16, and the power to require the name and address of a person acting in an anti-social manner.

K. Pati and S. L. Braunstein, \\"Impossibility of Deleting an Unknown Quantum State\\", Nature 404 (2000), p164. It is a time-reversed dual to the no-cloning theorem,W.K. Wootters and W.H. Zurek, \\"A Single Quantum Cannot be Cloned\\", Nature 299 (1982), p802.D. Dieks, \\"Communication by EPR devices\\", Physics Letters A, vol. 92(6) (1982), p271. which states that arbitrary states cannot be copied. This theorem seems remarkable, because, in many senses, quantum states are fragile; the theorem asserts that, in a particular case, they are also robust. Physicist Arun K. Pati along with Samuel L. Braunstein proved this theorem. The no-deleting theorem, together with the no-cloning theorem, underpin the interpretation of quantum mechanics in terms of category theory, and, in particular, as a dagger symmetric monoidal category.John Baez, Physics, Topology, Logic and Computation: A Rosetta Stone (2009)Bob Coecke, Quantum Picturalism, (2009) ArXiv 0908.1787 This formulation, known as categorical quantum mechanics, in turn allows a connection to be made from quantum mechanics to linear logic as the logic of quantum information theory (in exact analogy to classical logic being founded on Cartesian closed categories). Overview of quantum deletion Suppose that there are two copies of an unknown quantum state. A pertinent question in this context is to ask if it is possible, given two identical copies, to delete one of them using quantum mechanical operations? It turns out that one cannot. The no-deleting theorem is a consequence of linearity of quantum mechanics. Like the no-cloning theorem this has important implications in quantum computing, quantum information theory and quantum mechanics in general. The process of quantum deleting takes two copies of an arbitrary, unknown quantum state at the input port and outputs a blank state along with the original. Mathematically, this can be described by: :U psirangle_A psirangle_B Arangle_C = psirangle_A 0rangle_B A'rangle_C where U is the deleting operation which is not necessarily unitary (but a linear operator), psirangle_A is the unknown quantum state, 0rangle_B is the blank state, Arangle_C is the initial state of the deleting machine and A'rangle_C is the final state of the machine. It may be noted that classical bits can be copied and deleted, as can qubits in orthogonal states. For example, if we have two identical qubits 00 rangle and 11 rangle then we can transform to 00 rangle and 10 rangle . In this case we have deleted the second copy. However, it follows from linearity of quantum theory that there is no U that can perform the deleting operation for any arbitrary state psirangle.  Formal statement of the no-deleting theorem  Let psirangle be an unknown quantum state in some Hilbert space (and let other states have their usual meaning). Then, there is no linear isometric transformation such that psirangle_A psirangle_B Arangle_C rightarrow psirangle_A 0rangle_B A'rangle_C, with the final state of the ancilla being independent of psirangle .  Proof  The theorem holds for quantum states in a Hilbert space of any dimension. For simplicity, consider the deleting transformation for two identical qubits. If two qubits are in orthogonal states, then deletion requires that :0 rangle_A 0 rangle_B Arangle_C rightarrow 0rangle_A 0rangle_B A_0rangle_C, :1 rangle_A 1 rangle_B Arangle_C rightarrow 1 rangle_A 0rangle_B A_1rangle_C. Let psirangle = alpha 0rangle + beta 1 rangle be the state of an unknown qubit. If we have two copies of an unknown qubit, then by linearity of the deleting transformation we have :psirangle_A psirangle_B Arangle_C = [alpha^2 0 rangle_A 0rangle_B + beta^2 1rangle_A 1rangle_B + alpha beta (0rangle_A 1rangle_B + 1 rangle_A 0rangle_B ) ] A rangle_C : qquad rightarrow alpha^2 0 rangle_A 0rangle_B A_0rangle_C + beta^2 1rangle_A 0rangle_B A_1rangle_C+ {sqrt 2} alpha beta Phi rangle_{ABC}. In the above expression, the following transformation has been used: :1/{sqrt 2}(0rangle_A 1rangle_B + 1 rangle_A 0rangle_B ) A rangle_C rightarrow Phi rangle_{ABC} . However, if we are able to delete a copy, then, at the output port of the deleting machine, the combined state should be : psirangle_A 0rangle_B A'rangle_C = (alpha 0 rangle_A 0rangle_B + beta 1rangle_A 0rangle_B) A'rangle_C. In general, these states are not identical and hence we can say that the machine fails to delete a copy. If we require that the final output states are same, then we will see that there is only one option: : Phirangle = 1/{sqrt 2}(0 rangle_A 0rangle_B A_1rangle_C + 1rangle_A 0rangle_B A_0rangle_C), and : A'rangle_C = alpha A_0rangle_C + beta A_1rangle_C . Since final state Phi rangle of the ancilla is normalized for all values of alpha, beta it must be true that A_0rangle_C and A_1rangle_C are orthogonal. This means that the quantum information is simply in the final state of the ancilla. One can always obtain the unknown state from the final state of the ancilla using local operation on the ancilla Hilbert space. Thus, linearity of quantum theory does not allow an unknown quantum state to be deleted perfectly. Consequence * If it were possible to delete an unknown quantum state, then, using two pairs of EPR states, we could send signals faster than light. Thus, violation of the no-deleting theorem is inconsistent with the no- signalling condition. * The no-cloning and the no-deleting theorems point to the conservation of quantum information. * A stronger version of the no- cloning theorem and the no-deleting theorem provide permanence to quantum information. To create a copy one must import the information from some part of the universe and to delete a state one needs to export it to another part of the universe where it will continue to exist.

The courtyard of the Sultan's palace in the Birini district of Zinder, 1906. Overlooking the town of Zinder, presumably from the French fort (1906). The palace is on the left, rear. The Sultanate of Damagaram was a Muslim pre-colonial state in what is now southeastern Niger, centered on the city of Zinder.  History   Rise  The Sultanate of Damagaram was founded in 1731 (near Myrria, modern Niger) by Muslim Kanouri aristocrats, led by Mallam (r. 1736‚Äì1743). Damagaram was at the beginning a vassal state of the decaying Kanem-Bornu Empire, but it quickly came to conquer all its fellow vassal states of western Bornu. In the 1830s, the small band of Bornu nobles and retainers conquered the Myrria kingdom, the Sassebaki sultanates (including Zinder). By the 19th century, Damagaram had absorbed 18 Bornu vassal states in the area. Zinder rose from a small Hausa village to an important center of the Trans-Saharan trade with the moving of the capital of Damagaram there in 1736. The large fortress of the southeast central city (Birini) was built shortly thereafter, and became a major hub for trade south through Kano and east to Bornu. The Hausa town and Zengou, its Tuareg suburb, expanded with this trade. Apex Damagaram had a mixed relationship with the other major regional power, the Sokoto Caliphate to the south. While it provided aid to the animist Hausa-led refugee states to its west (in what is now Niger) who were formed from the rump of the states conquered by the Sokoto Caliph, Damagaram also maintained good relations with its southern neighbors. Damagaram sat astride the major trade route linking Tripoli to Kano, one of the more powerful Sokoto sultanates, which provided the economic lifeblood of both states. An east‚Äìwest trade from the Niger River to Bornu also passed through Zinder, making relations with animist neighbors like Maradi or the Gobirwa as profitable, and thus important. Damagaram also covered some of the more productive of Bornu's western salt-producing evaporation mines, as well as farms producing Ostrich feathers, highly valued in Europe. In the mid-19th century, European travelers estimated the state covered some 70,000 square kilometers and had a population of over 400,000, mostly Hausa, but also Tuareg, Fula, Kanuri, Arab and Toubou. At the center of the state was the royal family, a Sultan (in Hausa the Sarkin Damagaram) with many wives (estimated at 300 by visitor Heinrich Barth in 1851) and children, and a tradition of direct (to son or brother) succession which reached 26 rulers by 1906. The sultan ruled through the activities of two primary officers: the Ciroma (Military commander and prime minister) and his heir apparent, the Yakudima. By the end of the 19th century, Damagaram could field an army of 5,000 cavalry, 30,000-foot soldiers, and a dozen cannon, which they produced in Zinder. Damagaram could also call upon forces of the allied Kel Gres Tuareg who formed communities near Zinder and other parts of the sultanate. French conquest When the French arrived in force in the 1890s, Zinder was the only city of over 10,000 in what is today Niger. Damagaram found itself threatened by well-armed European incursions to the west, and the conquering forces of Rabih az-Zubayr to the east and south. In 1898, A French force under Captain Marius Gabriel Cazemajou spent three weeks under the Sultan's protection in Damagaram. Cazemajou had been dispatched to form an alliance against the British with Rabih, and the Sultan's court was alarmed at the prospect of their two most powerful new threats linking up. Cazemajou was murdered by a faction at the court, and the remainder of the French escaped, protected by other factions. In 1899, the reconstituted elements of the ill-fated Voulet- Chanoine Mission finally arrived in Damagaram on their way to revenge Cazemajou's death. Meeting on 30 July at the Battle of Tirmini, 10 km from Zinder, the well-armed Senegalese-French troops defeated the Sultan and took Damagaram's capital. With colonialism came the loss of some of Damagaram's traditional lands and its most important trade partner to the British in Nigeria. The French placed the capital of the new Niger Military Territory there in 1911. In 1926, following fears of Hausa revolts and improving relations with the Djerma of the west, the capital was transferred to the village of Niamey. The brother of Sultan Ahmadou mai Roumji had earlier sided with the French, and was placed on the throne in 1899 as Sultan Ahamadou dan Bassa. Following French intelligence that a rising by Hausa in the area was preparing a revolt with the aid of the Sultan, a puppet Sultan was placed in power in 1906, though the royal line was restored in 1923. The Sultanate continues to operate in a ceremonial function into the 21st century. Economy The wealth of Damagaram depended on three related sources: taxes and income from the caravan trade, the capture and the exchange of slaves, and internal taxes. Environmental policies Damagaram was originally an area of hunting and gathering activities. As the sultanate developed, the rulers encouraged the rural population to expand farming. Most of the land, especially that surrounding the capital Zinder, belonged to the Sultan and a few notables. In all cases, people who held land were obliged to pay an annual tribute to the sultan. In order to limit the environmental degradation of this conversion to agriculture, the sultan Tanimoune (1854‚Äì84) enforced laws to forbid the cutting of certain trees, with particular emphasis on the gawo tree (Faidherbia albida) with its fertilising properties: \\"He who cuts a gawo tree without authorization will have his head severed; he who mutilates it without reason will have an arm cut off.\\" The sultan and later his successors also proceeded to plant trees, gawo trees in particular, and dispersed the seeds throughout the empire. Other protected trees were aduwa (Balanites aegyptiaca), kurna or magaria (Ziziphus spina-christi and Ziziphus mauritania), madaci dirmi (Khaya senegalensis), magge and gamji (Ficus spp.). The fallow period for land at that time was six years.F.W. Sowers and Manzo Issoufou, \\"Precolonial Agroforestry and its Implications for the Present: the Case of the Sultanate of Damagaram, Niger.

The authority that the sultan claimed on trees was a new practice, breaking with customary views on trees in the Sahel. Traditionally, trees were considered 'gifts from the gods' and could not be owned by any individual, but belonged either to the spirits of the bush or to God. The policies of sultan Tanimoune anchored a new perception: they became called the 'trees of the sultan'.

He took an important role in developing French influence in Burma, and in leading French efforts at supporting the Mons during their conflicts against the Burmese. The Governor- General of French India Joseph Fran√ßois Dupleix had started to show interest in Burma since 1727, on account of the country's abundance in teak and crude oil. As a result, a French shipyard was established in the city of Syriam in 1729, building ships for Pondicherry.Coupland, p.78 The shipyard was abandoned in 1742 due to the revolt of the Mon. Envoy in Burma Bruno was sent to Burma by Joseph Fran√ßois Dupleix pictured above. A few years later, a Mon envoy visited Dupleix requesting French help in the fight against the Burmese.South-east Asia: A Short History - Page 148 by Brian Harrison - 1963 Dupleix promised men and munitions and dispatched Bruno with the objective of developing French influence in the country.Europe and Burma: A Study of European Relations with Burma- Page 62 by Daniel George Edward Hall - 1945: \\"Dupleix promised them men and munitions, but before deciding how far to commit himself he sent over his agent, the Bruno, to Pegu\\".

Governor Thomas Saunders of Madras attempted to counter the French moves in the region by sending a military force to survey the island of Negrais under Captain Thomas Taylor. He also tried to negotiate the cession of Syriam to the British. The Mons firmly opposed these attempts at British encroachment under the counsel of Bruno, who had considerable influence at the Mon court and was especially on excellent terms with the Heir Apparent. Saunders finally decided to occupy Negrais forcibly, occupying the island on 26 April 1753. However, Dupleix's proposals to take control of the Irrawady delta were rejected by the French government, strongly limiting his capacity to intervene there.Coupland, p.80 Participation in the Burman-Mon conflict Bruno helped the Mons organize the defense of Syriam against the Burmese. Following their 1740 revolt against Burmese rule, the Mon sacked Ava in 1752, and overran most of Burma, putting an end to the Toungoo dynasty.The New Encyclop√¶dia Britannica - Page 752, Robert McHenry - 1993 -\\"Assailed from all sides, Ava fell to the Mons in 1752; and the whole of Myanmar passed under Mon rule\\".Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 1970 Page 441 \\"In 1752 they captured Ava and the Toungoo dynasty finally collapsed\\" Soon however, the Burmese were able to repeal the Mons under the leadership of Alaungpaya.Fear and Sanctuary By Hazel J.

The French captains were killed and the 200 sailors forced to join the Burmese army Bruno was roasted to death. From the two ships, Alaugpaya managed to put his hands on 35 ships guns (24 pounders), five field guns, 1,300 muskets, and a large quantity of ammunition. France was precluded from further intervention in Burma, with the advent of the Seven Years' War in Europe (1756‚Äì1763). The French troops with their guns and muskets were incorporated in the Burmese army as gunners, and played a key role in the later battles between the Burmese and the Mons. They were treated well and received Burmese wives. They became an elite corps, which was to play an important role in the Burmese battles against the Siamese and the Manchus. One of them, the Chevalier Milard, was ultimately nominated Captain of the Guard and Master of the Ordnance for the Konbaung dynasty. When they reached old age, the French soldiers were able to retire in Shwebo villages, with the spiritual support of a priest.

According to one theory he was the despot of Velbazhd Constantine Dragash whose daughter Helena Dragash married the Byzantine Emperor Manuel II and became mother of the last Byzantine Emperor Constantine XI. However, that theory has been dismissed by the historians because in 1371 Kera Tamara was already a widow while Constantine Dragash died in 1395. Therefore, despot Constantine who was depicted in the Tetraevangelia of Ivan Alexander next to the Bulgarian princess was another man. Tsar Shishman delivers up his sister to sultan Murad I As early as 1371 when Ivan Alexander died and Ivan Shishman inherited the throne, in the capital Tarnovo arrived ambassadors from the Ottoman Sultan Murad I to arrange his relations with the new Emperor of Bulgaria.

He has taken some college courses but does not have a degree. Career Palin was a union member and belonged to the United Steelworkers union. For eighteen years, he worked for BP in the North Slope oil fields of Alaska. In 2007, in order to avoid a conflict of interest that related to his wife's position as governor, he took a leave from his job as production supervisor, when his employer became involved in natural gas pipeline negotiations with his wife's administration. Seven months later, because the family needed more income, Todd returned to BP. In order to avoid potential conflict of interest, this time, he accepted a non-management position as a production operator. He resigned from his job on September 18, 2009, with the stated reason as a desire to spend more time with his family. He is also a commercial salmon fisherman at Bristol Bay on the Nushugak River. Public life Voter registration Palin first registered to vote in 1989. From October 1995 through July 2002, except for a few months in 2000, he was registered to vote as a member of the Alaskan Independence Party. In late August 2008, The Politico reported that Palin was registered to vote as an independent (undeclared), and had never registered as a Republican. His wife, Sarah, confirmed that he is not registered with any party both in her 2009 memoir, Going Rogue: An American Life, and in a Q&A; session following a 2010 address to a national convention of the Tea Party in Nashville, Tennessee.A C-SPAN video posted on YouTube of the address and Q&A; following the address.

Early on in that role, he encouraged young Alaskans who could not afford college to consider jobs in the oil and gas industry as an effective training ground, and advised the governor on workforce development issues for the natural gas pipeline she supported. In February 2010, the state of Alaska released to msnbc.com reporter Bill Dedman about 1,200 e-mails, which totaled 3,000 pages, that Palin exchanged with state officials. Almost 250 additional ones were withheld by the state, under a claim that executive privilege extends to Palin as an unpaid adviser to the government. Gregg Erickson, columnist for the Anchorage Daily News, said, in September 2008, that Palin \\"obviously plays an important role ... I've seen him in the governor's office and I know that she's conducted interviews in the governor's office with him present\\". The emails showed Palin discussing a wide range of activities: potential board appointees, constituent complaints, use of the state jet, oil and gas production, marine regulation, gas pipeline bids, wildfires, native Alaskan issues, the state effort to save the Matanuska Maid dairy, budget planning, potential budget vetoes, oil shale leasing, \\"strategy for responding to media allegations,\\" staffing at the mansion, per diem payments to the governor for travel, \\"strategy for responding to questions about pregnancy,\\" potential cuts to the governor's staff, \\"confidentiality issues,\\" Bureau of Land Management land transfers and trespass issues and requests to the U.S. transportation secretary.The e-mails are available in an online searchable database from msnbc.com.

Life and work Born in Mount Morris, New York on March 12, 1866, Annie was the daughter of Samuel L. and Julia Lucinda (Conkey) Rockfellow. She studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology receiving a special certificate in 1887. In 1905, she moved to Tombstone, Arizona to care for her father, Samuel, then living with his son, John A. Rockfellow. By 1916, she had moved to Tucson and worked for the firm of architect Henry O. Jaastad from 1916 to 1938 as chief designer.Regan, Margaret, Remembering Rockfellow, Tucson Weekly, January 31, 2000. She was a faculty member at the University of Arizona from 1895‚Äì1897 and a member of numerous Tucson civic clubs including: American Pen Women, Arizona Archaeological and Historical Society, Tucson Natural History Society and the Tucson Fine Arts Association. She visited the San Diego California-Panama-Pacific International Exposition which affected her design style. Her buildings relied and were inspired by regional styles including Pueblo Revival, and Spanish Mission Revival. She created some of Tucson's most prominent buildings including the El Conquistador Hotel and Safford School.Rockfellow, Anne Graham. The Cactus Gets Under the Skin. The Beverly Willis Architecture Foundation. Rockfellow moved to Santa Barbara, California in 1938 and died in 1954 at the age of 87. In Her Own Words The following was written for the Archives of the Arizona Historical and Pioneer Society, Tucson, Arizona by Annie Graham Rockfellow: It was in the 19th century that I made a start towards being an Arizona Pioneer and becoming eligible to the Arizona Historical and Pioneer Society, but no one, least of all my new-born self, knew on a certain March 12 that I was headed that way. In fact, Arizona was nearly as much of a stranger as I, at that time, having been organized only a few years before. My birthplace was a thriving town in Western New York of about 3000 inhabitants, called Mount Morris and organized in 1794. I remember that date because I rode in the parade when the one hundredth anniversary was celebrated in 1894. Perhaps the first concrete remembrance of my babyhood was, at the age of three, a trip to New York with my parents to visit my Aunt Mary for whose daughter I was named. My Aunt Mary was a sister-in-law of George Graham, the publisher of Graham's Magazine, which accounts for the Graham in my cousin Annie's name and mine. I never saw the cousin. She died before my advent in North America. I dimly remember \\"Uncle George and Aunt Lizzie Graham\\" on that early visit, also my cousin Col. Harry Rockefeller, who lost his right arm in the civil war. In my fifth year my father sold his mercantile establishment in Mount Morris and engaged in the nursery business in Rochester, N.Y., being advised to live an outdoor like to strengthen his vitality. I recall playing among the packing boxes in the nursery, wading in the creek that ran through the nursery property, seeing father cut the yard grass with a scythe, and my brother with a powder-blackened face caused by a Fourth-of-July cannon. And SNOW! Real winters, when I was well wrapped and placed on my Christmas sled and drawn by my father and brother to the Mission Sunday School Christmas Tree. When I was six we all went south for my mother's health. We stopped in New York and Washington and Richmond. At the hotel in Washington I was much impressed with seeing Tom Thumb and his theatrical company at special tables in the big dining room. Two occurrences stand uppermost in my memory of Edenton, N.C. where we stopped during the winter months, -- starting in school and seeing a murderer hanged! The school was kept by two of four maiden sisters. Their home was historically interesting having been built for the bride of the first governor of the state. The house was of Colonial design and the oak paneling in the main rooms was brought from England in a sailing vessel. The school room was one of the old slave houses, in the second story reached by an outside stairway. there was much whitewash on the walls both outside and in. The desks were placed against the walls with continuous benches. When studying you faced the wall but turned around on your bench for recitations. The study of arithmetic was started with \\"sums\\" in those days. When the time came for our return to New York state a party was given me by the teachers in their beautiful rose garden and supper was served in the large paneled dining room. One little boy had to come to the party barefooted because he had six toes on one foot and could not get shoes to fit. Of course I would remember that! Many, many years later some of our friends went to Edenton and there met the two remaining sisters who, learning my address, sent me a box of roses from this self-same garden. Part of the trip home was by boat, from Norfolk to New York, and I recall my brother talking me, at Norfolk, to see men fishing for oysters. Back in Rochester I attended private schools, roamed about the city and on the beaches of Lake Ontario, in summer; skated, and built snow \\"igloos\\" in winter. The fall of '76 my father took me to the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia and not a thing escaped me from the making of pins to the big Corliss engine, at the time the largest engine in the world. In 1878 I spent a summer in Saratoga Springs where my mother went for the benefits of the spring waters, and that autumn we returned to live in Mount Morris in the beautiful valley of the Genesee. Followed three years of hotel life, six years of boarding school and Boston Tech, -- this for the study of architecture, -- and six years of architectural business in rochester. In the meantime, we began to know Arizona, and rather better than the average easterner. My brother, seeking health and adventure, introduced us by letter and description. His life there is taken care of in Pioneer Archives and in his book \\"The Log of an Arizona Trail Blazer.\\" While he was acting as \\"professor\\" at the University of Arizona he obtained an appointment for me on the faculty, and I came in 1895, but even then I did not realize that it would be the beginning of my eligibility for the Historical and Pioneer Society. After two years my life was in the east again, \\"architecting\\" traveling by bicycle in Continental Europe and Great Britain, and keeping house for my father after my mother's death in 1900. I might mention that my trip abroad was aided by revenue from cattle investments in Arizona, at the N.Y. Ranch in Cochise County. Father at the age of 79 retired from business and went to Tombstone to be with my brother and his family, and I was in an architect's offices and my own in Detroit and Buffalo, but arrived in Tombstone in 1909, and remained until my father's release from months of physical failure. His funeral and burial were in Mount Morris in 1911. You know \\"The cactus gets under the skin\\", and I was happy, after four winters of sleet and ice and sore-throat, to arrive once more in sunny Tucson. It seemed that I might stay two months to visit my brother and his wife and my two young nieces and nephew, but the months stretched into years, nine of them, before I went east to sell all but the cemetery lot and return. In the meantime I visited California during the winter of 1915-16, and in the spring became connected with the office at Architect H.O. Jaastad in Tucson, and, at the time of writing, December 1933, I am still in that office, principally as designer. Some of the buildings in Tucson with which I have had the most personal touch are the Safford School, Southern Arizona Bank and Trust Co. building, Christian Science church, the first buildings of the Desert Sanatorium, El Conquistador Hotel, La Fonda Buen Provecho Inn, The Young Women's Christian Association building, and many residences within and without the city limits. In other parts of the state and New Mexico are more designs, mostly schools, The Allison-James school in Santa Fe, the Menaul School in Albuquerque. In Safford, Arizona, a hotel, church, and bank building. In Miami Ariz., a school, church, and Y.M.C.A., etc. As a resident of Tucson I am an interested member of several clubs besides the Historical and Pioneer Society, among then The Archeological society, The Natural History society, The Fine Arts, The Daughters of the American Revolution, The business and Professional Women's Club, The Tucson branch of the National League of American Pen women, and a long time board member of the Y.W.C.A. and at present sponsor for their business girls group, the Otonka Circle. When business permits I spend some time each year with my brother and sister-in-law in cochise Stronghold, riding their horses, and climbing the mountains, and a part of the summers \\"doing something different\\" each year, but always including happy contacts with my nieces and nephews and their children in California, and when possible with those in Massachusetts. In the last ten or fifteen years I have visited Alaska, Hawaii, Panama, Cuba, Grand Canyon, Ariz.; Mesa Verde, Colorado; Santa Fe and Indian villages and ruins in New Mexico; Zion National Park and Bryce Canyon; Mexico; and have traveled by horse, rail, bus, boat, auto, and airplane, yet so far I have missed Roosevelt Dam, The Apache Trail. and a few other places.

The film was declared a super-hit at the box office, grossing Rs. 65 crores, which sums to Rs. 114 crores at present day.  Plot  In the United States in 2008, the FBI arrest Omar Aijaz (Neil Nitin Mukesh), a young Muslim man originally from Delhi, after finding guns in the trunk of a taxi cab he owned. Omar is then taken into custody and interrogated by FBI Agent Roshan (Irrfan Khan), also a Muslim man originally from South Asia who has been living in the United States for twenty years. Omar then discovers that he was set up by the FBI to force him to spy on a former college friend, Sameer Sheikh (John Abraham), whom he has not seen in seven years and who the FBI believes is a terrorist. In the process, Omar discovers that Sam has married Maya (Katrina Kaif), a mutual friend whom Omar had a crush on in university and finds out that Sameer and Maya have a young son, Danyal (Aidan Wagner). Roshan orders Omar to tell him everything he knows about Sameer. The film then flashes back to September 1999, when Omar begins his studies at the New York State University. He is befriended by his international student counselor Maya and learns that though she was born and raised in New York, she is fluent in Hindi because of her mother's interest in Bollywood films. Omar also meets Sam, an American Muslim who is also fluent in Hindi due to the fact that his father is a professor of Indian studies. Over the next two years, all three become inseparable friends and gradually Omar falls in love with Maya. When Omar realises that she loves Sam, however, he distances himself from them both. Their carefree days finally end with the onset of the September 11 attacks, or 9/11. After finishing his story, Omar agrees to help Roshan (rather reluctantly), if only to prove that both he and Sam are innocent. He reunites with Maya and Sam and stays in their house, all the while spying for the FBI. Omar learns that Maya is a civil rights activist who is helping one of Sam's employees, Zilgai (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) overcome his experience as a former 9/11 detainee. Zilgai was eventually released due to lack of evidence and has been having difficulty adjusting back to normal life. As time progresses, Omar feels satisfied that he can find nothing to warrant the FBI's suspicions and is ready to leave when a series of events forces him to reconsider. In the process, Omar learns from Sam that ten days after 9/11, Sam was arrested and detained for a period of nine months as a suspected terrorist, a charge which everyone, including the FBI and Roshan, now agree was incorrect. Though he was eventually released due to lack of evidence, the impact of being detained and tortured permanently changed Sam in ways which are difficult for those surrounding him to understand, leaving him with feelings of deep resentment towards the FBI. Omar thus finds that Sam ultimately resorted to plans for terrorism as a means of revenge. In addition, Maya is unable to help Zilgai resolve the trauma of being a detainee. After a routine traffic stop escalates and an NYPD police officer gives Maya a very rough full-body search, Zilgai becomes agitated. He drops Maya at her home and eventually kills the police officer the same night. After being declared a fugitive, Zilgai leads the police on a long chase ultimately ending in his suicide. The climax of the film rests upon the attempts of Maya, Omar, and Roshan to prevent Sam from committing an act of terrorism by telling him that if he perpetuates towards terrorism, others will suffer as he has. Finally convinced, Sam surrenders and aborts his attempt to bomb the FBI building. However, the moment he drops his cell-phone (which was originally intended as a detonator for the bomb) he is shot and killed by FBI snipers. The cell phone falls benign to the ground without activating anything. Maya, who was running toward Sam, is also killed by stray gunfire and Omar, bereft of speech, breaks down. Six months later, Omar is comforted by Roshan who explains to him that; everybody was right in their place, but the timing was wrong. As for Sam, the path he chose killed him. Everybody has moved on after 9/11, as its high time. Omar has adopted Danyal, and Roshan has received commendation for aiding in the anti-terrorism cause. They reconcile each other. The film ends with all three of them going out for pasta and a side note describing the after-effects of 9/11.

In a June 2009 interview with the Indo- Asian News Service (IANS), director Kabir Khan argued that the film \\"is based on part of the political canvas of 9/11, but it speaks of prejudices after the great human tragedy. It is a definite and very relevant subject about post-9/11 prejudices that have increased after the attacks [...] We have in fact divided time in a pre- and post-9/11 world in the film to highlight its obvious repercussions in times to come. The repercussions of the attacks are still very strongly felt globally and will continue to do so.\\" Khan continued to state that the film had the full support of the New York Film Commission, \\" as it is not an anti-something film. It is a very balanced story and not a jingoistic film.\\" In a separate interview with IANS, actor John Abraham argued that, \\"in its own strange way, New York begins where Pakistani film Khuda Ke Liye ended. That's the interesting part of the film [...] Each director has his own way of interpreting and researching the plight of legal detainees.\\" Abraham continued by suggesting that this is why Khan and Shoaib Mansoor offer different interpretations of these events in their respective films. The plot of New York is similar to The Greater Good, the twenty-first episode of the first season of ABC TV series Lost. New York was the first Indian film which focused on this theme, later followed by Karan Johar's My Name is Khan (2010) starring Shahrukh Khan and Kajol, Kurbaan (2009) starring Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor, and Vishwaroopam (2013) starring Kamal Haasan and Andrea Jeremiah. Production Production began in September 2008 and filming lasted over a period of 100 days. Most of the shoot took place in New York although some of the scenes which took place in New York were actually shot in Philadelphia. New York is the first Hindi film to have a production schedule there. In preparation for his role as an American Muslim of Indian origin, Abraham studied the Quran (he had likewise studied Sanskrit and learned to play the flute for his role in Water (2005)). Khan had to submit his script for approval from U.S. authorities before making the film. He stated: \\"We had to submit the script to seek permission to shoot in Guantanamo as well as in the States and we got their green signal to go ahead very easily. The film may be about 9/11 and what happens post it, but they did not object to our theme and did not even raise any questions. The US officials were very cooperative and we shot for around 3 days at this high-profile prison.\\"  Soundtrack  The soundtrack of New York was released on 10 June 2009. The songs and the theme featured in the soundtrack are composed by Pritam, Julius Packiam and Pankaj Awasthi and the lyrics are penned by Sandeep Shrivastava and Junaid Wasi. Julius Packiam composed the film score. The remix version of \\"Hai Junoon\\" used in the end credits of the film is sung by K.K. & Monali Thakur and not available in the original soundtrack. All the songs proved to be major hits post release with the songs \\"Hai Junoon\\" and \\"Tune Jo Na Kaha\\" declared as chartbusters. Release Box office New York grossed a record Rs. 35 million during its first 3 days in India, with theatres at their highest occupancy since January at 80‚Äì85%. During its first week, it ranked #1 at the box office in India and grossed Rs. 618.9 million worldwide, and was declared a hit. Its total gross in India after a 6-week run was Rs. . New York's opening weekend was highly successful in India and the Middle East. It also proved popular in Australia and did well in the UK and U.S. Of its opening in India, Khan commented: \\"I always believed that New York will be a word-of- mouth film which would open on a decent note and then show an increase in business with every passing day. When I was told by friends and people from industry that it had opened to a housefull response in the very first show at so many places across the country, even I was taken aback.\\" It became the sixth highest-grossing film of 2009, grossing Rs. . Critical Reception New York was universally well received by all critics. Subhash K. Jha gave New York a rave review arguing that New York \\"is what cinema in contemporary times should be, must be, though it seldom is\\" and designates it \\"an important film\\" which \\"cares about the prejudices that have taken over the world. Jha also states that, \\"stereotypical portrayals of the cultural diaspora are fortunately rare in this piece of contemporary art which has plenty of heart, a heart that never overflows in an embarrassing torrent of emotions.\\" Devansh Patel, film critic for London's Hounslow Chronicle, gave New York 5 out of 5 stars stating that it is, \\"the most thought provoking movie Yash Raj Films has ever come up with.\\" Nikhat Kazmi of the Times of India gave it 4 out of 5 stars, describing New York as, \\"an extremely taut and highly emotive piece of political drama [...] topical, meaningful, and entertaining, all at the same time.\\" Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave it four out of five stars arguing that New York is \\"one of the finest films produced by this premier production house, Yash Raj [...] the screenplay is its biggest star, without a doubt. Given the fact that New York isn't one of those routine masala fares, Kabir has injected songs only when required. Cinematography is striking.\\" Joginder Tuteja of the Indo-Asian News Service (IANS) calls the film \\"a must- watch\\" and gave it 4 out of 4 stars. He states: \\"When a hardcore commercial flick gets a standing ovation and a huge round of applause at the end of the show, you know that there is something definitely right that the director has done. In this regard, Kabir Khan can take a bow because he has done exceedingly well in making a film that is not frivolous, has a message and still carries enough commercial ingredients to reach out to masses as well as classes.\\" jayant of the Hindustan Times argues that comparing New York \\"to Mark Pellington's Arlington Road would be grossly unfair. If anything, this is a much better movie than that 1999, part-spooky conspiracy theory. The central theme itself is closer to Shoaib Mansoor's Khuda Kay Liye (2007), and you can sense how the superior execution here makes all the filmmaking difference.\\" Additionally, Shekhar describes New York in NDTV as, \\"an A-list film that gets a straight A.\\" Sandhya Iyer of the Sakaal Times gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars arguing that \\"New York manages to be gripping, thanks to an excellent screenplay. Most importantly, the story has the right mix of realism and drama ‚Äì one that Kabir Khan unfolds with quiet confidence.\\" Mathures Paul of The Statesman states: \\"Finally, here's a film that entertains and makes viewers think.\\" https://www.metacritic.com/movie/new-york High profile screenings New York was the opening film for the 33rd Cairo International Film Festival on 10 November 2009.

She was eldest daughter of Penda. Although her father was an opponent of Christianity, she and all her siblings converted. Bede wrote that Penda tolerated the preaching of Christianity in Mercia itself, despite his own beliefs: :\\"Nor did King Penda obstruct the preaching of the word among his people, the Mercians, if any were willing to hear it; but, on the contrary, he hated and despised those whom he perceived not to perform the works of faith, when they had once received the faith, saying, They were contemptible and wretched who did not obey their God, in whom they believed. This was begun two years before the death of King Penda.Bede, B. III, Ch. XXI Their mother was Queen Cyneswise. Tibba is believed to have been a relative. Kyneburga married Alhfrith of Deira, co-regent of Northumbria (who attended the Synod of Whitby in 664),Bede(d. 735), Ecclesiastical History of the English People. and later founded an abbey for both monks and nuns in Castor, in the Soke of Peterborough.Dugdale's Monasticon prints the foundation charter of Burh/Medehampstead, dated 664, which establishes beyond doubt that Kyneburg had left her husband to found and preside over her monastery at Castor: \\"Formerly a queen, who had resigned her sway to preside over a monastery of maidens\\". She became the first abbess and was later joined by Kyneswide and Tibba. Kyneswide succeeded Kyneburga as abbess and she was later succeeded by Tibba. She was buried in her church, but the remains of Kyneburga and Kyneswide were translated, before 972,The account of the translation is from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, dated 972: \\"Abbot Aelfsi took up St Kyneburgh (with her sister and a female kinswoman) who lay at Castor and brought them to Burh and offered them all to St Peter in one day\\". to Peterborough Abbey, now Peterborough Cathedral.

The inn also has a claim to being the most haunted pub in England, one landlard asserting the presence of 89 resident apparitions. Aside from these claims, it is best known locally for its rock music and has been described by local historian Dave Mooney as \\"an old fashioned rock and bike pub.\\" History Early Medieval period Although much of the city's historic centre is built on man-made caves, those beneath The Salutation are unusually large. They consist of two levels of rock-cut cellars with stone-slab shelves used to keep food cool in the days before domestic refrigeration and a well shaft sunk into the rock. Constructed in four stages, they pre-date the construction of the inn. An investigation by the Thoroton Excavation Society in 1937 dated the caves to the 9th century and concluded that they were part of a Saxon farm. The caves are opened to visitors at the discretion of the landlord. High and Late Medieval periods A 13th-century alehouse known as \\"The Archangel Gabriel Salutes the Virgin Mary\\" is believed to have been constructed on this site in 1240. The name, which refers to the Hail Mary greeting given by Gabriel to Mary, mother of Jesus, was one commonly given to the guesthouses of religious institutions, leading to speculation that it may have been associated with either the Whitefriars Carmelite monastery or Greyfriars Franciscan friary, which were both nearby, but no documentary evidence has been found to support this. Crusading knights are said to have stoppped for food at the alehouse on their way to the Holy Land. During King Edward III's residence at the nearby Nottingham Castle in 1336 many of his retinue were accommodated in the building, then known as Ye House by ye Sign of Salutation. The core of the current building, dated to around 1360 by dendrochronology carried out by the University of Nottingham in 1992, was a workshop for the city's tanner with living accommodation above. The building has been described by local historian John Holland Walker as \\"a typical mediaeval dwelling-house and shop of the better sort.\\" Borough records indicate the presence on the site of a hostel for travellers and journeymen in 1414 and a private dwelling belonging to a John Alastre in 1440. During this time the caves provided a hiding place for Jews escaping persecution, a home for a colony of lepers, and servants' accommodation and brewing space for the alehouse and hostel. Tudor and Stuart periods During the English Civil War (1642‚Äì1646) both factions established recruiting rooms in the Inn. Local legend claims that leading Parliamentarians, including Oliver Cromwell, signed King Charles I's death warrant in the inn. During the the Protectorate the civic leaders, objecting to the religious implications, had the sign taken down and inn renamed The Soldier and Citizen. After the Restoration in 1660, when the inn was given its current name and a sign depicting a pair of shaking hands, a brothel occupied what is now the Dining Room and a sweet shop occupied what is now the Cromwell Room. Georgian period The inn had acquired a sinister reputation by the late 17th century and was a hangout for highwaymen, including Dick Turpin, who local legend claims was almost apprehended in the caves below, and John Nevison, who made the famous ride from Kent to York. A 20-course banquet was held in the inn in 1788 in celebration of the hundredth anniversary of the Glorious Revolution. The inn was the site of a tragedy in 1820 when domestic oatmeal was contaminated with arsenic procured to exterminate rats, killing landlord John Green and poisoning the rest of his household. Victorian and Edwardian periods The room now known as the King Charles Snug is said to date from this period. Modern period Extensions to the inn in 1966 included the hanging of a wrought-iron hand outside which was stolen that same night. The inn was featured along with its rivals Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem and the Bell Inn in a 1998 episode of the Channel 4 TV series History Hunters which used records, building architecture and timbers, and local legends to decide which was truly the oldest. The programme makers concluded that while The Sal had the oldest building and Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem had the oldest caves, the Bell Inn was the oldest pub.

During World War I she was known as USAT Kentuckian in service for the United States Army and USS Kentuckian (ID-1544) in service for the United States Navy. After her Navy career, she reverted to her original name of SS Kentuckian. She was built by the Maryland Steel Company as first of three ships ordered by the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company, and was employed in inter-coastal service via the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and the Panama Canal after it opened. In World War I, USAT Kentuckian carried cargo and animals to France under charter to the U.S. Army. When transferred to the U.S. Navy in December 1918, a month after the Armistice, USS Kentuckian was converted to a troop transport and returned almost 8,900 American troops from France. Returned to American-Hawaiian in 1919, Kentuckian resumed inter- coastal cargo service. Shortly before World War II, Kentuckian was requisitioned by the War Shipping Administration and sailed between Trinidad and African ports, between New York and Caribbean ports, and in transatlantic convoys through mid 1944. In mid-July 1944, the ship was scuttled as part of the breakwater for one of the Mulberry artificial harbors built to support the Normandy Invasion.  Design and construction  In the second quarter of 1909, American-Hawaiian, looking to expand its fleet, placed an order with the Maryland Steel Company of Sparrows Point, Maryland, for three new cargo ships‚ÄîKentuckian, Georgian, and Honolulan. The contract for the ships required that American-Hawaiian pay $1,000,000 in cash and a further $650,000 in twelve monthly notes at 5% interest. Provisions of the deal allowed that the monthly notes could be converted into longer-term mortgages at 6% interest, and secured by the ships themselves.American-Hawaiian was so pleased by the arrangements with Maryland Steel, and by the ships themselves, that they gave Maryland Steel the monopoly for all future construction, a further eleven ships by 1914. See: Cochran and Ginger, pp. 358, 365. The final cost of Kentuckian, including financing costs, was $58.33 per deadweight ton, which came out to just under $579,000. Kentuckian (Maryland Steel yard no. 104) was the first ship built under the contract. She was launched on 19 March 1910, by Miss Nancy Johnson, the daughter of U.S. Representative Ben Johnson (D-KY), who christened the ship with sparkling spring water from the Kentucky farms of Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis.Senator and Mrs. William Edgar Borah (R-ID) and the wives of Representative Joseph F. Howell (D-UT) and former senator Thomas H. Paynter (D-KY) were among the invited guests at the noon launching ceremony. All had taken a special train from Washington, D.C. at 10:00 that morning. The completed ship, delivered to American-Hawaiian on 1 June, was , and was in length (between perpendiculars) and abeam. She had a deadweight tonnage of , and her cargo holds had a storage capacity of . Kentuckian had a single quadruple-expansion steam engine powered by oil-fired boilers that drove a single screw propeller at a speed of .  Early career  When Kentuckian began sailing for American-Hawaiian, the company shipped cargo from East Coast ports via the Tehuantepec Route to West Coast ports and Hawaii, and vice versa. Shipments on the Tehuantepec Route would arrive at Mexican ports‚ÄîSalina Cruz, Oaxaca, for eastbound cargo, and Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, for westbound cargo‚Äîand would traverse the Isthmus of Tehuantepec on the Tehuantepec National Railway.Hovey, p. 78. Eastbound shipments were primarily sugar and pineapple from Hawaii, while westbound cargoes were more general in nature.Cochran and Ginger, p. 355‚Äì56. Kentuckian sailed in this service but it is not clear from sources whether on the east or west side of North America. After the United States occupation of Veracruz on 21 April 1914 (which found six American-Hawaiian ships in Mexican ports), the Huerta-led Mexican government closed the Tehuantepec National Railway to American shipping. This loss of access coupled with the fact that the Panama Canal was not yet open, caused American-Hawaii to return in late April to its historic route of sailing around South America via the Straits of Magellan.Cochran and Ginger, p. 360. With the opening of the Panama Canal on 15 August, American- Hawaiian ships switched to taking that route. In October 1915, landslides closed the Panama Canal and all American-Hawaiian ships, including Kentuckian, returned to the Straits of Magellan route again.Cochran and Ginger, p. 361. Kentuckians exact movements from this time through early 1918 are unclear. She may have been in the half of the American-Hawaiian fleet that was chartered for transatlantic service. She may also have been in the group of American- Hawaiian ships chartered for service to South America, delivering coal, gasoline, and steel in exchange for coffee, nitrates, cocoa, rubber, and manganese ore.Cochran and Ginger, p. 362.  World War I  At some point after the United States declared war on Germany in April 1917, the United States Army chartered Kentuckian for transporting animals to Europe in support of the American Expeditionary Force.Crowell and Wilson, p. 529. Although there is no information about the specific conversion of Kentuckian, for other ships this typically meant that any passenger accommodations had to be ripped out and replaced with ramps and stalls for the horses and mules carried.Crowell and Wilson, pp. 313‚Äì14. Details about Kentuckians first animal transport journey are not known, but her second trip began 14 March 1918 when she sailed from Newport News, Virginia, with 848 animals for Saint-Nazaire, where she unloaded all but the four animals that had died or were destroyed during the voyage. On 24 April, during a convoy crossing in Army service, Naval Armed Guardsmen on Kentuckian sighted a torpedo heading towards the second ship behind her in the column. Opening fire on the torpedo, the gun crew claimed the hit that caused the torpedo to explode short of its intended target. Further details of Kentuckians Army service are not available. With the signing of the Armistice on 11 November, the fighting came to an end and the task of bringing home American soldiers began almost immediately.Gleaves, p. 31. To that end, Kentuckian was acquired by the United States Navy on 16 December, and commissioned on 28 January 1919 with Lieutenant Commander Carrol E. Higgins, NAR, in command. Before she could begin returning troops, though, Kentuckian had to undergo conversion from a cargo and animal ship. Though sources do not indicate the specific modifications Kentuckian underwent, typical conversions for other ships included the installation of berths for troops, and adding greatly expanded cooking and toilet facilities to handle the large numbers of men aboard.Crowell and Wilson, p. 316. Similar modifications on a fellow American-Hawaiian cargo ship, the two-years-younger , took three months, but it is not known how long Kentuckians refit took. USS Kentuckian returns American troops in 1919. Kentuckian departed New York for her first trooping voyage on 2 March, picking up nearly 2,000 soldiers at Saint-Nazaire‚Äîamong them some 1,500 men of the 363rd Infantry Regiment of the U.S. 91st Infantry Division, and a number from the U.S. 33rd Infantry Division‚Äîbefore returning to New York on 1 April.363rd Infantry, 91st Infantry Division: 33rd Infantry Division: Her arrival on another trooping run in June returned 1,860 men, including over 1,500 members of the 345th Field Artillery Regiment of the U.S. 90th Infantry Division. An officer of that unit brought back a black police dog named Pat, who, purportedly, had been the personal dog of Germany's Crown Prince Wilhelm. Another trip in July returned another 1,852 men from Saint-Nazaire. In all, Kentuckian made a total of five trooping runs from France, bringing back 8,895 men by the time she completed her last trip on 31 August at Norfolk, Virginia. She was decommissioned on 15 September and returned to American-Hawaiian the same day.  Interwar years  Kentuckian resumed cargo service with American-Hawaiian after her return from World War I service. Though the company had abandoned its original Hawaiian sugar routes by this time,Cochran and Ginger, p. 363 Kentuckian continued inter-coastal service through the Panama Canal with a few incidents that interrupted what was a mostly uneventful twenty years. In September 1928, a day after sailing from San Francisco, Kentuckian was rammed by the General Petroleum tanker Los Alamos near Point Sur, California, in a thick fog. Kentuckian had a leak in her number two cargo hold and damage to her port bilge keel and returned to San Francisco for repairs. In early April 1933, a fire broke out in Kentuckians number two cargo hold, which resulted in the delay of the ship at Panama from 8 to 14 April. Kentuckian made her way to Los Angeles over the next ten days, where surveyors examined the ship and her general cargo. For the most part, Kentuckian primarily carried general cargoes whose contents were not noteworthy.Arrival notices in the Los Angeles Times, for example, generally only noted the quantity of cargo carried by Kentuckian. For a typical report, see: One exception occurred in July 1929, when The New York Times reported that Kentuckian was carrying, Pirate, an R-class racing yacht to races at Larchmont and Marblehead. The newspaper reported that Pirate was the first West Coast designed and built yacht to race in the East. SS Kentuckian sailed in eleven transatlantic convoys, like this typical one, seen in 1942. Unlike , a fellow American-Hawaiian ship that was plagued with labor difficulties,See: Kentuckian seems to have escaped much of the maritime labor turmoil of the mid-1930s. One incident was reported by the Los Angeles Times in August 1936. The news item reported that a portion of Kentuckians crew went on strike in protest against unsafe working conditions. The ship's master had ordered the deckhands to rig one of the cargo booms after the ship docked in Los Angeles, but they refused because the deck was slippery and therefore, in their opinion, unsafe.There was no follow up report indicating the ultimate resolution of the incident.  World War II  Shortly before the United States entered World War II, Kentuckian was requisitioned by the War Shipping Administration (WSA), but continued to be operated by American-Hawaiian. On 19 November 1941, Kentuckian sailed from New York for Durban, where she arrived on 21 December. Kentuckian spent the next two months sailing between ports in South Africa and Mozambique, calling at Port Elizabeth, Cape Town, and East London in the former, and Lourenco Marques, and Beira in the latter, before heading to Trinidad from Cape Town on 28 February 1942. Arriving at Trinidad three weeks later, she made her way up to Boston by early April, before putting in at New York for about six weeks. Sailing from New York in late May, Kentuckian joined a southbound Hampton Roads, Virginia ‚Äì Key West, Florida convoy. She left the convoy before Key West and headed back across the Atlantic to Cape Town, where she arrived on 7 July. Kentuckian spent the next month sailing between Cape Town, East London, and Durban. Kentuckian concluded her second trip to Africa when she sailed for South America on 1 August. After a three-week crossing of the South Atlantic, Kentuckian arrived at Paramaribo on 22 August, where she took on a load of bauxite and made her way to New York, where she docked on 20 September. The cargo ship slowly made her way south, calling at Charleston, Key West, and Guant√°namo Bay along her way to Trinidad, where she arrived on 5 November. Sailing 11 November, Kentuckian began her third and final trip to Africa. She arrived at Freetown on 25 November and called at Bathurst and Takoradi over the next two months before returning to Trinidad on 31 January 1943. Sailing from Trinidad on 4 February, she called at Guant√°namo Bay and Baltimore on her way to New York, where, arriving in late March, she prepared to begin transatlantic convoy sailings to the United Kingdom. On 1 April, Kentuckian, loaded with grain and general cargo, departed as a part of Convoy HX-232, the 232nd New York ‚Äì Halifax ‚Äì Liverpool convoy. Developing some unreported problem, she returned to New York on 3 April. The problem must have been minor, because she sailed as part of Convoy HX-233 three days later. This convoy was attacked by no fewer than eight German submarines,Haskell, p. 90. which resulted in the loss of only one ship, the British cargo ship Fort Rampart,Haskell, p. 92. and the sinking of by convoy escorts.Haskell, pp. 93‚Äì102. There is no evidence that Kentuckian played any direct part in the sinking of the German submarine, but, nevertheless, members of her Naval Armed Guard were awarded a battle star for actions in the convoy from 16‚Äì18 April.Haskell, p. 40.Haskell reports that the Naval Armed Guardsmen of all the American-flagged ships in Convoy HX-233 were awarded a battle star, even though the Armed Guard contingents on some of the ships were unaware that a submarine had been sighted, much less sunk. Merchant seamen on the vessels received no such award. See: Haskell, pp. 40‚Äì41. Kentuckian arrived at Liverpool on 21 April. Over the next ten months, Kentuckian made nine more convoy crossings between the UK‚Äîwhere she called at Liverpool, Swansea, Milford Haven, Methil, Loch Ewe, Immingham, and Belfast Lough‚Äîand New York. She ended her tenth North Atlantic crossing when she arrived at New York on 16 February 1944. caissons from the Mulberry Harbor at Arromanches-les-Bains as seen in May 2005. SS Kentuckian was scuttled as part of the breakwater to protect the harbor. Sailing from New York on 26 February, Kentuckian made two circuits between that port and the Caribbean, calling at Nuevitas, Cuba, and Manat√≠, Puerto Rico, and making stops at Key West and Philadelphia along the way, before putting in at New York on 15 April. Kentuckian departed the United States for the final time on 19 May and headed for Milford Haven. After arriving there on 3 June, the cargo ship arrived at Barry via Plymouth, Belfast Lough, and Falmouth, on 27 June. Departing Barry on 8 July as a part of Convoy EBC-35, Kentuckian arrived at Arromanches on 10 July and was scuttled there as part of a breakwater protecting the mulberry harbor constructed there in support of the Normandy invasion. In March 1945, the WSA offered a payment of $565,910 to American- Hawaiian for Kentuckian as part of a $7.2 million settlement for eleven requisitioned American-Hawaiian ships that had either been sunk, scuttled (like Kentuckian), or were to be retained by the government.

In 2008, two former generals were jailed for life for his disappearance.Argentine chiefs jailed for life, BBC Online, 28 August 2008. Vargas Aignasse was born and raised in Andalgal√°, Catamarca Province, and was a physicist by profession, teaching in the discipline until his election to the Provincial Senate of Tucum√°n in 1973. He was elected on the Frejuli ticket that brought Peronists back to power, and was associated with the left-wing faction of Peronism, having belonged to the center-left FANE (National Student Associations Front).P√°gina/12: Hay muchos fantasmas que lo abruman Diario del Cuyo: Guardia de Hierro del PJ Amid the worst climate of violence in the country, Tucum√°n Province was placed under martial law in January 1975, after which Operativo Independencia, a counterinsurgency offensive, was launched by presidential order. The installation of General Antonio Domingo Bussi as its commander in December coincided with Vargas Aignasse's investigation of provincial Police Chief Colonel Antonio Arrechea on reports of drug trafficking. The 1976 military coup, on March 24, resulted in Vargas Aignasse's arrest by provincial police, who had their detainee turn in all documentation regarding the Arrechea case. Days later, his brother, Rodolfo, was allowed to see the prisoner from above a patio, following which, per police testimony, he was released from prison on 5 April and 'kidnapped by parties unknown' while being taken home in an official car. He was later reportedly seen alive and in pain by a number of witnesses, though his whereabouts afterwards remained unknown. Unable to do so until after the return of democracy in 1983, Rodolfo Vargas Aignasse filed a missing persons case on February 6, 1984. Ultimately, and despite the unwillingness of numerous witnesses to testify, Bussi was arrested for ordering Vargas Aignasse's abduction, on October 15, 2003.Dictamen de procesamiento de Indictment of Generals Antonio Domingo Bussi and Luciano Benjam√≠n Men√©ndez, Federal Appeals Court of Tucum√°n During the trial that formally began on July 2008, former trade union leader Juan Antonio Palavecino testified that he had seen Vargas Aignasse in Tucum√°n police headquarters showing signs of torture on April 6, 1976, one day after his supposed kidnapping, and contrary to the official story.

Initial board members were appointed by U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, whose department provided start-up funds and support with the goal of \\"supporting a comprehensive research and development program to harness the increasing capacity of advanced information and digital technologies to improve all levels of learning and education, formal and informal, in order to provide Americans with the knowledge and skills needed to compete in the global economy.\\" Logo Masthead of the Congressionally authorized nonprofit organization \\"Digital Promise\\" History More than a decade ago, the Carnegie Corporation of New York joined with the Century Foundation to launch the Digital Promise Project, an initiative to recommend policies that could harness breakthrough technologies to advance the public good. Project co- chairs, former FCC Chairman Newton N. Minow and former NBC News and PBS President Lawrence K. Grossman, published their project recommendations in a book titled A Digital Gift to the Nation. At the request of Congress, the Digital Promise Project, in partnership with the Federation of American Scientists, developed a road map for transforming teaching and learning with technology in the digital age.

On March 31, 1946, the first meeting of the board took place, during which Major Boles≈Çaw Rudzi≈Ñski was elected the chairman of G√≥rnik. In August 1946, Kazimierz Nabielec, who used to play for Pogo≈Ñ Lw√≥w, formed Autonomous Football Federation at Wa≈Çbrzych (former German Waldenburg). In 1947, first local football championship took place, with G√≥rnik-Zamek, as the team was then called, finishing in the last position. In 1948, G√≥rnik-Zamek merged with the team of Huta Karol, and in 1949, with Chrobry, Julia and Mieszko. As a result, by 1950, a powerful football team was created, with financial support of most local coal mines. In 1950, G√≥rnik already played in the third level of Polish football system. Even though it failed to win promotion to the second league, Polish Football Association (PZPN) decided to expand the second division to four groups, with ten teams in each. As a result of this, G√≥rnik was attached to the third group of the second division. The team from Walbrzych won its group in the 1951 season, finishing before G√≥rnik Zabrze, and winning a spot in the Ekstraklasa playoffs. In the playoffs, which featured four teams (Lechia Gda≈Ñsk, Wawel Krakow, Gwardia Warszawa), G√≥rnik won only one game, losing five. In 1953, the PZPN decided to reduce the number of teams in the second division, from 40 to 14. G√≥rnik finished the season in the comfortable 6th position, and in 1954, it also was the 6th team. In 1958, G√≥rnik was relegated from the second division, to remain there until 1963. In 1961, G√≥rnik's U-19 team won silver in Polish championship. In 1962, the PZPN decided to change the whole system of Polish football championship, introducing the autumn - spring games. As a result, additional playoffs were necessary for G√≥rnik to remain in the second division. The team from Wa≈Çbrzych managed to beat MGKS Mikulczyce (later Sparta Zabrze), after an extra, third game, which took place in Opole. G√≥rnik played in the second division until 1970. Its top player was Henryk Kempny, formerly of Legia Warszawa. In 1967, Gornik finished third, behind Gwardia Warszawa and Odra Opole. In 1968 in Mielec, G√≥rnik won gold in the U-19 Polish Championship. In 1969, the team again finished third in the Second Division, behind Gwardia Warszawa and Cracovia, but in 1970 it was relegated to the Third Division. G√≥rnik remained there for a year, and in 1971/72, it was again close to promotion to the Ekstraklasa. In 1973, the U-19 team, with W≈Çodzimierz Ciolek and Henryk Janikowski, once again won Polish Championship, but in the same year, G√≥rnik was again relegated to the third level. Under new manager Stanislaw Swierk, and with several young talents, Gornik won the third level games, and the playoffs to the second division, beating in the final game G√≥rnik Knur√≥w (Wa≈Çbrzych, 16 July 1976). In the 1977/78 season, Gornik was very close to the promotion to the Ekstraklasa, but failed and finished the games behind GKS Katowice. As a result, several top players left Wa≈Çbrzych: W≈Çodzimierz Cio≈Çek went to Stal Mielec, while Marek Pieta went to Widzew ≈Å√≥d≈∫. Stanis≈Çaw ≈öwierk was replaced by the new manager, Horst Panic. In the 1982/83 season of the second division, Gornik was by far the best team, winning the promotion four games before the end of the season. With W≈Çodzimierz Cio≈Çek back from Mielec, Gornik was a sensation in the autumn of 1983, finishing the round in the first position. In the spring of 1984, however, G√≥rnik lost several important games, and finished the season in the sixth spot. In 1984/85 Gornik was eight, and in 1985/86, sixth. Its top players at that time were W≈Çodzimierz Cio≈Çek, Leszek Kosowski and Ryszard Spaczy≈Ñski. In 1986/87, G√≥rnik, without Cio≈Çek, who had been transferred to Switzerland, finished in the 10th spot. After the 1987/88 season, to avoid relegation G√≥rnik was in the playoffs, managing to beat Zag≈Çƒôbie Lubin. The 1988/89 season was the last one so far for G√≥rnik Wa≈Çbrzych in the Ekstraklasa. Under managers Henryk Kempny and Ryszard Mordak, G√≥rnik was relegated. All together, the team from Wa≈Çbrzych played 6 seasons in Polish top league, with goal difference 194‚Äì246. G√≥rnik won 53 games, tied 56 and lost 73. The end of Communist system in Poland meant that G√≥rnik lost financial support of local coal mines. A difficult financial situation of sports clubs in Wa≈Çbrzych meant that in the early 1990s Zag≈Çƒôbie Wa≈Çbrzych merged with its fierce rivals G√≥rnik Wa≈Çbrzych much to the shock of both sets of fans after over 40 years of rivalry. The new merged club then became \\"KP Wa≈Çbrzych\\", then \\"KP G√≥rnik/Zag≈Çƒôbie Wa≈Çbrzych\\". Matches were played at Zag≈Çƒôbie's stadium but eventually the Zag≈Çƒôbie part was dropped from the name and the rival club de facto ceased to exist, leaving only G√≥rnik.
